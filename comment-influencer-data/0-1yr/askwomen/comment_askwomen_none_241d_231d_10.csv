Give more affection that‚Äôs just affection and not pre-sex affection. 
"Put things back in their place, not just on the nearest available surface (which is too often just the fucking floor). "
"Take care of his health. That man could be shot in the head, and he'd try to convince me he doesn't need a doctor. "
"Lived a double life for most of my life; I‚Äôve only recently become one. 

My mother is an alcoholic and had trouble paying bills and had trouble raising a daughter all on her own. She was also in an domestic abusive relationship from when I was 8 years old to 12 years old.

There were times I came home from school to a ‚Äúfor auction‚Äù sign in front of our home. There were times where we didn‚Äôt have water running, or electricity. There were days she would be too drunk and locked me out of the house and I would have to bang on the door for hours until she realized. 

I was very lonely, sad, and scared. I had nightmares everynight from the age of 8 that my mom's boyfriend would finally kill me like he threatened every so often.... And those nightmares were a luxury that were only afforded to me on the nights him and my mother weren't fighting each other and the police showing up many times to question him about my mom's broken bones and bruises.

BUT anytime I stepped out of that environment I was a different person, living a different life. 

I was the funny girl, the happy girl.  I would lie about vacations my mom took, when she really would be too drunk to show up to parent teacher conferences. After breaks, I would speak to my friends about Christmas trips to the Caribbean and the crazy expensive gifts she bought me that I thought were too fancy to wear to school. My dad, who in reality was a dead beat, I would say was a success lawyer in NYC, who had the coolest high rise apartment that I would show pictures of to my friends (thanks google). Anytime I was invited to a sleepover or someone wanted to come to my house I would lie about being busy and going to visit my dad in his lux apartment.

I couldn‚Äôt let go of these lies when I started college, I would lie about being rich and coming from a successful family. Anything the rich girls had on campus I was sure to also buy for myself, to maintain the mask I had spent years building. I would use the scholarship money I was awarded to buy books for class for north face jackets, American apparel wardrobe, UGG boots, Michelle watches, let‚Äôs just say any and everything.

When that money ran out each semester, I started working overnight, secretly, and also got credit cards, to fund my second life as ""a rich girl with no family problems."" 

I seriously could go on about all of the lies I‚Äôve told to my friends throughout my life, but to wrap it up- Living this double life has done so much emotional damage to me and my relationships. The friends that I had from my middle school and high school years now know the truth but most of them were so stunned and saddened by the lies I had told them that we no longer have a relationship. 

The debt that I accumulated while hiding who I truly was throughout college is still something that I‚Äôm paying for financially.

Mentally, I have to fight the urge to lie to anyone new about my past. 

I lost myself through all of the lies, but I am in therapy now to deal with my past drama. 

My advice is to live your truth no matter how ugly it may be and to ask for help."
"I‚Äôm using my throwaway to answer this. 

When I was 23, I was married with two small kids. I lived in an apartment with meth heads as neighbors and a partner that couldn‚Äôt keep a fucking job. 

So.... I became a stripper. I did it for 15 years. 
Got rid of the guy that wouldn‚Äôt/couldn‚Äôt work and became self-sufficient. 

I never told my kids, they thought i bartended at a high-end country club. So did all the friends and their parents. 

I only ever disclosed my job to men I was dating, bc it was necessary. Some were ok with it? Others not so much. 

It did hurt me and help me in many ways. 

It hurt me because I couldn‚Äôt form deep relationships with women outside of that industry. Now that I‚Äôm retired from dancing? I have almost no clue how to talk to women that haven‚Äôt done that, or something similar, in their careers. I have no real experience of anything else. 
I still don‚Äôt mention it bc it‚Äôs such a stigma, even in 2019. 
I also have a hard time communicating with men. Why with men? I became so used to being objectified and talk at, and a disposable commodity to men and their money, it‚Äôs been a learning process to remember NOT all men are like that.  
Some do treat me as an equal, it‚Äôs a bit unnerving after 15 years of opposite. 

It‚Äôs helped me bc I found my voice doing it. Learned to speak up. How to work, how to budget, and how to have a good time. How to negotiate for what I want. 

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it, as it‚Äôs not for the faint of heart. 

My kids are grown now, and I‚Äôve finally told them. They were great about it. Never judged or condemned me for it. 

And before anyone asks....
I did it that long bc it have the opportunity to be with my kids when they needed me. I was able to move to very nice area and send them to the schools in my city and state. 
I own a home and have no debt. So, financial reasons are why I did it that long. 

So, that‚Äôs my story of my double life. "
"Yes, it took me a good 3 months to start to feel anything, and 5 months before I really loved him and enjoyed him. Before that I was on autopilot and did what I had to do because I knew it was the correct thing to do and because I had no other choice.

This was a planned and very much wanted baby (planned him for 3 years) but it all fell apart when my fianc√© abused, cheated on and left me when I was pregnant, followed by me having my dude at 24w and going through 3 months of NICU. I was told he‚Äôd probably die so i guarded myself. Single parenting was fucking hard as well. In retrospect it‚Äôs obvious I was coping with concealed PND. But I was never diagnosed and I looked normal from the outside. I‚Äôd staunchly deny it anyway.

Once my dude was 5 months (5 and a half weeks corrected), he started smiling and it all changed them. I can remember falling in love with him. No one tells you how hard it is to have a NICU baby that gives zero emotional responses for 5 months other than crying. Once you get that positive feedback it helps."
"They are good people, always treat me really well, but deeper feelings are never mutual. Either they fall for me or I do, but never both. I just think I keep choosing incompatible people, frankly. "
Throw dirty clothes in the hamper instead of next to them
I used to go for Fixer Uppers. Now I‚Äôve hung up my renovation hat and date move in ready people only. 
"i like telling dad jokes.


sometimes he laughs."
"Help with the mental load. We have two kids and a household, and it‚Äôs up to me to remember everything that needs to be done. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm the chef and he‚Äôs my sous chef. He‚Äôs happy to help, but he has to be told how to help. I wish he would just look around and see what needs to be done and do it so I don‚Äôt have the mental load of tracking and managing all 4 of our lives plus our house. "
I‚Äôm an elementary school teacher in my mid twenties. Nuff said.
"I have a weakness for gentle giants‚Äî large, towering guys with the temperament of a kitten. My heart just melts."
"Take more interest in what I do. I feel like I‚Äôm always asking him about the book he‚Äôs reading, about his interests, etc. It‚Äôs rarely every reciprocated. "
"Be thoughtful and plan something for me. I'm always the one who makes our Christmas/Thanksgiving plans to make those days special. I always try to make his birthday and our anniversary special, usually by planning a small weekend trip. He's never done anything like that for me. Not even so much as making a restaurant reservation for Valentines day. "
Dudes who think I'm mysterious and fascinating and then gtfo when they realize I'm a normal human being and pretty boring.
"My daughter was only 6 weeks early and it was so hard having that extra newborn time when they do nothing but cry, can‚Äôt see you, don‚Äôt smile etc. The first time she smiled, I cried my eyes out. It was like my baby finally ‚Äúwoke up‚Äù and could finally interact with me. The first time I noticed that she was actually looking at me and watching me, instead of the blank newborn blindness, I cried and said ‚ÄúHey! I‚Äôm your mama, do you know that? I‚Äôm your mama, sweet girl.‚Äù 

She turns 1 next month. It‚Äôs been amazing. "
"Use his own initiative to tidy/clean up, not just say ‚Äòif you want me to do anything tell me‚Äô.

To be fair to him, this is pretty much his only fault. I‚Äôm very lucky, he‚Äôs a fantastic husband and all round good egg. "
"Understand why I'm not as sexually needy as he is. 

Want me to put out more? Then get me in the mood by doing something without me having to ask. Like come home with groceries without me asking you to. Cook supper without me asking. That's the kind of stuff that makes me happier and less stressed, and ultimately what makes me feel closer in a relationship and less like a mom. "
"Most of the trends I saw in my dating life had more to do with where I was living than a personal preference. 

Small town Texas - either gamers or guys who own pickups and listen to alternative country

Austin - dudes who are working ""freelance"" in tech or food service ""until my band gets signed""

New England - guys who like hiking and/or write poetry "
"If he made dinner or breakfast more often, I can‚Äôt be doing it all the time üôÑ"
I explained this to my bf as in his world there is a magic pixie who goes around putting things away whereas in my world there‚Äôs a magic pixie who takes them out again - he‚Äôs got better since I pointed it out like that 
"I'm a older guy who has the same feelings and experiences. In the end, I've dated quite a few very eligible women with very good intentions and hearts, but for whatever reason it hasn't worked out. So now I've come to the realization the one common denominator in all of those relationships...is me. "
"Which some guys see as ""oh I just have to bribe you with chores"" when in reality it is ""I need you to contibute to taking the weight off of my mind if you want sex to be higher on my priorities because otherwise I have a hundred things I need to remember to do that are more important than sex"". "
"So this magical phrase is used by multiple men, I see. 

‚ÄúIf you want me to do it, tell me‚Äù....
Who told you to do it before I was here? 
Did you sit in dirty clothes, shit, dust, and dirt constantly? 

It‚Äôs such a turn off. I have two children to constantly ‚Äútell what to do‚Äù and I will not have a third. 

Men‚Äôs biggest complaint is usually sex or lack thereof. 

You want me to be your mommy and then blow you at the end of the day? Negative, ghost rider. "
"I want him to ask me how my day was and sincerely listen to my answer rather than just rant about all the difficult parts of his day at me the second he sees me. I‚Äôd like him to walk in, hang up his coat, say hello, give me a kiss, ask how my day was. 
It would be nice if he spent less time on his phone. He seriously looks at this phone half the day and then wonders why he never has any battery. 
Also I wish I could tell him these things without him feeling so crushed. He really cannot accept the slightest amount of criticism and it makes it hard to ask for what I need. I wish he knew that just because something he does bugs me a little doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt adore him with all my heart, just that I wish he would make an effort. 

Oh and my god he needs to clean more. Like for real. Clean up. I can‚Äôt be the only one who cleans. "
"They are all damaged goods in one way or another because I myself am damaged goods and attract it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently in therapy to work on my shit. So I stay single for now. "
"It‚Äôs completely normal to feel this way! 
I‚Äôm a postpartum doula/ career nanny and everything I‚Äôve ever heard from new moms supports this. Some women feel an immediate connection- but just because it was inside you for 9months doesn‚Äôt mean this tiny person isn‚Äôt a COMPLETE STRANGER. It takes time to love anything, your own baby is no different. "
"See, I'm the exact opposite. While my husband doesn't give me presents as signs of affection he does do a lot of touching, love yous, little ""mmms"" when I touch him, etc. But we haven't had sex in months."
"10 years married. Very much in love, 2 kids, sex life is back to normal, generally things are pretty good, but:

Holy shit, please fucking take me out on a date. Plan it YOURSELF, dress up for it, get stoked for it, and continue to BE stoked for it when the actual day comes. NO complaining about feeling uncomfortable in your clothes, no complaining about how expensive the fucking restaurant is or how much ""this whole production"" is going to cost, no bitching about the bullshit Seattle traffic. Just fucking sit with me and enjoy my company like I ALREADY KNOW YOU FUCKING DO in an outfit and setting other than PJs at home. Please? I miss spending time with you without our kids."
"Postpartum depression contributes to this, as well as unrealistic expectations that mothers have some magical ability to call on some vast reserve of unconditional love for this new tiny tyrant you just met, who demands all your energy and resources, and only ever complains.

If you‚Äôre a new parent, adjust your expectations. There‚Äôs no instinct. You have a job to do, and it takes time to get to know this little person, while healing your body and surviving depression. Focus on being kind and gentle, to yourself and to the baby. After a few months, the baby will start to respond to the kindness and gentleness, and they may grow on you.

Also, caring for a baby requires a lot of cuddling, and the cuddling will trigger oxytocin release, which also helps. "
"Not dated per se, but I tend to be attracted to tall, lanky, quiet/calm but goofy guys. I have a very big and loud personality so I think I need someone who can calm me down a little lol. "
Stop waiting until 'later' to do things. I end up picking up the slack and he inevitably says he was going to 'do that later'.
"I used to go-go dance for small, local music events. I knew my family would give me hell for it so I had a fake name and everything. Oddly enough it still felt like the most liberating thing I did. People saw me so differently when dancing on a stage. It felt like my truest self. I hid it because I knew no one in my life would be okay with it, which makes me sad."
"Be willing to come and do fun things with me and our two boys. He doesn't like being outdoors, and he stresses about being in what he calls an ""environment he can't control"" with the kids. So he never comes with us to the park, the beach, the pool, theme parks, basically anything that is not a mall (and even going to the mall is stressful). The extent of outing that he is willing to do most days is take us to the drive-thru... I have stopped trying to make him do things with us, because it just turns into a stressful outing and not fun at all, but it makes me sad that all these ""family outings"" are just me and the kids, and it makes me jealous to see other families doing things together. "
Mom of elementary age kids checking in. We‚Äôre pretty sure you have a double life. We‚Äôre just hoping that you don‚Äôt judge us for whatever crazy things our kids might say while in your care. 
They all have low standardsüëç
"With my first child I was expecting it to be a movie. They would hand me the baby and I would feel this ""glow"" of love.

That's a damn movie. It is not real life. In real life, after giving birth,  if you didn't have an epidural, you're basically in a form of shock, IMO. 

You're dehydrated because they won't let you drink fluids while in labor in case they do a last minute C-section, so you've gone probably at least 8 hours only getting ice chips. (For longer labors I guess they give you an IV to prevent dehydration?)

Your blood sugar is low because you haven't been able to eat anything for the duration of labor!

You're exhausted because it is physical exertion to give birth. It's hard work. You're tired. 

You're probably surrounded by mostly strangers. You know you're doctor, but all the nurses are strangers. 

You know the overwhelming feeling I had after the birth of my first child? I was tired and I very much wanted everyone to finish their work on my body so I could get some SLEEP!

When they handed me my baby, I was overwhelmed at how tiny her hands and feet were, how LOUD she was as a crier, how she sounded mad, and I mostly felt scared and nervous, wondering, ""How am I going to do this - raise this child?""

You'll notice I was thinking, ""How am I going to do this?"", not ""How are WE got to do this?"" because even though I was married, having my ex-husband around was like having another child in the room. Right from the start is was made clear to me that raising the kids was primarily my job - not his. He had a ""real"" job.

Later on, after I got to know my baby's cries, I realized that I was right - she was really MAD once she was out. Well, who wouldn't be? Everything was nice and warm inside, then your head gets squeezed thru a tunnel, and then you're out and people are grabbing you, wiping crud off of you, wrapping you in a scratchy blanket, and expecting you to DO stuff. ""When I was in that womb I didn't have to do a damn thing! Life was good.""

Babies are strangers. You do have to get to know them. I think you CAN fall in love with your babies while they are in utero, but that's all a fantasy kind of love.  You have to get to know them and appreciate them for all the wonderful things they are. 

Maybe it's like there's different levels of love, and the love you first feel for your baby is like Level 1? Then, it grows over time. 

I have heard that's how happy couples are too - their love grows over time. That's what I've heard. 

"
"&gt; Yes, it took me a good 3 months to start to feel anything, and 5 months before I really loved him and enjoyed him. 

i've heard that many parents have the same experience! i remember a study that said we might be wired to not find babies less than 6 months as cute/lovable, because it would make it easier to cope with loss. once a baby reaches that 6 month mark and shows the signs of health (rosy fat cheeks, big eyes), that's when many parents say they begin to feel that intense love and baby craziness they were supposed to feel from the start :)"
"It took a long time for me to really feel a bond. Like, not until she was older and really becoming a person. I took care of her, she was clean, fed etc but I wasn't a good parent emotionally. I did not enjoy her as a baby or toddler. I feel a lot of guilt and shame. I wish I could go back and redo her baby and toddler years."
"As a married man, and compared to the r/AskMen\-post, the answers here depresses me. I though we'd come further than men not making dinner, doing the dishes, cleaning up after them selves and generally taking care of the house hold."
"Well.. I catfished my friend's ex once. Not for money or anything, just for shits, giggles, and malice. My friend fully knew and received full documentation of the whole shebang. He was a shitty guy who talked at her like she was an inanimate object and didnt give a shit about anything she cared about, he just wanted someone to constantly listen to him and validate him without having to do the same for them. they were on and off quite a bit because she had convinced herself she couldnt do any better. One of the times they were off, for good we thought, we found out through the grapevine that he had fully set himself up on tinder in less than 24hrs, despite not even having an account before. We thought it was despicable, and joked about how we hoped he got catfished

I realized... I could make it happen

So I did. A week of rattling his chain via a fake tinder, fake facebook, fake kik, and a fake number (the burner app was having a 1 week free trial lmao). Ultimately he started treated this new fake girl just as shittily despite them never having met, so she told him to fuck off, the day before my burner free trial expired. I did, however, get a very pathetic message to her fake kik about a month later trying to crawl back to her... hours after he had tried to crawl back to my friend and was rejected. I dont know if he ever realized he was catfished because he's a fucking moron and I never bothered to delete any of the fakes"
"They tend to be ""man-quirky"" (which I'm realizing know is just a nicer word for ""possibly on the spectrum"", slow/hard to open up, bull headed lone wolves.  


Also, all skinny, all very defined bone structure, smart, all tech savvy, mostly brunettes."
"I'm super active in fandom. I have my fandom identity and my real life identity. Some days I spend more time logged on and chatting/writing/hanging out in my fandom identity than my real one. 

As I've aged, I've introduced people like my husband, close friends and family to my fandom identity but for decades it felt like the lines would never blur. "
"I lived a double life when I was 17. I met someone at my work who was 22 and we hit it off. Where I live, it was illegal for us to be intimate before I was 18, plus my dad was a cop. So until I turned 18, I pretended that I wasn‚Äôt seeing anyone and anytime I left the house to go see him, I‚Äôd tell them I was going somewhere else. 
It‚Äôs a long story but basically this involved me leaving my phone in places (It was tracked by my parents at all times) and leaving my car in places (my dad‚Äôs cop friends used to tell him where they saw it). At the time, the situation was pretty stressful cause I always had to lie to my parents and do some sneaky things but it was worth it. He‚Äôs still the love of my life, but all the stress was worth it. My parents adore him now too. "
"Seriously dude. 

Not trying to blow my own horn or anything, but my wife and her friends talk about how I‚Äôm ‚Äúa catch‚Äù etc. because I do basic things like cooking, cleaning, my own laundry, etc. 

Then I see the answers in this thread and see the basic ass things that other guys apparently aren‚Äôt doing and I‚Äôm kinda shocked...  this isn‚Äôt the fifties, it shouldn‚Äôt be some big thing for a dude to cook a meal for his wife, or to clean something. 

Seriously my fellow guys - step the hell up. She‚Äôs your wife, not your maintenance staff. "
I'd probably just tell her how much I love her and explain why baths are sometimes necessary 
"Wow! Thanks for sharing this. 

I'm really glad you are seeking help and better times lie ahead for you. I'm also happy you realized where the problem was and actively sought to correct it ."
"Hard

It wasn't safe to be honestly gay"
"Oh my God this. 

My SO will empty the dishwasher and put, like, a cookie sheet stacked on top of bowls in the cupboard, because ""why does it matter?"" Ffs"
I had fantasies of giving my youngest up for adoption when he was a baby. He screamed almost nonstop for 8 months straight. Around 8-9 months he chilled out a bit and I finally started to bond with him. I‚Äôm glad I stuck it out. He‚Äôs 11.5 now and a fucking amazing human who is going to do great things. He‚Äôs still an emotional basket case but smart as hell and a creative genius. I love that kid like crazy. 
"Yo word. It's like just cuz I wear black and have hand tattoos and play clarinet I'm a main character now and need to awaken their sense of adventure and whimsy. No, bro, I'm just a lady who likes sweaters. I still work 9-5. "
That‚Äôs very upsetting. He should try therapy if he‚Äôs open to it. Sounds like some major anxiety.
This exactly. It‚Äôs hard to feel sexy about a person you have to boss around. 
"I‚Äôm 21 years old living a double life. I was born in an Arab muslim family. With my family i have to pretend to be muslim, i have to lie about where I‚Äôm going or who I‚Äôm going with, i have to lie about praying and fasting, basically i have to lie about...everything. Because if they knew I‚Äôm no longer a muslim and i have a boyfriend, i drink, have tattoos, don‚Äôt wear a hijab...etc they‚Äôd literally kill me. 
Honestly, I‚Äôm so tired of living like this. I had moments where i was so close to exposing myself to my parents.
You‚Äôd say move out, well I can‚Äôt. Because, again, my family is ARAB and MUSLIM! "
"I've always dated shorter, skinnier guys. Close to my size really. And they always had this awful Napoleon complex that mainifeted itself into a really scary narcissistic personality once I got to know them better. But the guy I'm dating now (and honestly want to be with forever) is tall, double my size in weight (kinda built, but also kind of a dad bod in the sexiest way lol), and honestly the sweetest most caring man I've ever known. My god, I love the man more than anything I ever have loved in my life. "
"This. I'd have to have him kidnapped and dragged to the doctor to get him to go. 

But also, he gets blown off by doctors a lot too. They don't listen when he describes issues he's having and tell him to live with it. It sucks so I get why he doesn't want to go. "
"Treat anything that isn't an enthusiastic yes as a no. If she doesn't seem really into whatever it is you're doing, stop. Pay attention to body language, tone, etc. "
"Asian women in the navy. I‚Äôm white and anti-military, so I have *no idea* where this trend came from. I just date women on Tinder who aren‚Äôt unicorn hunting, and I guess they‚Äôre all Asian women in the navy where I live?"
My bf gets completely undressed in our living room. The couch is his hamper üò©
They had great taste in women.
"honestly, the majority have been significantly worse looking than me. i was told growing up that it was wise to choose an ugly man who would be grateful to have a wife better looking than himself, but that never materialized. if anything, their egos got so inflated that they wondered if they could do even better. and then i stuck around for longer than i should have, wondering what about me was so horrible that they'd keep a foot out the door.

thank god i screwed my head on straight, stopped this weird inverted narcissistic partner selection, and my now husband was the combo breaker. "
"Once my boyfriend cut of the tip of his finger with a very sharp knife. It bled and bled forever and would not stop. After about 45 minutes I told him we needed to go to the ER. And he refused and refused (in his defense he had no health insurance).

After calling his brother, who is a doctor, he hangs up and looks at me dead serious. ‚ÄúCan you google how to cauterize yourself?‚Äù I said NOPE GET IN THE CAR. I told him I‚Äôd pay his bills and we are not attempting to cauterize his finger ourselves! Which wouldn‚Äôt have worked anyways. Omg. "
"Yes! I listen to him while he talks for hours about his projects, friends, or that series he is watching. Even if I have absolutely no clue what is going on, I make an effort to pay attention and be interested. 

But he absolutely does not do the same for me. When I try to talk about something Im interested in, I get a  blank 'hmm' in response. It's like my interests dont really matter as much as his do. "
"You should send him that emotional labour comic that is very popular. If he is a fantastic husband, I'm sure he has no idea what he is doing is wrong. It might help open his eyes. Or at the very least, if he struggles changing, it might at least help him notice and appreciate that you take on that burden."
"Did that. Ended up dealing with shit and getting engaged to a sane, kind, functional adult within 3 years. 

Also he has a great butt"
"I‚Äôd ask if anything hurts‚Äîteeth or tummy or anything , tell me so I can get it fixed."
"&gt;I wish he would just look around and see what needs to be done and do it so I don‚Äôt have the mental load of tracking and managing all 4 of our lives plus our house.

I hear this so often about guys (and I know the feel as well) that I really wonder how this is such a general complaint. Do men actually see a very different reality? Do they literally, physically, NOT see clutter, or dishes, or the cat‚Äôs dirty litterbox? I‚Äôm really trying to understand, but I just can‚Äôt!"
"That I'm the reason I'm fat. 

Not genetics or poor health. Like. Just me overeating. "
same. tons of affection no sex. 
Spend more time with me and his daughter üòî
"I'm curious how much of an overlap there is in these threads. Like are the men that were saying they don't get enough affection, the same ones who's female counterparts are on this thread saying men don't make dinner/clean up?
I know I would have a hard time showing affection to someone I had to treat more like a child then a husband.

Just curious. Either way, reading these threads back to back was interesting"
"Thank you for putting this so succinctly, I've found this is me too. "
Fresh bread
"The best analogy I've heard for this phenomenon goes along the lines of, ""If you act like a toddler, you inevitably get the sex life of one"". It's exhausting picking up after another human all the time. A little bit of mindfulness and emotional labor go a long way into fuelling sexy times."
"I'm no longer friends with any guys who make me uncomfortable, but I used to have a friend in high school who would make it very clear like ""we're friends but I would totally fuck you"". And that was like...pretty much every girl he met. So just like the subtle and not-so-subtle hints of ""just say the word and I will immediately have sex with you even though we're not even very close"" wasn't great."
You are such a good mom.  Good for you for doing what needed to be done.
I‚Äôm the only one who cooks in my marriage despite us both working full time jobs. It‚Äôs infuriating. 
"I felt instant, overwhelming love for mine, so I can‚Äôt relate to your situation, but I wanted to say I consider what you did heroic. Caring for an infant and toddler is unbelievably difficult and emotionally draining even when you love them with all your heart. To have done so out of duty and responsibility only is an incredible thing. No one is a perfect parent, and I‚Äôm not even a little surprised that in the face of all those overwhelming responsibilities, you didn‚Äôt have the strength to fake an emotional attachment on top of that. You can‚Äôt help how you feel and you can‚Äôt change the past. Forgive yourself and acknowledge that you did an amazing thing in the face of a terribly burdensome situation. "
"In HS, I had everyone in my family convinced that I was a perfect kid. I never stayed out late despite not having a curfew, I respected my parents and myself. No one had any idea that I regularly drank and had unprotected sex with my boyfriend (now husband). I'd sneak out almost nightly and just do really stupid things. 

When my parents would frustrate me, I would never mouth off or anything. I would just wait till that night and sneak out, get plastered and do sexual things I'd never do while sober. "
"I don't like when a movie or show features lots of female leads that it gets turned into a feminist movie or show. Can't a show have women in it and just be a show? 

And it backfires too often. I've heard people call Jessica Jones ""too feminist."" Jessica is an alcoholic, PTSD suffering, asshole. She's mean to people often, regardless of gender. She's not mean to people because she's a feminist. She's mean because she has issues."
"Living double life here. Last week I decided, I‚Äôm sick of being a poor student, and started escorting for money. Wasn‚Äôt sure how I would feel. Mostly I hate it and feel numb. Part time work at a law firm by day, and escort at night. 

Also drug recovery. I‚Äôm like the poster girl in my town for drug recovery (meth). I do public speaking all over the country. Little does anyone know I‚Äôm not 3 years clean, I went on a bender over New Years and I loved (almost) every minute of it. Plan to do it next year too. I don‚Äôt know what I am doing with my life anymore. I feel like I am just waiting for it to be over. "
"Spend a bit more money on himself.  He buys me a lot of little gifts and I love them all but I wish he would take a little of that money and treat himself.  I literally have to force him to buy things like new socks and undies because he just does not like to spend money on himself, even if it's my money. "

"Picture a pile of someone else‚Äôs clutter. It‚Äôs not nice to look at, but you don‚Äôt worry about it because you know it‚Äôs not your responsibility to put away. That‚Äôs how they see a ton of the chores. ‚ÄúOh, someone else does that.‚Äù

This was made very clear to me, and I have to untrain him to see things that way. When we‚Äôre both cleaning, he‚Äôll be picking up clutter and put my stuff in a pile. I don‚Äôt mind that concept, but I‚Äôd find stuff in the pile that is very clearly both of ours. Those aspirin are not *mine*, those cat toys are not *mine*, that piece of garbage is not *mine*! He was basically assuming that anything that he didn‚Äôt know where to put (or didn‚Äôt think hard about knowing where to put) was mine and I could take care of it.

It‚Äôs taken a lot of repetition to emphasize that he needs to know where things go, and if we‚Äôre splitting chores and he‚Äôs picking up clutter, he should be putting my things away too, because it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm only washing the dishes I used or cooking single portions of food for myself.

He‚Äôs gotten a lot better and now he‚Äôs more likely to say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm putting your ____ over here.‚Äù"

"I‚Äôve always wanted flowers but I‚Äôve finally realized, flowers don‚Äôt mean to my husband what they mean to me. So to him if he‚Äôs going to get me something special, he gets what to him is special, which I also do when I get him gifts.

So I started to question myself, why do I wait for someone to buy me flowers when I can get them myself, pick out something sweet and special myself? So I do :) I treat myself to flowers when I want them. And when I go to my girlfriends‚Äô homes I buy them flowers too bc I know their men don‚Äôt give a crap about flowers. It‚Äôs become a thing for me to buy my best girlfriends and me flowers :) "
"I feel this so hard. I shower at night and he showers in the morning. So every morning while he showers, I wake up and make him breakfast (just a toasted English muffin, but still), put everything in his lunchbox (more on this later), and make him tea or coffee. All while helping an eye on the cats (our kitten likes to play wrestle our senior cat who cannot handle it). Then we both get dressed and head out the door at the same time.

We both get home at roughly the same time, but he usually gets home earlier. I cook dinner almost every night (though he's been cooking more since I got mad. Again, more on this later), and he does the dishes. So like.. fair. But if he gets home before me, I have to specifically ask him if he can get started on things because he won't do it without me asking. If I don't ask, I'll have to do everything myself and dinner will be late.

I've been on him a lot lately about trying to help with dinner and especially about making sure he makes his sandwiches for lunch the night before. Because he did it when we first moved in together and if he forgot, I'd do it in the morning. No biggie if it was once every now and again. But at some point it got to the point where he didn't even try to remember to do it at night and one day I just lost it because I was so freaking overwhelmed. I was like ""Dude, I cannot make every single meal for both of us every single day. We work the same hours. Fucking do something."" It's gotten a lot better since then, but sometimes I still get annoyed. Lol"
"I mean, that's badass "

"Lol, I'm a seasoned Nanny.

On one of my first days, the kids were happily chatting away in the backseat on the way home from school, when the 5YO boy (the oldest) in my care directly blurted out...

""MY DADDY HAS A HUGE BUMP ON HIS PENIS THAT THE DOCTOR HAD TO POKE WITH A NEEDLE""

The car went silent. And it was silent the rest of the way home. I was appalled and had no earthly idea how to respond to it.

The worst part was speaking with the dad that afternoon, reviewing the kid's behavior, etc... and all I can think about is his boil-ridden dick and how mortified he would be if he knew what I now knew.

I'm assuming they took a shower together or something and the kid saw it. Who knows,

But very well put. Kids tell ALL. Lol. "
"They all of them love The National and _all_ of them thought Boxer was their best album.

Luckily I love the national too. "

"I wish he'd take care of things every time he said he was going to take care of them. I worry about things and it would be so much easier if he would just do what he says he's going to do. There's always some reason as to why he was going to look into it, but it's always an excuse. It's a big turn off and it just makes me worry more. 

Money has been a little tight lately and he gets his xbox membership renewed yearly as well as his EA subscription on xbox. I asked him to make sure it wouldn't do that because we're a little tight on money.

He didn't do it. Both things renewed (on separate days) and he ""thought he did it"" and ""didn't know it was going to renew this month"".

"Up until the guy I'm dating now, they were all very insecure. I'm glad I've broken out of that one!"
"I‚Äôm in the same exact boat. Overall a happy marriage, and he‚Äôs truly a wonderful human being, but the lack of this really hurts. I have to lay it out in black and white for him on these types of occasions and even then he fails to meet it. I keep trying to tell him he doesn‚Äôt have to read my mind, just write down the basics I‚Äôm looking for. Example: anniversary was last weekend - asked for 6 o‚Äôclock reservations at restaurant in our neighborhood I‚Äôve been wanting to try, a card with sweet written message, and bouquet of $10 grocery store flowers... Well, I got the reservation for dinner but that was it. 
He keeps bringing up how great his birthday was this past year. I surprised him with a weekend trip to a national park and a birthday present I knew he wanted but didn‚Äôt specifically ask for. Whenever he brings up his birthday experience I tell him to use that as an example of what to do in return for me. Guess I‚Äôll just have to wait and see. "
LOL absolutely not!! We‚Äôre just as afraid of what they tell you!
"Hey, I have some of the feelings you describe your husband having. I‚Äôm an introvert and loud, chaotic, unfamiliar places stress me out. Travel used to be a nightmare, but with the help of my wife and just plain practice I got better. Here are a few thing that help me out a lot:

* I hate driving in traffic, so my wife primarily takes this. Part of this is parking in cities you never know when you‚Äôll actually be able to stop and park, because parking spaces get so uncertain.
* I get stressed by spending money I didn‚Äôt know I was going to have to spend. This has been alleviated partly but just getting into a better financial situation, but also just allocating a budget during outings to unknown expenses and assuming it‚Äôs just gone. Relating to the above, I just always assume we‚Äôll have to pay for parking.
* Knowing where I can take a break. (And actually let me take a break if I need to) Especially right when we arrive, I want to be able to sit down somewhere and just look around, be not bothered for 5 mins before really launching into the activity. Must be out of the flow of people, better if quiet and there‚Äôs food/water/bathrooms immediately available.
* I bring a backpack everywhere. I have a man purse and I love it. It helps maintain the control. I‚Äôll frequently have a snack, water, phone charging cable and an extra battery, headphones, tissues, and just space for carrying things. My wife didn‚Äôt like me carrying a some places at first because SHE wouldn‚Äôt enjoy carrying it, but realized I was dealing with it and not putting that on her. And I once used items in my bag to McGyvered a hook and line to fish a camera out of a weird space she had dropped it in the monorail at Disneyland. She hasn‚Äôt complained about my bag since.
* This is a weird one. I hated travel, but my wife and I both play Magic the Gathering. So we started traveling to tournaments in different places. This was largely cheating my anxieties because the city would change (Which my wife loved) but the tournament would more or less work the same way no matter where we were. We could go there first and I‚Äôd get the familiar pattern, then we could branch off and go do something new and she got her novelty. This is how I got my practice in that really distressed travel a lot. I mention it in case it can help anyone, but I know it‚Äôs fairly unique so I don‚Äôt have a good suggestion how to replicate it, sorry.

I don‚Äôt know if any of that will help you. I know this dealing with this is a pain and I‚Äôm sorry. I, at least, try to not have it affect my wife whenever possible. I don‚Äôt know if it will help you feel better to hear this, but I can assure you it is a pain for us as well, we certainly wouldn‚Äôt choose to feel this way if we had a choice.

Good luck!"
Then they're a lot hotter than I imagine them.
"Look up the C25K program or the Run-Walk-Run program.     
Each of these takes you from walking to running over the course of several weeks.     
In the beginning it's important to establish good habits so you don't hurt yourself- a bit of reading on /r/running and browsing a few youtube offerings about proper form will set you right up.    
Shoes are important- again the repetitive pounding can cause you problems if your footwear isn't up to speed.   

As far as embarrassment- leave the house, do brisk walking long enough to warm up, then gentle yourself into a run. It is still just as much fun as it was in your childhood.   
Honestly- any time I see *anyone* out there either walking *or*  running my only thought is ""Good for them."" Never do I ever think they look ridiculous.   
Most people are far too wrapped up in their own lives to worry about yours.  

And like I said it makes you feel so good that you won't care if you get glanced at.  
It is very empowering."

"I'm mostly the same person. My real life and fandom personalities are the same. 

However, when someone asks me if I've seen a specific movie or book, in fandom my answer will be like this: ""Have I *seen* it? I watched/read it 5 times this year alone. Heres a link to my fanfiction, heres a link to my fic recs. Also watch these fanvids. Let me know if you want to chat about this media for years. Should we make a discord server?""

We all do some fucked up shit that harms us and that varies from person to person. Call me a reckless optimist, but I still believe that something can be changed. If you ever need to talk to someone who's not involved in the situation, please, feel free to reach out! Lots of hugs. "
This! Also flowers for no reason. 
"Offer to help me before I have to ask for your help. If you see me cleaning or struggling with something, especially the kids, just help me. Don‚Äôt say ‚Äúall you have to do is ask for help‚Äù. No, I shouldn‚Äôt have to ask you to help with your kids. Just fucking do it. 

We also have our duties divided, like I get the kids ready for school and take them to school and he makes dinner and does bed time. Just fucking do what you‚Äôre supposed to do with out me telling you to do it. When you put the kids to bed at 9, they are miserable in the morning. 

So basically, just do what you are supposed to do with out the wife having to ask or tell you to do it. 

Also, if you will be late home from work, give the wife a heads up before you are actually late. "

"This might sound dumb but it worked for me, I'm forgetful. Especially if there is a significant amount of time between the idea and it's execution, or if it was something shared in passing. So I made a secret Pinterest board. If my wife shares a link, idea, or whatever I save it to that board. I keep an open note on my phone so if it's something she says verbally I'll jot it down and look for a specific link to pin later. Additionally a secret Amazon wish list is a good idea. It takes literally seconds to note things and about two weeks before and event I scroll through and pick through the ideas and items. Gift smarter not harder. "
"In the past 6 years I have experienced and been in many friendship groups mainly due to those I obtained from my relationships. I always learn so much about myself when being put in new friendships, so I know what my worth is and what I deserve. 

It‚Äôs very easy for me to cut friends off. 
Some of the reasons why included:

- lack of or non existing mutual appreciation and acknowledgment 
- being taken advantage of or being a push over 
- lack of open mindness (my way, or the highway) 
- lack of respect for those around them 
- discourage your beliefs, goals and perspectives 

It feels bittersweet to cut people off, but at the same time some what liberating. Encourages me to be a better person also! "

"I struggle with feminist retconning. Basically, disregarding women through history who made great strides in the feminist movement, but because their actions weren't in line with present day feminism, they suddenly ""weren't real feminists"". Like, no, they were, it's just that feminism evolved. That shouldn't diminish the contributions of those who came before us. We're all products of our times.

I also have difficulty with Trans issues. Not because I don't support the trans community, but because any time you seek information, you're written off as being transphobic for daring TO question. Like no, I actually want to be a better ally, but that's an experience I don't understand. I'm trying to.

Mostly I just avoid those dialogues now because it's earlier."
There's a name for this trope in movies and TV. Manic Pixie Dream Girl. Think Zooey Deschanel in 500 days of Summer and Ramona Flowers from Scott Pilgrim. 
"I have essentially drilled this thought process out of my guy friends since then but a common problem was them invalidating and/or oversimplifying issues women predominantly face. 

For example: I ranted to a group of four guy friends when I was late to meeting them about how I was late because a male coworker was making me uncomfortable (multiple red flags for months) and following me around so I had to wait half an hour after he left before I could go out to the dark parking structure alone to make sure he was gone. They were puzzled why I didn‚Äôt just tell him I wasn‚Äôt interested or that I had a girlfriend (true at the time) or lie and say I have a boyfriend. And INSISTED no matter how I explained the safety issues that I was unreasonable. "
"Oh, same. So often his problems are blown off as weight issues. He went in for treatment of a brown recluse bite once, and they tested him for diabetes. 

But I still wish he'd go. I suggest ways he can be a better advocate for himself when doctors pull that crap, but he'd prefer to just let things heal with time."
"You could always let them know this is an issue (if you haven't already), and set up a weekly meal schedule of who prepares what. If they don't agree then stop cooking for them. Make a meal for youself. You aren't responsible for babying an adult, but so many women feel like they have to fulfill this traditional gender role even when it makes them unhappy."
"A friend of mine is strongly encouraging me to loose my virginity, and while I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm very sex positive and I‚Äôm opposed to having sex, it‚Äôll just happen when it does. I‚Äôm not gonna go looking for some guy just so I can check this ridiculous thing off my list that I personally don‚Äôt even think is important at all. "
"I wish I knew what little attentions to do for him. I'm very vocal when I want things and he knows to get me flowers or my favorite chocolate when I have a crap day. But he's a very contented person, when I ask him if he needs anything he'll often say he's perfectly fine. I wish there was a fairly easy little thing I could do for him to raise his spirits a little when he has hard days. "
"This is exactly my mentality now. Not that there's a damn thing wrong with someone that doesn't have it all together, but I've worked my ass off over the years to get where I am in regards to my career and mental health, and it's nice to finally meet someone that has the same drive and dedication, and has something to show for it."

"Dude here, 
I always heard these stories about lives changing the moment thier child is born. For me, I felt nothing. Just a ""whoa"" that's a part of me? 

Then as we take her home, still, nothing , just a scared feeling of taking care of her. 

Then when it was just me and her at home, still nothing. But now, as I am the main care provider and the comfort she feels in my hands and the huge smiles and giggles she has only for me , her papa; have filled me the the brim with love and joy. I feel a hole in me if I don't hold her, kiss her little cheeks, and see her smile/giggle.

"This is exactly it. It sucks because everything else in the relationship is great, but I keep lamenting on this one thing. It hurts sometimes. It makes me feel two-dimensional, like my interests and hobbies don‚Äôt matter as much. "

"I didn‚Äôt bond with my first baby immediately. It was a very traumatic labour and my milk never came in so she was always hungry and crying. Neither of us got any sleep. It was hell. I wanted someone to take her away. I started bottle feeding which helped her eat and sleep better but I was a nervous wreck for several months. I had absolutely no maternal instincts. With hindsight I was probably more depressed than I realised but I thought it was just anxiety. Good news is we did bond, a slow process that started when she was around 2 weeks old. She‚Äôs 12 now and all is fine. I don‚Äôt feel bad or guilty for the rough start. I wasn‚Äôt well, I couldn‚Äôt help it and she was always completely looked after and safe. Women should know it‚Äôs not always a rosy start to motherhood but that it WILL be ok. 

I was nervous having my second baby but everything went differently. As soon as he was born I felt incredibly protective and maternal. I had instincts. I knew when he wasn‚Äôt well. My milk came in and I could feed him. I was like, ‚Äúis this what normally happens?!‚Äù It‚Äôs a good job I had that strong love immediately because he‚Äôs an incredibly challenging kid who tests my patience every day - we need that strong foundation lol!!  "
Sane and good butted is the dream.
"my oldest brother died when I was in the 5th grade. He was 31, died from heroin overdose. I was very young and there was a huge age difference between us meaning we weren‚Äôt very close or anything- I think the thing that effected me the most was how broken my parents were. I didn‚Äôt know it at the time but things in my household weren‚Äôt always the healthiest.. 

-my parents never talked about my brothers death. they never told us younger kids what happened or anything, never spoke of his name. So it was kind of a silent rule my whole life that we never brought him up. I regret that so much.

- my mom would go through some major depressive episodes, I mean who wouldn‚Äôt in her position. However she didn‚Äôt handle them properly. She was a secret alcoholic, hid it very well. She would cause random fights with my dad, my older siblings, occasionally us. A lot of yelling in my house, lack of emotional support. 

- my mom was distant from me and my 3 younger sibs. Maybe it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs scared to love her children after losing one? Depression? I‚Äôm sure a lot of things contribute to it but I always saw my friends and their moms being a lot closer than us.

Things progressively got better over the years. Of course there‚Äôs lingering trauma that won‚Äôt get dealt with because my parents don‚Äôt believe in therapy, 

When I was 16 my other older brother died of a heart attack at 31. This one was a lot harder for me, but I suppressed it all because I kept remembering how bad it was last time. 

So I took on the responsibility of being a 3rd parent in my house. My dad started coming to me for help when my mom kicked him out (I would sneak him back in). My little brother had absolutely no boundaries which made me worried ab him constantly. Eventually I developed responsibility OCD among other things and had a bad break down last year. I did therapy and talked ab all this lol. 

However my friends at school would have never known about any of that. Because of my parents lack of talking about feelings I never did either. I masked it by being an obnoxious attention seeking person- so loud and absurd all the time but everyone thought I was funny so I needed that in my life. "
They were all a lot less emotionally invested than I was. 
"This is the reason I won't have kids. My combination of anxiety and depression makes it really hard to feel love and affection. Some days my anxiety is so bad I even look at my own mother and feel like she's a stranger and have no sense of connection to her. It's really shitty and I hate it, but it's apparently how my brain works.

I'd never bring a kid into this world and have them be treated like that. It wouldn't be fair to anyone. "
I'd ask them what they enjoy most and tell them why I love them. I would inform them about the vet and baths. I would encourage them not to lick their siblings because it's causing bald spots. 
"I always thought it would be fun to be that doctor that tests urine for drugs.

Omg I literally just had this argument with my husband 30 minutes ago. And he said ‚Äújust tell me what you want me to do‚Äù! Ughhh.... I don‚Äôt want to have to be a manager in my own home. I don‚Äôt see how hard it is to realize the shelves need dusting or dishes to be put away. Why do I have to be the one to dictate all the orders? Why can‚Äôt I just come home and things are just being done?!
"Same lol. I‚Äôve noticed that when I‚Äôm attracted to a guy he‚Äôs almost always tall and lanky with brown hair, blue eyes and scruff. There was one day where I was like ‚Äú... all these guys look the same‚Äù haha. I‚Äôm the opposite of you though‚ÄîI‚Äôm very quiet and reserved, so I like dating really charismatic people with big personalities because they bring me out of my shell a little."

"They have depth. Which often coincides with some sort of present or past mental health issue, usually depression. Maybe it's cause I went through hell myself, so the only ones who I truly connect with are those who have walked through hell as well.

This was the case with both the guys I fell in love with. Both cases, it didn't turn out well. But if there isn't that sort of depth I have trouble connecting with them."
‚Äòthat‚Äôs gay‚Äô? are you dating a 12 year old?

"I‚Äôm a 23(f) who is currently living a double life. The reason to that is because I have a daughter. I broke up with her dad moved out because I had finally got the strength to leave him with  his Narcissistic family. Now my main concern is is her. I must not allow my dating and going out world with my family world which is 90% of the time.I feel like I cannot risk my daughter getting attached to someone and then having them to leave without her understanding why they left or why they disappeared so to avoid all of that and clarity I keep those two worlds separate.When I go out and whom ever I decide to go out with asked me if I have a child I say yes and then change immediately the subject because that becomes z private topic I have private. I never deny that I have a daughter I do show a picture here and there but that‚Äôs as close as those two worlds come together.

"Yep. My husband cheated on me and partially blamed it on me not giving him enough physical attention. He has always lived within 5 miles of his mommy and I ended up being mommy #2. It was the biggest libido killer ever. He literally acted like he was helpless in being an adult. I drove us everywhere, paid all the bills, did all the emotional support, went to dinner with his family every damn Sunday, and just had zero interest in sex with him after a while. 

You can‚Äôt act like a giant baby and then expect your wife to actually want to fuck you, dudes!! "
I hate to admit it but I would love a lazy desk job doing something where I can listen to music or audiobooks. 
"You know, the dance you do when you gotta potty"
"For the record, you can absolutely still end up in this situation without being married."
"I wish my husband would learn how to take care of his daughters. He spends time with them when can but has no idea how to take care of them. We have 3 girls and he still struggles to change a diaper.

Seeing him be a good father is a huge turn on for me, so I‚Äôd wish he‚Äôd do it more."
"Hi I‚Äôm a male. My friends and I watch MMA and when there‚Äôs a women‚Äôs fight they always root for the more attractive fighter. It‚Äôs uncomfortable because we will actually have intellectual conversations about technique, former fights etc. and then when it‚Äôs a women‚Äôs fight it becomes a beauty contest. Yeah just uncomfortable."
It‚Äôs actually soul sucking. Do not recommend. 
"So, I‚Äôm posting this from my ‚Äúother account‚Äù, because my identity is not disclosed on my other. Basically, in real life, I‚Äôm the ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù and happy-go-lucky girl. I‚Äôm awfully modest and everyone has seen me as the ‚Äúgoody two shoes‚Äù type. I teach and uphold a professional appearance. I started selling panties and camming a few years ago, when I was really tight on money. I ended because I was being blackmailed, but have started again recently now that I have found supportive subs on Reddit. The extra cash is nice, but honestly, I just love sexuality and I guess am a bit of an exhibitionist. I feel like there are girls you would expect to do these sort of things, but everyone would be so shocked to find out I post nudes online for strangers and they buy my panties. Part of me wishes it could just be normal and part of casual conversation, but I know I‚Äôll have to keep it a secret it forever. "
"I'm presently a stripper and it when I read stories like this, it reminds me that people still have the stupid in them to ask ""Why do you do this??"" 


Uh. Because I'd rather spend 7 hours a shift gaining independence and financial stability rather than spend 7 hours (or a lot more) slaving for an uncondiscending corporation. 


Big props for muscling through this line of work for the sake of your kids and sanity. "

"This. 1000x this. I'm so turned off at this point because I sometimes want affection that doesn't lead to fucking and no matter how many times we discuss this, it still doesn't happen. "
Spend less time in front of the computer. He would be able to more for himself without losing time behind the pc. 
Omg same. And it will stay there the whole week. I know this because I didn‚Äôt pick it up to see how long it would take for him to pick it up. I think if I hadn‚Äôt picked it up it would still be there today.

"I can relate to this, I‚Äôm Indian but raised in the states and it‚Äôs so hard sometimes because my mentality is so different/modern compared to my parents. It‚Äôs mental draining to pretend/hide big aspects of your life but I feel you, there‚Äôs no way to be open about it to your family :-( Lucky for me, my parents are okay with me moving out for work and stuff so maybe try that route? "
"That is so true. When I was around 35-36? Guys would point blank ask if had any other goals in life. With full sarcasm and eye roll.
I‚Äôd smile and ask them what they do? When they‚Äôd answer me, I‚Äôd smile again and ask when THEY would be doing something else? Complete with sarcasm and eye roll as well. 
Usually shuts them up. Try it next time one asks you. 

The best response to my attitude was a guy that laughed and said ‚Äútouch√©, that was a rude question from me. Apologies.‚Äù "

"I know we‚Äôre all looking for the typical answers like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fat or dumb or bad at math because of me‚Äù and like big mood haha 

but honestly the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever had to admit to myself is that I‚Äôm worthy of kindness and love and taking up space on this earth

I spent most of my life listening to that voice that makes us want to hate ourselves and trying to block out that voice and switch out negatives with positives is really hard 

This mindset is toxic in relationships too, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve never had a happy successful one. Who would want to love me if I think I‚Äôm the worst thing to ever happen?

So TLDR : the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever had to admit to myself is that I‚Äôm worthy of kindness and love and taking up space on this earth. Some days I still don‚Äôt believe it but it‚Äôs a work in progress "
"I don‚Äôt agree with choice feminism. While I strongly defend a woman‚Äôs right to determine for herself on any issue, not every choice is a ‚Äúfeminist‚Äù choice just because a woman makes it. Nothing happens in a vacuum, and some choices /do/ reinforce negative stereotypes and harm women. However, I defend a woman‚Äôs right to make these choices anyway, even if I don‚Äôt agree with them.

"Do not stay. I am recently single and have an 8 month old. In the beginning, I never thought I‚Äôd be able to do it all on my own. After some time went by, I realized I had already been doing it on my own. The only difference between back then and now is that I have the bed to myself and I am incredibly happy.The leap is scary, but it is worth it. "
"Yes, my trama was something I was trying to cover up for so long. But unpacking the baggage is the only way to move forward."
"My ex. His parents were VERY well off and older than average when he was born, so his mom and dad spoiled him like crazy. At 19-20 he was still receiving a $250 allowance  a week, plus additional spending money if needed throughout the week, he had never had a job for more than a few days and every two years his parents would buy him a brand new car which they of course would pay for any maintenance that needed to be done on said car. He would also throw tantrums when his parents didn't do things for him or didn't give him things that he wanted. It was ridiculous. When he and I started dating, I became pretty close with his mom, I learned so much about her and she learned a lot about me, like how I grew up in a pretty poor family, never got an allowance, started working at 14 and by the time I was a senior in high school I had a full time job, ect ect. I would help his mom, who was retired, with chores around their big house ect. Something that he NEVER did. One day, I was helping her rearrange their library, yes they had a library, and between huffs and puffs as we were moving furniture, she said to me, ""I know you will eventually realize that you are too good for my son, and I hope that when that day comes you and I will remain friends."" After I broke up with him a few months later, her and I would secretly meet for lunch and after about a year she told me that her husband and her had been fighting a lot over how spoiled their son, my ex, was. She wanted to cut the cord and his dad didn't. It got so bad that they were even talking about divorcing. I lost touch with her over the years, but I do know that their son, who is now 30, still lives at home and is STILL getting new cars from them, only he makes it seem like he's buying them himself. "
"They do but it's not 'their job' to know what to do with that mess/laundry pile/children's toys. After all, you do the laundry and cook and look after the kids, what if through trying to help he messes it all up? Better to just stand back and let you deal with it while you tell him what bits to do. As opposed to you know...making task xyz his priority as well. "
My best friend when I was very young was like this. She was a pathological liar bc her home was so messed up. If I had gotten some cash in the mail for my birthday she would steal it. Eventually she got taken away by foster care and left a note saying goodbye with the money she took. I always wonder what happened to her and her sisters. 
"Interesting, but don‚Äôt you think there will be lies that you‚Äôll have to continue backing up forever? I imagine the story of how you two met was altered. And also, that your parents aren‚Äôt aware of your couple‚Äôs anniversary and so on."
"my sister had a string of marriages like this. she was abused in all of them. men who batter are usually very big on getting you committed early and causing a whirlwind, both because it hooks you and because he himself thinks he's found the perfect partner and has you so high up on a pedestal that you're certain to fall."
"I have a super helicopter mom who would continuously invade my privacy and slut shame me if she thought I liked someone or found out I was dating someone. It was bad enough that I would get beaten up if she found out I was dating someone.

So at home, I would pretend that I was not dating anybody and had to hide everything related to my SO. "
Yep. It took me a while to form a connection with my kids. It became easier when they could respond to me and it felt less like a baby doll that constantly cried
"Excluding my husband, they were all men I wanted to help. They all had some deeper sadness and I wanted to help alleviate it. It ended up hurting me more than helping them, though two of them are doing well now. It brings me deep relief to see them every now and then on Instagram either traveling or making music. "
I don‚Äôt know any mothers who laugh at messes their children make and then clean it up like it‚Äôs the most fun they‚Äôve had since making the kid 
"Currently living in NE, always date a guy who likes hiking. Because then he takes you hiking"
Husband and I read the love language book and identified which ones we are. I am physical touch (he is acts of service) and now he knows that makes me feel the most loved so he makes sure to make an effort.

"Use the proper words for when he plans to do something. For example, currently him saying he'll do it ""right now"" could mean anywhere between 10 minutes from now to several hours from now; perhaps even longer if he forgets about it. I'd even be okay with something super vague like ""I'll get it done today"", or ""sometime this afternoon"". I don't care. Just not the words you'd usually use to mean doing something soon being used to mean anything between soon and a few days' time."
I hope now you are surrounded by people who love and accept you as your true self. 
"I lived a double life on a sugar baby site.. I honestly made an account for fun with a friend and I thought I could make a little bit of money in the side. I was in a really hard part of my life. Not that this makes it right, but I had a really low self esteem and thought very little of myself as a whole. I didn‚Äôt realize how degrading it would be over time. I catfished a lot of men on the site.. one actually was very sweet and wanted to send me $5000. Before he sent it I felt so guilty for lying that I admitted I wasn‚Äôt who I had been acting like for months, and came clean. I apologized and blocked him on everything.

Crazy twist to the story.. when I told my friend who started the account with me, she was so mad I didn‚Äôt take the money. She said she would have and asked me to accept it and give it to her. Obviously I said no.. anyways I found out about a year later that she had made an account and started talking to the same man I was. We stopped being friends after the whole ordeal but she actually told him my real name to spite me.. he ended up finding my actual account on Facebook and messaged me asking if I knew my friend was a fraud. I never answered but he said she cheated him out of $30,000. I never knew whether or not to believe him but I didn‚Äôt answer and blocked him on everything because I was worried it was literal fraud and didn‚Äôt want to be associated with it. 

I‚Äôm sure there are a lot of people who think they could just accept money for pictures or whatnot, and I truly thought I would too. But I felt like the most disgusting human on the planet.. and I‚Äôm so glad I found myself shortly after the entire incident. Couldn‚Äôt imagine living my life the way I did before. It‚Äôs really hard relying on other people to tell you how beautiful you are etc. Just to feel whole.. especially when it truly isn‚Äôt you. "
"Stop making everything a big deal. Yes, I know I was playing with the cat. Yes, I know the cat ran head first into his water bowl and spilled water everywhere. But water can be cleaned. It's really not a problem. Do you absolutely have to pitch a fit? 

I love the man but his fuse is a fraction the length of mine. Just the smallest things tend to set him off. "
If you have a full time job you don't have more time than him to be making the meals all the time.  There's no excuse for him not to grow up and cook himself something or for you especially.  
"I had a similar experience - my third child was born just shy of a year after my daughter was stillborn. I was still pretty traumatized, and I basically just spent the entire pregnancy pretending it wasn't happening. I figured once he came out I'd feel relieved and love him, but it was basically just like, ""Oh. A baby."" It took me about a year to fully bond with him. I honestly don't remember much of his infancy. I felt guilty because with my first kid I'd had that magical insta-love bonding, but with his brother I was basically just going through the motions. I actually posted about it in a parenting subreddit at one point, and someone told me to do a little exercise where I just stared at him while he was sleeping and visualized beaming love from me to him, opening myself up. It sounds corny but it really worked, and I found myself just breaking down and sobbing. It didn't instantly ""fix"" me, but it allowed me to realize that I DID love him, that it was there inside of me, and that I just needed to let myself feel it. So I just continued doing that. Now he's 5 and I love him every bit as much as my firstborn. "
Be ugly
I'd listen to whatever she could cram into those five mins.
"If you read the above comment, they mentioned they dated *several* short dudes, and eventually it was their personality that turned her off. Let that sink in. "
"Not married but close to it ‚Äî I wish he would exercise more, and this doesn‚Äôt mean he has to go all out at the gym but enough to maintain his health. He‚Äôs almost 10 years older than I am and he doesn‚Äôt work out anymore, and I am just worried about his health in the future. I want to be able to have kids with him and he can keep up and remain active like I want our future family to be. He at least doesn‚Äôt eat poorly and has a decent diet.

I wish he would ask me about my day sooner. I don‚Äôt like just telling him right away how my day was unprompted, and I always am the one to ask him how his day was over dinner (if not earlier). It‚Äôs usually not until much much later that he asks, and then when I‚Äôm discussing, sometimes he will think he‚Äôs supporting my conversation but really he details and starts telling me a story that is unrelated to what I‚Äôm saying and it takes about 20 minutes for us to get back to what I was saying. I certainly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs out of malice, he just likes to talk a lot. "
Cuddles after sex
I give him massages when he‚Äôs really stressed with a happy ending. It be nice to get one in return every once in a while without having to ask for it.
"I told my ex this, too -- he finally bought me a peace lily plant, which is what I got every time someone died, and I hate those things. He knew I loved roses, why not a rose bush? The peace lily is when I knew he really never listened to me."
The same thing happened to me with my oldest. I understand exactly how you feel. It is my biggest regret and the guilt/shame I feel is crippling sometimes. I just wanted you to know you aren't alone. 
"My most successful relationships have been with tall and glasses-wearing, soft-spoken men. My boyfriend maintains that type as a glasses-wearing gentle giant."
"I feel like part of feminism that tends to get overlooked or that tends to get thrown away sometimes is that we're supposed to encourage each other to follow our own plans and desires.  Like, a woman who loves children and wants to devote her life to raising her own is making the same kind of decision as a woman who loves business and wants to run a fortune 500 company.  We should respect both decisions, because it means both women are following their own personal desires and doing what they want to do with their lives.

A woman that enjoys sex and has many partners versus a woman who prefers to only have sex with someone they feel a special connection (or doesn't feel ready to have sex for whatever reason) should both be considered sex positive and should both be supported.  They're both making an active decision about how they want to engage in sex, and we should respect those decisions.

I think your friend needs to recognize that you're making an active decision about your sex life, a very feminist thing to do, and even though it isn't the same decision that she would make, she should respect your decision."

"Not to answer for her but it might be the lack of sharing. Women are sharers! But some of us are more aloof and private, and maybe have a busy life. So we are naturally less emotionally or physically needy. This has led a few men to think I was mysterious and fascinating.

I am neither, probably. I just don‚Äôt share as much with them as maybe they‚Äôre used to. "
"Why won‚Äôt you return him a favour and buy nice things, if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?"
"I'd like to be sympathetic to your husband but this sounds like he is just avoiding parenting. Does he get time alone when you all go out? That may be what he is looking for, which is fine if it's okay with you but it doesnt sound like it is okay with you."
"That's why I have no intentions of getting married. I have no problems in doing chores or cooking for my husband, but I am nobody's slave. "

"Up until the guy I‚Äôm dating now, they all lived on the same street. It was a freaky coincidence and made visiting that stretch of town pretty awkward."
"This is the right answer. 

There is ok, yeah, sure and then there is enthusiasm behind it. I am guilty of not saying no myself due to being afraid of the other persons reaction due to previous assaults. While those people did not assault me because I consented it felt awful to my mind and body. It also shocked me that a guy would continue and enjoy themselves w a girl who is pretty much playing dead. Participatory sex is where it‚Äôs at. "
"i'm a bi girl who's closeted to my family, my brother knows my account but i'm not gonna bother to make a throwaway for one comment haha. i recently started dating a girl and they think we're just really good friends. keeping it from them is really hard because they've almost walked in on us a couple times. it's even scary with innocent things like holding hands and kissing. after hiding my whole life i'm finally starting to gather the courage and i'm planning on coming out soon. they're all accepting people, but it's just scary not knowing exactly how they're gonna react, which i think is a universal lgbt experience, "
"Okay I was giving my husband then boyfriend some guff once about never buying me flowers and he kept insisting he did when I kept insisting he didn‚Äôt. Then he flicked the necklace he gave me and told me he DID. The first necklace he ever gave me was a white and yellow gold wreath of flowers. He was totally right, and I felt terrible lol. He gave me flowers that never die and I was too dumb to realize the meaning at the time. "
"Stop being so defensive... growing up, his step-dad was a monster to him. Like, would beat him because he came home from school 5 minutes late, assuming he was being a hooligan. 

Fast forward, now he‚Äôs incredibly defensive about everything. Even if I‚Äôm not ‚Äúgetting on to him,‚Äù he puts up his guard. He does it with everyone and it‚Äôs honestly the most frustrating thing about him. 

I had an abusive upbringing and in the past 5 years, I‚Äôve worked really hard to accept criticism better and stop assuming everyone hates me. He doesn‚Äôt have a lot of self-awareness or insight though, so he hasn‚Äôt done the same. For example, I‚Äôll ask ‚Äúhey, did you take the dog out?‚Äù And his response will be, in a hastened, defensive tone, ‚Äúno but it‚Äôs because i was making my lunch for work, I‚Äôm going to!!!‚Äù

Mind you, I‚Äôm not your classic nag. When I ask these things, it‚Äôs usually in a song-songy, compassionate voice specifically not to trigger him. It doesn‚Äôt work. If he even THINKS you‚Äôre saying something that isn‚Äôt 100% positive to him, he loses his shit.  

It‚Äôs taking a huge toll on our relationship, if I‚Äôm being honest. He was seeing a therapist to help, but stopped going. I‚Äôve gotten him self-help books, but he won‚Äôt read them. I‚Äôm not sure where to go from here, but he‚Äôs got to understand that I can live the rest of my life feeling vilified every time I ask a question. To him, it‚Äôs a personality quirk but it makes me feel like I‚Äôm the bad guy all the time..."
"Being transgender made me live as female online for a decade before I came out and transitioned. It was ridiculously stressful in itself to have such a secret second life, even without all the gender dysphoria and fear of the future all being tangled up with it."
"9/10 it‚Äôs colic and when you get that diagnosis 85% of the time you just feel bad for baby because you know they‚Äôre uncomfortable and in pain and there‚Äôs next to nothing you can do as a parent besides try and soothe. It‚Äôs a helpless feeling, and it breaks your heart. "
"Same! They were all insecure but tried to cover it up; so at first they seemed super confident but over time their insecurities all came out. 

Insecurities in general aren‚Äôt a bad thing, we all have them, but these were big and detrimental to the relationship. "
"I‚Äôve sent him this before! I think the problem is he isn‚Äôt doing it maliciously, he just doesn‚Äôt see the things that need doing. He tries really hard for a week and then goes back to normal. "
I personally find it impossible to be attracted to someone that I have to treat like a toddler. If I'm now your mother because you can't take care of yourself then we're not banging. 
"I'd tell my senior foster guy that his family didn't abandon him (they died) and that they loved him very very much.

And does he like his food, and are we hiking too much? "
"Not yell at me when I'm having a panic attack and to not take it personally.

"This totally pisses me off too, even his mother is like ""look you can't blame him for this - you need to give him clear instructions and a list of things to do"". She does this with her husband and he's like an incapable little puppy when she's not around. I don't want that, I just need some shared responsibility.

Also then, writing instructions and making a list is just one more thing I have to add to my list of things to do, which is already kind of full. If I forget to add anything to the list it's an immediate  get out clause and my fault for not telling him.

Mothers, please please please teach your kids life skills and resilience otherwise you're just making it someone else's problem in 20 years time."
I read this as ‚Äúmake dinner for breakfast‚Äù and I was so impressed for a second. 
"This guy had mentioned in one section that he was an OB/GYN and farther down in his profile he had a two paragraph rant about wanting a ""clean"" woman and that since women can‚Äôt be trusted he would be ""personally inspecting"" his dates for STDs. "
"Gosh I've experienced this. Truly wonderful individuals but I always seem to care more. In both after like a year they slowly stop putting much effort in to make me feel valued or just don't put any energy into thinking about me beyond a surface level/the next time we can hang out.  I believe they did all love me, but were never ""in love"" with me. 

It's taught me a lot though, I need someone to enthusiastically be with me, not because it's nice/convenient! "
I thought it was just us
"Just genuinely ask 

Honestly, a lot of guys don't ask and just assume a woman will speak up on her own. Something about asking can ""kill the moment."" Well obviously it can kill the moment! If she doesn't want it, moment killed! As it should be. But if she is enthusiastic about wanting it then it likely will only make the mood better. 

If a guy forgets to ask and thinks body language is enough to understand consent, it won't make it easy to be assertive and stop him. 

Sometimes a women will speak up, but sometimes she won't. We've been conditioned to not speak up in all areas of life, not just sex. So if a guy doesn't ask 'hey, do you want to have sex,' then it can be hard to say no. For a lot of women it would go: 'um, excuse me dude. I see you are initiating intimacy but I'm really sorry but I'm just not sure I'm into having sex right now. But no offense meant and I'm so sorry because I can see you're horny' 

Conversation should go like this: 
M: hey, do you want to be intimate right now? No worries if you aren't in the mood.
F: hell yeah 
M: okay cool, how far do you want to go?
F: All the way! (Alternative responses can be: let's just make out, or, let's just do oral) 
M: cool, let me know if at any time you change your mind

OR 

M: hey, do you want to be intimate right now? No worries if you aren't in the mood.
F: actually I don't really feel like it
M: okay, want to watch a movie or go out or something else? 

Whatever you do, don't ask a million follow ups like why not or will you be in her mood later. That way she remains comfortable telling you no. 

And it's important to note that sometimes women want to be intimate but not have sex. So asking how far is important because sometimes we just want to make out or something but it's hard to stop a guy in the middle of it all. Get on the same page beforehand. 

Also have an open conversation about sex when you're not in a sexy situation helps a lot. Like over a meal or something just tell her ""hey, I heard sometimes women don't say no. I want you to know you can always say no and I will never hold it against you."" 
"
This has made my entire night
This is the kind of initiative I wish my BF would have. 
"A little different because I was legal but I met my boyfriend when he was 22 and I was 18. I have very strong, supportive sisters and they were immediately suspicious of what a 22 year old would be doing with a 18 year old. But we met in college, it wasn‚Äôt like he was trolling my high school tracking my birthday and when they met him and realized what a good guy he was they were happy for me. They love him now. I still get suspicious when I see adults with people that are just barely adults because often times (in my experience anyway) it is a predatory situation but there are always exceptions! "
That can't be a coincidence 
What do you mean by unicorn hunting?
"One of the huge things that bothers me is that when I go out with my girlfriends or am late getting home on a weeknight due to the oldest‚Äôs activities, it‚Äôs like time stands still at home. The other three don‚Äôt get put to bed.  No jammies are on.  Teeth aren‚Äôt brushed.  Stories aren‚Äôt being read. Dude, I go out to get a break from the kids, please don‚Äôt just pause time and make me put kids to bed at 10 pm when I get home from a nice night out with my girlfriends. Make an attempt. It just really makes me not want to go out with my girlfriends next time because I know I have to deal with tired, whiny children. "
"I would have said cheese, but I ate so much I got gallstones and needed an operation. Now I‚Äôve had my gallbladder removed I can eat it again though. "

I'm the type to make home cooked meals, spend time to give back rubs, do cutesy things and help out in any way I can. Always listening and looking out for things they might like while I'm out and about.

"Yes! I told my ex this many times. He always responded ""flowers die, it's a waste of money."" 8 years and I think I got flowers from him once..."

"That people are super racist when it comes to Asian men. I had women confide in me CONSTANTLY that they would never date an Asian guy. It was crazy. I also started to notice how they‚Äôre portrayed in the media. It‚Äôs awful. I learned they fair the worst, along with black women (another group I find particularly attractive) in things like online dating. My boyfriend was small, probably 5‚Äô7‚Äù and dipped down to around 115 sometimes (although I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and 100-105 so we looked suited to each other in terms of traditional size expectations), but he was EXTREMELY attractive. I‚Äôd say he was more attractive than me, honestly. I couldn‚Äôt believe I would be in such high demand in the dating pool (I got 300-400 messages a day on okcupid when we broke up, and we live in a medium-sized city, and he was lucky to get one) as a moderately attractive, broke, white girl while he was a gorgeous, employed, Asian guy. It was crazy to me. People are assholes. "
I believe that's a huge part of post partum depression. I felt it strong with my first child. Shes 14 now and the bond got really strong over the years.
I could've written those exact same words. Thankfully they were all pretty great people and things would usually end quite amicably after anywhere from a few months to two years.
I dont like when they talk about porn/masturbatoin in front of me

"If they just cared more about keeping a neat and tidy living space.

I admit that I'm probably a bit more neurotic than most when it comes to living spaces, but... Just pick up your clutter or wipe the counter after you make coffee so there aren't grounds or stains on it."
"I don‚Äôt know üò© I‚Äôm 5 months pregnant and I guess I‚Äôm just scared I won‚Äôt be able to support 2 kids on my own, even with child support. I know I need to do something though"
Weekly facials. Steam my face. Wash then exfoliate. Clay mask. Shower. Moisturize. Then eat some M&amp;Ms near my happy light. 
I love everything you wrote. I wanted to add that I had an epidural and I felt like I was in shock. I couldn't feel anything so it was this whirlwind of realizing the whole labour thing was over and that the baby they plopped on me was the same one I had felt connected to throughout my pregnancy. It was so surreal and jarring and overwhelming and just... weird.
"Yeah, the line between ‚Äúsupporting and encouraging each other to be our best selves‚Äù and ‚Äúlocking into a relationship that won‚Äôt be satisfying for you long-term unless the other person changes‚Äù can be hard to define in the moment, especially with love-goggles on, but it‚Äôs pretty important."
"My son (he is 5) was an accidental pregnancy but very wanted. Once I got pregnant his dad became extremely emotionally and financially abusive. It was horrible. I lived in fear.

When my son was born we had broken up but he was still heavily involved and remained abusive. 

I never felt that initial love for my son. He was colicky, he would scream for 10-12 hours at a time, he never slept. I was a newly single mom with an ex who retained control over everything I did. I was so emotionally burnt out. I got severe PPD and remember having intrusive thoughts about wishing my son would just die or go away.

Around 3 months in his dad left the province for work and I got used to being alone. And I fell in love with my son. And as he has gotten older I've just grown to love him so so much. He is my whole world. I love seeing him grow into his own person.

I felt so guilty for years about this. Now I've started accepting it. 

I just had my second child (a sperm donor baby) and it was totally different. "
"I always feel like either they like me more, or I like them more. Very rarely is it even. I've entered several relationships just kind of ""meh"" about the guy, but honestly they persuaded me, and then I grew to love/ care deeply for them. But I always feel guilty, like they deserve better than someone who is only lukewarm on them. I also feel guilty because sometimes... not lying per se, but fudging the truth, and especially emotion, can be so easy to do. In my head I can think ""this guy is whatever"" but in person, a gentle stroke, a lingering look, and I know I've got them hook line and sinker. And I do truly enjoy time with them, but sometimes you can feel it, the depth of their emotion that swallows you up and wraps you in it. It kind of tricks you and makes you think that maybe you like them too. But after a while, all that fades, and you're left with yourself. as always. "
"Make it very clear that you aren't going to flip out if she says no. Say it openly. ""Do you want to keep going? I'm totally cool with whatever you're feeling."""
"I was in debt up to my eyeballs; I looked around at all the material things I had acquired and realized I didn't have a single person in the world that liked me, for me, and that none of it ""worked."" I was still in pain. 

I started dating my now husband, and he was so kind, warm, and open. I didn't want to have any more fake relationships, and I didn't want to lose him. I was sick of being lonely, So I stopped lying. 

From there it escalated into coming clean to my old friends.  And then went to therapy because I wanted to be the best me for not only my husband, but for myself and for the children I may have in the future."

Ask him if anything is stressing him out and maybe take him out for dinner (try to find foods that raise T levels) and then see. Men like to be wined and dined too and if he still has no drive get his T checked it could be that.

Keeping your life from falling apart around your head is absolutely more important than sex. 
Mean girls is the closest movie I‚Äôve seen to being a movie with all females that‚Äôs not often classified as a chick flick. Next to that is pitch perfect. But I can‚Äôt think of many more movies that fit this bill. It seems if you have female leads it automatically=chick flick which for some reason has a negative connotation. 
"Ableism is where I tend to get hung up.  Specifically mental ableism.  And it's not so much that I struggle with it; I just don't think I fully understand it.  

Like, broadly, I get it.  Don't make people's lives miserable because they have a mental illness or intellectual disability.  Eugenics bad, tolerance good.  Cool, I'm with you.  But that's *so* broad that the specifics trip me up.  Like some people consider using words like ""stupid"" to be ableist, but I don't understand why. Other's think that trying to treat or ""fix"" people with mental illnesses or disorders is ableist.  I know a lot of anti-ableist activism is aimed at things like autism, but where do mood disorders fit into that?  Personality disorders?  Addiction?  There's a huge thing about narcissists being abusive on Reddit.  Is that ableist?  

Idk, it really confuses me, I think partly because we tend to use the same language for *all* neurodiverse people when the spectrum is actually very, very wide.  So then I end up asking stupid questions like, ""but where's the line?!"" "
"Spend time with me for the sake of spending time with me. 

2nd place answer: get a job, he lost his job the week before Christmas and hasn‚Äôt put any effort in to finding a new one, I know it‚Äôs depression and I know it will pass but it‚Äôs getting harder to cope each week he‚Äôs home all day and won‚Äôt do dishes/clean/cook. "

"One of my best friends only talks about herself when we hang out. She'll ask how I'm doing, and she won't really let me finish and she'll start talking. I understand that she's excited about whatever thing is going on in her life, but I hate that it's not really a conversation at all. Sometimes when there's a lull in our conversation I'll try changing the subject, but she won't acknowledge I'm talking and goes right back to talking about herself. She's not a bad person by any mean, but I recently noticed I just hate hanging out with her now."
Nearly every night for my husband and I. We have an alarm that goes off at 11:30 that means it's time to stop talking and actually get some sleep. We'd go half the night otherwise.

"I have been hiding my five-year-long relationship with a wonderful man from my family. They are very religious, and in our religion a woman isn‚Äôt allowed to marry outside of the faith. Also we don‚Äôt really ‚Äúdate‚Äù in the typical Western fashion. I don‚Äôt even believe in said religion anymore but I can‚Äôt tell anyone because I would probably be disowned by my family (both immediate and extended). 

Surprisingly, it wasn‚Äôt that hard to keep it a secret. Back when I lived with my parents, I would just say I was going out to ‚Äúhang out with friends‚Äù and they never really asked questions. But now that the relationship is getting more serious, I know I have to tell them someday and it weighs heavy on my mind. 

I also can‚Äôt mention my SO at work because I work with one of my relatives. I‚Äôve been finding it hard to make small talk with my other colleagues and get to know each other on a more personal level. "
"I'm a midwife and there is a real push these days to stop withholding fluids and small amounts of food from women in labour, as there is little evidence it prevents surgical complications in healthy low risk pregnant women.

"Mine too, except that all that time on his phone, he was apparently texting other women. "
"Call women ""females"". "
"My husband does this all the time. Everything gets piled on the kitchen table and the coffee table and when there's no more room, it surrounds the coffee table. The deal we have right now is that he is in charge of cleaning the living room and, even still, I ended up getting annoyed and started picking up garbage and empty boxes from the floor that have been sitting there since before Christmas!"
"My friend got married to someone she'd been dating for three months before they got engaged.  They're still married now, about five years later, and have a newborn son.  Her husband just graduated as a pharmacist.

It's a happy ending so far and I'm glad she got one because she really deserved it."
"The specific details of my ""double life"" don't matter much beyond the result - I have learned that hiding who you are is very unlikely to make you a happier person.  I have finally started to trust a very small number of people from my ""public"" life with more of a full picture of who I am and it has brought me some pain, but also a lot of love, relief and happiness. "
"And as a follow-up....

"I have a bit of a quadruple life. I work in an office, I have a kink life, I'm polyamorous, and I'm also gender fluid. So depending on where you know me from, you may not get to know me very well. 

Of course my office is the most conservative group, so there's almost no crossover into other areas. The other three can commingle relatively easily. I have people at work who follow me on Instagram, where you can see some pics from various parties, if they look back far enough. 

Being poly, some of my partners work in super conservative organizations so I have to be cognizant of not inadvertently outing a partner. And many of them have spouses or other partners who are not out to their families. 

So yes, I have a super compartmentalized life. "
"I'm a med student and I come from a middle class family, which means I get to hear the really ridiculous things some doctors/students who come from more privileged backgrounds say.

Examples:

Classmate: ""I really don't know why people get roommates, living in your own is so much nicer.""

Urologist: ""You need at least $200k to raise a family in this city."" (Note: said city is going through a rise in house prices, but the COL isn't *that* high.)

Paediatric surgeon: ""My partner works in general practice, and they love it, but their pay is a joke. They only earn $90/hour!"""

Once a month I‚Äôll eat half a dose of an edible form of cannabis (half gives me a good buzz but doesn‚Äôt get me dysfunctionally high) and take a long hot steamy shower with music when I start feeling the effects. Then I‚Äôll play video games and/or watch cartoons and/or watch YouTube videos in super soft and fresh comfy pajamas with a hot cocoa (sometimes with a splash of rum) while cuddling my cat. 
"Research of all sorts. I work with a giant group. We each create a bland alias &amp; observe public systems. Nursing school this time around. And then I do some creative leadership to follow up with improvements. It‚Äôs been about 6 years since I started this project and it is sad. 

I live in poverty because these are the areas that need the most improvement. I usually pose as a schizophrenic to observe how our system treats those who are filed/labeled as mentally disabled. 

Sadly, when in the work environment, I show no signs of schizophrenia. They only see it on paper or hear it by word of mouth &amp; begin to mistreat me. They get fired &amp; then we relocate and hire different researchers. It is exhausting, heart-breaking work. It is the pit of my despair. 

I am also very passionate about it. I look forward to a creative retirement where I‚Äôm fully compensated. "

"I would agree with your ""rotten luck"" theory if we were talking 10 or 20 years of failed relationships. I don't know the head count (crass terminology, sorry) but we're talking 40+ years of dates with women, some who have gone on to very successful marriages. 

Thank you for that ray of positivity. I will take it with me and keep it in my heart."
Saying what they believe women should do and how they should behave. 
"Yep. Even up to the point right after they were born I'd be like, hmm if he's stillborn, I'm all good. Fast forward to them being 3 months responding and smiling and I can't imagine my life away from them. The 2nd one took longer for me to really love. He was a cranky, sickly boy and who was also headstrong. I've come to finally enjoy him around when he turned 5. 

I guess it's has something to do with my personality: if u cant love me back, I'm done giving my love to u. And kids are so utterly selfish so it took me some time. "

"I‚Äôm going through this with my boyfriend. Mine is words of affirmation. Just tell me I‚Äôm doing good or that I‚Äôm pretty or a good girlfriend. He said he‚Äôs worried it‚Äôll sound fake and that he doesn‚Äôt wanna do it.

"My husband will make a sandwich...and leave the wrapper from the cheese on the kitchen counter EVERY.SINGLE.TIME. Sometimes it‚Äôll be right next to the trash can and it never finds the trash unless I put it there. He also does this with soap boxes. Every time he grabs a new bar of soap, the box will sit on the bathroom counter directly above the cabinet containing the trash can, FOR DAYS. Until I finally throw it. I seriously do not understand this logic."

The clock went back for seconds (a second helping).
A few weeks ago my SO made some comment about me spending too much time on my phone so I downloaded an app to track how much time I spent on my phone and what apps I was using. Turned out I was spending 4 hours and sometimes more browsing Reddit/Instagram/websites. Some days were up to 6 hours. Since then I've intentionally cut down on it. I know you didn't ask for advice but maybe that's something worth looking into. 
Amen. It never ceases to amaze me how many guys can't seem to manage simple household chores lol. I been single most of my adult life and it's second nature to me to clean and cook and do laundry and all that. Guess I'm just used to living alone and not having someone to do it for me.
"Making time to spend with me. It has been a huge issue - he seems to have time to golf, hang out with his friends, and pursue hobbies...but when it comes to me, I always feel like last priority "
I have. He says he can‚Äôt cook. I tell him I‚Äôm not expecting an amazing dinner just edible food. I‚Äôve gone as far to write down step by step instructions and prep some of the food the night before. I‚Äôve given him easy ideas like frozen fish and French fries. All you have to do is pop it in the oven. He‚Äôll only cook if I nag him to do it. I‚Äôve kind of given up on asking but in return I only cook 1-2 times a week and he is on his own for other days. I meal prep for myself now. 
"Glasses is my recurring trait too. Every guy I‚Äôve dated or even been interested in has had glasses or contact lenses, so maybe it means I‚Äôm most appealing to men who can‚Äôt see right? "
"About 4 years ago I had to admit that pretty much every life choice I was making wasnt working out. I hated my job, hated my apartment, was pushing my loved ones away, was drinking and smoking weed way too much, I wasn't eating regularly, my physical health was awful, and I wasn't doing anything constructive to remedy the situation. It was a rock bottom time for me. 

I moved into my parents basement to save money for 3 months, quit my job and moved thousands of miles away to a city I had only visited once and knew only one person, got into an entirely different line of work, got sober and quit smoking, got my diet and exercise in order, adopted a shelter dog, and started fresh. 

Hands down the best decision I ever made. I'm happier and healthier than I've ever been. I have an incredible community of happy successful people around me, and I'm learning something new every day in my new career. "

"From my own perspective, as a guy, I've always been told that boys are naturally messier and less organised. When people see clutter, they'll just sigh and tell me that's so typical of a guy. Over time, that engrained itself into my self-image - guys are inherently messy, even though that's utter bollocks.

Unfortunately, since guys get a pass for being messy when they're young, they rarely learn to organise or clean up properly. You're told you're messy, and you're not even told how to clean up or what to do. Someone tells you off and does it for you. I've never learned how to clean up regularly, because no one has ever taken the time to show me how.

What used to happen in the past was that, when things got really bad, I'd spend an entire day just cleaning the whole house. Not in a very efficient way, but just struggling through because I lacked the skills to organise things properly. It would cost me a lot of energy, I didn't know what I was doing, and since I only cleaned when it was really messy I also didn't build the skills needed to properly keep things organised as I went along.

My current girlfriend, and whatever happens I'll always be thankful for her patience and guidance in this, was the first to actually realise what was happening. So, instead of getting annoyed, she'd tell me to get into the kitchen, and she showed me step by step how to do the dishes in a much faster, easier way. Suddenly it clicked, and doing dishes became less of a monster of a task since I had a better way of doing them. Now, I'm able to keep the kitchen clean most of the time, much cleaner than before. The clutter of things that I left in my wake as I spent my day? Gone. Her solution was to put a crate in the corner of the room, out of view, where I could put things I didn't necessarily want to put back in their proper place right away. At the end of the week I walk through the house, returning the things in the crate to the right place. We cut down on unnecessary surface areas, so I'd be guided towards using the crate, and seeing how much I put in there I started to realise how much clutter I was creating throughout the day, so I started to clear away things immediately after using them. In order to cut down on the amount of dishes we went through the kitchen cupboards and kept only four of each type of plate. The rest went into storage. Suddenly, I started running out of plates much quicker, and it helped me also realise that I was eating more than I should, which in turn led to weight loss, something I've been working on for quite a while. 

In doing all these things, her showing me how I was being inefficient, how I was wasting my energy, I finally learned the skills that I had not had to learn since 'boys are inherently messy'. Without a doubt this isn't the case for everyone: we all have differing levels of neatness, and some things won't change. All I can say is that in my case, and I'm not too sure if I'm alone in this, I was often told I was inherently messy and not taught the skills to remedy that. Getting told off for being messy made me feel even worse, because it reinforced that view without giving me any way to remedy it, even though I'd really like to do better. Yes, it might be annoying to take someone by the hand and showing them step by step how to do things, but sometimes that's one of the few ways to bring long-lasting change to the situation. At least, that's what helped in my case. And I can safely say that seeing how happy my girlfriend is nowadays when she arrives at my place and sees it properly cleaned makes me prouder than I thought it would. "
"Exactly this. Height is not a huge factor for me in regards to sexual attraction; I was with my ex for 14 years, and has 5'2"" to my 5'3"". But now dating a tall man, its fascinating how much more secure he is and how much less cocky and selfish. Idk if it's just all the abuse short men get growing up or what, but every guy I've known under 5'8"" seems to have had the most sensitive masculinity that requires constant stroking. It's such a relief not to feel like I'm constantly emasculating someone just by existing. "
"I was just thinking this. Wether it's your best friend, partner or pet, they were strangers to you at one point and you had to learn each other. It takes time to develop your relationship, but eventually you get to the point of I love you to bits. "

"My Hs ex boyfriend is the son of a ""billboard plastic surgeon"" and was incredibly wealthy. I could type paragraphs about his rich kid syndrome because he thought he was untouchable and did pretty much Whatever he wanted. 

So to preface this, every year I'd known him his dad bought him a brand new BMW M-series car, when the following story went down his dad had just bought him his graduation present which was a loaded high end M-series. Ex always called them my ""M."" 

One of the funniest versions of his rich kid syndrome however was when I broke up with him (because he tried to peel the condom off the first time I'd agreed to have sex with him). He called me relentlessly, showed up at my work and bedroom window and usually I didn't answer or got my boss or dad to chase him away. But one time he caught me coming out of work in the parking lot and begged me to talk with him. When he finally realized I wasn't getting back together with him come hell or high water he started screaming 

""you realize you can't ride in my ""M"" anymore! You get that you'll never ride in my ""M"" again. Never! No more ""M"" for you!"" 

It was hysterically funny that after all his bullshit, his stupid car was his supposed ace in the hole. 

I started dating my now husband about 5 months later and I was soooooo relieved when he showed up in a well loved, but well used Toyota pick up truck (that we still have). Needless to say the ""M"" didn't do much for me. "
That would be an excellent tinder bio for a serial killer. 
"Soon to be ex husband but....

Treat me as an equal. Don‚Äôt say you want a partner and not a ‚Äòchild‚Äô but then treat me as a roommate that cannot function without you. Make decisions with me, not telling me after you‚Äôve made them. (Car insurance, plans with people, etc. )

Show me affection. My love languages are gifts and physical affection. Don‚Äôt roll your eyes when I ask for a hug, get me flowers once in awhile, I don‚Äôt care if they die, it‚Äôs the thought behind it. 

Put me first. Not your friends, not your hobby, not alcohol, not weed, me. Like you promised to when we got married. I‚Äôm more important than filmmaking so you can go play director. 

Care for my emotions, don‚Äôt deny them and decide that I‚Äôm too emotional for any difficult conversation just because I cry. I‚Äôm a human woman, not a robot. And I don‚Äôt shut down anytime something happens. I‚Äôm way stronger than you give me credit for. 

Show appreciation for the things I do. Don‚Äôt rag on me to exercise/lose weight but then sabotage my diet and refuse to go the gym with me. I have chronic pain and autoimmune issues, of course I can‚Äôt do all the same things you can. 

Sorry for the vent. Men, if you want to be respected in your relationship, you need to respect your partner. Respect her opinions, put her needs first and on the same level that you put yours. We aren‚Äôt fragile, but we do need to be cared for, just like you do. Treat others how you‚Äôd like to be treated, first and foremost, your wife. "
"This is what I get as well.  He'll point out something that needs done, instead of just doing it himself.  We got new pots and pans, he doesn't want them put in the dishwasher, incase they'll warp... but I have to ask him after hours to clean them. I am the one washing dishes and cooking everyday, why should I also clean the kitchen, after his mess, before I can make something.  "

"Looks like you're pulling stuff you hate, that doesn't make you happy nor in peace with youreslf, and can end up pretty badly. Escorting can be dangerous. You never know what your 'client', whomever can they be, will do to you. Also, I believe you don't feel at ease being an addict, frying your neurons spilling out lies in front of people that genuinely need help, and just wasting your time for little.

I feel bad for you. Don't get me wrong, you're in a pretty bad situation. Yet, it's always on risk of turning really bad, really fast. It's so easy to get caught, have your double life exposed, or OD, get a bad drug batch, and believe me, you'll never be the same again. Drugs basically destroy who you are and everything you could be. Your chances of getting a normal job would go south because dug tests.

I believe the best favor you could do to get yourself of that hole is getting clean (maybe rehab, if you can get help of family or friends), and get a job, and just live a proper life. You may regret not doing this now, in the future. "

"My grandparents got engaged 2 weeks after meeting each other. Married 3 months later. Together for 60+ years until my grandfather passed away. My grandmother is 94 and still with us. 

They lived with their parents when they first got married. Ended up having 6 kids. 

Grandad‚Äôs pick up line was ‚Äòcan I hold your camera for you?‚Äô (They met at a Returned Services League ‚Äòdo‚Äô after the Korean War - Grandma was their with her brothers taking photos for everyone). 

Grandma says she knew all there was to know about Grandad after 2 weeks. He was a simple man. What she saw was what she got and that was enough. She was ready to sign up.

She never romanticised their relationship. They both put in hard work. But, it also turns out she is a *very* good judge of character. "

I could never imagine there would be a time where we wouldn‚Äôt be in each other‚Äôs life but I started to realize after so many years of friendship I was putting in more effort than they were. 

They never came to my place to hang out. I always had to go to theirs. At the time, I was bouncing from place to place and didn‚Äôt really have my own space so I understood their reluctance but when I eventually found a stable place to live they still never came over. So if I didn‚Äôt go to their place, we wouldn‚Äôt hang out. 

I also realized I was always the first person to reach out. When ever we had disagreements I always had to be the bigger person and make efforts to smooth things over. If I didn‚Äôt, I was accused of being a bad friend and not caring. I noticed I was only called first if they had a question or needed something from me. 

One day, I decided I wasn‚Äôt going to be the first to reach out. There wasn‚Äôt an argument or disagreement on the table. We were honestly in a good place, so I was confident I‚Äôd hear from them. That was about four years ago and I haven‚Äôt heard from that person since. 

It hurts a lot, I still think about that person and wish the very best for them. I usually get over failed friendships after a couple months but years later it‚Äôs still a soft spot for me because this person was very important to me.  I don‚Äôt have any anger towards this person just a lot of disappointment. It‚Äôs just sad to know that I cherished a friendship that was disposable to them.

"Not at all. Not because we are uncomfortable talking about sex or anything, we can talk about sex generally.   
But  we respect the privacy of our partners and therefore don't talk about our personal sex lives."
"I do not find porn or sex work to be empowering to women in any way, considering that so much of it features the disrespect and abuse (even simulated) of women (and I am not talking about BDSM. I also no how much of sex work involves human trafficking."
Oh my god it is extra newborn time! I didn't even realise. No wonder I hated my life...
"I broke up with my last boyfriend for exactly this reason.  I normally have a high sex drive, but he murdered it by making me his mother. Add to that refusing to listen to any of my wants/needs in the bedroom and when I asked him why he wasn't interested in engaging in more foreplay he replied, ""I am just interested in the hole.""  Yup.  Sex drive gone."
"Because it is a myth that men are always horny and always hornier than women.  Men fall in all areas of the libido scale.  I have a much higher libido than my husband and he needs to be in the right mental and emotional state for sex, whereas I just want to get laid and have much less attachment to the intimacy.  Nothing is wrong with either of us just because we don't match the outdated stereotypes.  No-one should feel pressured to have sex if they aren't feeling like it."
My boyfriend claims the floor is the largest shelf. That REALLY gets me upset. 
"Not be so negative. I'm a positive person and I try to help him see the bright side but it's so draining. He curses about everything and it just wears on me. He loves me and constantly tells me how happy I make him, so that's always nice. But sometimes you just gotta live and let be! "
"I would love to publish erotica and live off of that.  It's actually a dream or mine to have something publish, but I know my works aren't good enough.  

I know for some this isn't embarrassing, but for me it would be due to my background.   "
"Constantly 'joking' about wanting to have sex with me, or just making really shitty jokes about my gender. It really is a drag to hear the same tried jokes over and over again that are just a reminder of ""yea I'm a different gender than you, so what?"" It's pretty frustrating to be constantly reminded you're different from everyone else, especially when these jokes are dismissive and belittling. "
"I don't agree with choice feminism. If everything is feminism, then nothing is feminism. I will defend the right for an individual woman to, for example, be in a 24/7 dom/sub relationship, but there's nothing feminist at all about that choice, as far as I'm concerned. A woman gleefully choosing to submit to a man 24/7 is the patriarchy's wet dream. I would be extremely wary of any man who tried to pull the whole ""the sub has the real power!"" bullcrap. "
"There's a world of metaphor involving flipping, market crashes etc. here and I don't have time to properly explore it. Someone take over!"
"Stop asking me so many goddamn questions. I walk in the room on Saturday morning ‚ÄúWhy are you dressed?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you want to cook breakfast?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you want me to cook breakfast?‚Äù Do you want to feed the baby?‚Äù I sit down. ‚ÄúWhen did you last wash the baby?‚Äù ‚ÄúDid you change her this morning?‚Äù I get up to go pee. ‚ÄúWhy are you getting up?‚Äù ‚ÄúCan you make coffee?‚Äù 

My marriage feels more like an interrogation than anything most of the time. Bombarding me with a thousand questions isn‚Äôt the same as talking to a person or having a conversation. "
"A few times a week. We like to shower together or go on long walks after dinner and we often talk then. Yesterday we talked about Kamala Harris's announcement and the 2020 field, and what kind of politicians will be in the future. 

We've been together eight years. I wouldn't marry anybody who didn't want to talk to me a lot. "
"Oh my god this happened to me. I dated a guy this summer who was 40, I was 26. Very handsome and charming and successful but his ex wife I would put in the...average category. I feel horrible saying that but ya. I don‚Äôt think he dated much before her and he was fat as a teenager. 





So I start dating him and all his friends are like wtf lol but ok. I became very very close with his friends and family. And loved him to bits. Then he ghosted me and broke up with me over text. K, whatever, bye. Come to find out that he started dating another 26 year old, one of his EMPLOYEES. Everyone hated her and she dumped him (hahahahahahahahahahaha)"

If I can take a stack of them home, do it and then bring it back after.. 1000x better. Dream job. Lmao. 

I'm very much over working with people and being in a corporate environment. "
"There are way too many people that don't understand that talking like that, if you're joking or not, people that aren't joking sound the exact same as the people that are, they make the exact same jokes, and also (some do) claim that they're just joking. There's no way to differentiate so it's best to not be an asshole and not make sexist jokes."

"I don‚Äôt know if I led a double life but I had 2.5 years in where I very much wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúmyself.‚Äù I hurt my knee in gymnastics and before,  I was and being a college recruited athlete, NHS member, and genrally good kid. After I had my surgeries, I went off the rails and dated bad guys, lied about my age constantly to everyone from professional athletes to frat guys. Drank way too much, snuck out all the time and kissed and made out with probably between 50-75 different guys. I‚Äôm soooo lucky that I wasn‚Äôt raped or roofied because I put myself in so many bad spots. I dated an absolute piece of shit my senior year and slowly, slowly started to admit ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt who you are, stop it‚Äù because of him. I‚Äôm lucky that academics came easy and I still was able to get scholarships and didn‚Äôt derail my entire future. Right after prom night I basically did a 180 on my personality and I was done with designer clothes, overdone makeup and shoes, riding in expensive cars and lying to my parents. It‚Äôs a phase I‚Äôm glad I went through but I don‚Äôt ever wabt to go back."

"&gt; In the beginning it's important to establish good habits so you don't hurt yourself- a bit of reading on /r/running and browsing a few youtube offerings about proper form will set you right up.

The /r/C25K subreddit is a bit more friendly than /r/running. The running subreddit has more information, so shouldn't be skipped, but if you'd like a ""support"" sort of subreddit as you start the process, /r/C25k is the place to go.

&gt; And like I said it makes you feel so good that you won't care if you get glanced at. It is very empowering.

This is not a universal experience. I get no ""runner's high"", no matter the distance. It doesn't make me feel good. It doesn't feel empowering. I'm saying this because if you, The-Ginger-Lily, do not feel these things, that's fine. It's normal. It's not a sign you're doing something ""wrong"". Running *does* feel great for a lot of people, but for some it's just... another form of exercise. I need to do some sort of exercise for my health, and running is one that I don't mind that has less hassle than things I enjoy more. So I run."

"This happens to me, too. I think that everyone that is ""normal"" is kind of boring, so I end up with these seemingly fun and adventurous guys who turn out to have way more fucked up issues than I could even handle. From drug addiction to mental illness, to borderline abusive. Those are also the hardest relationships to get out of, IMO."

"For me it was after going through relationships (in general) where I always felt like I was in the wrong without understanding what exactly I did wrong. As it turns out i had been discounting and doubting my own feelings and beliefs.

After reading books on narcisistic and/or unavailable parents I saw my childhood in a different light, such as always stepping on eggshells, not being allowed to have an opinion etc. 

Imagine being raised for 25 years to feel and believe a certain way and learning to rewire your brain and perspectives, it‚Äôs not easy but really, it‚Äôs never too late."

"A friend of mine while I was in the Navy was from a very rich family.  Not Rockefeller rich, but he had never once cared about or thought about his everyday purchases.  He ended up joining the Navy for reasons.  

A few of us including him ended up in New York as tourists.  The rest of us had saved up money and budgeted and planned and this rich guy tagged along at the last second.  We went to a fancy steak place for dinner one night and we all ended up with expensive meals, roughly 50+ bucks a person.  Except our rich and clueless friend, who had had the steak and lobster and a bottle of wine and dessert and ended up with a bill of 200+ dollars.  And this restaurant would not split the bill by seat.

Rich friend suggested we just all pay equally and was so confused that we were not able to pay an extra hundred dollars for dinner that night.  It was baffling to him."

"I think the first 4 months or so can be the most difficult. It's hard to understand what their cries mean. It's hard to deal with the colic so many babies get at 6 weeks. That was always the worst time, IMO. When they are crying for an hour at a time and there's nothing you can do for them after you've done everything you can think of. Just hold them and rock them as they scream in your ear.

That's when it's good to have a wise, experienced friend around to turn to, or a good grandma who remembers.

I did not have either of those. Society loves to judge mothers, but damn, so many moms are doing it mostly alone. Even if they're married, they might still be mostly parenting alone. "
"They know who my partners are, who I'm crushing on, who I'm dating, and how that's going, but not much more than that.  Maybe that I'm particularly happy because I got lucky or tense because I haven't.

This. I struggled with this for a long time. It‚Äôs incredibly disheartening to still be sexualized by men when I am 100% not interested in them. Lesbians don‚Äôt exist for male pleasure. 
"I don‚Äôt believe in fat acceptance and I think a lot of the FA movement is anti-science and embodies anti-intellectualism. I don‚Äôt think fat is a feminist issue, so a lot of feminists would not consider me to be ‚Äúbody-positive.‚Äù

Having a little extra weight and looking like a person instead of an airbrushed photo of a swimsuit model is one thing. I understand the backbreaking, asinine pressure women feel to look ‚Äúhot.‚Äù But ‚Äúhotness‚Äù aside, if you try to tell me that carrying dozens or hundreds of unnecessary pounds of fat is not a health risk, you‚Äôre denying empirical evidence. If you‚Äôre seriously overweight, you can choose to do something about it or not, but obesity is not a good thing and it‚Äôs irresponsible to disregard your health."
"Definitely more sex! And add in some toys as well to make it fun. We have toys we haven‚Äôt even used yet. 

He could stop referring to me as some type of food. Saying things like ‚ÄúI want to eat you with some ketchup or BBQ sauce, you‚Äôre so yummy‚Äù doesn‚Äôt turn me on at all. 

He also likes to randomly pull my boobs out and grab one like it‚Äôs a burger and then puts it in his mouth to suck and says ‚Äúyum!‚Äù Or lets out a ‚Äúaaaahhh‚Äù afterwards. 

I‚Äôm not sure if this is his way of initiating sex but it is not very good at all lol and I have told him plenty of times. I give him plenty of bjs even when he doesn‚Äôt ask but he doesn‚Äôt do the same. Why do I have to ask? JUST DO IT. "

"I had an internal celebration this morning when my husband took the initiative to make breakfast when we woke up. He‚Äôs also been doing the dishes every day when he gets home from work. He‚Äôs afraid of the dishwasher and washes everything by hand instead which for some reason makes me annoyed that he‚Äôs making more work for himself.

I dunno what prompted this lately. We‚Äôve had many, many fights about me being our manager. Whatever it is, I can tell I‚Äôm less stressed out. Maybe that‚Äôs the result he wanted lol."
"Hey, thanks so much for your detailed comment. I really appreciate it! My husband has no issues with travel and crowds etc in general, just when it's combined with our kids being there. He travels for work frequently and has no issues there at all. His main issue is going somewhere with our kids, then having to deal with a ""meltdown"" kind of scenario. He just can't handle it. By himself he's perfectly fine. "
"My husband too. One time I accidentally spilled coffee on the counter and it dripped down the cabinets and he was so angry that he said we‚Äôd never be able to sell our house (many years down the road) because I warped the cabinets.

"Shorter guy here and it's refreshing to see that the  height itself isn't the problem for alot of woman but more so the insecurites behind it.

I definitely use to have a napoleon complex when I was younger and still sometimes now I wish I was abit taller (I'm 5,6) Times are changing and men are becoming alot more body conscious. But I get that woman want a guy as some of you have said who is secure and confident in himself, so I have done my best to work on it over the years and hide it from the woman I've dated if I feel down about myself . My insecurites is luggage I should be carrying not them. 

It's weird as in clubs you will rarely see the tall guys causing trouble. It's the little guys who have something to prove alot of the time. I find it funny as they just remind me of scrappy doo. üê∂

"Be willing to try new foods and food combinations. I‚Äôm a foodie and a very adventurous eater, but my husband is extremely picky.

"My partner and I are young and we DEFINITELY don‚Äôt have a dead bedroom (I gotta be thankful for that) but my libido is much higher than his and it has caused issues. The thing is that he works insane hours, goes to school, deals with a mental illness and takes a medication to help with it. There may be guys that have a similar set up to my SO and still desire sex all the time, but it‚Äôd be inconsiderate of me to not understand that having that lifestyle is extremely draining. Sex takes energy. Good sex especially takes both physical and mental energy. If you‚Äôre tapped out from working all the time, sex can often be too tiring. It‚Äôs not as simple as it being a ‚Äòsimple and enjoyable task‚Äô."

"I‚Äôve definitely lived a double life - for the last six years. That‚Äôs when my opiate addiction began. I never wanted to talk about it with anyone, so I had one main mask vs reality. The main mask was my work/school/social mask, allowing me to fake happy and content. I was self confident and more able to participate socially with my coworkers and friends. That mask led me into isolation as I discovered I wasn‚Äôt as good at hiding it as I thought. 

That double life is exhausting, so when I started treatment for my addiction I had a chance to let the real authentic me shine through, and I found myself caring less and less about other people‚Äôs opinions of me. I was able to accept that I‚Äôm not perfect, but rather perfectly imperfect. I have genuine hope and joy."

"Similar thing for me and my girlfriend. She wanted to keep our relationship from her parents until we were sure about us. I was 22 and she was 18 when we met (23 and 19 now).

"I had a guy friend get drunk one night and tell me how he'd fuck me because how ""cool I was"" and it made me *extremely* uncomfortable. 

Ended up getting together with a guy I met through him, and despite that guy being total shit in hindsight, the ""friend"" constantly made snide comments and talked shit to me, trying to break us up.  

Normally, I might think this is a concerned friend trying to look out for me and heed his warning... but after the drunken night, I doubted his motives for everything because men can be just as petty as they claim women are. "
"First time was early 20's. I was a young single mom and they were just young and single. I found out hard to relate to them, most drifted apart and I let them go. There was a huge load of drama when I dumped a boyfriend and the most popular friend was instantly in a relationship with him. I confronted her and she took me I had it all wrong and was just being hateful, which cost a lot of friends. At the same time I was going through a golgotha of stress and troubles which alienated a lot of friends, and my bff at the time was very unsupportive, toxic and just using me a a dumping ground. So I let almost everyone go and was very sad at the time. My feelings now almost 2 decades later is it was for the best. 

Last year I chose sobriety and divorced. I'm broke  and my ex is rich and loose with money. Not hard to see why most took his side. When I stopped talking to those friends, I was pretty angry. They know he's a liar, a cheater, an addict and a thief, that he was a bad husband. But partying means more to them so good riddance. I feel the same  today. Good riddance."

"I feel like a fixer upper sometimes, I'm not where I want to be career wise, living arrangement wise, and I have a lot of goals. Though, I don't expect anyone to do it for me and accept that while I don't have it all together that I'm working towards something to show for it. I've made a lot of lateral changes in the past. "
Can confirm. I was a colicy baby and now an IBS adult. I'm almost constantly in pain and there is nothing I can do to fix it.
"Tries to be overly affectionate, in an attempt to compensate for the fact that I have not had physical affection.  


That sounds weird, but I have one friend that I know means well, but he tries the rub my hair, and hug me while saying that I matter, and stuff like that, because he knows my love language is physical affection, but since my divorce, I have not gotten any physical affection. Which I appreciate where his heart is, but it makes me feel uncomfortable, AND it reminds me how much I miss comfortable physical touch.  
He does not do it as much now, because I have firmly told him that I don't feel comfortable. but occasionally he still will just start patting my hair or something."
"I love this, it's so right. I had a 29 hour labour, then at the end because we were both so worn out it was an emergency csection with my son not breathing for 3 minutes when he was born. It was traumatic, I didn't even want to look at him once we were finally on our own, the midwives were amazing, they could see I was struggling and took him with them for the first night. I just cried and said I couldn't do it. They gave me the space I needed to recover mentally. It's hard to say but it took a couple of months before I looked at him and felt love instead of trauma. Now I feel my heart skip a beat just looking at him (he's 13 now). I love both my kids to the moon and back but it was a rocky start x "
I get no affection and no sex. So could be worse. 
"I don‚Äôt hang out with people I‚Äôm uncomfortable with anymore but I used to have a guy friend who would get me drunk with him just to tuck me in bed and leave the room. Like that was it. We‚Äôd get a little drunk at his house then he‚Äôd take my keys and make me sleep in his bed and he‚Äôd tuck me in. I‚Äôm a light sleeper and he never tried anything creepy 

I think he just had a tuck in fetish which was fine with me that boy had the softest memory foam bed ever "
"I still keep in touch with the family as they moved some time ago. The mom will upload family photos, and all I can think is... ""well, there's Mr. Pimple-penis again..."" 

Heavy sigh. "
Every last one  had a drug or drinking problem (or both!). And they're all pretty close with their mothers. Very rarely have I deviated from this pattern. 
"Be happy with what we have. Our life is amazing, but he gets bogged down worrying about the parts he wishes were better and never enjoys the things that are great today. I know he doesnt mean it that way, but it makes me feel like there is no pleasing him. "
"I feel like I‚Äôve lost a lot of friends and therefore missed out on a lot of fun opportunities because my social anxiety gets in the way. Even if someone invites me to something and I want to go, I immediately think of all the social interactions I‚Äôm gonna have if I go, and then I convince myself not to. I make up excuse after excuse for why I can‚Äôt go and I guess people start catching on that I‚Äôm never gonna go and then they just stop asking to do things all together. "
"Well, technically, but there is such a thing as rotten luck and it sounds more like that's your situation - certainly if the relationships aren't ending for similar reasons."
Personally I wouldn‚Äôt date someone who used gay as an insult or who refused to do things based on insecurity in his sexuality.
"Well said. 

I have issues with choice feminism especially when the choices still seem to be made under a patriarchal umbrella. Example: I don't shave my legs when no one will see them (yay winter!), but I do shave them when I know people will see them. There doesn't seem, to me, to be anything feminist about my choosing to shave my legs. I'm making that choice because I don't want to deal with the comments, or looks, I might get if I don't. (This comes up a lot for me when I read discussions about body hair removal.)"
"Out of curiosity, did you not notice this struggle before your girlfriend? Did it not occur to you to google/YouTube how to do something daunting or that you were unsure how to do? "
"I‚Äôd remind him that in all the years he‚Äôs lived with us, I‚Äôve never once forgotten to feed him in the morning, so it‚Äôd be really nice when the baby wakes up at 4am and needs to be fed and changed, if he could just chill and let me feed him when I‚Äôm done rather than yelling at me and biting my leg while I‚Äôm holding his brother. 

I‚Äôd also let him know that just because he has a new brother that‚Äôs louder and needs more attention right now doesn‚Äôt mean we love him any less. 

Also lizards are our friends, stop eating them. "
I am currently pregnant and I am so worried I am going to have a baby like that that just screams and cries constantly. 
"Am guy, and share a similar path of moves...

Only difference here is upstate new yorkers hike and like to talk horses/complain about the city.

100%. If I'm your mother now then we're not having sex because that's just creepy. 
"That I'm responsible for my own happiness and I can't blame anyone else if I'm not happy. 

My husband and I had a rough patch and I was feeling angry and upset that I'd given up a lot of opportunities on his account, and was mad at him for not changing...and ultimately I just realized I chose to give up those things and he is who he is - I can either stay and accept it, or leave, but ultimately....I'm the one choosing it. I can't blame other people for that. It was a really bitter realization, but once I got over it things improved a lot. But it was a rough few months. It's a lot easier to blame other people than to own your choices. "
"&gt; Sometimes I'll see how far I can push it, and just leave *shit everywhere.*

"What kind of overalls does super Mario wear?

Why do scuba divers fall off the boat backwards?

Cuz if they fell forwards they‚Äôd fall back into the boat. "
"&gt;Yes, my trama was something I was trying to cover up for so long. But unpacking the baggage is the only way to move forward.
I didn't realize how much of a double life I was living, till you said that."
"I second this my husband was the same way. So I started saying, ‚ÄúOK, well I‚Äôm gonna go anyway. Enjoy your evening.‚Äù  

He finally got the point that I just wanted to spend alone time with him. "
"When I changed jobs, one of the woman at work who trained me told gave me a dressing down.

‚ÄúGirl, you need to polish that spine.‚Äù

This of course was *after* that fuckhead was illegally elected president and years of being treated poorly at my last job. It‚Äôs worked. I don‚Äôt let people shit on me anymore. "
In this position right now :/  it‚Äôs gotten to the point where if I wasn‚Äôt pregnant I would just leave. But I am and I definitely can‚Äôt do it on my own so I stay üòÖ
"My dad is a lot like this as well. My mom LOVES flowers, but he doesn't often get them for her. She often buys them herself, but ever since my siblings and I were old enough to, we just buy my mom's flowers to pick up my dad's slack. If I'm going to visit, I often just buy flowers for my mom anyway because I also like them but am too cheap to buy them for myself. "
"Honestly, you sound like you are in better financial/life shape than most people I know, but I know you had to work for it at all times, often the hard way, and you weren't doing it for yourself, but likely for your kids.

I have a bunch of friends in the sex industry and they all work so damn hard in their respective trade, and have to deal with so much more than the rest of us in vanilla jobs, so kudo's to you."
Just using the term ‚Äúgay‚Äù in that context is more offensive than his unwillingness to put forward any affectionate gesture.
"Honestly, if you‚Äôre self aware enough to ask this question, you may not be ‚Äúthat guy.‚Äù Just in case though, read body language. If she‚Äôs pulling, turning, shying away...that‚Äôs that."
"1) have a common interest
2) make it clear you are in no way dtf."
"I'm white and my boyfriend is mixed (half black/half white).

One thing I learned from him is that racial identity is fluid. I never realized that people of mixed backgrounds identify themselves differently even day to day. We were in a foreign restaurant and he joked that we're ""the annoying white people"". Or the next day he might say he's the one black guy in a group. And another day he may refer to himself as mixed. 

He looks clearly half and half, so people always refer to him as different things as well. He's told me he never fully fit in with either community. I told him that it's okay because he can choose both."
"My husband and I just started a new TV-watching thing where we each chose one show we like that we'd like the other to watch. The shows are of similar length (episode and season number-wise), and we watch them back-to-back on a regular basis. I chose Lost, he chose Xena. It's been a lot of fun, actually, and I totally recommend other couples try it out!"
"I feel the same way. Fun fact, in countries/states where prostitution is legal, human trafficking rates skyrocket. So I can't help but gag whenever someone starts frothing at the mouth about how it should be legalized. Even in places where pimping was illegal but prostitution was. [Here's](https://orgs.law.harvard.edu/lids/2014/06/12/does-legalized-prostitution-increase-human-trafficking/) an article by Harvard discussing it."
Lol I think he‚Äôs asking what it is
"I hated that Dove campaign where they magnanimously declared slightly less photoshopped-than-usual people to be worthy of buying their grocery store soap too. Talk about patronizing. 

Also, I‚Äôm amazed that ‚Äúhusband is a bumbling chump who can‚Äôt find his own ass with two hands, and wife has to keep the entire household running‚Äù is still such a popular trope in commercials in 2019. If nothing else, you‚Äôd think male consumers would get sick of being treated as complete idiots at some point. He may be a 35-year-old father of three with a beautiful house, but he‚Äôs never figured out how to clean a toilet or make a sandwich? Give me a fucking break. "
"I don't like the trend in remaking movies with female-led casts. I know it gets lionised in feminist circles, but I don't enjoy the movies. I didn't like Ghostbusters or Ocean's 8. I prefer newe female-led stories, rather than just jamming women into an already existing story. "
"I tell my wife I have 3 favorite foods and they all start with p, pizza, pasta, and *you know* üòÅ"
"The trial and error aspect. Makeup/skincare products are expensive, when I buy a foundation that dries a different color than my skin, or a face lotion that‚Äôs the equivalent of water, it makes me irate üòÇ"
"I think calling a movie a chick flick and calling it feminist are different things. Chick flick implies is is a movie made for women that only women will like (which has it's own issues). A feminist movie, to me, implies it's a movie with a message like ""women can be Ghostbusters, too."" 

And when people think a movie is supposed to have a message, they dissect it. Look at this feminist movie where a woman general hits a man subbordante. See how all feminist hate men and even promote violence against them! But if it was just a movie, that general just becomes a flawed character who unecessarily abuses those under her."
"Especially when it's something of his (phone/keys/wallet)
How would I know? "
Put some clean clothes on. Care about his appearance. He doesn't want me to mother him but also doesnt want to think about putting his jeans in the wash and buying a new jumper when he needs one. 
If he would learn to cook more than sandwiches.
Always wanted to hang out at 3 AM. Took me a little too long to realize there‚Äôs a name for that. 
I think you keep choosing *convenient* people.
"My partner (we've been together 8 years) constantly asks me for chapstick.  I give him my chapstick, I never see it again. I bought him his own chapstick.  I got designated ""bathroom"" chapstick.  Somewhere in our house is a magical pile of brand new chapsticks that have been used once.  I got so tired of this that I gave him a tub of Vaseline the last time he asked for chapstick.  He has since stopped asking."
"I only cut people from my life if they are toxic without wanting to improve anything about themselves or unwilling to at least try and get better with how they treat others.

I feel sorry for them, because I know they're probably dealing with a lot inside, but, I cannot sacrifice my own sanity and happiness to appease them."
"Needing constant validation and love from others, especially from the same gender of the SO. In my case, it lead to infidelity as it only took attention from another woman to make poor choices.

Obviously other character traits beyond the insecurity played into it as well, but it‚Äôs one that impacts relationships."
Me too. I lost 12lbs over the holidays just by eating at home. Despite the massive quantities of alcohol i was consumed. I think I'm going to keep it going by moving my ass some more. 
"Yeah, I dated short guys (all around 5'5"") from ages 14 till 29. Even married one! Kind of weird that they all had that terrible narcissistic Napoleon complex thing going on. The guy I married was incredibly abusive both mentally and physically to me because of this. Of course I'm not saying *all short guys*, but just *all guys I dated for 15 years of my life* shared this exact same set of traits. For all we know, it could just be because of unfortunate unluck on my part. The scary thing about dating a narcissist is that they lure you in with a mask on making them appear to be amazing, sweet, funny, and caring until you let your guard down and it's too late. "

"Tbh, I don‚Äôt remember exactly how I got started, but I remember my bf reading an article about used panty vending machines in Japan. We laughed and kind of chastised the idea of someone selling or buying used panties but then it turned into ‚Äúwell... it‚Äôs not that bad of an idea.. and everyone has their ‚Äòthing‚Äù.‚Äù Initially, i was on another anonymous site putting out feelers for potential buyers, and had a little luck there. The Reddit gig has gone really well for me. I‚Äôve pretty much worn panties the past 8 days for customers, and am booked out til the 26th. To get started just post on r/usedpanties and the rest will take care of itself ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Not really, no. My moms had a talk with me and said she'd rather I didn't go out and get messed up, but that she didn't want me hiding things from her so it was my job to be responsible. If anything went south, she always reassured me she'd be there no questions asked. I never did sneak out of my house because there was no reason to."
"I saw one one that started out by listing his mental health issues, went right into calling all women flakes and fakes and finished with him blaming his unemployment on Obama. I did not reply to his message. 

I also saw one that started out good but then started talking about how much he missed his late wife and it was just so clear he was not over her and was not ready to date. It was sad and I had sympathy for him but his profile was a giant red flag. "
"She is tired. (Had to, haha)"
"So I didn‚Äôt realize this was my type until I started dating the guy I am now. He‚Äôs twice my size and ridiculously strong. When I first saw him I figured he was a Jarhead who was going to be a hard Ass.  But the moment I got to know him he broke all those judgments I had made. He‚Äôs kind sweet gentle and very patient. He‚Äôs also a giant nerd just like I am, and he also loves spending time in nature. It‚Äôs a huge turn on to see just a rough looking man melt at the sight of a puppy or look at me and say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay we‚Äôll go at your speed.‚Äù I don‚Äôt want to date anyone else after this one, he‚Äôs perfect. "
