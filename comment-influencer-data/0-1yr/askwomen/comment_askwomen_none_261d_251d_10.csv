"Factoring in my period when planning events, e.g. wedding day, camping trips, kayaking adventures, etc."
Panic when they sneeze during their period.
"Taking an Uber or Lyft alone.

I had a driver hit on me the whole ride home. I ignored him and shut it down. When we got to my apartment complex, he started asking where my boyfriend was (I never mentioned one, I think it was his way of seeing if I was single). He asked me which building was mine, and why I wasn't inviting him inside. He even got out of his car and walked slightly behind me as I was trying to get inside.

I didn't know what to do, so I just walked right past my building so he wouldn't know where I lived. I had some friends a few buildings down, so I planned on ringing their doorbell.

He eventually gave up and went back to his car, but I will never do another ride share alone. "
Debating the necessity of shaving my legs for specific events.
I have given birth to way too many jellyfish.
Wearing moisturizer and sunscreen. I literally did not take either seriously until I started looking really old compared to my peers. Now I'm obsessed with both but really wish I had started using in my teens-20s instead of late 20s-early 30s. There is some damage that can't be reversed.
Planning out which days to wash my hair so it aligns with my schedule.
"Feeling a little bit of dread when you have a DM from a stranger, because you know opening it is basically disappointing penis roulette."
"My ex bf once told me I shower so hot because I feel homesick for hell, thanks, hun."
"Don't brush your wavy-curly hair when it's dry if you don't want huge poofy hair. I was under the impression you had to brush your hair in the morning to look put together, but now I only detangle when it's soaked in conditioner and it looks much better. "
Books where women are incredibly aware of what their boobs are doing and how they feel all the time....
"We use SO MUCH toilet paper, especially on our periods."
"I'm prepared for things/have it in my purse.

Spare phone charger? FitBit charger? Ibuprofen? Naproxen? Lactase pills? Sewing kit? Tampons? Pens? Sticky notes? Battery pack? Checkbook?  Stamps? Chapstick? Some days it's just impressive and I'm like a goddamn Mary Poppins, y'all!"
"Hair gets thinner with age, meaning that for many women having long hair can actually make them appear more aged than short hair does. And also long hair takes a lot more maintenance which many older women simply don‚Äôt want to be bothered with anymore. Plus, many women with greying hair want to dye it, and coloring short hair is *way* cheaper.

Edit: also there‚Äôs probably something to be said about menopausal hot flashes and long hair üòÇ"
"Ugh yes I hate that. Mine seems to manage to appear on Christmas, my anniversary, my birthday and any holidays we take no matter how I plan. "
"A lot of things related to grooming.  The extent to which many of us deal with body hair, rough skin, hair- and skincare, makeup, nails, etc.  Like it's a meme that women's bathrooms are a mess of random products, but I don't think many men actually think about the time and effort put into actually *using* those products.  They just take it for granted that women's bodies are naturally smooth and soft and pretty."
"I posted this somewhere else, but it‚Äôs worth mentioning: take your clothes to get tailored. I bought a dress at target for $20 and it looked nice, I tailored it to myself and now it gives me that WOW factor. It‚Äôs very easy to learn how to sew and tailor clothes. I took like 3 classes at Joann‚Äôs Fabrics and it was such a great investment. "
"That you have to PRACTICE these things. Makeup skills aren't inborn. And women's hair doesn't naturally fall in perfect waves and curls.

Also, you don't have to completely do your hair and makeup every morning. My Mom had an hour long bathroom routine and I always thought it was ridiculous and hated the idea that I'd have to do that once I became a ""working adult""."
"Remove hair from our our belly, around our nipples, upper lip hair... not just pubic/armpit/leg hair"
"The worst is when you don‚Äôt even cough or sneeze, it just decides to slide out right while you‚Äôre in conversation with someone and you have to keep a straight face üò©"

"My exhusband and I were in marriage counseling and the counselor asked him directly, ""Do you love your wife?"" He paused a long moment and replied, ""Well... sometimes I'm proud of her looks."" 

I wanted to die after hearing that but it snapped my resolve to make the marriage work- why bother with any of the misery for someone who doesn't even care about you? He never did understand why that was not a good answer. "
Books where the female characters never interact with each other or it‚Äôs always negative/catty/competitive. 
"I like the idea of the opposite of this;  
  
""As he walked down the street, his balls jiggled tasticularly, and his penis flopped like a long, fat sausage.""  
  
edit: Your silver has brought me an incredible sense of sturdy, smug satisfaction."
"I make sure to never leave a drink unattended at a bar, even if it's a really uncrowded or laid-back seeming bar. It's second nature. I don't think many men think about this much. Once at a bar with my boyfriend I got up to go to the bathroom and when I came back, I realized he had also gone to the bathroom, and left both our drinks on the table. I had to remind him to please not do that when he's out with me."
"Planning my periods/birth control around important events and vacation, making sure I never leave the house without at least one menstrual pad and 1-2 doses of painkiller in my bag, trying not to forget to shave my arms/legs etc if I hadn't worn shorts/short sleeves in a while - and then because I'm someone with PCOS (hormonal issues, one of the symptoms is excessive hair growth) making sure there's no missed dark hairs on my chin/neck "

They almost always bring up the nipples or breast size in the first few chapters. 
Change the hand towel in the bathroom. 
"My husband and I were getting a little touchy feely the other day in the morning and I noticed him take a second longer glancing at my boobs, but not in a ""Oh yeeesss"" kind of way but more of a ""Wtf?"" kind of way. 

Afterwards he says ""Don't shave your nipples anymore, I'll help you tweeze them if you want.""

I'm still not sure how I feel about this interaction days later."
"Peeing right after sex so you don‚Äôt get a UTI. 

Bringing a change of underwear if you‚Äôre going to sleep over at someone‚Äôs house bc you literally need to change your underwear after sexy time. 

Touching a goddaman clitorous!! 

Hmm...what else? Trying to take the dick out in the right way so it doesn‚Äôt make a fart sound. 

Get implants in their arms or metal rods put in their uterus so they don‚Äôt have babies."
I finally realized i was becoming the toxic person in the relationship and needed to work on my own being after weeks of snapping and being rude to him for very silly things that i didn‚Äôt need to react over 
"When I accidentally found a bunch of creepy saved photos of one of my best friends saved on his laptop. Some were her social media photos, some were candid from when she was visiting me. The worse were the ones of us swimming- because he wasn't even supposed to be home that day. Which means he creeped in the hedges and spied on us. Informed her, packed up my stuff and was out that same day üëã"
"I didn't realize you had to clean your makeup brushes until I was in my late twenties. Fortunately my skin never suffered, but I felt disgusting when I realized.  At least it was satisfying to wash off years of old eyeshadow. "
Even when I‚Äôm not on my period. ‚ÄúIs it my period coming? Is it cum from last night? Is it just a big globe of discharge? Must go to the bathroom soon and find out.‚Äù
I know it‚Äôs bad for my skin but I will never give up my hellfire showers.
"When he drove past me while I was stopped at a red light not 30 seconds after texting me that he was working late again. He made eye contact with me and everything but didn‚Äôt care that he‚Äôd been caught lying again. So I went home, packed my stuff, and left with our dog. 


Edited to add context: 
I said our dog because that‚Äôs what we referred to her as. I bought her myself when I was still living with my parents, I paid for all vet care, and I paid for all of her every day needs like food, grooming, etc. In every way that matters she was and is my dog. 

After I moved out that night we never spoke again. I was told by a mutual friend that he was quite happy about it because it was annoying him to have to hide his secret drug habit. I knew he smoked pot but he had gotten into harder stuff and I was blissfully unaware. Working late meant buying drugs and using with a friend and some girl they were both involved with. So I got myself tested and moved on with my life while he‚Äôs been in and out of jail ever since. No regrets here!"
"the ""badass"" asian with the single highlight of purple or blue hair (like that girl in big hero 6, or in comic books)

honestly i think that's the only one ive seen of the asian women in american media (since they rarely show them at all, not much to go by). i was trying to think of the ""subservant women"" one but i couldnt actually come up with an example of that in the media since there arent really stories about asian women where we would even see them in this context. i guess in war movies or period pieces?

"All the girls in ‚ÄúSpring Breakers‚Äù ... written by Harmony Korine. There‚Äôs something unsettling about a middle aged guy writing through the eyes of college girls. Vanessa Hudgen‚Äôs character says, ‚ÄúSeeing all this money makes my pussy wet‚Äù. "
"I was on a beach vacation with a guy I was seeing and didn‚Äôt bring a razor since airport security usually confiscates them. One night in bed I noticed my armpits were getting hairy and he asked why I didn‚Äôt pick up a razor at the drugstore the night before. I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I guess I wasn‚Äôt thinking about my armpits last night. Were you thinking about your armpits last night?‚Äù and his mind was blown that things like hair removal that seem to happen effortlessly behind the scenes require actual conscious thought and preparation...


He is relatively hairless though so I‚Äôm assuming  this would be less of a revelation for men who have to groom their own bodies more frequently. 

[Edited for word choice]"
"Pretty much whenever I see a female love interest with absolutely NO flaws, or her flaws are literally just 'I'm so kooky! Sometimes I talk to my dog like it's a person!' There are so many instances of this I can't even begin to list off movies/tv/books. Female writers do this too with regards to men, don't get me wrong, but it seems to be a much bigger epidemic with male writers."
think about how a person you're rejecting might rape and/or kill you 
"Being told how you're so small and delicate that he could just 'break you in half'. I once had a guy actually put his hands on my neck and say ""wow, I could probably just snap your neck!"". Um, go away.

I'm assuming men don't do that to other men."
"I had a professor tell a story about a student whose feet smelled and he couldn't figure out why, and the prof jokingly asked him if he washed the bottom of his feet, and it turns out he didn't; once he started doing so, his odor problem apparently went away. Welp, everyone laughed, and silently I realized that up until that point, I'd never bothered to actively wash the bottom of my feet in the shower. I always just figured the soapy water did enough. I still think it does honestly, but yeah, I give em a little once over with the loofah, and they're much softer now."
Worry about being pregnant even if you didn‚Äôt have sex that month. 
"Omg I think I look great after crying (sometimes) my eyelashes look longer because they‚Äôre wet, my cheeks &amp; nose are rosy/flushed, my hair is sort of messy. My other friends absolutely detest going out after crying but I feel like I look alright enough!"
Or be paranoid about sitting in a light colored chair.
"Living with parents. Most people I know my age are still in that position, it's expensive here.

Bisexuality, a lot of people have a thing about that. "
"The ""tiger mom"". I am so sick of the ""tiger mom"" stereotype. There are strict Asian moms, there are cool Asian moms, there are Asian moms of every variety. I'm going to be an Asian mom someday, and if somebody calls me a tiger mom, I will not be happy."
"Emotionally abusive, yes.  At the time, I just knew I felt awful, and eventually decided that even if he was right, even if I were lazy and unattractive, I still didn't have to stick around and listen to him tell me about it.  There was no last straw, just a slowly growing realization that other relationships weren't like this, that I wasn't required to stick around.  "
When a girl told me she slept with him and I didn't care. The best part was she was angry that I didn't care.
Baldness. My SO‚Äôs hairline was thinning at a rapid rate so he made the brave decision to shave it totally. I love his bald peanut.
I like wearing baggy layers (especially long skirts and long jumpers) and looking like I‚Äôve drowned myself in fabric. Though mostly I‚Äôm too lazy and poor and just wear leggings and a shirt/jumper.
"It may sound really small but my dad apologized to me. He has never done it before, ever. He said something really mean and all my life, it's always been us kids(my mom doesnt allow him to do this to her) letting things that he said go, just to keep the peace. I no longer live at home so i just said no more and havent spoken to or seen him for over 2 months now. He came to my house the day before christmas and apologized, actually said im sorry and he went into detail about what he was sorry about. It wasnt just me. He went to my siblings separately and apologized for past things he said and i didnt know until i spoke to them. My dad's the most hardheaded person and i dont know what changed but for him to do that-yea, that was just the best present. I missed him and hopefully, he keeps this up.

Edit: Thanks for the silver"
"When he broke through the bathroom door because I brought my cell phone with me. Fuck you, asshole. "
"I am the mom-friend and used to be room mates/best friends with a mom-friend. I enjoy the role most days. I‚Äôve taken home drunks, I‚Äôve been the voice of reason, I‚Äôve talked people down from ledges, but there are days I wish one of those friends could reverse the role for me. Most aren‚Äôt willing to take care of the mom-friend or maybe refuse to believe that I could benefit from their support sometimes."
"When I moved in with my boyfriend, he made a comment on how quickly we were going through toilet paper. I've always made it a point to use as little as possible, but the look on his face when I reminded him that I need to use it for all of my trips to the toilet seemed like that really just never occurred to him. He's learning about living with a woman, trying to go easy on him lol"
"Harem pants. 

My friend who is fashionable commented on them by saying ""you look... comfortable"" lol

"oh yeah I‚Äôve been out with guys who gave me weird looks when I chugged my drink before going to the bathroom... they didn‚Äôt understand why I wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable leaving it unattended. 

also the guys who don‚Äôt understand why you can‚Äôt just go for a solitary stroll after dark. I got hungry in the middle of the night but there was no food available, my ex was like ‚Äújust walk to the corner store‚Äù (almost a kilometer away), he called me paranoid and childish for not wanting to take a midnight stroll by myself in a small town with inadequate lighting. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ‚Äúbut whenever I go out with you, I never witness you getting any harassment!‚Äù  yes... that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm out with a man, not by myself, dumbass.

"Jonathan Franzen's female characters in his novel Freedom, especially Patty, the main narrator. I couldn't get through the book because of how flat and one-dimensional and irredeemable she is written to be. His male characters have depth, so it's not that he's a bad writer. The way he constructs the female characters leads me to feel like he's never really taken the time to listen to any women before trying to write from the point of view of one. "
"Flossing, I was never taught to fucking floss. "
Height. It's stupid and superficial. It's just like I wouldn't want someone to choose not to date me because of my boob size.

"It was about the 5th or more time I'd tried to break up with him in our 2 years together, and when he started crying, I felt more annoyed than moved.

He was an actor and could cry on cue, so he used that trick to manipulate me throughout our relationship. It worked pretty well because my family is quite stoic, and I'm not a crier myself. The first times, I was really touched that he was so sensitive and so willing to be vulnerable in front of me. But by the end I'd finally seen through it, and when he started to sob my first thought was, ""Ugh, not again."" "
I'm conflicted for you...
"Honestly, next time someone asks me why I shower so hot, this is what I'm going to tell them."
"Clean the bathroom. /s

"Soft bristle toothbrushes, like the ones you get after oral surgery. My pediatric dentists would always tell me and my parents ""She's such a good brusher! Any toothbrush will work!"" But children's toothbrushes are softer than normal adult toothbrushes and my ""good brushing"" soon caused my gums to start receding. One dentist just told me that I was brushing too hard, but I didn't feel like I was getting a good clean around my gums. After having oral surgery, the super soft bristle brushes have been an absolute game changer and my current dentist has commented on how my gums are clean and healthy."
Conditioner. Life changing. My parents never had conditioner growing up. They now keep it in the guest bathroom after I kept leaving bottles.

I had a cab drop me off four blocks from my house because the cabdriver was being a creep. Which didn‚Äôt vastly improve my situation because then I had to walk four blocks in the dark on Detroit‚Äôs east side. Not a decision I was prepared to make that night.

Once seen, respond accordingly: usually with platonic dancing to pull her away from the creepy dude and into your larger group of people until the dude has walked away. 

That, and asking in any public restroom if someone has a tampon. We‚Äôve all been unexpectedly caught without, and will all return the favor someday.

"It gets to 110¬∞F here regularly in the summer, if I'm just running errands flip flops are a perfectly valid choice of footwear"
"My SO is from India and comes from a emotionally and physically abusive household. He loves my Dad, he thinks he‚Äôs a really cool guy and although he‚Äôs never said it, I know it‚Äôs because he sees the way my Dad and I are together and I think he longs for that. My Dad is my best friend, my biggest cheerleader, and he never gave up on me when I was doing shitty things in active addiction. 
So, last time we were all together before Christmas, we were leaving and my Dad shook my SO‚Äôs hand. We got in the car and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúone day I‚Äôll get a hug.‚Äù Christmas came, he had a great time celebrating his 2nd Christmas. We were leaving and my Dad went to shake his hand, and then stretched his other hand out to give him a hug. My boyfriend made a little squeal (he now regrets that noise) and they hugged for like 30 seconds. It‚Äôs like I could feel the happiness radiating off of them.
We got back in the car, and my SO got really quiet and whispered, ‚Äúmy Dad has never hugged me...not my entire life.‚Äù I actually started crying, told him I was proud of him daily and that I loved him. He cried and thanked me for letting him into my family.
It brings me great joy that he now has my family to love him, I know it won‚Äôt make up for the 23 years of loneliness, but this is a good start to a happy future!


I wish you the best in the new year, I‚Äôm sorry your Christmas was bad. I understand. I was in rehab 2 Christmas‚Äô ago and I felt horrible. I hope the comments here put a smile on your face. Good luck from the bottom of my heart! 


TLDR : Best gift for my SO was a hug from my Dad!"
"It took me until I was 21 to use makeup brushes instead of just a sponge/fingers.

He slapped my cat so hard she fell off the chair. Fuck that guy. 
"I looked at the top posts on that sub and the second one is a ‚Äúhow to spot the male writer‚Äù joke thing, and a response to that was ‚ÄúPadme went for Anakin when Ewan MacGregor was around‚Äù and I‚Äôm just dying laughing now. "

"Most women‚Äôs hair becomes brittle, frail, and thin as they age and cutting it short can make it look healthier and fuller. It also may just not grow past that point. Some women at the salon I work at say they feel a short cut is more flattering to their aging facial features."
"He was on a trip for like 2 weeks and we barely spoke or texted, and I found that I just really didn't miss him much. The sex had stopped, we were kind of in an argument loop where we just rehashed the same stuff, and we were firmly in roommate mode. 

Still took a while longer to get to the breakup, but that was when I started actually picturing what my life was going to look like post-breakup."
"I like wearing clothes out of season, not on purpose but just because it's what I feel like wearing. Sweatshirt in summer, tank top in winter, white after whatever day you're not supposed to ect."
I started doing this when I was a teenager and my mom suggested I should. She says she regretted not wearing sunscreen everyday and now she spends tons on creams to try to reverse the damage and wrinkles. Thanks mom! 
"My husband stopped at the grocery store and picked up a bag of Halloween candy for the trick-or-treaters. I ugly-cried because it sounded like fun and I wanted to buy it with him. 

I just kept repeating ""why would you do that without me?"" And ""I don't know why I'm crying,"" over and over again. "
"For the most part, thank-you and host/hostess gifts. (I gave a thank-you present to a guy friend, and while I could tell he appreciated it, he looked at me like I had just stepped off a spaceship.) Guys just aren't socialized or expected to give those kinda gifts. "
"My ex was incredibly manipulative, but SO subtle about it that neither I nor anyone else realized it.  It wasn‚Äôt until after he cheated and left that I started analyzing the last decade with him without the rose colored glasses and realized all the ways he had slowly manipulated me over that time.  By the time he‚Äôd left me, my self esteem was almost nonexistent and I was a shell of a person.  It took a lot of work to become the strong person I am now, but no one can manipulate me now!  I see manipulative behavior of all kinds coming from a mile away, including my ex who still tries, and I drop those people pretty fast.  Never again.  "
"I'm the only woman in my family who has curly hair. My dad does, but he has always kept his hair very short. No one in my family has ever learnt how to care for curly hair. I was always told to brush it because it looked wild. In all of my photos as a child I have wild, frizzy hair. As such, as an adult I always had my hair tied up and loaded with hairspray.

I have learnt so much about my own hair. Now I have very pretty curly hair, its healthy and I wear it down. I get many compliments and I happily threw my hairbrush out completely. Sadly, neither of my children got my curly hair, so i still stick out like a sore thumb in family photos. Thank god for YouTube tutorials! "
"Wearing foundation. I honestly thought as a teen that everyone else had perfect complexion and it was just me in the corner suffering from acne and blotchy skin. Not that I wear foundation much anymore. 

Skincare also. I've really tackled skincare and  have much better skin. But hormones and lack of support at home to being told so simply ""just wash your face!"" wasn't really helpful. I had to do a lot of work, trial and error as well to figure out the best skincare routine for my skin.

I think getting older and out of the hormonal teenage years also helped. But I feel like I was completely lost with skincare and beauty care in general.

"When I was in a car crash years ago my psychical therapist was this strong independent extraordinary woman, that was my moms age or a few years older. 

She always came with high spirits trying to make me smile, or laugh.

I was in a very bad place mentally, I had just lost my hearing, my future career, and had suicidal thoughts everyday. Physical therapy was hell too! 

It hurt so much, and she knew, but she was so full of empathy, not sympathy or pity, that I (an introvert) feel like I could talk about everything to her.

Later I (years later) learned she had lost his son 5 years ago to a degenerative disease. And she came in high spirits (apparently) every day to say her witty things to me to try to cheer me up or crack a smile.

Her husband left her when they discovered one of their 2 sons has a degenerative illness that would progress to death in his teenage years. 

So she had to raise, care for and be the rock of her little family alone. Her teenage child died in her arms.

 And she keep only giving and giving... 

After everything with me was done, we would meet once a month to drink some coffee and have a walk, and just talk or vent.

 It's been 11 Years now. She's 65, and one of my best friends ever. I love you Elena! "

"Remember when he tried to write a character who felt sensitive about judgment or ostracization from the rest of the community because she and her family were Jewish?

"Similarly, how your cycle will affect your workout schedule. I took a pill for two years where I had no period and no PMS symptoms. It was damn insane! I was so constant and predictable with my workouts. But once I got off the pill, the changes were drastic. Some days, I have what feels like 0 gas in the tank‚Äîjust no energy at all. Or i will get cramps. Or nausea. Or back pain. Every week during the cycle is so different and it‚Äôs kind of infuriating to me how normal it is to work out when you don‚Äôt get a period. "
"My favorite is the glob of mucus that tells you you're ovulating. 

Edit: I'm glad I could enlighten some women today. That's the mucus plug sloughing off of your cervix to allow sperm into the uterus. The mucus plug forms after your period when your uterus is building up the lining while it prepares to house an embryo. "
"I was reading a Nicholas Sparks book, where he wrote the female lead washed her hair right before coloring it. If you‚Äôve ever colored your hair, you would know this is unnecessary and even a waste of time. You wash it to wash the color out. It didn‚Äôt make reading the book less enjoyable.

"When he stopped wanting to hang out with me. Towards the end he treated me like it was a chore to have to talk to me or plan things with me. Pushed me out of conversations with our friends (maybe not intentionally?) and ignored me a lot.

It makes the person feel like there's no point caring about your trust because you only believe the fears your anxiety feeds you rather than actual evidence that a person is trustworthy. Try to put yourself in their shoes...how would you feel if someone you loved didn't trust you?

Also breaking down the notion that if someone you trust hurts you then it's your fault. It isn't. They're the one who did the wrong thing. 

(Edit for typos and a small addition)"
If it doesn't feel like I'm bathing directly in the flames of the sun then I don't want it. This is a good tip though and I do feel slightly bad for my skin and hair.
"You do not have to wash your hair every day.  
I have super thick, crazy hair, and it was always a dang mess, until I learned that going a few days between washes was not only okay, it was beneficial.  I have not had an issue with itchy scalp since, and my hair is flipping fabulous.  My hairdresser always raves about how I have one of the healthiest heads of hair she has ever worked with."
"How to seem aloof enough to not attract unwanted attention, but not too angry looking, to attract a bad person looking for a reason to harass a woman."
"Used to think education, he had to be as educated as me or more. Have realised that that‚Äôs not always necessary and a guy with less education can be great and even better than their more educated counterparts."
Personally I realized it's not worth the hassle.

"I forgot to buy blueberries when I was at the grocery store and told my bf. The next day, he had to go to the grocery store after work and he bought some. When i opened the fridge and saw the blueberries, realized that he had remembered that I wanted blueberries I started crying... "
"Also, never let a random buy you a drink unless you go up to the bar with them and watch the bartender make it. There‚Äôs a club in downtown Seattle that was busted for tons of shit, one being the bartenders putting roofies in girls drinks. I ended up being a victim because I didn‚Äôt follow the random up to the bar and he returned with a vodka cran with a side of roofie. Ouch. "
"I was having a really shit day at work today, we were busier than expected and understaffed, and I was working alongside a manager that I don‚Äôt have a lot of respect for. It was also super hot in the store &amp; when I get hot I get sooooo bothered lol so not really ideal 

But I was cashing out this lady, and said my standard ‚Äúhey how are you‚Äù and she looked at me and she said ‚Äúi am so great! Isn‚Äôt it a beautiful day? Did you have a good Christmas?‚Äù 

Now half the time I say hello I don‚Äôt even get a nod in response so I was already like...wow! 

And she said she‚Äôs in town to visit family for Christmas, she‚Äôs leaving tomorrow to have the new year with her friends. But she just kept saying ‚Äúisn‚Äôt it such a beautiful day? Isn‚Äôt this a great way to end the year?‚Äù 

And honestly it isn‚Äôt every day you come across such a genuinely grateful person who shares their joy so openly, it really reminds me of the type of person I want to be and the mentality I strive to have. I really hang on to these little blessings when times get tough, you know? Because today was overcast and windy, but it was a beautiful day because she thought so and shared it with me"
"Whenever I tell someone I have a mustache and excessive dark chin hairs (because of PCOS) they're always like ""Wow really? I can't see anything!!"" Uh yeah, that's because I spend time bleaching and plucking my face daily so you DON'T see anything. "
"Being ""boring"" as in not wanting to go to clubs, discos, bars and such. (Common dealbreaker when youre 22) 

I enjoy these things. I cant enjoy them often because they tire me out. I dont care or even prefer if they arent party people."
I usually go without makeup. 
This! That was sexual harassment and inappropriate in many ways. That guy should lose his job. 
I couldn‚Äôt even make it through all of this movie. It‚Äôs a laughable mix between a funky indie movie and a teen incel‚Äôs wet dream. 
Repeating outfits. I have a large wardrobe but have about three fail-safe outfits I go to when everything else looks stupid on me. I don‚Äôt care if my friends have seen it before. My boyfriend doesn‚Äôt care. I look good and stylish and feel great. Don‚Äôt understand the taboo behind this. 
"I drove Uber/Lyft for like a solid two months, can‚Äôt tell you how many young women I picked up who were so happy just to see another young female face. But sadly driving for ride share is actually a lot more scary as a female than I‚Äôve ever felt as a rider."
"My mom prides herself on not being a ""girly girl"" (which is nonsense) and therefore I missed a lot of these things. 


-conditioner, as many have mentioned

-not washing my long, curly hair every day

-hair serum to help with dry, curly hair in no wash days

-pumice stones for the cracks on my feet, followed by some Vaseline and heavy socks (my feet will crack and bleed if I don't do this a few times a week)

-hand cream (I have no idea why this wasn't considered normal for my mom, the cracks on her finger tips are so painful. If I skip this in winter I end up with bleeding fingertips by the end of the day)

Edit:spelling

Edit 2: weird phrasing of the hair washing comment is causing confusion. I meant that as a kid my mom would have me wash my hair each day which is VERY BAD for curly hair, and now I do not wash it every day, usually just once or twice a week and have seen a huge improvement "
Doesn't he know that's when the phone is most important. 
"I have never taken an Uber or a Lyft alone and some of my male friends are so perplexed by the lengths I‚Äôll go to make sure I can easily get myself home safely at the end of the night. I have no desire to ride in a stranger‚Äôs car alone. I wish female riders could request female drivers only ( If that‚Äôs a thing already, please let me know!) "
So true! And anxiety if we don't have our purse with supplies. Inevitably someone needs a bandaid or kleenex the ONE time we don't have it.
"That we're easy smh. I'm always getting hit on by older white men (60+) cause they think they have a chance. It's like dude, I don't need a green card or a sugar daddy and i don't love you long time, mmkay bye."
"There's a lot of interesting scholarship on the binary portrayal of Asian women in the media, whether it's the hypersexualized martial artist or the mute geek completely devoid of any sexual qualities. As an East-Asian woman, I'd personally like to see more NON-East-Asian women represented in this category that we call ""Asian women."" Most of the ""Asian female actresses"" that I can think of off the top of my head (Sandra Oh, Brenda Song, Kelly Hu, Lana Condor, Jamie Chung, Lucy Liu, etc) already fit a certain mold; usually light-skinned and petite East-Asian women. I think the discussion following the film Crazy Rich Asians demonstrated a hunger for not just MORE, but BETTER representation of Asian folx."
"I noticed that drying my hair seems to be taking longer and longer. (It's not actually taking a longer time, just feels that way.) I *totally* understand the lower maintenance styles that older women have. I'm only 31 and already I'm almost at that point of ""Fuck it... Let's cut it off."" "
According to my husband- Clean the countertops and dining table when you do the dishes. Blows his mind.
"This is a bit of a tangent but in one these AskWomen threads about disgusting women behaviors, someone posted that they lick their eyeshadow brushes to wet them before applying eyeshadow. I read a lot of those threads and even the stuff about periods and poop don't bother me as much as that one comment did."
"I recently saw the movie *Red Sparrow*. It‚Äôs already god-awful for *so many* reasons, but the kicker for me was that at one point Jennifer Lawrence‚Äôs character dies her hair from dark brown to platinum blonde with one ONE BOX of store-bought hair dye! And no gloves.

Not only does it come out perfectly, but then she goes swimming in a chlorinated pool the very next scene.

"
"I caught him cheating again. I would have left him the first time but our daughter was still young. 

In retrospect, he was cheating to get me to break up with him. "
"If my husband invites anyone over for any reason, there's the unspoken expectation that I'll play hostess. My husband doesn't expect this, but the guests often do. 

For example, he once offered our house as a meeting place for a local civic group, and it was last minute so there wasn't much in the way of refreshments. One woman commented to me about the bottles of water not being chilled, and I said ""Talk to Hubby.... it's not my party."" (I was not a member of the civic group.)"
Actively worry about cameras planted in our public bathrooms and hotel rooms 
"when he told me that he wants to go to the festival we were supposed to go to together alone, because he wanted to ""finally"" have fun "
"I‚Äôve said it before: Aaron Sorkin makes great shows and he‚Äôs very intelligent, and a talented screenwriter, and his female characters are *laughable*. They are all essentially the exact same woman with different hair colours. "
wtf
Breasted boobily to the stairs is my favorite phrase 
"I thought I was gonna be the one spoiling my SO, but he one-upped me and proposed. Blew me away and damn am I excited for 2019!"
"I asked a bunch of my guy friends what the first thing they do when they get in their car is. They answered with things like ‚Äúput my seatbelt on‚Äù, ‚Äústart the car‚Äù, ‚Äúcheck my mirrors‚Äù, etc. I asked some of my girl friends the same thing and they all said ‚Äúlock the door‚Äù without fail.

In my experience, women think about safety first and everything else second. Historically, we‚Äôve been through too much to think otherwise."
"Most of them really. I also want to call attention to people in this thread saying ""he's a good writer, but his female characters suck."" Nah. If you can't write half the fucking human race, you're a shitty writer. If you can't do that because you can't think of women as people, you're a shitty person and a shitty writer."
"We were a year into couples therapy for the second time and I was trying to write out the reasons why I was frustrated and unhappy.  Trying to formulate the perfect expressions and find the right words that would make him understand, finally.   I thought the problem was that I hadn‚Äôt explained it properly, 

I saved it to Google Drive and then I realized there was a document I‚Äôd saved there over three years earlier expressing the exact same frustrations and exact same unhappiness.  Nothing had changed,  nothing I‚Äôd said in the interim had sunk in for him.  Not even with the help of the very experienced therapist.  Nothing was going to change three years from then.  

I started looking for apartments that night.  "
"The second time he hit me. The first time didn't leave a mark, it was ""light"", it was a ""heat of the moment accident"". The second time, I got real damn sick of being everyone's punching doll and knew I didn't have to take it from one more person than I had to. "
I left it where it was once as an experiment. It ultimately never was noticed by my husband for weeks despite the towel going off white...lol
"Actively work to get over the ways we are socialized to experience attraction to certain things and repulsion from other things. 

Yes, we grow up being told that a tall, handsome, thin, muscular, rich prince is out there for us. But most women actually choose to grow up and stop looking for these things in a partner. It takes WILL and WORK to learn to appreciate ‚Äòsocially undesirable‚Äô characteristics as part of a whole person, when society is constantly telling you certain things ‚Äî from fatness to shortness to hair loss ‚Äî make someone inferior and undesirable.

Yet almost every man seems to think his attraction to conventionally hot, thin/curvy, light-skinned, unblemished, not-smarter-than-him, not-more-successful-than-him women is an unalterable product of nature, rather than a product of social conditioning and entitlement. I have seen men have the verbal equivalent of toddler meltdowns when presented with the idea that they really *can* choose to develop attraction to members of their preferred gender(s) based on compatibility and genuinely important characteristics ‚Äî women do it all the time."
"If you keep your cuticles in check, you don't get as many hangnails. Always wondered why I constantly had hangnails growing up, and they hurt like a son-of-a-gun. Turns out I had no idea how to care for my cuticles. "
This is now how I will introduce all the badass male characters I write.
"Well, we were already in the ""we like each other"" phase and I was sitting with him while he was doing some math. (Slight deviation: he was using a ruler, and I got very impressed, because I hadn't seen those in forever and I thought it was classy, don't ask). He was telling me about a friend and how she was kinda struggling to confess to this guy and he asked me how I would do it. Being the most oblivious thing on this planet, I did not even see the hint and told him that I'd just come out and tell them that I love them. 
Him: ""But you tell your friends that you love them too"".
Me: ""True... I'd tell them that I love-love them""
Him: ""Listen, I love-love you""
Me:...
My stomach: *look at all these butterflies*
My palms: *look at all this sweat*
My heart: *I wanna sound like a running horse*
My face: *totally not blushing, nothing to worry about,        it's all chill (not)
Me: I love-love you too...
And that's when I knew that I really meant those words.

"
I heard a quote one time that I think is so true about women: we are supposed to work like we don't have kids and parent like we don't have a job. Sooooooo true.
My stepmom used to buy the 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner. I didn‚Äôt realize until I was an adult that it was so damaging for my hair. 
It was John Updike. He also says it's much easier for men to pee as they don't have an intricate maze.
Aha! People with straight hair always get totally weirded out when I say I don‚Äôt brush my hair. On occasion I have in front of them and then they understand why.
"YES.  Just social etiquette in general!!  I always have to ask, ‚Äúwhat do you think we should bring?‚Äù or suggest stopping along the way to pick up wine or cookies or SOMETHING.  He always thinks it‚Äôs too much but my mother raised me to never arrive empty-handed. 

When WE‚ÄôRE hosting, he likes to question things too, like ‚Äúare you sure we need that much beer?‚Äù Or ‚Äúno we don‚Äôt need more cups, we have enough from last time.‚Äù  No, I will not be the person who‚Äôs party falls flat because we ran out of drinks or because there weren‚Äôt enough cups for cocktails!!  That might just be his lack of event planning skills though lol"
"I liked Scott Westerfeld's Uglies series until the romantic competition for the dude. I've never met a girl who has turned on another girl over a guy, or was turned on. I'm sure it happens, but it's not a staple of women's existence as guys seem to think."
"My mother had an incurable degenerative disease so a lot of things I learned by watching others or Glamour magazine.

The one that makes me cringe the most is not washing my lady bits.  My mother was a teen mother (found this out after she passed) so our genitals were never discussed or acknowledged.  

One that I recently rectified is regular dentist visits.  My mom was sick and my dad was depressed, so they only did stuff where they were required.  I had my first dentist appointment in 20 years a year ago.  It took $2K and 5 appointments to get everything up to snuff."

It‚Äôs what the lord would have wanted. 
"Are you polyamorous or just a savage

I love denying people the attention/satisfaction of shit like that"
"Is it weird if it makes me happy to be asked for a tampon? It's like yes girl, I've been preparing for this moment! Hell yeah you can have a tampon! You need any ibuprofen?"
When I'm unhappy more than I'm happy. Relationships shouldn't make you miserable.
So much this! My step mom used to brush my hair dry and it would poof out terribly to the point where I thought my hair was just unmanageable and I would put it in a poofy ponytail constantly. Do you tend to take a comb through in shower then? 
"Honestly - I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had that moment. I do remember when I first saw him, and this is going to sound terribly cheesy, but everything literally happened in slow motion. It was from across a room at a very busy party, but I remember locking eyes with him at some point and it was just: ‚Äúoh, there you are‚Äù. It was this extremely weird feeling of familiarity and ever since then it‚Äôs never been a specific moment, it‚Äôs just been a series of waves of ‚Äúahhhh, I love this human. This is my person.‚Äù 

We‚Äôve been together for 3 years and 3 months now. He still gives me butterflies. I‚Äôm going to marry him someday. For suuuuuuure. "

"Mental illness. I have anxiety and depression. I don't judge other people who do. My SO has his own shit to deal with. Our brains are all weird, if you can take care of yourself, that's what matters to me."
"A therapist told me once, ‚Äúthe knowing part of you knows this isn‚Äôt healthy‚Äù and for some reason it really stuck with me. 

I knew it wasn‚Äôt normal, but didn‚Äôt realize the gravity until way later. His words are still in me, almost like a virus that is trapped inside my head. I catch myself sometimes with memories of things he said or did and I have a moment of ‚Äúoh, wait, that isn‚Äôt normal is it?‚Äù It‚Äôs gotten better but with like most things in life there are valleys and peaks.

"I heard someone say this a while ago, guys want a beautiful woman but don‚Äôt want them to spend the time getting ready. They thinks it‚Äôs annoying we spend an hour at the gym and an hour doing makeup, yet they want us to look flawless. It‚Äôs lose lose no matter what we do. "
His friend raped me and he helped cover up the assault to save his own arse rather than helping me (despite admitting the assault occurred).

"Steven King is the WORST with the constant boob mentions. I had to quit one of his books because of it. We get it, women have nipples! But no woman has ever ‚Äúconsidered her husband‚Äôs seed as it ran down her leg.‚Äù He‚Äôs a good writer but it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs never met a woman before. "
"Dean Koontz did this so much (maybe he still does but I haven‚Äôt read anything of his in like a decade).  The hero is always some Joe Schmoe, and the love interest is this perfect, gorgeous, smart, funny, unique, badass woman who loves him back AND gets along perfectly with his family."
Therapy helps
Spend a decent amount of the money on uber/Lyft in an attempt to get home safely as opposed to taking public transportation. 
"Most women in Murakami novels.

Norwegian Wood, for example. Beautiful book, but the women it is are basically a male fantasy. Here‚Äôs a male lead who‚Äôs dull and morose with seemingly no personality and somehow all these beautiful women fall in love with him and want to have sex with him. This girl who just lost her fianc√© exposes herself to him for no reason... You can‚Äôt help an internal eye roll at a lot of it. "
"Have concern over being raped at night, in parking lots, in elevators, by acquaintances, leaving bars or restaurants, for wearing revealing clothing, in their own homes because they left a window unlocked. The list goes on..."
"When he finally agreed to read the 5 Love Languages after months of fighting about it - my therapist had recommended we both read it since my ex refused to try couples therapy. As soon as he said it I was just filled with a sense of exhaustion and dread, like all the book would do was prolong our broken relationship. I felt a huge weight lift off my shoulders when we broke up less than a week later."
"I like my undereye circles and almost never conceal them even if I‚Äôm wearing foundation. I think it makes my eyes more prominent and gives some shape to my face. It‚Äôs completely alien to me that most beauty bloggers pack concealers and whiteners under their eyes. (TBH I don‚Äôt have very prominent circles, but they are darker than the rest of my face)"
To have kids
I literally have a day of the week (Sunday) entirely devoted to removing facial hair. 
"Hair on the genitals. I don‚Äôt care, nor mind it. "
Oh whoops. I've never done that but I've also never had a problem....?
"IUD is painful putting in and checking to see if it‚Äôs in place, but my god it‚Äôs a relief not having crippling periods anymore  

ETA: some iuds are different from others and some people don‚Äôt experience pain. I was just talking about my own experience. "

"Peanut noodles. I make a peanut sauce out of whatever I have on hand (usually natural peanut butter, soy sauce, ginger, chili garlic sauce, a little maple syrup, all thinned out with water), noodles (rice or soba noodles is best but I also like linguine), and whatever vegetables you have on hand. I usually add carrots, green onions, bell pepper, red cabbage, and tofu that‚Äôs been cubed into small pieces and baked so it‚Äôs all chewy. It is SO GOOD. Add enough veggies and it‚Äôs basically a salad, and it‚Äôs delicious cold for lunch. If you don‚Äôt like peanuts or are allergic you can sub tahini or almond butter."
"Where I live, flip flops are definitely considered valid footwear. I'm not even sure where they're not!"
"When I left my ex (after stupidly putting up with his abuse for 6 years) he told me if I left he would kill himself. I told him not to do it on the carpet because I wanted the deposit back.

I‚Äôve had many people who want me to meet them directly at their house instead of in public first and they‚Äôll be like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to kill you you know?‚Äù No.. I don‚Äôt know that...
"Can relate, but it terrifies me every time.  If you are a squeamish boy (or girl) stop reading now...  About 24 hours after I had my first baby, I birthed a softball size jellyfish in the bathroom of my hospital room.  I'll never forget that.  It was terrifying.  I was all alone and it was just sitting there in my underwear all unsteady and gross.  I was afraid it was going to fall on the floor, but not knowing what it was, I was afraid to put it in the toilet.  Just a clot, but it looked like an extra alien baby that was left behind.  "
My ex tried doing some shit like this one time to a girl with a fake ass because he ‚Äúloved her body‚Äù &amp; I was boiling in my fucking chair. Not because I was jealous but because WE (almost) HAD THE SAME BODY. 
"""Fortunately he just called me a bitch and walked away when I said no.""

I just wish men would think about this sentence. Because it perfectly summarizes the fear we have to deal with on a daily basis.

"All the Yes for ""slowly growing realization that other relationships weren't like this"". Everyone told me it would be less fun after a few years. 

So I put up with his games. His silence when I never figured out why he was angry. His demands of doing things in bed that hurt me, to prove that I loved him. His anger about my (completely normal) outfits, about me hugging friends,....


It took me years to stop feeling like I'm not allowed to enjoy anything without my SO's approval. "

"We spend a whole lot of time thinking about things other than guys, and a horrifying number of men are surprised by that. "
"Thats horrible! it makes you wonder if they even care about being reported. 

I took a cab home one night alone and the driver kept asking to have some of my coke (i had gotten mcdonalds before getting in the cab) and I had to keep telling him no, but he kept saying he'd been driving for ages and hadn't had a break. At one point he picked it up and asked if I was going to finish it and I kinda rudely told him he could stop at one of the shops we were passing if he wanted and keep the meter running, I didnt mind paying the extra. He declined, ended up drinking my coke because I got sick of saying no. Asked where I was from, told me I looked ""exotic."" Then when he dropped me off asked if my boyfriend was home and if i was going to tell him that he had asked if i was single. He gave me a weird interrogation to see what I would tell my boyfriend about the coke incident lol 

Also for context: the entire drive was like 15 minutes tops, this happened in 15 fucking minutes."
"""Being with you sure makes me miss Hell, babe"""
"I'm on the pill so it should be regular, but stress can bring about my period too so there is no guarantee for me. I was once stressing so much about a trip I was about to take, all the planning and getting everything in order and leaving the pets behind, that I spotted for a whole month."
"Just time honestly... time and better experiences. And being able to go outside my comfort zone a little bit at a time. And therapy.

I‚Äôm still working on it. It‚Äôs a process. But I‚Äôm happy for every bit of progress I make. I‚Äôm just excited to finally be able to sleep peacefully with my partner, which is not something I was able to do before. I even expressed this to him and we talked about it and it was a nice little moment that we shared there. I find so much joy in things most people would take for granted."
"Being nice to someone you're not interested in, even if they creep you out or are being rude."
"Maybe. We're 23, and I am his first real relationship. Before me, it was all casual hook ups, so he never had someone who was comfortable enough to guide and give constructive feedback. 

I was fine with it at first (2 years ago), thinking we'd grow together and learn each others bodies, but I am becoming more and more aware of his immaturity about sex.  I have been very clear that I want/need more foreplay, and gave examples of what I like, and I initiate using foreplay.  Unfortunately, he will listen to me and do it once after I mention it, then just go right back to trying to just take of my pants and stick it in. 

I am a very communicative and open person about how I feel and what I need, and I'm honestly pretty frustrated at this point because I feel like our sex could be consistently a lot better if he didn't think that he was only turning me on just so HE could have sex.

Sorry if you were looking something more uplifiting, this turned into a vent session I hadn't realized I needed. "
"When I was young I used to admire women who were naturally beautiful who didn't seem to take a lot of time on their appearance. Enter puberty and my ""low maintenance"" routine wasn't working because I looked horrible and I didn't understand why. In my early 20s I finally got that to get that look I had to take care of a lot of things, not just shower daily like my mom does. Now I take special care of my hands, my feet, my back, style my hair, use nude makeup, make sure my shoes are presentable and think a lot about what to wear, and bam! It worked."
"I heard someone recently say that women over 30 shouldn't wear short shorts or crop tops. I turned 30 this year and still wear everything I used to wear, including my crop tops and short shorts."

"-Gaslighting was a regular tactic of his.  
-He teased me about being a bad cook, having the tact of a rhino, and other things.  
-never wanted to have sex with me.  I quit counting after 10 months without it once. Made me feel bad for HAVING a sex drive and wanting him.  Said he didn‚Äôt know why sex was so important to me and things like that.  
-made me feel like I was lazy and worthless(without actually saying that) for not being able to keep up with the housework having a baby/toddler and demanding 4 pets to clean up after and take care of.  
-wouldn‚Äôt eat my cooking the last few years we were together.  
-told me I was always being negative and complaining.  
-told me I was a nazi with our money and he couldn‚Äôt be happy with me in charge of it, but he guilted me out of anything I ever wanted to spend money on(I‚Äôm very frugal)
-nixed a lot of my creative ideas over the years, but would ‚Äúcome up‚Äù with them himself as a great idea weeks/months/years later and deny that I had ever suggested it. 

Turns out when I rediscovered myself after he left that I‚Äôm a natural extrovert and optimist, great with money, very tidy, responsible, a pretty good cook, pretty, and my libido is nothing to feel bad about.  My aunt is one of my best friends and my confidante and just talking to her would help me get epiphanies and realize the shit he did, even 4 years later.  I can‚Äôt believe all the things he did to control me because it just didn‚Äôt seem like controlling behavior, but the effects on my psyche were very big.  "

Not to mention the cost of all those products (I‚Äôm not even going to go into the ‚Äòpink tax‚Äô).

When we broke up, I didn't want to see him again, so I gave him multiple options to return it to me: drop it off with my parents, give it to this friend, mail it to me, etc etc. He refused to do anything that wouldn't require a face to face meeting. He wanted to come to my place. He did not want to go anywhere public. This went on for a few days, with him perpetually attempting to hold the blanket over my head and force me to see him.

I finally gave it up as gone and blocked him. 

Two years later, I got a message from his roommate. My ex had finally given up on getting me to see him, and he'd made a big production in front of the roommate of throwing my blanket into the garbage. 

His roommate then retrieved it from the trash, washed it, and messaged me on facebook. Unlike my shitty ex, he was perfectly happy to meet me in a public place so I could bring a friend in case the ex turned up after all. Got my blanket back, bought lunch for the roommate as thanks, all ended well but *holy crap* I still can't believe he held onto that for two years trying to get me to see him.

A year later he found me on a dating site and tried to get me again by claiming he still had it - after I already had it back. Yeah."

"For the record, I know two women in their mid 60s with very long white hair. Like mid back to waist length. They are definitely lucky in being physically able to keep their hair so long- naturally thick, strong hair for sure. They both are constantly given compliments, but specifically ones mentioning how boho/witchy their hair is. I think long hair on women is often automatically associated with a certain level of crunchiness that many 40s and older women are looking to avoid. The two women I know are often referenced as fairy godmothers and goddesses, but in the ‚Äúcrone‚Äù aspect kind of way. I think they are both very beautiful and I plan to keep my hair long if I can as I age."

"The last straw was when he slapped me across the face at a new years party. It took me another month to leave.

In retrospect, I saw all the things my friends had expressed concern about adding together - the way he rewarded me with affection for dressing certain ways, but cut me down and withheld if he didn't like my clothes; the way he never supported me when I got insecure or upset, only tried to punish me in me in some way; the way he made fun of my friends and hobbies that he didn't think I should have, or shamed me for going places without him. 

Before our two year relationship, I regularly went to concerts and went out dancing with friends, enjoyed road trips and finding new music and going to conventions, liked tailored clothes and unique fashions. When I got out, I realized I had only been to one concert our whole relationship, because it was one he wanted to go to (and he thought my musical taste was ""stupid""). We'd gone dancing once, and it almost hadn't happened because beforehand he told me he'd rather dance with ""girls who know how"". I hadn't traveled at all aside from short trips to see his family with him. I hadn't been to any new events. I'd stopped wearing my favorite clothes, and I only wore shapeless, baggy clothes, because that was what he said he preferred.

A couple years ago, I re-read my old diary, which goes back to before I ever dated him and has entries throughout our relationship. In one entry, just a few months after we started dating, I wrote that he'd punched me in the eye. I'd completely forgotten this incident. At the time, he'd said it was an accident, and he'd seemed genuinely contrite, and I'd believed him. I let it slide. In retrospect, I was sending him a message: you can get away with this. And he did."
"Styling my hair without heat. I wash at night, leave in conditioner is a must, and it goes in braids before bed to get a curl in it or just a generic bun for a light wave. The braids also keeps it from knotting during the night.

I use Garnier Fructis leave in condition right after my shower and pick it through with a wide tooth comb....
I let it dry part way (someone said 70% dry) so its not wet in the morning, it also tames down frizz and fly a ways....
I do dutch braids (similar to a french braid but under lap the middle section instead) or pigtails depending if i want the curls at the top of my head or not...

There's a lot of gaslighting that goes on around this, if we have a genuine reason to be upset by something it's dismissed as being hysterical/overly-sensitive or we aren't seeing things logically \[like a man\]. It also comes into play with the idea of 'crazy ex's' and 'nagging girlfriends', it's always framed as women being emotional or irrational rather than acknowledging the reasons for there being some upset.

"I've tried to have meetups with four guys from online dating sites who all stood me up because of my height. 

The first guy apparently saw me from far away, messaged me ""I didn't know you were that tall... Sorry, I'm not comfortable with that"" and left without even meeting me. 

After that, I told guys before meeting up that I'm tall (I'm not even that tall... I'm 5'10, but I live in Korea, so some of the guys tended to be shorter than that) playing it off as a joke but just letting them know so that I wouldn't get stood up again. 

Guys 2, 3, and 4 all stood me up in the same way and for the same reason as Guy 1. Guy 5 went on a couple dates with me, and WOULDN'T STOP TALKING ABOUT MY HEIGHT to the point it made ME uncomfortable... He was 5'8, I didn't give a fuck, but he did. 

Similar problems with guys I've met in person, both in the US and Korea. ""I'd date you, but I'm into girls who are shorter than me. Having a girl taller than you is just... weird."" I literally don't care at all. I've gotten this from guys were 5'4 all the way up to dudes who are THE SAME HEIGHT AS ME but are still irked by that, even.

So yeah. Short guys: I tried to date you, didn't work. Every guy I've ended up with has been taller because of short guys' insecurities. "

"&gt; We had a talk about how she doesnt really notice slight touches on her breasts and such while i as a guy with a muscled chest notice every single touch against it. I guess thats the difference between fat and muscle and it kinda makes sense that a muscle would feel more.

Actually that's pretty much exactly it. OK so buckle up buttercup we're about to get _scienfuckintific_ in here.

Basically, your body's ability to tell where it is in space is part of a sense called proprioception, which can be roughly summed up as ""where are my bits, how many of them do I have, and how are they feeling in relation to all my other bits"". This sense is detected by different organs throughout the body, but the really critical ones for THIS topic are the muscle spindles and the Golgi tendon organs, particularly the spindles. Spindles wrap around the fibres of certain parts of your skeletal muscles (the muscles you can consciously move) and basically fire electrical signals into your nerves at a rate that's determined by how squished-up the coils are. The more squished, the slower they fire. Since muscles rely on becoming longer and shorter in order to move, this is a pretty effective way that the body can use to tell how stretched each muscle is, and from this it can tell where each limb is positioned, how the back is arched, what direction the feet are in and what angle, etc etc. There's over 600 muscles so this is a REALLY accurate picture, and it's updated hundreds of times a second to give an accurate, subconscious map of where all your bits are, relative to all your other bits.

What this effectively means, though, is that you can only tell where your _muscles_ are, using this system. There are other proprioceptive organs, but none of them exist to any substantial degree in fat tissue (though some do exist in skin, which gets a bit... complicated, skin is not actually as homogenous as it seems). 

This gives you the weird situation that women know where the _muscle_ in our chest is? But not the fatty lumps on TOP, so you end up in this situation where we kinda _forget_ that they exist because our subconscious map doesn't really register them, except as eccentricities on our centre of mass. Meanwhile those with less of the tittymeat will end up with a more precise picture, because there's less difference. "

"Not Reddit overall, but this sub as well as r/askwomenadvice have made me realize a few things.

1. We, as a society, do an absolutely horrendous job teaching young men about consent, human interaction, and emotional intelligence.

2. Insecurities in men are rampant, though society tends to portray women as the more insecure sex

3. Most, or at least many, of the issues between men and women are due to society telling us how to behave rather than actual differences between the sexes/genders.

The last point perhaps should have been obvious to me, but being an active participant in both subs has really driven the point home.

I see sweet, romantic, shy men and confident, assertive, powerful women both mocked and treated poorly for no other reason than their personalities belong to the other gender, according to society. "

"That reminds me of the study on the front page of Reddit the other day about how women made fun of another woman‚Äôs sexy outfit.  The natural conclusion all the men on Reddit drew was that women do it because they are competing in some sort of animalistic sexual hierarchy for men‚Äôs attention.  And not because, you know, the women were gossiping for the camaraderie of it, or because the outfit was unprofessional and would cause all the female students as a whole to be taken less seriously, or because the outfit shown was straight out of the 90‚Äôs.

"I was with my ex for almost 3 years. Over that time, there was a lot of fighting and verbal abuse. He didn‚Äôt really try that hard with my family, with doing things for me, or being with me at all.

Almost a year later, I‚Äôm much happier in life and in my relationship than I thought possible.

"Our libidos are mismatched, and I have had sex with people who I've had insane sexual chemistry with. But my SO is great at sex, when we do have it. He knows my body like the back of his right hand. But I do all the initiating, he's... big, and that hurts in some angles, which takes some of the fun out of it, and there's an element of spontenaity missing and since I do 99% of the initiating - I don't feel very desired.   


But, he's also the person I have had sex with the most, and that's bound to reflect on his track record. I'm not dissatisfied with the actual sex, I'm dissatisfied with everything surrounding and leading up to it. 

Edit: missed a word."

"When he asked me to stay somewhere else while his friend visited from out of town. I slept in my car because i was homeless without crashing with him. Turns out his friend was a chick from online that had a crush on him for years and he took her v card. Only reason i found out is because i invited him to a mutual friends house to get drunk. He showed up with her hanging all over him.

We had talked about open relationships and how much i was not ok with them."
"it places you in an imbalanced spot - you're the one who takes care of people. if you ever try to lean on friends who see you this way, the discomfort is EXACTLY like that expressed by a kid whose parent is violating the rules by coming to them for support.

"It was emotionally and psychologically abusive and everyone else saw it but me. I was so completely miserable but didn't know until the very end. When he kept making senseless, bizarre excuses for things and made me feel as though I were going insane I knew something wasn't right. 

It's also not normal to feel totally insecure in your relationship because someone holds normal communication in front of you like a dangling carrot but never changes and keeps making empty promises. It's also not normal to cry on almost a daily basis because you feel you have to make major exceptions for poor behavior. Relationships shouldn't feel like torture. I didn't know this until I met my husband and there was no doubt that he truly loved me and never lets a moment go by without reminding me somehow. "
"Haha i read so many YA books (fantasy fan) and always thought women would notice their breasts like i as a guy notice my breast muscles.

Then my gf asked me once why i smirked after she leaned over to give me kiss. I said ""your boob got smushes on top of my arm and that was nice"" she was surprised because she really didnt notice that she put her tit on my arm, even though i thought she did it on purpose.

We had a talk about how she doesnt really notice slight touches on her breasts and such while i as a guy with a muscled chest notice every single touch against it. I guess thats the difference between fat and muscle and it kinda makes sense that a muscle would feel more.

This also explained why some women with larger breasts seem to ""always put their breast on the table"" when they lean forward. Now i know they just dont notice and dont do it on purpose.

I guess certain things are hard to understand if its not your body, but as a writer these guys should atleast talk to women about stuff or let them ""fact check"" what they wrote if its prom the POV of a woman while he is a guy, to avoid these inconcistencies."
I still have makeup anxiety. I'm an artist in every other medium but I freak out when it comes to how much I don't understand makeup and have zero frame of reference for what's good and what isn't. I follow MUA and MUAcirclejerk because I love them both. But I just can't do it myself. Fortunately I'm super comfortable being without any makeup 99% of the time.

"We went to Disney World together with his family. On the way there the car got a flat tire. The spare was built into the bottom of the car and something got jammed so it wouldn't release. We couldn't figure it out so i grabbed the owner manual to try to find the answer. He saw me and just exploded with ""if i can't figure it out what makes you think you can!? You think you are just smarter than everybody but you're not so stop acting like you're better than us!!"" 
I was completely shocked and just said i was trying to help. I ended up finding the answer on a YouTube demonstration but he grabbed my phone from me and hid it away. An hour later his step dad gets the car in a shop and we stop for lunch and he starts yelling at me for not talking. 

He wanted to marry me and i am so thankful i ended that relationship. He had serious anger issues and was always verbally abusive to me. "
I‚Äôm not crying ur crying 
I never realized how big an issue this was until a tinder date was absolutely shocked when I understood her wanting to switch to a bar she knew better instead of getting pissy with her. I always figured it was only the shittiest members of society who freaked out about things like that.
"I totally agree, I love being there for them but it's hard when you rarely get anything more back (and when they don't think they can do anything for you!), even small things to recognise all you do for them would be nice but obviously you're gonna keep looking after them either way!"

"I made the mistake of letting him in when he showed up crying at my door. He said he had to use the bathroom and he instead went for a bath and cried loudly in the tub. It was sooooo awkward. 

He also threatened to kill himself if I didn't take him back a few days later. I was so done with dealing with him so I got in touch with a family member and a friend of his, said he's threatening suicide and blocked him on everything. "

My husband laughed too hard at my joke and it made me cry. 
"Oh shit! You reminded me that I loved that series in middle school, but my interest faded off during book 2/3. Your comment made me realize I lost interest because the story started to center around Tally and Shay (are those the right characters??) competing for a guy.

Damn. Book One and the whole concept of that world was so good, though. :/ It was way more interesting when the young ""ugly"" was just fighting the power to stay true to herself."

"I knew he'd made me feel miserable all the time but I still thought that was just a normal ""rocky"" relationship until six months later when my new partner thought it was funny how I was meticulously towel drying my entire body after a shower before setting foot on the bath mat. I had been so trained by my ex's controlling rages and he hid the abuse for so long because all of the outcomes he wanted (for me to go to bed at a certain time, for there to be not even one drop of water on the bathroom floor, for me to always be losing weight) were always framed as him wanting what's best for me. 

I didn't leave because of the abuse, I left because I finally started seeing a therapist who helped me heal just enough to start pushing back against the control and assert myself. This in turn led to months of fighting and an eventual breakup followed by over two years of him coming in and out of my life trying to manipulate and control me. For anyone reading this who recognizes themselves in my story, it will only get better if you leave!"
I never learned to wipe correctly as a child or using a loofa or anything in the shower to clean. Had to learn as I got older. 
"The rule is basically ""don't wear anything with black that could at a glance be mistaken for a different shade of black.""  Blacks are supposed to match (and yes, there are absolutely different shades of black).  Brown also isn't supposed to go with black, but that ""rule"" has faded more and more.  In reality, wearing navy or brown with black really depends on how it's worn.  Sometimes it looks good.  Sometimes, it looks like you got dressed in the dark."
"As someone else said, conditioner.

Also, I had very long hair past my waist until I was 18 as I wasn't allowed to cut it. It also went from pin straight to curly when I hit puberty, and I had *no* idea how to deal with it. My hair was an awful frizzy long heavy puffball for most of my teenage years.

I didn't know hair straighteners existed until I was 16 ish. I literally cried of happiness the first time I straightened a section, and from there I straightened my hair daily. When I was 17 or so, I made friends with a really sweet girl who explained scrunching a little gel into wet hair to tame curls. I tried it and suddenly I had a head full of long, gorgeous curls!

When I hit adulthood, I cut my hair progressively shorter for a few years just because I could, and sadly my terminal length seems to exist around my collarbone now. I wish I'd known how to care for my long/curly hair sooner so I could have enjoyed it more."

"When they in absolute seriousness give the measurements of a supposedly beautiful and sexy female character something like this: hips 34 inch (86 cm), waist 30 inch (76 cm), which would be a very slender girl with narrowish hips but not too slim waist. And then kaboom! for whatever reason they feel like adding a bra size too: 38D!!! Do they have any idea that it would make their character look like the genius from the lamp in Disney Aladin? 38 inch (96 cm) is the rib cage size, add D cup to it, it would make total chest measurement about 110 cm (43 inch). 86-76-110. What happened to the good old 90-60-90? Or if they want to be modern realistic, consider bottom bigger than the top."
"This is me as well. Lack of sex doesn't bother me really, but lack of physical affection outside of that absolutely would.

Vegetable tacos are easy. Cook some beans, onions and potatoes add it into a tortilla and pan fry it. 

Or have some roasted vegetables that have been tossed in oil and your favorite herbs. The leftovers are also versatile for making other dishes. "

"Maybe it‚Äôs just where I live, but I feel like I‚Äôm expected to ‚Äútake care of‚Äù my husband to the point of babying him. Some of his friends‚Äô wives are shocked that I don‚Äôt make his lunches every day, do his laundry (and lay out outfits for him for special events), book all of his appointments, and do things like automatically refresh his drink and make plates for him at group gatherings. To be clear, for all of these couples both spouses work full time. I once asked my spouse if he wanted me to do these things, and he was horrified by the idea and weirded out that his friends all seem to like being treated this way. 

The time this was the clearest was at a barbecue where a wife handed her husband his plate of food, then when he didn‚Äôt acknowledge it or her because he was telling a story, she took it back to cut all of his meat for him. NOBODY seemed to think this was weird but me and my spouse. "

"My grandmother has 3 sons and 2 other male grandchildren. When she began showing signs of dementia, needing care in her home, my dad asked I stay with her. That was over a year ago. I realized I was under qualified and to emotionally involved. She refused her sons knowing the extent of her frailty. I sought therapy, and the reality was I have no authority as a granddaughter to get her professional help. I wasn't allowed to talk to her doctors, make appointments, take care of bills, order services, or hire a nurse if I needed to leave. My dad felt all his problems were solved that I drop my life to be a free caregiver to his mother. I got praised as a saint by nurses, those who know how demanding my grandmother is. It wasn't ever my choice, it was just expected of me as the only female in her immediate family."

"I‚Äôm allergic to kiwi, but I didn‚Äôt realize it until I was an adult. I grew up eating it, and just thought that everyone‚Äôs mouth felt numb and tingly from it like mine did. I thought my allergic reaction was normal, so I just kept eating kiwi.

The same logic can be applied to a lot of my past relationships. I put up with toxic or abusive relationships because I thought it was normal. It‚Äôs not normal for someone to try and control you. It‚Äôs not normal to ever feel unsafe. The few good moments don‚Äôt justify the pain they cause. And it‚Äôs not normal for your mouth to go numb while eating kiwi."
"I never thought about the muscle vs fat thing... This makes more sense to me.

I remember a thread where someone was complaining that their coworker sometimes touches his shoulder with her tit when she tries to lean over to point at something on his computer screen. I was trying to convince him that she likely wasn't hitting on him, just sometimes boobs touch stuff and we don't really notice - and that as a woman I've had other straight women tit me in a similar situation."
Doesn't bother me unless it's like obviously being used in a condescending way. 
"Last ex

"Your hair often thins significantly as you age (yes, this happens to women and men as well) and becomes brittle. For women it‚Äôs partially due to the hormonal changes that come with menopause. They can affect your hair. A shorter hair style looks better if that‚Äôs happening to you because it won‚Äôt look as thin and brittle if you don‚Äôt have scraggly thin ends."
"When he called our adopted boys, now teenagers, maternal grandparents and told them he was done being a dad that they could have them back and would sign over custody to them. This, after we'd fought for 4 years in court to have sole custody of them.  This was a Monday,  by Friday I'd found an apartment for me and my boys and we left.   After 28 yrs of marriage there is no going back.    The teen years are hard but this is the point of no return for me"
"That slightly greasy/shiny lived-in foundation look. A couple of hours later, I think the makeup seems pretty good. "
"She hissed at him and ran off. She never really liked him, it‚Äôs hilarious because she loves my fianc√© now lol "
Cold breeze down the dormitory hall? Guess what these nips are doing /s
Anyone else find this thread refreshingly empowering? I LOVE women not giving a fuck. Women give so many fucks. Y‚Äôall are my heroes.
"I walk around on busy streets a lot these days, and I've started just not moving. I stay in my ""lane"" (right side of the sidewalk), look ahead to where I'm walking, and don't get out of the way if guys are walking towards me. Many guys will get out of my way either bc they're polite and realize they're on the wrong side of the sidewalk or they can sense I'm not gonna move. Plenty don't, so I just bump into them and keep going. It's kind of like a game lol"
I found myself feeling contempt for him. 
"When I inadvertently saw the Skype messages between him and a close mutual friend where he told her how amazing the weirdly specific way he'd asked her to give him a blowjob was. He asked me to do it like that not knowing I'd seen the messages. He told me the messages were obviously an inside joke between the two as if I'd believe that in a million years. I eventually found out he'd cheated on me for at least 2 of the nearly-four years we we're  together. To end of our relationship (and after, to an extent) he gaslit me, verbally abused me, and held me hostage in my own house because he 'was having a fugue state' despite never mentioning having bipolar (which is something I actually have and struggle with). To this day I'm sure he would deny the fact that he cheated on me. Sucks to know somebody for six years and realize you don't actually know anything about who they fundamentally are as a human being!"
"Don't get me wrong, I understand where straight women are coming from when they say ""Maybe I should convert, I'm so sick of dudes."" However, their relationships with men would vastly improve if they worked on their communication skills &amp; boundaries. So yes, my wife is awesome and my experience with being gay is cool, but that isn't a cure-all. "
oh god the worst is when you‚Äôre sick on your period... trying to clench while you cough ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è lest you push your tampon right out!

"John Green books always make me think that. Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns in particular, but almost all of the other ones too. "
"That we hate other women. - just check out the front page for that ""new study"". That sounds like the unis culture and the culture of the city more than a universal truth women hate women. "
"Caring for my feet. Like... most children don't need a pedicure, right. But at some point, your feet start accumulating dead skin. Which with women wearing open shoes... not a sight to behold. It wasnt until I was like 20, did I learn you can just have a scrubber thingy in your bathroom and it takes 30 seconds per foot to keep them in check. It feels so much cleaner too.

(I dont have excsessive skin or anything. Just a normal amount. But gaddamn, does it annoy me to see it on some other women now)"
one day a week? My facial hair grows in at it's own pace. At the minimum I'm in front of the mirror every 3 days pulling the long/dark ones.

"Stephen King revealed a lot of weird sexual hang-ups during his coke-fueled writing in the 80s. IT, Carrie, and The Shining all have moments in then with weird sex scenes or commentary on character's sexuality in ways that did nothing to round out the characters or move the story forward. Some of it seemed like it he did it just for shock value, or because he thought it would sell, which it did."
"Agreed. I'm 29 and my bf is 27, which isn't a big gap at all, but people always comment on his being younger than me. Two years wouldn't even bat an eyelid if our ages were around the other way!"
I am not your experiment.

"Every single girl in the Wheel of Time series. 

Nynaeve actually pulls her own braid when she's mad. Like wut? And they all cross their arms over their breasts. Not across their chests. I swear, he's damned near saying they bounce boobily through the room. "
"My parents made an executive decision &amp; took care of one I had once. It ended up being for the good though.

I had a particularly nasty one on my cheek that just was NOT getting any better or going away. One night they had me lay down, they thoroughly sterilized a needle, then carefully scraped away the top layer of the zit. Turns out, the pus or whatever it was inside had just turned into this hard ball. They carefully pulled it out, used hydrogen peroxide on the spot, then put a small bandaid on it. In a few days, it looked SO much better &amp; was finally shrinking and healing."
"Oh man. Can I talk about an ex? 

This guy was the epitome of ‚Äúhas only watched porn‚Äù, and his version of ‚Äúgoing down on me‚Äù was trying to finger me like a jackhammer. He never once actually *went down on me*, and the times that he did (again, only by fingering me), I could count on one hand if that hand had two fingers. 

I definitely don‚Äôt mean to shame guys in general because I know they have lots of issues with being loud during sex, etc., but when he had an orgasm, I literally could not tell. His face would stay the same (if not slightly more contorted) and he would just be *silent*. It was the strangest, most disconcerting thing. 

Our breakup sex lasted about 3 seconds, so that only solidified my decision to break up. We were incompatible in many ways, but our sexual incompatibility was *definitely* one of the main reasons why I couldn‚Äôt stay any longer. "
"My mom has early on-set dementia and somehow, she remembered my name. It has been years since I‚Äôve heard her say it. "
Me too! I fell in love with one bald man. Now the world is my oyster and and all I see is pearls.

"I think the Asian trophy girlfriend stereotype exists too, though, especially in relation to wealthy IT men. "
"My best friend for the last 25 years is also 25 years older than me. She is roughly the same age as my mother. My friend and I don't have a mother-daughter relationship despite the age gap. We've traveled the world together, cried over men together, etc. Age has only recently become an issue as she is 68 now and having physical difficulties. It is a bit hard to face that reality."
"When you both keep trying to fix it no matter how big or small. Once one of you stops fighting for your relationship, then it's no longer a rough patch. "
"Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden - I realised that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! 

And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, he always looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.

EDIT: very glad to see people understood my reference. "
"I get so annoyed because I find bald guys attractive, but none of my friends do. I get so many comments about guys I find attractive like ""he would look better with hair though."""
"Bad drivers. Every time I have to parallel park I get nervous thinking someone's watching and thinking ""oh lets watch this woman try to park"". I'm an excellent parallel parker fyi."

"If I got my views about men solely from Reddit, I don‚Äôt think I would ever want to be around a man or speak to one again. Men on this website can be genuinely horrendous but I don‚Äôt think that reflects all men. I do wonder how many men I encounter in real life think the disgusting things about women that I see men on here post though. "
Orphan Black has a great variety of female characters. Because there is no one woman that is representative of all women.
I hate this one to my core. Especially so when this stereotype is portrayed as some sort of ideal wife or mail order bride. It‚Äôs okay for women to have opinions. And be loud. And make decisions. And not live and die by the comfort or discomfort of men. Ugh!
It's confusing as hell when you refer to your best friends as girlfriends! We never know if you mean platonic or romantic. 
Women are too emotional and can't be trusted to make decisions.
We hosted Christmas for the first time in our house and my family got to meet my fianc√®'s family and it was so amazing. Just so much laughter and happiness. People are still calling us to tell us how lovely it was. 
"Moisturizing my face. I've had acne since middle school and always used drying skin products to reduce the oil. Took me until a year or two ago to start using a decent non comedogenic moisturizer after cleansing and it's helped a lot! Also now that I'm older, a lot of acne products are too harsh for my skin so I've found that I can get away with using glycolic cleansers instead of salicylic acid. Thank goodness for finding an esthetician who knows what she's doing!"

It seems like he liked the idea lf having a girlfriend than actually having a girlfriend. Hope you find someone worth your love though.

I didn't realize that stress can make you spot... Things make a lot of sense now lol. 
... But women have waaaay shorter urethra's which is why women have an easier time passing kidney stones. It's like an inch versus a whole dick
"Same. I love wearing makeup for occasions, but day to day I go without. Mostly because I *really* hate taking off makeup before bed."
Legendary.
Apparently our urethras are like duck vaginas. 
"Can I please just say, as a girl who grew up without a mom, this post is insanely helpful. Especially since I now that I have a little girl of my own. Thanks so much everyone! "
"I'm kinda embarrassed to say, but at 26 years old I finally understand how to properly remove my makeup.

Even when I started putting on makeup I knew how important it was to remove, but dear Lord I half-assed it.

I would just use a makeup wipe and be done with it... I wouldn't even properly wash my face afterward most of the time, maybe a splash of water if I wasn't lazy. It wasn't until I started getting reoccurring cysts on my eyelids that I realized that something was wrong. I thought my makeup that was the problem, so I replaced everything. But when the cysts would keep coming back, I was perplexed.

But one time when I was removing my makeup, and actually took a deep look afterward, I realized there was still so much makeup left on my skin.

So I quickly realized that I can't just use a makeup wipe and be done with it. It's so important to make sure you thoroughly get everything off. REALLY go in with that makeup wipe (oil based typically works best), wash your face WELL with a wash cloth afterward, and exfoliate if you have to. I haven't had any problems since.

"I asked my ex-husband for a divorce several months ago. He spent the next few months trying to persuade me through increasingly desperate texts and phone calls to change my mind. Even though I'd been married to him for years and knew he was a good guy, his behavior was worrying me, making me anxious and creeped out, as he was ignoring any and all boundaries I tried to put up. I couldn't rule out that he wouldn't just ""show up"" at my house or work, and there are no words to describe how terrifying it is to realize you no longer feel safe anywhere. Our divorce hasn't been finalized yet, and although he has backed off after telling him he was creeping me out and making me feel unsafe, that I was thinking about getting a restraining order, I still feel dread when I see a truck like his on the road, wondering if it's him and whether he has ""snapped"".

We've all heard stories of women stalked, raped, and/or killed by their significant others after breaking up or a divorce. It seems like every other crime story details this scenario, and the statistics back it up."
I think it‚Äôs just hitting me now.
"I can't stick anything in my belly button without feeling like I'm going to puke. My ex made fun of me all the time and said it was gross (not that it smelled, but he knew I didn't clean it). Just thinking about touching it gives me anxiety. I have no idea how to clean it without feeling sick. "
When I saw nudes on his phone he was trading with a girl while we were on vacation together. Turns out he'd slept with her several times just before the vacation as well.
My mom started crying when she was pregnant with me because she was afraid the neighbors cow was gonna eat her because she was wearing a green dress
I was too busy being in love with Karen Gillan and the Rock to notice a single flaw in that movie. 
Yes! He is 6 years old now and spoiled rotten! 
"Seriously, people who treat animals like that should be avoided. Glad you moved on from that. "
When he dumped me over the phone. 3 days before we had been talking about engagement rings and how I didnt want a diamond. Then bam. Dumped out of nowhere.
"Panicking to find a ride home after a late closing shift after work (12am-1am). The college city I live in is pretty dangerous at night, so I‚Äôll have to ask a coworker with a big enough car to fit my bike in for a ride since the buses stop running at 11:45 pm. I can‚Äôt bring myself to pay the outrageous prices for Uber or Lyft in my city for a ten minute ride, and the bike route home is full of bushes that someone can easily hide in out of view at night. "
"I‚Äôve always known that looks matter. They do, and everyone should recognize that this is true *to an extent*. It doesn‚Äôt make you a bad person to not be sexually attracted to someone and therefore not want to date them. It‚Äôs not okay to then bully/belittle someone based on their looks. "
I was so happy to be having a baby with this incredible man that it made me cry every time he was around....he had to sleep on the couch for a month which also made me cry because I felt bad. 
Indeed. Terry Pratchett always had brilliant women.

That they eat dogs/cats. Coming from an Asian woman herself it gets quite annoying constantly hearing these jokes. I‚Äôm from the US and it literally irks me 
"I‚Äôm a brown Latina. My vaginal area is darker than the rest of my skin. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs something I deal with. It‚Äôs just part of me. Men don‚Äôt seem to mind. If they did, get the fuck out with that nonsense. And I certainly don‚Äôt mind. It‚Äôs just how I look. 

We have larger, fatter vaginas in my family. It‚Äôs a family thing. Women in our fam are very open about nudity. The women in my family say we all resemble the hood of a 68 VW Beetle. That makes me laugh. I‚Äôm not the hugest fan of my extended family, but they gave me any confidence I have. Especially about stuff like that. 

Anyway, I love my genitals just the way they are. "
"Lava showers, male partners always complained i shower too hot which apparently is a female thing. "
Having inserted Foley Catheters for a living that's a downright lie. 
"I've heard a trick is to buy a cheap white shirt preferably one size up, put it on and have someone tightly wrap duct tape wherever the shirt is, then cut it off on one side. Then you sew it up and stuff with fibre or newspapers and hot glue some cardboard under to keep the stuffing in. Then you can tailor your shirt to your specifications. There's tons of tricks but that's one I would like to do once I have the expendable funds to commit to learning this skill."
"My MIL's second sentence upon arrival was literally ""And you're still very skinny I see"" which she later followed up by inferring that I might have an eating disorder. 

I don't take it personally, that woman has been on some diet or another her whole life. She's... Invested in weight to a weird degree. "
"A lot of guys think vaginas and nipples of women work like a dick:

Think of tits =&gt; boner

Feel aroused =&gt; boner

Feel bored =&gt; boner

Sleep =&gt; boner

So they obviously guess (if they never talked or been with a woman before) that this counts for vaginas and nipples too, so if any of that happens the vagina gets wet and the nipple gets hard.

The funny thing is, guys have nipples too, so they should know when they will get hard and when not, since as a guy i dont even notice my nipples 90% of the time, so why would a woman that just has a larger breast than me?

Sometimes its as easy as that but since breasts get so sexualized some guys seem to be a bit delusional."
"Is that a no-no? I thought black goes with everything...? 

Legit asking here"
rude but kinda hilarious
"Ugh, PCOS made me grow enough hair on the chin and cheeks that it constituted a thin beard. Until I caved in and lasered it, I used to shave every day or I‚Äôd feel people‚Äôs eyes on it all the time.  
  
I think if I still had it now maybe I‚Äôd be able to skip shaves without feeling so disgusted by my face, but I was a self-comscious teenage girl back then. "
"In the books, Hermione Granger, Ginny Weasley, and Luna Lovegood are all different types of girls, but are good representations of girls because of their different personalities, dreams, ambitions, etc."
One time I was on my period day 3 or something and I was feeling bad so I took a bath. Part way through my bath I sneezed and out shot blood and next thing I knew I was bathing in my menstrual blood. When I‚Äôm on my period I always crave taking a bath but never do because I‚Äôm afraid that will happen again. Period = no baths.
