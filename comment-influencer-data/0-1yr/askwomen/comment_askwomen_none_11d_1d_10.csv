Touching a woman‚Äôs pregnant belly without consent.
"&gt; I don't understand society's obsession with making little kids wear/play with gender specific things

It's because we put *such* a big emphasis on gender as adults. It dictates a huge portion of your future roles and responsibilities. We like to pretend it doesn't or that gender doesn't matter, but...like...look around, people. Gender is *huge*. And since childhood is supposed to be about socializing children into their adult roles, we find it super important that our children are socialized ""properly."" It's the same reason people freak out if you call their infant the wrong gender. I mean...that baby is 3 months old, Karen. It's not a big deal if your daughter hears 'he's so cute'. She's not gonna be scarred for life. But for whatever reason, we're really invested in making sure our kids are *only* treated as their correct gender. So we create all these easy-to-identify markers of gender (boys wear blue, girls have pierced ears, etc) so that our precious babies aren't treated ""wrong"" for even one second of their lives."
"Thankfully, a slight change with this has begun in the world but still:

Women sexually wanting underage boys! Maybe even sleeping with them!

Holy fuck it makes me furious because they can sometimes be so fucking obvious and blatant and people think: ""Oh he's a boy, he probably wants it!""

FUCK YOU.

In general, actually, just how women seem to be able to assault and rape men without consequences because: ""He wanted it anyway."" I realize the last part cuts both ways, but at the very least you've seen male rapists get their punishment, how many female rapists have gotten the same?!"
"This is rarely talked about but infantilizing feminine names. Think: Annie, Emily, Mary, Pattie, Jennie, Jamie, Chrissy, etc. The ""ie""/""y"" ending - you know like cutie baby!! 

This is instilling from a young age to well into adulthood that you are not to be taken seriously, because cutie!! You're soooo*oooo* sweet, sweetie!! It's linguistically proven we do not take people with these names seriously, and it is more critical in women than men, because how many birth certificate named boys do you know that are Timmy? It's Tim right? But how many birth certificate named girls are named Molly? It's Molly right? 

We ought to not infantilize women at all, and take them seriously, but we don't do them any favors when choosing their names like this."
"I will always be the believer that Reddit is as wholesome as you want it to be. Thank you, kind stranger."
"See also ""bachelor parties,"" with lap dances, strippers, blow jobs etc etc. that do nothing except plant the seeds of betrayal &amp; distrust before the marriage even gets started."
It is horrible! How can you mutilate your baby like that? D:
"If you were only asking for my number to fake a friendship that you later want to turn into dating, I'd prefer you didn't."
"Well that's certainly true, I especially hate the whole guys can't be emotional that's pushed on literally every guy even if your parents teach it's okay society as whole does it."
"It doesn‚Äôt work longterm.  The person feeling unloved, undervalued, misunderstood and taken for granted will eventually spiral into a deep depression after working so hard for approval and acceptance.  Or, they find someone else and balance is restored. 

Never stay with someone that isn‚Äôt fully into you."
"Unlimited PTO is used as a selling point at my office, and for millennials the idea of being able to take off whenever you want, for how long you want (within reasonable means) does sound like a ""perk,"" and honestly I think the millennials in my office are the only ones who probably get their money's worth on the PTO. As for the baby boomers in my office though, they're always grumbling when Millennial A is taking a four-day trip ""again"" and Millennial B is taking off to take her kid to the doctor for the third time this month, and how they haven't taken a day off in 20 years (exaggeration but still...) so ""what gives them the right"". Ugh, sigh.   
But once again, it is nice to know at the end of a particularly stressful chunk of time at work or once a huge project gets wrapped up I can treat myself to a few mental health days without worrying about my PTO allowance."
This made me so uncomfortable as a kid. Same with kissing someone I barely knew.
"My dad would always make jokes about no dating until 35, after marriage etc. but in the long run he really didn‚Äôt care."
"I don't mind it so much in casual conversation, but in a professional setting it's really grating. In my workplace, everyone uses ""ladies"" for the women and ""fellas/guys"" for the men."
I saw a groupon for 30 bottles of wine so I now have 30 bottles of wine. I don't even drink much.
"Exactly this isnt the Middle Ages... I have seen that in some places in the world girls are taken to doctors to check their hymens for their virginity in order to get married... 
Extra fucked up considering hymens can break through strenuous exercise or inserting tampons."
"I hate this and all the sexualization of children presented as outrage. Like, ""I can't believe they're letting her wear a two piece bathing suit at that age! It's inappropriate!"" Um, no. She's four and her chest is as flat as the shirtless little boy next to her. Stop being gross and making something innocent out as something scandalous."
Sorry that has happened to you - I feel you. Sucks.
" If you break up, do you like, just send them a letter and that's that? Or are there legal matters involved?"
"Letting small children (male or female) stare/peep at people changing. Either in a public changeroom or elsewhere. It's uncomfortable, and gross. Teach your children boundaries please. Nobody likes to pee/change with an audience. 

And to the parents who are like ""oh, they're just curious!"" NO. That's just teaching them that their actions have no consequences. I feel like it's raising kids who feel entitled to look/comment/touch other people's bodies. It's even worse when they ask/point out things on other people's bodies. Teach your damn kids to keep their hands/eyes to themselves."
Spending it with my boyfriend. Playing Monopoly and a couple RPG‚Äôs. Just relaxing.
"I used to do various jobs at a school I went to, to help pay tuition.

The ladies room was always a disaster... I won't go into the gory details, but I could never understand how they could make messes like that and just leave them.

The men's rooms were never entirely clean, but nowhere as bad as their counterparts.

My bathroom is cleaned once a week or more if needed, and if one of my family leaves a mess I call them to go back and fix it.

I'd often wanted to put up signs while I was working, but I could just imagine the graffiti or other vandalism. Or, God forbid, I offended anyone.

Ladies and gentlemen, yes, ""They have people to do that,""
Just give me your address so that *you* can be one of *those people*.

To anyone I may have offended, I do offer sincere apologies."
Not sure. Currently I just realised they stole my documents again. The documents I was able to get back any way.
My Mom‚Äôs oats cake. She only makes it for my dads birthday and mine cause we absolutely love it. It gets devoured within hours.
"Concert tickets for BTS.

My 12-year-old daughter is a super fan and she called me super excited that they were coming here on tour and we had to go, and she was texted me the link for tickets which had just gone on sale. Knowing how much she lives BTS, and what a stellar kid she has, I entered my credit card number and bought two decent seats, right then and there.

She neglected to mention they were coming to *Mew Jersey*, not *Boston*, where we live. With her Dad‚Äôs schedule and a toddler little brother, there was no way we could make it to New Jersey for an overnight. It was entirely on me for not being vigilant but I was able to pass the tickets on to her cousins, who were very grateful!"
"My mom has worked as a vet tech for 16 years and says exactly this. People think because their dog is small that it doesn't need to be properly trained, but those are the worst dogs they have to deal with at the clinic."
We shame people for being what we don't allow ourselves to be.
"I stayed home with my kids. It grows a much tighter relationship between parent and child.  I also see a lot of parents who both work just buying the kids anything they want, huge mistake."
"Oh yeah, I'm the same way. I have a handwritten list on the fridge to help me remember what she can and can't have. She especially loves carrots and will run into the kitchen whenever I start chopping any vegetables. Have you tried watermelon? I know that's usually a favorite with dogs who won't eat other fruit.

I was just appalled watching an ex (and his whole family) putting their plates on the floor after dinner. We just had spicy fajitas with onions and red chili peppers...then for dessert the dogs got to lick the chocolate pudding bowls."
"That‚Äôs like Britney Spears‚Äô song ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a girl, not yet a woman.‚Äù Well, if the English language had a word for that her song would be completely different lol"
"Lol my parents did this with me, I was massively entitled and shitty until I was about 25 or so and realized how awful of a person I was. 7 years and hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of therapy later, and I can finally consider myself a decent human being.

My sister hasn't decided to work on herself yet so she's still a ""princess""."
Put a # at the beginning of the paragraph
"While he looks lovely to me dressed up in his office wear (he tends to lean for brighter colors and patterns, especially florals). I have to say that going to see him for lunch at his job and watching this man on that formal wear with a long white doctors coat over top and stethoscope on his pocket...I've never been a territorial girl but a part of me is feeling like yep that's my man üòç lol. 

I think it's that 1) He truly is a handsome man, he's going a little salt and pepper in his beard which he hates, I love it. And 2) I know how big of an accomplishment this is for him and I'm really proud of him so I feel like it has to be translated multiple ways because I'm like overflowing lol"
"I was the target of my cousins and older brothers growing up. They thought I was really annoying. (Cousins just think whatever my brother says is true) I‚Äôd bring like five-eight books with me wherever we went and find a cool spot to read.  My mom would eventually force me to hang out with them. Then I‚Äôd walk into the cousins ‚Äòhang out space‚Äô and I‚Äôd be immediately tackled down, dirty underwear rubbed on my head and farted on by everyone. My brother would be standing there, grinning."
"In the same vein, ""Mr. Right/Mrs. Always Right"" pisses me off."
"Yeah, I've googled ""can dogs have ___________"" more times than I can count!

I'm pretty good about not giving table scraps (as in ""food that I'm now done eating""), but I love giving her meal-prep scraps. If I'm cutting up some carrots/broccoli/bell pepper/asparagus/whatever...she's getting some of that. Weird thing is, she'll take any vegetable you toss her way, but will *not* eat a piece of fruit if her life depended on it."
"If other people want to have them, good for them.  From what I've heard they're extremely painful to get, make certain clothing choices more difficult and the upside to getting one or both done for me would be totally negligible."

That's super weird. I'm so sorry.
"Wait until you meet my dad. My sister tried going to a festival in Long Beach with her boyfriend (we live about 4 hours away) and she wanted to rent an air bnb because she‚Äôd be back late and they‚Äôd both be really tired. 


My dad said no because he didn‚Äôt want his family to think that my sister was ‚Äúeasy‚Äù or that they were bad parents for letting them sleep together when otherwise they would‚Äôve been extremely tired. 

My sister is 22"
"""Protective"" stereotypes and double standards. 

My 12 year old son has a date? Nice job, that's my boy! 

My 16 year old daughter has a date? Nope, she's a good girl! 

&amp;#x200B;

My daughter came home in tears after being bullied, I hugged her and told her I love her.

My son came home in tears after being bullied, I punched him in the arm and told him to man up."
"My horse. I‚Äôd been shopping for about a year, and finally had my choice narrowed down to two. I agonized between those two for weeks, before finally commuting. That one fell through, so I planned to put an offer in for the other one. It was Friday, so I decided to wait and call on Monday.  

On Saturday, my horse popped on the market, I looked at him Sunday, paid asking price on Monday."
Usually it‚Äôs clothing that I have trouble buying. So I don‚Äôt really make t-shirts but I do a lot of skirts and dresses. I want to try jeans before the end of the year and sometimes I think about trying bras.
If it‚Äôs anything like the checks and balances of the US government I‚Äôm guessing a giant trash fire

Thank you :-)
I switched from Aquarich to Bright Milk and my skin tolerates it much better. There's still alcohol in the Bright Milk but I find it much gentler.
Mine is either first wives club or mad Max fury road
I'm so damn addicted...
"Won‚Äôt have a patch on giving birth but having the coil inserted, no one warned me how sore it would be."
"The same can go for noise on planes too. ""Oh my toddler will be so quiet, you wont even know they're here"" 

2 hours later and I'm starting to get ear tinnitus from the high pitched squealing of the kid sitting right behind me."
The idea of still being with someone I was with in high school sounds miserable haha. I had no idea what I wanted at the time.
"Parents that record and post every movement their children make online for ‚Äúlikes‚Äù. These YouTube families, the parents are down right insane, I feel so bad for the kids. I can‚Äôt imagine having my parents follow me around with a camera in my face waiting for me to ‚Äúdo something funny‚Äù. 

‚ÄúOh sorry little Billy, the video of you getting hit in the face with cheese while you slept and getting laughed at only generated 50 likes‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs embarrassing to man kind."
Don't feel guilty. I know I definitely don't. I'm taking two weeks off next month and don't feel bad at all because I know I do my work well and deserve time off. Work life balance is important for your well-being. And the boomers take vacations much more frequently haha.
"I do this too.  My sister has two kids under 5, and as small as they are, it's clear to see that they appreciate having the option."
"This is me. I hate it and my siblings tell me to take a joke or stop being sensitive but idk man, it hurts."
Well that‚Äôs true for anyone that goes there. But that‚Äôs gonna be a yikes from me
"Exactly. If my 90 pound German Shepherd jumped on someone, there would be a problem. He would be seen as dangerous.

But when a 5 pound dog jumps on you? People consider that cute."
"I think it wholly depends on the group, I‚Äôve had plenty of friends whom for their bachelor party just had a really relaxing time with their buddies, nothing crazy, maybe a bit of drinking, but overall were excited to be getting married and just wanted to share that joy with some of their closest friends"
Exactly this. That little dog was lucky it picked on a Rottweiler that was under control. One day it might try it with one that isn‚Äôt and that‚Äôll be a sorry situation for all concerned. It doesn‚Äôt need to be happening.
"Man, even when I worked retail. You'd get a kid acting up in the store and the parent would point to one of the cashiers and say, ""They're gonna kick you out of the store if you're not good!""

Like, dude, don't drag the poor employee into disciplining your hell-spawn. We can't do shit. Drag the kid's ass out yourself."
"Unlimited PTO is kind of used as a false advertisement in my experience. There might be unlimited PTO, but there‚Äôs usually an arduous process to get PTO approval quickly and if the role is anything like mine were, you rarely ever had the opportunity to actually take the entire day off. I used to think about it like my job actually gets unlimited ‚Äòme‚Äô because I‚Äôm constantly tied to my laptop or phone or email or texts."
"Don't even argue with this guy. Racist, Incel, Braindead."
"I'm sure a lot of that is projection. I have a brother who does the same thing: he'll honk at women, break his neck trying to check one out while driving, and catcall them, but heaven forbid his teenage step-daughter dresses a certain way."

Oh shit
Routine infant circumcision is fucked up. I'm so glad the rates are dropping worldwide.
"Not at all. I knew I had to get the dog off mine too because if she did decide to fight back, she would have easily killed the dog and then I would lose my dog."
Sure.  I would feel honored.
"I remember any genuine comment a dude has made when the mood was fairly intimate but not sexual. Like small phrases after looking at me silently. A dude i hadnt seen in a while sat across from me while i was sitting at the edge of his bed. He just looked at me for a minute, ran his hands down my hair and then held onto my face and told me he missed me. Another dude did something wildly similar but it was about my legs. 

Then anything about my genitals / dirty talk usually makes me blush. I cant see much myself so one time after a particularly great experience i was told in a near-brag about how swollen i was. He was so proud of himself but it was such a strange thing to hear.  Same dude had once told me to scooch  forward so he could do xyz in a very blatant way. Still makes me blush."
"I think it‚Äôs fine if you don‚Äôt know how, as long as you‚Äôre willing to learn. I always cooked and baked with my mom so I‚Äôm fine on that front, but I never did laundry because my mom did everyone‚Äôs clothes together. I‚Äôm starting college in a few days and it‚Äôll be the second time I ever do laundry, but I don‚Äôt use it as an excuse or a weird brag, I‚Äôll just have to learn how to do it."
"Wow, that's a fantastic video. I never really thought of sympathy vs. empathy before!

I really like the suggestion of, ""I don't even know what to say right now, I'm just so glad you told me"" for difficult situations.. Sometimes I really have no idea how to emphasize or help and don't know what to say, and just admitting that and offering a listening ear does seem helpful itself."
"Yeah, that‚Äôs one reason we decided to just not change anything, cause he seems happy now, and the vet says he‚Äôs fine, just chunky lol. We tried doing the diet thing and he got GRUMPY lol, so we‚Äôre just gonna let him do what he wants as long as the vet says he‚Äôs healthy, also he‚Äôs stayed the same weight for like 5 or 6 years now so it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs getting worse."
"Barney's a *dinosaur*, not an animal.  Try to keep up, huh?"
"I think this is the exact reason that I was afraid to have boy friends until I was like 20. I thought every guy who was nice to me was trying to flirt with me, and I was terrified of being friendly back for fear of leading them on."
"My half sister had my mother walk her down the aisle because she never really had a relationship with her father (my ex step father) who was in prison most of her life growing up. I don't think I'll ask either of my parents to walk me down if I ever get married just because I'm not a traditional person, but I understand your point. It frustrates me too. And I'm truly sorry to hear about your mom."
"I love it when it's over something you did when you were younger and stupid.

Yes guys it's very funny to pick on me, a now 29 year old, because 13 year old me went from having 0 sibling responsibility to losing my weekend so I can watch a 7 and 5 year old because ""daddy is sick and no you can't see him."" (He tried to commit suicide but I didn't find this out til waaaaayyy after the damage was done. So 13 year old was old enough to know something bad happened but thought it was a deadly illness and that my dad was going to die before I got to see him again) 

Like sorry that you thought your 13 year old couldn't handle knowing what depression was but that she was mature enough to know how to take care of a 7 year old who doesn't even listen to you and picks on his younger sister."
This one hits too close to home lmaooo
Childbirth.
"Well, I think nobody is mentioning it because this is ""AskWomen"" so you're gonna get answers skewed towards women's issues.

I never feel comfortable jumping into this particular debate because I don't have the requisite equipment. 

I feel like it's wrong. The data doesn't seem to support a medical reason for it, so why do it? If I had a son, I probably would vote no, but would give my husband's opinion more weight in the matter, because he would have a better understanding of it.

But every time the argument comes up on Reddit, it seems like 50% of guys are against and 50% are for it. The guy's who have had it done seem to be ok with it. The guy's who haven't had seem to be happy not having had it, so idk.

But it seems wrong to chop something off for no reason."
So i havent given birth or passed a stone so I cant beat those but a women with long nails chipped my labia once and that hurt like a motherfucker.
"The wedding wasn‚Äôt too bad despite the bride being a huge gold digger, the worst part was I was the only one out of all my cousins that wasn‚Äôt allowed to bring a partner. My uncle and more my auntie thought I was gay....

Spoiler: I‚Äôm not"
"I wouldn't say this was bad, more funny looking back but I went to a wedding where the person officiating forgot to say ""you may all be seated"" after the bride walked in and all the guests (myself included) stood for the entire ceremony"
It‚Äôs taken me a few listens but I‚Äôm really starting to love LDR‚Äôs new album. And Lord Huron is always on repeat for me.
"He never even once remotely questioned me or my story. He never blamed me or asked why I didn‚Äôt do things different. He didn‚Äôt chastise me for going out drinking with my friend. He didn‚Äôt pry me for details. He just hugged me and let me cry. I spoke with him at a later time about it, and he said those thoughts never even crossed his mind."

"There was no dancing (which wasn't why it was bad, I've been to other weddings with no dancing and they've been fun). 

To make up for the no dancing thing, they made us watch the bride and groom play a bunch of games (think the shoe game, blindfolded trying to find your new wife's hands, etc). Then we had to sit while the entire wedding party gave speeches. Four bridesmaids, four groomsmen, two sets of parents and the bride and groom. I think it was over an hour? Then we sat through a slideshow of pictures that went on for three songs. I think in total we were sitting for two hours. 

My butt hurt by the end of it. And leaving early was super awkward because you had to get up from your seat as everyone watched. I actually used this wedding as a what-not-to-do example when I got married. 

Please, don't make your speeches long. I know you, as the one who is getting married, loves hearing about how much people love you. But  most of your guests are just waiting for them to be over. Short and sweet is the way to go. Also, the proper way to do a no-dancing wedding is to just let people mingle and socialize the whole night. People like that."
Very true and another sad part is a lot of people also practice self-judgement about their spendings. I know because I did too when I was broke. Until it hit me life isn't just paying the bills and it gets depressing AF to do nothing but pay the bills for such long periods of time.

"I was probably in grade 1 and my parents dragged me and my younger brother along to this wedding down in the boonies of the province. It was really hot that weekend and we were staying in our camper. My brother and I‚Äôs comfort levels were already compromised because of the heat and being stuffed into formal wear.

Anyways. We go through the ceremony. We roast some more. The evening is getting later; we‚Äôre getting more tired and hot by the minute. Parents didn‚Äôt seem to care at that point because there was booze (dad is an alcoholic and mom is now a recovering alcohol.. booze came first a lot in my childhood unfortunately). At the banquet, I was hit with the worst growing pains I had ever experienced in my life. I couldn‚Äôt stop crying. My brother, bless him, is tired and hot and is sympathy crying at this point. Parents decided to take us back to the camper because ‚Äúwe were making a scene‚Äù.

We get back to the camper and my dad proceeds to tell us how we ruined everything, ruined their friendship with the parents of the bride, and they were never taking us anywhere again because we were terrible (all of course while consuming more booze because why not). So between the growing pains and my father making me feel like I was a burden/I was the cause of the misery in their lives, it was a really terrible night.

I‚Äôd really like to say it didn‚Äôt affect my self worth because it was a stupid drunken incident, but damn did it hurt. It also put a really bad taste in my mouth about going to weddings because of the association with that incident."
Thanks. Yea I think I should try it again.
Was it in Taplow House Hotel by any chance? :D
"What on earth inspired the priest to talk shit about people with an illness? ""Praise the Lord, we are all made in his image - except sick people. Fuck those guys."""
"We ‚Äúgrocery shopped‚Äù at my grandmothers house when I was a kid. 

As an adult I‚Äôve done far better but getting to the point of financial stability took a decade. People don‚Äôt think about what it takes to dig yourself out of childhood poverty. Especially when everyone you are related to is just as poor and there is no option of help from family. 

I literally worked 2 or 3 jobs in my 20s and over time I was able to learn how to manage finances and gain skills. I eventually got myself to a place where I could attend school in my 30s (with the help of student loans) and now I have 1 good job, my own home, and I‚Äôm stable. Starting graduate school in the fall of this year in my late 30s. Not rich, but doing well enough to help my family when needed and enjoy my life. 

To do this I had to be very intentional and make a lot of calculated and difficult decisions. I lived in a run down apartment for 6 years while going to school and working 1 job that was great for my resume but did not pay well. Eventually I worked my way up to management in that job and was able to buy a home in a good neighborhood. While I was in the old apartment there was an arson that killed a man, 2 stabbings, multiple drug raids, drug court neighbors, bedbugs, I was followed home, and chased by bounty hunters who thought I was someone else. 

My friends would not come over, I was ok with that, but they also didn‚Äôt understand why I lived there. It‚Äôs hard to explain to people whose parents have a summer home on the lake why you can‚Äôt move out of the ghetto. They just don‚Äôt get it. 

Food and gas where always an issue for me. Once I went on a camping trip with friends where we ended up spending more than I could afford on food. I didn‚Äôt say anything but I realized I wouldn‚Äôt be able to buy groceries for home the next week. When we were heading home my friend started to throw away the rest of the soggy bread and other mismatched things but I stopped her and put them in my bag. She looked at me like she was disgusted but I took that stuff home and it helped get me through the week."
"My cousin‚Äôs...it was outdoors at a pond on the family ranch. The theme was ‚ÄúCowboys (her) and bikers (her husband.) She and my uncle &amp; cousin (the bridal party) rode over a hill on horseback (‚Äúwalking down the aisle‚Äù) and when they got to where they were supposed to say their vows she yells ‚ÄúFUCK THIS‚Äù and they turned their horses and rode away. They came back (big joke hahaha) and waited on the groom and groomsmen to ride up on their Harley‚Äôs. Except one Harley broke down and so the guy was on a mini-dirt bike. They were all drunk and my parents, sister and I were the only ones dressed up. People were cracking open beers during the vows which included the word ‚Äúfuck.‚Äù Super classy. No they‚Äôre not married anymore (shocker I know!)"
"My mom forgives far too much and had the audacity to tell me to tolerate more things (think creepy uncle types and abusive fathers). I told her rather than telling me to tolerate more, she should tolerate less! You should be happy your daughter says no when she's uncomfortable. Fuck that noise. I won't apologize for asking someone to respect my boundaries."
They‚Äôre still together 9 years on. I think they‚Äôve managed to stay married by barely speaking to each other and just sort of existing in the same house. It‚Äôs very weird. Neither of them seem happy.

Let us know how the 5th one goes.
"What's crazy to me is that they didn't have the ""goodie box"" in the ladies room. Every wedding I've ever been to had hair spray, Bobbie pins, mouth wash, tampons, pads, qtips etc etc in the bathroom."
"I really liked The Good Place! I would guess at almost equal gender diversity, good racial diversity too. And while it was less diverse in terms of LGBTQ+ there was a definite bi vibe from Eleanor."
It‚Äôs taken me a few listens but I‚Äôm really starting to love LDR‚Äôs new album. And Lord Huron is always on repeat for me.
"Leaving your guests without food, booze and music is not part of that tradition, though, but bad organisation."
Always being too busy to go out with me and always telling me he‚Äôs going out with friends
Were the cabins named after Iroquois Nations?
Once. But that‚Äôs because I exclusively wear sports bras and they get filthy. When I wore underwire bras I‚Äôd wear them until they smelled weird.
Crikey. Maybe the fifth one will be better.
"Oh, you've described roughly half of all the weddings I've attended. So much crepe paper everywhere. I've been to a few that were so small, it was just in the relief society room. Those are actually a bit better.

On the plus side, they were always short. But since there's only punch and maybe a brownie, it's not expected you stay all night. There's also the dreaded line to stand in"
"Jane the Virgin. I heard it was the final season, so it felt safe to binge. It was largely adorable, though season five was a bit hard to swallow."
Ahhhhh omg. So cringy lol.

"THIS. the older I‚Äôve gotten I look back at some female ‚Äúfriendships‚Äù I had and I realize I was so

For me it was the other way round. When I moved out from my parents and first started dating and working etc. I had to learn to give people a 2nd chance and that after an argument people will meet me half way and it would be unfair if i didn‚Äôt go the other half.
"Hahaha, your husband is awesome"
I was coming on here to say first wives club! I have you don‚Äôt own me stick in my head now!
Camp Seneca Lake?
"I try to alternate between two during the week so one doesn‚Äôt get too sweaty and stretched out. So that‚Äôs like 3-4 times before washing once a week. But if it starts to smell, then into the laundry basket."
"It was a very small wedding. Right before starting the groom's mother started rambling to the pastor how it's ok for her son to marry again bc his ex cheated on him and he didn't do anything wrong to cause their divorce, it was all the ex's fault, etc (from 10 yrs ago). All in front of the new bride. It was kinda rude in my opinion to even bring that up, no?"
"I wouldn't say this was bad, more funny looking back but I went to a wedding where the person officiating forgot to say ""you may all be seated"" after the bride walked in and all the guests (myself included) stood for the entire ceremony."
Yes... And now I need to forget it again.
"If you want your bride, buy us a drink!"
Moving countries sounds like a hell of a change!
"In all fairness, how close could you really be if you didn‚Äôt know he was her ex? How far out are you extending girl code? When it comes to dating, I‚Äôm only concerned with my friends. Outside of that it‚Äôs fair game. So sorry bestie, your cousins ex isn‚Äôt a stop for me."
"Definitely if they are very touchy-feely when previously they were not. Mostly it‚Äôs how close they get when talking to me, like you‚Äôre standing right next to me and it‚Äôs not very loud in this room but you feel the need to talk directly into my ear for everything you say."

"Carnivals/fairs are great in my experience, if you're lucky enough for one to be happening nearby. Lots of different things to do to keep a date from awkwardly stalling."
"I don‚Äôt have an interest in threesomes. I‚Äôm a ‚Äúselfish lover‚Äù. I like knowing it‚Äôs mine and only mine. I will do al kinds of freaky things, but stories like these make my decision to stay away from adding extra players to the bed a hard ‚Äúno‚Äù"
Don‚Äôt you wish the person could just doubtedly know when they have received Karma and from *what*
I‚Äôm 24 and still have some stuffed animals. I love my  pandas especially :D
"Dude is the best person I know, seriously is. BUT just because he's a person I admire, care about and get along with doesn't mean that I will be in love and we are compatible long term. It took me a long time to realize that I just really like this guy as a person/as a friend and our priorities were different. We had goals that were taking us to opposite sides of the country which was already a good reason but he wanted to settle down and make roots and I didn't . Just because a relationship is not bad isn't a reason to stay. It's unfair to both people and makes you kinda a shitty person if you're stringing this person along knowing you don't love them. I cut things off immediately after realizing my feelings. We're still friends and want each other to be happy. 

If I stayed I don't think I'd be miserable but there was always a something is missing feeling...a longing for something even though life wasn't bad. I met my husband a few years later and don't feel that way with life with him."
A dream is a wish your heart makes
"I‚Äôm politically engaged. There‚Äôs a billion things that are going wrong at any given moment, but if I can do my part and put some good into this world and help build a future I believe in, then I can take comfort in working on a path to that future."
"I've had to go to go without serious medications because I couldn't afford them (heart meds and I detoxed off of strong pysch meds once, that was truely awful).

I've also stolen food quite a few times to make sure we could eat. From stores and from my roommates. It really got to me when I realized for a week straight I was eating less than 500 calories a day because I just simply couldn't afford food and I'd buy dog food before I did food for myself.

I'm doing much, much better off financially now. But yeah. It can be rough."
Whoa ... that one sounds worth the money. How amazing. How long ago are they as happy as their wedding sounds?
"&gt; Why are people even commenting if they claim they don‚Äôt even know who these people are?

"I suppose there‚Äôs no way to be 100% sure, but I made my choice to trust him.  Her story was so wildly full of impossibilities, dramatics, and lies that I made my decision to trust him, but it took a long time.  She couldn‚Äôt keep a single story straight, her facts would constantly change, and when people would ask more she‚Äôd just cry to get out of answering.

Yeah. It really is - she should be nowhere near this kind of work and I don't know what to do about it.

"I don‚Äôt despise her at all, and still miss her.  However, I could no longer watch her be treated horribly by men and then come running for me when she needed to vent and cry to someone.  The straw that finally broke the camels back was her dating a registered sex offender and putting up with him cheating on her and just treating her horribly.  She has an 8 year old son which was hard to watch her put him in that situation with this guy living with them."
"A band I worked with was booked to play some fancy wedding in a large city in the middle of the US. After the ceremony, they couldn't find the lead singer... Yep.

"&gt;Simply sharing their life in front of a camera is not 'empowering'

I agreed. 


The ""youtube stars""(I should have called them famous youtubers instead) are vast and different types of people, I agree and I probably don't know most of them either lol. 

I actually never considered them as much of celebrity or something, but they are very popular in twitter, so I thought people probably think about them differently or something is probably great about them that I am missing out. 

My curiosity is mainly for famous woman youtubers only, so I thought I should ask here to learn about women's viewpoints or if they see them as an icon of empowerment (I don't know about famous man youtubers much, I did not even know what is pewdipie until few months ago haha)."

"I went through a phase where I thought 99% of the significance of things taking place was beneath the surface. I thought I was 1% as smart as everyone else and when they spoke or did anything such as dance, etc, there was 99% of meaning that was going over my head. 

I thought it was why I couldn't dance, why girls found me so boring, why I wasn't funny, why I couldn't win arguments, why I didn't fit in with the guys... I believed I was missing the larger chunk of social significance. And even more depressingly, I believed that no one I ever asked could see the 99% or would tell me how to see it."

"Probably too late to the party but here goes

I've told this story before in brief but the worst wedding I have ever been to was a family friend wedding. This lady is crazy. Like loveable, fun, accept her as she is kind of crazy but try not to spend one on one time with her. Everyone knows one. Well she's getting married (she's been close about 3 or 4 times) and we're all sitting in this fancy place waiting for the ceremony to start. And I start cracking up bc I'm the first of my family to notice that she has A FRAMED PHOTO of my dead brother right up on the side of the alter. 

For context, my brother dated her before I was born and broke it off after only a few months bc well.... the lady is crazy. She's always been a weird family friend hanger on bc in my culture that's just how it is. Fast forward about 30 years and within that timeframe my brother has married, had children, and died (unrelated reasons to the story). This lady has apparently never gotten over the ""one who got away""and so always introduced herself as the almost daughter in law, etc. 

So here we all are at this wedding ready to witness her being taken away from our family for good when I noticed the photo. Not even an old photo from a time in their life together, just the generic one used in his obituary etc. The man had been dead for quite some time now. It was all just so bizarre. Throughout the entire ceremony my family could barely keep it together; my mother just kept whispering Catholic prayers  (we're definitely not Catholic), my sisters are trying to take photos of this whole scene for future levity, and my poor sister in law is hunched over absolutely crying from laughing so hard. Unfortunately no one else knew and so the wedding was stopped bc the bride thought she was legit crying and made some sappy speech about true loves *with her almost husband standing right in front of her* and by this point we had so given up. 

The marriage lasted four months so she's ours again. Sigh."
"About 23 years! I took a job straight out of college where I was treated like a professional doormat. I ended up exploding when a coworker made a huge scene in front of other colleagues after I asked her for a ride to the airport from the conference we were at. I told her to go f*** herself, among other things. I haven‚Äôt snapped like that since but it definitely gave me the courage I needed to stand up for myself when I‚Äôm treated unfairly."
The shannarah Chronicles
"An abusive fuckhead and I broke up. Made a new friend, a while later, who had also been assaulted in the past, by a partner, and the shared experience was kind of the foundation of our friendship. She knew everything that happened and the ways I was struggling because of it. My mother even took her in for a bit when there was trouble in her home. We had an ACS worker come to our house because of it, where we defended her reasons for not going back home.

Then I notice she starts talking about my ex a lot. Like a joke she overheard him make, how well he played guitar. Eventually she said they were friends and I told her, ""fine. just don't talk to me about him, I don't want to hear it."" Then she started talking about a ""guy"" she had a crush on but wouldn't tell me who. 

It was my ex! Turns out she was having sex with him for a while. Also turns out that the two of them were sitting around laughing about what he did to me (overheard by a mutual friend). Our friendship ended.

After a while, I guess she wanted a relationship with him and he turned her down. She tried to come to me, crying about how he used her for sex and lied when he said he loved her. 

We were young, still are, but not young enough for that to ever feel okay to me. You don't start fucking your friend's rapist ex and then look for her shoulder to cry on when he treated you like shit. Especially when she's not the only one who has said he raped her. 

I can't imagine a bigger violation. And because I can't imagine a bigger violation, I'd just like to say fuck Ani from 13 Reasons and how sympathetically her character is portrayed makes me feel gross inside."
Gaston's got a pretty great villain song I think.
"Had my first lap surgery last Thursday and according to my gyno, I've got advanced endometriosis... hormone therapy and several other surgeries will follow.

I always figured that having kids might be tricky (women in my family generally do), but I'm still devastated and feel depressed. I thought things were looking up finally due to finally getting my teaching degree, having a good job (even if it's temporary), but since my gyno found the first huge cyst, it just got worse and worse.

My SO is very supportive, but we're still long distance right now and Brexit is looming above our heads too. Seeing my friends getting engaged, getting married, travelling or just having kids makes me envious as heck."
That sounds exactly like my mother's wedding! Minus the looking like her brother part
"I love Cristine. She's such a good role model for young people.

Eta: Jenna is also cool in the way that she doesn't give a hoot about what's expected of her from society. She's unapologetically herself in all her videos."
"Glad to hear you got your cat back! 

How is she trying to get in to this kind of work? Is there a particular agency/advocacy group she is trying to work with? Can you speak to the people she is applying with about your experiences with her, and your concerns about her representing survivors and those who are vulnerable?  


Of course don't do anything if it could put you in a bad position (legally, emotionally etc), you need to take care of you. But the thought of this kind of person having a position of influence over those who are very vulnerable makes my stomach turn."

"Were you a friend of the bride/what is she like? Also, good lord that mother. Everything was ""eh"" until that last sentence, then, damn."
Or eloping . I have a feeling not many will go to that marriage.
"Of course - grey area abounds. I have dated guys that previous friends - more like acquaintances -  dated, so have been on the other side. It just depends on the level of friendship and the scenario. No one size fits all - but I do think there are certain boundaries that are good to respect. I think a lot of the weirdness happens with younger people in HS/college/early 20's who haven't yet been burned."
*Oh my god they were roomates*
"I like learning biology. Specifically cell biology. I learned this in like 5th or 7th grade, I don't remember exactly. I decided it was my main interest in college when I made it my major, though. Can't seem to manage to turn it into a job :/"
"My best and only friend at the time, 8th grade. She gave my boyfriend-at-the-time my social media passwords so he could internet bully me. She was jealous that I was dating the guy she thought she deserved more. I guess. They both shared my personal convos, my private coming out as bi, shameful secrets, all over school. When I came to school oblivious the next day, they were holding hands, kissing, and flipping me off. No one would be seen with me. Rekindled things later with the ultimatum that I'd apologize to her for it. The whole friendship was toxic. She hated me through all of it. But she was my sister and I loved her anyway. I needed her to love me. After high school she moved across the country, we drifted apart. When I tried to make things right and reconnect, she permanently ghosted.... The reason? She thought I wanted to be with her 6-hour flight away boyfriend...? the irony still kills me. Many variations of girl code broken. It was honestly for the best."
What a horrible thing to do! I hope you didn't approve when she told you that.
"My best friend picked my exs side over me. It really sucked. They were friends too but you would think she would stick by my side. I didn't cheat on the guy or anything, but we were massively not compatible and I broke up with him, changed my mind and got back with him. This really pissed off my friend. I wasnt trying to hurt anyone but I was confused. Eventually the guy and I split up for good. 

Now she doesnt even talk to the guy and we both moved across the country and live in the same town. We're closer than ever. We both did have a talk about all that happened and promised to communicate more openly."
"Oh and B\*x if you're out there seeing this.... go fuck yourself you boring, dumb bitch! :) You made my life really hard! So glad you have zero career to match your zero personality. 

Nope, having an unpopular instagram where you pretend to be something in fashion by having your rich family pay for you to get into shit fashion shows during fashion week doesnt count!"
Preach.
"Boy crazy friends are impossible. They will never put a friendship first. Even though it hurts, it's truly their loss. It will hit them like a ton of bricks one day and no one will be around to console them."
"Yeah. A creeping sense of dread that they‚Äôre going to try to talk to me about stupid shit I don‚Äôt care about.

When they started dating I thought she was telling me as a prank. He never made any attempt to apologize or get to know me- just ignored me when I was around. But whatever not a big deal he made her happy. 

After we graduated she was a bridesmaid in my wedding. 

A year later I wasn‚Äôt invited to hers. No explanation. But I found out through a mutual friend it was because she ‚Äúfelt funny because I didn‚Äôt like her husband.‚Äù"
"I went through the same exact thing. Such a mindfuck. Some people just feel the need to crush souls like theirs are crushed, I guess."
"He is kind and smart and wonderful! I may be a little biased, but I fell for him when he texted me pictures of spreadsheets he made to map his personal electrical usage. He is in the other room running the cnc to make a heat brand that he 3d modeled earlier today. He gives the best hugs, believed in me when I got laid off after we lost a huge contract. He encourages me to do my best and to try new things. I've never heard him say that I can't do something. He gets excited with me, and is just fun to be around. Lucky me, I get to marry him :)"
"Same thing happened to me, except it was my friends boyfriend. He was ‚Äúthe hottie‚Äù in high school and people said I should feel lucky because they wish it happened to them. Definitely the reason I refuse to be alone with anyone since"
"She was body-shaming me behind my back. I'm a little bit overweight, mostly in the belly area... Even though I don't carry my weight all that well, I know how to dress to flatter my body shape. We were really good friends. I felt comfortable getting changed in front of her etc. and vice versa.

She would say things to my other friends behind my back like ""I would hate to be that size..."" and ""How do you just let yourself go"". She would make a puke-face and say ""Have you seen the size of her stomach?"" To all my other friends. 

When I found out through another friend - whom I'm still friends with. I asked her in a very non-confrontational way and she admitted it and said that everyone knew I was big and that she was the only one brave enough to say it. She went on and on saying that I can only blame myself for my excess weight (I already knew it's my own fault. I may be a little fat but I'm not stupid) and that I was overreacting.  

It happened a while ago. I don't talk to her anymore but see her around from time to time. I'm still a bit overweight. She's still slim. I get this really awful feeling she's still bitching about my body behind my back. But I stopped caring about her and our friendship a very long time ago"
"Not sure if this is ‚Äúbreaking girl code‚Äù or just a shitty thing to do, but she slept with my boyfriend because she was mad at me."
"It was extremely kind of you to warn your friend and try to keep her from getting hurt, despite how she treated you. You clearly are a treasure of a friend to have and anyone who can‚Äôt see what a valuable friend you are doesn‚Äôt deserve your friendship."
"No, I wouldn't, but it's cool that a product like that exists"
Great! My parents are very accepting people. As long as I‚Äôm happy they‚Äôre happy.
"She‚Äôs been going through a tough time but this girl knows about all of the shit and problems I have with my dad and she still asked. When he told me my heart dropped. 

He is married to my stepmom which makes me even more mad because that‚Äôs my family she‚Äôs messing with. 


I took her off all of my social media and went ghost. Fuck that."
It's fine.
him saying ‚Äúi have a crush on you‚Äù
"It is ok to contact her organization, as a survivor of sexual assault yourself, and inform them of your perception of her ability to work with sexual assault victims. You were sexually assaulted. She did not believe you or support you. The same man sexually assaulted another friend. She backed the offender on both occasions. They can do what they want with that information. 

You do not need to go into what she did or did not say or anything nuanced that might be slandering her character (before anyone @s me, I know it‚Äôs likely not slander, but have you been on the end of a slander lawsuit? It is stressful, time consuming, and money will be spent. Source: am lawyer, would not recommend)."
"Don‚Äôt misunderstand. 

I have social skills. 

I don‚Äôt fear being around people. I dislike being around people. Big difference."
They can make you feel awkward?
You‚Äôre more forgiving than many people would be. I hope your friend appreciates that.
"*sends out the tightest of hugs* Come here, you."
"Told her something I was upset about at work and wanted her opinion on how to bring it up to our boss. She went behind my back and told my boss about it, which pushed her career ahead and fucked mine up considerably."
"One of my best friend‚Äôs had his wedding at their ranch in the Ozarks. It was sunny, the scenery was stunning, and the food was amazing (smoked pulled pork). Our crew rented a cabin close to there to stay in and we had an absolute blast.. we even stopped at Lambert‚Äôs Cafe in Ozark on the way back to Oklahoma to enjoy some ‚Äúthrowed rolls‚Äù. That‚Äôs one weekend I could happily go back to again and again!"
Enchiladas. My mom makes the best enchiladas. I introduced my bf to my mom's food and he can't even eat Mexican food at restaurants anymore because it doesn't meet his expectations.
"Baggy/too big a suit jacket. Not just slightly too big because its  not tailered to them, but when it's clearly a full size wrong. Looks unprofessional and just messy."
I just think a lot of redditors think it's cool to be misanthropic. It's like advanced emo.
Best friend since the 7th grade fucked my husband.
"&gt; I couldn‚Äôt believe it because he‚Äôd treated me so badly and _**she was on my side the whole time**_

Lol she wasn't on your side, she was making an opening for herself. Crappy ""friend""."
My grandma judged my mom's choice of couch color from 25ish years ago. The couches ended up being a different color and my grandma legit was roasting my mom for an opinion she had that long ago.
"I had been seeing a guy for a couple months, the first man I was really excited about dating since my terrible divorce a couple years ago. I thought maybe there was hope for finding someone again. Then he changed his mind and decided he didn‚Äôt have time to date me (?)

I confided in my friend that I was pretty bummed out by the whole situation. A few days later AT WORK IN FRONT OF PEOPLE she said ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt meet guys on fuck apps and then get sad they don‚Äôt call you‚Äù because I had met him on Tinder. 

I don‚Äôt tell her things anymore and our friendship will never be the same honestly."
This 100%
Just attending. Thanks for the advice!
"Wait, what happened next? Did you and the work rival fall passionately in love after years of sexual tension-fraught bickering?"
They will go away eventually.
I wear it when I feel like I need to be a little bit more dressed up than usual.

"He gets annoyingly clingy, and always shows up wherever you go, even though you dont consider him a close friend"
"First time I ever said I would never have kids, I was probably... 12? Now I'm 24 and I have yet to even waver in that decision, ever. I don't want kids. I don't feel fond or warm or motherly when thinking about kids. I see far, far, far more kids who have nasty attitudes and who have terrible or absentee parenting, so my idea of kids is very negative. And above all, I don't think it's moral of me to bring a life that never consented to exist into a world I know is unfair and has more unpleasant, unkind people than not. That is my personal decision and I'll keep sticking to it."
"Totally. Most of my breakups are faded memories, but like 17 years later THIS is what hurts."
Trimmed. I‚Äôve been with guys who shave all of it and it just seems a little weird to me
"My best friend at the time talked to my boyfriend without me knowing, told him I was sleeping with a mutual friend (I wasn‚Äôt), and convinced him to sleep with her for revenge.  I don‚Äôt speak to either of them anymore."
"I don‚Äôt really feel this was a violation though. He clearly wanted to surprise her and I presume you thought he would be a good match for her, which is why you helped and kept the secret. This one is on her hubby for blabbing."

"A day after I broke up with my ex, my roommate asked if she could hang out with him ‚Äúas friends‚Äù over a school break, and I uncomfortably said ‚ÄúI guess so,‚Äù since I wouldn‚Äôt be back for like a month and a half. I also warned her about his tendencies and why she shouldn‚Äôt hang out with him. Then I was gone for one week and she texted me saying they both fell in love and decided to date and I couldn‚Äôt believe it because he‚Äôd treated me so badly and she was on my side the whole time when I vented to her about him, and she told me ‚Äúsome people just don‚Äôt click.‚Äù"

"Trying to get my boyfriend to cheat with her. But as I often say, that's less girl code and more basic human decency.

Still, it's something I'd never do to another woman, and would expect other women to be better than that."
I'd ask him if he's lost his mind.
omfg. painful
Once. I am a sweaty human and I don‚Äôt feel clean if I rewear bras.
lmao what was in the power point?
Do you ever post anything that isn't thought up by your dick?
"I've only been to three weddings so my worst one wasn't really that bad and the other two were amazing. But it was for an orthodox Jewish couple and during the whole reception the men and women were separated by a huge wall. It was very strange, and as a nonreligious person, it felt sexist. 

I was visiting from out of state, so it's not like I was looking to meet anyone. But it still felt wrong on some level. I drove 14 hours to get there and only got to spend time with half of my cousins."
Oh dear God. This reminds me of my first ever kiss in high school. It was so awful that I cried afterwards because I couldn't believe I would have to do that for the rest of my life.
Heaven
"Girl we mutually knew was assaulted, tried to come forward about it.  
  
My friend publicly disputed her version and tore her down to a ton of people, saying he wasn‚Äôt that kind of guy and she was crazy, etc.  
  
It was the same guy who had assaulted me the year prior but that I couldn‚Äôt prove, and she knew about it.  
  
Broke our friendship because I supported the other girl with her report."
"Yes, it‚Äôs annoying."
Til it smells. I wear the same one bra 99% of the time and usually wash it about once a week or less. Then I might wear another bra if that one‚Äôs wet. The other bras? Can‚Äôt even remember the last time I washed them!

Big props for actually going though with it. I would‚Äôve told them to ‚Äúfuck off‚Äù if I was asked to essentially wear a fat suit so others don‚Äôt feel bad about themselves.
"I totally agree with your unpopular opinion. While I think it is possible to do a nice wedding on a shoestring budget, it takes an exceptional amount of creativity and work to do so."
"My own. Husband (now ex) showed up with a new tattoo, a bad attitude and a boil on his ass. My baby niece screamed through the whole ceremony as our pastor was so nervous she spend through it so quietly the audience couldn‚Äôt hear anything. 

At the reception no fewer then 3 people threaten his life if he hurt me during their speeches. 

He then proceeded to ignore me the rest of the day, hanging out with his friends and chain smoking in the parking lot.

Oh, and our budget was under $1000 because my dad, who offered to pay for it didn‚Äôt actually approve of it so he decided to be cheap. Then ‚Äúgifted‚Äù us a honey moon we never actually got.

Thankfully my divorce was a much happier affair."
"As some of the other stories on here go, this is pretty tame, but:

* Super christian family.  Nothing wrong with that in and of itself but as a non-religious person, I found all the talk about how God is the most important person in the marriage to be a little tedious.
* Long ceremony filled with ever lame wedding tradition you can think of - sand ceremony AND a unity candle.
* The couple was young and broke, but still wanted to have a massive wedding inviting everyone they've ever met in their life.  250-300 guests, rented a massive ball room.  Again, this is fine, but because of that, they skimped on things like food.  It was an evening wedding (ceremony at 4 pm, reception at 6:00 pm), but it was a ""dessert"" reception which consisted of one massive wedding cake (which of course couldn't be cut until the end) and a handful of apothecary jars full of hard candy.  Not even good hard candy, but like, the stuff you grandma keeps in the bottom of her purse and the stuff that is probably 25% chalk dust.  I was starving.
* No booze.  Again, super christian family.   Not even a cash bar for their non christian friends.
* The venue was gorgeous and an enviable place to have a wedding, but  the lack of food and drink made it really unenjoyable.
* The bride and groom had a photo session after the ceremony and didnt show up until almost 7:30, and by that point, some of the people who had come to the reception, saw there was no food or booze, got fed up and went to McDonalds
* It was mid-march in New England so the weather was shit.
* Bride insisted on formal dress (black tie)

I basically used this a template for everything not to do at my wedding:

* Eloped
* Backyard reception
* Good food
* LOTS of Booze and non booze drinks (for my Christian friends)
* Casual dress code
* Small guest list (immediate family and close friends, like 40 people max)

There's nothing wrong with having a big wedding, but if you do, please consider the comfort of your guests over appearences.

Edited to Add: Another wedding I was actually in had the groom shoving caked in the bride's face after she asked him not to, and she went into the bathroom and cried cause it had gotten all over her dress, which had been both her mother's and her grandmother's dress, and the dye from the icing stained it.  She was upset from all the stress and the stain and him not doing as she asked.  They are divorced now. (not because of that)"
"Neither? 

The only thing I can imagine loving unconditionally is my child. I don‚Äôt think you can have that in a relationship. 

I can also provide for myself quite well. I don‚Äôt need it from someone else. I don‚Äôt want someone to provide for me nor would I stay with someone because they can provide for me."
I predict we‚Äôll come full circle eventually and people will start covering up more. Basically what‚Äôs happened in the past.
"My rich uncle's daughter was getting married, so it was a very regal event. Lots of people. They had a cocktail hour that felt like 2 hours. So people were getting very drunk. My family has a lot of drinkers (and a few straight up alcohols), so many of us were well into our cups before we sat down to eat. Unfortunately, they only gave us one cup of water and then only refilled the champagne glass. Every time I asked for water, it took forever to get there. It was surf and turf, and it took 2 hours overall to eat, with almost instant refills of champagne. Everyone was at a super fancy wedding and completely plastered. This led to some of my cousins being unable to stand, and more than one trying to start fights. 

When I planned my dinner, I planned it during the day, in part to save money and also to not have drunk family members (open bar, but during lunch time). I also made sure food was served quickly (kids first)."
"I was at a ‚Äúcheap and cheerful‚Äù casual wedding where I was doing the wedding photography as a favour to the bride. Just before we were doing the family group photographs we were waiting for the bride and I made some small talk with her mother.

Me: ‚ÄúHow do you feel?‚Äù

Her: ‚ÄúAbsolutely relieved.‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúAh because the ceremony‚Äôs over and it‚Äôs now party time?‚Äù

Her: ‚ÄúNo. [Bride‚Äôs name] is a difficult girl. Very strange. Never thought we‚Äôd find somebody to marry her. I don‚Äôt particularly like [Groom‚Äôs name], but she‚Äôs his responsibility now. If she got hit by a truck tomorrow he would be the one to have to deal with it.‚Äù

*silence*

I‚Äôm very fucking glad the bride wasn‚Äôt around to hear it. Plus my feelings about taking this woman‚Äôs picture had totally changed.

Incidentally the couple divorced less than a year later. I hope she finds someone who supports her more than her mum did."
Oh my gosh growing pains! Those things were awful. I remember several stories of just crying pain and dying for Tylenol
"Unfortunately, it's true.  The child had the same teeth, a bald head for way too long, and it was somewhat cone shaped.  She would also sort of hiss at people and scowl.  I heard later that things improved and I'm so glad.  No child should have been burdened like that.  It was also somewhat of a surprise as both parents were pretty attractive.  Given the later history/known information, I wonder if the mother had been drinking/doing drugs during her pregnancy."
"This happens with how my children are treated by my husbands family.  It‚Äôs always the best for everyone else and little or nothing for myself and my children.  This makes me very angry, but it‚Äôs not my family it‚Äôs my husbands family.  I‚Äôve told him how I feel about the situation, but he doesn‚Äôt do anything about it."
"It's aggravating for sure. I can understand why these policies exist, but they're nevertheless wasteful. We, who had significant trouble getting food, were horrified at the waste"
"I have a huge model of the Enterprise D. You hit different buttons and the warp nacelles light up and there's some recordings of Captain Picard saying various things like ""warp speed!"" and ""red alert!"""
I'd break up with him. That's a hard no for me.
"Honestly, I don‚Äôt find much difference from before. Everyone says ‚Äúmarriage is different‚Äù ‚Äúmarriage is hard work‚Äù, etc, but we lived together and had a kid together, and then got married, so I suppose our relationship was already established enough that a ceremony and piece of paper didn‚Äôt really change anything. So, in short, I like it just fine!"
"This wedding I went to recently where the catering was absolute garbage.

The food was dripping with oil and oversalted. Could barely eat it. It also looked terribly unappetizing. Then for some reason they decided to put the garbage cans for throwing away the disposable plates in the middle of the food area. I very nearly threw up. And the dessert was some bad quality ice cream I didn't touch, but my brother had some and immediately developed a cold. 

The rest of the wedding looked well organized and like they had spent a lot of money, so I don't understand why the catering was so pathetic."
"Similar to the other comment, i can provide enough for myself and a partner (unless their needs are extravagant) so my partner being a high earner isn't really important, buuuut also love alone isn't enough to sustain a relationship. I would feel crippled and useless if i were with someone just because they gave me money/shelter but I'd also feel unfulfilled if i were with a cheerleader/yes-man type. Reductive questions like this don't really reflect real life and only act as fuel for people's biases, making them essentially useless"
Throw him out like yesterday's garbage and get you a real man oooh yeah!
"I would not react with enthusiasm. We have been married since 1990, and while I have a tattoo of an icon representing our son's name on my arm, I would not want to write out actual names on my body. I *might* consider a heart with a pair of wedding rings entwined, and our wedding date."
"I still don‚Äôt have a backbone but I‚Äôve worked really hard on healthy boundaries and I‚Äôm getting there slowly. Most of it is my culture, im Persian, I‚Äôm also exactly like my mom who is the kindest person in the world but is also too kind and forgiving. She taught me to be the way I am and now says she regrets it because I let people walk all over me with a smile on my face."
I went to summer camp where they filmed the movie. It was dope
"I 24F grew up in a midwestern Catholic family. Still developing it. Yes, it‚Äôs awkward. And hard."
Brooklyn Nine Nine! A really fun and wholesome show that makes me laugh but also happy cry quite a bit.
Is this a reference to what the characters tried to change Crystal Lake to in part VI? In which case it was actually Lake Forest Green. If not ignore me
"I‚Äôm only 17 so I‚Äôm torn between I‚Äôm too young or I‚Äôm really a romantic, so I guess only time will tell. But I see all my friends getting crushes, and falling in ‚Äòlove‚Äô getting boyfriends, and it‚Äôs just not happening to me and that‚Äôs frustrating"

Sending hugs your way
"A really small family wedding (the bride was already 6 months pregnant by then and they basically only married to make everything ""proper"") with a huge party band. We were like 30 people and it was the sort of band that plays beer tent festivals (think Oktoberfest). Just didn't fit the vibe at all."
My queen of blades (SC) action figure.
No thank you to both of those.
I would ask him why he wants to doom our relationship
"When I was 8 or 9, my mom took me to the wedding of one of her employees. She was moving with her husband so she had already given notice, but they were still friends and all. It's a small business, so she's close to everyone who works there.

It was the second wedding I ever went to, but the first was when I was 2 or 3 so I didn't remember it. They called all the single women to catch the bouquet. Some people looked really excited so I figured I should let them go for it. I stood off to the side so it wouldn't come to me. Turns out the bride didn't have great aim. The bouquet came right to me. A bridesmaid related to the bride was **PISSED.** This is a full grown adult woman, maybe late 20's early 30's. She see's the bouquet is coming towards me, so she jumps in front of me and shoves me over. I stumble, but I still end up catching it. She gives me a dirty look, and then **elbows me in the ribs.** I was a child and she assaulted me for catching the bouquet, that I didn't even want to catch. With her attitude there is no amount of luck or magic in the world that would make someone want to marry her.

She had a bunch of people on her side that all gave me the dirtiest looks the whole rest of the day. One older lady (Either the mom our aunt of the bridesmaid) even came up to me and angrily said something like, ""you know can't keep that! You have to give it back!"" Turns out she wanted to whine at the bride to give the bouquet to the bridesmaid. The bride was having none of it, and told me to keep it. (They were fake flowers, not like they would die) So I did. Had the bridesmaid or aunt asked for it, I would gladly given it to them. But I wasn't about to reward their assault and bullying. I still have it 15/16 years later."
"Thank you for your ""permission"". GIL is not going to get better so we're going to get some resources to help all of us. For now, I'm watching bad episodes of Star Trek Voyager in the dark with my vape so I'm okay. Thank you for your comments."

There is a large part of Upstate NY that thinks it's the south. I lived in one of those areas for a while. Jfc.
"I'm honestly really terrible at giving compliments to anyone. I am trying to be better and I've offered a few compliments to my male relatives and friends over the past few months. They seem to be well-received.

I won't be complimenting a stranger anytime soon though. Tried that one time recently, ended up having a guy follow me through a store and out to my car. I hate that men, in general, receive so few compliments but I'm not interested in being followed again."
"Because boys get socialized to take their problems out on other people, and that violence is an acceptable reaction to a societal setback."
"There‚Äôs only been one in my country as far as I can recall, and that was a deranged person reacting against complaints made against him. In America, guns are much more widely available, and a lot of people seem emotionally repressed then explode violently. Sorry for the generalisation."
Did it take more than one session to remove the hair?  Was it costly or is the end result worth the price?
I grew up pretty middle class and still all my clothes came from Salvation Army and Goodwill. Anyone who thinks that's gross is a snob!
Have you ever asked her ‚ÄúQuick! What DOOO the scriptures say? Citations too!‚Äù
"I tend to know quite quickly. Guys usually aren't half as slick as they think they are, lol.

Taking an apparent interest in you, staring at you when they have no reason to, smiling a lot, finding excuses to be near you, shifting to conversation towards you a lot/including you into the conversation, compliments, the works."
"My best friend in high school became friends with my boyfriend, with my consent. It was cool, we'd all chat and laugh and have fun. Until I was spending the night, went to take a shower, and came back into her room for her to make eye contact with me and said ""I love you too, (insert bf name)"" 

So safe to say I gave him his class ring back and our friendship was sufficiently over. Turns out they were fucking for a month or so. 

Her bf, who she was cheating on with my bf, started texting me. We became friends. After a while we decided we liked each other and started dating. He came to visit my dad with me for Christmas after about 6 mo together. While we were there I found texts of her trying to get him to come over to see her and him just saying ""I can't right now, I'm busy, i miss you too""

I was young and dumb so I told him me or her. And he chose me, so he told her he isnt interested, deleted all the texts, and blocked her number. 

I go back to school and my class has ""connections"" which is where we talk about what's going on in our lives to keep us close and motivated or whatever.  And she's going on about how she had a shitty break because her ex wasn't talking to her anymore and screw the ""girl code"" she didnt care because she was happy. Everyone jaw in that room dropped. She didn't have many friends left after that.

I left out a lot of details because I was young and REALLY dumb and went along with a lot of shit for entertainment purposes. And I could write a book on just that ex boyfriend and ex bestfriend alone so I'm sorry if it's confusing!"
Still trying to achieve this lol.
Holy fuck
"2019.

I've lost 40lbs and I've became more healthy. Also I've stopped being toxic and I think my depression is gone 
I can say that I'm pretty happy"
I think we have a winner.
When he finds a reason to touch you. Like when he walks by you and 'accidentally' brushes your hand with his and stuff like that. Only cute when you like him back though.

"A woman I knew was getting married for the second time to a guy she had known for less than a year.

They cut corners literally wherever they could on the wedding.  I am pro-frugal, but there's frugal and then there's cheap.  They sent out invites via facebook, the wedding took place on an outdoor non-air conditioned bar patio in the middle of the summer in the south, the decor was all cheap plastic stuff that the bride immediately tried to sell to her friends and family on fb after the ceremony, they did not provide food and told guests to purchase their own food and drinks from the bar, and dessert was a couple trays of cookies from the grocery store with price tags still stuck on.  The groom sweat so much that his white shirt was transparent. The bridesmaid had underboob sweat seeping through her satin dress.  There were not enough chairs for all the attendees and many people had to stand.

The couple left directly after the wedding to get matching husband and wife tattoos. In less than a month (probably closer to a week), they had broken up, the bride had scheduled a tattoo cover up appointment, and she proceeded to post about their messy divorce all over facebook for the next year or so."
‚ÄúEverything is gonna be okay‚Äù
"Lol! My wedding was last year in the hottest weather York had that summer. Fortunately my bridesmaids wore cotton dresses and jumped into the creek immediately after the 10 minute ceremony. Some of the groomsmen followed suit by dressing down to the skivvies and swimming, as did the kids. Not even mad."
"I was asked to be an usher at my guitar teachers wedding when I was 13. It was at the music camp she taught us at every summer. There were 4 other girls around my age there for the same reason, although I'm pretty sure one was significantly younger than us. It wasn't a huge wedding, but there was probably around 60 guests. 

Some how we ended up doing EVERYTHING, it felt like we were running the entire wedding. It started with some off handed requests from the bride to do little things here and there until we slowly learned it was OUR job to seat everyone, make the beds for all the guests in the cabin, clean up the ceremony area and reception area, serve the food, do the dishes and handle any special guest requests. We were so young and she was our teacher I don't think any of us felt comfortable telling her no or asking why no staff was hired to actually handle this stuff.

Once we fininished collecting all the chairs from down where the ceremony was, we walked back up to the camp and realized all the adults were GONE. Later we learned they all drove 2 miles away to a camp fire to party and drink. We were so exhausted, stuck at the camp completely alone with no cell service until around 2 in the morning wondering where everyone went. Finally we worked up the courage to walk down to the main road where we found a bit of cell service. My mom drove an hour and a half to pick us up, she was so upset about how they treated us. 

The weirdest part was later we got a note in the mail on an crumply paper bag kind of cut up to make a card, and it just said ""Thanks so much for your help! -bride"" So bizzare. 

We did an amazing job though, now that I think back it's pretty crazy that the wedding was essentially run by 5 teenages girls and went off without a hitch!"
This was what I came to say haha :D Great minds think alike
"I was 13 and found out that my cousin that I used to spend summers hanging out with is getting married. She was 15 and pregnant from her 19-year-old boyfriend. Mind you, a couple of months before finding out about the marriage we were chilling like a regular couple of kids, building a treehouse and etc.   


I don't remember much about the wedding itself, just the utter disgust I felt seeing them make out in front of everybody. I was so sick in fact, that I had to leave early. They divorced after 2 years because he got another 15-year-old pregnant."
"The best way to assess attraction or any other emotion is to compare the person‚Äôs behavior to their baseline with others that you know they aren‚Äôt attracted to (like, if it‚Äôs a straight guy, other men). Some people are just very open and friendly to everyone, so if they are open and friendly with *you*, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they are interested romantically (I have this problem).

I‚Äôd say effort is a good indicator. If someone frequently texts you or initiates conversations with you, finds reasons to be in the same places or rooms as you, and makes excuses to see you, that means they‚Äôre probably thinking about you a lot. I‚Äôd say *most people* would not behave this way with someone of the preferred sex that they know they aren‚Äôt interested in, but again, it helps to compare their behavior with you to how they generally are with others."
"   Okay get ready ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî 
My friend of 5 years decided to meet up with a kid that me and literally every single one of her other friends that knew him and including people that I know that knew him that he was bad news. We all gave her 100% true reasons as to why she shouldn‚Äôt affiliate with him and she ended up dating him after knowing him for two weeks. The guy she‚Äôs dating has done countless things without any repercussions on his part. Here‚Äôs some of the things he has done - 
tried to break me and my boyfriend up 3 times to get me to date him, lied about me cheating on my boyfriend with him, lied about me dating him, and said I sent him things I never sent , kissed someone without consent, kissed my friend and then looked at her and said I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm in love with ( My name here ), created countless rumors about me and my closest friends ( that used to be nice to him till he spread rumors about me ).And she believes his made up rumors. Even the ones about me .
And she doesn‚Äôt bElIvE he‚Äôs done any of that even though literally everybody that knows him told her about it...  Keep in mind she‚Äôs known him for MAYBE a month and me and her have known each other for years, and I‚Äôve known the kid she‚Äôs dating for 1 year - I met him before she met him - 

She doesn‚Äôt talk to me anymore because he told her not to hang out with me because he thinks I‚Äôm going to make them break up and I‚Äôm going to date her- which makes no sense because I‚Äôm more than happy with my boyfriend right now, and he knows I wouldn‚Äôt date her( breaking them up as in I told her everything he has done to people to show he‚Äôs a bad person and to just steer clear of him ). Even  if I want to talk to her he follows no matter what and will never leave me alone and he knows he‚Äôs being an asshole about it too. Like he will purposely distract her till I give up on talking because she‚Äôs not listening. But I‚Äôm the bad guy. And so is everybody else for warning her that this kid is not okay and is very bad news. She also told him a BUNCH of super personal shit about me that I‚Äôve trusted her with...Oh and I talked to him the other day because he said it was stressing her out and he wanted to cut the crap so he said that - I hurt him because I never dated him - like I‚Äôm sorry but that doesn‚Äôt give you a right to be an asshole and spread fake shit about me and try to kill MY relationship I‚Äôve done nothing. Literally nothing. 
Thanks."
"Yea, I'm definitely not part of that other half, but I'm glad to not be if that is how family events go"
My cousin's wedding had the most strange/horrible reception lunch ever. We were in this restaurant in the countryside. It was july so the tables were in the open. But... the kitchens and the tables were separated by a stare highway: the poor waiters had to cross the street everytime.

Rain on your wedding day is supposed to be good luck actually
"I think a big thing for me is consistency. If there isn‚Äôt or the other person doesn‚Äôt seem to be trying to keep the friendship alive, then I forget about them pretty quick now. Like, just stop caring."

"My baby sisters‚Äô wedding. My poor parents did everything themselves. Made/set out the decorations, made/plated the reception food, had to move all the furniture the venue normally has in the reception area (the venue employees were supposed to do that), and at the last minute my dad had to figure out how to wire a haphazard sound system. My sister picked out a small local winery which was nice, except it was early September in southern Missouri and hot as balls! The old, curmudgeon of a winery owner refused to help or turn on the A/C in the reception building. At the last minute he changed where guests could park so the wedding party had to go out and direct traffic differently. My sister wrote out her nice vows but her wing nut of a husband decided to just go off the cuff and rambled on about weird shit that had nothing to do with my sister. It got so hot in the reception area after everyone went in to eat that the cake melted in on itself when we tried to cut it. After all that I got totally shit house drunk off of the pre-purchased, locally made wine and acted like a fucking jerk off. My sister picked Labor Day weekend as the date so at least there weren‚Äôt as many guests as there could have been. It was terrible. Their divorce was finalized a few months ago."
"Probably Reddit‚Äôs attitude towards fat people, especially fat women. CICO is real, but there are a lot of complicated reasons why some people take in more energy than they can expend."
"I have ghosted and been the ghoster.    I think we blame the ghoster too often.   If it‚Äôs not something we did it‚Äôs not personal,   Or is something to do with them.  If it is then it‚Äôs our behaviour that caused it.    The times it‚Äôs uncomfortable are times I haven‚Äôt been on top form or as compassionate as I feel I should have been.    Sometimes it‚Äôs fair sometimes it‚Äôs not  but regardless of fairness I can sometimes see how my behaviour will have lead to someone ghosting me.   For example, an ‚Äòunfair‚Äô example might be when I reasserted some healthy boundaries that didn‚Äôt suit the person.  Fair examples include not being able to cope while I was at the height of PTSD and needing to set their own boundaries.  Ghosting is easy to complain about but lots of times people I know complain about it I can see why it‚Äôs happened.   

Its a type of consent issue o think; we aren‚Äôt actually owed anything usually."

"It's hard when you want to be a kind person. Usually if all parties are mature adults, things can stay as a friendship and it'll be ok. For unrequited crushes directed at me, I admit I vacillate between friendly and ice queen/no contact (not proud of this), because I've found that some people don't read cues. Like if I'm always turning down your invites, then... maybe pick up what I'm putting down?? I mostly had to have 'the talk' when I was younger. But recently had an older man keep pressing things and it was annoying. 

However, I have had plenty of my own unrequited crushes, so I don't want to be cruel. But if people don't get it and persist, it's not your fault if you need to lay down the law at some point!"

"Similar situation with my girlfriend except the guy was girl As boyfriend and girl B (who was my gf best friend but also girl As bf) who also told us that he'd been very inappropriate with her (but not quite assault) told my girlfriend she believed her and would back her up. 
Then when my gf told girl A what her bf did girl b then refused to back her up and tell girl A what her boyfriend had done to her as well.

My girlfriend basically lost all her friends and trust in other people. 1 and a half years later and she's still having trouble making new friends because she doesn't think she can trust anyone to not eventually hurt her again.

P. S. I'm at a party with girl A who I haven't seen since that incident a year and half ago. I've just been ignoring her. Thankfully my girlfriend is out of town and didn't have to decide whether to come to a party where she'd be."

"I grew up with a bunch of brothers and went into a male dominated field. Yes, I have a bunch of guys that are just friends. They see me a friend too. It is okay not to be sexually attracted to someone and be a friend. 

There was a guy that I dated at the start of college, we ended up realising we are much better as friends and he became part of my college circle of friends. When he introduced me to his girlfriends (over several years, he‚Äôs not a cheater), some of them got super weird - ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt be friends with the opposite sex, you can‚Äôt be friends with an ex‚Äù. Thankfully, other girlfriends became friends (I managed to pick up a super tight buddy through this connection).

PS - I have plenty of female friends too."
Asking the real questions
"Ugh, this brought up some feelings for me. When I was a teen, I was being groomed (unknowingly at the time but it‚Äôs obvious now) by my boss at work. When I realized it, I told a friend/coworker who said that she owed too much to him to let it affect her relationship with him. Years later, he was arrested for sexual harassment of a minor (plus other things) and she posts it on Facebook going ‚Äúoh, I knew this guy.‚Äù In a moment of rare online vulnerability for me, I shared my story about him. After I did, she claimed that she suddenly remembered that she, too, was harassed by him. I never said anything online or to her but I know she‚Äôs lying, for a wide range of reasons that I won‚Äôt go into here. It‚Äôs heartbreaking. Like, it hurts my heart to think about."
"Not I!  Most feet are ugly, especially men‚Äôs feet. Not that I really care one way or the other, but I can‚Äôt see getting a fetish about a foot."
"I was in an abusive relationship. I reached out to a couple of his exes bc he was still messaging all of them through social media. I asked all of them if he was always like this. Every. Single. One of them said yes BUT he's such a great guy and I'd be the bad guy for reporting him to the cops bc I'll upset his mom. 

(This is why the metoo movement will never ever work.)"
"&gt;never chips

Trust me, it can.  I open cardboard boxes all day at work, so chipping is unavoidable no matter what.  The problem with gel for me is that, even if it does hold up better than nail polish, it also damages my nails a lot more when it *does* chip or start to peel up."

That's awful! Did he sleep with her? That makes me sick to my stomach because I had a friend who tried to do that.
Is the feeling of dread stronger when you don't reciprocate?
"He‚Äôll try to prolong conversation even when it gets a bit dull because he doesn‚Äôt want to stop talking to you. My younger self with lower self confidence saw this as the guy having no social awareness and not realizing that he should let the conversation die. Looking back now, some of those guys definitely liked me. Combined with how eager they were to talk to me, how often they wanted to hang out, and friendly demeanor, that is."
"And that was what exactly happened. She never respected my privacy, and always overheard the conversations I had with my mom. It became so bad, I had to go into my bathroom whenever I had to skype with my parents."

"My first wedding. We were on a budget. Of basically nothing. Dress: $25 bargain rack, my aunt did the flowers. The church and minister were hired from The Nickel classified paper who advertised ""Cheap Weddings!"" Our reception was held in the tiny house we lived in at the time, and there were three Subway Footlong sandwiches cut into appetizer sized portions and held tohether with toothpicks, and to drink, a keg of not premium beer. So a lot of beer on almost empty stomachs, combined with how small the reception area was made for some almost unforgettable events, (but we drank a lot so we did forget much of what transpired) events that one might describe as trashy, and at the very least, lacking class. Which are not the words you want to be used when describing your wedding. In conclusion, we (bride and groom) were sent off to our (in-town) honeymoon (room at a moderately priced but not special in any way hotel) to enjoy our first night as man and wife. Unfortunately, we never could remember who passed out first. We could only conclude that no hanky panky happened, as we fell asleep upon arriving and awoke to the staff telling us it was checkout time, hungover and laughing about how hopefully things could only get better from there. In regards to the marriage itself, they did not."
I would have thought that if you haven‚Äôt got a complete uterus the pregnancy wouldn‚Äôt be viable or you certainly wouldn‚Äôt be able to carry it to term. A relative of mine has an abnormally shaped uterus and can‚Äôt sustain a pregnancy for that reason - there literally isn‚Äôt enough room for a foetus to grow.

"Went to a wedding for a college friend. The bride was 21 groom was 43 on his 3rd marriage. Marriage lasted less than a year.  My sister was in the wedding but neither of us were even close with the bride. My sister worked on a group project with her in class and all the group members were asked to be bridesmaids. Brides parents did not approve so brides only family members attending the wedding was a cousin and sister. Groom had a few buddys there but no family. The hall was decorated imacuately and tablesettings for at least 100 people. Our entire class was invited to the wedding and I guess a lot of people RSVPd but nobody really knew this girl so only 4 guests showed up, plus myself, my mom and the parents and boyfriends of the bridesmaids. My sister, bridesmaids and I feel horrible for the bride who spent all this money on food, dj, catering, open bar, and gifts for guests to have nobody show up. We end up calling some friends and family to explain you need to crash this wedding and party with us tonight because this wedding is a bust and hey, free meal and open bar. So a bunch of our friends show up last minute and crash the wedding. The bride doesn't even really know half the people she invited so she doesn't notice she knows nobody at her own wedding. The location of the wedding was also on a street where sex workers frequent and is attached to a budget motel that is known to rent rooms out by the hour etc. My buddy shows up and ends up asking a bunch of hookers to come to the wedding and party with us.  The groom and bride ended the night by having threesome with one of them."
You‚Äôre welcome. Take care and I hope you have a lovely weekend
Just found out about her. God damn
"Yes, I love it! I wouldn't want to be married to anyone else."
"It was a dry wedding (first problem) and there was no dance (second problem). This gave the wedding party the impression that everyone could give a speech, and they could talk as long as the wanted. We sat through 3 hours of speeches (which they did before serving the main course). The absolute worst part of the speeches was the father of the bride actually talked about how proud he was of his daughter‚Äôs purity."
You should definitely ask this question under the birth control reddit page i keep getting all my posts about birth control deleted on this page.
"My mother's second marriage. I was a teenager (as were my siblings and my new stepsiblings--five of us total). My stepfather and mother were both widowed. My stepfather decided that they should get married at the beach town where he, his kids, and his wife had vacationed every year--which of course went over great with his kids, who saw reminders of their mother everywhere. He also decided they should get married on a boat, even though my mother got seasick easily. Then it turns out that we are right on the border between two states, and the justice of the peace conducting the ceremony was insistent that we had to be in the right state's waters before he could marry them. So the boat kept going in circles as the captain and his teenage son (who one of my stepsisters kept trying to hit on in an extremely awkward way) looked at a map (this was about 20 years ago) trying to figure out exactly where they were. Everything was tense, everyone was nauseated. 

The marriage did not last long."
