"My most painful breakup was breaking up with an ex who I genuinely loved, and was a great person, but knew it wouldn't work long term. We both had very different goals for our future and there wasn't going to be a compromise (I want kids, he doesn't, he wants to live in the country, I prefer the city or suburbs at least, and just a bunch of other things). He is a great person, just not the person for me. I had to end it and move on instead of dragging out a doomed relationship. Luckily, we've both found happiness now with people who are more suited to us."
"Two thoughts here:

Staying positive: as a personal goal is great. 

""Stay positive"": as a phrase said to someone else is NOT great. It's generally advisable not to tell someone how *you* think *they* should feel."
For me I have found that sloth is the enemy. Staying occupied (physically and mentally) has been a lifesaver.
"Remind myself that attractiveness is subjective. I think my best friend has a face like a Victoria secret model but I know people who think it‚Äôs ‚Äúman-ish,‚Äù I know a girl who thinks she‚Äôs fat and guys who think that her body is insane. At the end of the day, just present yourself exactly as you want and the right people will find/take notice of you. No one else matters."
"I thought I didn‚Äôt love the guy. I thought I settled. My ex came back into my life and made me feel like the world was at my feet. About 3 months after the breakup, i realized I made the biggest mistake of my life. 

I tried to distance myself from everyone and everything and just try to get my thoughts together. Maybe I just needed space? 

Meanwhile the guy I broke up with wrote me letters and sent them to my home. My sister collected the mail and left those letters out because she thought I didn‚Äôt need added stress (she didn‚Äôt know I was regretting the breakup). 

It‚Äôs been a little over a year, and I reached out to him to maybe talk again? I‚Äôm not sure what I was expecting. But I found out he gets married in two weeks. 

I wish him nothing but the best. I want him to be happy and I want him to live a life full of love, laughter and joy. All things I couldn‚Äôt give to him because I chose to follow lust."
"Pockets is an obvious one. The other one is wildly inconsistent sizing! S/M/L, 8,10,12 they are all completely meaningless. One stores 12 is another stores 8. Then you get not only fluctuations within a store but also within the same type of clothing item and sometimes between colours of the same item ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüò©üòñ. Idk why the can‚Äôt be sized according to actual measurements!"
"Weird, came here to say this exact thing. Except the ending is different. I saw him last weekend at a wedding,  relaized I missed  him, got drunk and told him and then proceeded to throw up in his truck because I lost track of how much I had been drinking. 

So...
Yep."
Look at favorite pictures of me. Telling myself I‚Äôm still that same person.
"After apologizing a million times, I offered to pay for his truck to get detailed. He denied it and said he'll take care of it then made a joke about how that's what happens when white girls drink at Indian weddings. Then I offered to take him for lunch in a week. Soooo, we'll see. It's all confusing but seeing him again after a long time definitely threw me off my game lol."
"I'm not a fan. Sometimes things suck, and downplaying, ignoring, or repressing negative emotions and experiences doesn't stop them from existing and is far more damaging than acknowledging them and dealing with them.

I think that maintaining an optimistic outlook can be beneficial, but that the general idea of ""staying positive"" is not particularly helpful. Whenever I feel bad and someone tells me to stay positive or ""look on the bright side"" it feels like they're telling me to act happier because my sadness, unhappiness, or other negative feelings make them uncomfortable. It feels like a disingenuous and ultimately selfish attempt to make me feel better so they don't have to ""deal with"" my feelings. It comes across as a prioritization of their immediate comfort over my long term happiness and always makes me feel like I can't be open with that person.

TL;DR ""look on the bright side"" or ""stay positive"" feel like the emotional equivalent of ""you should smile more"""
I became a lot more confident when I stopped caring about being ugly/attractive.
"Loved him, were together for a very long time (over a year which is long for me) 

Started hanging out with a gay guy I met at a place I worked. He was insanely nice to me. Boyfriend said he got ""very awkward and uncomfortable"" vibes from him after he basically did a bunch of weird passive aggressive shit to my boyfriend and refused to meet him after inviting him over for dinner and a bunch of stuff. He asked me not to hang out with him but Gay friend convinced me he was a protective jealous homephobe, hung out with him, he ended up date raping me at a party in front of people.

The guilt and shame of not fucking listening to someone who I knew fucking loved me basically lead me to kick break up with him tell him to move out, and ghost him. 

After a saga of bad choices to cope and horrible depression I decided to get my life back on track and came out to him and he didn't even skip a beat he drove an hour to our apartment, comforted me for an entire night, is helping me with legal stuff, and we're back together and honestly the romance is stronger and the bedroom life is a lot more intense and passionate. 


So...happy ending"
"The vast difference in quality.  Mens' clothes have thicker, softer fabrics and their clothes are often much more durable.  Look at the difference between mens' socks and womens' socks, for example.  We deserve higher quality, more comfortable clothes."
"Once while in a grocery store line at midnight with all the usual ‚ÄúI hate everything‚Äù snacks a girl behind me said to her friend, ‚ÄúI only take selfies so on nights like I can look at them and tell myself you bad shawty, maybe not right now but shiiiiiiet, you bad.‚Äù 

They too had a ‚ÄúI hate everything‚Äù snack pile. I went home and looked at some damn selfies."
"I broke up with my boyfriend of 4 years because I was hurt our relationship wasn‚Äôt going anywhere.  I felt like I was maturing but he wasn‚Äôt (even though he was 3 years older).

I was completely in love with him and heartbroken.  We were separated for 10 months and I dated a couple of other guys in that time but no one ever made me as happy as he had.

One day I was feeling really low so I called him crying.  He‚Äôs the only person I wanted to talk to.  He drove 45 mins from his place to mine instantly to come see me, no questions asked.  He made me feel so much better just by being there.  We started dating again shortly after that.

It‚Äôs been 5 years since then. We‚Äôve now been married for 2 years and have a 1 year old son.

Part of me regrets breaking up with him and that we lost that 10 months together but I also think separating was what we both needed to see how much we meant to each other. We both grew as people during that time and now I couldn‚Äôt imagine my life without him."
"I look younger than I am, I'm soft-spoken, and I sound like a child, especially when I use my ""customer service voice."" For me, a lot of it comes down to *believing* I know what I'm talking about. People can smell uncertainty. I really have to put a lot of effort into speaking with authority and maintaining that feeling of authority even when challenged. When I get flustered, I get steamrolled."
"God I hate it when people interfere like that. I know they are only trying to look out for you, but situations like that have too many sides and angles, she couldn't have known what effect withholding those letters could mean.

It's like the notebook goddammit."
"Why are so many tops and dresses designed for bralessness or strapless bras? Backless, cut outs, tie backs, no straps, too low cut, why??? I have to wear a bra and will only do a strapless for special occasions because they suck. Is it that much work to design clothing with bras in mind? And if the answer is yes, can you make your tops/dresses searchable by ability to wear a bra? If I can search by backless, why can‚Äôt I search by ‚Äúhas a back?‚Äù Reformation is the only company I know of that says whether or not a dress or top is bra friendly, but even they don‚Äôt let you search by it."
"For me my depression is amplified if I'm left to drift into my own thoughts. Being bored and allowed to dwell on thoughts is **the worst thing ever**. 

&amp;#x200B;

Music, cleaning, walking my dogs, video games, crocheting. Something to keep my mind occupied is what sometimes works. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know you, or  your situation, but have you seen your doctor? 

Sometimes your depression and anxiety cannot be pulled out of. This was happening to me last year and I thought it was just normal. I started crying over everything, people made me anxious, not being able to control things that were obviously out of my control left me anxious beyond reason, traffic when I left work made me rage and cry, I started having morbid nightmares, my anxiety caused me to be hyper sensitive to sounds (I have 2 parrots... I wanted to kill them), my job in its entirety was an anxiety trigger, etc... I went to see my doctor and broke down in front of her and after an hour of bawling and talking, she had no doubt I was depressed and prescribed me medication. 

&amp;#x200B;

It took about 2 weeks of being on the medication and then all of a sudden I realized I had more bounce to my step, my drives home were a breeze (despite there being grid lock at times), I barely reacted to loud noises, I found myself getting over the uncontrollable things significantly easier, I didn't cry when I dropped something, my anger subsided and I didn't have nightmares. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure you know this, but depression is no joke. My mum has been on her medication for 15 years and she will never go off of it. Looking back, I know I've been depressed for well over 10 years, but thought it was just my personality. 

&amp;#x200B;

You are most definitely *not* alone with this m'dear."
"I was just complaining about sizing to my guy friends. I'm usually a medium, but when it comes to numerical sizing I'm a 6 at Express, 8 at American Eagle, and a freakin 12 at H&amp;M. And that's just in jeans! Whenever I order pants I usually have to order 3 pairs of the same size because they'll all fit differently. The fashion world just needs to get over the taboo of actual measurements in inches and start labeling clothing according to that, similar to men's.

&amp;#x200B;

I also despise how so many women's tops are borderline see-through and thin. I can't wear any of my cute dark-colored or print bras because I need to wear a nude one underneath any light-colored shirts."
"I find it really unnerving actually. A lot of people I know who try to live this ""positive vibes only"" lifestyle are just... odd. It feels really fake and forced, and it's not healthy to just repeat it to yourself like a mantra while ignoring all sorts of reasonable negative emotions. I don't understand why it's a movement. It feels sort of cultish at times."
Almost all American clothing is a result of child and slave labor that we have no information on. I hate it. I would end it.
"Dated my ex for about a year and a half, he told me he ""wasn't sure"" if he loved me anymore but wanted to stay together. I said no way and broke up with him. Both of us regretted it hard, 3 months later we got back together and were together for 11 years. Now we're in the middle of a divorce."
"Lol I'm a woman with male housemates. I'm always the one cleaning, and when I critique them for not pulling their weight, or when they come home and I'm in full house cleaning mode, they always ask what's wrong. Why am I stress cleaning? Bad mood?... Nope. It's way simpler than you think. I'm not cleaning cuz I'm mad at you. I'm cleaning cuz it's dirty. I'm mad at you now cuz you aren't helping"
Drowning sharks do do do do dooo
"This might not be super like, kosher but....  


I think about the things I like about people in my life, both close friends and more casual folks. The positives I think of are almost never related to their appearance, and it helps remind me that most people probably aren't thinking much about how I look either."
Communication. That's the biggest thing.
"NAGGING - men love complaining about this. They are mystified at why we nag, and are all 'wow why does my gf/wife nag so much, this is life's ultimate secret'. 

We don't like nagging, we only do it because men simply do not do what they say they will. Just fricking do what you say you will."
"Same here! I think of sharks ‚Äì how if they stop swimming, they drown and die. [At least I think that‚Äôs a true fact.] I HAVE to stay busy or else I sit there and wallow in my own self pity and feel even worse."
"I'm an incredibly positive person.

The past couple years taught me not to be like ""always smile, always stay positive, never show negative emotion"", but instead to embrace all those negative moments, dive deep into them, listen to my heart and feel all the emotions rushing through my body. To listen to appropriate music usually, to observe my feelings and learn from them (""Why did something happen? Is it actually bad? What could be done differently next time?"" etc) and to make fun of myself as frequently as necessary. I feel like humour and music are giving me unlimited energy recently. Mayhaps it was also important to acknowledge that I got precisely 0 power over anybody else ever, while realising that I got infinite power over my own self."
"I want to preface this with that I have been married for 11 years and this relationship took place when I was in highschool back in 2003.

I had dated a boy who was super quiet, shy and very doting. I loved him with all my heart and he was a terrible kisser, but I didn't care. He was dorky, sweet and loved to hold my hand. My girl friends made fun of me for dating him for all the reasons I loved him and so under so much peer pressure, I dumped him for being ""too clingy"".

Two months later my (ex) best friend decided she wanted to date him so they did and she suddenly dumped him after he spent the weekend at her house. Although I was very hurt she dated him despite me telling her I didnt want her to, she convinced me to remain friends. She claimed he tried to rape her. Considering I dated him for 10 months and he never once even tried to do something like that with me I was skeptical. 

She continued her trash talking him so badly that he almost was charged (she backed out when she couldn't give a straight story) and he moved to the city 2 hours away to live with his aunt and uncle because school became too hostile and he did his courses via independent learning. Behind (ex) best friends back me and him kept in touch but barely but we have mutual friends and I see him occasionally. Fast forward three years and we are a week from graduation. I see him at school and we make plans to go on a date the next evening and are hoping to rekindle things over the summer since he's moved back to town. 

That night, I get a phone call from our mutual friend, they are crying and tells me that he got into a car accident and didn't make it. He was trying to pass cars on a road under construction, no seatbelt, hits the gravel side of the road and flips his Jeep. He died instantly. 

I still think about him. He had invited me to the event he was speeding to. I could have been with him, he always drove slower and safer with me in the Jeep. I miss him so much and I still wonder if I would have ended up with him. 

My husband knows all of this and is very sympathetic about it. Husband reminds me so much of him, maybe that's why I fell in love with him, I dunno.

But I still think of him, I still have the bracelet he gave me and every year on the anniversary of his accident and his birthday I think a little more of him. I regret breaking up with him, it opened him up to a toxic person who did nothing but try and ruin his life, in the end it sent him on a path that ended in his death."
"Therapy. (This is number 1 for me by a long shot)

Taking super small steps to get some wins in. Like if I‚Äôm feeling like a 2 in all areas of my life I can‚Äôt even imagine what feeling like a 10 would be like. But, I can usually imagine what a 3 would look like. So I‚Äôll do baby steps to try to get to a 3. For example when I‚Äôm in a depression hole, my house is a mess because I just don‚Äôt care about anything. So rather than aim at having a spotless clean house, I‚Äôll aim at washing the dishes. Not even drying and putting them away, just washing them one night. I can aim at putting them away the next night. I may have to set a 10 min timer and wash them in spurts, but I‚Äôll then feel better having that one thing done. Then I build on that to tackle other things."
"It annoys me how inconsistent sizes are across different shops, especially with trousers.

Also, buying maxi dresses and skirts as a girl under 5""4 is so difficult."
Matching underwear makes me feel powerful
"I expected my future spouse to be a man.

My spouse is not a man.  So she doesn't really hold up that expectation well."
"Emotions- no, I‚Äôm not on my period. Believe it or not, I am a living, breathing, human being and I too have feelings."
"Cleaning, in my experience. I know so many guys who can't just clean one thing, but every time there's ""project cleaning"", like cleaning out the fridge, it's a 3 hour event that they have to rope everyone in the house into.

But then that may just be me pulling a trend out of a handful of people."
Make shirts you can't see through. I want one layer comfort please.
"I hate hate hate the materials 90% of womens' clothing is made of right now. Everything seems to be that weird, thin polyester (I always associate with H&amp;M) and anything with natural fibers is so expensive."
"My bestfriend and family friend of 10 years became my boyfriend.
We traveled together to places like India and Nepal, we protested together, went surfing, we were the ideal couple. Coupla cute hippies.
I'm not really sure where it all went wrong, but our relationship felt in dispair somehow, I think it was because it was unequal, I was making sacrafices for him and he didn't reciprocate, and then I was frustrated. We became frustrated.
One night after a big night of drinking, he took it upon himself to have sex with me while I was passed out, this was 100% not okay with me and I didn't give a second thought as I packed up my things and left him the very next day.
Maybe we could have worked it out, maybe we could have gotten through it and found some sort of understanding, but for years I beat myself up that I had made the decision too hastily and that I had left my soul mate, and it was my fault that I had lost the person I loved most.

It took a long time to realize how much damage he had done, that it was rape, and that none of it was my fault. It took a long time to stop regretting leaving and wondering if things could have been different.
Sometimes I still wonder a little, but I am completely at peace with the decision I made to leave. I am now in a much better place with my soul mate (I have come to believe you can have more than one) and I have learnt to trust people, and trust myself.

My ex can go to hell for what he did. He says none of it is my fault, but he doesn't admit it's his."
"I get this a lot. My anger is treated as ""cute"", as though I'm a yappy little chihuahua. My worries and sadness are patronised as though I'm a crying toddler upset over a bruised knee. 

When someone shows me they think less of me because I'm short and baby-faced, I put what I think of as my ""strict schoolteacher"" persona on. Generally I'm relatively relaxed and mellow in my demeanour, but when I'm doing the schoolteacher act I stand straight, smile much less, speak with a louder and less emotive voice, and phrase things in a firmer way. So ""Do you think you can take this to the other room, please? Thanks, appreciate it"" becomes ""[Name], please take this to the other room"". 

Unfortunately this does get me called bossy and demanding and all sorts of other names, even though the exact same behaviour is perfectly accepted from men. But since I'm forced to choose between ""cute little woodland animal we can all patronise and not listen to or take seriously"" and ""actual human being who we think is bossy but reluctantly listen to"", I'll take the latter. And then not hang out with those people in my spare time."
Took it to the pawn shop to find out it was a counterfeit.
"Menstruation.  A normal biological process that happens to almost all women, but some men act like understanding it requires several advanced degrees.  Just read a book or hit up Wikipedia.  It‚Äôs not that complicated, and hopefully knowing the basics will stop at least a few men from claiming women are ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù because of this thing that happens most every month of our lives for 30-40 years."
"Amen to this. Also if we are groomed to only express positive emotions and thoughts in a social setting, people who are going thru hard times feel silenced and even more isolated. 

I went thru a really rough time a few years ago (I was sexually assaulted, my parents announced they were divorcing, and I lost my job due to reporting the sexual harassment...all in one month). I tried to open up to my closest friend about it. She had been there for other friends who went thru hard times, so I thought she would be a good person to talk to. I let her see 1% of the pain I was in, and she totally put up a wall and told me she ‚Äúcan‚Äôt have this kind of negativity in her life‚Äù and completely cut me out. I was stunned and my pain increased exponentially. 

If all we talk about are positive things, we‚Äôre not living authentically, because negative emotions are 100% a valuable part of the human experience. By ignoring those elements of life, we‚Äôre isolating ourselves, alienating potential support networks, and increasing the likelihood of suicide. I know that I had suicidal thoughts when it dawned on me that even my closest friends and family wouldn‚Äôt be there to support me when I‚Äôm going thru something so painful. Thankfully I had access to a professional therapist, but many people aren‚Äôt that privileged. We need to stop creating stigma around negative emotions the same way we‚Äôre trying to reduce the stigma around getting professional help for mental illness! 

Life isn‚Äôt all sunshine and rainbows and THAT‚ÄôS OK!"
It's difficult for me to buy clothes that fit because of my proportions. Most clothes aren't made for people with long tors
Staying single/childfree by choice
"We both have lives outside of ""us"", including hobbies, friends, and events we go to without the other person. I think it has helped us both have individual identities so we don't feel too constricted by the relationship. We aren't needy or co-dependant. It definitely takes trust and being secure with ourselves and one another to achieve this."
"As someone who is in same boat as above, I think that one of the biggest things was getting rid my social media account. Facebook and especially Instagram are toxic as fuck. 

I also learned to stop thinking comparatively or placing myself at a lower level than other attractive women. This involves a lot of talking to myself to become accustomed to letting go of my first inclination of ‚ÄúOh, I wish I looked like her‚Äù or ‚ÄúDamn, I look like a troll compared to her.‚Äù Instead I consciously use language of acknowledgement like ‚ÄúShe has a great bum.‚Äù And that is IT. Other women‚Äôs beauty doesn‚Äôt have to be this grotesquely depleting contest with them. 

Aside from that I invested a lot in focusing on my internal qualities. When I do something well I give myself appropriate credit and try my best to go through the world leaving some sort of positive impact. Focusing on these qualities are far more lasting and in my mind more important than how I look. And, mind you, I‚Äôm not an attractive woman by conventional standards at all ‚Äî there are certain aspects of the way that I look that affects my life. Like men don‚Äôt hit on me or don‚Äôt want to date me. I‚Äôm often disregarded. These things hurt and are related to my looks so it‚Äôs hard not to dwell on physical appearance. I totally get that. It takes a lot of reconfiguring habits of how you think about yourself to get some relief from this image-obsessed world."
"I think it would have to be the friendship(?)/ communication break up now that I am experiencing right now. It hurts a lot because in a sense, I felt like I found my person: we came from similar backgrounds, introverted, care for our friends, and in our own way, we always wanted to improve ourselves.

I ended up hurting this person one too many times, and conversations between us have become strained and short. I don't like dragging something out so immediately  I said something along the lines of  ""Are we done?"" 

Waited a couple of days. No response. They eventually told me via text that it was for the best and they thanked me for my time in their life and everything else. 

I can only move forward right now and hope they'll reach out to me one day. To reach out...I don't know. I would be disrespecting their wishes I think."
"There‚Äôs this quote from Bob the Drag Queen that really helps. 

""Find something about you that you like and focus on that. If I don‚Äôt like my face, if I don‚Äôt like my skin, if I don‚Äôt like my weight. I think to myself 'I have a nice teeth.' And it may just start with that one tooth. Look at that tooth. That‚Äôs a nice tooth, man. And then once you can accept that little thing about yourself, you can just accept you for who you are."""
"I'm so done hearing that women need pockets, when I simply want stores to sell complete clothes. Backless, cold shoulder, deep V cut, mis-matched lengths on front and back, weird holes in shirt... Anytime I try to shop now, it's a game where clothes are either *incredibly* basic and frumpy **or** incredibly sexy and attention grabbing."
"Ditto to keeping yourself occupied. Find a hobby, and develop your skills. Set small goals if a large one feels too much. 

Call your family or a friend, simply have some small conversations here and there can get you out of your head. 

Clean your room, cook a meal, take care of yourself!

Or a quick fix - go lay out in the sun for an hour. Basking in sunshine can do wonders for the mind and body."
Oh no! What was the outcome of you don't mind?
They need to stop using sweatshops and give their employees a fair wage
"My therapist tells me to do the opposite of what I ""want"" because it's usually not what I actually need. If you want to isolate, pack your schedule with social activities. If you want to lay down, go for a walk. It's so hard to do but it helps"
Wow that's what I call a roller-coaster
"It was a mistake, I regret it every day. 
It‚Äôs been almost 3 years. I did everything I can think of calling, texting, emails, letters, showing up to his apartment.  Make sure you are 100% certain,"
Crying. It's really important to cry. Also not keeping children in cages I thought we moved past this ages ago
"I'm not angry, I just have no energy to show emotion.  Just cause I'm not smiling doesn't mean I'm automatically angry and upset.  Telling me I'm angry will make me angry.  It's more I am comfortable enough to not put on a fake face and be relaxed around you."
Ahh the sweet smell of the uneven distribution of domestic labor.
I honestly take a shower. It doesnt wash away the ugly lol but it makes me feel clean and ready to interact with the outside world.
"I'm not particularly attractive, definitely not conventionally so, but I don't understand what that has to do with ""confidence"". I don't think my value as a person hinges on whether I fit whatever is the current cultural standard of beauty."
"Bf left for the military and at the time it seemed like every call we would get we would argue. I was also in school and struggling badly. Losing sleep from arguing all night, not being able to focus in school, etc. I eventually told bf I needed to focus more on school and i couldnt do it because we were arguing all the time and him being gone in the military was taking a toll on me. (selfish i know) but instantly i regretted it because I had been with him for about 6 years at that point. He kept calling repeatedly after i broke it off but i thought it was just to cuss at me or yell at me so i stopped answering his calls. Then a few weeks later I finally answered and apologized and told him i was stupid for doing it and I felt bad about it. Family day in the military was coming up so I bought him a few things, dressed up and we talked it over and got back together. We started working on the arguing and things got better. I stuck with him after that and now weve been together for 14 years, got married, had 2 kids, and I deeply regret leaving him in the first place."
"Honestly tho, dude is better off. She basically had an emotional affair with her ex."
"I get into this argument with men all the time. I'm always freezing in the winter and they laugh at me because, ""why girls all so cold? lol."" I have to point out every year that women's clothes are shoddy and so freaking thin. My jeans are practically see-through, whereas my husband's are thick and durable and actually, you know, protect against the fucking elements."
"Hoarding shiny things in there, like a raven."
"Yeah, I asked my husband to clean the bathroom one time, six hours later...he had everything uninstalled and was ""cleaning"" he took the glass doors off the bathtub e closure to deep clean the tracks, he took the faucets off the tub and sink, they were not leaking before this but after this day we could never get them to stop leaking. He removed the toilet seat, and he scrubbed the mirror with comet cleanser. The floor was soaked he had a huge pile of wet towels, meanwhile I had cleaned the entire rest of the four bedroom three bath huge kitchen house. I let him do it, I didn't stop him. I had tried but he got mad and wanted to do I his way. 

He broke Six vacuum cleaners during our 8 years together. Left a chainsaw out in the rain, oh my God, he was something else. He made a lot of money and was really good to me otherwise,but OMG he was something else."
"Not married yet, but will be very soon!

I initially never thought I'd get married because I was very shy and afraid of men. I also had (and still have) a fear of being pregnant (no babies for this girl!).

When puberty hit, it was the mid/late 90s, and I was into buff guys with blonde spikey hair (paging Lance Bass). Then I hit my emo phase, and was obsessed with punk rock guys and skater boys I saw at Hot Topic. 

My high school sweet heart was a nerd, and ended up being a mega-abusive douche who cheated on me repeatedly. I thought I would marry him, but I finally wised up and moved on. I found myself falling for ""bad boys"" who had all the charisma but none of the emotional capacity.

Then I met HIM. He was chubby, bearded, and 10 years older than me with two kids. He's NOTHING like the guys I liked before. I didn't ""burn out"" with him through an infatuation phase like I had with every other guy I dated... we took our time, became good friends first. He was patient with me, unafraid to show emotion, very gentle, but very honest. A mega geek for anime, D&amp;D, and pro wrestling (none of which I had initially had any interest in). 

Best decision of my life."
"Honesty. 

Every man I've ever been with, even just casually outside of a relationship, has had an issue with honesty. Not just being honest, but  (seemingly) creating an idea in their head that they'll get a favored outcome from beating around the bush and giving positive answers to things they really want to give negative answers to. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example(s), my first ex boyfriend would lie about seeing other women (we were trying to be open) because he thought that telling me about them would make me mad or hurt my feelings. Another would feign interest in my interests, leading me to believe that he was excited about all my stuff, until one day he snapped and called me ""boring"". Then there was this dude I tried to hook up with that told me he was into really kinky stuff because he knew I was into kinky stuff, but then revealed in bed that he actually wasn't into much beyond vanilla sex. I have many more, but yeah...you get the picture. Maybe I have shitty taste in humans, or have too high of expectations, but there's literally no reason to not talk to your partner like a fucking adult."
"Vanity sizes make me mad! Yes it hurts to think you‚Äôre a bigger size than you are. But it‚Äôs so much better to wear something that fits rather than squeeze into something that doesn‚Äôt! All vanity sizes do is trick us into believing we‚Äôre a 6 say and then make us sad when in another store we couldn‚Äôt even get it past our knees! 

Also I get what you mean about light shirts but tbh I just wear my dark/funky bras üòÇ. Though I do sympathise because whilst I don‚Äôt care so much about bra lines/bra viability I have a real bug bear about panty lines ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôà"

"At least y'all can tell them? At 5'9"", I can't make fabric appear.and I'm not even *that* tall. 5'9"" is often the border between regular and tall size recommendations."

"Seriously. Been living with my now husband for 7 years and got together when we were 19. Never played any games or had any real arguments. We talk, we never go to bed upset at each-other, we never even really get to the point where we *are* upset at each-other. Communication is huuuuuge."
"Does this not work for anyone else. I always find flaws, either my eyebrows or chin or smile or nose. Seriously any picture of me I cannot find beautiful or pretty"
It absolutely can be but also I've found workaholic-y type people need to be careful with this. I don't know about everyone else but I've definitely taken this too far and come near making myself ill.
"I wash my hair, put some makeup on, put on a nice dress and then go wander past my husband until he looks up and goes 'wow you look nice'."
"Every women's shirt right now seems to be either a crop top or that awful, thin, see-through material. Why in God's name can't I just get a normal fucking shirt?!"
"I ended it with a guy I was madly in love with. We were in a weird semi-FWB semi-serious relationship in that we were both committment types who agreed to be in a relationship just until someone better came along for either of us. Yes, this was a very weird, very bad set up. We were young and stupid.

After almost a year of being together with no end in sight. I had fallen hard and knew that it was a lost cause so I screwed up my courage and ended things. It was the worst thing I had ever done and I regretted it hard for almost two years.

But I also focused on improving myself and my life. Slowly, things got better for me. Life without him got easier. I was doing everything everything right. I let myself regret ending things but also forgave myself for it.

One day, out of the blue, he came back. He'd been doing a lot of his own soul searching and growing. He hadn't been ready to give me what I needed back then but seeing me live my life without him made him realize that we were good together and that we wanted a lot of the same things moving forward.

We've been together a year now and are looking forward to spending the rest of our lives together. I play it over in my head every which way and have realized that if I hadn't ended things, we couldn't be as happy as we are right now. 

I had to let go to grow into a person who could make him happy and vice versa."
"I often find it invalidating, even if it's coming from a good place. Staying positive can be helpful, but being told to stay positive is not."
"Communication. Honesty. And I mean honest with yourself as well as SO.

"I was reminded yesterday of a sermon I heard back in my church days about shame. The preacher threw in ""and the commercials with the tampons?!? HAVE YOU NO SHAME??"" And I thought, well gee, if God gave us this process, why should we be ashamed to talk about how to handle it? Even now, years later, I want to poke him in the eye with a pencil."

"The desire to hide being sick or injured. My father in law died of a stroke because he didn‚Äôt know what was wrong, he ignored the fact that he felt completely awful and went to bed instead. If he had gone to the hospital instead of ignoring it, he would be alive today. 

My husband does the exact same thing. He never tells me when he‚Äôs sick or has a headache or an injury from work. He just hides it and tries to play it down if I notice something is wrong. It fucking terrifies me."
"Being happy with your appearance without changing it with makeup, bras, clothes tailored to make your curves bigger, stomach flatter and cleavage more visible or hairdo‚Äôs that give you a headache and heels that ruin your feet and back."

"Inconsistent sizing and lack of bras in my size. A size 14 in one place should be, if not the same, VERY similar to a size 14 in another shop. Oh... And the difference between a 12 and a 14 and a 14 and a 16 should be the same as well! I've seen 16s nearly twice the size of 14s and 12s barely smaller than 14s in the same shop!

As for bras... Cup sizes above D/E exist. Shockingly, they sometimes come with a relatively small strap circumference. Clothes makers seem to not be aware of this. If I want an F/F cup bra they often start at like 40/42 for the clasp... I need about 36/38. So I have the choice between handsewing the back (and often shoulder) straps shorter... Or having half my tits spill out. 12/10 thanks clothing industry."
"‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of you.‚Äù

"1) Money - What are their financial goals? Their philosophy with saving and spending? It‚Äôs one of the top reasons why people divorce, so this is a must.

2) Core Values - stance on religion, politics, etc. the fundamental values which makes a person who they are, and determines their views on many social issues. 

3) Children - do they want any? It is a major commitment that involves the aforementioned influencing how they‚Äôre raised, if you both are on the same page about having them 

4) Commitment- how does one define it? 

5) Communication and Conflict Resolution -What is your approach to solving problems? What are your love languages? 

The more questions asked, the better. :)"

"No. I had to move on and couldn't really do that if we were still talking. We did keep in contact and try to be friends for a time, but eventually I told him I had to go cold turkey because I wasn't moving on from the relationship. It depends on the people involved but I think it's really hard to move on from a relationship where the breakup was amicable/nobody was the bad guy and you still love each other if you're still talking regularly. I would certainly be friendly if I happened to run into him again. But we aren't friends."
If you dont mind me asking can you elaborate on why divorce?
I let him walk away bc I wasn‚Äôt able to be openly affectionate. He wanted a girlfriend he could kiss/cuddle in public and I couldn‚Äôt offer that.

1. Embrace change - allow and support one another to grow. Change it‚Äôs inevitable, but doesn‚Äôt mean that your love for one another can‚Äôt evolve/grow

2. Learn to communicate - read men are from mars and women are from Venus for a start. Men don‚Äôt talk as much as women but doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt get hurt or care just as much. Over-communicating did not help, we ended up yelling at one another at some pt... but after realizing how different men think, vice versa it‚Äôs so much easier now.

3. Money problems - I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a problem everywhere but when you get to my age. It‚Äôs just something that needs to be sorted out/agreed / discussed openly. Lol... not the biggest problem for me but it has been for others I know of.

4. Commitment - to be discussed and defined what that means for both of you. Be it as small as need to spend at least an hour a day together to long term commitments of having family etc.

5. Fun / why you fell in love with one another in the first place - and your own role to play in this. It‚Äôs not always about what the other person does. While eventually sparks become overrated, it will evolve into something else... just continue to care and love for one another and it will happen.

Just my two cents of thoughts - all the best!"
"I never expected to have such a wild and exciting life with someone who is as gorgeous, brilliant and love able as my SO. 

I moved to the other side of the world to be with her and I don‚Äôt regret it for a second. She‚Äôs the first person who gave me such an enormous amount of encouragement and hope, I never experienced that in previous relationships. With her I feel like we can accomplish anything and so far we have :)"
"Do something I enjoy and that makes me feel better. Get a facial, a massage, spend time with friends, go buy a new outfit. Exercise. All those things tend to improve my outlook."
"Plus sized clothes are hideous, and/or overpriced.

Feminism.
Life cannot be one continuous upswing. There are hard parts as well.
"You have no idea how many times I've heard men (and some women) say, ""I'm not a feminist, but I think women should have equal rights"". 

... that's what feminism is."
My rings were my grandmother‚Äôs rings. They have a ton of emotional value for me. They‚Äôre in the original box (from the 1940s) in my jewelry box.
"I need breathing room around my armpits. Short sleeves should be slightly longer and less tight. As it is, my armpits immediately break into a sweat the second I put a short-sleeve shirt on. But if I buy a larger size, it's too big everywhere else. 

Sometimes I just buy men's shirts because of this, but they never quite look right or have the right proportions. It's so incredibly frustrating."

"He was sweet and ambitious and my first love. He was caring and attentive but had a hard time communicating his feelings whereas I tend to be more vocal (saying I love you, I miss you, I‚Äôm happy we‚Äôre together, etc). It didn‚Äôt matter at first since we lived in the same city and saw each other often enough that every little action he did was a constant reminder of the way he felt for me (mostly small but attentive things which brightened up my entire day, which I often told him). However, we then began seeing each other less and less due to busy schedules and living somewhat far from each other (I went as in uni full time and working 2 jobs, he went to uni as well and worked 3 jobs). As we saw each other less, and he was never very vocal about how he felt, I began feeling insecure and soon broke it off after 2 years together. We had to do it over the phone because we couldn‚Äôt find a time to meet up. I loved him, he was ambitious, hardworking, attentive, and we shared many of the same values. I sometimes think it was a matter of just being together at the wrong time... I‚Äôm not sure if I regret it. I couldn‚Äôt fault him for working hard or for expressing his feelings in a way different from mine. I often think about him even though it‚Äôs been a year, but I wonder if that‚Äôs only because I haven‚Äôt dated anybody since."
"Never imagined I would be married or even have kids. I was a loner who liked to just chill. Swore I‚Äôd never get married. The men I imagined I would marry if I ever did were glasses and nerdy, as I am very nerdy. 

My husband exceeded my expectations. He is a nerd, anime loving, game playing, full time daddy. But he‚Äôs extremely handsome. The kind of guy who wouldn‚Äôt have paid attention to me in high school, or my image of a guy who wouldn‚Äôt give me the time of day. Was on varsity football, baseball, had a scholarship full ride. Goes to the gym 6 days a week. Literally appearance wise everything I‚Äôm not. But he‚Äôs a nerd. Major major nerd. Only did sports cause his parents made him, sweetest man I‚Äôve ever known. Looks are deceiving"
When I turn the A/C on in my (piece of crap) car it lets out this high pitched - burnt turtle squeal and it makes me laugh like a crazy person every time.
"I'm 28 and getting married in a few months.  My fiance and I began dating when we were 19.  Honestly I feel like our relationship worked well in the early years because we were willing to share and get involved in each other's interests.  I like hiking and being outdoors and my fiance got more into nature stuff because he knew how important that is to me.  Meanwhile he taught me how to play videogames so that we could play together and I could explore his hobbies with him. 

 Even now, whenever one of us wants to try something new we do it together.  For example he got into dungeons and dragons and now we play that together with friends.  I got into Marvel and now he's a bigger fan than me lol.  I know this seems silly but finding ways to enjoy new things together made it easier when our lives started going in different directions.  (We went to grad schools in different states, I got a job after 6 months but it took him over a year, family drama ect)."
"What women say.

"Totally agree. I am coming to realize that I am resilient as fuck, but that doesn't mean I'm relentlessly positive. It means I remember that this, too, shall pass. That I'm curious about the future, and I've decided to stick around and see what happens. I allow myself to fully feel whatever I feel, and I'm not so afraid of the dark times consuming me anymore."

"This. During a particularly bad time I read 'activity is the enemy of depression' and that was very powerful for me. At the time I was struggling to get out of bed when I didn't have to. I taped a note to my bedside table that says 'You're better than this - get up and get to retraining. You can do it! I promise'. It reminded me every morning that it wasn't me that was the problem, it was the piece of shit that is depression, I just had to break the habit. Every time I read it I sat bolt upright and said OI FUCK YOU BRAIN and got up. I am doing better now but I still keep the note there for the bad days."
"I'll bite!! How come male nipples typically aren't as sexually sensitive as female nipples? Every dude I've been with has allowed me to touch them but nobody ever really *liked* it. They just tolerated it and said it feels kinda meh. If I was gonna pull a percent out my butt I'd say 70% of women enjoy it and 70% of men don't enjoy it.

But why? Aren't our nipples all the same? Does the extra stuff in female boobs make them more sexually sensitive? Or could it be social conditioning to find certain things pleasurable?"
"Going without makeup/hair removal (as a female). 

&amp;#x200B;

It is so much healthier for your skin, mental health, and time management to forego these things. However, as a woman in her early 20s surrounded by beautiful girls in real life and on social media, these things no longer feel optional to me."
"I have a bad habit of being all or nothing with everything in my life, and when I'm in my deeper depressed funks, nothing is always the choice I make.

"We've been spoiled by fast fashion to expect cheap clothing so that when we find quality we just go ""oh, no, it's too much."" High quality don't come cheap, and then there's the added layer of basically needing a PhD in fashion and fabric design to distinguish good quality from overpriced fast fashion trying to pass itself off as good quality clothing. It's my quixotic journey to find pants that don't get holes in the thighs if I look at them wrong. 

I remember coming to the US in the mid nineties and most of my family's clothes being second hand cast-offs from a relative's super rich boss. I have two pairs of pants from that woman that I wore non-stop to my first office job, for YEARS. Washed them weekly. They are still black after ten years of nonstop use! 

I only stopped wearing them because they stopped fitting a few years ago. It's like freaking cotton Kevlar. I switched to Lane Bryant pants. They used to be a reach for my pocket, but they lasted. Now, good luck having it last twenty washes. 

But the price hasn't gone down. It's like wearing clothes made out of onion skin, but paying for fine Italian wool."

"I wanted very much to be with someone like myself- artistic, free-spirited, nature-loving, and extremely generous with their love. More than anything, however, I imagined myself being with someone who loved doing what I love- eating. Eating at restaurants, cooking together, campfire dinners overlooking some vast canyon. 

My husband is from a major city and grew up taking the bus every day. Prior to meeting me, he had never slept outside (although Survivor is his favorite TV show).  He is a sports fanatic. He would much rather watch tv than hike.  Worst of all of these offenses was that this man does NOT like food or eating at all really.  He once asked me if vegetables were important. 

These things did make me hesitate. But he did have the most important quality of all-  an extremely generous and passionate lover and companion.   Over the years he has even learned to eat more foods (a whole tomato the other day!) and sleep in a tent.  

I think the most important thing for couples with differences in interest is to recognize that your partner is never going to love the thing you love as much as you-  but if they love you enough to put up with it with a good attitude then be generous with your gratitude."
"Sex. Some men act as if female sexuality is this mystery only the initiated grasp, and getting you to orgasm either means they're Gods among men or is something that is beyond their or any man's capabilities and therefor should not be expected, at all. 

Dudes, get over yourself. Ask her what she likes, sexually, and do it until she orgasms. Be happy about said orgasm, but don't act like a smug sex God because you had the human decency to care about her pleasure as well."

And then masturbate.
"Talking about mental health, just casually. It's so important but makes a lot of people unfortunately uncomfortable in my experience. And not in like a serious depression and other issues discussion, just mentioning it in general and your head space."
"Yup. My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant. At the beginning of our journey, I had a couple miscarriages. Now we are 2 and a half years in with no other pregnancies and have been diagnosed with infertility since February of last year. I recently found out that I have the hormone levels of a woman twice my age.

Anyways, as some might imagine, it's been hard. All of the testing along with month after month of disappointment. Having to show up to my brothers wedding not even pregnant when I should have had a 2 month old. Having to watch his wife take the journey I was supposed to be having. Watching everyone in my life have babies and then ask me and my husband why we weren't. 

It's hard. It's so hard for me to be positive, but I try. I try not to let it all get me down so far that I can't get out of bed.

The problem isn't my pain. It's how other people deal with it when I open up to them. I am HURTING BADLY, but my mom constantly tells me that I need to have hope and faith and that the timing just isn't right. My grandma says that I need to stop dwelling on it.

Basically ""be positive."" And like the person your responded to said, that's not a bad way to try to live your own life. But every time someone SAYS that to me, it feels like I am not allowed to be sad. That my feelings don't matter and are an overreaction."
"I saw a woman at Ross crying because the four pairs of tall pants in her size fit her kinda like a kid that's growing out of an outfit, and her mom/friend/emotional support shorter person was squatting in the dressing room with a tape measure looking to see how much of the hem they could let out. I feel for you."

"I met this guy &amp; we fell in love - fast and it was intense. After 4 months he got a job in the city I lived in. I previously told him I didn‚Äôt want to live together before we were married. He got a job &amp; had to relocate &amp; start in two weeks so I let him move in. We were planning on getting married anyway. I just didn‚Äôt want to rush the courting. Again, I didn‚Äôt think he had money. He made a lot less than I did &amp; apartments are expensive here. I let him do it but a couple of months later I found out he had $50k in the bank. It wasn‚Äôt that I didn‚Äôt like living with him. I just thought it would be so much more romantic if we lived separately until we got married. When I told him this and my reasons, but that I still loved him with my whole heart he obviously didn‚Äôt believe me because he came home &amp; cried his eyes out. I took it all back because I never meant to hurt him. About a week or two later he said he was going to move out. I think it had weighed on him (the suggestion that he get his own place). Only, he started sleeping in the spare room all the while assuring me he didn‚Äôt want to break up. His words were not aligning with what he was saying &amp; I saw a shift in him &amp; felt like he was lying about moving out but staying together. I just had a gut feeling. It was like he emotionally shut off from me. I wasn‚Äôt able to sleep &amp; was emotionally a mess out of the confusion. I had sold expensive new furniture just so he didn‚Äôt have to sell his - so he could have a private den in the house. He sold that couch so I knew that it meant he wasn‚Äôt intending on staying. If he thought we were going to get back together why would he sell the couch? He didn‚Äôt even ask if I wanted it since i had sold my expensive furniture for him. Anyway, after he did that the next day I felt like I needed space to think &amp; sleep &amp; get some distance. I felt like he was using me until he found a place &amp; I was mad that he was lying so I figured he could take the couch money &amp; get a hotel. (I let him live with me rent free for a month &amp; then not even pay half the mortgage because I didn‚Äôt think he had money.) I also knew that when he left his last gf he never told her. He packed his shit while she was at work &amp; took off. Well- he didn‚Äôt respect my wishes to take space. He was like babe...babe...babe and finally just said he was going to come &amp; get some clothes. I told him I was going to try to sleep because my job had been super stressful &amp; dealing with this was horrible &amp; I just needed a clear mind. He ended up coming in, SLAMMED the door so I woke up startled &amp; starting packing all of his shit &amp; putting it in his truck. I told him to stop. I just wanted a night of distance. His face was white. I never saw him so angry. He packed his truck &amp; wouldn‚Äôt speak to me. I asked him for the key since he was being an asshole. I didn‚Äôt want him doing that again. He left. He wouldn‚Äôt tell me where he was. He ended up blocking me on every level &amp; hasn‚Äôt talked to me in two years. I don‚Äôt know why but that was the most intense pain I have ever felt in my life. I wouldn‚Äôt wish it on anyone. I thought he really loved me. I thought he was my forever. I never trusted a man so much &amp; had them hurt me so badly. I never in a million years expected this from him. Ever. A year &amp; a half later I reached out to him at work &amp; asked if we could talk &amp; get closure and just be friends. He said no. He bought a house like 4 miles from me &amp; I want to sell my house because I am still not ok &amp; I never want to run into him- ever. I thought for like a year I wanted him back &amp; I was wrong but now I know I could never trust him &amp; so I just have to heal &amp; move on. It‚Äôs really hard though. We never even say down &amp; talked about breaking up. I don‚Äôt feel like I will ever be the same or trust someone ever again. And I am 200% sure he has probably had at least 5 girlfriends by now &amp; is enjoying his life. I don‚Äôt even leave my house because I don‚Äôt want to run into him. I really want to sell my house &amp; get the fuck out of here. My advice to you girls who want back with your exes? If they want you back- they‚Äôll find you. You broke up for a reason &amp; you probably just don‚Äôt remember right now."
"Things weren't going well when I got out of the relationship.  Overall though he was a great partner.  I fully expected after the breakup and having a break from each other we'd end up back together.  The first year was rough.  I constantly second guessed my decision.  We were kind of seeing each other during that year.  At the start he put in an equal amount of effort in things.  By the end of the year I noticed I was the one initiating and putting in all the effort again ... So I just stopped.  Our contact with each other dropped off dramatically and I started to move on.  I get lonely sometimes or whistfully go down memory lane and have so felt I really messed up here.

We had to interact with each other a couple weeks ago and within seconds of being around him my mood dropped dramatically.  It wasn't until that moment I realized just how good of a decision breaking up was and just how good of a place I was in now.  When the feeling for him were so high I was always just glad to be in his company.  Now that I've moved on and am doing my own thing I am actually pretty happy in general whereas before I was getting by waiting for potential happiness.  Until that moment we interacted where I was in a place that I wasn't so wrapped up in him I had zero awareness of how bad his negativity and belittling to me were.  

So for the first year I constantly regretted it thinking I'd made the biggest mistake of my life.  As time passed though I realized that it was a very good thing."
"Communication - it‚Äôs honestly not that difficult to simply communicate with us. If we ask you to make plans and you are busy, suggest another day. If we are vulnerable with you and share that we‚Äôre going through something, periodically check in and ask how we‚Äôre doing. Text and ask how our day is, ask what you can do to make the relationship better... so many things, but just communicate! (This is obviously a 2 way street here, but I feel as though it is more intuitive to women)."

When I was younger, I‚Äôd cope with it by learning computer coding and languages all by myself. It felt amazing to know that I knew how to do something that not everyone does. It made me feel smarter, more confident, and impressed people when I‚Äôd tell them I learned how to do it all on my own.

And no, I didn‚Äôt get a tutor or anything. I watched YouTube videos on how to do it, completely FREE. I studied Japanese three years independently to the point where I could read a lot of the alphabet and understand speaking very well. 

I don‚Äôt know if this helps everyone, but it sure did improve my self-confidence."
Basking in sunshine *with sunscreen*
"I bought two midi dresses on Friday, and didn't notice the pockets until I got home! Was Super happy!"
"You talk about getting with another guy and making it an open relationship, but you didn't say when you got back with your current SO.

Sorry, I hope my question didn't sound rude."
"She made the right decision to break it off, and then decided she needed space to think. I'm not sure if the guy is better off or not, but it just sucks that his message didn't get through, regardless of the outcome.

Maybe it would have turned out exactly the same way, but it's not fair that someone else determines and interferes in a way they see fit. It's just not up to them"
I left my soon to be ex husband in January. After years of emotional abuse I finally had enough when he lashed out at me at my dad‚Äôs funeral for not paying enough attention to him. I also found out later he made advances at my sister. Even with all that aside I still love him. It‚Äôs hard to leave someone after 15 years and every day is a struggle to not go running back to what‚Äôs comfortable even if it was psychologically damning.
"OP said she starting hanging out with her ex, and he made her feel on top of the world. Unless I‚Äôm wrong that is straight up an emotional affair. That is not someone you can trust. OP is better off unless his current SO is also a cheater"
"As someone who is in the very small size, it also affect us.

&amp;#x200B;

French sizing, I usually wear a 34. (XS, when it's with letter. 2 in US sizing according to this chart  [https://www.blitzresults.com/en/european-sizes/](https://www.blitzresults.com/en/european-sizes/) ). Number of time it's too big for me because they decided to label a size too small for vanity.

At some point 2 will become the new 6, and people will still think they're too big at 6, when they're really really thin, and this is how we create a neurotic society completely obsessed with diets."
Getting pissy or calling me a bitch when they have to do as I say when I'm in a position of authority over them.
"Man as the person who doesn‚Äôt want kids, I feel bad for him. 

It really makes you feel like you aren‚Äôt good enough for anybody. So you either live a life alone without somebody to share it with, or you have kids that you don‚Äôt want and end up regretting. 

I‚Äôm going with ‚Äúliving my life alone‚Äù because I‚Äôm a woman and I refuse to carry a child for many, *many* reasons that I‚Äôm not going to get into here. 

Like, we‚Äôre this whole ass person with dreams and ambitions and goals that we just want to share with our SO, and then people expect us to trash them for children because it‚Äôs what you‚Äôre ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to do. So few people are willing to experience life without kids, the childfree community is super small even in heavily populated areas. 

You were right to break up with him though. The kids alone thing is enough. Can‚Äôt compromise on those."
"I have a same experience with the ""positive vibes only"" people. Force and fake, and feel uncomfortable around them. And I am a naturally optimist and postive person. But yeah sometimes things sucks, you're down on your luck, you're sad because things are sad. Let us have a moment to mourn, to get angry a bit, to be disappointed. 

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't seem normal to always be 100% positive about everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also I often feels that they don't take problems and issues seriously."
"Not a divorce but a failed engagement. I gave the band back to him because it was his grandfather‚Äôs. That was 20 years ago. The ‚Äúengagement‚Äù ring, I gave to one of my best friends to give to her daughter, so she has a piece of jewelry that‚Äôs all her own and she won‚Äôt fall for the first boy who buys her something shiny. It was only worth $150 in the first place."
"‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt belong, don‚Äôt be long‚Äù. Took me a bit to realize that the crowd I was hanging out with wasn‚Äôt going anywhere but downhill."
"It‚Äôs possible to go to a lunch or dinner with a guy friend and it not be a date.

I completely LOATHE being told that having guy friends is horrible because ‚Äúall guys want to sleep with you because that‚Äôs how guys work‚Äù but you can go to lunch with female friends because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not like those guys and I love you.‚Äù"
"It seems like more and more pants are designed to trick you into thinking they've got pockets. I've been burned twice the past month by pants that are designed to look like they have front pockets but lack any actual pocket

Not the biggest deal but i am someone who prefers function over form"
"About 20 days after breaking up I sort of forced myself into a relationship, ended up being convinced to make it an open relationship with a guy I'd known for a long time. We were together for maybe 9-10 months if not a year?"
I will never understand why scented tampons are even a thing that's sold. Why the hell would I want tampons that smell like flowers!?
"I kind of feel like it‚Äôs the opposite: that everybody is talking upgrade jobs as this obvious solution to the student debt crisis while ignoring how physically demanding many trade jobs are (meaning you can‚Äôt do then when you‚Äôre old, can‚Äôt do then if you‚Äôre injured, can‚Äôt do then if you have many disabilities, etc., not to mention that they fuck your physical health over time) and the fact that while they have high out-of-school pay, they average lower lifetime pay than white-collar jobs.

It kind of creates this idea that student debt isn‚Äôt really a problem‚Äî students are just too snobby to take these high-paying jobs right in front of them. When really, the high pay is front-loaded and you‚Äôre going to wind up having to go back to school when your back gives out anyway.

I‚Äôm not saying trade jobs aren‚Äôt great, but they‚Äôre not this obvious perfect solution nobody has thought of. They have both pros and cons."
"I agree with everything you just said. I had similar experience at work. Management made a bunch of changes that benefit no one and everyone was miserable.  The supervisors/managers just kept telling us to ""stay positive"" and how having a ""positive attitude"" makes all the difference. ""Staying positive"" didn't change the work situation, we just felt ignored and invalidated. Downplaying how bad the new work environment was, made people leave. I left, and found a job that makes me happy and gives me a more positive attitude/outlook, without forcing it."
"Kept the wedding ring since it was fairly plain and can still be worn on other fingers. There is no emotional tie to it, it's honestly just a versatile piece of jewelry. Sold the engagement ring to a couple who I hope had better luck than me and used the money to pay for me and my best friend to go on a beach vacation. No regrets. Best vacation ever."
"I have long arms and legs and most clothes arent made for those either. Clothes generally arent made for long people, even if they seemingly have bigger sizes they are not proportionate enough."
"Therapy and exercise! Exercise did wonders for my overall mental health. Vitamin D is also very important for brain health, so if you‚Äôre low on it, take some supplements or get outside and sit in the sun for a bit."
"This. Married at 19 &amp; 20, just had 27th wedding anniversary. I do my thing, he does his but we also have things that we only do together. I think that communicating is the other major component. When there is conflict, work against that conflict and not each other."
"Came here to say this. There are a few documentaries about this, one called ‚ÄúChina Blue.‚Äù"
I am the same way. It took me actually being confident that I knew what I was talking about before I found my voice. Confidence is everything.
"Sorry, I know the question is awkwardly worded. Basically I'm 29 and am constantly told I look like a teenager, and not in a complimentary, ""cute"" kind of way. I'm 5'6"" and kind of lumbering, with a perfectly circular, very broad, plain baby face. I've gotten that I'm intimidating a couple times in my life, but for the most part I get steamrolled over by people I don't know, and my asserting boundaries makes a few of them sort of short-circuit and go berserk. This has been a theme in my personal life but it really becomes evident to me when I'm at work. I've had it where I tell someone no and give them the reason, they start pitching a fit, and I call my manager -- who is four years younger than me -- over, she tells them literally verbatim what I just told them, and they go ""Oh, okay."" And leave. 

Even on my best take-no-shit days, I don't look like someone who should be taken seriously. I feel like I could have a fucking gun in my hand and still get laughed out of the room for asserting even the most basic boundary. This isn't just a workplace thing, either. 

I'm working on the personal aspects of this, because it obviously isn't just how I look. But I have been told a few times that I don't look like the kind of person whose opinion matters, as one of them put it. I don't know what to do about it, and I don't know how to carry myself differently without it being obvious that I'm compensating."
In swimsuits it's there to catch the sand and make you look like you shat yourself.
"As a trans woman; I'll chime in here.  Estrogen makes nipples much more sensitive.  When  someone who was assigned male a birth is put on estrogen, their nipple sensitivity tends to increase."
"I'd gladly pay a little more for clothes that were made ethically and actually lasted. The cheap, fast fashion that we buy today doesn't last."
"This happened with my wedding dress - the shock, awe and euphoria was overwhelming."
"It‚Äôs not pregnancy, but no one tells you about recovery. I had a very difficult recovery but a really easy labor and delivery. No one talks about recovery at all. 

I always suggest people read The Lemon Clot Essay.

As for pregnancy I didn‚Äôt realize your feet could grow or make your eyesight worse. Both things happened to me."
"My mother forced me to go to church growing up and I still remember being shamed by the preacher the day after my birthday party because ""young girls shouldn't wear revealing attire such as bathing suits, as it can tempt the eye of a Christian man"" 


I had invited him to my birthday party, since I lived in Florida, the party was at a spring."
"I think there's stuff like transparent bra straps, bra tapes, elastics which you can attach to the hooks of your bra and wrap them around your stomach + lower back and attach them securely with each other.

However, I get you, it's extremely annoying to have to invest in these options if you want to buy a particular shirt, or if a dress has no padding."
"I couldn‚Äôt imagine this feeling. I‚Äôm sorry you had to experience this loss (as long ago as it was) and I hope you have a fantastic rest of your life.

I‚Äôm sure, at the very least, you left him the happiest he could ever be. The feeling you get when the girl you‚Äôve been crushing on for so long is the least bit interested in you is a magical one."
"I buy Levi jeans. I have two that are exactly the same size and style (they number their styles) and one is so loose I can slip it on without undoing the zipper and one is so tight that I cry sometimes when I have to sit for long periods.

I have multiple pairs of this style and they're all like that, slightly different in size, so it's not even like one pair was just sized wrong. And they're all the same style, so it's not like one is stretch and the other isn't. These things are $70 (not that I've ever paid that much) and they can't even make the size consistent?"
Masturbation
"I actually just asked Google and got the answer and am now less nervous/embarrassed...

Is it normal for my vagina to bleach my panties? 

Because I've noticed that some of my panties have a white stain that looks like bleach...

The answer is apparently, yes. It's also a sign of a healthy vagina so, go me, I guess..."
r/lostredditors ?
Finding a partner...well it shouldn't be 'promised' to anyone but when you're constantly told 'you'll find someone!' for years it's hard not to get resentful
"Did I miss out on some core experience of growing up that teaches you adult things? Like how to wear makeup, dress well, balance a budget, buy insurance, how to look for jobs, where to get this info? Or are we all just floundering around watching YouTube hoping the person making the video got an actual lesson somewhere?"
"This! I absolutely try my hardest to be ‚Äúglass half full‚Äù in the way I live my life, just don‚Äôt tell me how to feel lol"
"That's really beautiful actually! It's sort of like that trick when you're anxious about all the ways you might have looked stupid or fucked up at a party and how everyone's judging you, the reality is they're all anxious about their own shit."
"This use to happen to me, at work and it might sound ‚Äúshallow‚Äù or whatever but I changed the way I dress and I command more respect.
I used to sort of wear more ‚Äúcasual‚Äù clothing to work and now I make it a point to have every work outfit on point and extra professional.
I don‚Äôt know if it will help you, but just a suggestion. It really helped me.

Instead of wearing round toed shoes for example, I got a pair of pointy toed flats or I wear pointy toed heels.
I got a lot of button up shirts instead of t-shirts
And I make sure all of my pants are the right length, and that they look ironed and professional. When I‚Äôm walking at work now, I feel more confident, prepared and professional.

Some co-workers are haters and will say things like ‚Äúwhy are you all dressed up now‚Äù, it made me feel better about myself too."
Teaching kids about LGBTQ relationships. Unfortunately there's certain vocal parts of society who vehemently oppose this.
"My old roommate was a guy and wasn't doing the dishes very often, so I started washing only my dishes right after I used them"
Oooof my heart hurts after reading this one :( I hope you find happiness and I hope he does with his new wife as well.
"""you'll get to travel, just focus on your career first"" 

I still haven't travelled and all my friends who did travel are in exactly the same, or better, position than me."
"This is my major complaint. For fks sake, STOP making see through clothes!!!!! No I don‚Äôt want to wear three layers to cover my shit."
"That irritating, horrible whining that badly behaved children (usually around the age of 3/4) make when they don't get their way. 

I mean, I am not fond of children and most loud sounds they make, including screaming when they play, annoy me, but that certain wailing just makes me want to chuck them out of a window."
"I am happy to see a generation of men being raised to pick up their socks and care for themselves. But there are women out there who have done a disservice to their son's future wives by not teaching their boys not only how to clean but to take responsibility for the cleaning. Don't make me tell you what to do, that is emotional labor, I ain't got time for that."
"Hey there I just wanted to clarify something quickly. I didn‚Äôt have an emotional affair or a physical one at that. My ex came back out of the blue, said all the right things, and rather than cheating I decided to break things off with the guy I‚Äôm now regretting breaking up with. 

Things were kind of whirl-windy. I was already feeling like I was settling so as soon as I got that message I was like ‚Äúyes this is a sign I need to break up‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt think things through and that is why I am in the predicament that I am in."
How dishonest a lot of people are.
"Idk. Seems like too obvious an answer, but fourth-wave feminism."
"My mother sold it when she needed money to feed us. Says she would have sold it eventually, anyway."
"I was going to say the exact same thing. 

I can relate to this so much. Also thought depression and anxiety were just part of my personality. 

I felt ashamed to ask for medication because I saw it as me being a failure. But honestly, it has helped me a lot so I‚Äôm glad I swallowed my pride. It took a couple of tries to find the right fit but I am definitely feeling like myself again. So yes, please consider it if you haven‚Äôt already!"
"Hell, even some pants and skirts are see-through. I was trying on some pink jeans at the store and was gobsmacked when I could see the pattern of my underwear through the material!"
"A few weeks ago I was looking at old selfies and pictures of myself (from anywhere from 2 years -6 months ago) and was texting my friends saying ""Look at this picture! I was so cute in this picture! And happy! Look how amazing I looked!"" And the group chat responded- ""Girl you still look like that!"" Warmed my heart üíì"
"I hate this so much. I see things all the time that *look* super cool, and then I'm hit with ""wait, how would I actually wear this though?"" It's super annoying."
Full disclosure: it was a prom dress that was perfect (and 1000X cheaper) than any actual wedding dress I tried on lol the pockets were just the cherry on top
"My breakdown came about 3-4 weeks after the baby was born. Those first 3 months were the hardest months of my life, mentally speaking. Our son was a wonderful sleeper and didn‚Äôt cry a lot, but PPD had a dark hold on me and I didn‚Äôt reach out to my doctor soon enough."
"I just buy on the man‚Äôs section now, it‚Äôs also soo much cheaper."
"Titties up, nails done, hair down, with a bad-bitch walk; stand tall with your shoulders back and put a little swing into your hips. If I don't have the confidence, faking it usually helps to bring it back unless I'm in a super low depression downswing."
"Hate it.  

Healthy people all the time tell me to ""think positive"".  Listen fuckers, if I want to be upset that my body is trying to off itself, I damn well will.  Let me feel my feelings before I beat you with my cane."
women need pockets. i'm not a woman but it still irritates me.
Bathing suit shopping is a nightmare. Even long torso suits aren't long enough and sizing up means they fit horribly.
"I was 23 when we met, and 13 years later, we‚Äôre still deeply in love.   We‚Äôre make it a point to be physically affectionate.  Not necessarily sex, but touching, kissing, and cuddling on the couch.  We say I love you every time we talk on the phone and by text.   It‚Äôs easy to become more like roommates if you‚Äôre not careful.  Remember that he‚Äôs also your lover and best friend."
Razors
"I'm 5'10"" and I hate how every single shirt I like stops about 6 inches too short."
"This is what I do too. The men's section also has nice, plain, basic, VERSATILE items unlike the women's where everything has to have a weird hem, or random bows, or whatever other nonsense."
How many clothing stores sell petite in store but tall as online-only. Just have sections for both in the store.
"Calling the number of people you've had sex with a ""body count"". 

Anything about ""thots"", which is just a new way to slut shame."
"It‚Äôs not something I heard, but rather what I saw and it resonated. I was driving, bawling my eyes out, and on the side of a building in big green, graffiti was the phrase ‚ÄòHang In There.‚Äù So I did."
"T H I S. I'm also not a beauty standard (overweight, baby face, some acne, generally a mess) but I'm happy so ??? my life is so much more than that"
"Women interested in maly stuff, hobbies are just seeking for attention"
To trust my gut/instinct.  If you feel like something isn‚Äôt right or doesn‚Äôt add up it‚Äôs probably because it‚Äôs true.
"Thank you for sharing. I‚Äôm going through this right now üòû
Not fully in the regret place but I can see it bubbling eventually"
"‚ÄúI‚Äôd like some rights and respect pls‚Äù

So what you‚Äôre saying is that you want to genocide all men and start a new human population with the sperm of the top 1% chads so that the new males won‚Äôt have male influence to corrupt them? Stupid feminist. Don‚Äôt you know that it‚Äôs in mens nature to dominate the females? Your plan will foil and a new generation of better, smarter men will rise up and make females go extinct."
And it seems like every cute shirt now is a crop top??? Why!?
"Swimming pool chlorine! (smells like fun, but also chemicals).

Smoke!  (marshmallows but also danger).

Windex! (Idk with this one, I just like it)."
"Most wonderful man in the world, but I wanted to go to college single and see what was out there. No most wonderful men in the world, that's for sure."
"""Someday, this will be a story you can tell your grandkids about.  Something to inspire them, like when you hear about your ancestors and the badass women they were.  Be that story."""
"I relate to this so much. It's so frustrating. I get told I'm angry and bossy for just saying ""hey, I don't like that/I disagree/please don't do that"". But if I don't say anything I get talked over, patronised, and spoken down to."
"Have you heard about ""No zero days""?  The idea is doing something, even 1-2 reps of exercise, is better than doing zero.  

Some people have made chain calendars so they can track their non-zero days and it's motivation to at least do something."
Pink camouflage. How on earth is that ever practical?!!
"I literally tell myself ""Its okay to feel this way, and even if nobody else would think its valid, if is to me"". Staying focused on things, and keeping my mind occupied on one thing at a time tend to help too."
"The last conversation I ever had with my father was me _begging_ him to see a doctor. I wasn‚Äôt sure what was wrong with him, but I could tell that something was completely off. He finally got himself to the doctor several days later, needed several surgeries by that point, and never woke up. He was a largely healthy, happy guy, and there‚Äôs no reason why he wouldn‚Äôt have lived another 20+ years if he‚Äôd just skipped being manly about how awful he felt and gone to the doctor immediately FOR FUCKING FREE. I‚Äôll pretend that I‚Äôll stop being mad about this at some point in my life, but I don‚Äôt really think so. 

Fuck your idiot pride into infinity. See the fucking doctor."
"I realized it was eventually going to tear us apart and that love just isn't enough for a lasting relationship. I'm now with someone who tells me daily how much he can't wait to get married and have kids, and live out the dreams I've always wanted. The heartbreak of ending things with my ex was 100% worth finding my boyfriend. I went through a period after breaking up with my ex thinking maybe I should just suck it up and get back with him, and forgo my dreams. But I've seen people do that and they end up miserable. So I ended it because it wasn't fair to either of us."
"&gt;Staying positive can be helpful, but being told to stay positive is not.

This is an important distinction. I agree with you."
"I‚Äôm with you. I was previously a negative/cynical person. Changed my mindset, began reflecting and digging deeper into why I was having negative thoughts/feelings, how can I grow from it, etc. I wake up each day with the mindset I get to choose my attitude. Same point you make - no power over others yet do have power over myself. It‚Äôs made a world of difference for me and has helped me better deal with things when the shit really gets real."
With your *wedding* dress?? That's so cool!!
I think it‚Äôs in an old purse. Thank you for reminding me.
"I so understand this! I have lost several amazing guys due to this. 
I'm currently with someone absolutely wonderful, who only asks that we dance together in public, no other affection. It is so nice to have that understanding. Don't give up, you'll find someone who understands."
And it's not like it's a rudely ordering thing or anything it's just diplomatically reminding and asking until we develop good habits that keep things nice...
"I hate it when people don‚Äôt know geography, just the basics is fine but not knowing where your own damn country is just damn stupid"
"Thanks. I can't believe all these comments complaining about pockets and sizing when almost all clothing we wear is a result of slave labor. Just another sign of our lack of information about these problematics.

We can change it. We have to."
"Currently going through something similar. It sucks to say the least. We both had feelings for eachother, just at different times. She is/was my bestfriend.  Went from talking all day everyday about everything and anything to currently not speaking at all. I have no idea how this will turn out but I know she‚Äôs currently mad at me so reaching out doesn‚Äôt seem like the best option right now."
Veganism
I dislike the cold shoulder stuff so much lately. Same with rompers! The amount of times that I found a what i thought was a cute dress and it turns out to be a romper.
"A thousand times this.  So, your SO asks you to do one thing all day.  Instead of speaking a simple sentence (ALOUD, so she can hear it, not ‚ÄúMentally, in your mind‚Äù), you decide to be a passive-aggressive jerk about it, because HOW DARE you be asked by a mere woman to contribute one thing to your household, when you‚Äôre just starting your very important fourth straight hour of video games of the evening.

Ungrateful female should take out the garbage her own damn self, right?  And beer you while she‚Äôs up, thank you very much.

Deal breaker, indeed."
All skirts and shirts art too short nowadays. I like my ass covered thank you!
It is literally one of the biggest things. Any true fight my husband and I had has been because of poor communication.
"That something can be very wrong with your baby and you don‚Äôt even know it until after it‚Äôs born. So wrong that it can die without any warning or preparation. 

Doesn‚Äôt it always seem like everyone talks about the miscarriages and stillbirths? Once you‚Äôre past that point you feel like you‚Äôre in the clear. 

I had a baby a month ago and it was a beautiful birth of a 37-week-old seemingly perfectly healthy baby boy, and he died 15 hours later because he had a random genetic mutation with abnormalities that made it impossible for his lungs to work. 

I, nor anyone else, knew this was the case at all. His ultrasounds looked perfect and he was active and normal sized with a great sounding heartbeat, but little did we all know that he was never going to survive after he was born. I brought my son home last week in an urn instead of in his car seat. 

My advice in all of this is get your genetic testing done. As much of it as they can offer. My baby‚Äôs genetic mutation was so random and rare that it doesn‚Äôt even have a name and in the end it was just a really bad luck of the draw when I got pregnant. So don‚Äôt get paranoid that it will happen to you. Just do what you can do to keep that baby and yourself safe. 

Cherish every single second, mamas! Even the horrible parts of pregnancy are shared with a precious gift."
"I am annoyed about lack of transparency in terms of where my clothes came from and where they were made. 

I don‚Äôt know how I would fix this other than writing to the company asking if they would seek this out themselves then have a tab of some sort on their website explaining and showing where the clothes were made or the factory it was made in, as one idea."
"As a woman, I've always been kind of disappointed that my nipples do absolutely nothing for me. Zero sensitivity. I kind of wonder sometimes what it feels like to have something going on there."
"Men acting like human beings such as crying, being scared or whatsoever that the society condemns because those things are not ""manly""."
"women who have quit social media would not be here, a social media site"
"A lot of the stuff you prepared might not work once the baby arrives. 

I wanted to be a crunchy mom and most of what I planned went out the window once I gave birth.  We barely used the changing table or crib because we coslept and just changed her on the ground. Wipe warmer was useless.

I gave up on cloth diapers after a week.

Breastfeeding was way harder than some people made it out to be. 

Oh and when the baby nurses you can get an odd ‚Äúturned on‚Äù feeling by it. No one tells you that‚Äôs a thing."
"Were you able to become friends again after some time? My ex broke up with me recently for similar reasons, which I've come to accept, but I really miss having him in my life as a friend. =/"
How do you get the strength to actually do it?
Sewing a closed gusset is more complicated than sewing an open gusset. Lots of manufacturers go with open gusset because it's cheaper and quicker to produce. Open means the weird little pocket.
say s i k e right now
I hate that. If I'm ever upset with my male roommates they dismiss my feelings as hormones rather than admit that they had a hand in why I'm upset.
"Clothes with brand makes on them, I don't like paying a company for the ""privilege"" of advertising for them."
"I tave up with normal stores. I just shop thrifts. 

""Oh look, mom jeans with a tapered skinny leg. Just what I want to look like, a denim ice cream cone.:"
"Oh God, the body hair shit is so infuriating. I asked a friend to name a few of my personality flaws for self improvement sake, and he goes ""Body hair. You should give it a try"".
First of all... that's not a personality flaw. Second! I gave it a try and that's how I came up to the conclussion that I DON'T WANT TO WASTE MY TIME ON IT! People really think that those of us who don't shave are lazy, don't they?"
"My mom eats super healthy, had even cut processed sugar out of her life, and works out tons and is still overweight. She's also super fashionable and *loves* to dress up.

The number of times I've seen her close to tears because of the ugly crap they sell in the women's/plus size section makes me so angry I want to punch the world."
"I was JUST telling my boyfriend about this. I have not been able to find a woman‚Äôs shirt with more than 3 or 4 inches of sleeve at most. And they are usually cut at an angle. And of course most people sway their arms a bit when they walk, so they are constantly riding up and I‚Äôm constantly pulling at them and dealing with arm sweat. I‚Äôve tried shopping in the men‚Äôs T-shirt department but then there‚Äôs no room for my tits. Can‚Äôt a girl just buy a fucking T-shirt without trying to maximize her skin exposure and ‚Äúlook sexy‚Äù. I just want a normal T-shirt!!!!"
I've made a huge ass of myself in an identical manner. Please update. Lol
Body confidence when you don‚Äôt look like the girl in the magazines. Especially boobs bro! I literally got told by a female doctor that there‚Äôs something wrong with how my boobs looked and I was insecure for years after that. Sure they aren‚Äôt perfect but there‚Äôs no way every single person can live up to the perfect standard of boobs. It‚Äôs pathetic - they come in all shapes and sizes.
"Before we got married, my husband and I wanted to make sure that marriage was the right decision for us. So we asked each other a bunch of questions about money, the division of labor in the home, etc. We were compatible, but we were too agreeable - it ended up becoming more of a conversation. 

So, we found a bunch of hypothetical scenarios - some more ridiculous than others - to decide how we would handle it. Some scenarios included ""you partner's parents are on the west coast, your dream job is in the east coast. You have been living in the east coast with your partner for a while when your partner's parents get extremely ill. What do you do?"" and ""you're tired, and you can only do three chores in the house for the day, what are they? What three chores do you not mind doing?"" 

It was really fun because we got to learn that we saw eye to eye about how we want to support our parents and what we are willing to compromise in the relationship to make that happen. We learned that I like washing dishes but hate cooking (he loves to cook and is damn good at it) so he generally cooks and I generally clean. We also traded chores - I don't mind taking out the trash and cleaning the toilet and he doesn't mind planning our Costco runs and being proactive about our finances."
And every single white shirt ever is see through no matter what. I can literally be wearing a white bra and you can still see it very clearly through the shirt. I don‚Äôt want to have to wear a tank top to work in order to look professional. It‚Äôs 90 degrees out I didn‚Äôt sign up for more layers.
"The fabrics they use don‚Äôt help either. Why are they so thin and almost see-through? They don‚Äôt fall in a flattering manner, and you can totally, absolutely see nipples‚Äô outline, not as in shape (although that too), but in color! Wtf, people."
So underrated
"&gt;My advice to you girls who want back with your exes? If they want you back- they‚Äôll find you. You broke up for a reason &amp; you probably just don‚Äôt remember right now.

I disagree with this piece of advice. If we want you back, we will not find you.

My ex broke up with me, and I also had my trust broken with her by the same discussion you had. I want to get back together with her every day, but I don't because I respect her decision. I blocked her every way I can because I cannot handle the thought of being able to check up on her. If she talked to me about it I would certainly be open to a discussion. But I'm not going to crawl back to her to ask her to pick up something she already threw away, and has made no sign of wanting it back again. If you want him back you should tell him if you broke up with him.

Your last piece I do agree with. If you broke up with him you had a reason and probably don't remember. Nothing would be worse than breaking each other's heart again so please be certain."
"""The way you speak to yourself affects how you feel."""
"Met and started at 19 in 2011, engaged now. A lot of people are saying ""communication"" and that's a common answer on these questions but so few people explain what that is.

If there is something bothering us, we talk about it. We don't get accusatory, we don't judge, and we absolutely don't yell. We listen to each other and and try to keep things in mind. Even if something isn't important to you, it might be to them and if you want to show them that you respect and love them, you do your best to do that stupid little thing you don't understand. 

Know that you are worth all the same that you give and don't accept a partner not willing to pull their weight. If they're not, bring it up ""hey, you haven't been doing xxx lately, is there something up?"" Be patient but also give deadlines.

Check in on each other. If you're at that point, be uncomfortable and discuss finances. Be on the same page about your future - houses, pets, kids, goals, etc."
"Music is my go to! I personally like dancing and even when I‚Äôm in a down mood a good song or two can pull me out of it enough to dance! Songs by Beyonc√©, Ariana Grande, Rihanna, etc. 

Lizzo in particular makes me feel like a sexy, confident, boss ass bitch every time. A lot of her songs are about self love and embracing what makes you you. 

Some particular favorite:

- Soulmate
- Good as Hell
- Coconut Oil
- Juice
- Fitness"

"I bought clothes from the app Wish for a while. A lot of comments would say, ‚ÄúThe seams were backwards! It looked like a child sewed it!‚Äù I started realizing that it probably was sewn by a child and I had no idea I was supporting it. Then I found out how many other stores use child/slave labor and it made me feel sick. We do have to change it, it‚Äôs atrocious."
Had a girlfriend that had twins and about a week after she was home had a complete breakdown. And ended up in the psych ward. They said she had a hormone imbalance and it just put her over the edge.
"‚ÄúThe True Cost‚Äù is also a super informative documentary, I think it‚Äôs available on Netflix. For everyone who‚Äôs not aware of these issues I highly recommend watching!"

"You could be describing me and when I was a telephone operator it was really really weird that women would regularly tell me I sounded like a little kid and men would tell me my voice was sexy. Always creeped me out.

"Chances are, it's not actually fading, you're just becoming accustomed to the scent and it's still quite fragrant to others who sit near you."
"Not so much a *promise* as an *assumption*, but good health. I ended up disabled as an adult and despite my best efforts, no matter how hard I try, I can't lead a normal life, I can't keep up with others and it does have a negative impact on all areas of my life. I try to make the best of things, but the only thing that hurts more than my joints is the daily disappointment of frequently falling short."
"So very much annoys me about buying clothes.   

The main things I‚Äôm going to vent about today are not being able to easily discern conditions under which they are made ( both worker conditions and if it‚Äôs an animal fibre, the farming welfare or also if it‚Äôs a plant fibre the worker conditions/ farming conditions ) 

The second is that looking for natural fibre clothes/ predominantly natural fibre clothes is not a search option buying on line and your choice is often natural fibre or shape/ size choices."
This was not the reply I was expecting on this sub but damn am I glad it's here üëèüëè
"I‚Äôm not really babyfaced, but relatively short (5‚Äò5 or 1.66m) and fit the ‚Äûdumb blonde‚Äú-look stereotype I guess.

I‚Äôll have to admit, I often use it to get men to do work for me. Like, ‚ÄûI have to carry a 60 liter beer keg? Hey Tom, would you mind real quick?‚Äú. Or even stuff like reaching the top shelf, so I don‚Äôt have to jump or climb counters. 

When I do need to be taken seriously, I usually just become cold. For example, a customer was very condescending and even got touchy, so I yelled at him in front of everyone and gave him a single warning to stop. He called me some condescending shit again though, so I proceeded to ignore him for the rest of the shift and told him to turn to my boss. 

The worst thing to do is getting angry or even crying - which involuntarily has happened to me before out of sheer frustration or rage. Makes everything a lot worse."

"  Schwartz's 4 Steps was designed for helping people in OCD-related attacks, but it works wonders for any situation where you're stuck in a rut.  


1. RELABEL - recognize the anxious thoughts or the lethargy. State how it feels (out loud if possible).
2. REATTRIBUTE - remind yourself that the depression/anxiety isn't you. It's not even a part of you. It's a thing that you're experiencing, nothing more.
3. REFOCUS - this is the hardest part. After recognizing those things, find ONE thing that you make a habit out of changing your attention to. It can be reading, going for a short walk, doing 10 push-ups, cleaning your room, cooking, math games in your head -- it doesn't matter. Just teach your brain to do the same thing when that's happening to you. (It gets easier).
4. REVALUE. Recognize any progress you make. Try to not judge yourself for any setbacks.

Some parts of this, especially the re-focus activities, might fee silly at first. Do them anyway. There are three main parts of your brain that are affected by you breaking the cycle of depressive or anxious thoughts, way before you feel a difference. And if all else fails, a strong cup of coffee is always helpful for kicking yourself back into gear.

"As clich√© as it sounds, I learned that I should like the person for whom they are and if I find myself trying to make them be someone else, I should probably be with someone else. Context - I met my ex-husband when we were 20 and just starting college, partying was part of that age/setting. 7 years later I just didn't feel like I want to party and get stinking drunk every weekend anymore. I found myself being with an alcoholic who liked to party all the time, I tried to make him change, be more ""mature"", didn't go anywhere. That's how I realized if I want him so badly to be someone else, I gotta let him go and I did just that."
I‚Äôm one of them then lol
"They‚Äôre meant to be opened. That little stitch keeping the pocket closed is just to make the garment look smooth for display. Some people prefer to leave it like that so it stays smooth, but it‚Äôs expected that the customer will remove that stitch."

"You pretty much described my experience of being a short, babyfaced, Asian American in her twenties. All of these things combined make for some pretty minimizing assumptions. Who takes the ""cute little Asian girl"" seriously? I think, ""You're so tiny."" is the most annoying comment I get. Oh, and the head pats...like who does that? At work is where it gets pretty frustrating. 

I voice some good ideas and solutions at work (higher ed setting), and noticed that if I chime in and offer the idea first, it gets dismissed. Then, someone comes along at the next meeting, some dude usually, and offers the SAME idea. Boss goes, ""Oh, that's a good insight Jake."" \*points to me\* ""Can you look into that?"" 

I've gotten accustomed to proving people wrong ( I know, not the most healthy). I tend to take more initiative, work more efficiently just to be at the same level as these louder, less experienced men. Eventually I earn the credibility, and it is something I can be proud of, but holy shit it is exhausting."
Every woman on the planet is after guys wallets. Its always the guys that don't even have any substantial money that claims it. What am I even digging bro? I earn more than you lol
"I lost a lot of weight and though I‚Äôm definitely skinny I‚Äôm not exceptionally small or anything. However, when shopping, S/XS is sometimes still too big. I guess vanity sizing is so out of control now that being this size means I can barely find things that actually fit me which is insane. I really wish we could go back a little bit and account for those of us that need a smaller size!"
"I thought my SO would be sweet, caring, great father, handsome, funny, successful. I didn‚Äôt know about the package- blonde or brunette. I hoped we‚Äôd have a great sex life.

"Asian sizes. I can't even get stuff in some of the shops on ebay.

Agreed. Occupation need not just be work-related.

"Post natal sweats. Oh.My.God I was dripping every night for like 3/4 months. It was like a plumber had come and installed taps in my armpits and these taps were out of my control. I felt so gross for ages until they finally went away. And no one warned me. Not a single woman in my life has apparently had this, so I'm spreading the word."
"Um....why wouldn't I?  My goal is to park as close to the building as possible.  It's not like a bathroom stall, where your car needs privacy during the day...."

"Yes, I agree with this entirely. People who have never experienced this don't understand that you can't just snap out of it. I was in a terrible depression in 2008, like I could barely eat, couldn't get out of bed, etc. I lost 30 lbs. People would say ""why don't you take a walk outside"" or ""you really need to just move on"". Like, if it were that simple don't you think I'd have a grip on this by now? I ended up on meds. Saved my life, literally."
Asking for directions and reading instructions.

"The breakup was a compulsion because I couldn‚Äôt stop obsessing over our relationship. I got my OCD treated, got back with him, now we‚Äôre married, and he just came out as a she. No one else I‚Äôd rather be doing life with. I love her so much!"
"I cant tell you how many times in my 5 years of working in a grocery store I had a man come in with a tampon or pad package and say ""my wife/girlfriend/daughter needs these"" so he cant mess it up."
It doesn't last and it's awful seeing the massive piles of clothing that don't get sold each season. Fast fashion is not worth the resources wasted and the horrible labour the workers have to go through.

"Alcohol.

You probably don't wanna take advice from me..."
"It's hard to put into words as a ""promise"" or ""statement"".

But, like, I feel so... terrible... because I feel so far behind those who were my peers. I see them in career jobs, getting married, having kids they can raise in a relatively stable environment... and here I am, working a near-minimum wage job alongside high schoolers, just hoping that someday I'll have the ability to... just... function as a normal adult.

Idk. Possible wrong thread for this, but I just had to put it out somewhere. No one else to talk to."

"Like... in eighth grade/freshman year I would go to bed with my winged eyeliner on, wake up with half of it smudged off, and then PUT A NEW LAYER ON TOP OF IT. INSTEAD OF TAKING IT OFF. OR WASHING MY FACE.

"One time when my ex and I were first talking, I was like ""hey I'm going to go see this movie Saturday after work, do you want to meet me there?"" And he was like ""maybe, that sounds fun!"" So Saturday after work I was like ""hey I'm going to see that movie, you still want to meet up?"" And he got SO MAD like ""I have a show tonight and I don't like to do anything before I have a show!"" But like why was he afraid to just say that when I first asked and just string me along with what he ""thought I wanted to hear""? It remained a pattern for much of our subsequent relationship... young &amp; dumb."
"Similarly, expected mine to be a woman, but my fiance is a dude. Otherwise he's about what I expected."
Positivity culture is classic rug sweeping. It's dismissive and invalidating to reality. I think it's a low effort way to seem helpful but in reality talk is cheap and what did those positive words achieve?  It was dehumanizing to hear it gets better. How? When? When I'm facing hard times I detest hearing it will all be ok.. Nobody knows the future and trust me it can always get worse.
Was he the one getting married? If not good luck! I hope things work out
"While those parents do deserve some flack for that I think that those men should also take some responsibility for it. People are capable of change. I was very much raised in the way that I never really had to clean or do any household chores (mainly because my mom for whatever reason didn't trust anyone else to do it right.) First few years out of the house I carried on those trends but eventually realized it was shitty and turned it around. And really, I know everyone's experience is different but I managed to make that realization before I started getting treatment for my depression so I don't think its asking too much for other men to manage. 

Funny thing is now I went from literally never doing any cleaning or chores in high school to being just like my mom as an adult where, when I have roommates or an SO, I do all the housework myself because I don't trust anyone else to do things right the first time. 

Also, I'm a man, in case that wasn't clear."
"THIS. What‚Äôs funny is every man I‚Äôve been with has asked me if I‚Äôm mad when I‚Äôm just tired/focused/neutral and then shut me out bc they think I‚Äôm mad at them.

Mind you they have the same facial expressions 90% of the time after getting off a single shift at work. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre extremely unaware of themselves until they see their behavior in someone else."
"I really liked him, but felt like he was slowly dragging me down with him. It didn't seem as if he had a goal in life. He had a lot of baggage from his past. I broke up with him thru text bc we were long distance during summer. I regretted it as soon as he replied in a sort of angry and confused tone. We never got back.

Looking at it from now. I think it was the best decision. He always wanted me to listen to his problems, but would talk me down if I offered some advice. He also didn't make an effort to see me during the summer when I asked him to make plans to see each other. There were just many red flags I didn't see until months after."
"I'm glad they've never had to go through a situation that would give them any real insight to what they're talking about. 

Given that they do have no idea what they're talking about, I think its wildly disrespectful to the victims of these situations, and I think I they'd be doing us all a favour if they kept it to themselves."
"It was Joan Baez who said, ‚ÄúAction is the antidote to despair.‚Äù"
"Not really die but stop being used by influencers or brands using it for marketing. All that slang that is thrown around a lot now (i.e. tea, shook, throwing shade, etc) originated from drag/ballroom culture which also drew from aave. It's cool seeing at least some aspects of what was once this underground culture rising in popularity but brands need to stop trying to be #relatable since imo it's cringy."
"Talking with strangers. 


&amp;nbsp;



If you want to speak with someone allow it to happen naturally, don't lurk around the grocery store for hours or follow women to the coffee counter. Most of us women are alert to the sudden appearance of a strange man in our periphery and the minute your body language gets all weird and jumpy we're checking for our exit and a potential out. A strange guy watching us or following us around isn't great, but a clearly nervous and intense guy cornering us with a come-on is pretty alarming.  

&amp;nbsp;


No, it doesn't matter how attractive you are. If you are creeping around a workplace or store and following and staring at women, you are *not* attractive. 

&amp;nbsp;


But if you walk up to us at a party or concert or happen to be sitting near us on a train, standing in front of us in line, or just stop for some small talk at the park, most of us will have no problem with flirting or small talk. There are literally thousands of social events in every city on every weekend
 So many opportunities to connect with like minded people. Get some hobbies. Build a social group. Use dating apps. Ask your friends or family to set you up. Take a class. Go to the park. If you want to chat up people, do it where people expect to socialize. 

&amp;nbsp;


Just dial the hunger back a little bit. Relax and don't stalk strangers who are just trying to get through a work day. Get a hobby. Get a bunch of hobbies. Make all the friends you can so your world isn't reduced to following strange women around the store. Grin all the time, eventually your brain will realize that an intense scowl is unsettling, but the laid back, grinning stranger is a lot more fun and interesting."
Dropped it in the ocean.
"Complete lack of understanding the implications, thinking they would love it, but failing to realize that it would seriously traumatize them. Of course, they do this in the unconscious knowledge that the odds of this happening to them are minuscule, so it makes for a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù topic."
"Yup. While I will eventually show my woodland animal side to people I'm close to, I've found the only way to make sure people know I'm serious is that strict, disapproving tone. And then they're all like, ""ohhh nooo"" and I'm like, if you had listened to me when I asked politely I wouldn't have to ""yell"" at you.

Also, a nice (resting) bitch face can get the job done. Sometimes I feel like my open, friendly, smiling face is a weakness. But really it's the people who want to take advantage of me who are at fault, not me. I can be strict teacher or smiling small friend, but I should be taken seriously either way."
Snacks if you're not a coward
"The destroyed jeans always get me. I'll see a color/fade that is perfect, up until I see all the cuts and fraying. Idk. I'm in my 20s but still find them ugly and unfashionable."
Everything fits so differently.  My husband can go shopping and know he wears a large no matter what the store is. Meanwhile at some stores I wear an XS and some I wear and XL despite my weight never changing. the worst is when the same size at the same store isn‚Äôt even the same (looking at you h&amp;m)
"Wow, you just perfectly articulated how I‚Äôve been feeling lately. I‚Äôve been living with mental illness long enough now that I know that a bad episode is only temporary and that there‚Äôs light on the other side of the tunnel. But being mindlessly ‚Äúpositive‚Äù about it won‚Äôt help or change the situation. Being resilient and mindful of the transient nature of everything will."
"Well, the experience seemed to be the kick in the butt you need to fully appreciate what you had. To motivate you to do better if you got the second chance (which you did and you had).

Maybe without the initial break-up, the relationship would've been beyond repair. You wouldn't have gotten nor wanted the second chance."
"


From 18 to 36 I am so much more aware of my body, it's workings. I know the beginning of a cold, it's course through my sinuses, lungs, throat. The twinge of ovulation. That one glass of wine too many. And physically, if I wasn't exercising, I think I would really notice stiffness and loss of muscle tone. With this all, awareness of aging, I am aware of time passing.

The sense of it shifts. One day flows into the next and I welcome the flow. I blink and it is July, I am amazed we're halfway through, but glad summer will come soon enough again. Time feels so much more precious yet my ease at its passing grows. 

My anxieties rise. Tics and mental quirks become habits and patterns without my attention. We are what we repeat. I am more concerned with establishing healthy, sustainable routines. I respect my own need for downtime (or try to). 

I value my relationships more, especially my friends I have known for a long time. I feel untethered without them; my self is intrinsically tied to those who knew the self I used to be. I miss my family and wish I hadn't been so rushed to leave. I understand why people send Christmas cards and this year it's my goal to do so.

I regret. I never did before. But I see the paths unwalked, the choices made in fear, the attempts to placate, please, to bend myself into meeting someone else's expectations.

The weight of life's small failures gets heavier.

The appreciation of life's joys has diminished.

My awareness of this makes me seek new joys. Life is hard. I'm still trying. I don't think we ever get there. It's always going to be uphill. That's okay."
"nevermind pockets, I recently bought some trousers.. that have FAKE drawstrings... just, why?"
"Huh, funny. My boyfriend's nipples seem to be much more sexually sensitive than mine. He's into that."
I 100% agree. I have a shower speaker so I can listen to music or podcasts in the shower and a sleep timer on my alarm clock that has the radio (it's an iHome clock if anyone is interested). If I can leave my thoughts behind and focus on something else then I don't feel bad
Learning your value comes with conquering each new challenge so it takes a lifetime.  I‚Äôm almost 60 and wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.
"I feel you. My parents once told me that if I didn't have any kids with my husband, he'll look for a woman that would give him a child... I felt really bad, but I actually found someone who has the same goal as me and I love him. 

It's okay to be on your own, but don't give up if you truly want to be with someone, you may find the right person, the one who has the same goals that you have."
""" you would look prettier if you smiled ""    :|"
"I feel like I just need to get the strength to do the first step, and then it gets easier from there. If I can take a shower, then I have the momentum to get dressed, walk out of the house, hop on the bus to a starbucks or a mall. I also feel extremely guilty about cancelling plans or letting people down, so if I tell someone I am going to do something or be somewhere I'm way more likely to actually do it.

But I should add I have chronic depression, not MDD, so my depressive periods may look very different and this may not be as helpful"
"I also have difficulty finding my bra size, but on the other end of the scale. I'm a 32A and almost nowhere carries sizes that small. But I can't go braless to work because god forbid anyone see the outline of a nipple. So I have to wear ill-fitting bras most of the time and I HATE it."
"So true. In general, just how difficult it is to find basic options which are **practical**. This can be in a variety of ways.

I feel like every time I see a nice looking top/dress, I pick it up and look closer and oh, wait, it's got a HUGE HOLE in the back, or weird puffy sleeves which won't fit under a jacket, or tacky detailing which makes it uncomfortable. Give me quality basics!"
"Just wanted to say thank you for that wonderful writeup - it's exactly what I'm going through in my life right now. It's validating to see someone else writing what I have found myself thinking, and wishing that the world would improve to make it possible.

Hope your situation has improved, and even if it hasn't, that you've found some support and peace."
"‚ÄúIf it doesn‚Äôt open, it‚Äôs not your door‚Äù"
"No, because he will always remain an emotionally abusive misogynist who hides behind religion in order hide the nasty core of his personality. This is only like the 2nd season of the bachelorette I've seen so idk how normal this is but it's also disgusting to not at least acknowledge that we all were watching emotional abuse/gaslighting/manipulation take place over and over again"
"I look in the mirror. 

Really, I feel like this often. I think my hair or face is too greasy, or I have something in my teeth. Or maybe my zit is noticeable Or my makeup smeared (or I look like a clown) or my hair has a bump in the part (??). 

All it takes is a glance in the mirror (for some completely irrelevant reason, e.g. I'm just going to the bathroom or legit checking if there's spinach in my teeth.

The key is to see your reflection as if a stranger is seeing you. No bias. No twisted vanity. Just neutralism. 

Or .... If that isn't your style.... What also helps is doing something you're passionate about and good at (for me, that's visual creativity like art &amp; design). ‚ò∫

Hope it helps."
"this will not be a healthy relationship.. he's not thinking straight. you didnt fall under the influence of said boy, you really need to be responsible for your own actions, and it seems like your ex doesn't want to see that"

For a second there I almost thought these were lyrics to a Lizzo song.
"I was raped when I was young. Physical touch of any kind is hard for me. And in public almost non existent. I‚Äôve come a long way since then though! 
This was years ago and now I can hold hands and even hug in public now. I just take awhile to trust."
I've honestly done that with my dad.  Given him the empty box (or front side so he doesn't need the whole thing) so he can get the ones that work the best for me.  They are not all the same...
That‚Äôs a hard no.
I pick up my cat and bury my face in his fur. He smells so good almost like cologne.

"I work on my body a lot because I don‚Äôt have an attractive face. I was born with a cleft so I have a scar from it in the middle of my face that slightly distorts my nose and lip. It‚Äôs the first place literally everyone‚Äôs eyes drift to when we talk. I can‚Äôt change it, so I try to be attractive in other areas.

I‚Äôm always in the gym to stay fit, I eat really healthy to make sure my skin stays nice and my hair looks good. I buy clothes that accentuate my curves. It also always feels good to wear shoes with a heel (high heel, boots, etc). For some reason I feel super cute when I wear a heel. 

Other than that it‚Äôs just about accepting oneself and knowing not everyone can be a model."
"One time I felt really shitty at night so I hung up string lights in the shape of colorful popsicles and just cried a little. The next day it felt so incredibly fun and good that I hung them up, so I just continued tidying my space and displaying stuff I enjoyed looking at. Now I'm almost finished with my space and I'm doing a lot better. I made plans with friends and am looking forward to that as well. Slowly I'm coming out of my self built cage and I'm doing just fine."
"And yet almost every complaint about the dating world from the man‚Äôs perspective (there‚Äôs been a string of similar threads to this on r/askmen) is ‚Äúwomen never show they‚Äôre interested and never make the first move!!‚Äù But I‚Äôve just experienced this myself: I matched with a guy on Hinge, we hit it off and I was very forward about wanting to meet him. We had a great first date, and on the second date he asked if I‚Äôd like to see him again when he got back from his vacation (this was around July 4th, we‚Äôre American). I said yes, I like spending time with you! Aaaaaaand never heard from him again.

There‚Äôs no winning sometimes."
"I had a panic attack after the anesthesiologist gave me my spinal prior to my cesarean. Scariest moment of my entire life because I knew my legs were going numb while at the same time I felt like the weight of a building was crushing my chest. I told him, ""I'm hot and I can't breathe. Please get everything off of me"" (they were putting blankets and drapes on me) it only lasted about 60 seconds maybe two minutes. Somehow I calmed down and the next thing I knew I was laying flat, they let my husband in to be with me and everything was fine. My son was safely delivered and is a rambunctious beautiful 2 1/2 year old."
"Speaking as a dude, I've never been able to have any contact with my exes beyond just remaining civil and polite. The flood of emotion always leaves me feeling shitty. I don't think it's possible to be friends with someone you cared for deeply but cant be together with. I have a few friends like me too, but we might just feel things a bit too intensely sometimes"
Like having sex with us is the only possible reason a guy would hang out with us. Not because we are cool and fun.... sex is the only reason.
Why is she asking you to take it anyway? Have you not noticed that this is a thing that needs to be done? Do you not take pride in running a tidy and efficient ship? Do you not want to take a share in the ownership of the household?
"Everyone told us it was just young love and we would grow apart- my parents, his parents, our teachers, my best friend. I was 14 and he was 17, we met in Highschool. After being together for 8 months and hearing it everyday, I broke up with him. He wouldn't let my parents take him home and decided to walk the 5-ish miles in the rain. It felt wrong when everyone told me it should feel right. I missed him every single day. I had amazing things happening in school and I only wanted to tell him. After 3 weeks he messaged me and said I left some things at his house. I asked if he wanted to hang out at the mall with me so we could still be friends. We hung out all day together and I realized I never wanted that day to end. He was going to go home that night and I cried and asked him to stay and told him I loved him and we could handle anything that may happen if we grew apart. Almost 9 years together- 3 years married and we have a 1.5 year old little girl. We've definitely grown up but its always been together and never apart."
Sorry to sound harsh but... don‚Äôt you dare take him back
"yea echoing most of the people here, i regretted it when i felt the emotional loss, but in the long run I've never regretted breaking up with any single of my ex's. I think most people in general break up when they concretely see no future"
Hairy armpits
"Everywhere, well in the USA. It is just a website that has job opportunities for places that you work/live at the same location. Lots of national parks, ski resorts, dude ranches, lakes, island, etc. 
check it out"
"All the various DH, DW, DD, DS whatever acronyms for family members. So obnoxious.

What is so hard about saying husband, wife, daughter, son?"
Eating a popsicle vs taking a jello-shot. It‚Äôs easier when everything is already outside the wrapper
Lit matches lol
Smh I did it again. It‚Äôs making me feel old.
"I started a list high school of all the things I wanted in a perfect partner. I would occasionally add to the list all the way into college. 

I found the list maybe a year ago, and it's freaky how much of the list matches my husband. I feel like I slowly wished him into being.

He's unlike anyone I dated before him. The list itself is nothing like the boys and men I was dating WHILE I wrote the list, lol. 

We've been together 17 years now, and teenage/collegiate me apparently had a few good ideas between the dumb boys!"
"That's a drag to hear. I'm giving my ex some space right now and hoping in a few weeks he'll be okay enough to talk again, but I'm worried he's ultimately going to feel the same as you and say that he can't move on while maintaining contact. We had similar issues for which there were no compromises, so when looking at things dispassionately we both know breaking up was the mature, right thing for both of us, but you're right that that doesn't really make it easier when we were happy otherwise."
It's insane because I always thought he was the smartest man I've ever met. He was always right about so much but I was so desperate for another positive male figure in my life that I let him (friend) manipulate me into thinking my boyfriend was horribly abusive and stuff and to this day have no fucking idea why I even believed that the man literally spent every hour of his life making sure I felt safe and comfortable with who I am and what I struggle with.
‚ÄúCould care less‚Äù
Irregardless is NOT a word. And no I don't want anyone linking the dictionary. Due to people using it WRONG it's become an option. IT IS STILL WRONG.
"I have the same problem! I've found my best bet is to look for cuts labeled as curvy. They're usually made with a comparable waist size to other cuts, but with more room through the hips, thighs, and butt!"
"I'd put myself in the same boat as you two. Everything you said is really great advice. I just want to add that I personally didn't get rid of all my social media, for multiple reasons. Over the course of a couple days I just unfollowed and unfriended everybody who made me feel bad about myself. I looked at a the list of people I'm following and it was easy to detect the people who gave me a toxic vibe."
"I don't say or ask everything that comes to my mind, which is a good thing for anyone with intrusive or non-productive thoughts, and I'm in a relationship with someone who wants to be around me as often as I want to be around them! It also helps to set boundaries (like if you don't live together) for how often and what type of communication is best for both of you. Basically, just be open as possible, and stay far away from people who are emotionally unavailable."
"- people with eating disorders are all thin
- innocence being associated with blonde haired, blue eyed children (bonus if said children are girls with pigtails)
- this is mostly in fiction, but ginger women being oversexualized and exotic, or sky-punching wildcards that ""arent like other girls""
- the jealous dark skinned girl
- women without ""motherly instincts"" are sociopaths
- twins always being damn near telepathic on everything and always dressing like each other"
Can't count the number of times I've picjed up a cute shirt just to flip it over and the back to be covered in random open spaces or ugly cheap lace.
"When my mother told me that ""no man will want you"" after I finished college without a boyfriend. 

I got married 3 years ago to a wonderful guy at 38. We both have our doctorates from the same university, and my family loves him."
"So when mass produced jeans or clothes are made they take large stacks of fabric that are sent off for cutting. 

These will go to a cutting machine that is set for whatever size they are doing a run of that day/shift/hour.

An industrial blade will press down and slice through the all the fabric to make many pieces ready for the sewing stations.

Because these pieces are cut in a big stack the pieces on top may end up smaller and the ones on bottom larger.

With things like jeans involving heavier fabric like denim there can be large discrepancies between pieces of the same size because of the way the fabric is cut in the factory."
"My first boyfriend, kinda, some days, whenever I had happy flashbacks, but then again I tend to forget the bad things, so I've never doubted past me did the right thing anyway. I actually only regretted a bit after years had gone by and my memory wasn't so fresh anymore lol.

I'm pinning this thread to read it again later. I'm with a wonderful guy now but I tend to feel overwhelmed easily and feel like breaking up out of nowhere sometimes. I'd hate to regret this."
"I really need to get better at this, it's so easy to just wanna lay down after work and do nothing. Even just a little time spent doing a hobby, going for a walk, etc. goes a long way!"
"Find other aspects of yourself to base your confidence in. You probably already have such traits (intellect, humor, empathy, whatever your best traits are) but even if you don't you can train them up. (Learning about a topic, honing a skill, getting into a hobby.)"
"Donald Trump. I don't hate republicans, I'm not a democrat either - But still my whole body tenses when someone mentions him. He is a disgusting human, incredibly childish and his whole propaganda stands on hate."
"I'm not insecure about it, but I am almost asocial and hate leaving the house. Luckily I found someone who's really like me in that regard anyway!"
"Graphic tees. I wear a 34 G bra and as cute as some women's shirts are, they just don't fit me as well at all. Also razors."
Get my nails done. It‚Äôs a huge confidence boost because people will notice and compliment them. Bonus points I feel like the Peter Griffin gif with the long red nails haha.
"Helping each other reach our goals and discovering new things together. 
We developed and changed a lot but somehow we kept each other in mind while doing that."
"&gt; It annoys me how inconsistent sizes are across different shops, especially with trousers.

This is my main complaint. Why do I have an XS to S in most stores, but sometimes randomly up to XL?"
"18-21 I wanted to die

24-30 (currently 26) I'm excited about life, but still hit a few low lows occasionally"
"Jeez, he found a new partner AND got married within a year? That's a bit much"
"My roommate's boyfriend's best friend. He comes over a decent amount to hang out but we've never hung out alone or anything. I do know that he is single but I would be pretty surprised if he liked me back. I mean, he is always nice and friendly to me but he's like that to everyone."
"""When you are an adult, we will have switched over to the metric system.""  Goddamn you Mrs. Cheal."
"* I do something that makes me feel useful in some way ... like I clean my house a bit, or I say a kind word to someone over reddit. Then I remind myself I CAN do things. See that thing I just did? 
* I make a plan to do more things so I have something I'm looking forward to or something that someone is relying on me for 
* I do something fun ... buy a new book to read and read it, or go on a date with my husband. (If I'm depressed enough that nothing feels fun, I just pick something that usually I would enjoy and do that anyway)
* I write a journal entry and analyse what exactly is bothering me and decide on a plan of how to address it (this only works if the pit is caused by something I can actually do something about) 
* Talking it over with friends (or failing that, a therapist) 
* Researching my mental health condition and reading about how it usually progresses and reassuring myself that this is a normal stage in the process of recovery"
"Really. Nothing wrong with the guy buying tampons for a gal. One time, my husband had to go out to buy some for me and it was the only thing he bought. He said the cashier gave him a 'look' so he said in a deadpan voice, ""They're great for plugging up bullet wounds."" He said the cashier went full whoop. When he came home and told me about it I cracked up, too. I'm so happy I married a secure man."
I like loud music and wind in my hair.  I'm usually fine before I get home.
Is performing oral sex on a vagina more difficult than performing oral sex on a penis?
"Met at 23. Not sure if that counts as early enough but.. 

People say communication. What that means for us is: 

-checking in with eachother occasionally. Are you getting what you need from me? What about what you want? Wanna try something different in bed or see how lazy we can be? Have your hopes/dreams/vision changed at all? How can we let our evolving vision for the future continue to include us both? 


-serious, somewhat sillious, loving quiet conversations about problems with eachother when they occur. Always ask why they are behaving a particular way, sometimes frustrsting behavior is a symptom of a demon they may be dealing with. 


-dogs. 



-serious goals, hobbies, dreams that have NOTHING to do with each other. 


-Never say anything negative about your SO to your friends or family. You are on the same team. Save it for your therapist. They will be much better at seeing if its you or something actually wrong anyways. 


-both of you should have a non-friend, non-family 3rd party person to talk to about the relationship. I.e. a therapist. You dont have to go regularly if you dont need to, but dont put your relationship quibbles on your friends, dont turn your mom against your SO unless you need out, and dont keep it all to youself."
