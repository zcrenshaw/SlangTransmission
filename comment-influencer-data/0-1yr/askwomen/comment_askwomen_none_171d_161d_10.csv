"Let me preface this with the fact that regret seems like a little strong of a term for how I feel- and a lot of it I’m sure is frustration. 

My whole life I didn’t particularly want kids. I had shitty parents growing up and I saw having kids as a hinderance to the type of life I wanted to live. I wanted to be able to travel often and be a workaholic. 
When I was 22 I married my (now ex) husband and he made it very clear that he wanted kids. I, wanting to be the diligent wife, obliged and spent a long time trying to get pregnant. When I was 8 months pregnant, he began an affair with an ex girlfriend that kept going until I found it six weeks after giving birth. At the time that I found it, I was DEEP into postpartum depression that lasted until my son was a year old.  Going through a divorce, being thrusted into single-parenthood, and not even knowing how to be with my son without wanting to kill him or myself was the worst experience I had ever been through. I was miserable, endangering my son, and furious that this man had put me through all of this. 
The postpartum depression has now gone and I’ve healed from the anger, but my ex husband is barely in my son’s life so I am constantly the only parent he has physically, monetarily, and emotionally. I love him more than life itself, but I can’t exactly say that if I could do it all over, I would still choose to have gotten pregnant. I still daydream of the life I wanted on a daily basis. "
"When I was about 14, this cute boy at my school was only wearing band tshirts, and one he wore a lot was a Nirvana one. 

So I started to listen to Nirvana (I had no idea who they were...), and every time he would pass me by, I would hum one of their songs. I guess I hoped he would recognise my beautiful singing and be like ""omg you like nirvana?? Me too!! Wanna be my gf?""

It did not work. He never even heard me. But I really got into Nirvana and then moved on to listening all kinds of rock music and I loved it. This helped me find my favourite genre of music, so I guess it turned out fine."
"My mom left us when I was 12 and my sister was 8, and was pretty much out of our lives until just recently (I am now 30). So, essentially, he raised two girls through puberty and into university...we were not easy on him, either! 

My dad, while not perfect, did his best and set an amazing example for two young girls. He didn’t date until both of us were older, so his focus was completely on raising the two of us. We had lots of female role models, but he was always an example of hard work and class. He never badmouthed our mom, and always sent mom flowers every year on our behalf for her birthday and Mother’s Day. 

He also made sure to let my sister and I know that if we ever needed him, anytime anywhere, he would come and get us, no questions asked. 

Neither of us really rebelled. We had no reason to. Dad made it clear that if we had a problem, we could come to him and he wouldn’t judge us. He also encouraged us to play competitive sports, which we both did and excelled in. He always tried his best to make it to every game to support us, and helped coach us to become better players. We were both extremely competitive in softball, basketball, and volleyball, so we were in sports year round.

My sister and I grew up to both have degrees and careers in male dominated fields, and we are both completely independent. Whatever he did, I think he did something right. Him and I talk once every couple of days at least, and same with him and my sister. 

I am now turning 30 and have my first child on the way (due on April 7) and I can honestly say that my dad is one of my best friends, and he’s getting the first phone call when I go into labour. 

Sorry this was kind of rambling. Normally I’m more eloquent than this, but when I talk about everything my dad did for us growing up, I get emotional and ramble lol."
Interrupt and talk over people.
I loaned him a sparkly pencil in the hope that some sparkle would wear off on his hands and he'd think of me later that day when the glitter caught the light.
"""Can you record the voicemail for my business? You've got a fantastic voice."" A friend of mine told me this and I still think about it from time to time."
"I always assume people are being friendly up until they ask me for a date or blindside me years later with ""so I have always had a crush on you""."
"I waited until I was 41 to flip the table.  I left my 19 year marriage and started over in a new town where I had just a few friends.  Lived there during the divorce process, but never really found my feet, and ended up moving to ANOTHER new town in response to a job offer.   That was a place where I knew no one, and moved with just a tiny trailer load of stuff.  

That was 8 years ago.  I've had to learn how to date as an adult, establish a career from scratch, make friends, collect enough stuff to fill an apartment, and figure out who I am as a single person.  And I've done pretty well, honestly.  My life now is a good one."
"First, I need to begin by saying that I adore my children and would do anything and everything in the world for them. That being said, I now know that I'm not cut out to be a mother to young children. 

My children are two and four and I left my job to be a stay at home mom when I was pregnant with my second and it felt like I lost a sense of my identity when I did that. Because of my husband's job, I don't have the flexibility to go back to work until they're both in school and that makes me feel like my children are trapping me in my own house. On top of that, they still need me for a great deal of things, so it feels like my entire existence is solely for the purpose of taking care of nothing but them. I have very little in my life to call my own. It feels selfish to feel like this, but I've made my peace with that. 

I hope and believe that once they're in school and my entire day doesn't revolve around them I'll be able to slowly do things for myself again and perhaps not feel like this. I see myself enjoying my kids more when we have separation during the day. But for the time being, I do find myself wishing that I never had kids. "
"I deleted Facebook because I got tired of the political rants, the soapbox screamers, the illusions, the baby pictures, the cryptic emo messages, the vanity behind selfies...it all became nightmarish. It like, wasn't real. Facebook became this illusion and an expectation among my friends. ""You didn't like my profile picture.  Can you like my picture so I have more likes than his ex? Did you see my status? Did you see how ugly so and so's baby is?"" I got rid of it and never looked back and I value my friends who I choose to keep in touch with. I don't give a shit about any of those other people, so I don't need to have them taking up space in my existence. "
"Drive slowly in the left lane. GET THE FUCK OVER!!!

“You know what I just realized? You’re jazzy as shit”
"My parents divorced when I was 9, my two younger sisters and I moved in with my dad when I was 11. My mom was (and is) bipolar and abusive so that’s why we went to live with him after the police got involved. In the two years before that he would drive 16 hours for long weekends with us (moving far away was another gem of my mom’s). Even after picking us up, me battered with a swollen face he never said anything bad against her. He spent the next 10 years fighting her in court to keep her from getting custody (what a fucking system that allows that rather than letting the kids have a voice). Anyways he was amazing. Always taught us that we could be anything. Our gender doesn’t define us, we define us and we don’t need a man to make us happy or support us. He has his flaws, but he never hide his emotions, which I think has given me a really important lesson when choosing my own partner and growing up gave me a balanced view to genders.

I’m 26 now and he’s still the person I trust and love the most. He was so supportive when I broke up with my long term partner who had been cheating. Never angry, he was very rational and thats what I needed. Other people had been angry for me, I just needed to talk out what I was feeling without judgement nor worrying about someone else’s emotions. He and I are so alike. I can’t even fathom how thankful I am for him. He was always there trying his best for us - therapy for a very angry, confused little me, buying me pantyliners when I got my first period (admittedly neither one of us knew what we were doing, but I did learn that liners are not the same as pads and I did figure out tampons eventually) and sacrificing his own financial comfort so I could chase my dreams. I love him so much for his strength through all the shit and I certainly wouldn’t be where I am without him."
My default is to assume platonic friendship unless they are being blunt about romantic interests. 
I cringe writing this out - in high school the boy I crushed on published his own zine and I plagiarized a passage so he would think I was an amazing writer.  He published it and fawned over it and then someone pointed out my lying ass.  He confronted me on it and I stammered and denied and made everything worse.  I'll forget the look he gave me.  That was like 25 years ago!
"Someone said to me that I was really smart but I did it in a way that made sure others don’t feel stupid. That meant a lot to me it was like a complement on two things that are really important to me, intelligence and being kind to others :-)"
"There was a time I found another person attractive due to how drawn I was towards the way their mind worked and how intelligent they were. I'd never found two different people attractive in my life until that point, so it was a little hard to fight against it. However, being in a relationship, I really had to tell myself that it wasn't okay to feel that way because my future was with my partner and I didn't want to ruin it. We also were experiencing some rough patches at the same time (hardly spent any time together, I felt more and more alone), so that also contributed to how the whole thing went the way it did. My relationship has actually gotten better since I opened up to my partner about it. There was a time he was really mad at me, felt deceived after I had told him, but he understood where I was coming from and decided to work on himself to help the relationship become more stable. I really respect him for that."

"I don’t mind girls (or women or ladies or most other equivalent terms) in casual conversations. In a professional setting, i wouldn’t bat an eye at something like “hey girls, Jessica’s baby shower will be at lunch on Thursday!” 

If someone in a professional relationship or in some other dynamics, addressed me as girl, especially while making demands, that I have an issue with. For example, “girl, I love those shoes with that dress” is fine. “Girl, fetch me a coffee and vacuum the crumbs around my desk,” is not."
"“You’re a fat little man”!” —to my cat. 
He is. He is a fat little man. "
"""Woman, fetch me a coffee and vacuum the crumbs around my desk.""


I don't think the main issue is woman or girl in that example."
"When I was in 4th grade, I had a crush on this boy and was too afraid to actually talk to him, so instead I spent my whole recess every day talking to my best friend about how cute that boy was. One day, my friend came up with this not-so-brilliant idea of how to show him I liked him. She said that she heard someone say that when a girl likes a boy, she'll ""swing around the pole"" for him. I spent the next several recesses literally swinging around poles, although it never ended up working. In retrospect, I now realize that I had been pole dancing for this guy, but as a 4th grader I had absolutely no idea what that meant."

"Wow you just made me realize that deep down I don't want children and probably shouldn't have any. I've always leaned towards no, *but* have dated a few guys who talked about having kids and I would always be confused because I could see myself being okay with it when they bring it up.

Your story made me realize I would be horrified if I had a child, but had to raise it by myself. I didn't want kids, I liked the idea of playing house with guys I loved and was attracted to. I probably don't *actually* want to be a mom if it all depends on if I'm married or not. I shouldn't bring a kid into the world if I wouldn't want to be a mom to them *in general,* not only during a certain fantasy or set of circumstances. 

I feel like the truly parental friends I have would choose being a single parent over never having any children at all before they die, and you just made me realize I'm the exact opposite and that I shouldn't bring a child into the world for any reason other than actually wanting to raise one. "

“On your left” excuse me 
"Technically the equivalent of ""guys"" is ""gals"". But I don't really like that. I would prefer to be called a woman."
I never had an emotional affair but I had met people that I was insanely attracted to on deeper level while being in a relationship. I acknowledged to myself that yeah I was attracted to that person but there're billions of people in this world. You'll bump into others who tickle your fancy more than your SO. I just don't do anything about it and probably stay aloof from those people not to get myself into any situation that will hurt my partner.
"Might as well share my own experience. 

My dad is far from perfect. But he was a good dad. We were so close growing up. He taught me so much about music, honestly like half of my music taste comes from him. One of my favorite memories was when I was in like sixth grade and we went to a Pink Floyd cover band. It was so much fun and I remember on the ride there he was trying to warn me that people might be smoking weed there, “you might smell weed, it’s the same smell that comes from our neighbors house, it’s not legal but it’s not going to hurt you so don’t freak out”😂 

He has always been there for me. I got pregnant when I was 19. When I told him, he started crying, hugged me which was weird because he never does, and immediately ran down the hall of his apartments happily announcing that he was going to be a grandparent. I wasn’t sure how he would react but I definitely did not expect that. Poor neighbors, I told him at like six in the morning lol. 

Unfortunately my daughter’s father became increasingly abusive throughout my pregnancy and it got really bad once she was born. Every time I expressed wanting to leave I would be physically attacked, I was afraid I was going to die. I was able to secretly let my dad know what was going on, he instantly came over, got my daughter and I the hell out of there and let us move in. Almost a year later and I’m finally stable enough to move into my own place, we move tomorrow. I appreciate my dad so much for all of this. I don’t know where I would be right now if it weren’t for him."

I broke up with an abusive ex husband, got him to move out, secured a restraining order and got sole ownership of our house.

Reconnected with my family and friends, from whom I'd been isolated by my abuser. 

Met someone new, fell in love and married him. Got a new last name. :)  Also, two ""new"" cats (his two moved in with my two, so now there are four).

Made new friends and got involved with hobbies that had always interested me.

"In high school I started bringing those Fiber One bars for breakfast. My crush never ate breakfast so I started giving him mine. 

Eventually I started bringing extras just for him. My mom couldn't understand why we were suddenly going through two boxes of fiber bars a week and would get super pissed at me about it, but it totally worked. We started dating within a few months of this.

We dated for eight years and I brought that guy breakfast every single day until we graduated. "

I created another account but I just follow close friends on it (I think I'm following 15 people?) and I don't post any photos on it.

"Start something.  Do something.  Doesn't have to be the thing you do forever, doesn't have to be part of a big strategic plan.  Get a job and work for a while.  Make sure you learn and get a track record of some easily transferable soft skills - getting along with people, being part of a team, being punctual, communicating, dealing with disappointment,  etc.  Get some stories you can tell in interviews about how you dealt with less than ideal situations at work in a professional manner.  

At the same time, make notes about things that tend to make a day a good one or a bad one - is it important to you to work with people you like, in an environment where you feel like you're valued, toward a mission you believe in, to get tangible success, etc?  Or is it all about having enough time and money to enjoy life outside of work?  Over time, make moves that get you more of those helpful things and less of things that leave you exhausted or in a bad mood.  

I didn't discover my career until I was in my 40s, and then I was working alongside people two decades younger for a few years to establish myself.  But it was based on those soft skills that I'd spent decades acquiring in other ways, in other industries.  I've discovered that I end up getting jobs apparently because I'm able to stay cheerful and relatively positive when things aren't going well, which I didn't even know was a job skill.  

You're not alone if you're having trouble figuring it out.  "
"I once was in a relationship with a substance abuser who eventually became abusive towards me. I had our lives planned out, and when he was sober things were good. I finally came to terms with the fact that I couldn’t help change someone, they could only change themselves. When he did (or so I thought) we tried again, and he relapsed again, thereafter the abuse started again. I’d never felt more let down in my entire life, not by him but by myself. I let myself be consumed by a dream and was essentially destroyed by that relationship, and I had to watch the life I thought we’d had together slip through my fingers. With the initial aftershock, I became stronger for it. I still suffer with mental degradation at times and it’s been years, doubting myself for not being good enough, but I had to learn in time that the fairytale was just an illusion I’d created for myself and this person I thought I loved, when in fact he didn’t exist at all. You should always reach for your dreams and goals, but don’t forget to be a realist. "

"A good guide is to avoid taking on the inappropriate behaviour yourself, just provide backup/support for the woman to deal with it how she wants to. 

Examples from my own experience, but I imagine it's also a good way to approach any situation where you have power and someone else doesn't and is being treated inappropriately:

Someone talking over me at work - the best reaction was my boss pretending he didn't hear the guy who spoke over me and just asked me to repeat what I said because he didn't catch it (rather than telling the guy to let me finish).

Getting hassled at a bar while waiting for my friend - a guy quietly asked me if I knew the guy bothering me and said I could come sit with him and his friends while I waited if I wanted to. I way prefer that to him confronting the guy on my behalf.

Someone drunk guy hitting on me on a train - a guy offered to swap seats with me.

Someone at work calling me a retro pet name - my colleague burst out laughing and said to me ""Do you want to tell him it's 2018 or shall I?""

The key to mascara for men is to use one that doesn’t thicken, only colors, and let it dry. Then use a Q tip to wipe off any boo boos from your lid. When your lashes dry use a dry spookiest brush to separate and lashes that clump. I also use chapstick.

I never wanted to have a kid. I don't like children. I was too far along (or so I thought at the time) when I found out I was pregnant that I couldn't get an abortion.

"Am I allowed to answer from the dad's point of view?

I love my kids very much and regret is probably too strong of a word, but I do regret having them in my early to mid twenties, which has denied me alot of things I wish I had done in my life.

I regret that I have to stay more or less tied to my ex when it would really be healthier for us to make a clean break. We're getting a divorce and it is actually quite amicable, but I think we both kinda wish we could say our goodbyes and move on from one another.

I dislike the city I live in for my kids. We moved here for my ex-ish wife to be near her family. I don't care for it and if not for our kids I would be gone before the ink dried on the divorce papers. But we have kids together. I am not okay with leaving my kids and going away without them. I'm not going to try and take the kids with me and deny them their mother. Mom will never leave this city. So the only solution is to stay here and suck it up, at least until they are old enough to travel by themselves.

On the positive side though; 50/50 shared custody is possibly the best thing to happen to mom and I'm parenting. The kids spend a week with me and a week with their mom. Having that week off from being a dad, when I can go and destress and have a drink with coworkers or go on a long motorcycle ride or whatever makes my week of having my kids *so much* easier. No matter how rough parenting gets, you always know some alone time is just a few days away. And mom and I get along well enough to tweak if one of us has something come up during our time with the kids and we don't mind taking the kids an extra night.

"I was really in love with the guy I was dating (we'd been close friends for about 5 yrs before becoming a couple) and we thought we would move overseas and change the world together. And then he came out to me. So, of course, we split up and I was down a boyfriend and a best friend, too, and was very depressed for quite a while, probably a year. I didn't know what to do with myself. 

And finally I figured out, that was exactly it. I had always pinned my future plans and dreams on having someone else around. And while that may not be a problem for others, for me, it was a huge barrier to moving forward and having a meaningful life as my own person. So I let go of the dream of being with someone -- not saying, I won't, but rather, I might but that's not the major goal of my life. I applied, and was accepted to, my top two choices for my Master's. I learned to enjoy myself and spend quality time with myself. I started working out a little more. I got to know myself and tried to appreciate the things I like about me. 

Later I did meet someone else, and get married. But, I have been very careful from the beginning to keep a firm picture of who I am and what I want to do, myself. I still spend time with just myself. I am still my own person, my goals and dreams -- while I talk about them with him -- aren't predicated on my spouse. I stand on my own two feet, next to him, rather than on his, clinging to him. And it's hard work, sometimes, but it is worth it for my own self-respect. "

They'll let you know by calling out your order before you say anything, or asking if you want your usual order, etc.  You don't get to just declare yourself a regular on the 3rd day in a row that you come in when you haven't even met all the employees yet.

"I thought I was a killer dancer and my crush told me he was going to this random middle school dance at our school. It wasn't even an event you dressed up for. You just showed up in what you wore all day to classes. I found him at the dance and was thrilled when he asked me to the floor. I was throwing out some of my best moves (the worst moves ever, it turns out) including some classic Running Man and The Roger Rabbit. I realized abruptly that we were the only ones dancing and that those surrounding us were not cheering us on like in the movies, but pointing at me and laughing. He was watching me like one might watch someone doing the Running Man and The Roger Rabbit as a serious dance. I ran crying from the floor.

Even my older brother was there to witness the whole thing. He shared with the family. It became a fun story at the dinner table for years to come.

"God. So many examples of infinite lameness to choose from, how to post only one? Well, here's today's embarrassing story:

I was a sheltered 14-15 year old with a part-time job at a fast food restaurant and had a massive crush on one of the juvenile delinquents I worked with. I got it in my head that he'd like me more if he could see what I looked like ""outside of the uniform."" (Spoiler alert: I looked 11 with 80s hair, like the youngest kid on Full House. I was a late bloomer.)

So after I got off shift, I'd spend like an hour in the breakroom ""getting ready to go out"" - changing into outfits and full-on re-curling my hair and reapplying my makeup to its full, 80s Aquanet/Wet n'Wild glory. The reality was that my parents were going to come pick me up and I'd be going straight home to stare at the walls. That hour was spent just so I'd impress him with my rejuvenated beauty during the 30 seconds it took for me to walk back up to the front and out the door to their minivan. Assuming he even noticed I left, which he generally didn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think he did end up calling me on the phone a few times but nothing came of it.

"Here's some excellent advice about crushes in relationships I have saved, from another Redditor (I can't find the original comment to credit him.  


&gt;Reddit tends to have a black &amp; white view of cheating that I find naive. Crushes tend to walk the line of emotional cheating, but honestly I think they happen in even the most healthy relationships, and as long as you both want to work through them, they are worth working through.  
&gt;  
&gt;My wife and I have dealt with crushes several times over our 10 years together. Once for me, and twice for her. I swear, if I asked reddit for help during the times she had crushes, cuz it was shitty times, it would have told me to walk away with a couple hundred upvotes, and that would have been the absolute worst advice. We've been married two years now (though we've been devoted to each other for ten years) and could not be happier. Each time has been a chance to make both ourselves and our relationship stronger. So, I decided to share our success with reddit to maybe help other relationships. Obviously you should leave a relationship that is not healthy, but I don't think you should throw away a relationship. (Note: The crushes all happened before we were married).  
&gt;  
&gt;What are crushes? Crushes are accidental feelings someone has for another person (i.e. not their partner). This is different from people who seek out relationships via Tinder, etc. Usually they are with a coworker or classmate, because these are people they bump into a lot. They develop a friendship, and either over time or sometimes quite suddenly, they feel they ""hit it off."" They might feel the infatuation so strongly, it's like they are in love again. They probably feel confused and incredibly guilty because they love their partner so much, how could they feel such strong emotions for another person? And for you, it must feel like a huge breach of trust. You gave them their heart, how could they?  
&gt;  
&gt;I think it happens by accident, and it's normal, and it's hard as shit, but as long as you both truly love each other and truly want to get past it, you can. And your relationship will be that much stronger if you do.  
&gt;  
&gt;What are the right conditions for a crush to occur? Crushes happen when there's a perfect storm of variables: EDIT: I got some feedback on this so I'd like to change it. Crushes can happen at any time in a relationship for a various reasons, though I think the most pervasive crushes occur when there is a perfect storm of variables:  
&gt;  
&gt;The relationship is strained Every relationship goes through hard times. There are ups, and there are downs, and crushes tend to happen when there are downs.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. You or your partner's life is strained outside the relationship. Maybe money is tight. Maybe work is in overdrive. Family is sick. Life really sucks sometimes, and it can make us stressed, which can transfer into our relationship. We are more tense, and show our love less. We might still feel it, it's just harder to show because we're constantly stressed about other things.  
&gt;  
&gt;3. The partner is at work/school more than at home awake. This one is pretty much all the time. We'll be at work or in class more hours in the day than we are at home with our partner. Then he is accidentally spending more time with a coworker or classmate than he is at home. Maybe they share an office, maybe they are in all the same classes. He's not trying to seek her out, they just happen to be in the same place most of the day/week.  
&gt;  
&gt;4. The crush represents what you are dissatisfied in with your partner This might be kind of a cold way to think about it, but relationships can be thought of in terms of Pros &amp; Cons. For example, my wife is not into sci-fi like I am, but this classmate did. We bonded over our favorite Star Trek series, and before I knew it I had a crush. In reality, my wife has a hundred more ""pros"" than this crush, but this crush had a pro where my wife had a con.  
&gt;  
&gt;So, your partner has a crush... What now? Like I said, my wife and I have dealt with this several times over our relationship, and each time we've set ground rules, and each time we've come out stronger and more in love than before.  
&gt;  
&gt;Keep open and honest communication at all times, and work through it TOGETHER. Don't hide your feelings from your partner, even if you want to protect the other person. You might not want to talk about it, wether you have the crush or they do, but you HAVE to communicate. You HAVE to know what your partner is going through at all times. Work through it together, and you'll come out together.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. Don't be alone with your crush (like never meet up for coffee), because while she can't avoid working with him, she can avoid seeing him other outside of work. Meeting up like that is a chance at taking intimacy to a deeper level. You might want her to cut off ties to him entirely, but often that's next to impossible to implement. Think of this like a ""soft"" cutting off ties. Think about it, you have your ""work friends,"" and then you have your ""friends you hang out with."" It puts a barrier there.  
&gt;  
&gt;3. Never complain or joke about your partner to your crush Even the most innocent joke can indicate you are not happy with your relationship.  
&gt;  
&gt;4. Spend more quality time together. These crushes happen in part because we are at work/school more than we are awake at home. So, overcompensate a little. Turn off the TV, get off facebook &amp; reddit, and play board games or go for walks. I always think the free dates are more intimate than going out to dinner &amp; drinks, because that can feel like throwing money at your relationship, but those can be fun, too.  
&gt;  
&gt;5. Don't give ultimatums!! This is a very common tactic in these situations, and I think it only does harm to the relationship. It might seem like a good test of their devotion to you, but when you are emotional (which you definitely will be if you are going through this), please consider you might not be setting a reasonable ultimatum. More importantly, giving any ultimatum (however reasonable) tells your partner that you value your needs over your relationship. Even more importantly, giving an ultimatum forces them to work on the problem on their own, voiding the chance to work together, which is in violation of rule #1 above and makes it 10x harder to resolve. It says to them, ""I give up, it's your problem... fix it or it's over."" My parents got married on an ultimatum, so believe me when I tell you it doesn't work the way you think it should. I'm glad they got married and all because I exist and all, but that shit never got resolved.  
&gt;  
&gt;Giving an ultimatum ends the relationship, no matter what your partner chooses. However, in the end, if your partner has a crush, maybe it's not worth it for you to work through their crush. It's a really hard process, and maybe you're not up to the challenge. Maybe you really do value your own needs over this relationship, and wouldn't mind breaking up, which is why you might be tempted to give an ultimatum. But let's be real, that's not because of their crush, or anything they did, it's because you don't value the relationship enough to keep working at it when things get tough. And maybe you shouldn't value it, maybe it's a bad relationship and you should give it up, but just be honest about why you're giving up, (and don't give an ultimatum).  
&gt;  
&gt;These above rules are really simple, and are relatively easy to implement. It's the emotional turmoil the whole thing puts on your relationship that is hard. Obviously, you need to set your own rules between you and your partner, I'm just sharing what's worked for us. I hope this helps you if you ever find yourself in one of these not fun situations.  
&gt;  
&gt;With the first crush, we set these ground rules together, and we've stuck to them, and they've all passed over. We were able to figure out the issues in our own relationships that contributed to crush happening in the first place, and so our relationship is that much stronger."
"My mother moved from korea to the states. She told me she was lonely, had identity issues, and then she had me and it seemed like her problems were fixed. She invested almost all her time and energy to me. She told me that I gave her meaning to life. 

Ironically, i got married and moved to korea. I felt the same thing my mother went through. I believed that having a baby would fix everything (give me purpose, keep me busy, etc), and of course it didn’t. I was never even a ‘baby person’ to begin with, so parenting was even more difficult for me. 

I have two boys now and I love them so much, but I am definitely done having kids. I dont think I was “born to be a mother” like some other women are. I try my best to be the mother they need, and I think thats all that matters. Buuut I still go through these periods where I become very depressed thinking about where I would have been if I never had children... what if I did finish school and pursued a career for myself. I know its not too late to do all of that, but it’s just so much harder when I need to care for my family as well. "
"My Elementary crush loved tuna and would bring his own lunch, most of the time it was tuna with crackers. (Duh)

So, I started bringing my own lunch, it was tuna with crackers. Mhm... we actually became good friends, we always had the same homeroom teacher and they would assign us to sit next to each other. Bless.

Funny thing is I hate tuna, I kept this going all the way from Kindergarten to 5th grade.

"Domestic labor imbalance.


I'm both very type A (I want things done my way, on my schedule) and I'm the type who shows love by acts of service.


So in the beginning it seemed very natural for me to take on the cooking, cleaning, laundry, shopping, etc. It both was a demonstration of affection and simply more efficient for me to do it my way instead of trying to make someone else do it my way.


If I had just acted as though of course I naturally expect him to do half the work from the very beginning, that dynamic would have been set. He wouldn't have minded - he would have done it. 


But now we're five years in to a dynamic that's very difficult to change and emotionally charged and ripe for resentment on both ends and I'm trying to radically change the status quo and it's not going so well. "
"I knew he was a huge redditor and I was on the bus diagonally in front of him trying to position my screen just right so he’d see my screen from the crack between the seats. God I’m lame lmfao

BUT it actually worked. Tapped me on the shoulder and asked what I like to browse on reddit. One thing led to another and we dated for several months. Dumped him when I started to realize he was kinda racist and sexist. OOF. "
"Keeping a beautiful home. From a salt water fish tank to a vegetable garden. Maybe even some chickens. I'd spend my life organising, creating, cleaning, my hands in the soil, enjoying my slice of heaven. "
So What. What a rager. What an era.
"I don’t regret having my son—he’s the light of my life—but I do regret that I’m tied here to this shitty town and job and ex-husband until he’s 18. Only 5 more years to go, though!"
I love that even though I don't quite understand it 
I did something similar I was really into pop punk in hs and I was from a small town and didn't know anyone else who liked it but one day this new kid moved to town and he had the whole punk look about him and a slipknot drawstring backpack so I started listening to slipknot so we'd have something in common and then I was to nervous to talk to him so I would listen to slipknot on my phone so loudly that you could hear it even with the ear buds in my ears (bad idea folks) and he never noticed and now I'm partially deaf. 
"Same! I hate myself so much for it but I’m more often than not biting my tongue to wait for my turn to speak. And I sure as hell despise being interrupted or talked over. 

My SO and I struggle soooo much with this as we’re both the same. I’m sure all neighbors are tired of hearing the phrase “WOULD YOU LET ME TALK, PLEASE AND THANKS?!” Coming from our house 😂😂😂"

"Group of main characters go on an adventure and only one of them is a women.  She is the stereotypical Action Girl, who looks like a Twiggy-era supermodel, but somehow is able to beat 300 pound bad guys because girl power."
"Full disclosure, I don't think I was right to behave in the way I did. I had many instances of emotional cheating in my previous relationship. It happened frequently towards the end, as I had checked out of it because I was tired of being a mom-person to my boyfriend at the time rather than a partner/girlfriend-person. Part of it was also assuredly low self esteem. I still should have dumped him beforehand.

Now I am married to a different man and can't even imagine doing that to him, let alone in general. I still find other people attractive but I don't even want to flirt with them. "
"Doesn’t bother me, probably cause I hear and use boy just as much."
"Similar situation. I never bothered to find out if it was reciprocated by the other party I was interested in because that to me was crossing a line and dangerous territory I didn't want to get in. That person was also someone I worked with making it more difficult.

I tried to treat the whole situation as a giant warning sign that my relationship (and myself) weren't what I wanted and instead of running off to someone else that I should work on the things I'm unhappy with. I spoke to my SO about the things I was unhappy with both, us as a couple and myself as a person. We worked through that rough patch and conveniently I was switched teams at work that same month. I still see that person from time to time but it's much easier to maintain distance.

We're going through a rough patch again but that's typical of most long term relationships. You get so caught up in life you have to remind yourself to make time for the relationship. I'm glad this was posted today, I'm going to do something nice for my SO today and put in some effort I feel I haven't been putting in lately."
"You know that thing where you're doing something that requires a fair amount of concentration – like writing an exam or composing an important mail that needs to be worded carefully or anything along those lines – and someone (like an invigilator in the exam hall or your colleague at work) stands over your shoulder and observes what you're doing either out of curiosity or for any specific purpose, causing you to become self-conscious and lose focus? I find it annoying when people do this, especially when they do it just out of plain curiosity. But I recently realized that I sometimes do it to others as well. "
"Rape as character development. It's bad enough when it's used to develop the victim's character, but when a woman is raped and it's effectively a McGuffin for some dude's revenge fantasy,  it takes every ounce of will not to start setting fire to things. "
"Props to your Man!!!

I too, became emotionally involved with someone who I was attracted too because of how smart and self driven they were. while going through a ‘rough patch’ with my SO. 
I lost a lot of sleep thinking about my feelings and knowing how wrong it was for me to think about someone other than my SO while laying next to him every night. 
When he saw a text from my crush he confronted me and I told him everything. He even spoke to my crush and asked if we had been physical and he confirmed that we never had. I never contacted my crush again and he never tried contacting me either. I still wake up thinking about him sometimes but I wanted my son to be raised in a two parent home. 
Long story short, my SO was not man enough to handle the situation. Instead he called me degrading names and told me I would have to pay for “what I did to him” for the rest of my life! We have a son together so I sucked it up for more than a year but this last Valentine’s Day when I came home from work and the first thing that came out of his mouth was “why do you have so much make up on?, who are you trying to look pretty for?!” I realized that I would be better off alone. I left this man and we are currently Co-parenting. Best decision I have ever made!

"I speak for myself and most of my friends that are also moms with this comment. But a lot of the regret people hear about or suspect isn't completely directed at having kids specifically, but all the other changes that come with becoming a mother.

I will also note that I'm one of those women that didn't know I was pregnant for a while, so I didn't have much time to prepare or really think about anything.

But one big shock was how my boyfriend who had respected me for working 2+ full time jobs and being a total workaholic switched to thinking I was totally happy to stay at home and not go back to work. He also seemed to think I was naturally some domestic goddess that could cook and clean and stay on top of everything.... But really, prior to going on leave/giving birth I had never really cooked at home or kept my house clean... Because I was never home and always on the go! Giving birth did not suddenly grant me the knowledge of all these things mothers are apparently supposed to know.

That leads into the next thing, which was daycare. There was no daycare. They exist, sure, but the waiting lists are YEARS long so if you didn't apply before you even got pregnant, you're shit out of luck. So if you're like me and LOVE working, you feel pretty fucked over. 

So there I was with a 18 month old, maternity leave was up (which paid $800 a month, yay), no daycare, and a boyfriend that totally did not understand why I wasn't thrilled to stay home with a baby, never have to go anywhere or make my own money.

And then there was society in general shitting on me for not appreciating my own personal hell of isolation? Like how dare I, as a woman, not enjoy being a prisoner of my own home and a personal maid?

And then when I did manage to be able to get back to work, it was the opposite where I was apparently horrible for leaving at a daycare instead of ""raising him myself"". 

Basically, I was expected to apparently just not be a person anymore and instead be a mom.... And that's it. I love my son but I also love myself and having my own goals and shit going on. All of this I mentioned plus more makes me have some regrets, but there's really no preparation I could have done anyway. 

Also my son is 5 now and I managed to go to school quite recently and I just finished, so everything is improving. "

"[long, I'm Sorry]

 I was a singer. A damn good one too. I loved it, I breathed, ate and dreamed music. It was around me, everywhere and I have never been happier. I played guitar and piano, I had very good hearing so I could pick up any instrument, give it 30 seconds tops and I'd play you a song. I was in theatre, choirs, every single school performance. If I didn't apply it didn't matter, the teachers headhunted me anyways and it became so regular that I just stopped applying all together and they would just come get me for practice. I was regularly bullied, but even the bullies came over and asked me to sing from time to time. I even ended up having huge circles of people around me in recess to listen and come with suggestions, and my guts inspired other singers too so they joined me and we jammed regularly. I even sang on the bus (I was very consumed by the joy of singing and blinded of others I know but that's not the point) and sometimes even the bus driver was like ""hey! The singing girl! Have you learnt a new song?"", And I sang in every single parking garage and people would stop with their cars to listen or roll down their windows and come up to me after parking and said it sounded nice etc. I straight up felt like a superstar, and I knew I was destined to be one. Everyone around me expected the same. 

Then, I got bronchitis right before the premiere of a show we had with my theatre. 13 years old at the time. I had a very big role (were talking 5 minute monologue with some musical additions and whatnot) and I couldn't tap out and make the other girl in the other group do it, because that'd mean she had to do 50 shows instead of her 25.,(we had 25 each) and my mother pulled the ""you have to start what you've finished, it isn't That bad"" card. And therefore I just had to do it. I was coughing and sniffling my way through it, almost passing out between each time on stage. I was fed sugar cubes drenched with ethanol to just get through it, it was horrible. But I did it. I was so proud. I had actually done 25 shows with heavy bronchitis and I felt even more like a superstar. ""nothings gonna stand in my way"" I thought. 

But then I never got better... I got hoarse, my throat didn't feel the same, I started sliding out of my notes that I'd easily hold without effort earlier.  When I wanted to hit a note it started to become a 50/50 thing whether I actually hit it or not,, because my muscle memory was... Off. I couldn't even sing a full song anymore without my throat getting so dry I couldn't breathe properly. And I didn't know why. 
I went to the doctor and explained my issues and we found out I had gotten 2 nodules, one on each vocal chord, during my bronchitis performances. I was shattered. Completely utterly destroyed. ""my life is over"" was the first thing I thought and I got the biggest identity crisis I think I'll ever have. My entire life, not just my hobby but my driving force in life was just gone. I was told that it is possible to train it away, so I tried but to no success. Not quick enough for my psyche to catch up at least. So I gave up. I accepted that ""I've had my turn. I'll apparently never sing again. I have to accept that."" and so I did. 
I stopped singing. Stopped playing guitar. Eventually stopped playing piano. I even stopped listening to music all together because hearing others being able to use their voice just made me cry. I stopped going to concerts. I stopped dancing. I was dancing to get better stamina while I was singing anyways so I was prepared for big shoes one day. That wasn't happening, so I quit. 
I went from being ""the girl who always sings with a contagious smile, brightening everyone's day"" to being ""the depressed emo girl people wanna stay away from cause she's a bummer and just wants to die"". 
Not gonna lie, it was pretty bad, even dramatic, how much the nodules impacted me. 

Fast forward to when I moved out with my boyfriend at 16. After living together for a few months a friend suggested we all love into a collective. (dormitory?)
So we did. 2 couples and 2 singles, all friends. We lived there for a year, and the boy in the other couple knew me from my musical times. We had jammed countless times and were constantly in awe of eachother and gave eachother challenges and new things to learn. When he realized how far away I had become from music, he started pushing it a bit, trying to make me sing. Eventually his girlfriend managed to make me say yes to playing a singstar-like game (don't remember but you download the songs yourself) and we started shyly playing it a little bit. After about 6 months of that I finally ended up managing to belt for the first time in years. Sometimes I even lasted a full song without needing a glass of water immediately/throughout the song. I started trying to become friends with my throat again and **instead of focusing on what I can't do I started focusing on what I can do. ** Personally I didn't feel like it made a big difference at first. I was happy to sing, but I didn't realize how happy it actually made me until my boyfriend looked over at me almost with tears in his eyes saying ""you're humming again."" 
I hadn't been humming for years. Thats when I realized that I might be ready to start flirting with music again. I started singing more, I started instigating the singstar sessions - didn't need to be talked into it anymore - I started singing karaoke by myself which I hadn't done in years as it just made me pissed.  Eventually I started daring myself to post some singing videos here and there, because I'm a perfectionist. But I don't like to be. So I started slowly but surely letting people back in and slowly but surely started to let myself back out and after posting some covers here and there I even wrote my first song in years! 

https://www.instagram.com/desiiplays/p/Ba6uZSgHEzj/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=x0j94d1m2e2r

This one is very mellow and you can hear that it's not exactly a happy song. I was still in a period where depression got the best of me and this was my attempt at sharing some of my feelings through music for the first time in ages. 

I ended up posting a tiny bit more music, just a little here and there nothing too fancy. And then Billie Eilish posted a tiny second of my cover in her new years video! That's when I kinda decided for myself that I'm not going to let my internal worries stop me from doing what I love because I'm scared others will think I'm bad,Not as good as I used to be, etc. 
A while after that song was made I made my second song in years! This time a happier song. 

(this will psobably only play on mobile since it's igtv)

This time, I think you can see how much more comfortable I've become again, how my mood is completely different and the subject matter went from assault to looking up in the sky with my head held high. This transformation was mostly possible because I found music again. 
I'm still trying to post here and there but I'm trying not to make myself panic by making it too much of a ""thing"" yet. Right now I'm just enjoying myself and enjoying the challenge of daring to put myself out there a little more, and even though I'm not back to where I used to be and my nodules are still there, I'd say I've bounced back mentally and it's thoroughly liberating. And I gotta say, just typing it out and reminding myself of how far I've come was also very liberating. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share my story💕

"That's my issue with it. This week, a coworker referred to me as ""the girl who does your calculations,"" but then also referred to a male coworker as ""the gentleman who previously handled your plan"" while she was on a client call.  

It gets on my nerves. I'm the same age as the guy, both 32. Why am I a girl and he's a gentleman? I'd never say anything about it to her, though. "

Any advice for a young man who feels.. stuck on how to start a career path?
This is what I do as well. I don't even feel the need to mention it to my partner. I would never betray him and it's simply unnecessary to hurt his feelings by telling him that I found someone else attractive when I won't do anything about it.
"I deleted Twitter because I was tired of watchig people try to have political debates in 240 characters. I felt like as a platform it was much more negative than positive. 

I deleted Instagram because I didn't want to spend time scrolling through curated half true highlights of people's lives. I knew in my head that it's not real life, but seeing a feed full of it all day long took a real toll on my opinion of my own life. 

Since deleting I feel less distracted on a daily basis. When I'm doing something fun or experiencing something cool I don't feel the pressure to take the perfect photo, I feel like I can just enjoy the moment. I've also stopped comparing myself to others as much, which has had a great positive impact on my mental health. "
"AND it's always years later. Never when it would have made sense. The number of times this happens is absurd. I fucking hate that.

If you like someone romantically, tell them. Dont wait years. Maybe they like you too. Maybe they just want friends. But waiting years and then we find out you have been harbouring some secret crush the whole time, while we thought you were a platonic friend really can freak a girl out. "
"Was making smoothies three days a week and had so much free time. I could do all those things people wish; play guitar, write poems, go for long walks with my dog, keep my house clean, read, draw, do art projects.

The job was pretty fun but had obvious customer service shitty moments. The pay was also bad, but I made just enough to get by and had fun being frugal. 

I decided I was too old now to have such a job, so I went back to school to get a career. I got really burnt out a year in, got very very sick, stress and sleep deprivation made it worse, now have long term health complications, anxiety, depressions, and student loans."
"I’m in the process of starting over — changing careers and going back to school in the fall. I put it off for ten years because of practical reasons... I was in a high-paying, soul-sucking corporate job and felt like I needed to be responsible and make it work. I gave up on my dream for a long time, but finally decided to take the leap. I’m super stressed and scared and excited and I don’t know how it will turn out, but I do know that I feel like I’m really living my life according to my values and dreams for the first time in years... maybe ever. I’m hoping it turns out to be the right decision."
Yikes! That must have been soul crushing.

"Not yet, just due to a lack of coordination. I'm still down, I should mention it next time I see him."
"I actually really like ""on your left."" 

Personally,  I wouldn't like ""excuse me"" flat out. It usually reminds me of people who unwelcomingly asking for my attention, which would scare me if I'm alone or at night. Anything like ""pardon me, passing through"" is perfectly fine. "
"It does get better as they get older. I am married and the primary parent because my husband works extremely long hours (and earns three times what I do). The day my son became old enough to be home alone even just for an hour or two was like a whole new world opened for me, and he was very much planned for and wanted."

"I had a difficult time when my children were small, too. I am not cut out to be a SAHM. 

It does get better when they start school, but I'd urge you not to wait. Find a parent's day out program through a day care center or a church. Get at least one afternoon where you can feel like a real person. "
"It was bad.

The level of neglect was absolutely unforgivable. The kicker was that people were *falling over themselves* to praise him for being a single dad and say ""there's so few men who would do that"". Mother fucker spent 18+ hours a day on the computer. Every day. The school called CPS and put us in therapy, and he blew the fuck up when he found out and refused to let us get any help. He told us repeatedly that men are incapable of raising children on their own (and also refused my mother custody when she eventually came back for us).

We never learned to communicate our emotions, solve problems in relationships, work out disagreements, or talk about anything that bothered us.

My brother killed himself a few years ago. My dad convinced himself that there's a government conspiracy that's sole purpose is to off young, straight, white men.

I don't talk to him anymore more, and I don't let my son talk to him. I really miss my brother."

"I (29 F) deleted social media after discovering I was spending over 10 hours per day on my phone. 

I feel it’s forced me to be in the moment when I’m out and has given me a lot of mental clarity.

Shut her up by kissing her.
"My mom died when I was 11, and my dad tried his best. He's always had a short temper and we did not get along at all for about 7 or 8 years there. He was underequipped and out of his element, but also knew when and who to ask for help, so it could have been worse. We are definitely a lot closer now, and while he's still a short tempered SOB frequently, he's getting better.

I did have to kind of grow up real quick and help take care of my younger sister, because my older sister got kicked out of the house when she turned 18, maybe 8 months after my mom died. She was partying a lot, and being generally ""disrespectful"" according to my dad, and he just couldn't handle her. I think this stress made me and my younger sister try to be extra easy in high school, we got good grades, didn't drink/do drugs, didn't get into trouble, etc.

I love him very much, he worries me a lot (poor diet due to depression, alcoholic, smoker, etc.) but he's hysterical and a great dad now, and I wouldn't change him for the world."
"&gt; It’s totally doable.

I know you're trying to be nice and all but this is really a naive and potentially aggravating thing to say to a stranger on the Internet. You've no idea what her reality is beyond what she's told you, and what she's told you does not give you any indication at *all* that ""it's totally doable."""
Logging in and out of MSN hoping they’d start a conversation. Sad cringe. 
I would get insanely educated. Stay a lifelong student and get degree after degree. I'd purposefully take intermittent semesters where my classes were online so I could do homework from all the cruises and vacations I would take.

"As someone who was repeatedly asked out as a joke in middle school and high school, I always assume that people I think are showing interest are just being friendly. I have to have someone ask me out and make plans right then and there and I'll still be suspicious of their intentions. 

It's the one area I am still lacking self-confidence in, that someone could be genuinely interested in me beyond the most shallow attraction based on looking for sex. But that's why my therapist gets paid the big bucks. "

"Thank you. I hope I didn’t scare you away from kids. I do absolutely love mine, but it is a life long commitment. It is a crazy amount of selflessness. And there’s absolutely nothing wrong with not wanting kids. Everyone has a different plan, a different purpose. I commend you for being honest with yourself! "
"I can relate to you very well.  I have two daughters that I love deeply. And because I love them so much is also why I feel guilty of my feelings of regret. I can’t bare to think of this life without them yet given the choice I would go back in a second to the past, and choose to not have kids. They seem like contradictory feelings but both live within me. 

Right at the end of my first pregnancy I stopped working. I stayed home to take care of the first, then the second....and between one thing and another I never went back to work. My first daughter was diagnosed with autism, not Aspergers, so to this day she’s 10 years old and still non-verbal. I suppose we still have been very lucky because despite everything she’s pretty functional and sociable, but will probably always be dependent in some level.

We live well since my husband has a great career. But I gave up mine. I feel like I threw my B.A. in Economics out the window. It’s been 11 years. Even if I found a good after school program for my girls, which is pretty much non-existent for my oldest. I’m completely daunted by the idea of finding a job in my field, I’m light years behind. So here I am, barely spending any money on me because I feel terribly guilty about it since I’m not the one working for it.

I crave having some life of my own. Some real time for myself. Some income of my own to treat myself without guilt.  I desire to travel and be able to go out until 3 am if I like. To have a reason to dress up and not be a mom. I look pretty much the same as before I had my girls. I know I can dress sexy and look great, have my husband see me as his wife, not just the mom of his kids. I’m only 38 and honestly don’t feel any different than when I was 26 and dating him. But it’s so difficult to break away from parent mode. 

I often don’t even recognize who I am. I feel like I lost the real me in a sea of chores and endless routine. Don’t really have anything to look forward to. My husband is great and helps me a lot, we get along pretty well. Yet I still feel lonely and like he doesn’t really know the true me. We have a good marriage but I still think of getting divorce just so that I can have half the week with no kids and be myself. It’s a silly idea I know, yet I daydream about it sometimes.

I’m afraid this is all my life is going to be like. My only true happiness only existing in my daydreams. It is what it is I suppose.   :/"
"Can I (M) ask what you consider an emotional affair? If you follow AskMen and similar subs, you'll see a common theme of men not getting/giving the emotional support they need from/to other men. They often get it from women instead. That's my case, where two of the deepest friendships I have are with women, including one who was a FWB years ago. It's never bothered my wife (the time that I asked, her response was ""Are you sleeping with her? No? Then what do I care, she's a good friend to you."")

I guess just given my experience, I don't understand the idea of an emotional affair. Why would I be angry about my wife being happy connecting with someone? Life is too short and difficult to miss out on closeness with someone. It's a problem if the relationship is distracting from the promises you've made to your partner -- are you staying out with this other person when you're supposed to be home helping put the baby to bed, are you spending energy supporting the other person but not listening to your partner's challenges.

Maybe another way I can ask it is, when you have an S.O., do you think there's ""emotional exclusivity""? Because that happens a lot and men at least end up cut off from the emotional support they need -- they no longer have women they can ask for relationship advice, they end good friendships that were sources of support in crises, and they miss out on candid feedback from a female perspective."
One day when you’re having a drink. Make sure to dedicate one to give thanks that you two have a good co parenting relationship. A lot of people would kill to have one. Congrats bruh.

"I wanted to be a stand up comedian. I met someone who was pursuing that as well, and we did a few open mics. I was becoming known locally by the other comics and just getting into the whole scene when I got pregnant with my second child. I didn't feel comfortable doing comedy while pregnant, and got caught up in life. I was really depressed about it, but kept in touch with everyone and kept up my Twitter(small potatoes but it made me happy). I haven't done an open mic since, but still support other comedians coming up and follow my favorite famous ones, still. I can finally watch stand up without being super sad about what could have been. "

"I just told my sister in law this story yesterday. 

My dad has always been abusive, but there was a turning point, where my husband toddler son and I had to flee in the middle of the night to crash at my in laws. For our own health and safety we went no contact with my father. I've always been a Daddy's girl. It was incredibly difficult and tortuous but was the best for all of us. 

Not long after the incident, it was father's day. We went to my in-laws again. I was in a funk, even though I focused on appreciating my husband. My quiet, introverted father-in-law was giving me a quick hug goodbye. 

""You okay?""

""Yeah, it's just.... Dad things are hard. I don't have one."" I started tearing up.

"I would rather have someone say *something* rather than nothing. The concern about ""white knighting"" has more to do with someone needlessly defending a woman in the hopes of getting in their pants/recieving approval from them.

Here's a recent example. I was at my place playing DK Country with my roommates, one of my roommates had a work friend over. Every time I beat a level he'd mutter ""damn, gotta love a girl who plays video games"" or ""wow, another win. Hot"". I kept giving him weird looks/ignoring him, but my roommates were visibly uncomfortable and didn't say anything. When he went outside to smoke a cigarette, I asked my roommate if he was planning on telling his friend it was weird to keep commenting on my playing. After all, he invited the guy, we didn't know him. Next time he commented, he really ramped it up (""so sexy, damn, can't believe it"") and my roommate was like ""dude, cut it out. You're being super rude and I won't bring you around if you keep embarrassing me."" I thought that was a good response, just wish I didnt have to say something first. When people stay silent, they're subconsciously justifying the behavior and allowing it to continue."
"If someone passes me and they appear to be minding their own business I don't think much of it.  Obviously don't like run up to within a couple feet of the person or appear to be walking up to them.

"Another A cup chiming in. I used to joke if someone was staring at my chest, they're not looking *at* my boobs, they're looking *for* them.

I also will never forget my dearest friend, whom I love so much, looking at a pic of us and excitedly exclaiming - ""Hey! You look like you actually have *cleavage*!"" It made me laugh, because she was legit saying it as compliment. 

I did get to experience significant boobage one time in my life, right after the birth of my daughter - I ballooned up to a whole FULL B cup! lol! But I do recall when jogging up the stairs, I'd have to actually hold my boobs because they bounced and it hurt. I finally understood and empathized with my bigger chested sisters out there.

For the most part, I've made my peace with my small As. But I still wear pushup bras so I have a little bit of curves up top when I'm dressed. And still joke about the one magic trick I can do when taking my bra off - 'Now you see 'em - Now you don't!' "
"I think a lot of mother's feel this sense of identity loss. I truly believe it would be better for mother's if we had more of a community concept of raising kids and didn't feel so secluded from normal life when going through the hardest parts of raising young children.   
In fact, I have yet to meet a mother who doesn't feel some sense of loss of self after having kids. Mother's who adore having kids and wanted lots of them, even they tell me similar things. "
I could not care less about being called a girl or a woman or a lady for this reason. If someone respects you their tone and treatment of you will reflect it. If someone looks down on you it doesn't matter what they call you because it'll still sound derogatory. Depending on your tone of voice you can make even someone's name sound like praise or an insult.

I always prioritize love over everything. And I always felt guilty about it. People said “stop relying on other people to make you happy, stop thinking you need love” etc etc. I understand what they’re saying. But after my friend said that above to me, it all made sense. I’ll drop everything I’m doing and follow my boyfriend to the ends of the earth. And it’s okay, because I love him, I love what he does, I love his dreams. I’m passionate about people and as long as I’m not killing myself over it it’s totally fine. That made me feel a lot better "

Potential Breakup Song by Aly &amp; AJ is a banger!! 
"Always the actors, sometimes the characters.  What's most egregious is that teenage or college-aged characters (of any gender) are generally played by actors well into their twenties, and it shows.   Which often means that in a movie/show that includes a nuclear family, regardless of the stated age of the characters, we can see that Dad is 50 while Mom is 30 and Kid is 25.  A famous example is in Mean Girls, where Amy Poehler (31 at the time, playing a woman clearly supposed to be in her late 40s if not older) played a character who was mother to Rachel McAdams (24 playing a 16 year old) and wife to Dan Willmott (whose age I can't verify, but I can tell you he was not 31 at the time Mean Girls was filmed).  

Which I kind of think is worse than the characters having the age gap.  If the male character is supposed to be 50 and is played by a 50 year old, and the female character is supposed to be 25 and is played by a 25 year old, well, that makes sense.  It still promotes "
"This started off so cute, then took a very sharp turn"
"Near the beginning of my 30s, I moved to the United States to be with my then husband. He ended up being an abusive, manipulative person and I got stuck for almost five years. Completely financially and emotionally independent on him and away from everything and everyone I knew back home in Canada. 

At 33, I decided I couldn't contemplate wasting anymore years of my life with this man that I didn't even love, and I packed up what little I had and moved home. Moving back in with my parents in my 30s was... humbling, I guess, and not something I was proud of but I was at least proud of leaving a toxic situation. It felt good to be home with the people I love. 

So I got a job, saved up my money, moved into my own apartment. Started my life over. Contemplated what I wanted out of my life, tried my best to deal with the trauma that my ex had inflicted on me while also struggling to come to terms with my sexuality that I'd been questioning for so long. Met the love of my life, a woman, am in the most stable relationship I've ever been in. I have found my soulmate, and everything has clicked into place. Life isn't perfect, but it's a million times better than I ever thought it could be a handful of years ago. 

Starting over was the best thing I ever did. "

"My mother died of cancer when I was eleven, and my brother went off to university so it was just me and Dad. At first it wasn't so bad, aside from the complete inability to speak of my mother or acknowledge our grief. It was lonely, and only got worse when his drinking started (far as I can tell he was always an alcoholic but my mother kept him sober.)

I moved away for a few years and ultimately moved back with him to finish high school. By then his drinking was worse and many nights were myself and my brother, who had moved home after university, being kept up by his screaming and rambling. He never hit us, but in a way that would have been easier to deal with than just being told you're a piece of shit constantly.

I ended up marrying the first guy who said he loved me, and that ended as well as you would expect. I just needed to get out. 

All the female stuff was absolutely awful to deal with, and I basically just shut that side down. I'm 41 now and only just finding that side. I miss my mother the most for that-figuring out what it meant to be female.

On a good note, my father did teach me that I could do anything, that I was stronger than I thought and to believe in myself. I've never doubted he loved me-he just didn't deal well. I learned to forgive him long ago and focused on being a great mother to my kids. 

"
"My parents didn’t divorce until right after I graduated high school, but I was raised alone by my father. My mom was/is a mentally ill alcoholic so losing her in 5th grade was more of an ambiguous loss. She was not involved whatsoever in parenting me. 

My dad owned his own construction company and came home and cooked us dinner every night. He took me to activities, went to my parent-teacher conferences, and brought my forgotten lunches to school. I could’ve used more affection growing up, but I know he tried his damndest. 

I’m about to graduate college and as a final project, we have to write/create our own children’s book based on certain topics. I chose different types of families, and my dad’s a super hero in my book. It’ll be dedicated to him and he’ll receive it, published, on father’s day. Wish me luck!! "

Hey at least your personal cringey memory has a really unique 90’s flavor.
"If you have a hoodie on, pull it down, don't look like a creepy stalker. When you are walking up to pass her be distracted like you haven't really noticed her, be on your phone so you don't look like your are focused on her.

Once you pass her do not look back. Ever. Just don't. Walk quickly away. Repeat, don't look back."
"I want to preface this by stating that I absolutely love my child and will not ever regret her, as my child. 

But there are days I do regret the decision. Especially now going through a divorce and seeing how bad of a father my ex really is. On top of that, I feel like I completely suck as a mother and just fail at doing motherly things. I tend to disconnect and try to teach her to be more independent - more so she will do things on her own and just leave me alone.  I know she's only 5 and she is at the age where children are pre-wired to test every single button that you have....but sometimes I just want to run away from it all and go back to not having any responsibility over any human being. "

"As soon as I realised I had deep feelings for the other person, I told my partner right away. We discussed things for many months, and decided to invite said person into our relationship instead of breaking up.  


We've all been very happy for the past three years now."
Divorced an abusive ex. Quit a dead end job. Relocated for a better job and better company. Made new friends in the new city. Started some new hobbies. Met my current partner and fell in love. 
"My husband bent over his desk, concentrating on his work and his brow is furrowed. Then, he runs his hands through his hair in frustration and it stays messed up. "
"I'm very thankful for that. She's a good mom and a good lady, we just weren't good for each other."
"It bothers me when people say ""men and girls"" or ""men, what's the best compliment you ever got from a girl"". When those words are paired the connotation is very creepy.

Also bothers me to hear songs that refer to women as ""little girl""."
"I agree with this.  Make it about *you*, not her.  There's a huge difference between:

""Hey, dude, you're making her uncomfortable.""

and

""Hey, dude, you're making me uncomfortable.""

One takes away a woman's voice because *you're* insinuating how *she* feels.  The other redirects to you so that you're still supporting her without stepping in to speak for her."
"It felt like a tragedy when I was younger. A Russian roulette, really, where I'd either come out looking fantastic or unrecognisable. I love using [this](http://imgur.com/NTo56kB) example of photos that were taken a day or two apart in 2008. Classic. 

Every photo taken of me is a shocking delight for the senses. My mother often cannot recognise pictures of me.

But along the way I realised that.. it doesn't matter! It was just an overnight epiphany that, worst case scenario, I wow people in person.

Now.

I won't pretend I'm not fearful for my wedding photos one day.

But for now? Do your worst, friends and family. "
"I moved to a new country, fell in love with it and planned on finding a job there so I could stay longer. Well, work visas are a pain to arrange and so I had to move back home. It was heartbreaking to let go of something I had wanted so badly 

How did I bounce back? I found a job back home and dove right into it. Life isn't fair and sometimes things don't work out. I keep telling myself that everything happens for a reason. "
I always assumed “gal” was just an old mispronunciation of “girl” that turned into obscure slang over time

"1. i realised that people actually were affected by what i said, i was use to the idea where i had no power or influence. once my self esteem and sense of self worth went up i realised that i have an affect on the people around me so suddenly i had this responsibility to do right.

2. i realised that it didn't matter how correct or right i was, there was a bigger picture that needed to be respected. That is - it's still is a method of shaming others and humiliates them which affects their self esteem. We're all going to make mistakes, we don't need to get shamed and humiliated for it however we will need self esteem to make it through the ups and downs. so don't destroy the person's self esteem/self worth/confidence thorough shaming and humiliation.

"Sophmore year in hs my group of female friends started hanging out with a group of male friends. I had a huge crush on one of the guys. They drank and smoked weed, so when they offered it to us we went along with it like we did too. I did end up dating the guy but the whole relationship was getting drunk and/or stoned and making out on horse trails in our neighborhood every weekend. I was very anti drugs/drinking until then. "
"Hey, just so you know. Society says otherwise, but it’s perfectly okay to hate certain stages of development and do better with others. I personally enjoy the 2-3 age range. Infants and teenagers drive me insane. I know a very successful couple where the mom cannot stand any type of make believe play, but thrives on doing adult activities like piano playing and skiing. Her husband is great with Barbies. She’d rather claw her own eyes out. It’s okay. "
I appreciate you normalising it. 
So much this. I started to dislike my dad and mom. They are divorced and it was like a competition on who could comment on my picture first. My dad would say “papa’s baby!” And then my mom would say “that’s Anna’s sweet baby for sure.”  So annoying. Now I just text them both pics. 
Just because they are your first love doesn’t mean they are the right one.
"I had a MAJOR crush on this guy from 6-8th grade. He didn't really even want to know I existed so I made up a story that I was working on the yearbook and asked him for a picture. He fell for it and I took his picture on one of those ""print immediately"" little cameras that print out a mini polaroid type picture. Legit still have that picture in my memory box somewhere lol. "

"I was 8. There was a boy that my friend Jenny and I liked very much, so we would always compete to get him to notice us. I decided one day to wear my soccer uniform over a floor length, and quite honestly hideous pink dress. I literally stuffed it all inside of my white shorts (I’m sure that looked fantastic). He wasn’t even in my class; I was just banking on seeing him in the hallway going to recess, which is exactly what happened, and all he said was “Nice dress,” and ran out the doors to go push Jenny on the god damn swing set. 

I don’t know why I didn’t just commit to wearing the dress for the whole day. I think I was just going for the shock factor. "

I personally hate it when women are so often referred to as ladies in instances when one would never say “gentlemen” for men. Men and ladies? No! Men and women, please. That lady? No. That woman, please. Don’t act like women have to be treated as more special or delicate. Just let us be women."
I really want more details on this one.

"I don’t regret having my kids per se. But I do get where you’re coming from. I had my kids when I was fairly young (compared to how I wanted life to be) and people were expecting me to have them. So at 26 I got married and had 2kids. Fast forward 12years later, divorced from my kids’ father, I realized that I have no maternal instinct at all. I had a period when I resented having them but that went away already. It was a conscious effort to change my perspective. I draw strength from my kids now. But sometimes I can’t help but wonder what life would be like without them. I feel a wave of shame whenever I think of that but it is what it is."
"You've git one hell of a dad there. Seriously, that was an amazing read and I could feel the love towards him in every word.

Not to mention that your children will have an amazing grandfather!"

"I used to work at a coffee shop that was in a train station. I was really good, and *very* fast at the job for that reason.

I absolutely hated it when people would order a drink that required a timed element (for example it takes about 20 seconds to pull a double shot of espresso, or 15-20 seconds to blend a drink) and then ask me to ""hurry up"" before I even started making it because they were worried about missing their train. Odds are you have ordered a drink at a coffee shop at some point in your life and you know it is going to take me at least two minutes to hand you your beverage. Perhaps build that in to your commute time?"

"My best friend growing up was male. (During our ages 5-12.) We spent nearly every day together in the summers, and every night playing after homework was done. He moved away for junior high, and we drifted apart like kids do. We reconnected in college, and picked up conversation like we were never away. It was awesome! I told him when my college boyfriend and I got engaged, and his response was, ""Oh. I always thought we would get married."" We literally never had even a conversation about dating in the 18 years we had been besties. Never. Once."
"I got away from my abusive ex when he got arrested. I was 39. I ended up getting sick and losing everything including my career. So at 40 I was homeless with two kids and a cat. 
At 45 I own my own home. Built a great career and I’m doing okay. But it’s terrifying. I’m focused on getting rid of all of my debt now. I never want to go there again. And my health is very iffy. Every day is hard. What if I don’t have the energy to pull it off? "

"Yes and no.  I mean, I have a high libido and will choose sex over almost any other activity.  I still feel like a lot of society (and media) overplays the general importance of sex (gotta be having it!) and just how amazing it is (gotta do anything to get it!).  If my SO left me, I'd certainly miss that part of the relationship, but I'd survive."
"I did something similar. I knew the guy I had a crush on would walk past my locker when  my lunch ended, so I'd make sure I was there. 

One day time got away from me I just bolted to my locker and made it just in time. I was breathing pretty heavily and he just kinda chuckled a said hey. 

*Luckily* he also hung around the same people as I did. He also had just started dating someone, but a YEAR later, they split up, and I got my chance, Haha. He was my first ever boyfriend. He's a good dude :). "
I can identify so hard with this. Spending hours in front of the mirror getting one curl of hair just right in case my crush saw me. -Cringe-
Thats dedication right there.
I relate to the end of your story so much. My sons father (fiancé at the time) committed suicide when our son was 18 months old. every day I wonder why he would leave me to do everything on my own. Knowing what I know now I don’t think I would have gotten pregnant because I think it’s unfair to my son that he has to grow up without ever really knowing his dad. 
"I was 5 months pregnant when I learned of the pregnancy. I'd always  been told that once you are out of your first trimester, that it was too late for an abortion. Honestly, I was too ashamed of my body and afraid of judgement (anyone thinking ""omg who would have sex with that whale?"") to go to any professional until my parents learned of the pregnancy at 8.5 months and forced me to go for an ultrasound. I just planned to give birth and immediately give up the kid in a closed adoption without telling anyone (other than my sister since we were living together)."
"I have a huge ass (proportionally), and early 2000's low cut jeans could *not* cope.  My underwear was sticking out ALL the time and not in a good way and not on purpose.  I too had braces."
"Can I just say I'm amazed when employees remember me, no matter how much I go there. I used to get coffee once a week at school and the barista there at one point had my order ready before I said anything and I'm just ??? You see hundreds of people a day, I come here once a week, how do you remember this. "
"I like the first one. ""Excuse me,"" often ends up being a so-called ""conversation starter,"" but ""on your left"" would kick in my old waitressing instincts."
"Because I was having sex with my then-boyfriend (now husband) before marriage and I didn’t go to church to confess my premarital sex regularly like she did. Different guy every week, but confessed it every week to a priest. "
"I had to give up my dream of becoming an occupational therapist or a physical therapist because graduate school is not affordable. I had to choose between gaining my independence and working on myself or double (maybe triple) my student loan debt that is currently at $38,000. My mental health is in a horrible state right now and I can’t take on more school because I think the debt and stress would push me to suicide. 

So I think I’m going to do public health careers or clinical research when I finish my undergraduate degree in a few months. "
I'm so glad that you figured it out. Couple of my girl friends are being coerced to have kids by their loving partner. I feel so frustrated but ultimately it's their call so I'll be with them no matter what. Glad you can figure it out and stand up for yourself 😊

"I’m being totally freaking honest, I don’t regret him but find myself resenting him sometimes. I know, that’s bad. That’s totally on me and I’m working it, I show him a lot of love. I had him young (17), the only thing I was ever sure of was that I wanted my boyfriend (now husband) in my life forever. My aunt over heard me talking to my cousin at the time and therefore told the entire family. So I felt I couldn’t be the catholic girl who had an abortion. I come from a big crazy chaotic, codependent family and I just didn’t want kids. I was the oldest and it fell on me to care for them a lot, sometimes I think I used up all my ‘mothering’  on my siblings and now have to force myself to put a mom face on. I love my son and my husband was on board with him being our only, thankfully. I love other people’s children, having more kids just isn’t for me. "
"&gt; I shouldn't have children if I wouldn't want them anymore after becoming a single parent.

very wise realization. at the end of the day, being a mother has a very high probability of being a single mother. as OP found out, marriage is not a guarantee. spouses die. and even if you stay together, many women in what they thought were equal partnerships end up doing most the work because of baked-in, unspoken expectations that men can't *really* be expected to change diapers, get up at night, etc.

i would advise almost anyone considering parenthood to not do it if there is not a very good support system in place independent of one's partner, or if you're 100% sure you can do it yourself no matter how much you're promised they will co parent with you."

He needs to be giving monetary support for your son. Also not sure how old your child is but traveling with him is totally possible at any age. Check out travelmad mum. She spent her maternity leave (England so long) traveling with her baby. She now has two and still travels regularly with one or both solo and with her husband. It’s totally doable. 
This is a great question and an embedded assumption in my OP. I’m assuming that emotional connection beyond some point is inappropriate. That point is when you feel strong attraction and a need to leave your current relationship to pursue those feelings further

"""the new head of HR is a girl"" to describe a 49 year old woman with international experience is demeaning. 

""I got lunch with that girl in finance the other day"" for an intern, ok maybe. 

The problem is when you describe someone as woman people tend to assume much older, especially in ESL (English second language) environments.

"It was pretty rough. My parents split when I was 8, and my father had emptied out their joint accounts before dropping the news on my mom. He had a lot of family support and was able to afford excellent lawyers. 

My mom had to pay him $900 a month in child support for my sister and I in the 90s. She was working two jobs and really stretched by it. Instead of using it on us as intended, it gave him an excuse to stop working. I remember him going out on dates with women he met through single parents groups, and being praised for being an amazing father, while we would split a can of soup for dinner, or be given moldy bagels for lunch. 

After many years of legal disputes, the courts changed the order to shared custody 50/50. He didn't get another job. He managed to live off an inheritance for a number of years, while pretending to work. 

In some ways he was a good dad but I can't help but blame him for all the years of neglect and for his actions putting my very hard-working mom on a lifetime track of poverty.  "

Anyway, I changed the route I took to leave school so that I’d be in front of him on the way out and walk super slow so I knew he’d see me. 

Spoiler alert: something in that mess made him actually talk to me and we’ve been together going on 6 years. Love is strange. "

"&gt;what a fucking system that allows that rather than letting the kids have a voice

This thread hits home hard and is really exhausting for me to fully contribute, so I was just going to lurk and hope everyone is doing OK, but I couldn't ignore your comment. Not having a voice in the courts was such a problem for me too! It's one of those things that still really bothers me about what I had to go through; not being listened to or taken more seriously by the courts. My mother was extremely abusive, but well connected and highly manipulative. The years of court battles were such a shit show for me and my dad, even with plenty of physical proof of abuse and testimonials from eye witnesses. My father lost twice before he was finally awarded full custody and parental rights when I was 7. I begged not to see my mother my entire childhood, but she was still allowed supervised visits and would continue to abuse me until I was 13 (she is really sick and cannot understand consequences or take responsibility, so even with everyone watching, she'd smack me down). I was told I didn't have a choice or legal say in anything until I was a teen. I don't really know how true that is either, but I've never regretted my choice to cut her out completely when I finally could. I'll never forget when I turned 13 and the feeling of finally having the power and control over my situation. I sort of formally declared to everyone, including her, that I would not have her in my life at all, in any manner, moving forward. I'm in my 30s now and I'm proud of the strength I found to do that for myself. I'm also proud of the 3 yr old me who spoke up in the first place, and never stopped. I'm proud of the adult I've become and the patience I've had to let myself heal and change the negative narrative in my head that these experiences bring. It would have been nice to have a mother, but I'm doing just fine without one. I owe a lot of my strength to the unwavering love and support my father gave me throughout my life. I wouldn't have survived without him. He is by no means perfect, but his love is genuine and my saving grace. The love of a parent or guardian is so important. My heart aches for those who didn't have this at least in some form. I think this is what can fundamentally make or break you. The people around us as we grow become that inner voice in our heads and if there was no one to tell you that you are loved, worthy of love, and that everything is going to be OK, then it is all that much harder to just get by in life. By all appearances, I had a shit childhood, but I feel so incredibly lucky to have had my dad. I've faired better in life than some peers who've had a two-parent home because it all boils down to this unconditional love. It took a long time and a lot of work, but I'm feeling just fine now; normal, confident, and well-adjusted. Families can look like anything. You can't judge based on appearances. "
"In high school, I had a crush on this boy from different class, we had 3 different parking lots at our school, I literally stopped using my usual  parking lot and changed to the one he used. I also deliberately arrived late or waited for his class just to say hi to him there and give him some chocolate"
"It wasn't lame in retrospect, but at the time he made me feel so small.

I was 14, he was 17. He was from Spain and barely spoke my language. I decided to learn Spanish to try to impress him. I wrote so many notes and vocab lists and talked to myself in the mirror to try to practice speaking. When I told him I had learned Spanish, he told me it was such a waste of time and I shouldn't have bothered. I went home and bawled.

I'm graduating next year with a degree in modern languages after discovering my passion for language learning thanks to him, so I guess I win, even though I never got him."
I'm really glad he was a safe place for you and your daughter. 
"“blindside me years later with ""so I have always had a crush on you"".”

I seriously, seriously hate this. I’ve slowly found out that pretty much every male who was ever friends with me from high school onward was just hoping to get in my pants. 

It happened again recently. I reconnected with an old friend I hadn’t seen in about 15 years and we were getting along swimmingly. Then he busts out the whole, “oh btw I’ve always liked you and I’m so sad you have a boyfriend”. 
Just...why?"
"I foster cats and kittens and about a year ago, an ~11wk old kitten called Storm decided to scare the crap out of me. 

I'd been loading the washing machine with towels, gone to the kitchen to get the tea towels, went back, shut the door and turned it on. About 5mins later I realise I couldn't see Storm anywhere, then heard a faint sound from the bathroom. Go in, see a flash of black in the spinning washing machine and rush to turn it off and open it. Bloody kitten had climbed in &amp; hidden under the towels in the less than a minute that I was out of the room. Thankfully he was fine. He shook for ages, shit the towels I was using to dry him, but was back to being happy and playing later that evening. No ill effects, and he even tried to climb back into the washing machine a week later!

I, on the other hand, still do kitten counts anytime I put on the washing machine or dryer. Even when I don't currently have any kittens, I'll get flashes of panic if I realise that I haven't done the count. I don't care how unlikely that one has gotten in, the washing machine doesn't get turned on until all kittens are counted. Even then I sometimes will pause when it's part way through the washing cycle to go count them again."
"I would use guys to a group of people, whether all male, all female or mixed. Not even to make a point, just that’s what seems normal to me."
“You’re my little fierce warrior” - i have a hedgehog. He thinks he’s a killer. 
"Yes! It should be ""I've never worn makeup before"" to uneven eyeliner and a visible foundation line between face and neck. "
"Thanks so much. I was in marketing and I’m going back to school to become a mental health counselor, with the goal of working with kids. 

It’s something I resisted for a long time out of fear, but life sort of forced my hand in the last year and it became obvious that it was now or never. "
"“I’m sorry that happened”

My cat got outside and overnight got beat up by somebody, not gravely but she got a good smack to the eye and was all scratched and seemed really sore all over. So of course I’ve been babying and sweet talking to her every minute since."
"Not OP, but I was in the exact same situation that she described... but unfortunately as the abuser. 

I don't normally like to post publicly about that period in my life, but something about OP's comment makes me want to show people what goes through the mind of the abuser at the time - Not to justify the abuse (it's inexcusable), but because abusers aren't always seen as human beings capably of redemption, and usually their stories end when they exit the life of the abused. On top of that, for those of us that are lucky enough to eventually get clean and move on with our lives, we experience the lifelong joy of living with the knowledge that at least for some period of time, we were the villains in our own stories and in the stories of the lives of the loved ones we broke. (Note: I didn't mean to write a novel, but it's what ended up happening and I'm just gonna let it be as is).

I am a speed and cocaine addict, as well as a raging alcoholic. I say that ""I am"" and not ""I was"", because addiction is for life. I'm clean now, but I've permanently rewired my brain to react a certain way to these substances and to the idea of these substances. 

It wasn't too long ago that I was still abusing drugs/alcohol, but I was also trying ""my best"" to get things under control. The thing is, it wasn't really messing up a lot of things in my life - I was doing well at a great job (showing up on time most days despite my outside activities), I had LOTS of friends, my finances were under control, etc etc. Not exactly the poster child of what drug abuse looks like. 

I was also dating a beautiful, devoted, loving woman who wanted to spend the rest of her life with me. The thing is, she was constantly living on edge because at least once per week, instead of being a happy party guy while on drugs and blackout drunk, I ended being a horribly (verbally) abusive demon who would destroy her emotionally and mentally. So you can imagine I had my fair share of promises to ""do better"" and to stop doing drugs/drinking.

I always ended up violating my then-girlfriend's trust though, through seemingly innocent compromises that I didn't think she needed to know about (I justified it by telling myself she didn't need to have more worries about me). I kept telling myself that I was just focusing on trying to keep my energy levels high and my brain working overtime FOR US, and I was convinced it would be too hard to function at work and socially if I didn't do these drugs and had to sober up. This invariably led to me ending up resenting my girl because she was the only one who actually ever tried to stop me from hurting myself in this way. My mentality was something along the lines of:

Why can't she just see that I am getting REALLY good shit for FREE from friends who I ACTUALLY love me for who I really am? Unlike HER, who can only love some version of me that no human could ever possibly live up to, so why can't she just FUCKING understand that I'm doing FINE, I'm killing it in every other aspect of my life except this dead-weight relationship where she just spends all day judging me and doubting me, bringing me down and really causing my problems in the first place. If she can just hold out for just a little bit longer and cut me a fucking break for just ONCE in my life, I can fix everything and get to where I need to be FOR US, and THEN I can focus on getting healthy ON MY OWN TIME. I'm an awesome person, and when I'm sober she admits I'm a great guy, and even when I'm fucked up everyone ELSE still thinks I'm a great guy, so if she can't handle me when I say fucked up shit when I'm blacked out, which I don't even REMEMBER saying but I apologized for ANYWAYS, then she can go fuck herself.

We'd broken up a lot of times before, but when she decided to leave me for good (I was sober at that moment) she was somehow the one in tears. I was so angry, because I'd taken (in my mind) a big step forward in trying to cut *some* of the drugs out of my life (but not alcohol or speed), and confronted her about how she could leave me right when I needed her most, and when we had all of these plans for our lives together. We had JUST talked about them the other day right before we got into our argument last night! Did this all mean nothing to her?

I'll never forget the look on her face as she left our apartment. For comparison's sake, I've seen my mother react to the news that her firstborn son died in a car crash. I've seen my entire family's reaction when we found out my younger sister shot herself in the head. Despite all of that, I've never seen someone cry so *miserably*, and yet so... indescribably. It was like I was watching her physically capture all of her love and compassion that she had for me, and then slowly say goodbye to every one of our past and future moments together one by one through each tear. I could FEEL the warm tenderness of her love as she sobbed uncontrollably, and then left saying ""If I stay with you any longer, it means that someday soon, I'm going to have to watch you die. I wouldn't be able to live after seeing that.""

It took until that moment to realize that I was the bad guy. 

There was no other way to cut it. I had just broken my love's heart, and it was all because I wanted to keep doing felonious levels of drugs. I was an alcoholic. I needed help. And I had just pushed away the only person who would have been willing and able to help me turn my life around.

I did recover from my addiction after that episode. By recognizing what I had done, I ended up breaking myself too. It took a lot of time and I had to cut off a lot of close relationships with people that I did (and still do) truly care about, but I'm healthy and happier than I have been in many years. 

But I'll still never forgive myself for what I did to her, even if she has or does someday. I've seen the exact moment that a loving heart breaks from crushing disappointment, and I won't ever forget it."
"My parents divorced when I was 3. My mom abandoned me at my grandparents when I was 9. I remember that night clearly. She kicked me out of her room and wouldn’t say I love you before I went to bed. I waited until she left and found a note in our bathroom saying she was going to kill herself (she didn’t) she was a drug addict and alcoholic. My dad came and got me that night and took me to his parents. Filed for custody and a year later he finally got me. He had attempted at least twice before but the system favor mother’s, even the batshit insane ones. 

He ran his own business and was super busy all the time. We also moved a ton. I spent a lot of time alone. Despite that we did spend a lot of time together driving and taking road trips were out thing. My two biggest Hobby’s  are the ones we shared. I love driving the back roads and fishing. We also went to the movies a lot. He did his best for me and went broke sending me to college and giving me many other opportunities. 

He is still helping me out a ton. I left my kids dad in September and I’ve been living in his second house rent free while, “working” for him. He’s allowed me to get on my feet. I start my new job in Seattle on the 8th and should be moving there this week, I find out today about an apartment. 

We are super close and talk almost daily. Can’t imagine what my life would be like if he weren’t my dad. He fought so hard to get me and give me everything I needed to have the best start in life. "
“You’re the most calm and rational person I know.”
Compliments from rivals is one of my favorite things ever 
"Had a huge win over anorexia today! Recovery is looking up day by day :)   
Codependency is still a huge asshole  
CPTSD is honestly the fucking worst. Looking to see if any EDMR specialists are in my area soon"
“I’ll miss you forever and I’ll love you for the rest of my life.”
Go for it. It’s not a turn off for me. A lot of men in other countries (read not the USA where I’m from) wear tinted moisturizer and concealer and it’s not considered feminine at all. A person dressed/done up in a way that makes them feel comfortable and confident is always appealing. 
"Hey, I wanted to let you know that it will get better. I have a 17 year old son that is my best friend. We go out to eat all the time, he's the first person I do 99% of my activities with. We know each others work schedules and activities so we know when we are going to hang out after school or work etc. Everything I do revolves around my kids but especially my eldest. He takes me out sometimes as well when he can afford it or we just sit and binge The OA on Netflix. Your kid will hopefully become your best friend hopefully someday, or at least one of their best friends. Don't let your child think that you feel any less of him because it could very well grow into resentment when he's older and you won't be close. I have several people in my life that envy my relationship with my kids and it is really great. I love them and sometimes I cry at night thinking of when they will go away someday. I used to be like you when they were very young and I'm a single mother as well. Things will get better! "
"It has taken me a long time to admit, but I now recognize that I emotionally cheated on an ex boyfriend. The guy I was involved with had been a long time “friend” that I carried a very flirtatious dialogue with over several years (before I met the ex). Due to circumstance, he and I never had a chance to date. This left me a feeling empty, so I pursued other men like my ex to fill that space in my life. However, over the course of that relationship, I found myself checking out emotionally. Most of my energy was poured into long text conversations and late night calls with my friend. While the conversations weren’t sexual in nature, I was betraying my partner by continuing to invest my time in that guy. The affair had a clearly negative impact on the relationship. When we went long distance, my boyfriend ended things and I think he also suspected me of cheating (physically).

Do I regret what I did? Absolutely. Would I do it again? Absolutely not. Shortly after the breakup, I went totally no contact with my friend. After explaining why we couldn’t talk any more, I unfriended and blocked him on all social media platforms and deleted his number/text history. Every once in a while he will send a text or a friend request from a new account. I never respond, and every time I see his name my heart sinks. All feelings of warmth and excitement that I used to feel for this guy are replaced by pure guilt. I never want to hurt another person like I did. It scares me to know that I have it in me to be such chicken shit to someone who treated me as well as my ex did."
"My mum died when I was 4 and my brother was 2. Dad raised us alone. When I was little I thought life was pretty perfect. Looking back he definitely needed help.

He didn’t teach me to brush my hair properly so for a long time I thought you just brushed the front and he didn’t notice until my hair was an absolute mess and he spent ages angrily untangling it.

When my period started he didn’t talk to me about it really and asked me to talk to my grandma who used to have to attach sanitary towels to a belt so she wasn’t especially helpful.

He was very defensive if anything went wrong. If I missed my mum he would become upset and ask how he had let me down because if I was upset about mum I must be disappointed with him. I was afraid about my mental health when I was 15 as I started to become delusional. (This stayed with me until my mid twenties when it then changed into more general anxiety and paranoia). I spoke to my dad at 15 and he told me I was going through a phase and once again took it as a slight against his parenting. 

Sex and sexual health has never been discussed. 

He has very old fashioned ideas about women so I am not allowed to swear in front of him (I’m 27) he has also told me not to get tattoos, or speak about sex or periods because it is unladylike which does create a barrier.

Though he had his shortcomings (like all parents) he worked relentlessly to build a life for my brother and I. He kept us to a solid routine, gave us stability and loved us to pieces. we are still very close. It’s been great to be so close to my dad and it has given me the opportunity to reflect a lot about my expectations of men and how I wish to be treated which has been useful. 

.... turns out I had more to say about that than I though! Sorry!

It is an absolute shame that women aren't given 100% complete control over when (no matter what trimester it is in) they want to terminate a pregnancy. I hope a day comes when women in the future don't have to live with the same indignities that we do. You did what you thought was right for you under the circumstances and I applaud you. Not sure if you can sue the hospital you went to because they are supposed to tell you what week you're in and your options are.
I rode the bus 45 minutes after school to be close to him. I was going in the compete wrong direction from my home and I never actually talked to him. Repeat that every day for a few months.
"Personally, most of the time, it doesn't bother me. I don't see it as patronizing or infantilizing when used casually, like ""hey girl!"" ""I saw this beautiful girl today"" or ""that girl has an amazing shirt"". 

However, within certain contexts it makes me cringe. ""You girls are all the same"", ""stupid girl"", ""you don't know what you're saying, little girl"" are all gross and just examples of how the term can intentionally be used in a misogynistic, obnoxious, condescending manner. It's one of the instances in which I think intent is greater than impact, ie, if the person saying it meant perfectly well and I still choose to be offended, it's a bit different than when they were being intentionally gross and hurt me in the process. 

That being said, I much prefer ""girls"" over ""feeeeeemaaalles""."
I always think about this as a guy and feel uncomfortable in this scenario. I just want to yell “I swear I’m not rapist.” 
"I have a son and I've always known I wanted a kid/kids.  While being a single parent isn't easy, I can say with 100% certainty that I'd still want a child even if I could go back in time with the knowledge that I'd be divorced. 

I think you made an excellent point and if you wouldn't want a child if you were on your own, you're probably better off sticking with that decision when you're in a relationship. "
"The ones that wait until you're in a relationship are the best.

I ended up ditching one of my best friends last year... because he waited like two years, until I actually started seeing someone to tell me that he was super into me.

For people seeing ""tell your friend you like them"", ONLY DO THAT IF THEY ARE NOT CURRENTLY WITH SOMEONE.

Putting someone in that position is awful, and definitely not something you would do to someone you actually care about. You're putting a strain on their relationship, and basically throwing away your friendship."

"27F. I feel like everyone that’s commented share similarities.. it’s great to finally free yourself of the toxicity that comes with social media.. I honestly don’t know how the “Instagram famous” people do it.


I deleted twitter because I found myself *needing* to tweet.. I wanted to be apart of conversations or feel “seen” I guess you could say.. and if I didn’t get a reply or reaction it would subconsciously fuck with me.


I deleted Facebook.. because it was honestly a bunch of negativity.. either old HS classmates stuck in the past.. people complaining about their lives for everyone to see.. politics.. those horny people that always over share.. and etc..it was draining. I only reactivate when I need to find something or do something that requires it.


Instagram took me the longest to delete. I felt somewhat important on there because I could capture my good moments.. my “good looking” days.. my cool material things.. etc. not realizing that this is what everyone else is doing too..and comparing myself to the pretty girls with tons of followers and not having the same aesthetic as them.. I deleted IG for about 2 years.. and only recently made a new page like a couple weeks ago.. because I thought “hey it’s been long enough.. I should be fine.. I just want to see other people’s posts”... nope.. went back down that same dark hole.. so I’ve been avoiding it once again.


I only keep Snapchat to see my god kids.. and refrain from checking other people’s stories all the time. Unless I’m super bored or something.


I like Reddit because you don’t really see each user individually and not a competition.. it’s not a bunch of self posts (unless you want it to be; subscribed to those subreddits)"

"This is a couple habit, but we're very content and comfortable holing up and just doing nothing together. We both like to do things and get out, and would love to do more stuff, and we're trying to get back, but the habit we've created to just spend all of our time together is easy to fall into. He used to travel for work every week. He worked in my city, so he'd leave Thursday afternoon and be gone until Monday morning. Prime activity time. And we were so busy during the weekdays he was here, that it was a lot of ""let's grab dinner and just go home and *be* together."" We didn't have a lot of time, so it was scarce and precious. We'd do activities with our friends on the weekend.
