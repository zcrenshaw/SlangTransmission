"I write down everything i'm feeling, even if some of the things come out a little crazy and i'm overthinking. It's a chance to verbal vomit onto the pages.  Then i go out and book a high energy workout, go on a hike or run. 

Once i'm back, heart thumping and lungs on fire... I sit down and re-read what I wrote, then I cross out everything that now sounds ridiculous in red ink.

It helps me realize how perspective is everything in life, often we see things as worse than they are when we feel down. Our minds can work against us more often than we realize."
My brother moved to England after Bush won re-election and he and his wife remain in Europe to this day.
"Yes. It was a boy I went to middle/high school with. Everyone kind of ignored him, and I felt bad, so I tried to be his friend. He made me uneasy from the very beginning, in a way that’s difficult to describe. His facial expressions didn’t reach his eyes, if that makes sense. They seemed dead. One time he invited me to the park near our school, but right before we entered the woods, my sister saw me walking with him and made me go home with her. He was 16, I was 13. 

He proceeded to stalk me for six or so years. He would show up at my house late at night and throw rocks at my bedroom window. I moved houses and he somehow found out where that was too, and I started seeing him walking past my house several times a week.  He eventually ended up getting expelled when I was in the 11th grade for having a list in his locker with a list of people he wanted to kill. I was on the list. So...fuck politeness."
I think that I prefer them to STIs and pregnancy
"I was in abusive relationship for 20 years, 15 of them married. We had four kids and not only was he physically and psychologically abusive, he was financially abusive. I earned about 15% of the household income, but he required that I pay 50% of the bills. Which made saving up enough to leave tough. 

I started by renting a storage locker and every month I would tell him I came up short and couldn't pay a bill or two. In reality, I was stocking the storage locker with used bargains I found at yard sales, on Facebook, Costco trips, etc. A few hundred a month at a time until I had everything I needed.

My parents helped me tremendously financially. They gave me the security deposit and first month's rent on a house. That would have taken me another two years to sock away slowly. I would have done it if I hadn't had their support, but I'm eternally grateful I didn't have to. Another two years in that relationship might literally have killed me.

So the kids and I got out. And I swear to you, the feeling of pride in myself I had when my BFF and I rolled up to that storage in the truck (her twin infants sleeping in the back) one Wednesday late morning to move that stuff into our new place was amazing.

Against every odd, and every fucking roadblock that fucker put up... I did it. And there was a whole house full of furniture, towels, toiletries, kitchen supplies, sheets, clothing, books, and electronics and everything else a home needs sitting in that storage locker that proved I could do this. 

I never let his abuse over every bill I told him I couldn't pay stop me. I kept going until that storage locker was filled to the brim.

My BFF and I moved it all while her twins napped and set it all up. I didn't need a thing from the marital house or my ex. And when it was all set up, I just wandered the house marvelling at the fact that I did it.

The kids and I moved in two days later and life's been fucking amazing ever since. I wish I had found that courage and determination many years before I did, but I also recognize that I could have easily never found it. So I choose to admire myself for finding it at all."
"Oh, man. He thought it was much more than a date! 

Gave him a friendly half-hug goodbye and dude went, ""I can't believe I have such an amazing **girlfriend**."" 

I had no idea how to react and no idea how he'd react if I said anything. I ignored the comment and just turned a left. When I got home, I texted him to confirm that's what he'd said. It was, my ears were working. I told him that I wasn't his girlfriend, it wasn't a date, and that he can't just enter a relationship without *without the other person being aware*. 

He was very confused and still thought I was his girlfriend."
"A lot of fake friends. Girls didn’t want to be my friends for whatever reason so I ended up being friends with all guys. Took me a long time to realize guys only were my “best friends” for one reason and I ended up with no friends at all. 

Heartbreaking when you find out none of your best friends and confidants are actually real. 

I always envied the girls who had a ton of girlfriends around."
"Yes. It was a cultural misunderstanding. My ex who was an international student from Asia first came on to me by asking me if I wanted to study together.

In the US, studying together is NOT a date. It’s not uncommon for you to study with male classmates as just friends. But in his culture, pretty much any time a guy asked a girl to do something one-on-one, it was a date. 

So we met for a few of these study “dates” in the library where we went over quizzes, did coursework, and made casual conversation. Then one time he tried to hold my hand while we walked home and I gave him a look of “wtf are you doing?” 

Embarrassing for all parties, but he did ask me out on a proper date soon after. We were together for 2 years."
"I've told this story before, it was early 2000s, chatting online with this guy. He was cute, we liked the same music, but he kept on insisting to meet and I wasn't sure...

He then started to tell me he knew where I worked and he'd come and check me out. The more I think of it, the more details I had forgotten through the years. He did actually show up at my job (sports equipment store) but I saw him and went in the back. My coworker knew about him because I had told him about my concerns with meeting a stranger, so he said I didn't work that day.

Anyway, time passed, 2-3 months after I see on the news that he's wanted by the police for murder. They found him.

The guy's motto was to find girls to seduce in order to steal from them. So, one night the girl he met wasn't supposed to be home and she came back to him and his friend stealing, they beat her to death and they cut her in pieces and threw away the body parts in different luggages.

Yep. I still remember his name, he's still in jail. And because of my gut feeling I'm still alive."
"I was (still am?) A late bloomer and didn't have my glow up until college. I wouldn't say this has affected me too much outside of the fact that when I get male attention now I'm still a bit unsure of how to handle it. My flirtation skills are severely lacking, I usually go into ""bro"" mode with a guy and act as a potential friend rather than potential partner."
Why are all the ghosts wearing old timey clothes when so many people have died since the 20s? Why are there no ghosts wearing bellbottoms or backwards baseball caps or yoga pants?
"Yes, that is the best way.  I want to get to know someone, make sure they are a good person and not a serial killer before I let them into my sacred lady garden."
Having to be quiet while masturbating as a teenager. For some reason I see men on Reddit talk about this all the time when they're trying to explain why men are quiet/unresponsive during sex. Doesn't enter their heads that teenage girls masturbate too.
I sometimes think about conversations I'm about to have and try to predict how they will unfold. Problem is I sometimes do it in public and catch myself mouthing or making faces.
"I'd spend a lot more time walking around at night on my own. I love it when there's no harsh light, the streets are quiet and if I'm lucky I can see the whole night sky stretching for billions of lightyears before me."
"I've never been able to develop feelings for someone who wasn't a friend. I need a strong connection like that with someone before any feelings, attraction, or interest of that sort can even start."
"Do you think he marked on his calendar ""Our very first fight ❤❤"""
Hate the smell after but glad I am not pregnant
They give a such a piece of mind about STI and pregnancy prevention that in my opinion it’s worth it. But I highly suggest trying different brands/types because they really do make a difference.
"I come to grips with the fact that my position in life isn't the best suited for a relationship right now, allow myself to be displeased by this, and wait until the feeling inevitably passes, as it always does. 

In other words, I acknowledge the reality of a temporarily uncorrectable situation and accept it."
"My partner’s uncle moved to Sweden in the 80s because he wanted to live in a country with a more socialist government. He’s been there ever since, has a Swedish family, speaks Swedish perfectly, etc."
"To me, the biggest difference is the emotional aspect. Granted, it depends on the individual but usually with men, you carry most of the emotional labor and it is very hard to get them to communicate meaningfully when there is an issue.

It's a bit of a battle to get men to open up, it takes patience and also emotional labor from you, which is a contrast from women who are more open to starting communication from the get-go. 

Other than that, sex tends to be a bit more sensual with women. With men, it fluctuates but I've always enjoyed sex with men when there has been a meaningful relationship."
"Couple things - 

1. I started to associate my value with my looks. I thought that was the only thing I could contribute, because that’s the only thing people noticed. It’s nice to be called pretty, but it’s even nicer when you’re complimented on your personality, intelligence, etc. It took me awhile to find a part of myself that I was proud of that didn’t revolve around physical appearance. 

2. Everyone assumed I would be mean or stuck up! I was assumed so and talked about in a negative way from a very young age. I had to be extra, extra nice to every single person I spoke to. If I wasn’t, it would spread fast. I never gave anyone a reason to hate me, and while it might’ve been for a strange reason it turned me into a really empathetic person. I never wanted to make someone feel bad, and I honestly don’t think I ever have. That was a good thing."
"Yes. My aunt had just gotten a divorce from her abusive husband and was left with two 13 year old daughters. She went on a vacation that year to cheer herself up and met this weird looking tattoed guy. They began dating and got married in a span of 4 months. She said he was very nice and supportive but i always thought he had the creepiest smile I've ever seen. I didn't see him many times, but every time I'd get this uncanny feeling like he was watching me. I remember one day when i came to visit them with my parents, i walked past his window and heard some strange sounds (naive 11 old me didn't realise this was actually porn). When i peeked through his window i saw him leaning over his laptop with a funny expression on his face and got this gut feeling that i should get the fuck away from that room. Three years later someone reported him and the cops found tons of child pornography in his laptop. He was soon found dead in his car, at the ther part of the country. The bastard had commited suicide."
"I’m constantly judging people and then chastising myself. It’s stuff like, “Oof I would not wear leggings if I looked like that.” Followed quickly by, “oh my GOD. Why would you think something like that? She can rock whatever she damn well pleases. You’ve been on the bigger side of life too and you know what it’s like. Fuck you. Fuck you and your knee-jerk reactions...” and that just turns into a fun and fast little guilt spiral that I then have to focus on not thinking about or I’ll start to get outwardly uncomfortable."
"My sister's friend did in 2008 when Obama won.

He enlisted, saw combat in Afghanistan, and came back with a really severe case of PTSD, and is now essentially a communist."
"in a large public setting, i sometimes wonder what i would do if we were all suddenly put into danger. For instance if a gunman started shooting at us, a sudden earthquake or tsnuami, an explosion, etc"
"Yes. I met a young man in his early twenties who was hanging around a Kids little league game. He was overly friendly to my dog and didn’t respond to limits about not letting the dog lick his face, no matter what I said about the dog being young and needing to learn manners.  He then spoke to my 12 year old son and wanted to become friends on PS4, gave his information to my son. I took the information and forbid my son to ever have anything to do with him. He was arrested a year later and sentenced to 20 years for soliciting child pornography from 3 male minors."
"I stole $20 from my mom when I was in 4th grade. During that same day, instead of buying cookies for myself, I gave the $20 to another kid who didn't have any lunch.

I remember a couple of days before, I went in the lunch line with him and the lady gave him a PB&amp;j sandwich because his parents weren't paying for his lunch. I remember how disappointed he was because it was pizza day. So...to see him not get any lunch at all days after, it bothered me.

I knew I could have used $1 to buy cookies and given him some money. But when they give you pb&amp;J's that means that you already have a bill that your parents haven't been paying. I don't know how much he owed the cafeteria, but I do know that I at least took off $20."
"Oh man. One of my best friends from the first year of high school until I was 24.. I mean one of two people I would’ve called my best friends. One night we were hanging out, nothing unusual, he asked “would it be weird if we dated?” And I said “why would it be weird?” And then the conversation continued in a different direction and it was nothing. We had plans to hang out the next weekend and I picked him up he got in the car, held my hand, and said his mom was so happy we were finally together. 

I was so stunned I didn’t say anything until the next day. Things never went back to normal. Even though he knew we weren’t together he got so jealous, almost scary. If I didn’t text back he’d get all cold and tell me I was “obviously getting my attention elsewhere”. Tried for a long time to keep the friendship alive, but we eventually stopped talking altogether."
It's wonderful when the trash takes itself out.
Force myself to go outside. Especially now that summer is here and there’s plenty of sunshine. Even just a few minutes of walking around the block in the sun can do amazing things. Trust in nature!
"As a man, I feel the same about getting to know someone better before spraying them with my sacred garden hose."
"At my office job one day a customer came in and I immediately got a bad vibe from him. He was probably in his twenties and with a girl who looked roughly the same age, the girl was super quiet and didn’t look up the whole time he was there. While he was waiting in the lobby I got one of my coworkers to come sit at my desk because I didn’t want to be there alone. 

Everything was fine that day but he started coming into the office once a week (way more than he needed to) and everyone knew to keep an eye on him while he was in the office. One day I came into the office and his face was all over the local news because he had been arrested for being involved in human trafficking. 

Once he got out of jail he started coming in again all the time, I left that job and found out from coworkers that after I left he kept asking people to tell him my phone number or address so he could “say goodbye” because he missed me. Blegh. Thank goodness for good coworkers."
"Once a dude told me he was having ""some people over to his lake house"". He lived near me and told me he could pick me up. I very quickly realized it was just him and me for the night once we arrived."
"Wish I had the courage of these other posters.

I just waited 36 years for him to die."
You know which one.
"Men and women handle rejection incredibly differently. When I reject a woman, she normally internalises and thinks *she* is the problem. When I reject a man, he normally externalises and thinks *I* am the problem.

Women also don't expect me to do all the emotional labour, don't need their hand held through basic household tasks and don't make a massive song and dance over height differences, who pays on dates etc like men do."
My professor revoked her U.S citizenship after the election
Feeling pressured to not express emotions and not having emotional support.
I just lay down and cry a lot
Sounds like your sister had a good instinct; she may have saved your life! Glad she happened by at the right time!
That would make me EXTREMELY uncomfortable and never want to talk to him again.  He tricked you and thought you'd be into it?  No thanks
"Late bloomer here. Spent high school feeling massively   insecure and dorky.  Had very oily skin and bad acne, which didn't help my self esteem. Definitely not the best years of my life! That feeling still comes back sometimes, especially when I'm low.

Now? I have good skin, look younger than my age and have more confidence. I like to think of it as my reward for suffering through my teens!"
"Friend said she’s move to UK if trump won and she did, turns out she was planning to move anyway lol"
"Just security and validation. For example, if you go on a trip for a week with the guys, and I get sad that you're leaving, just validate my feelings. Tell me you love me, give me a hug, say you'll miss me. Don't act as if me being sad means that I don't want you to go on the trip, it just means I'll be sad and I want you to validate my feelings"
"I would never ever tell him this, but the reason that sex with my boyfriend has always reminded me of sex with women. 

More sensual, less penetration focused, he’s more responsive. 

So much better than sex  it’s guys usually is."
Balding. I know several women who lost lots of hair especially involving child birth and breastfeeding and one never recovered. Yet it seems many men think of it as an exclusively masculine woe.
"Adults who still have their teddy bears, raise your hand!

"The men Ive dated have been low maintenance but high emotional labor, the women have been higher maintenance and took more emotional energy?  
My house stays nice and tidy and I dont feel like a pseudo-mom with women, but I'm fucking exhausted."
"I went to a tiny little private school before high school and then had to go to the public high school. Somehow, all the girls from the public school ganged up and decided I was ""too ugly"" to go to their school. They added me on MSN and sent horrible messages, left notes in my mailbox. I had no choice but to go, so they started a rumor that I was a lesbian and had raped one of the special ed girls. It was horrible for a couple hours, and then the ""popular"" boys noticed me and took me under their wing and then everyone wanted to be my friend. Throughout high school the girls would be rude about my appearance, though. I wouldn't say I was considered the *most* attractive, but after several years of being super self-conscious of my face I realized that they were calling me ugly because they were threatened, not because I was, in fact, too ugly."
"Yeah. Was walking around the city at night, trying to reconnect with a friend who had gone off with her GF for a date, so we could go home. I came across this man — I actually didn’t see him at first, I could hear there was someone behind me, and I felt like something was off, so I let him pass me. A few minutes later, he turned around and started walking towards me again, asking how he could get to a certain street. I told him it was one block over, and he didn’t actually need to come back towards me to get to it — I’m telling you, something about this man, who was good looking, normal looking, was setting me off.

And I was right to be on edge around him.  Seconds later his hand was under my skirt, on my ass, and he was talking about how much money he could get for me. 

In hindsight, what I did next wasn’t the smartest move, but it deescalated the situation. I sat down on the closest stoop, pulled out my phone, called my friend and ignored him. He left once he heard someone was coming. We were also in a nice, residential part of the city, so I’m sure he wasn’t looking to drag me kicking and screaming off somewhere, because people would’ve heard."
"A hot shower, comfy pjs, cup of hot coffee or tea, and a lot of soft blankets. Then, something to distract like a book or a show."
"It learned me to be really careful around men/guys. To this day I'm still called ""stuck up"" quite often, but that's just me trying not too give off the wrong impression"
"I was plain in school and nothing has changed. People get attracted to my personality, not my face. That’s fine."
"He was a friend from work actually! He kept telling me how great this one burger place in our city was and I’d never been, so he offered to take me because it was so good. I never even considered it a date, genuinely my fat ass just thought he wanted me to experience this amazing burger. We got back to work a couple days later and he was acting kinda weird around me so I texted him asking if something was wrong when I got home and he was like “I thought this was us finally giving things a go” and I was totally shocked! I was interested in someone else so I let him down gently, and he was a total superstar about it and didn’t make things awkward at all!
Funnily enough he’s really successful now and has a great girlfriend and I’m massively proud of how far he’s come, we still talk a lot but we’re just good friends now, for sure!"
"Realizing that you are living in the moment - having fun with something and simply ""being"""
"We live in an enormous, diverse, strange, and wonderful world that most people have seen none percent of. If the notion that there literally billions of people, all of whom have a unique experience, doesn't fill you with curiosity, then I'm not sure how to explain it."
"I read somewhere once that your initial thought is what society has conditioned in you and your response after that is who you actually are. So don’t feel guilty, give yourself a break because who you actually are cares about people."
I don't think it's nearly as easy to get a residence permit in a foreign country as people who say nonsense like that imagine. I do know several people who have left various South American countries as a result of political developments in their home countries though.
"Went to a movie, I thought it was as friends, drove me home and wouldn't let me out of his car as he very aggressively asked me out. I said no and he kept telling me I need to think about it over and over. After about 5 minutes of this he finally unlocked his car and let me out."
"I have a few big pillows I can always snuggle with! They’re a lot softer than he is, but not as warm unfortunately."
Seems like a whole bunch of men (incels) can't seem to understand that women also get rejected by romantic interests.
"Honestly they feel kinda shitty, but at the same they're really fucking important. I don't think you can do without one unless you're in a super committed long ass relationship."
Zoning out and not thinking about anything. I see this a lot on Reddit specifically - men going on about how they come home and sit on the couch and just chill. It's really not a gender specific phenomenon.
"Yeah, Lincoln was a very controversial president at the time."
Just do it gradually.  Start with what you can do and move to the next step once you're comfortable.
Leaving the country by going on a mission to risk his life for said country. Unexpected approach.
How it works out in the parallel universe where other me made the opposite decision or choice.
"My life gets back to basics - sleeping, eating, getting a little exercise, going to work, doing what I need to do to get through.  My expectations for myself shrink - that's not the right time to push out of my comfort zone, unless it's specifically targeted therapy."
"Sup. Vietnamese dude here who've studied in the US for a bachelor degree. ""Asking to study together"" in Vietnam can very well be taken as a date. It is shown in some movies as how 2 interested guy and girl would  break the ice and such.

So yeah, I think it's definitely a cultural misunderstanding there. I appreciate OP for not being too harsh to him."
"I guess if I wasn't scared of job and financial security, I'd take a gap year and go traveling..."
Oh I feel you on the bro mode. I’m terrible at flirting lol
"Having to pay for stuff. 

Apparently some men don't understand that we do have to fend for ourselves and actually don't even want a guy to pay anything most of times, as that rarely happens out of being nice."
"Yes, when I was a teenager I accompanied my father out to a remote resort that was under construction at the time. I loved it there, helped out around the site, got to know all the people working on it, and was there for about two weeks.

But there was one guy that gave me the chills. There was a small hill with a house on top of it, wooden with large windows. It was perched just above the resort, and that's where the caretaker and his wife lived. Just going near that house gave me the chills. The woods behind it, an even deeper fear. I was an outdoorsy kid, but those woods were something else. My dad seemed to have noticed it too and warned me away from those woods and from the caretaker.

At some point later, my dad saw the man hit his wife during a group dinner. They argued then got into a fight. My father's a big guy and decked him, grabbed him, and threw him off the dock into the ocean.

Not long after we had left the resort, probably a few months, we heard on the news about [Traigo Andretti](https://warriorpublications.wordpress.com/2014/07/28/convicted-murderer-laughs-during-court-appearance/), the caretaker, accused of being a serial wife murderer and on trial for dismembering the sweet woman I'd known and burying her in the back woods that I'd been so afraid of as a teen."
"""Could I learn to love that person"""
Giving and receiving a hug🥰
My friend moved to New Zealand after W was re-elected. Still lives there.
"I am not going to repeat what others have said, as they already said it best but I will add - do not be offended by our caution.  When I was doing online dating, many men who were strangers to me, would get insulted that I didn't trust them enough to meet them somewhere private. I became super strict that if a guy did ANYTHING to demonstrate that he did not respect my need for safety, I would block him."
"The guy who took my senior photos. He was a really good photographer, and my photos turned out great. Then he asked if I could do some under a waterfall. I thought, that sounds cool! So I did them, in my swim suit. And it started to feel a little weird.

Yeah, turns out he was arrested for child porn just a few weeks later. I saw it on the news. My parents have always kicked themselves for letting me do those waterfall photos. They threw them all away."
"I’ve noticed that women are much more open to and faster to commit to or start a relationship and men are more likely to start some form of intimacy then freak out and back off when they start feeling like it’s becoming “too much” like a relationship. Like women are more open to intimacy developing and deepening over time (though sometimes it’s not enough time, imo), but men want the intimacy up front, but then are scared of the commitment that they expect comes after it. All of these issues can be fixed with open and honest communication, but men tend to view communication as commitment, so we’re back to square one with their fears of intimacy 😂 overall, I find men more emotional exhausting and draining than women for this reason."
"It didn't have a lot of impact because I had 0 self-esteem and never really understood or believed when people were interested in me.  
  
To this day if you don't lay it out very clearly, it will probably go over my head."
"I had a lot of rumours started about me from guys who wanted to hook up with me, but didn’t. I was also called a whore and a slut a lot by girls in high school mostly from when guys were interested in me instead of them."
Why are there no ghosts from even further back? No loin cloth ghosts?
Sexual frustration.
"They’re a great, non hormonal contraception"
"I hear this one a lot, a lot of men seem to forget that girls and women actually masturbate."
"Aww that’s really cute. Still though, gonna need some of our Asian redditors to confirm this. Otherwise he might have just come up with a really creative excuse LOL"
"""Fuck Obama! I'm getting the hell out of here! By giving my life to support Obama's military endeavors! Screw that guy!""

"Not me but my brother went to school with a guy that always seemed off to him. So off that he befriended him just in case he decided to shoot up the school.
My brother is 23 now, and he just found out that the guy was arrested for the murder of his grandmother.
Five years ago.
He pushed her down the stairs and kicked her, killing her, and then hid her body in the house for a while until it started to stink. He then buried her in his backyard. He confessed just a couple weeks ago"
"More than once. Immature people often try to stealth date by acting like you are going out as friends/hiding their actual intentions and then you find out when you go that they are trying to make it a date instead. When it has happened to me, I've ended the excursion and stopped being close/friendly with the person. Trying to manipulate someone into a date is not appropriate and not acceptable."
"It took courage to deal with whatever you went through in those 36 years. I hope you have found peace now that it’s all behind you. You’re strength is a different kind, but you are strong nonetheless."
"Probably the reason why I arrived in my 30s without never having a STD or an unwanted pregnancy. 

I have an IUD, but I never tell this to a guy unless we’re serious. I just say “I’m not on the pill”, which is true, and that will avoid they making excuses to not wear a condom. But I got a bit paranoid  lately and I think it’s crazy to rely only on a IUD to avoid pregnancy."
I've seen men refuse to walk through a door if a woman is holding it open for them.
Clean sheets and shaved legs. Particularly in the morning when you wake up in the most comfortable position you have ever felt.
"This is a great one that I don't see acknowledged very often! A lot of men seem to think that because it's considered ""normal"" for women to be emotional, that means people respect our emotions. In my experience, a lot of the time women still don't get emotional support *and* we're preemptively dismissed because men expect us to get all \~emotional\~ about things."
"A few pointers: If they're holding you against themselves so you can't use your hands, stomp your foot. Try to forceful run your shoe down their shin from knee to foot. The shin rub is painful, and arches of feet are very sensitive. If you can break a bone in the foot they won't be able to chase you very long. You can also try to kick backwards into their crotch. Crouching a little and pulling them forward may make them lose balance momentarily. Eyes are also sensitive if you can get to them. If someone grabs your arm or hands, twist it in the opposite direction to break grip. And again, never be afraid to go for a crotch kick or even a forceful grab. Better to crush their junk than let them try to use it on you. You can grab while facing them or if they're pulling you in from behind, reach behind you so your arm is back there with easy access to his junk. Hope this helps and you never actually have to use any of these moves!"
"A neighbour when I was a kid.  I hated her on sight. I was absolutely terrified of her &amp; she was my mothers best friend for a while.  Turned out she was a very charismatic nutter.  She would do things like starve her kids, lock them in their rooms so they had to poop in the cat tray if they needed to go.  Bought a huge farm &amp; made her 3 kids all under 15 basically run the place for her.   She also insisted her oldest son had diabetes and would lug him from doctor to doctor trying to get treatment for him.  Turns out when she found out my mother type 2 and knew more about it than she did he magically got better.   The reason her son was so growth stunted, skinny &amp; thirsty all the time was he wasn't allowed in the damn kitchen &amp; barely got fed.    In the end my mother found out &amp; moved heaven &amp; earth to help 2 of the 3 kids, the third got severe brain trauma in an accident &amp; is stuck at home with her forever.  Nothing we could legally do could get him out of there, she just beat us at every turn.     35 years later still friends with the 2 my mum got out of there, they turned out OK."
Diarrhea is not sexist.
"This one hurts. It didn’t hit me until this year how lonely I was because I had no girlfriends. I do have one very close and special friend, but we don’t see each other too often because of college."
Butt hair. I've seen this listed as an annoyance of the *male* body.
"We're no longer friends and last I heard he's dating someone just as inappropriate and weird as him and they're super happt, so, there *is* someone for everyone."
"Better lines of communication with women, the sex is much better, and I also feel more comfortable around women - in that, with things like stretch marks and not wearing makeup, I know there will be no judging because she can relate?"
"21 years ago. My family was across the country so it wasn't an easy ""across town trip."" But I had a plane ticket ready and on the day I left, I packed a bag with what I absolutely couldn't leave without, dropped my cat with a trusted friend, and left while he was at work. Did not let on that I was leaving *at all.* Didn't tell anyone at my job, didn't tell anybody.

By the time he realized I was gone, I was halfway across the country. At that point, I was willing to leave everything else behind. I just wanted to get out."
"emotional validation. not babying, not even sympathy, but just acknowledging that we have the right to feel certain ways and that it can't be argued/reasoned with, and that just because we are ''irrational'' does not mean we are ''wrong''.

i'd be comfortable saying that this is responsible for 70% of women's decisions to divorce non-abusive men, if not more."
"When I first met my husband in high school, I didn't really think of him romantically. I liked him as a person and we became friends, but I was dating his friend and one of my friends had a crush on him so he was just off my radar. Then after high school, things went south with my boyfriend and my friend was dating someone else, and I started to really appreciate how sweet and funny he was. Almost two decades later, he's still my best friend.

So my vote is for friends first. 10/10, would recommend."
"If it's dark and I'm walking home from the grocery store, ignore me. Don't try strike up a conversation or go out of your way to prove you're one of the good guys. Please don't stare at me either. I'm assuming a guy is looking cause he might decide to say something and now I gotta dig in my purse and make a wolverine type fist with my keys while my cell phone is in the other hand texting a friend incase something pops off.

If you're also walking, I don't expect you to go out of your way but maybe keep a distance or walk a block over if you can. 

Best yet, correct other men's behavior when you're in a group. Encourage them not to cat call or yell out of their vehicle. 

You don't have to go out of your way to prove you're a good guy. Just don't do bad guy things."
"Not really, honestly. Acquaintances would be best. I’d like to know him well enough that he’s vetted and not crazy or unstable, but I don’t want a good friendship to become a relationship. 

I only dated a good friend once and while the relationship was good, the friendship part was a letdown. There was no fun getting-to-know-you period because we already knew each other. It felt weird trying to figure out what made it a relationship now. We had to awkwardly tell all our friends. everyone felt invested in it. I didn’t like the attention or pressure. Then we had to awkwardly tell everybody we broke up. I lost a friend. Plus since the breakup the friendships have his cloud over them and if I hang out in a group of my college friends I have to tell my boyfriend that my ex is going to be there. I wouldn’t choose it again."
"orgasm probably 90% of the time with women and like 10% of the time with men

women also seem to be way more concerned with your pleasure and also don't seem to cross boundaries without asking/assuming what you like. like, i've *never* had a woman try to choke me or hit me or call me slurs without asking first."
"Our shelter had a policy of not adopting out pitbulls. After the stray hold they'd be euthanized. (this was probably 15 years ago) I worked at a vet clinic and forged paperwork so people could pull the puppies from the shelter as ""owners"" and find homes for them. The first batch was for two 9-ish week old puppies. I have no regrets."
"I was mad at her for this, but now I’m grateful that she was looking out for me. Big sisters have good instincts."
"Sometimes we just want to vent about our problems, not have anyone “fix” them."
I love that they make everything less messy and am glad that prevents STIs :)
oh mannnnn. I ran into a friend of a friend randomly and he asked me if I wanted to join him for a coffee (we ran into one another on the street in front of a coffee house) I agreed and we talked for about an hour.
"Sure! 
A lot of the time we’ve spent in bed has been focused on ‘foreplay’ type things, more oral, more touching, more massage. Loads of dirty talk. Because our sex isn’t focused on penetrative sex, a sex ‘session’ can often last a few hours. Also, sex isn’t over just because he cums, we’ll often carry on until I have a second orgasm. Additionally, it’s not uncommon for him to cum and then after not very long be ready for more stimulation and have another orgasm soon after. He’s also vocal and noisy. Honestly one of my least favourite things about having sex with men has always been how quiet they are, I like to know that someone likes what I’m doing. 
These things are things that I associate with having sex with women but aren’t exclusive to lesbian sex.  I also want to point out that I’ve had some awesome sex with guys and some terrible sex with girls, so every experience is individual."

Long scalding showers and suffering in silence.
"I used to lobby periodically for a health care organization. It was somewhat rare for the House/Senate members themselves to meet with us, unless we had constituents and it was a good photo op situation.  
So one day I was with a delegation from Kentucky, and Mitch McConnell put in an appearance. This was 7-8 years ago, before I knew as much about how awful he is, and he absolutely radiated evil. You know when they say someone sucks the air out of a room? He did that.  
He asked me directly if I wanted to be in the photo, and I politely declined, because I didn’t even want to be that close to him."

"There was a kid I had classes with in middle school. Everyone just had a bit of an uneasy feeling about him. He was the “weird kid” (middle schoolers are judgmental assholes) but he also had a temper and all around made people nervous. As bad as it sounds my mom and I always say there are some people that just give you chills because they seem like the person that may snap and do something bad at any moment. That was this kid. Anyway, fast forward to 10th grade (15-16 years old) and he had dropped out, living with his girlfriend and her family. His girlfriend tried to break it off and he locked her in the house and caught it on fire:-(  Luckily, her mom happened to come home and she was able to get out of the house. Traumatic. 
Another guy I went to high school with made me nervous and I had a bad feeling around him but he was decently popular and no one else seemed to feel that way. I knew he objectified women pretty badly and was not always making the best decisions but while everyone else blamed it on typical teenage boy behavior I couldn’t shake that thought of “I’m going to see him on the news”. Once again, my gut was right because he beat his girlfriend to a pulp with a hammer a few years later. She lived, thank God."
"I stole daffodils outside someone’s property to give to my friend to thank him for hosting a get together at his place...drunk of course, also I gave him an empty salt packet I found on the street because I loved that salt brand and thought he’d appreciate. Like the human equivalent of an annoying pet cat."

"Oh man my sister should read this. It never occurred to me that financial abuse is totally a thing but that’s definitely what her husband is doing. She wants out but they have 6 kids, he makes way more money than her yet most of her money goes towards paying for food, clothes, school tuition and doctors appointments for the kids. He doesn’t want a divorce (he’s a super conservative Christian who’s controlling/emotionally abusive) but with her income and how much he makes her pay for stuff, at this rate she won’t be able to afford to move out. 

Thanks for sharing! You did something that took so much strength and patience to overcome, you should definitely be proud of that!"

"Rejection and being chronically single. I didn't manage to lose my virginity until I was 25, and no, there was no one for me to choose from. And no, I'm not even close to overweight."

"Traveling by myself. Go hiking and leave my car without worrying about it being broken into. Not worry about being robbed or kidnapped. Being able to talk to anyone and look them in the eyes.

I knew a woman who in the 70s traveled through Europe hitchhiking on her own. Not sure if its more or less dangerous today, but I can't imagine having the guts to do that."
"I got that recently for a colleague in my industry. Not a chilling/killer kind of effect, but a pit-in-my-stomach something is wrong with this man kind of feeling.  
  
Here's the thing: this man is adored in my field of work. He is cited enthusiastically all the time, is an accomplished author and founded his own company. He even heads a non-profit that does amazing work.  
  
But the one time I first saw him in person, I froze. I felt that ""something's wrong with this person"" kind of feel. It didn't help that I'd catch him staring at me from across the room a few times, and it's that stare that I couldn't shake off. Although I'd catch him staring at me, he never came to introduce himself, nor did I. 
  
I then started to notice how he'd adamantly hound one of my colleagues to come work for him. But he'd especially like to do it in very public situations, like on a stage where everyone is looking, and he'd spread the compliments really thick. She had said no to his offer many times, but it didn't matter. Still put her on the spot.  
  
Well, later that day I'm having drinks and bonding with one of his ex-employees. Turns out she quit pretty fast because he had a sexual inclination for people who fit her description. She told me about his inappropriate comments and behavior, not just with her, but with another employee that also fits her description (he has a fetish for a specific type of women).  
  
Here's the thing: he is so adored. God forbid more women have stories like his ex-employee, to report it or come public would be career suicide. And as someone who's both reported and chose not to report at times, I don't think it will do much in my industry."
"Men : more emotional labour, they expect to be coddled, disappointing in bed 8/10 times, i’m a lot more closed off emotionally since they’re exhaustive. 

women : super intense romances, hard and fast, better at showing love, way too much miscommunication sometimes though, things can get too demanding, heartbreak resounds 100x more"
Honestly when I realized my looks could only get me so far I began to use drugs. Took me five years of addiction and homelessness to come out of it. I’m five years sober now ❤️
"I kind of use the term friends a bit loosely here. 

I do want to get to know them first as a person (aka a “friend”). Before anything ever happens or pans out. I also am slow to like. I take a long time to like someone. So I guess it just becomes a cause and effect to a degree. Cause in order for me to deeply fall I need to feel a deep connection. 

However, why I used the quotations is because I need to still consider them a potential. Once I’ve locked someone in the friend group (purely platonic) I can’t really get out of it. So while they’re my friends .. because we are nothing else.. I need to feel or see them as someone who could be a maybe - yet keeping them and treating them as a friend would."
"Years ago a friend of mine did something similar - she said if we ended up with a Tory Prime Minister she was leaving the country. Cameron was elected, and so she moved to Nigeria and started teaching out there."
"Honestly, it's lonely. lol.
Girls are mean as fuck. 
Guys are only interested in you because they want one thing.

So you're stuck. You're alone. And the only way I got to move forward was because I didn't have a social life. I just went to school, did my homework during lunch (I didn't have friends so I went to the library). 

When I came home, I normally would study my French &amp; whatever subject I needed to review. I'd distract myself with the internet or tv shows, or videogames. 

And repeat.
Sometimes, I'd even get pushed in the hallway because people wanted to just get a reaction out of me. I'd go home crying sometimes because it gets to you. 

Especially if you're nothing but kind to everyone.
I was never considered ""hot"", just ""cute"" . I'm petite &amp; pretty so I was automatically a target. Especially from the taller girls."
"I really wanted to get the seventh Harry Potter book right at midnight, but my mom didn’t want to stay up and drive that late so she offered to go the next morning right when the store opened. 

I snuck out of the house, stole her car, drove it when I only had a permit, and stayed out past curfew to go buy that book. It was the first and only time I was that naughty as a kid. 

When she came in my room to wake me up I was passed mid-page. My mom is usually the type to punish immediately for anything moderately bad, but I wasn’t punished at all for clearly disobeying her and breaking many rules. Recently she told me that it both amused her and touched her that I was such a nerd to do all that for a book (vs a boy, party, or hanging out with bad influences)."
Go back to school. I’m afraid of accumulating more debt 😭

"yes when i was a decedent removal technician. i was dropping a stiff off at the coroner and went into the ""fridge"" where all the bodies are prior to being autopsied or sent to labs or sent to funeral home. basically a big staging area for the stiffs to hang out. usually (actually) a pretty chill place and the coroners and staff are pretty light humored sometimes asking if anyone wants anything from taco bell or coffee (""no? no one? ok guys see ya later!"") you get the idea. despite it being a traditionally creepy place it's not normally something that gives me the willies. Either way, i dropped this lady off and was wheeling her over to the cabinets. something just felt \*wrong\*. Like it was extra cold in a certain area. I walked around to all the different bodies and one in particular creeped me the F out bigtime. I remember by dad (he was on my team) pointing at him and saying ""it's you. you're what's in here thats.. wrong"" or something similar. I definitely remember the pointing.

"My situation was slightly different, as it's more about leaving above parents instead of a partner, but the concept is the same.

I was 20, and I had secretly started to save money in an account my parents didn't know about. I decided to save at least the equivalent of rent each month to see if I could afford to live on my own, and to build an emergency fund. During this time, I happened to visit an aunt that somehow intuited how depressed and desperate for escape I was, and she found an opportunity to talk to me alone and told me that if I wanted out, I could live with her as long as I needed to get on my feet. I owe her my life.

I slowly started sneaking things to the trunk of my car every morning I drove to work. The plan was finally hatched when my car had some problems, and coincidentally my aunt lived very close to the mechanic my family used. I told my parents I'd stay with my aunt while my car was being fixed, and I packed and headed over there. Once the repairs were done, I called my dad and told him I wasn't coming back.

That was just the start of weeks of guilt tripping, manipulation, and coercion, trying to get me back. They even showed up to my aunt's house while she was gone and tried to forcibly take me back. But my aunt was my rock and kept me from going back.

In short, my advice for someone trying to get out is to save money hidden somewhere if you can, and reach out to people for help. Even people you cut off before, especially people your partner made you cut off. Many times, these people saw through the abuse, and are waiting and hoping to hear from you that you saw the truth and want out."
"I replied to a similar post about this yesterday but long story short...Why would you want to settle and be with someone just because you consider being alone scarier than being with someone who doesn’t fulfill you?

Being lonely with a partner is lonelier than actually being alone. When you’re single you can work on yourself and look inward at what you truly want, and find someone who can appreciate you and fulfill you emotionally and offer you more than what you can offer yourself. 

That’s not what life is all about, finding “the one”. Life is about being happy! Be a good person, do things for yourself and be confident in yourself and the fact that being alone doesn’t mean you have to be lonely! Find what makes you happy and then go out and do it, and the kind of people you want to be around will be drawn to you."
"I chopped off my hair sophomore year before moving to a new school because I was trying to figure myself out through my parents divorce/the move.

I wore baggy clothes because I was insecure with my body/had an eating disorder.

I was often called dyke and queer bait by a kid on the football team. Though I did have quite a few people that would try to go on dates with me (confusing to me).

 Now my hair has grown long, I wear clothing that is appropriate for my body type and lose weight heathy. I feel 100x more attractive now.

But high school is a rough time especially with hormones etc. so it could just be everything made me feel unattractive when really I was decent."
"Lectured an entire train car because every seat was taken and nobody would stand up for the pregnant woman who was holding a toddler.

Ouch. This hurts to read. I’m just kinda at a loss for words.
"I have never had a woman be interested in anything like spitting on me or choking me, or penetrating me so hard it hurts*. As a matter of fact, with women partners I felt comfortable saying that I didn’t want to be penetrated but I was interested in X and Y, and maybe we could try Z? There was a lot of communication like “faster or slower” or “is that okay?”  I don’t know, I just felt like my women partners cared about me orgasming.

With men, first of all, pussy eating is only given as the beginning of a sexual encounter or as a quid pro quo for a blow job.  There was no orgasm just for the sake of giving me pleasure. Sex wasn’t over until he ejaculated. I have had two good male partners and what made them good was that they really, really loved women."

They've been together for over three decades now, there are still some comments about Jane being with him for his money, now that he is rich."

- I feel like a creep if I walk behind a woman OR man at anytime on a empty street. I'm just a small woman, but when I see a man turn around and see me behind him I'm thinking ""oh God I hope he doesn't think I'm following him"" then I change my path."
"You’re not an anomaly. Most women have healthy female friendships. 

Most of the people who think they don’t exist think that because they’re sexist. And honestly, I hear sometimes hear it from women who are very difficult to get along with and choose to blame others for their inability to develop friendships with other women."
"To me it happened the other way around. When I was a teen, I asked one of my friends if he wanted to go see a movie with me. He said yes, so I dolled myself up and waited at the cinema. He showed up with his best friend. So I thought okay, this was obviously a misunderstanding, doesn't matter, I'll suggest watching a horror film and hold his hand during the movie. The first scary scene comes up and I grab his hand. He takes my hand, leans in to whisper in my ear and says.. ""I think you should also hold (friend's) hand. He gets really scared at horror movies"".
So I grit my teeth and took the other friend's hand too and just resigned. Years later I met up with someone else from that friend group and I told him that story and he begins to laugh like a maniac. Turns out the guy that I had asked out had had a crush on me too but was just super oblivious."
"I'm a caretaker in a hospital who also does a few hours in a convenience store in the evening. This is where I met 'Her', she was a client and immediately, I thought the way she was looking at me was strange. She ordered a few things and after I got them, she suddenly pretended that she had asked for a hot coffee, not an iced one. That was very strange because I use to repeat each order to be sure there isn't any mistake. But well, you never know, so I apologize and can't help but notice that she looks like she is taking *pleasure* from having cornered me. 

Three days later, she is back, her eyes look positively gleaming and instinctively I decide that I'd better be extra careful, so I repeat each of her orders a little louder than I do. The staff at my side looks surprised but says nothing. And She does it again. She 'didn't tell me to heat her pasta up' (of course she did!) and this time too the item will have to be discarded, which means I will have to explain what happened to my manager once again.

Note that I'm a foreigner in an asian country. Till now there had been no language barrier, so the fact that it seems it's the second time is one, is even harder to swallow for me.

Fortunately for me, the staff who was at the next cashier will take my side and explain that I didn't make any error.

Fast forward 3 months later. I quit the convenience store for a Mc Donalds that is way closer to my place, and here she comes again! This time she starts by 'evaluating' me from head to toes, like she is seeing some prey. I'm not kidding, she had that hungry look and I realize she is going to do it again because she is walking straight to my cashier among all the others. I pretend I'm not feeling well and ask a colleague to replace me while I go to the toilet.

Fast forward 5 months later. On TV the news are all about that university student who has  lured a 'friend' at home, killed, dissected and cut her in pieces because she wanted to see 'how a human being is inside'. Her photo gets leaked on the Net. It's Her."
"I'm going to try this the next time I'm dealing with my anxiety. My partner often feels like I'm a different person once I've succumb to it because I tend to cycle through negative thoughts on rapid fire.

This might be a good way to break the spinning wheel and identify what's actually bothering me"
"Whenever someone asks for a 3rd part's number, I say, ""I can't give that to you, but if you give me your number, I'll make sure they get it."" In this case though, it seems like that might have been a bad idea, and he might have become even more obsessed."
"Planned and saved cash I slowly set aside for months in sock in my sock drawer (I made sure to stay on top of keeping laundry done to keep the drawer full, less chance of it being discovered) 

I played it cool for the week leading up and just tried to make him as happy as possible without being too suspicious.

Then I waited until he was on duty for his shift, packed my car, left him a note, and left. I called my family from the road to tell them i was coming and what the situation was. I couldn't fit everything in my car and ended up leaving a lot behind, never got any of it back of course. His CO's wife even called me to convince me to come back and try therapy, I refused"
"When I was 15, my mom was going through chemo in a city about 4 hours from where we lived, so when she had to get her treatment every other Friday, we would all go together and make a trip out of it during the summer (during the school year I stayed the night before with a friend so I could get to school).

On one of these trips, an old work colleague of my dad's met up with us. I was sitting in the waiting room waiting for my parents, just reading a book when he sat down next to me and started chatting with me. He didn't say who he was just started talking with me and he kept leaning in toward me while he talked making me very uncomfortable. I was as polite as I could be, but I just was super uneasy around him. My mom and dad finally came out and my dad greated him and it was only then that he introduced himself. Idk if he knew that I was my dad's daughter before that or if he just saw a young girl in the waiting room and decided it was appropriate to talk to her.

We all went to Olive Garden and he offered to pay for all of us even though mom didn't eat much from the chemo. I thought I was just overthinking everything and my mom and dad didn't seem to think anything was off, but my dad had known him for years and my mom was both very sick and her brain was a bit oxygen deprived. While eating, he asks me if I have a boyfriend, what kind of exra curriculars I do, and then asks what my blood type is. I just said I didn't know and my mom, being the angel she was, says she thought I was AB. He then says, ""Really, me too. I've heard type ABs are almost always attracted to one another."" I was so ready for that lunch to be over at that point. We left and we never saw him again.

About 2 years ago, I asked my dad about him and he told the me that the man had cheated on his wife with a teenage girl who was about 14. Idk if he ever faced any charges for it. I don't know if it qualifies as pure evil, but he was definitely a creeper with an affinity for underage girls."
"PLEASE take more responsibility for your drunk/high friends when they’re trying to hit on a woman who has already shown she’s not interested. A number of times I’ve ‘jokingly’ called these guys out, and even then it was a chore to get them to drag their friend away or intervene because “he’s harmless he’s not hurting anybody.” Maybe not, but this big guy who smells of beer is telling me how lonely he is and is breathing down my neck while I’m ordering a drink, and won’t stop insisting that I join him at his table despite me telling him I’ve got a bf and I’m not interested. That doesn’t scream harmless to me."
"So, I moved back to my hometown a few years  ago and hung out with old friends and was introduced to mutual friends. My friend’s friend, “Marc” and I hit it off and became friends. I was seeing Someone at the time (my now husband) and he knew that. He asked me if I wanted to grab lunch and I said sure. I grab lunch/breakfast with my dude friends all the time- They’ve known me since high school and would never try anything. No big deal. Well, he picks me up and we go to this bougie burger place and we have friendly conversation. The check comes while I was in the bathroom and he pays for lunch. I immediately started venmoing money to him but he declines. Okay. Weird for me but I let it go. He takes me to a donut place and coffee after. He pays again. It makes me uncomfortable. We go for a walk and the conversation starts to turn more personal and I’m not about that. So I tell him I have to go home. He drives me home and tries to give me a hug and I just gave him a high 5! He looked at me dumbfounded. Few days later I see my friends and tell them what happened. They said Marc has done things like that a few times with girls he’s interested in. Ask them to hang out and then turns it into a date. And! He’s even done that with ladies that are in a relationship. Needless to say, I haven’t hung out with him alone since. I see if every now and then but I’m not as friendly as I once was. He crossed the line with me."
"Haha this is one of my favorites. On weekends when my wife and I are getting ready to go somewhere like to the store or to visit my parents we have the same conversation: ""Are you putting on makeup?"" ""No."" ""Me neither."" It's such a relief to not have that expectation of looking 100% put together when you leave the house because your partner understands the desire to minimize the effort you put into appearance whenever possible whereas with men, they don't really seem to have to put different levels of effort in apart from just wearing more professional clothing to work."
"Yeah, I've gotten that too. Most of the time, I prefer the emotional support because 9 times out of 10, I've already considered the practical solutions that men offer or their solutions aren't appropriate for the situation. If I need help with something, I'll ask, I don't really need men swooping in and telling me how to fix my own problems. If Steve from Accounts made a comment that rubbed me the wrong way, I'd much prefer a ""I'm sorry, what a rude thing to say"" as opposed to ""Well, you should have said this/done that"". Sometimes, I just want to get shit off my chest."

"I remember when I was in highschool my brother told me to befriend the hottest girl because they never have any real friends, and it'd be my best ""in"" to get a date with her or one of her friends.

She's been my best friend for the past 10 years, it was honestly heartbreaking to realise that among her friend group I was the only one that still spoke to her after she got married and had a kid.

I couldn't have asked for a better friend and it blows my mind that nobody ever truly took the time to get to know her."
There you go.
"This is either a budding serial killer or someone so out of touch with social norms that they don’t realize how scary they’re being, and are fixated on how this wasn’t the way it played out in their head, ie, genuinely confused.  Either way, not a good look!"
"In high school my Biology teacher gave me the absolute creeps. He was just too flirty, and other girls said that he always insisted on giving athletic massages. I wouldn’t ever let him touch me and even in class I’d ninja doge if I had to and just keep a desk between us. Even with all that if I asked a question he’d walk over and put his hand on my shoulder. I never told anyone, but he was later arrested for sending dirty letters and lingerie to one of my classmates. 

Same year, a classmate in another class just gave off the darkest vibes I’ve ever felt even to this day (17 years later). He was arrested for murdering his gf over winter break."
"Food. I like traveling because even if you live in a pretty diverse city, there's still other foods you can't get where you live.

Also, physically going to see some pretty sights that are way more amazing in-person. This one isn't far from home, but I went to a pretty big church when I was younger. It's 3 stories high. The view from the top when it was Autumn was one of the most amazing things. A snap from my phone couldn't have done it any justice."
I’ve dealt with passive suicide ideation since I was 12 so any thoughts related to that.

"I think a lot of my experiences reflect not any sort of truth about men or women as a whole, but who I am as a person and how others relate to me.

I'm what many would describe as ""masculine"".  I could go on a whole rant about gender roles and nothing being inherently masculine or feminine and I'd use the word ""butch"" but I'm not allowed because I'm bisexual, but let's just say people ask me what my pronouns are but they don't ask my wife.  I have won world championships in the bench press, I coach a roller derby league, I am good at powertools and DIY, I'm a software engineer.  Like my father, and every engineer you know, I can not handle being talked down to or condescended to about something I'm very good at or knowledgeable in, especially if the person condescending to me knows less than I do.  I have never, ever, in the history of my life, met a single man who didn't condescend to me about either lifting heavy objects or software engineering at least occasionally.  Usually they're good about being chill about one, they're cool dating a chick who's stronger than them as long as they're the smart one, or vice versa.  But even among the best of them, they were grudgingly accepting and had weird feelings about the qualities in me that I'm most proud of.  Women on the other hand don't have the same hangups because they aren't socialized usually to feel shame for not being He-Man.  Every woman I've ever dated has been chill with being the expert in things she's good at, and letting me be the expert in my zones of expertise.

Also, I'm one of those aggressively validating people who can't turn off my need to be really nice to everybody around me.  I'm happiest when I'm looking out for my friends and family and thinking of nice things to do for them and preempting their needs, and they do the same for me.  Women tend to be real good at that, or at least they can recognize when I'm more giving than they are, that makes them uncomfortable, and they ask me to dial back.  Men are more likely to have an attitude of ""I'm just going to do what makes me happy and comfortable and if you have a problem with it it's on you to speak up about it.""  That type of attitude works great when both people are like that, but in practice, it results in my kindness getting constantly taken advantage of, or feeling like I have to constantly go to battle asking specifically for what I need.

Plus they tend to think of touching the clitoris as foreplay, and not, like, the primary source of sexual pleasure for most women.  Some chicks can get off on the amount of penetration that most dudes are into.  But for me, trying to get off from sex with most dudes is like if I were to try jacking them off by rubbing their balls.

Nothing wrong with dudes.  They're just completely wrong for me."
This is fucking terrifying.
"There was a thread on this sub recently discussing sex and there was a man defending the fact that men consider their orgasm as the end of sex by saying ""After orgasm we get really tired and aren't aroused anymore.""

&amp;#x200B;

It seemed to blow a few male minds when it was pointed out that this wasn't a male-only experience, that women get post-orgasm sleepiness and drop-off in arousal too. Weirdly, it's not an excuse to leave them frustrated when it happens to us."
"Idk if it was a direct causation, but one of my college friends moved to Canada after Trump was elected. Part of it was she met an Irish guy while studying abroad and they wanted to be together. He got a Canadian visa so now they live together in Toronto.

I’m sure there were multiple factors at play, but I know that the Trump presidency made the decision easier for her at least."
Pull back on extra responsibilities. Focus on mindfulness. Drink less caffeine. Talk to people in my support network. Try to get more exercise.

"Yep, I used to work for a lawyer and from the moment one of the clients came in I could tell there was something off about him. He just seemed...dangerous. I’d never had that with other clients even when they were throwing fits. This guy just walks into the room and freaks me out. Turns out the other secretary, who’d been there way long than I had, felt the same way about him. I can’t say details but a quick glance through his legal history proved me right."

I’m glad that situation didn’t escalate any further. That is terrifying. I am thinking I need to take some self defense classes or something because I find myself not doing things alone and being very fearful/anticipating this sort of situation. I’m very passive and shy so I do not know what I would do. Sorry you had to experience this.
"With men, it’s always been 0-100 and some have asked me repeatedly to do things I’ve already declined to do, and would not stop until I relented. Blowjobs are pretty much always assumed, either to start or finish.    

With women, it has generally been much more of a slow burn and nothing has ever been assumed."

"I always try to take a self-care day. I'll take a day off work, take a long shower/bath, paint my nails, do a face mask, spend tons of time with my cats, go see a movie with a giant thing of popcorn, listen to music that makes me happy. Then, when I get home, I take time to feel whatever it is I'm feeling coming on. It tends to be anxiety for me, so I let that in for a little bit, have a good cry if I need to, sit under my weighted blanket. Allow myself to feel it, then move on. Acknowledging it but not dwelling seems to help me a lot. Then drink tons of water, eat something good for dinner, and pass out at an early time while watching something I love."
"I come from South Africa but currently live in Germany so I'll share a bit from both places

1. South Africa
-Many black men are extremely misogynistic, I fortunately grew up in a big city but and had more opportunities but even there we have extremely high rape and abuse, and in more rural /underdeveloped areas its often hushed by elder women as a natural part of life. There's been a strong women's movement here for many decades but the problems are still terrible. In 'homelands' many rulers are awful and refuse women equal access to housing and land without their father's or husband's permission.
- There is a lot of racial tension. It seems as though people don't like anyone else (blacks, whites, Indians, Coloureds, Asians, etc.) we are pretty diverse but live out-of-harmony. A lot to do with how teh government tried to ""wipe the slate clean"" after Apartheid, there's still a lot of resentment and behaviours and attitudes that haven't been changed.
- Not being able to succeed without English or Afrikaans. We have 11 official languages (and many more are spoken throughout) but we are forced to conform to Western ideals to even study at university. In turn, African languages are seen as less valuable and no care is put into learning these languages by non-blacks, even though it would help to communicate with the majority of the country. Also you get told off about speaking your native language by people who've never even tried to learn because you aren't including them and could be talking shit
- Lots of stereotypes about crime, stupidity, disease


Germany (though I've only been here for 2 months) 
- racism. Bluntly, people often speak of the racism in the USA but I think that's because it's often loud, but in many parts of Europe (especially in recent times because of immigration) there is a lot of hate for black people. You are constantly stared at, followed around shops, spoken about (they assume you don't understand). There is a lot of anger because immigrants are supposedly taking their jobs, bringing crime, etc. Don't forget your entire economy would collapse if France stopped exploiting former colonies (this exploitation being part of why so many people leave their countries) 
- also racism, but a different kind - fetishisation."
"I know I don't have enough information to really judge, but I hear ""kid has a list of people he wants to kill, gets expelled,"" and shake my head...I really hope there was more corrective action taken (such as counseling at the bare minimum) to get an obviously troubled kid the help he needs.  Obviously the kid was fucked up to begin with, but if ALL they did was expel him, they and his parents are just as at fault for his future crimes than he himself is.  

I'm so sorry you had to deal with that, kudos to your big sister, I hope that a scary experience like that didn't affect you in any lasting way."
"Thank you. That never occurred to me.

I'm happy now.  It's been 6 years and I'm still grateful every morning when I wake up."

Anywho he turned out to be a toxic person so my gut was right"
"It's funny too how men online will be describing what their thoughts are like in response to ""what are you thinking about?"" like they're random, unique weirdness about pop culture, meaningless quirky fun stuff, and it's not like we don't have those thoughts also?"
"Society is fucked up about how men and women are allowed to express negative emotions. Men are pressured out of expressing sorrow and women are pressured out of expressing anger. It's not like you can erase either emotion out of existence through shame, peer pressure and overreacting whenever they express the *wrong* emotion. Instead, you tend to get men expressing their sadness in the form of anger and women expressing their anger in the form of sadness. The end result is that the pain they are expressing and circumstances leading to that pain aren't taken seriously because of the delivery, they are instead reduced down to sexist caricatured gender stereotypes. It's unhealthy and alienating.

I'm not saying the solution is unmitigated outrage and tears, that wouldn't be healthy either. Only, that life can be shitty sometimes and not be socially permitted to express certain emotions in circumstances where those feelings are a normal and understandable outcome is not healthy."
"I have a hard time deciding whether this guy was evil or just disturbed.

About a year ago I went on a really uncomfortable Tinder date that resulted in an assault. I started talking to this guy who by all accounts seemed fairly normal. He was really cute, had kind of a rugged boy band look with tattoos and really nice blue eyes. Conversation was normal, talked about music and art a lot. He asked me if he could take me out and I accepted. 

From the moment I got in the car i felt a little bit nervous, he was exactly the same to his photos, a very attractive and fit guy... but the smile he gave me when I got in the car was a little predatory and I can't explain what it was but he would look at me with this weird ""hungry"" look on his face. We went to an art exhibit and to be honest, my fears began to dispel. He seemed nice, and interesting, and we laughed a bit about some of the ridiculous exhibits... and pretended a thread on the floor was an art installation to see how many people gathered around us to view it.

It turned out to be a decent date. At least thats what I was thinking as we walked back to his car.

However, after we got into his vehicle and began driving, he immediately lit a joint, it was the dead of winter, and even though weed is legal it's still obviously very much illegal to drive while high, I lightly suggested he take me home when he ignored my concerned question about him smoking and driving. He ignored that too and said 

""Naw, lets head up to the viewpoint over there where it overlooks the city""

Fuck. I thought, how do i get out of this.

 So starting to feel a little trapped in his car, we went up to a secluded part of the city and to my horror there were absolutely no other vehicles there. My purse was lying between us and he pushed it off the console and into the backseat. My hairs stood up on end. We sat there for a bit making small talk, and then he asked me about my sexual prefrences, to which i said ""i dont really... disclose.... that stuff on a first date tbh"". Suddenly he reached over and grabbed my knee

""You look SO innocent, i love it""

Wtf. Ok. I smiled awkwardly. 

Then he proceeded to tell me about how he can only get off by choking his partner into unconsciousness, saying the excitement and tension from them waking up again mid-intercourse was extremely satisfying for him. I mean, by this time I had a bouquet of red flags literally handed to me, and I was growing more scared of him by the minute... but i didn't know how to get him to take me home. I thought that if i freaked out or told him off in some way, it would be a bad situation considering we were sitting isolated in an empty park. I was clammy and nervous and he kept reaching over to touch my knee and stroke my shoulder. Eventually i worked up the courage to reach over and grab my bag.

""i really REALLY need to get home, I have to be somewhere at 3"" I tell him firmly.

Grudgingly, he finally backs out of the parking lot to drive me back. Im kicking myself for letting him pick me up. What the hell is wrong with me, now this psycho knows where i live.

As we approach the parking lot to my building I unbuckle myself gently so i can make a quick escape. He pulls up outside the doors to my building and i say ""thanks"" not even bothering to stick around for the ""im not interested"" conversation, I just wanted OUT of that car RIGHT NOW.

As i pulled the door handle i felt a hand on the scruff of my neck and my head was yanked back and he literally shoved his tongue in my mouth and pushed his other hand up my dress

""WTF!?!"" I say, this time losing my temper completely and shoving him away.

He doesn't even break, just grins and says 

""You are seriously such a tease"" It was like looking into the eyes of a complete emotionless robot. He had absolutely no recognition about what he had just done. I felt completely and utterly violated, and to make matters worse, there was not a soul around to witness it and tears were springing to my eyes.

I jumped out of the car and slammed the door shut, running into the lobby of my building, barely able to punch in the code I was shaking so bad with anger. Then i proceeded to throw up in the planter outside the elevator. After doing a google search about filing a report against him, I felt silly because I hadn't been physically raped and never did anything about it because I didn't know what my options were. It haunted me for a while.

98% of my dates have been with nice normal men, but this one really took the cake. From that point on I've never been able to accept a ride from a guy on a first date. Sometimes we forget the potential for evil out there, or straight up psychopathy and narcissism."
"Yes, and oh god, it was bad. 

This was someone I worked with in a limited capacity, but he always went above and beyond to make my life easier. We always had gotten along well enough, he never seemed flirty or creepy, and he knew I was married. So, one day when he once again went above and beyond to make my life easier, I asked if I could buy him lunch as a thank you.

Well, he thought it was a date. And on this “date” he confessed to being a convicted rapist. And explaining in painful detail what exactly happened, backstory and all, how he got caught, etc. But you guys! It wasn’t his fault! Because she was a witch and her coven plotted against him! Oh, and he also talked about how angry it made him that people judged him based on his being a registered sex offender, how it has lost him friends/dates/jobs etc.

Lemme tell ya, I got A LOT better about locking my doors after that shit."
"When I was a very little kid (under 6) my grandma had a neighbor named Chris. Chris lived with his mom. He was probably in his early 20s. Chris eventually got married, and then divorced. I was scared shitless of Chris. I recently remembered that my mom said, more than once, that ""kids always know"" and would just right out tell me that I was right about him, but did not stop him or his mom from coming around. 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to look him up a few weeks ago because I randomly remembered him, his mom, and their last name. He has been in and out of prison for fraud, rape, assault, and drugs his entire life. Yep, pretty much right on the money there as a kid. Damn."

Women: ""You still fuck dudes...ewwwww."""
"There are differen't opinions on what exactly ""emotional labour"" entails. 

But I understand it this way: emotional labour is dealing with emotion, e.g. stress, sadness, anger, joy, etc. If one person is dealing with the majority of these feelings for both people in the relationship it can be very exhausting. 

Generally men tend to be worse at dealing with emotions. So some women experience that when they're in a relationship with a man they become both therapist and girlfriend. They're dealing with most of the emotional labour for both of them."
"A guy once asked me “why do you look like you hate the world?” I said without looking at him, “so people like you don’t talk to me.” 

Coolest thing I’ve ever done. And he never talked to me again."
"I have had men stand on their tip toes while talking to me because I’m tall, and they don’t want to have to look up to look me in the eye.

A lot of the time, they don’t even recognize that they’re doing it. It’s always hilarious, and definitely looks stupid."
"as someone who’s parents sometimes didn’t have enough money to afford lunch, that was really so sweet of you!"
"&gt;but men tend to view communication as commitment

Exactly this. In their mind it seems they equate talking about feelings/needs/wants with them being obligated to fulfill said feelings/needs/wants."
"I've dated women, men, and nonbinary people. Not too many differences. I find I am the person ""steering"" the relationship in almost all cases, just in different ways. Women want me to show my interest first, men expect me to tell them where the relationship is heading. I found my relationship with a nonbinary person somewhat more equal in this regard but my sample size is small. 

I often feel when I'm having casual sex with men that they view me as a ""type"" rather than a person. I have x hair color and y amount of curves, and that's who I am in their memory still. I feel I'm being related to on a more individual level with people of other genders.

However, I'm not into the way it's in vogue for bi and pan women to say they resent their attraction to men, women are so much better, etc. Sexism is what sucks, not men as a gender."
"Hair on your nipples. It's normal, most women have a few coming out of the areola. 

I literally thought I was a freak or had hormone issues until I was 20 and finally asked a doctor."
"Doctor who said it best when he was talking about the Vashta Nerada in the library ""not every shadow, but any shadow""...    In our case, ""not every man, but any man"" ... 

The all time best thing any man can do to help us is not stand for it, support a healthy treatment of women(even when women aren't around, their language is an indicator and precursor to the behavior). Raise your sons and nephews well. Be aware of what we are aware of every day, and try to see it from our point of view."
Basically this. The only thing I’d add is if there is a problem - but not an emotional problem - most guys will look for a practical solution. Most women will offer more emotional support (at least that’s the experiences I’ve had 🤷‍♀️).
"There are two instances: 

* Two people started as friends. Later down the line, they develop mutual attraction and interest, then decides to date and become SOs.
* Two people meet and develop mutual attraction and interest right off the bat. They decide to get to know each other, which you can call developing a friendship, start to date on a romantic level, then becomes SOs. In this case the relationship moves faster since they were interested in each other right away.

I would say being friends is part of the dating process. But it's like defining ""friendship"" as getting to know each other better. In this case, friendship would be a natural thing to form during the dating stage, before two people make their relationship official and/or commit."
Heheh... Had a one night stand tell me he didn't want to have sex with me again because I was so quiet. Which was caused by this exact thing.
"You have a Define the Relationship talk, where you tell them you'd like to be officially in a relationship and discuss what that means to both of you."
"I'm not even that pretty but the women I've dated have been more likely to parade me around like a trophy and praise me for being hot to the point I'm uncomfortable. Men are more likely to treat me like I'm not hot enough for them and quickly move on to someone hotter. 

Sex lasts longer with women and pretty much a guaranteed orgasm, usually more than one, whereas no guarantee with men. I prefer someone dominate and have to ask for it, and I usually prefer men's version of dominance to women's. 

I've found a mix of emotionally needy and emotionally distant in both groups. 

Women are more likely to put in the effort to try what I like and go places and do things I want, and men only want to do what they like, and often prefer to stay in and Netflix and chill."
"Apparently I'm in the minority here because I like using condoms. The ribbed ones help me get off, the fact the it desensitizes him"
"Just wanted to say, as a man, if you want to change, constantly think about this stuff. Keep present in your mind, all these things women are telling you and adjust your behavior in the world accordingly. It's like counting calories or doing a budget, making yourself confront the reality of the situation is half the battle. Because once you can see your own or others behavior for what it really is, it's easy to say 'hey thats wrong' and then not do it, you know, because it's wrong. It can be hard at first for some, but it eventually will just be second nature to be able to look at yourself from the woman's point of view in any given situation and then not do the creepy/intrusive/insulting/unwanted thing."
"Bold of you to assume we could afford a honey moon lol. But really, we ended up just staying a couple extra nights in the hotel where we got married. The night of our wedding, after the after party, we went back to our room, put on a documentary, sat on the floor and drunkenly ate the top layer of our wedding cake, together. It was the best honeymoon I could have ever asked for."
"High school wasn't bad, but middle school was a nightmare.

I'm still dealing with some issues that stem from the bullying back them.  And I'm still unattractive.  Oh well."
"This is both unsettling and comforting, oddly enough."
Sounds like a Nice Guy
"I wish more men would correct other men. Many guys I've talked to will admit that they dont like their friends behavior towards women, but they dont say anything!!

Cat calling, gaslighting, making cringy sex jokes towards a female, trying to guilt a woman to go somewhere or participate in something she isnt comfortable with. Acting passive agressive in response to something you didnt like. Most men I wouldnt say come across as ""predatory"" but I've had a few experiences that still give me goose bumps or make me sick to my stomach just thinking about them..... and has made me hyper aware of men who act predatory."
And once in awhile someone will unexpectedly walk down a hallway or something and catch me mouthing or making faces and then I look insane.
"Agree, “uptight” is another one they like to throw out"
"I think about that too. Especially in places like airports or concerts. Or on university campuses in the US that I travel to for work, sadly enough."
"&gt;just because we are ''irrational'' does not mean we are ''wrong'' and thus he is ''right''

Too many men use ""you are being irrational"" to mean ""I don't agree"". Just because a woman cares about something you don't care about, she's not ""irrational"". Just because a woman is bothered by something you aren't bothered by, she's not ""irrational"". Just because a woman wants something you don't want, she is not ""irrational"".

Women being ""irrational"" has been used since the fucking dawn of time to basically brush off their needs, wants, and preferences because it makes men's lives easier."
"Being outside on the first Autumn day that's actually cool enough to need long sleeves. Everything feels different, looks different, smells different- it's crisp and vibrant. Coffee even tastes better."
"I will probably delete this later, but in middle school I was chubby, with acne and frizzy hair and I didn't know how to put on makeup. On top of that my family was very poor so I had only old hand me down clothes that weren't in fashion by any means of the imagination. well, you can imagine the bullying. One low point was when the boys in my class ranked all the girls by how attractive we were, and they came up to and told me I was the ugliest girl in the class and laughed in my face and wouldn't stop bringing it up later. Even my friends would not defend me because it was the popular boys doing it and they didn't want to seem ""uncool"", to the point people stopped being friends with me because they didn't want to associate with me. It hurt a lot, and on top of that my father had cancer and was going through chemo and in my other house hold my step father was very abusive. It was an awful period of my life and once I got to high school I was so relieved that no one knew who I was, but I was too afraid to open up to anyone for fear of bullying again, plus I had no confidence to speak of so I didn't make a single friend, I was just a loner. As an adult I still have no confidence really, I dress well, I wear makeup, I get compliments and guys staring at me. But if one asks me out I will always reject them. I just don't love myself at all and I don't feel like I'll ever be in a healthy position where I can love someone else too. I will always feel like they are settling and would be so much happier with someone else because I feel so disgusting and unattractive."
"But don't you know? The life of a woman is waltzing around collecting free drinks and, eventually, child support!  

Women* never face rejection of any kind! 


Where woman is defined as an extremely narrow subset of young, straight women aged 16-24 who are naturally beautiful with stylish clothing and a wonderfully proportioned shapely figure, and who aren't too tall to be intimidating, and who are confident and outgoing/extroverted. 

All other members of the female gender who do not fit this incredibly narrow definition of ""women"" are not actually women! There, see, I have proved that the life of a woman is easy and they just sit around collecting free shit all day and never facing rejection!"
"Some friend of a friend had a spare festival ticket to a metal show. He told me it was cool, he didn't want any money for it, because apparently he wouldn't have been able to sell it anymore anyway. Since I was only 17 at the time he told me he'd pick me up cause he had to drive there anyway, so why not. He didn't flirt or anything even remotely like that. No touching, no asking if I'm single, no nothing. Just sone metal and YouTube talk. 

Well, I went with hin, watched a few concerts together until I met a friend of mine whom I had a huge crush on. I didn't think it was a big deal, so I hung out with him a bit, made out and all that teen festival stuff.

Well apparently it WAS a big deal because the first guy basically kicked me out and I had to move over to the second guy's tent and drive home with him. First guy STILL calls me the ""biggest b-word to ever exist"". Well how the fuck should I have known? I was a fucking naive teen and even niw I doubt I would've realized he was ""deeply in love"" with me, though obviously I wouldn't go to a festival with a strange dude anymore."
I came to say this.   Nighttime walks are so serence.   Usually no one is out and it's so peaceful and cool.
"This. I am soooo much more relaxed (and therefore having more fun and being more open) when a man has a condom on. I'll admit I've been irresponsible a few times in my life and gone with out a condom, but it wasn't worth the worry. I also notice a generational difference. By that I mean men in their mid-50's and older don't feel the need to wear them, if they feel you are ""clean"" and they trust their ability to pull out when orgasaming. I believe this is because for them growing up AIDS / HIV wasn't a huge issue yet, most STD's were less common and treatable. They weren't scared to death by AIDS / HIV and pregnancy warnings like younger generations were. I remember in school in the mid-late 80's  learning about AIDS / HIV, and how condoms were mandatory, no way around it. I was sexually active in my early teens and we just KNEW you had to use comdoms. So to me and GenX'ers like me condoms are a normal expected part of sex. I'm not sure about Millennials and such.  I'm 43 and all I know is most men my age wear condoms with out a fight.   Men older than me in their mid to late 50's and up, it's very often a fight, telling them they have to wear one because of STD's and pregnancy.  Also a lot of men older than me have been married for 20+ years so they didn't use condoms for most of their adult life, and now that HAVE TO wear one and ""boo hoo it doesn't feel as good with a condom, come on, I'm clean and you seem like a clean girl, I have very good self control, I can pull out for sure.""

&amp;#x200B;

Is it just me, or so other women experience this generational condom issue? Is it just US East coast?"
Getting rejected and judged on the size of your bodyparts...
"An equal partnership. A lot of women don't want to be taken care of or pampered; we just want to be on the same level as the person we're dating.

I'm a gearhead and love my car; I want to drive sometimes if we're going somewhere.

Unless you see me struggling or I ask for help, let me carry heavy stuff. I do it when you're not around.

Let's trade off cooking/cleaning responsibilities or paying for dinner."
"&gt; I often feel when I'm having casual sex with men that they view me as a ""type"" rather than a person. I have x hair color and y amount of curves, and that's who I am in their memory still.

I *definitely* feel this too. Sometimes with some men I get this frustrating feeling they're not interacting with me, they're interacting with this made up version of me they've assumed I am based on ideas about my features. Like I'm short and baby-faced, so I must be innocent and sweet. I'm a brunette so I must be bookish and smart. I'm bisexual so I must be somewhat emotionally unhinged and down for threesomes. There have been men who have known me for *years* who still project this stuff on to me, even though you would think they'd know by now who I actually am.

Example: I dated a guy who got me jewelry for my birthday after we'd been dating a year. I'd already mentioned in conversations prior that I hate jewelry and I never wear it, ever. I actually said, ""Thanks, it's beautiful but you know I don't wear jewelry, right?"" and he just stared at me blankly and said he thought I'd love it. Is it really so hard to interact with me, changhyun, instead of some faceless representative for the type of woman you believe me to be?"
"Yes, they went to New Zealand."
"Date. 
I have a lot of insecurities, fears, and I don't date because I fear that it'll just push a guy away. I just don't feel like I'm enough in any type of category. Y'know? 
Like I'm not pretty enough, smart enough, secure enough, funny enough, entertaining enough, serious enough, mature enough, financially stable enough, etc. 
So, I stay away. I don't talk to guys that often or I run whenever I get the indication that a guy is falling for me because I already know I'm going to fuck it up."
"I try to give people the benefit of the doubt, but a lot of the time with men I end up being disappointed (at best) in that they don't seem to care or respect that I'm not interested in them. My badge pull at work says ""I care for you like my... (husband, name). I had a few chats with a guy in another department and some of them included mentioning my then fiancé and talking about wedding stuff. Dude still got butthurt that I was ""leading him on"" by having friendly conversations with him and even told me he thought I made up my husband to try and keep guys away (clearly didn't work anyway). What!? 

Change happens slowly and internally so I would say the best thing guys can do is call out other guys on their shitty behavior, comments, ""jokes"", mindsets etc. Women being friendly or even neutral or even existing going about their business doesn't mean they are physically/romantically interested in you and a lot of guys (I'm sure also women but I have no experience with that) don't seem to realize this."
"Well it's not a *problem* but some see as such: alimony/child support. I'm speaking for Turkey but pretty sure it's similar in most other countries. If it's the woman who makes more money, then she pays child support to the man. The point is so the kids will have similar life standards in both homes. And if one side changed career plans because of the marriage, say the husband moved to a different city for the wife with a sacrifice of his own career, or left work, and then she files for divorce, he gets alimony unless there was a foul on his side (cheating, abuse, etc) It's the same the other way around. Of course it happens to men more but only because usually men make more money, not because the laws favor women."
"I heard my mom talking about how she wished she could afford a nice tennis bracelet. I was in like second grade at the time, and in class one day I saw that someone had left their bracelet under my desk. It had a tennis racket charm and in my mind I was like “oh my gosh it’s a tennis bracelet!” So I stole it and gave it to my mom."
Punch em in the face. Do it. Punch punch punch
"M.O. is one of those things I've always wanted to know what it meant, but always forgot to look up. Thanks for the explanation!"
My friends family  moved to New Zealand (from usa) during the iraq war. My friend was about to turn 18 and they where scared the draft was about to be reintroduced.
That is so uncool. So so uncool.
God. I made a friend who was really cool and also liked table top games and we used to hang on skype sometimes. THen when he was on about meeting up he kept mentioning sharing a hotel and...yeah.....no.
That sex is shameful and sex education is therefor bad.
"Until it starts to grow back. All that stubble between my cheeks.... it was like having diaper rash. I finally decided,  no more, and told my man to get used to my hairy asshole"
"I do the same thing! I know I won't get pregnant because of the IUD, but that doesn't mean I want an STI.

I've also found this is a great test for guys. If they pitch a fit about using one when all they know is I'm ""not on the pill"" I see that as a major red flag. If I can't trust you to do a small thing for my comfort and safety starting out then I probably won't trust you sexually ever."
It’s nice to hear that he handled it well. I’m also glad things worked out great for him in the end. This is the proof the guys on r/niceguys need to see every time they claim “nice guys finish last”
"He does, doesn’t he? But he totally wasn’t in any way, there were no red flags! He’s a paramedic, very “cool”, everyone loves him, he’s super non judgmental and sex positive, but then this weird Nice Guy character jumped out and ruined everything."
Still happens to attractive women too
Taking your bra off at the end of the day.
Yeah they moved on to Switzerland about 5 years ago.
"I'm just shocked setting here reading this. Between me and my best friend we have had 5 total creepy encounters with men that live on lakes. We joke about ""lake house guys"" ALL the time. I am sooo sorry you too had that experience, but at the same time I feel you're in our tribe, internet stranger!"
Or naked ghosts?
"One time I was at Walmart shopping with my boyfriend. We had a huge cart full of stuff and he needed paint or some other manly thing I really couldn’t give input on. So instead of lugging our cart I stayed out near the paint desk and was just scrolling on my phone for a second. Then some raggedy dude comes up to me, bug eyed, and says “wow you’re really pretty” but in a slow and malicious sounding way. He started inching closer to me. As soon I made eye contact with him my entire body was screaming at me to get out of the situation. I was frozen though and because my back was up against the counter my escape options were slim. LUCKILY just then my boyfriend cane up from the aisle. I looked back at my boyfriend and then when I went to turn back around to the creep he was GONE. My flight or fight response was still kicked in for some time afterwards and I was anxious the entire rest of the shopping trip. A little later on we see him again in a different aisle and then my boyfriend goes “oh! I know that guy. He’s well known for acting like he’s injured or has a broken down car and then robs people.” I still get a weird vibe when I think of the situation."
"Exactly. Part of the reason women viewed as inferior to men is because we're stereotyped as being too emotional. Just look at all the people saying they wouldn't vote for female politicians because ""women are emotional."" It's not ""okay"" for women to show emotion, it's just expected because we're ""inferior."""
"Bro mode. I feel this to my core, that’s my default with everyone so I think that’s why I haven’t had many boyfriends haha"
There are tons of dating subreddits out there and most of these questions have already been asked (so they can use the search function). Or they can ask the other 6 days of the week. I’m sure they’ll live.
All of y'all are so brave. Thanks for sharing your stories.
A guy I know ripped the sleeves of his dress shirt just so his muscles and tattoos would show.
Everybody I match with on tinder
"Truth be told, when I'm around a guy I don't know, I operate under the idea of Schrodinger's Rapist: I don't know if you're a rapist or not until you do or don't rape me, but the possibility exists for both.

What I would PREFER men do is:

- Don't rape, assault or harass anyone.
- Call other men out when they are raping, assaulting or harassing anyone.
- Believe people who tell you they've been raped, assaulted or harassed.
- Offer victims support and do not, under any circumstances, attempt to take advantage of them.

Because as-is, I'm tired of having to be cautious all the time, I am tired of having to leave a sheet of paper with the name &amp; everything else I know about a guy I'm going out with in case I go missing so the cops have a good place to start. I am tired of sending text messages like, ""I'm in my car,"" ""I'm here,"" ""I'm inside,"" ""I'm back in my car,"" and ""I'm home,"" to friends, so the timeline of when something happened to me is as detailed as it can be.

But I don't feel safe enough to stop, because I see guys making rape jokes, or saying things like, ""I'd totally rape her,"" or defending men who've hurt people in the name of ~brotherhood at the expense of the bodies &amp; lives of victims.

Basically, you combat this image by being a decent human being, and by calling out people who aren't decent human beings, because you shaming them for being violent assholes holds more weight than a potential victim doing it."
"My teddy lost Most of his fur and I would argue He is a bit smelly but that's what happens with Most men in 35 years as well.

they're thinking of attractive women only
"The scene in Friends where Ross brings a fucking picnic to Rachel's office after she explicitly tells him that she's too busy to celebrate their anniversary. Instead of accepting that like an adult, he comes busting into her office, is loud and disrespectful, and *lights a fucking fire* while she's on the phone. Then, after she throws him out, he has the nerve to act like *he's* the wronged party. Ugh, I hate it so much. Everything about the ""Rachel's new job"" story arc is practically unwatchable."
Mental health and taking care of it is taboo.
An almost impressive array of things to be honest. From the petty to the violent that dude had done it. After I left the secretaries made a special rule just for him where they wouldn't let him in the office unless the lawyer was there. Not sure what he did to trigger that but I will say it takes a lot to scare one of those seasoned legal secretaries. Those people have seen a lot in their day
"Ah yes, the two shades of communist, democratic socialist and tankie."
"I work retail. A older man came to customer service asking if I could help him find someone to put an air conditioner we sell into his carriage and then in his car, as the units were pretty heavy. I said I would be happy to help. When I went to grab the AC for him and put it in his carriage to purchase it he goes “please tell me you aren’t going to help me, you’re making me look bad that a girl has to help me”. After I put it in his carriage and he checked out, he refused to let me or anyone else help him to his car with it even though he clearly was going to struggle. Oh well I guess!"
"I also was tricked into a date.  This guy I worked with said he would drive with me to see our friend sing and that other work people were all showing up as well.  It turned out no one else was there and he ""suggested"" we get dinner and seemed nervous and totally knew I was on to his little plan.  It honestly wasn't bad because I had good conversations with him and we were always comfortable around each other, but tricking someone into a date is lame and I would have been legitimately upset if I hadn't already established a friendship with him prior to that."
"There's two questions you're potentially asking here, and I'm going to answer each of them.  

First possible question:  **That is really messed up -- what can I do as a man to ensure that fewer men are predatory?**  Great question!  When you're in groups of guys, make it clear that anyone who makes rape jokes, who discusses women in general or someone they've dated as prey to be conquered, who discusses pick-up techniques or seduction techniques, who  acts as if dating is a ""hunt"" is a oddball throwback who's vastly out of touch with reality and reasonable behavior.  The culture isn't going to change unless men change it among themselves.

Second possible question:  **Assuming that that is the culture, what can I do as an individual to not seem like one of the predatory guys?**  Unfortunately, one of the most effective forms of being a predator is to not look like a predator, so ... you're kind of in a Catch-22.  This is the sort of question that a predator wanting to be more successful would reasonably ask.  And it IS really risky if a woman guesses wrong and gets into a compromising situation with the wrong guy, so many of us ARE going to be much more careful than any given situation may warrant.  

So understand why we do it.  Understand that we may not want to be alone with you until some trust has been built up.  Be friends with women, be part of the group that walks people to their cars at the end of the night.  Keep an eye on friends' drinks, so that nothing gets put into them.  Be a good guy, and be patient."
"I was 7 years old (Manila, Philippines) waiting for my dad to pick me up. An old man with a white cap, white cargo shorts, and white t shirt was carrying a liter of coke and kept asking me to come with him to have a drink. I was a very gullible kid (still kind of gullible even to this day) and hypnotically followed him across the busy street. Half way through the crosswalk I snapped back to reality and worried about my dad so I ran back."
"Yes. My crazydar is quite astute. I am the queen of the crazies. I have only met two or three people who I felt were truly crazy, though. One person I met I was pretty much sure he was a serial killer. He came up to my table and sat down by me and started asking me some very pointed questions. When we got to my age, I guess that was a turn off, because he excused himself and left. You see, I was 32 years old, but looked 18. I was pretty creeped out by the whole thing and thought I had dodged a serious crazy bullet.

&amp;#x200B;

The next night, I went to a strip club and guess who was there. He came up to me and started told me he would give me 500 to strip. It was almost tempting, but I declined. He asked me if he could by me a drink instead. I felt kind of trapped, but said yes. He bought me a drink and began to tell me stories of how he killed and raped young women in the Vietnam War. I was horrified. I excused myself and went and found my boyfriend. I kind of thought he was bullshitting, but kind of not.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to work the next day and everyone was talking about how a young girl age 18 had been killed. The girl I worked with's dad was the chief of police and had told her they suspected a serial killer was traveling I-40 killing young girls with long black hair. He would sneak up on them from behind, stab them in the neck, and watched as they bled out.  

&amp;#x200B;

I totally flipped out. In our conversations, the guy talked about how he was a traveling salesman who stopped in different towns on I-40. The way the girl was killed was the way he explained to me he killed those women in Vietnam. My saving grace was I was 32--too old for him to kill. 

&amp;#x200B;

I called the police and let them know what had happened, but couldn't even really remember his name. I never saw the car he drove. The info I gave them was pretty much useless."
"You have choices. You can leave. You can eat something, find someone to talk with, Or , a DIFFERENT person to talk with. Change the topic of discussion. Make an effort to change your mood. Be positive. You aren't stuck there forever, only an hour or 2."
"Oh sorry, the 2016 election!"
Plus guys felt so entitled to touch?? I can’t tell you how many times I would walk from the back to the front of the classroom and boys would put their hands out and grab my butt as I passed.
"The focus is not on penetration nor male pleasure as is normal in heterosexual relationships where PIV is the end all and the man cumming is the main event and usually marks the end of the sex.

Another (crude but direct)way of sayinf it is this: Women usually fuck you for your pleasure, men usually fuck you for theirs."
A great fucking idea. (No pun intended.) The only birth control that also protects against sexually transmitted diseases.
"Start of period: Constipation.
Middle of period: period shits."
"No, no, you see, it's a BIO-TROOF that women naturally scream and howl during sex but men are quiet. I know this because I watch porn and the women are screaming at the top of their lungs while the men barely even grunt."
"I love this! I recently realized I do lie after years of seeing myself as honest. I am moving toward telling the truth, which I didn’t always because of pride and shame. I realized by not telling the truth I am also in a sense pressuring others to not tell their truths—I don’t want to be a part of that. I may not be perfect but that’s okay and I want them to feel the same. (My little lies are aimed at bringing me a tad closer to the person I want to be than who I am...)"
"I'd ask him what the deal was. Maybe he'll pleasantly surprise me and reveal he's secretly Breadtuber who makes videos making fun of those dudes, like Shaun or Hbomberguy, and he was collecting material.

If it wasn't something like that though, and he actually agreed with any of that shit, I'd be gone."
"This reflects my experience as well. I’m with a man now, and we have great sex now, but it wasn’t necessarily great at first. In my experience men go straight to “wild sex”, which can be fun and pleasurable, but isn’t what everyone is into, and, in my experience, is more performative than anything. Lots of positions, jackhammering, fingers shoved in your mouth, porny stuff. Women are, in my experience just more sensual, in the moment, and I’m not sure if genuine is the right word, but I feel like it’s less of a performance with women."
"I married a European. We live in the US because it was 1000x easier to bring him here than to even try for me to move there and get permanent residence regardless of being married. 

Most people don’t realize how lax US immigration actually is compared to other countries.."
"Sadly, the British government isn't exactly the definition of sane lately, either."
"I secretly organized a couple of friends to go out on a date. 
I worked at a small private school for their summer camp. I was paired with a wonderful, but also extremely anxious/sensitive coworker. We got along well, but she was in late 30s, loved the drinking scene, Renaissance role play, and had never been married. She really needed to get laid.  Like, really really. 

One of the dads we worked with had a crush on her. He told me about it daily, as I also babysat his kiddo. So, he asks me to help ask her out. 

He arrives at work to pick up his kiddo. I magically pull all the children aside to get “snack”.  It’s those two left in the gym. He asks her out. She says yes. Happy happy joy joy. 

One year later, I’m the maid of honor in her wedding, all because I thought she needed laid."
2 of my cousins moved to the Caribbean in 2017 because of Trump. They had dual citizenship and decided to go.
Or just use the latex free
"I guess I have the opposite of that. I went out with one of my male coworkers who is my best friend. We went out all the time to bars, dinner, concerts, etc. and both knew it was never a date, mainly because he had a long distance girlfriend, and since we worked together. 

One night, after they broke up, we decided to get super dressed up to go out. We went to a murder mystery dinner party and a couple really fancy bars and were having a really great time as usual. We decided to stop in to the bar I worked at before heading back to his place to hang out, which we also normally did since he lived downtown and I did not. 
I guess I thought that night was different for some reason, I don’t know. One of my coworkers introduced us to some of her friends and I got incredibly jealous when he started making out with one of the girls about a half hour later. 

I went home alone that night and got mad at myself for crying over a guy I wasn’t even dating."
"Personally, I've never dated a friend. If I'm friends with someone, it's just impossible for me to be attracted to them and have romantic interest."
"I don't think ""hide"" is the right word, since it's pretty obvious. I just try to be sensitive to budgets and circumstances when we plan activities and don't suggest things like taking weekend trips or going to expensive restaurants. And, I don't complain about first world problems."
"This x100. IME women require so much more from you because you're already on the same level playing field of life and they are seeking a deeper connection (which is beautiful), men are satisfied with you being a woman and doing woman things anyway (truly they just are thrilled when you spot-clean a stain on their pants)."
"I do it out loud so hey, you're a bit ahead"
"In my experiences, most men tended to be far more focused on their own pleasure where women seemed far more focused on mine."
Well he didn't exactly end them either.
"It's so annoying whenever ""what things don't women understand?"" comes up and inevitably there's a lot of guys who don't seem to get that women are capable of imagining they have super powers etc. Some women even take it a step further and do stuff like write fanfiction!

Connected to this: I actually have to catch myself quite a lot because my knee-jerk reaction to my husband asking ""what are you thinking?"" is to say ""oh not much really"" because I've sort of internalised this message that women don't think empty/nonsense shit and I worry that if I admitted it, it makes me look stupid? He actually encourages me to share my silly thoughts though so I *am* getting better."
"He beat me up late at night, I went to work the next day and came home early.

I packed my essentials and started driving to the airport before he got home from work. By the time he realised what was happening I was 2 hours away, almost at the airport. I answered one call and told him I was about to board my flight and that our relationship was over (I hadn't actually booked the flight yet, I wanted to get my dog back first) 

I had a mutual friend help me convince my ex to give him my dog, I waited for my doggo for a day and got on that flight despite the constant txts and calls begging me to come home.

Best decision ever"
"I still had a horrible experience, just like everyone else. Ranged from petty fights with other girls, to sexual assault because high school guys assumed the pretty girls always wanted to have sex with everyone."
"Admitting fault. You're human, you're going to make mistakes. Just say ""yeah, I messed up and I'm really sorry"". I don't hold onto bad feelings, but I feel like I'm taking crazy pills when a guy refuses to admit he's wrong or he made a mistake."
"Yes, I ended up getting screamed at for “leading him on” and we are no longer “friends”. This has occurred several times and honestly I’m lucky I’ve never had violence come of it because some have."
"I sort of did? I had already applied for a job in Canada when 2016 happened, but the election was a big motivator to follow through on what had been essentially a joke. 

As for staying that's a bit complicated. My job while based in Toronto requires me to move around a lot. Currently I'm back in the US till the end of August. Knowing that I'm not stuck here permanently is a big relief though. I'm not sure I want to go back to living full time in the US anytime soon."
"&gt; Plus they tend to think of touching the clitoris as foreplay, and not, like, the primary source of sexual pleasure for most women. Some chicks can get off on the amount of penetration that most dudes are into. But for me, trying to get off from sex with most dudes is like if I were to try jacking them off by rubbing their balls.

That’s basically what mere penetrative sex is like for 70% of women. We can’t get off that way, the action is too far from any erogenous zones, it feels mildly pleasurable for a minute but then frustrating and boring."
"In high school I was not regarded as cute because I was slightly overweight and pale, and I grew up in the 00s when being tan was everything. 

Now I’m a very healthy athletic weight and still very pale- I’ve aged very well due to diligent sunscreen use and more importantly, I’m an interesting person with a real career. I never got to skate by on my looks as a teen, so I’m happy to have developed a personality and interests.

However I also can’t believe people when they say I’m cute or attractive now. It doesn’t compute. A lot of men from my high school class have attempted to reach out and talk to me in the  10 years since I graduated. None of them would have EVER given me the time of day back then. I don’t reply because it’s fucking weird and desperate"
Sounds like he didn't know how to deescalate his feelings and turned toxic as a result.
No kidding. I'd actually be scared.
"One of my brother's friends delivers for ubereats! 

She carries mace and has a body alarm (you press button, loudest fucking noise starts blaring) attached to a loop on her pants pretty much at all times and has her location shared with one of her friends whenever she's working.

After one unfavorable encounter she considered getting a little body cam. But a body cam can't protected you from being assaulted or snatched, so, she tossed the idea. I thought it wouldda been nice to have."
"I like traveling!  Stepping out of the normal round of my life to experience life in a different way.  At its best, it calls into question my assumptions about what ""normal is"" and how life can be.  And there are frequently treats like a pool or lake to sit in to enjoy."
"The scene in a recent episode of Brooklyn 99 where Jake 'comes around' to having kids after basically being given an ultimatum by Amy. Before that I felt like the show tackled all sorts of life challe ges in such a great way, but to have Jake just decide he was actually only unsure of having kids because he was 'scared in a good way' was so disappointing and made me so made. It felt so cheap and such a cop-out, and like it was validating every person who's ever told me 'oh you'll change your mind eventually'. I'm still mad about it."
"Blue balls. Not literally, of course, but if I get close to orgasm and then just stop completely, my clit literally HURTS."
"He's a guy that understands ""female pleasure."" A lot of guys don't have a clue as to what female pleasure is. They go off of what porn has ingrained in them, which is basically, pound her to oblivion until she moans and you finish. The female ""moaning"" during sex, in their minds, is the equivalent of a guy ""finishing"" - that she's been fully satisfied, when the stark reality is she's not even gotten started yet. I had a friend have a one night stand once and the guy refused to go down on her. I told her she deserves better. It's a damn shame really because women in general deserve so much better."
"My parents got me out of the state. I pretty always left after a fight but a few weeks/months would go back. Things would be good and then something would happen and things would get bad. This go round, it’s insane. My cousins got me out of the apartment, my parents got me out of the state. We changed my number. We’ve changed my emails. We’ve changed ALL of my passwords. 

If you’re just dating, you don’t have to stay in the relationship. You can leave. There are people who love you and will help you. 

If you’re married, do not feel like you have to stay, especially if you don’t feel safe, comfortable, respected, etc. You can leave. 

If you’re like me, we didn’t own property together, we didn’t have children together, we didn’t get credit cards together, we didn’t get loans together, heck, the apartment was just in his name. SO DO NOT FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO TALK TO THEM TO GET DIVORCED. File and have them served. 

If you are not comfortable in a situation, job, relationship, etc. you have EVERY RIGHT to walk out of that situation."
I’ve had a man body slam me out of the way before I could reach the door just so he could open it for me 🤦🏼‍♀️
"I’m an older bisexual (late 30’s) and I’ve dated more women than men but I’ll echo what another said about externalization vs. internalization. In the past, when I’d try and bring up an issue to my ex-boyfriends they’d get really upset and get angry at *me* for making them feel guilty, instead of feeling bad for their behavior. One example of this is that I had a male ex about 5 years ago who had a REALLY bad tendency to backseat drive. One day he lost his cool and yelled at me even though I was doing nothing wrong, and then condescendingly explained that he was “just trying to help since I’m a better driver.” I explained to him later that day that his freakout was scary and hurt my feelings, and that I wanted an apology. Instead what I got was him guilt-tripping me to apologize for *making him feel bad about his own actions* and we had a giant pity party for him and all about his guilt. I’ve had this exact scenario happen with nearly every man I’ve dated. It’s like when something goes wrong, they tend to externalize and find a way to make their partner feel bad for pointing out their bad behavior. Women on the other hand sometimes internalize things too much and have problems moving on once an argument has taken place."
My boyfriend used to look at those videos before we started dating.  Ive completely changed his perspective on feminism since then (3 years later). He genuinely thought all feminists were the types in those videos (usually TERFs) and that's why he wouldn't consider himself a feminist even though he agrees with the ideology that men and women are equal. After a few rational discussions over the past couple years he now will say that he is a feminist and understands that the cringey minority doesn't represent the majority of the movement at all.
"I met my ex-best friend in college and we were friends for eight years in total. Admittedly, there were a couple of rough patches and she has a history of cutting her friends out of her life for both minor and major infractions. Like seriously, she doesn’t have a single friend anymore that’s been around for more than a year—I was the last one to be cut!

We went through a lot together! A lot of ups and downs and personal growth. I was even in her wedding! 

Anyway, I moved across the country last fall. The summer before we spent so much time together and she was the last person before my family that I said goodbye to before I got on the plane. 

Initially, we stayed connected with a lot of video chats. But then she had a pretty serious family crisis and she didn’t tell me right away. I just stopped hearing from her and then eventually her husband filled me in. 

I tried reaching out to help support her and even offered to fly back home to be there for her. She was distant and wouldn’t really engage with me on the subject. That’s okay, I get it. When she did talk to me, it was about more superficial things like beauty trends/shopping, etc. I tried to share some things about my new city and life and she would just disregard them. I’d again offer more support to her and she would give me the highlights but mostly ignore me. 

I stopped trying as hard, and about a month later started planning a trip home to see my family for the holidays. I reached out to her to see if she wanted to meet up and expressed that I would really love to see her and connect in person because I know it’s hard long distance. She didn’t respond for a week before she finally said she was “too busy” and would have to “catch [me] next time.” It REALLY hurt my feelings. 

Then she stopped interacting with me on social media (which is silly, but she makes a HUGE deal about Instagram so it really is a signal for her). Meanwhile, in her stories she would constantly make comments about how her new grad school friends were SOOOO supportive and helpful during her family crisis. It felt passive aggressive and pointed at me. I finally stopped interacting with social media too because I can a hint. 

Then one day, I realized I hadn’t seen a post from her in a while. I searched her name and sure enough, she had blocked me. And not just from her regular account, from her pet account, and her husbands page. She also blocked me on Facebook, Twitter, and GOODREADS! And she didn’t just block me, she blocked my sisters and my dad. I don’t think she knows my mom has an Instagram, because my mom is not following her but can see her profile in the search. 

So, that’s how that friendship ended. I have no clue what I did that would justify ending an eight year friendship, but honestly, I don’t really miss her anymore. It hurt my feelings and I feel like it was really rude how she handled things after I moved, but she was a high maintenance and very judge mental/particular friend and it’s kind of a relief."
"YES! You can be the most gentlemanly person out there, OP, but some women will still be cautious. Just take it in stride and move on. The worst thing you can do is to #NotAllMen yourself because it makes you a creep by asserting your own nice guyness to people. 

The best men in my life have been respectful of my space and privacy, listened to me, and have treated me as just another person."
"This makes me laugh because I was just saying to a friend yesterday that it seems like every single woman on earth has one pesky hair on her face (usually on the chin).

Anyway mine is also on the chin, just hanging out right at the bottom. I can't remember when I got it, but I think I was around 20-21? That's when I *noticed* it anyway."
"I had girls every day call me a slut even tho I wasnt sexually active or flirty in highschool, they would always make their boyfriends block me/not talk to me because they didnt like me despite never meeting or talking to them. High school was rough but I got a great boyfriend out of it!!!"
"A fair few of my female friends, and sometimes my mum and sister assume that just because I don't wear makeup, care about fashion and beauty and the like, that I'm really insecure about by my appearance and I just need someone to teach me about makeup and fashion and they can ""fix"" me. 

It is really annoying. I'm not insecure about my looks or my body, and I don't need people telling me that I should wear this or that."
"I was similar when I went off to college, just one close girl friend and a bunch of dudes that suddenly weren't interested in being my friend now that I wasn't close enough to maybe one day hook up with. I graduated 8 years ago though and now I have several close girl friends and I feel so supported by them. I hope you find the same for yourself, I met most of mine through work."
"Every woman I’ve been with has at least tried to get me off or ask me what they should do. Doesn’t mean they were good at it, but shit at least the tried.  I’ve slept with three men now  and not one of them even bothered to try except my current boyfriend. It took him about 2.5 years to finally get me off after me repeatedly telling him that penetration ain’t gonna cut it for me. Now the sex is the best I’ve ever had because he cares about if I orgasm and I actually do now. 

I’m not sure how anyone can have sex with another person....and then just straight up ignore their sexual needs. If I had just masturbated on my partners and then left when I finished they’d be pissed."
"If it stinks everywhere you go, check your shoe.


There was a time where I was the cause of almost all my problems."
"Less selfish, not obsessed with penetration, less likely to have a gross/creepy/disturbing fetish, less interested in power play, more caring, more willing to put in effort to get you off, less likely to be interested in porn-y sex etc"
The world needs more people like your mom. Thank you for sharing this.
"This is just an anecdote, but I've noticed that people my age (26) tend to forgo condoms due to birth control implants, which strikes me as pretty irresponsible. I get that sex without it feels better, but I can't really enjoy myself if babies and diseases are potentially on the menu. And condoms help me last longer."
Women have a higher interest in slowly warming up and making sure the other party is also satisfied. Men seem to be more self focused. However some men have the oral portion down pat!
"I was out at a bar dancing when I felt like I was being watched. Whenever I would look over, it was the same dude who would divert his eyes. This guy looked like a stereotype of a good looking guy - he was tall, built, well-dressed, handsome, chiseled, blond hair, blue eyed - I don't know, he was ruggedly handsome and notably so.  

Anyway, at the end of the night, he comes up to me, introduces himself, and asks for a dance. I declined. Then he asked if he could take me out to dinner sometime. He made it clear that he wanted to take me out to dinner at a time and place that was convenient for me and that he wasn't pushing for anything later that evening as it was already late. 

It was such a proper date proposal that I was surprised to hear myself say no. 

I don't know how to explain it. He was too poised and everything he said and did was too perfect, his affect and mannerisms too rehearsed, and his eyes too determined... it sounds crazy as I write it, but something within me was just telling me that if I ever went on a date with him, that our meeting in that bar was going to be the start of a Dateline miniseries of things that would soon go horribly wrong. 

After I declined, he thanked me for my time, wished me a wonderful night, and bowed out of my space. 

It's strange because everything he did and said was more proper than my typical encounters, but there was something about him made me feel uneasy. It reminded me of a predator catching his prey. I can't pinpoint what gave me such strong instincts to not be alone with him. To this day, I still find it so perplexing because he was the first, and only, person I have ever felt that unsafe around and I can't even identify what it was that told me to run."
Woohoo! Thanks
"Hate having sex WITHOUT them. 

Married for 12 years, together for 18.  Use them every single time we are not actively trying to conceive, even though we are both disease free and monogamous. Easier clean up."
"I think the most important thing to bettering yourself is self love. Accept that you have value and worth, and deserve to be here. Self love is ultimately #1, and once you’ve put forth that energy into the universe, things start to make so much more sense!

Learn to say “no” without feeling bad, or feeling like you need an excuse. 

Learn to speak up not just when you think you should, but also when it’s the right thing to do. 

Try to do something alone, or something with lots of people. Get out of your comfort zone! 

Volunteer, even if it’s just helping a neighbor carry their groceries.

Do things because you want to do them and because they make you happy. 

Clean your bedroom or house. Take a shower. Set a list of goals that are easy and check an item off and watch the list disappear, then start a new one. 

Find the good in people even when they annoy the ever loving shit about you - *that ones from my great grandma who died at 99, lived on her own, and read a book every day. She was a bad ass*

Take a walk, go for a hike, have a healthy smoothie, and thank your body for how far it’s gotten you!"
"&gt; **What can a guy do to combat this image?** 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't be shitty and predatory. What you consider ""an image"" is something that a lot of us consider ""the reality we live with every day."""
Yes. Yes it is. I was in high school.
"My sister was just about to get on the train to move to another city and I was in bits (about 11 at the time). 
I saw this man who looked really shifty on the platform and I told them both how odd he looked and that I was worried. 
They both said it was fine, he got on the train and then my sister did not long after that. Train started to move, we waved goodbye, and I noticed the guy was sitting behind my sister and it freaked me out but I couldn’t do anything at that point. We went home.

About an hour later, my mum got a call from my sister saying that two stops into the journey, armed police had gotten onto the train (now I’m not too sure of the exact details here), they either checked his bag in front of other passengers or took him to the police station. 
Either way, the guy had components to make a bomb and he was planning on blowing up the same train my sister was on.
I don’t even know how the police knew this, or why I felt uncomfortable about him. But I’m glad he couldn’t go through with his plan in the end."
"&gt;the man had cheated on his wife with a teenage girl who was about 14

I think you meant to say he raped a 14 year-old. Children cannot consent to sex. That's why age of consent laws exist."
"Hahaha this reminds me of my friend at her 21st birthday party.

She had a house party (as was the norm for her family, who are all mental in the best way), I went with my BF at the time and a mutual friend of ours (Mark) who had met some of my friends a few times, as BF didn't know my friends and I didn't want him to be isolated while I was hanging out with my friends.

I think Mark must have either grown out or cut his hair or something, because it got to the end of the night and we were heading home and saying goodbye to the birthday girl, who was super drunk at this point. She suddenly clocked who Mark was and that she knew him it went like this:

**Friend:** Oh my gosh!! MARK!!!! MARK!!! I didn't even recognize you. I'm so sorry, I didn't even speak to you, thank you so much for coming, I'm so sorry!  
**Mark:** Don't worry about it! You're grand  
**Friend:** No, it's so rude of me. MARK!! You're great. I'm so sorry. *\*grabs the nearest item to her\** have a plant!  
**Mark:** No, no I'm grand, you're grand.  
**Friend:** No, you're the nicest person, and I didn't know it was you, take the plant!

So Mark went home with my one of friend's houseplants."
"We have unfair expectations too.

With men, they're expected to go out there, have sex a lot, and to be overly masculine to be called a man. And when you don't live up to those expectations, you're frowned upon.

Women have that as well. We're expected to be nurturing, overly emotional, sweet, quiet, passive, submissive. And when we aren't that way, we have both men &amp; females frowning upon us. These things start from young. Girls are punished for the same things a guy does, but because we're females, it's wrong.

So, if we want to play in the dirt &amp; get dirty we're punished for it.

It's a lot of pressure.



We also get rejected as well. That's why this whole ""plastic surgery"" thing is extremely bad for people's mental health because they see those girls with those bodies being put on a pedestal while we don't have a body close to that.

There are more body types than just an hour glass figure, and we won't ever get that shape because that's not our natural body's shape. It doesn't matter if we go to the gym. To compare a fake body to a real one, won't work. And not everyone wants an hour glass figure. Not everyone wants a big ass &amp; big tits. Some of us are content with how our body is &amp; we don't want the newest trendy body type. And I'm sure some skinny guys/overweight guys are content with their body as well &amp; they don't want to be a muscular guy. 

You have baggage, we have baggage. However, that doesn't excuse toxic behavior. So don't feel like just because a girl broke your heart makes it okay for you to break mine. Just like I won't let my trust issues get in the way of our relationship just because some guy betrayed me in the past. 

We all deal with similar issues. COMMUNICATE. We cannot read your mind just like you can't read ours. Sometimes, we can't understand where you're coming from so you have to explain in multiple ways for us to understand. And don't get frustrated with us because we're trying to understand."
"This.

I am a US citizen who worked in the EU for a few years.  It was luck/good timing, and I just happened to work in a field that was considered 'high demand', so they had an easier standard for me to meet.  I don't know if I would be able to do it again.  And most people I know, even smart people with above median incomes, wouldn't be able to do so.  

At least not in this particular country.  

Like many American's my options were limited heavily by my inability to understand any language other than English.

Each country is different and some places have special shorter term programs.  In my case, it took three months *after* accepting the job to get my work permit approved, and the application was crazy expensive, I want to say 1000 EUR but I might be wrong.  

People also underestimate the cost.  I had a house, 1600 sq ft, and all the junk that goes with it.  Furniture, electronics, houseware crap, boxes of old crap from college.... A truck and a car.

My wife and I each took two suitcases.

Everything we had, we needed to either sell or put in storage.  Selling things, especially in a hurry, means you don't get much for it.  And then you fly over and need to purchase all that crap you just sold again.

Now I'm in a new country.  No credit history, no work history, no bank account, no utility bill to prove my address so I can open a bank account.  Couldn't legally drive either.  It was a real mess.  

Certainly all of these are trivial problems if you are loaded.  But I very strongly suspect that most Americans just haven't thought about the actual logistics of it."
"I had an emergency hysterectomy to keep me from bleeding to death in childbirth, and lost one ovary in the process, 

I wanted to keep both ovaries, but I know my doctor couldn’t see everything clearly because of the bleeding. 

The one ovary that remained isn’t functioning well, since I was already dealing with premature ovarian failure. So I take estrogen (birth control pills) to help manage the hot flashes that I’ve experienced since then.

I’m hoping the estrogen I’m taking will also help delay the premature aging that comes from surgical menopause. I can expect my bones to become brittle, and heart disease to be a challenge, earlier in my life because my menopause has hit earlier.

I can’t remember shit. My brain is super cloudy all the time. The pills help some.

My sex life has suffered, but that’s probably because I have babies (twins) now and no sleep, no free time.

I can still orgasm, though. Something like 30% of women who have hysterectomies lose that ability.

Honestly, try to find a doctor who will put you on birth control pills, and let you skip the placebos, so you just don’t have a period. They aren’t medically necessary."
"Maybe it’s just me, but I don’t really feel much of a difference whether he’s using them or not so I’m not bothered by them"
"I didn't have my first kiss until university. Didn't lose my virginity until I was 24. I didn't mind those things inherently, like I know there's nothing wrong with being a late bloomer, but it still sucks to be thought of as unattractive and unwanted. And there has been no glow-up. I am still ugly (look almost the exact same, but with different hair). Still never had a boyfriend."
"Not sure if the fact that this man is gay is relevant, but he confided in me that he had a “man “problem, he has a hemorrhoid.  I told him women get them as well, to which he replies, “oh yeah, I guess they can get them during childbirth”. He was actually a bit dumbfounded when I told him that I currently had one myself, I’ve never had a child. He then implied it was more of a problem for him because of sex."
"Dude I used to think the expression ""go steady"" was ""go study"" because anytime I saw it used was in movies from the 50's and I figured ohh they say ""go steady"" since things were conservative back then."
"Ime, when arguing, women are more convincing and men are more dismissive. For example, if I complain about them not washing the dishes, and both argue that they shouldn't have to, the man will take the tine that I'm unreasonable/nagging/crazy and wasting his time, and the woman will take the tone that what she did was justified and perhaps suggest a diffetent division of labor"
"&gt;didn’t respond to limits about not letting the dog lick his face, no matter what I said about the dog being young and needing to learn manners.

Not sure if you've ever read it but in The Gift of Fear, Gavin de Becker lists discounting a ""no"" as a pre-incident indicator. Ignoring somebody's boundaries and not caring that they said to stop is a bad sign. Awesome job picking up on that."
Which election
"That's so creepy.  Something very similar happened to me. He was a co-worker (I was his supervisor) and he said he was having a party and invited everyone from the department. I figured I'll make an appearance and show up at his house. I was the first there so he offered to give me a tour of his house. We get to his room and it is covered in posters of naked women and shelves of porn. I was extremely uncomfortable and made an excuse to leave. Later I find out there was no party, just a trick to get me alone in his house, shudder. People were even asking how our date went."
"Yeah find a comfortable routine that you can practice in, for example, I passed my test a few months ago and I started off by driving to my local super market that I am very familiar with and only has a few junctions and 1 round about and then I built up to further distances. I also think a sat nav is great help with getting directions in advance"
"Refuse my help lifting someone and throwing out their back


My poor dainty lady arms probably would have just snapped right off if he didn't do it all by himself"
It’s worth a bad recommendation to able to wake up the next day. I did something similar and also left my job with no forewarning because I worked with my SO at the time. Couldn’t let on that anything was amiss or he’d shoot me as I slept.
"Black woman born and raised in Germany here🙋🏾‍♀️
Although I consider Germany my home - people often make you feel as if you don't belong. The struggles I faced and vividly remember began in elementary school. Other students or my teacher would say derogatory things and I often had to work twice or three times as hard as the other students to get good grades. The worst incident I faced as a child was being chased by neo nazis..it literally gives me chills to this day. I grew up in a smaller german city/town though so it depends on where you live how bad it is with Nazis. For example East Germany is a no go zone and you will rarely find People of Color/Black people. Although I've lived here my entire life I would never go to east germany.. way too dangerous. Growing up people made fun of my hair and German people WILL touch your it without asking. And they STARE. I'm now 23 and live in a big city so life has been better although I still experience racism (for example: when I was looking for apartment people would usually be nice on the phone but when I went to see the apartment or say my name it was a instant no/the apartment is taken). When it comes to dating I've experienced different things: its either fetish of some sort or people will tell me ""Oh, you're so pretty for a black girl""🙄 and once in while you will find a normal guy lol. Honestly I could go on and on, but it would be way too much. If you ever plan on visiting - go to a big city :) And sorry for my english - its not my native language (Duh) but  I love speaking it either way :)"
Your story is incredible and I applaud you for having the strength to do that. Congratulations.
DOZENS!
When your nose has been clogged for godknows how long and it finally clears again.
I wholeheartedly agree. I find it incredibly insulting when a man thinks he can solve my problem within 2 minutes of hearing it when I've been dealing with it all day/week/year.
"Nah, she met a Nigerian Prince."
"""i don't know"" shouldn't be used as a excuse to not dig deep into my issues. I am very okay with telling people that i don't know something to the point where i use it as a crutch when i want to not think about something uncomfortable."
"Whenever people that do heinous stuff like that wind up dead of an apparent suicide somewhere I always imagine vigilantes taking them out there and making it *look* like a suicide and the police don’t look too hard into it.

Good riddance either way."
"Yep.
It was was in my old job, I worked in a factory my father used to work in for 3 decades; so I knew pretty much everyone in there.

So, when a new worker came to an interview and our department's boss showed him the storage room (the position he was interviewed for was storage manager) and he wouldnt stop staring at me, I had a bad feeling.
Dude got hired, and every here and then, if he didnt stare at me like I was naked all the time,  he would make a suggestive comments on my work (mind you, the dude was in his 30's, married with 3 kids and I was 22).. but I didnt give it too much thought.. But my bad gut feeling was still there.

Then things got a little worse. I had a project to do in the storage room, and when me and him were alone he started making sexual comments about my relationship (I talked to a woman who worked in the storage room and told her about my LDR, and he heared us). He asked what was my boyfriend's name, wanted to see what he looks like etc.. to all I told him its none of his buisness. Then he crossed the line and said ""you know you can sleep with others and he will never know right?""
Thats when I reported him to my boss (who told me to wait until he leaves the job by the end of the week &amp; that they wont let me stay alone with him.. but I was) and realized that I should've trusted my gut better. 
This was 2 years ago, and I still remember his pretadory eyes whenever I told him ""no""."
I told him that I didn't want to talk politics. He kept bringing it up. I ended up angry-crying while driving home from watching Avengers Civil War with him. I think he stopped after that. It's funny how men are always so whiny about women being emotional all the time but they don't listen when I ask/say something calmly.
"The global political swing to the far right, and how much of that is being controlled by the rich and powerful who care little for minorities."

Most incel probably don't know a woman actually invented the term incel because she was one and created the group as a means of positive support. She's super disappointed in what it transformed into.
Peace and quiet.  Not cleaning up after anyone but yourself. Home decorated how you want. No explaining or excusing yourself. Want something? Get it.
"Wow! He blew it and didn't know. Also, the friend he brought is a terrible wingman."
