"When I meet a mature, confident lady who is, to the best of her ability, juggling her responsibilities successfully.

One of my colleagues is diligent and always dresses beautifully, and somehow manages to find time to work out, make sure her dog gets two good walks, keeps an eye on her teenagers, cooks mostly from scratch and helps her husband run his dentistry. She takes everything in her stride and rarely complains. I’m in awe of her, and I hope I can be like her one day. She still meets her friends for coffee or wine on the weekends, and attends as many concerts as she can for fun. She absolutely has her act together, and I think she’s bloody brilliant. A real champ!"
"Best date I ever had was also my first Tinder date. We went to a baseball game, the aquarium, out for burgers, then back to his place to watch 'House'. It was a 12 hour date...we just had so much fun with everything, it was so easy to be together. 

Married him."

"i'm pretty short, and i've asked a number of people to help me reach things in stores without issue. i asked one guy, and he went *off* on me yelling ""does it look like i work at this fucking store? am i walking around in a fucking uniform? what the fuck makes you think i have to do anything for you? why the fuck don't you just go find yourself a fucking ladder and go reach your stupid fucking box of (whatever it was, idk) yourself, you lazy (slur)?""

some other tall guy was right there and grabbed it for me. i thanked him and left the angery dude scowling in the aisle."
" If someone brings you food in a food container, that you know you have to give back to them, never give it back empty. Maybe it's a rural thing, my mom tought it to me and from that point everytime I get something from someone when I return it, I bake some pie, or muffins and stuff that container."

"Was looking at an apartment with my sister and my mom came with us. The landlords were two men, a super old guy and his son. The son was super polite but the dad kept asking us how we were expecting to pay for an apartment and utilities. He at one point asked us if we knew that things cost money and then asked my mom, the main breadwinner in our family, what my dad did for work. 

Safe to say we didn’t rent that place."
"During my senior year of high school my group of girl friends often hung out with a group of guys. For prom, several of the my friends were either 1) dating a guy from the group and going to prom with them or 2) going with someone as friends. I had a crush on one of the guys for a long time and we’d talk on Facebook occasionally.  I was talking to him about prom and asking if knew who he was going with or if he knew anyone who was looking for a date. He sent me a message saying, “Yo guys. [my name] is begging someone from the group to take her to prom. Who is gonna do it? [laughing emoji].” He hadn’t realized he sent it to me instead of the group chat with his friends. I felt so awful about myself and it was not fun when we had to go do prom pictures together and what not. I did my beat to enjoy my time with my girl friends though."
"""But you were at Disneyland! You could have cheated on me there! ""

I went with my mom and aunt. To Disneyland."
That sensation is called the “Hemsworth Response” and there is no known cure.
"""We were planning a threesome as a surprise for you and decided to test it first"" He knew I wasn't into other girls... But boy, he was."
"MOTHER FUCKING DOLLY PARTON.  I don't even like/listen to country really but she's a real working class hero.

Yes, Jolene, 9-5,  I Will Always Love You are chart certified 100% bangers, but also

https://imaginationlibrary.com/ - she has created an international charity that supplies children from birth to the age of 5 with a book a month.

I will literally fight you if you talk shit about Dolly."
"Years ago, but still makes me furious.
I bought a new computer with no operating system installed and when I got it, there was only the computer in the box without anything else (documentation about parts, drivers, anything). I called their hotline to find out what exactly was in that new computer and said I was happy to download my own sound and graphics drivers but didn't feel much like disassembling the thing to find out which ones I needed. So could they just tell me on the phone?

They kept saying a) that I needed to find the ""silver disc with a hole in the center"" in the box and it would have my drivers (nope, if there was a CD, I wouldn't be calling and I was pretty sure most women understand what a CD-ROM is)
b) that I probably wouldn't be savvy to change directories under MS-DOS to locate the one called ""drivers"" (I actually am and had already found out that there was absolutely nothing to be found)
and then just kept repeating this:
""The computer. I'm sure it's for a man. Get me the man who will use the computer on the phone and we can get this sorted in no time.""

20 years later, I'm still fuming.
I later took the computer to one of their shops and they confirmed not only that it was exactly as I said and they hadn't sent me some basic info, but also that their hotline was staffed with a bunch of complete jerks."

"Being an introvert means that other people wear me out. But the closer I became to my husband the less he was “other people” and the more he felt like an extension of myself. By the time we were living together, spending time with him around became a perfectly acceptable form of “alone time.” There’s time we spend together, and there’s time we spend in the same house."
"This is somewhat related. I was 23 when I bought my first house. One of my coworkers asked me on three separate occasions when my wedding was. She said she just assumed I was getting married since I was buying a house. Which may have been understandable the first time as we are in the southern US. The third time, I looked at her and said women were allowed to own property."
“I didn’t tell you about this because I was worried you would get upset”
Jane Goodall!
"My wife is older than me (she's 34 while I am 32) and not only wanted to carry but is absolutely built to carry a baby - perfect no issues pregnancy so far *knocks on wood* 

Our due date is August 10th and we found out today that baby boy is head down. Hope he stays that way!"
"Asked my boss to use my vacation days starting after the christmas break, and also some other off days that I hadn’t used. That was apparently selfish of me, made me not a team player, and got me fired."
"Don’t over pluck your eyebrows- sometimes they don’t grow back!! And how to properly shape them!

Thanks Mom for not letting me pluck the 90s pencil thin eyebrows when I was 15!"
"I just had this the other day! It was NOT because I was turned on (yes vaginas pulse after you orgasm but I don’t get the feeling that was OP’s question). It happened out of nowhere and lasted the entire day. 

It was very similar to when you smash a finger and it swells up and you can feel your heartbeat in it. I attributed my pulsating pussy to the fact that I wore my tightest pair of jeans for 12 hours and it caused some uncomfortable pressure and rubbing lol!"
"""It's not cheating because I was already planning to break up with you.""

Okay, but you didn't so it was..."
If you're profiting off of idiots dumb enough to buy it she should have charged more than 30 bucks.
"When I was in middle school, the 6th grade put on a Halloween show every year. There was one student who got to play a part and everyone else was chorus. It was a boy’s part, but the teacher who chose it (Mrs. B) said she’d consider girls too. I wanted that part so badly, but I was shy and didn’t get great grades, so I knew Mrs. B wouldn’t think about giving it to me unless I said something.

One day, I gathered my courage while everyone was working quietly at their desks. To give you an idea how hard this was for me, I used to have to gather my nerve just to ask to go to the bathroom. I walked up to Mrs. B and asked if she’d consider me for the part in the performance. She repeated my question loudly so everyone in the class heard. Then she said, “No, you can’t have the part because I don’t want people coming up to bother me. Class, anyone who asks me about the part will automatically not be considered.” I was humiliated. I sat down at my desk crying quietly (I cry easily). Mrs. B said, “Now she’s crying. I’m not going to feel sorry for you just because you’re crying.” If she said anything else I can’t remember it."
"""her shower wasn't working"" so he proceeded to invite her over to shower together, they also fucked out of the shower and hooked up a number of times but that was just his excuse"
I think it's the ability to calmly produce whatever you are asking for. Need a report in the office? Give it a minute. She has it. Have a question about something? She knows it. Need something she doesn't truly have an answer for? She asks around and figures it out with you. All while being calm collected and positive. That kind of grace under pressure makes a woman have it all together. That is the kind of woman I aspire to be.
"One manager (retail side manager not the grower) who is a woman herself is constantly telling to ""get a guy to do that"".  I work in horticulture.  I am working as a grower helper at a green house and also my own landscaping business on the side.  Sometimes I have to lift big pots, fountains, benches, blocks of peat, big hanging baskets.  I've installed ponds.  I shovel mulch.  I'm not a professional athlete, but I'm mo push over.

  EVERY TIME this woman sees me lifting anything that looks like it could be over 25lbs she is on my ass.  One day I just looked at her and said, ""It must be a miracle you raised kids."" She looked at me funny and asked what I just said.  I restarted that ""it must have been hard to find a man to help her pick up her children every time they were over a year old because I had never seen anyone ask a women if a child was too much to carry."""
"I've rarely heard anyone say anything bad about Michelle Obama, and nobody better even try."
"Twice in a row, I've asked my boss for a raise. She says yes, of course, I will make it work. Then she ignores me for a few weeks until I corner her and she says it isn't in the budget, or it's not fair, or whatever. I was crushed the first time because I was so proud of myself for asking.

Now I know not to get excited until I have something in writing."
"The ones with lots of fresh, healthy groceries in their shopping baskets AND remembered to bring reusable bags to the store. When I stand next to women like this in line all I can do is try to make my pile of junk food look as tidy as possible."
I need you to know my dumb ass googled this thinking it was an actual medical condition lol.
"My first boss was really upset that I didn't know how to make coffee (because I don't drink it). He asked me to make him one, and I said ""sure, but it might be crap, I've never made one before"" and he goes ""what? How do you not know how to make coffee? But you're a woman!"" 


Yes, and I'm a woman who doesnt drink coffee, usually surrounded by men who are capable of making their own."
"1. They're afraid to come off as gay, or even bi-curious. Huge stigma there. 
2. Many men won't see something as hot, if they're not personally attracted to it. So they're less likely to give a compliment like ""Your hair looks super nice"" if it's not their thing. I'm not into blondes, but I'll still compliment my blonde friend's hair when she's obviously done something to it. 
3. Many (not all) men are uncomfortable with compliments generally. Giving or receiving them. They likely don't get compliments (well meaning or creepy) across their lifetimes, so they're less familiar with them and socialized to them. 
4. Many (not all) men, because of #3 and a gendered empathy gap, have little confidence when it comes to giving compliments because they either don't know what to say without sounding creepy, or give compliments and sound creepy and have been chastised for creepiness in the past. This hesitation holds for male and female-directed compliments.
   1.  It's usually the same guys who can't really put their feelings into words, like.... they know they're ""sad"" but don't know how to introspect and see the difference between the sads associated with disappointment, loneliness, boredom, frustration, sleep deprivation.... 
5. Many (not all) men, despite being visually-oriented, don't notice a lot of the details, or even major aesthetic changes in others, surprisingly. If I think about what elicits a ""ohh damn you look great!"" comment from me, it's usually a friend getting a new haircut/outfit/makeup look... which many men just 100% don't notice, or only notice like a little bit subconsciously and can't put their finger on it. So, they're not as likely to notice, understand, care, and then put in effort to vocalize a compliment to a same-sex friend..."
“I wanted to see what our future was like. She was an older less attractive version of you”
"The only good thing she actually taught me was: If you can't afford it, don't buy it."
First date after a couple weeks of texting. She was a dogsitter so we spent the day picking up dogs and walking them togheter around town. I met so many puppies! It was adorable and I still cherish the memories
My mom taugh me how to cook things from scratch &amp; I've passed that down to my sons (no girls).
“I wasn’t naked. I had my earrings in.”
"Girl I just got my ass out of bed to dig it out of my drawer to tell you. Lilyette and it’s by Maidenform. I came across it at a thrift store(new with tags) and for some miracle it actually works! I won’t say perfectly, I only wear it for nights out, I couldn’t like wear it with a tank top and clean my house or do anything chest active haha but it totally holds up to a night of light dancing. If I had like a desk job I would trust it too, as long as I don’t need to bend over too much."
"Normally I get home from work first and do some light weight lifting. Then I get comfy and anxiously await my husband. I’ll usually just mess around on my phone with the Tv on. He texts me when he’s on his way home and I get excited. He gets home and we cuddle and hug. Depending on the night we might be super lazy and cuddle/watch a show. Other nights we have more energy and might be more active/talk during a show and goof around. That’s the usual. If Big Brother is on, we geek out and watch that. There are some days where we just need to do our own thing. He’ll play video games. I’ll write or read or find something to do. Then at night we eat a treat together before going to bed. We’re lucky that we seem to have the same energy/needs levels because we’ve never really had a problem with one wanting attention but the other being zonked out. I don’t know how but we always seem to be on the same wave length..."
Dildo blowjobs.
"I think they assume it would come from women they find attractive and that it's all a fucking big joke.

And they've never experienced fear, had their boundaries violated, or had their personal autonomy taken away from them.

Just the worst kind of people for trivializing other's lives like that."
"I never had much advice from my mother, but essentially my stand-in mom told me:

“Never stay with a guy who thinks he’s doing you a favour.”

Nothing has ever stuck with me more."
"Come home, talk about our day(s), prepare dinner together, watch TV while chatting and eating. Then some cuddling and relaxing on the couch, then we go our separate ways (respecting each others' space and ongoing projects/games/work) until bedtime. Works for us. Gotta find what works."
"I’m a pretty tall girl (5’10”, or 177.8cm) and I LOVE when short girls ask me to grab things for them off the tall shelves at the grocery store. It’s so cute and it makes me feel like a helpful friendly giant."
"Found a stack of Polaroid photos of him fucking other people in his sock drawer while putting away his laundry, all of them dated since we started dating.

""It wasn't me!""

Featured in them was the tattoo he got on our second date."
"Am that woman, by the time I’m done grocery shopping for all the healthy foods I know I should eat, i get lazy and go straight to the drive thru for dinner. Then half the produce sits wilted and sad in the fridge for a week before I make a dump everything in chicken broth and call it soup meal. 

Also, at 11pm is when I make my second trip to the market in a baggy hoodie so I don’t have to put my bra on for all the junk food that I wanted to get earlier. But I’ll have my reusable bags with me so that’s redeeming right? 

It’s all a lie 😉"
"When I was a child, mum said ""if you get lost, find a woman with children and ask her for help"". I think it's good advice."
"Boyfriend wanted me to cook for him. I said, great, no problem, I'll cook and you clean up. Boyfriend was offended ""No, the rule is whoever cooks also washes the dishes"" 

So I never cooked for him. And he complained I wasn't ""feminine"" enough.

Note, however, that he had no complaints about me being ""not feminine enough"" when I paid for dinner, or when I drove to see him instead of him picking me up. 

It was funny, see, he was all about equality when it benefitted him and he was all about gender roles when they benefitted him! 

We didn't last long."
"Not the worst, but funny. Years ago I used to work in a garden shop, I was 17 and petite but strong. I walked past a guy struggling to pick up a large bag of concrete and he asked me if I could “go find a man to help”. I told him I could help him. He looked me up and down (I was in my uniform mind you), chuckled, and said “no thanks love, if there’s nobody else around I think I’ve got it” then dropped it straight on his foot hahaha"
Look at the fingernails.
"I asked my energy supplier to talk me through their tariffs as I was having trouble deciding which would be best and their website really wasn’t clear.

The (female) advisor said: “Have you asked your husband?”

I basically took her head off. I understand energy tariffs - my husband doesn’t - their website was just really unclear. Was not impressed!"
"Protect yourself from pregnancy AND use condoms unless you know they don’t have STIs and are in a committed relationship. 

Don’t be afraid to say “no.” 

She also most importantly taught me how important being independent is and to not rely on a man for anything."
"His drunk ass fell asleep so I went through his phone because I'd suspected he was cheating for a couple months..this chick claimed she had a yeast infection and he *still* wanted to bang her..""you should get some condoms because if she gets a yeast infection, she'll know what's up"". 
Then when I confronted him with his phone in my hand, he said they had set up that conversation on purpose to prove I was looking through his phone 🤦‍♀️"
"She should have charged more. If guys are going to be that gullible, might as well profit off them."
"Deciding it was time to euthanize my cat. When she reached the point where I could see the pain, fatigue, and sadness in her eyes I knew it was time, there was no denying it.

I made sure the whole week before the appointment though was one of the best of her life. Playing outside, catnip, lots of cuddles, all the human food her little heart desired, etc."
"My favorite first date was to a used bookstore. We both browsed up and down the aisles and look for interesting things and talked about some of the things we saw. Afterwards we went and got coffee and continued our discussion of books and the led to movies and music. At one point we decided to go for a walk by a pond.

The bookstore was good because it allowed us to talk about our interests and differences in a very natural,  non forced way, and that just conti ied throughout the rest of the date. Of course, that doesnt work if one or the other has no interest in books..."
"I imagine a woman who is 6’11”, has a small recliner, fridge, and tv in her uterus, 3’ wide hips, and can shoot watermelons from her vagina 200 yards rapid-fire, and the ability to dilate her cervix at will, all while maintaining perfect hormonal health."
"I'm 5'3"" and I had one 4'8"" old lady ask me to reach something for her and I too felt like a helpful friendly giant for that special 15 seconds."
"She responded vaguely what he does and then said “well don’t you want to know what I do for work?” And then she went into a long detailed explanation on what she does. 

She also was very good at correcting them on the money issues, I’ve lived alone for the past year and paid all of my bills myself, she would bring this up anytime a money question came up, which was frequently."
"lol yeah

it means whatever i'm looking at is turning me on"
She's quenching a thirst.
Only one of us wanted to.
"My sister is 15 years younger than me, and when she was born, the (older) female relatives went on and on about how they were so excited to see me performing child-rearing duties, no more being a spoiled teenager with no children of my own. The most pointless aspect of their ramblings was that my sister and I didn't even live in the same city, as she was a child of remarriage. When did they expect me to parent her, during the once a year that we saw each other? (Yes, in case you're wondering - that's exactly what they thought would make sense.)

In a separate incident, as a kid I was at some gathering at a family friend's house. There were quite a lot of people there, and there was a lot of eating going on. All of us kids, girls and boys, were playing in the back yard. Suddenly one of the older ladies appeared in the kitchen doorway and barked, ""All you girls! Get in here and wash the dishes!""    
I was flabbergasted, since my mother had completely forgotten to teach me about gender roles, but when I expressed my confusion to the other kids, they didn't get it at all."
"Congratulations! You've made it so far, good luck on an uncomplicated delivery and great care for anything that arises!"
"There's been a few.  Most recently (like 10 years ago), the decision to stop radiation therapy on my father.

&amp;#x200B;

He had fully metastasized cancer - it had moved into his brain and he was no longer able to make decisions. My mother was unable to comprehend that her husband of almost 60 years just wasn't going to get better.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember taking the Oncologist out into the hall and asking why he was doing radiation. He told me the treatment was palliative.  with a bit more questioning I found that the difference between palliative treatment and sending him home was a matter of extending his life by a couple of weeks and that ""it wasn't going to be pretty"".   I asked what would happen if he just stopped treating him. Oncologist said he'd feel much better and he'd die without pain in like 4  weeks rather than 6.

&amp;#x200B;

I told him he'd given my father his last dose and to send him home.  Doctor agreed. We went in together and talked to my father and mother.  I told them it was time to go home and enjoy christmas and that we'd finished treatment.  My father was happy - the cancer had eaten into his brain to such and extent that he though he was cured. My mother, shaken, asked if that was my final decision.  Doctor backed me up and we took him home.

&amp;#x200B;

He died a week after christmas sitting in front of a roaring fire holding my sister's hand.  He'd lasted 2 1/2 weeks, not 4 or 6."
"When you see one actress stick her tongue out as far as humanly possible and prod at the other woman as gingerly as she can manage, you’re watching a straight woman acting for men."
"""There is a fucking hickey on your neck? Are you 13?""

""Oh, I did that shaving."" 

""Really. And you expect me to buy that bullshit?"""
"“I did it for comfort and attention because you were focussed on yourself and ignoring me”

I had had a traumatic miscarriage and was recovering physically and emotionally"
"I was working at a church event and the person in charge knew me and my capabilities (which do not include childcare) and those of most others volunteering. I was assigned to the transportation of the materials which had to be carefully organized and managed. It was an intense job but again, the guy in charge knew me well and put me on it along with two guys I was familiar with and a very new member. We were all taking a load of supplies to the nursery where we saw a group of mostly women preparing to watch the kids. The new guy looked around, and then turned to me and said ""This seems like a much better space for you. You're a woman, and they look like they could use some help with the kids. I can take over this job."" 

Everyone in the room, who knew me well, turned and stared at him. Another guy I was working with said, ""If you think you can talk to her like that just because she's a woman, even though she's very much more experienced than you, I think you're in for a rough night."" 

He was immediately given all the dirty grunt work."
"Any time there's a baby that needs holding. No thanks man, I'll pass unless I'm the only one there to help."
"500 days of summer. Summer made it clear from the start she’s not a serious relationship kind of girl. And yet she continues to have something that appears to be so real with Tom. Because of this, Tom projects her to be someone she is not and romanticizes his relationship with her. His expectations of her end up breaking his heart when she doesn’t live up to them. That’s the realest thing in modern dating on both parts in my opinion. One saying they don’t wanna commit, but still makes it seem like they’re in something serious, and then pulls away saying they gave a “fair warning.” And the other romanticizing and falling in love with the idea of the partner they made up in their head."
Jameela Jamil and Kristen Bell
That probably really sucked short term but long term that sounds like an awful person to work for.  I hope you’re in a better workplace now.
"Oh oh! My first “boyfriend”!!

I think we were 11 or 12, but anyway, he was best friends with my cousin who lived a couple hours away in a city south of mine. I went to visit for a week and for that whole week all three of us hung out and I got a lil crush on him. Anyway, I head home at the end of the week but I get his phone number. The next night we texted ALL night, til the sun came up kinda thing. As the sun came up i asked if we could start dating and He said yes! I was so excited and blushy and wow!! And then he stopped talking to me for like a week... finally I asked my cousin, what’s up? Is he ok?? And my cousin says “hahahaha it was all just a prank we played on you!”"
"He was in his early 50s, I was in my early 20s. He said the age difference was too much and he wanted a more normal relationship. The other girl was 17."
"I have many cousins, 27 to be exact. A lot of them are about the same age as me. Right now I'm kind of lost in life. Been through some things this year that kind of just made me feel like I have no idea what I want, what to do etc. Meanwhile my cousins are working, married recently, one just had her first kid.

And I'm the one still kind of figuring it out. That being said, I do found solace in a few things. My grandma is very old and very disabled and fairly depressed (related to her son passing away 2 years ago). Right now my aunt who usually spends time with her doing the day travelled to visit her sons.

So I spend as much time with her now. I sit with her all day, I help her to go to the bathroom with her caretaker as she can barely walk since she was 35. Today I cooked for her because my other aunt who's the breadwinner here needed just a one day fill in meal for her. Do I know what I am doing in my life? Absolutely not.

But I consider that for what it's worth we are all succeeding in our own ways. I am succeeding by plodding on day to day, despite how down I feel and that at the very least I'm spending time with a very old yet very precious woman in my life"
I read this going man I hope they got... YEAH THEY GOT MARRIED!! YAY!
"It may be not be a healthy way of making friends (idk), but I usually just find a girl that I like and I think: “she’s cool. I’m gonna make friends with her.” She may be a coworker, a friend’s friend, a friend’s friend’s friend, someone who’s likely I’ll meet again.


I just chat with her, ask her a lot of questions, find out what we have in common, find the right type of humour that works with both of us. I’m trying to be easy on it, not too pushy, I stop the conversation when it was enough. 


I can pick up the signals that she doesn’t enjoy my presence too, then I back off. Sometimes *I* find out we don’t really get along, that’s cool too, I can’t be friends with everybody.



Sometimes I feel guilty about it, like I’m a concious hunter who finds her pray and just goes for it. But I made some great friendships like this. Also, I think some girls that approached me and befriended me made it some similar way.


Sometimes friendships form naturally by spending time together when you don’t have any other option, sometimes it’s a concious decision of spending time with her, that may or may not work."
"I was talking to my mother about going on an out of the country trip to visit my boyfriends extended family in the states. We were invited to go to a family event (we are in Canada, they had been wanting to meet me. Bf [26M] and I [20F] thought we were at an appropriate stage in our relationship to go).

My mom not only thought it was a horrible idea, she laughed and also told me that I have nothing to prove to his family and no status. I was one year away from finishing my degree and working several part time teaching jobs (I’m only 20). She said I wouldn’t be good enough for his family, and I should only go when I have something proud to show off about myself.

Hurts hearing that from my own mom. Clearly means she’s not even proud of me. I know that’s not how my bf’s family views me (they are very down to earth people and don’t really care about someone’s “status”, they are happy with me and my bf’s relationship). But it’s made me very insecure about myself since."
"Oh my gosh. As a woman in IT, I'm furious just reading this story. 

My closest story to this is when one of the case fans on my computer died and I needed to go buy another one. I stopped by at our local computer-parts store to grab a 20mm case fan and one of the guys at the store kept asking me if I needed help and whether or not I was sure I knew what I needed. This was maybe 8-9 years ago.

Another one was more recent - I started a new job and was meeting some new coworkers and this old man was like, ""oh, but you're a woman?""

It boggles my mind that there are more and more women and IT and somehow, so many old greasy men still can't wrap their heads around it."
wow that's brutal. did he say anything to you during the prom?
"Close! She's almost 6' tall and has them childbearing hips. As for catapulting watermelons out of her vagina, well that was an impressive feat I didn't find out until our wedding night 😉"
"Yes. I dont have children myself, but my sister does. Now that her children are toddlers, I can't carry them for a long period of time. (I have bad joints).

We recently had an event, and I was carrying the youngest for a little bit before my shoulder started to hurt. I handed her back to my sister and she is carrying her going up a steep grassy hill to get to the car. I just stare at her like how?

It really amazes me women that have more than one child and can carry them at once and no one says anything, but the moment she is carrying/lifting something about the same weight, they get asked if they want help."
Maggie Smith and Judi Dench.
Confidence and charm. A woman who is just being herself and makes you feel at home. I wish they bottled that stuff.

Shower sex. Holy crap. It just hurts and is uncomfortable. Would not recommend
"Guy brought me to a nature reserve, rented a boat and we rode down the river to another little park at the end. Whole thing took about two hours and then we had dinner. Things didn’t work out but I’ll never forget that. He didn’t even try to kiss me."
"Not really, just an awkward hello. It’s probably because as soon as he sent me the message I made it pretty apparent that he had sent it to the wrong person. I’m sure he was embarrassed but still didn’t make me feel any better."
"""I was falling in love with you too fast, I needed to do something to slow it down a little"" after I found out he was cheating on me with my cousin (who lived with us at the time and who was like my sister). From the same guy: ""I was jealous of how much time you spent with your dog"" because at around the same time I got an English Bulldog puppy and I wanted to spend time with him for the first few months training him."
"I feel like this is the exact kind of comment that makes a lot of people feel 'lesser-than.' Well, it does me, anyway. 

I don't want to detract from anyone who is really feeling this woman's brilliance, but just in case you're reading this and thinking, ""Oh dear Lord. How could I ever compare...? - - 

I *used* to be that woman. I had all my shit together, after working so hard for a university scholarship, obtaining my dream job, and eventually finding someone who brought out ""the best in me."" I came from nothing, and got myself to the top. I then worked hard to be the bastion of strength to all of the young women I knew. I became what I thought was ""the perfect version of me."" I ended up being a mentor to a number of younger women in my mostly male-dominated career, and even though I knew they'd love me no matter what, I felt a great pressure to be the best I could be at all times, to make sure they knew they could do and be the same. I worked, I worked out, I read, I learned, I took classes, I took time for spirit, and most of all, I NEVER let anyone know how depressed I was throughout all of ""my successes.""

The thing is... sometimes, being a ""Superwoman"" takes a lot out of you. Sometimes, when you're at the top being looked up to, you don't know where to turn when things fall apart. 

My husband left me for a younger woman, after lying about it. I changed careers shortly after, and had to start from scratch. I can't begin to tell you how much I felt like a failure, having been previously a mentor for so many younger women in my life.

I ""had it all,"" but then had to claw my way back after all of that fell apart. 

Listen - if you need to hear it, things can fall apart even after ""you have your act together."" You can still be brilliant when you have to rebuild. Don't set your sights on anyone else's achievements EVER. Know each and every single day that you're meeting your own expectations; that you're doing the best you can do with what you have, and cut yourself the slack that you cut everyone else in your life *who you love.* Love yourself.

Having your act together means you love yourself the way you love everyone else. Compare yourself to YOU and to no one else. You have no idea what others are going through. Love you first, and you'll be amazed and surprised with what you accomplish. It's great to think about how others have worked through their own shit, but honestly KNOW that they might have skeletons in their closet that you know NOTHING about."
"I married someone who also loves their alone time. We enjoy being ""alone"" together, like sitting next to each other and reading. Both of us also routinely travel/hike solo."
"
&gt;I started a new job and was meeting some new coworkers and this old man was like, ""oh, but you're a woman?""

""So, Bob, how long have you worked in IT?""

""Oh, fifteen years or so.""

""And in those fifteen years, how many times have you resolved a technical issue using your penis?"""
"I was on vacation, you're the one I want to come home to."
You should tell her this!
wow this one is my favorite it was so nice of him to spare your feelings
So what you are saying is she is basically Olivia Benson
"&gt; No, the rule is whoever cooks also washes the dishes

I thought the rule was that the cook never washes up? I’ve never heard it this way round!

I’m relieved to read that he’s history!"
Kinda like a heartbeat? Happens sometimes (and not because I’m aroused). I figure it’s just a weird blood circulation thing.
"And if you can’t buy it twice, you can’t afford it"
I asked a guy to whatever version of Sadie Hawkins our school did and he pretended to not know what it was. I was an idiot and described it (he was a senior - he knew). Still pretended to not understand. I realized what was happening near the end.
"From my mom: To love unconditionally 
From the woman who stepped up when my mom was sick: Everything else. Rub the dish soap in with your fingers if there's a lot of oil. How bread sounds when it's done. Wash your graphic t-shirts inside out. Etc."
"Whether or not I wanted to continue having a relationship with my ex/daughter's father. He was always lying to my face, more than likely cheating on me, and just didn't give a crap about me or our kid. It was a really hard decision, to untangle myself from him. But ultimately I know we are better off without him."
No ones said *maya angelou* yet!
"I just step up on the shelf thing at the bottom honestly.. I don't bother. It's probably gonna be my downfall one day. 

But really, I think this guy was just insane or having the worst day ever? Because that's an extreme reaction over something super small."
"We work near each other so most nights we have a drink with each other and friends before driving home together. We usually do about 20-30 mins down time talking about our day and feeding cats/doing chores once we get home and then one of us makes dinner (or orders if we’re lazy). It’s the clean up and throw on a show or movie. 

I always lie down and cuddle up and almost every night fall asleep on my SO’s lap. At some point he goes and puts the electric blanket on and wakes me at 11.30 to put me to bed. Mon-Thurs are pretty standard routine and I wouldn’t change it for the world."
"I never really understood how strongly some British people felt about Diana until we had Michelle. If anything ever happened to her, I would be inconsolable."
"When I was younger, I decided that everyone in the house should have a chore for the week. I made a chalkboard with all our names, (mom, dad, brother &amp; me), and  a column of what we had to do that week. For example tidy up living room, clean kitchen, clean bathroom..etc. 
My dad promptly let me know my brother and him would not be cleaning the kitchen because men don’t wash dishes. 
I’m still pissed about that."
"She’s an adult, doing a consensual activity. Who am I to judge?"
"""Do you like this?""

""Do you want me to [x]?""

""What do you want me to do to you?"""
I live in Tennessee. Can confirm. You don’t have to like country music to visit Nashville (though it does help) but if you can’t respect Dolly don’t even enter the state. I payed an extra $40 for a Dolly Parton license plate. No regrets.
"My husband always turns down the bed for me as I wash my face and brush my teeth before bed. He goes in and plug in my phone to the charger, turns on the light on the bedside table, pulls back my side of the bed covers. He’ll even move the book I’m reading so it’s easy to grab when I crawl into bed. It’s seriously the sweetest thing that anyone has ever done for me. So thoughtful! I’ve never asked him to do it - he just does!"
Reducing time spent on social media may help. When you’re bored and pull apps open to see them posting their seamless selfies that will not help.
That was so punk of him.
"On my face, daily, always without question. Rest of my body only when I will actually be outside longer than walking from my car to wherever I’m going."
"I love this question!  

My time to shine!

I remember in my senior year of high school, asking this girl to go to the movies with me.

She didn't say a single word.  Not one word.  **She simply laughed out loud, turned, and walked away laughing.**"
Wow what did your mom say? Mine would've lost it it on him lol.
"My cousin lives in Tennessee with her husband and children. She and her husband have only been in Tennessee since college, and I swear their entire family will cut you if you say anything remotely negative about Dolly."
"""I wanted to know what it was like to have sex with someone else, since I thought we'd end up together for the rest of our lives"" 

It was his best friends gf. He kept trying to convince me that it was okay bc he had whiskey dick and it didn't count bc he wasn't hard. 😐 his best friend didn't care and said ""I know she's a hoe anyway"" I was like the only sane person in the entire situation."
Aw this one makes me kinda sad. Its almost like she's been brainwashed.
"Carl and Ellie from Up. We only get a short period of time with Ellie, but you can feel her influence on the events in the rest of the movie. That, to me, always seemed like a very realistic depiction of healthy long-term relationships. The two of them made the other's life better while they were together."
"Don't blame the supplier, blame the demand. People just love to blame women for the stupid shit men are willing to do."
"Not an excuse but my ex cheated on me and when I found out he looked me dead in the eye and said “I’m just not sure how I can reconcile with this.”

I’m SO sorry this has been such an emotional toll on YOU."
Oh wow... this is just mean... sending you a hug!
"Any parent that manages to look boardroom ready at 7AM with kids clean and ready for school to me has their shit together.

I am single no kids and I barely manage to look presentable to go to work."
She died. She was a drug addict.
"I was painfully shy in high school when it came to boys. I was also fat and frumpy which make it harder. I hit it off with this punk boy my senior year and being a punk girl myself I was like, oh yes true love. Somehow I got over 17 years of crippling shyness to ask him to prom via making a mixed CD for him with the question in there. He turned me down but said it was because ""prom was for sellouts"" or something along those lines.    I am still thankful he gave me a good excuse even though I know it was because he didn't like me like that. We actually stayed friends for a while too."
"My mother (and my dad) taught me how to disagree without fighting or being mean to each other.  

The ""I feel"" statements. 

How to discuss money rationally.  

What to **NOT** say to your partner when you're angry or upset.  

How to say, ""I'm hurting"" without being accusatory.  

That it's perfectly okay for BOTH partners to go to counseling--together or separately."
"Technically from Grandma:

""Never, ever let yourself become financially dependent on a man. You never know when they'll up and leave you, or die, and you'll be left with no money, no skills, and no way to start over"". 

She spoke from experience. My grandfather committed suicide, because of that his life insurance vanished. There she was, a 12 yo daughter at home, three more kids in college, living in this huge house, she hadn't worked in 20+ years. It was 1974 and she just had to start over. They went from being one of the wealthiest families in their small town to one of the poorest overnight."
"I am a 5'4, 120lb woman, average as average can be. I was doing my grocery shopping and had stopped to add a case of bottled water to the bottom of my cart. This man ACTIVELY tried to remove the case of water from my hands. So I gave it to him and picked up another.

If I need assistance, I will ask for it."
"Riiiiight.... and in the actual future I bet he gets an urge to ""remember the past"" too..."
"Started my job last year as a management trainee in a male-dominated field. Every single time I picked something up, be it a single 1 lb bag or a 20 lb work item, I either had someone offer to carry it for me or attempt to take it from my hands. I finally snapped when we were organizing overhead cabling and one guy would just bump my hands out of the way and take over whatever I was tying up three times in a row before I told him to find his own damn job to do."
That's the worst thing in existence.
"Lesbian porn made for men tends be as shit and over-acted as straight porn. Lots of OH YEAH BABY YEAH YEAH FUCK YEAH (et cetera). Also there's dildo 'head' and a lot of weird spitting (which... fucking euw)

Lesbian porn made for women tends to be more realistic, and a little more understated."
"After Thanksgiving or Christmas for as long as I can remember, all the men would go watch sports, drinking beer, falling asleep on the couches after they ate dinner. The women would clean table, put away the food, make desserts or whatnot, and make sure the men were comfy. Even though they cooked 90% of the meals, and decorated and put out appetizers. 

So one year I decided to follow my step dad's lead and do Exactly what he did all day. I showed up with no food, didn't help cook, took so long to do anything like get napkins, or set the table, that eventually someone else took over. I stuffed myself, then I followed him to the basement with a beer.

Every time my mom called me out I just pointed out her husband and I were doing the same thing, as was my sisters husband's and my brothers. They were trapped. 

I ended up buzzed and fell asleep watching football with the guys. Didn't win any popularity contests but I did point out the hypocrisy to whoever made a fuss. And I had a good time. The men help a lot more now."
I do that too but it’s because I like to stress bake 😅
"I usually tell them to just imagine it's a 7 foot tall muscly dude.

They say ""But I'm not attracted to men.""

I say, ""And women aren't attracted to catcallers."""
"I asked a friend of mine that I had a crush on to attend prom with me.

He actually said yes to attending prom with me. Then he blatantly avoided me all summer. Whatever, I'd been rejected before even if this was more indirect. I moved on. Turns out promguy didn't.

For years, he was passive-aggressive. I later dated one of our other friends, who was promguy's housemate. Promguy would literally step on our toes, walk into us, even threw a pitcher of red koolaid all over the kitchen one holiday because he was angry that we were dating. He refused to tone it down and act more like an adult when we asked. He permanently damaged my friendship with him and caused great strain to his friendship with my now-ex."
"""She reminded me of a younger version of you, and the way you used to be.""

I was 20, he was 25, we'd been dating since I was 18."
"Yeah, I definitely wasn’t happy there. It was a religious place (catholic school) and I’m an atheist, so I never really felt like I could be myself there.

I had been there for almost 4 years, so I got a fat severance check, and less than two months later I was in a new job (where I still am today, almost three years later!)"
Dude. My ex tried to use this excuse at the divorce hearing. It wasn't cheating because I was planning on including you in on it later. Never mind the fact that I told him over and over that I did not want that ever.
My friends both got pregnant with sperm from the same donor.
"I have a similar story. I work at a printer and was carrying a case of paper. The repair guy said, ""Oh, here, I can get that for you."" When I said that no, I was fine, he still physically took it from me.  And then he instantly dropped it on his foot and said, ""It's heavier than it looks."""
'other men flirt with you' yes and I didn't flirt back. You slept with another woman.
I just became a mother this year so when I see an older mum surrounded by her older children especially those in their teens or adulthood laughing together. I knew this is one mum who brought up her children in a loving home.
Get pregnant and have kids as soon as possible because its my duty as a wife and a woman. Literally got told by my moms close friend that theres no point in me getting married(got married a few months ago) and not getting pregnant immediately after. I told her about how we dont plan on getting pregnant in 2-3 years time and was met with disappointment and judgement from her.
"We have a joint account for life expenses, and also have our own separate personal accounts. Those are more for unnecessary things, like when my husband wants to buy expensive seats for a baseball game or I buy an expensive pair of shoes. Then we won't need to check with each other about such a large purchase, because it's coming from our own accounts."
"Guys are more afraid of being thought gay if they do that.  Unfortunate, but true.   Among women, it's not generally assumed to be an expression of interest -- so much so that I've heard lesbians say that their serious flirting is often assumed to be mere friendly politeness.  

""NO, you are SO HOT that I want to have SEX with you.""  

""Oh, you're so nice!  Thank you! Love your hair!"""
You say that like Gaston isn't there...
"She has bodies in her basement, guaranteed. 

Which is also impressive because that's one more thing to juggle."
"My SIL volunteering me to be a surrogate for her and my brother’s child, despite her not having any reproductive or health issues (while I have both) and never having talked about it ever before. 

I’m a woman so obviously I should be willing to carry their kid!!! 

But in the same breath my brother told me my body wouldn’t be good for pregnancy because my hips are not “very wide.”"
"This \^, I get it sometimes when I'm turned on by something but i get it most when wearing tight jeans or real denim jean shorts that ride up and press against my crotch (when sitting in particular)"
"Came here because this is honestly such a good question and I can’t wrap my head around it either.

I’ve grown to love being alone, I work in customer service and after an eight hour shift I can’t stand to be in the same room as any human being."
"When my mother was giving me the sex talk she made one point that sticks with til this day:

* sleep with a man before you marry him so you know if you'll be satisfied the rest of your life

understandably we're not the most conservative or strict family"
It's probably like weight training the thing starts out at like 8 pounds and slowly gets bigger and they just get used to it.
Sherry lewis... Remember lamb chop?
"This happened just yesterday:

I live in a houseshare with one other girl. Our boiler started acting up a few days earlier so I did some googling and diagnosed the problem as low pressure (it was blatant - pressure gauge all the way down in the red), and found a youtube tutorial with the exact quick solution. Flatmate meanwhile was hectically texting ""all her male friends"", begging me not to touch the boiler in case I break it/it explodes under my unqualified female hands. I ignored her and repressurised the old thing, and voila it is fixed. The flatmate demanded that the boiler be serviced regardless, but since I'm the leaseholder I refused to contact the landlord about it. She's still very upset and not talking to me ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
"""I knew you weren't ready to open the relationship so I didn't tell you about it""

I did actually see the despair enter his eyes as he said it aloud and realised how stupid it was"
"All my female relatives/friends trying to pass off their babies for me to take care of instead of my male friends/relatives. They haven't done that since I dropped one, though. (By accident, I swear. The baby was fine.)"
"Pursuing my dream or getting a stable, well-paid job to support my family. I chose the second and have never regretted my decision."
"One time I was applying for internships and my husband was playing video games. My MIL walks over to me and asks me to make my husband a sandwich. I got up, made myself a sandwich, and then sat down."
"I have found my friends the same way one would find a partner. Because everyone could use another friend, a friendship pairing is way more likely than a romantic pairing, especially since it isn't an exclusive relationship. 

* **I have picked up female friends at bars.** One night, there was this woman who was super chill hanging in a big group of people. We made eye contact a few times, struck up a conversation, digged the vibe, and then I decided to get her number. I didn't have my phone on me, so I just gave her a piece of paper and a pen, she wrote down her number, and we said that we should grab brunch together sometime. We grabbed lunch and became great friends for years. 
* **I have been picked up as a friend at random places.** One of my closest friends said she saw me at a networking event and told her co-workers that she's going to disappear for a little while because she saw me across the room and wanted to befriend me. Her co-workers were literally giving her advice about how to strike up a conversation and wishing her luck. Another one of my close friends said that she had a friend crush on me while we were in school and, even though we shared none of the same classes, she made it a point to reach out and connect. 

For me, having friends was as important as finding a significant other and recognizing that friendship breakups are sometimes more hurtful than romantic breakups, I decided to be very intentional with my pursuit of finding friends who are worth the social risk."
"So at a job I have since quit, I asked for a raise because I was doing the front desk supervisor and assistant general managers job will just being a regular front desk agent. I asked thinking the worst the acting gm at the time could say was no. 

He proceeded to not just tell me no, but to tell me ""you do nothing around here to deserve a raise"" and then laugh at me for asking. He then left for lunch. So I picked up all the accounts billing I was working on. When he got back I sat it on his desk and said ""since I don't do anything to deserve a raise I'm sure you'll have no problem with doing the accounts receivable, looking over audit packets from the previous night, and handling guest complaints."" (Since none of this was in my job description). He then complained about me to another front desk agent. I just laughed at this point because otherwise I would've flipped shit I was so pissed."
"Yeah I said ""the only person I know who drinks coffee is my dad, and he does it himself"". I wish I'd been less polite, but I was only 15."
"I tried to negotiate for $2k more for a job offer and the offer was rescinded. It was really rough at the time but in hindsight I dodged a bullet and after being in the workforce for 10+ years now, I know I didn’t do anything wrong and their reaction was totally inappropriate."

"When I worked at a national hardware store after high school, I used to ask people if they needed help and they would insist to talk to a male coworker but if they saw me hauling and loading shit on and off a cart to scan like bags of mulch or pavers or wood or whatever, then they would literally stand there and watch me until I was done. Used to piss me off so much."
"My cousin and I started out with similar resources, in all the same music lessons, advanced math classes, etc. But he got in with a crowd that tried recreational drugs in high school (weed, LSD, ecstasy) and I didn’t. 

The friends went on to lead productive lives while occasionally getting high. My cousin couldn’t stop. 

I went on to a good university, got a degree, and got a great job in a lucrative industry. He went to community college for a bit before dropping out. He continued to use harder and harder substances. 

After about a decade of being in and out of hospitals, multiple stints in rehab, counseling, familial support, everything you could think of being available to you when you have loving parents with large resources, he’s still not sober. My aunt and uncle finally had to make the decision to kick him out, so now he’s a homeless drug addict. We never know where he is now, and when we hear from him, it’s usually because him calling from an unknown number, trying to extort money.

It shaped the way I view drugs and recreational drug use."
"This is just so amazingly stupid on so many levels. Why have pictures at all? Why keep them in the sock drawer, especially if you're doing his laundry? Why write dates on them?! I mean... cheating aside that guy was too dumb to date."
"Don’t worry. We all liked a guy like that once and then we discovered under their good looks, there was nothing good about them. Not just that they were mean, but that they really had nothing in their personality that would recommend them to anyone."
"We were at a party alone in the kitchen secretly kissing when we decided to get back to everyone else before things seemed suspicious. We leaned in for one more kiss almost all the way and my eyes were closing when our lips were almost touching and then he whispered ""be patient you'll get more later"" and then pulled away without a kiss. I about fell over, he left me wanting so much more."
"We went on a pizza tour around Chicago, sampling a slice at 3 or 4 different restaurants (all deep dish!), then went to a bar of his choice (new, neither of us had been), and finally a bar of my choice (an old favorite). It was much longer than I anticipated and was the perfect kickoff to our relationship. Still together almost 5 years later."

"I asked for a raise when taking over a supervisor position after the supervisor left. I asked for the low range on the company website for that position. Boss stormed out of the office swearing. Later sent and email to the whole team about the specific salary I asked for. Saying how I was so ungrateful and he should just fire our whole department. Then he called to tell me I was fired. But then he came back later to ""take it back"" and gave me a raise. I didn't stay long after that."
this happened years ago but it still stings. Was talking to him via FB and after I popped the question I noticed he didn’t respond. So I refreshed and the chat box said “Facebook user”

(I grew up poor and have a hard time making ends meet sometimes) Car insurance doesn't affect your credit. If you're running low on funds you technically have a full month after your due date to pay your insurance payment before they terminate your coverage. not recommended but a good thing to know

"I told my grandmother I was doing a master's degree and she started crying and said no man would ever love me.

"Showed up in a crisp white shirt driving a shiny black car. Turned right against a no-right-turn sign and got immediately pulled over and ticketed. He couldn't follow the cop so I had to translate.  Then he got lost along the way, but eventually found his way to a lake at the foot of Mount Fuji, where we hung out until dawn. We didn't even kiss. 

Married him."
"My neighbor, who was easily in his late 80s, was struggling immensely to move these plastic buckets down a hill and into his backyard from our subdivision parking lot. He dropping them, stopping to rest, and even fell a couple times. I walked outside, brought him a glass of water, and asked if I could help. He asked me if my husband was home. I said no, but please let me help you. We went back and forth until I picked up one of the buckets.

I was expecting them to be full of gravel or something given what a hard time he was having. Nope. Mushroom compost (lighter and loamier than regular potting compost). Those buckets couldn't have been more than 8 pounds each. He had 6 of them, and I just straight up stacked them all up my arms and carried them into his yard with no trouble while he followed me muttering about independent women these days."
"This stems down to fundamental confidence issues within you. Really need to start appreciating what you do have instead of worrying about what you don’t - after all this is how you will look for the rest of your life, being comfortable in your own skin is the best thing you can do for yourself. Looks aren’t the be all or end all, and I think you’ll realise that the more you let go of these worries. Look at yourself in the mirror, be proud and rock whatever you’ve got!"

Very similar to ""love yourself or no one else will"" I just appreciated this advice more because she truly lives it every day of her life. She's very inspiring to me."
"Mine was the taxi driver who told me I should learn how to iron for my husband. 

So I’m in this taxi while travelling for work and for some reason the driver ended up talking about ironed shirts - I forget why but I think it had something to do with a business he used to run.

I said: let me stop you there, I know nothing about ironing.

And he... didn’t believe me. Surely I knew how. And then he asked me: what would I do if my husband said he had a shirt that needed ironing? 

So I told him that I’d say: “Hey I think we need to take you to the doctor to get your amnesia checked out as you seem to have forgotten that you can iron and I can’t.” And that my husband does MY ironing. 

(I neglected to pull him up on the while assuming I had a husband part, unfortunately.) 

So then he goes on and on about how I should learn to iron. I asked him why I would bother when my husband is the only person in my house who ever needs anything ironed and is perfectly capable of doing it himself. And he just kept saying: but don’t you want to do this for your husband? No, I don’t want to do this on account of me happening to have ovaries.

Strange how nobody ever wants to have this argument about welding or soldering irons or any other kind of hot metal shebang."

My ex and I kept our relationship a secret. One day we were making out and a person was coming closer so he sorta pushed me against a wall and hid me till the person left. Then started making out with me again it felt amazing feeling all of him against me like that with the solid wall behind. I still enjoy making out against walls to this day.

One of my friend's dads even yelled at us because I asked why only the daughter (my friend) had to clean when the son was let to do whatever whenever."
I know a couple who took turns. They used the same donor and IVF. They took the egg from one of them and then it was implanted in the other. I thought it was a neat idea.
"I do! I had to have a minor surgery/stitches to remove skin cancer in my back when I was 18. I was a runner for a long time and didn’t always wear sunscreen, which was dumb, because I’m a pale Finnish red head living in Los Angeles. I’m the poster child of someone who NEEDS to wear sunscreen every day! I dislike that I’ve become a lot paler since wearing sunscreen daily (weirdly enough, I would tan pretty well), but that’s a small price to pay to be cancer-free."
He could've at least apologized.
"Once I was getting gas right next to my apartment, and this gas station in particular is very popular because it’s on the college campus but just on the outside so you get lots of random people. I was filling up my car when I noticed a man sauntering over to me, and I just knew he was about to engage in some kind of ridiculous convo.


He goes “I was going to offer to get your gas for you, but you started it so fast!” and I didn’t really know what to say and he continues with “you really shouldn’t be filling up the gas yourself. you’re too beautiful for that, the gas will hurt your skin.” I told him I was just fine doing it on my own, and he basically repeated himself again going on about how it’s dangerous for me to be doing it and I should have a man do it for me 😂


He started walking away, turned back, and asked “do you have a boyfriend?” I said yes, and he told me my boyf should get gas with me next time. Total yikes lol"
I love that they immedietely shut him the fuck down.
"Wrapping his arm around my waist, lifting me up to wrap my legs around him and carrying me to the bed. Not a question... just a clear want. I’ve never felt sexier."
"69ing, it’s uncomfortable imo"
"Girl (boy), fuck your mom’s shitty attitude. I’m proud of you for finding a career, finding a boy from a nice family, and being able to analyze your mom’s drama with appropriate detachment. You rock!"
"Feelings? Nah, I don't think so. Thought someone was attractive? Yeah.

If I find them attractive, I try to distance myself because I don't want to play with fire. I really value loyalty, honesty, and respect. I wouldn't want my partner to develop feelings for someone else so I do the same. I had someone dump me for someone else and it hurt really bad. I couldn't inflict that pain on a person I care about.

Also, my husband is like my dream man so other men don't really compare in my eyes lol. 10/10 looks and personality.

(Btw, I don't think negatively about someone if it happens. It's natural. If they act on it, I get bitter about it because I feel bad about the other person.)"
"I have a female friend that insists there's never a reason to get induced or have a csection because ""your body knows what to do"". People used to die because their bodies didnt know what to do Susan."
I know that I should but I do not.  I will wear it if I am going to be hiking or swimming or spending a lot of time outdoors.  Otherwise since I am inside from 9-5 most of the week I don't really think about it.
“I’m depressed”
"I left our son with my husband for a weekend so I could go do a bunch of wedding stuff (weren't married yet). It also happened to be the weekend of a family party, so I went to that. Every fucking male family member looked at me super confused and asked, ""Wait, where is your boy if you're here?"" I kept saying, ""he's got a dad!"" And then they would say, ""Well yeah, but doesn't he get the weekend off?"" I guess because I am a stay at home mom I have to be glued to my kid until he is 18. 🙄"
That doesn’t even make sense. Isn’t it traditionally the woman’s job to run the house hold and keep the bills paid and figurative and literal lights on? Traditionally the husband goes out and makes money which the woman uses to keep everyone fed and everything running. You hear stories of husbands who lose their wives and don’t know how anything gets done in the house.
Welcome to the South
I don't mind the casting and The Little Mermaid was my favorite movie growing up. I do wish that Disney would stop all of these live-action remakes though. There are a lot of good fairy tales to adapt to the screen.
"Someone who graciously, compassionately, and confidently handles conflicts/stress/changes... that is so absolutely admirable to me and I strive to be that composed and caring! Even in the most difficult situations"
ATHLEISUREEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!
"I used to love being alone until my last boyfriend. Now I need to learn to get back to how I was before! Don’t get me wrong I still like my alone time. But it’s not the same as before. We didn’t even live together but having someone to talk to everyday was so nice. Before I just enjoyed not having to talk to anyone. I enjoyed the freedom to do whatever I wanted. Nap all day if I felt like it, no one was there to judge me!"
I think it is very telling that that only right wing assholes hate the fact that she is a beautiful black woman.
"Anything involving food - whipped cream, chocolate sauce, the grape thing... it’s all gross and some of it will give you an infection."
"You know how people can do pub/bar crawls? The guy I’m seeing now took me on an Indie bookstore crawl! 

He did all the driving &amp; even made a Date playlist with a bunch of our favorite songs and artists. Every time one of my favorite songs that I had showed him would come on I got even more happy and excited haha. 

Lunch first, casual but nice seafood place right on the water. Lots of nervous small talk. 

Book store 1- also a record store, so we browsed books &amp; vinyls for awhile. Walked around the town after. 

Book store 2- more run of the mill book store. We browsed, he ended up buying me a book because he thought I’d like it (&amp; I did!). Walked around this other town after, progressed to hand holding (ya know, gotta slowly break those touch/kiss/etc barriers).

Book store 3- This store was an AWESOME sprawling used book store of multiple buildings, quirky art, CATS free roaming, etc., and I’ve always wanted to go. We found a secluded place at the back of the property and spent way more time making out than we did browsing books. Then we browsed a little, played some chess, and rushed back to his place for more kisses. 

Great date because we had bonded so much over reading early on, it was a unique date he planned specifically for me and our mutual interests, and everything progressed effortlessly and naturally throughout the day."
"I can think of this one time we were in his sister's kitchen, hiding from his little niece, and started kissing some, then some more, and a little more after that. It was fun and cheeky and I didn't think much about it. Suddenly he just took my hand, gently putting my palm against his pants and making me feel the subtle arch of his boner pushing against his jeans. It's pretty cheesy now that I think about it, but somehow it struck me back then."
"If they are nice in their actions, not just their words."
"Always carry a pad/tampon.
Never try out new makeup looks on the day of occasion.
Rarely wear foundation 
Wear dark colors on period days
And finally,try not to share your relationship problems with a third party."
"""Hey honey, thanks for washing my car.""

""No problem, babe. Just wanted to do you a favor.""

""...we need to talk."""
"You just made me look back on a memory of my life.

I lost my virginity when I was 18 to my long time boyfriend that my parents loved. 

I was standing in the shower the next day and called my mom into the bathroom (so I didn't have to face her) and told her I had sex with him.

I expected some sort of lecture, but she was super non-chalant and was like - ""good, you should check out cosmo - they sometimes have good tips in there. Also, if a man ever pushes you for a threesome, he probably doesn't love you.""

Uhh, okay mom. Hahaha"
"My SO and I were interviewing companies to replace our air conditioner, hot water tank, and furnace. One representative showed up an hour earlier than scheduled and my SO wasn't home. I opened the door, told the guy I was surprised to see him this early and invited him in. This guy asked when my SO was getting home about 6 times. He wouldn't explain the different products they had to me, wouldn't talk prices, specs, anything. He just kept asking me for water, awkwardly petting my dogs and asking when my spouse would be home. This guy waited for an hour and when my SO got home, this guy had the audacity to explain that he had been waiting an hour and didn't want to talk to ""a girl"" about ""stuff she doesn't understand"" because it would ""waste his time"". SO asked him to leave his pamphlet and get out. We didn't go with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, those 6 weeks we interviewed companies were the absolute worst. Just about every single male service tech that came into the house treated me like I was an idiot. We had one guy try to repair the furnace without asking us. He brought me outside, told me to stand at the air conditioner while he ""tested something"" and when he didn't come back after 5 minutes I found him in the basement with my furnace torn apart. He turned it on, I smelt smoke, he told me I was imagining things, our fan melted, the company wouldn't reimburse me for the service call and parts they charged to my card, I fought with BBB and them, blah blah, fuck Reliable Heating and Cooling."
"She blended her foundation so well that there isn't a line on her neck/jaw. 

Witches."
Wtf that’s really cruel. It’s never cool to mess with someone’s feelings but putting that much time into it is awful. It was a long time ago but I’m sorry it happened nevertheless
"Yeah I noticed that the beloved, wholesome, universally loved people (and I'll add Carl Sagan to the list) seem to be white men, and I'm curious why this happens.

For me the first women who come to mind are Betty White, Julia Child, Lucille Ball, and Malala Yousafzai."
"Extroverted people like that imo are really helpful for those of us who have too much social anxiety to go up to people like that. Some of my closest friends basically did that to me and I appreciate it a lot, so I don't think it's anything to feel guilty about."
I'm supposed to be insecure about my fingernails now?
Thank you for doing the legwork for me.
"My boyfriend and I had been dying for a moment alone all day, and finally when we got back to my place he pinned me against the wall and kissed my neck. That alone was such a hot move (he's not a spontaneous guy) but then he went to kiss my neck and I banged my head against the wall. He stopped, and with the most concerned face went ""Oh my God, are you ok? I'm so sorry!"" 

I was fine, and the combination of spontaneity + neck kissing+ concerned sweetness made me want to climb him like a tree. Woof. 

Once after a particularly passionate session, he put his hands on my hips and looked at me, out of breath, and went, ""My God, how are you real?"" I felt like a goddess."
"He doesn't. He told me he eventually wants to get back together again. I asked what he needed for that to happen just out of curiosity. He said I needed to stop being so resentful of his cheating. 🙄 I asked him if he saw anything wrong with how he's treated me and he said ""sometimes I feel bad but then I remember how resentful and manipulative you were because I cheated. "" He has zero remorse or self awareness. He's already out there dating and rarely had time to even call his kid once a day because of this. 🙄🙄"
Jane Goodall and Dolly Parton!
"This just happened. I spent like 30 minutes telling my boyfriend about the WORST day i was having like just the legit worst. Anyway after we hang up, first he asks me what dorm im in now because he said he likes to look at where i am on googlemaps when he misses me...a little stalkery but he actually loves looking shit up on googlemaps so not that all wierd promise anyway a few minutes later I get a call and its a cookie delivery. This mother fucker ordered warm cookies to my dorm because I was having a hellish day. God Damn if he isnt the best. Ps: the cookies were really good, i only had one tonight but they'll make a great snack later."
My friends considered family medical history.
"I work in property management so when I'm screening an application and it's a woman with a high credit score, a lot of income, etc. I'm just like... You go girl lol"
"They're lying and living in fanatasy-land.

If some big, unattractive, smelly, old, bertha with hair on her chin and rotted teeth cornered them, and grabbed at thyem, they'd be traumatized.

But they are imagining some attractive woman they'd like to fuck making a sexy remark.

They also can't fathom what it's like to always be physically weaker than the people doing the harassing."
Is your life a porno?
"Stress baking, that's a new term,  I'm gonna use it now,  ""No, no,no I'm not a stress eater, I'm a stress baker, but after I baked some goodies, I should eat them, right? right?"" :D That's why muffins are my favourite, while one batch is in the oven, I can eat the previous one!"
Betty White is the real fucking deal 💗
"I went cliff jumping for my first date with a dude from OKC. (Cliff jumping like, into a lake, so no equipment or anything.) I was new to town and he took me to this secret spot that locals go to and we spent all afternoon jumping and swimming. Things with the guy didn't work out, but it remains one of the best and most memorable first dates of my life."
"i never understood 69ing. if i have a dick in my mouth, i’m 100% focused on the location of my teeth and tongue at all times. i’m also focusing on, well, breathing.

i won’t be able to focus on or enjoy any stimulation given to me at all, and i’m assuming the situation would be the same with my partner, so what’s the point? everything just cancels itself out."
"Them: “you are a woman, therefore you should have pretty handwriting.”

"In my fiances' family after a big dinner the ladies will clean up and the men folk will hang around.  I hung around with the men because in my family it's the hosts that clean, not the guests.  I have no problem helping but it shouldn't be implicit simply because I'm a lady.

His family have come to accept that I don't do certain things simply because it's expected of my gender."
"I recently applied for a job that was a little aspirational, but not completely outside the realm of my experience, thinking I would probably just not hear back from them. Within a day, I get an email from the hiring manager asking to set up a phone screen! I spent hours studying up on the company and their past project performance and markets, so I would be prepared.

The first thing the interviewer said to me was “I just *had*  to talk to the applicant who had no experience, but thought they were qualified for this job”. Then I had to explain for 15 minutes why I had thought I could apply for this job even though I wasn’t good enough."
"Dressed nice with the perfect amount of accessories. Not too flashy, but not too modest."
"My cheating ex tried to say I'd given them permission to sleep with our mutual friend, we'd had a threesome together with her but I certainly didn't give permission for them to start regularly fucking each other behind my back like they did."

"Slightly related to your question, I just think this is a good idea and loosely fits in to what you’re asking. 

In the UK a female comedian is leading a campaign for everybody to ‘adopt’ a female figure. She said on Wikipedia the amount of women featured is very few in comparison to men and if something isn’t done now in years to come there will be a generation with no idea what these women have done.

She’s asking people who ‘adopt’ the women to be responsible for ensuring their Wikipedia page is maintained and updated"
It was nice actually! Made me a little unsure if it was actually a date (he and I knew each other casually before hand) but he didn’t move too fast. I liked him a lot actually.
"It's because I wake up between 4 - 4:30. Wake up, run, shower, make breakfast and lunches for three littles by 6am, then spend from 6-7 getting kids up and ready for school. 7am we're in the car listening to Blue Swede's ""Hooked on a Feeling"" on repeat for the 20minute drive to school. NPR on the drive back for me and I'm at work with coffee and a muffin for my husband (we work together) by 8. 😎"
"My old boss cheated on his wife and business partner with a 20 year younger employee and said the same thing because “she’s changed.” Yea wonder why, she’s only spent the last 15 years raising your 3 children and starting the company you’ve made the fortune you didn’t get gifted to you from your mom on..."
"the fucking spitting though, i just can't. it's what ruined porn forever for me, there's never any warning."
"His Bumble bio was just ""Looking for a concert or beach buddy, then I'm your guy."" So I responded with ""Hi, I need a concert buddy."" Just to get conversation going. Ya know, an icebreaker. He responded with- ""That's great. Wanna see Foo Fighters tonight?""

Consider the ice fully shattered.

I was faced with a bit of a pickle. We'd never talked before, what is above is all we ever messaged in app.  So I didn't know if we had any shared interests, if he was a creep, what he was looking for, wither this was all legit or not. The 4 photos he had weren't all that great. I was worried. I had to just trust my gut and messaged back- ""I'm in."" 

We both ran late and had trouble finding each other. It turns out he works in music and several of his co-workers were there. I was nervous about it (my last real ex had isolated me from almost everyone in his life) but it wasn't like that. He introduced me with no qualms at all.  He even brought a spare pair of ear plugs for me. The concert was great but he leaned down and said he it was hard to get to know me there. So we went to a patio and talked over beers till it closed down. From there we walked to my favourite view of the city.  He waited until my Uber showed up and didn't make me feel pressured to kiss him or anything. Never the less, I gave him a big hug and thanked him for what had been one of the coolest dates I'd ever been on. 

Our anniversary of that date is on Friday next week, and I'ma tell you something Reddit. I couldn't be more in love."
"I work for this woman, even damm occasion or event she had the perfect accessory, jacket, scarf, gloves etc. she hand writes thank you notes and doesn’t over do it on the jewelry. Everything is in perfect proportions, she is magical and I feel like a scrub next to her."
Aww man I was also given that advice when I was a teenager but I plucked mine anyway. Your mum was right - mine never grew back properly!
"You body doesn't stop growing until your mid twenties.  The weight you gain in your late teens to early twenties isn't ""getting fat"" or ""the freshman 15,"" it's your body still growing and you aren't meant to weigh what you weigh at 18 for your entire adult life."
Meanwhile my unibrow growing everywhere like weeds
That's exactly what it is IMO. And once you get used to hoisting a toddler it's like picking up air to hold an 8lb baby again.
It’s depends heavily on the relationship with their sister(s). In my experience it seems that have a positive relationship with their sisters are more likely to have a realistic and “human” view on women in general.
"I remember when I went to best buy recently to see if they had some computer parts for my gaming PC the guy there kept asking if I was SURE I needed it and if I had the place I bought it from to look over it. It's a custom built PC, I needed specific parts, I said all I needed was an internet card and more fans and he said I should ask my boyfriend if he could put it together for me. 

I am a game developer, my boyfriend is a civil engineer. Sorry but he knows crap all about computers. I told the guy helping me I could find stuff myself and that's the end of it."
My husband listened to me when I said it makes me sad if he leaves without saying goodbye even though he wakes a lot earlier than I do. I just need to know he's leaving- and then I don't feel the slight pang of sadness when I wake lol. So he's sooooo sweet and he pats me on my shoulder and I will groggily tell him to have a good day and that I love him and he will be bid me fond farewells too and it makes my day incredibly nicer mentally and I love it.
"In ""Bridesmaids"", the way Annie self sabotaged the ""relationship"" with the cop after they spent the night together, he wakes up and offered to bake with her and she storms out at him out of the blue for no reason. 

I had have friends who do that very same thing."
Someone who just seems confident and happy with themselves and not super stressed or on edge.
"Letting go of relationships with my abusive family. I was raised in an environment where your family IS your only identity, so it meant starting from scratch. But it was worth it."
My sister is a lesbian and that’s exactly what she plans on doing so that they’ll be half siblings.  I think she’ll make a great mom someday!
Downfall with the shelf and food boxes on top of you.
"I asked someone if he wanted to go for a drink.
He didn't only say no, he laughed in my face for what felt like several minutes. Then said no. Then laughed more. Then asked why I ever thought someone like him would go for a drink with someone like me.

On the plus side, made me realise he was an absolute jackass. But I will never ever put myself in that position again."
"Many things. One is that relationships are meant to make you happier in life and that there's no point in staying in a shitty relationship; don't stay just for the sake of staying/lasting. She's been happily married to my dad for well over 30 years but she would divorce him if they didn't have a fulfilling marriage based on mutual respect and love (I'm not talking about giving up at the first rough patch here). My husband shares that view as well, so I hope we can transmit it to our hypothetical kids, regardless of gender."
"Holy shit what is it with abusive men and dog jealousy - For the rest of my life, I’ll never unsee the image of my dog curled up and sleeping peacefully on the couch while this guy is pointing at him and screaming “THIS IS ALL YOU CARE ABOUT!” It really haunts me tbh. Some people need serious help."
"Bob and Linda Belcher. Not a romantic show, but Linda and Bob are relationship goals. After 10+ years and raising three kids together, they're still in love and happy with each other. Their marriage subverts a lot of the common marriage tropes (Simpsons, Family Guy, etc.) where Linda is usually the 'wild, crazy' spouse to Bob's 'common sense, deadpan,' but as the show goes on, they take turns in being the wild and common sense one. Sometimes, they're both idiots and others, responsible. You never doubt their love and commitment to each other, and they're really funny.

A lot of long term relationships/marriages are either shown as getting 'dry, boring, etc.' Bob and Linda aren't like that. I love them."
My fiance knows exactly witch fork or spoon in the drawer is my favorite. He will specifically look for them when setting the table or getting me a snack.
"""Jameela is one of the good ones"" as my old friend Dame Helen Mirren always says."
Whether or not to get an abortion at 18; then having to decide on keeping the child or having her adopted. I chose adoption; hardest and yet best decision I have ever made.
"""Yes, and I'm a woman who doesnt drink coffee, usually surrounded by men who are capable of making their own.""

I love this line because it will really hit a man in his pride, I'm sure this would work wonders in making him change his behaviour.

"You know how you can tell when you know how to do something really well and you are watching someone who clearly doesn't have experience actually doing it doing their best impression of it? Like that. It's like watching a movie and seeing that they are desperately trying to check radiation levels with a kitchen thermometer - if you know better, you know better."
“She had her pussy out”
Biting lips (not too hard) and face/neck touching while making out is highly underrated.
"Oh God you're me! My groceries are generally healthy, lots of produce/tofu/whole grains/lean meat....and then I go to Sonic and get 4 corn dogs."
"Holy shit that sounds exactly like my ex husband. I found a photo of him on a beach with a topless woman on each side of him, his arms around their shoulders and coming down to cup a breast. He literally told me, ""THOSE AREN'T MY HANDS"". Like he for fucking real expected me to believe that some other dude was hiding behind him, sticking his arms out while my husband hid his own arms. Some dude with my husband's tattoos. 

Cuz being a huge piece of shit wasn't enough, he also needed to be a liar and a coward. Then when I refused to 'believe him' he hit me. Dude sorry you're such a coward that you need to physically abuse a woman who won't fall for your bullshit about some dude with magic arms. Holy cow. He's on wife #3 now (we are mid-30s) and they have a small child together and that shit terrifies me. With wife #2 he had a cocaine problem and got busted with a prostitute. He's a real winner lol."
"This reminded me of a story my dad told me about when he was a bartender. 

He had a buddy at the bar who he would have help out with a few small tasks on exchange for some free drinks, well my dad walked out of the back room with a really heavy box of beer and he was struggling with it so he asked his buddy to take it for him.

The buddy was prepared to grab a heavy case of beer so when my dad put it into his hands he immediately went full hulk mode to hold it up....but it was actually empty inside so he ended up smash and empty box into his own face."
Pulling my hair to get a better angle on my lips to kiss me.
"My wife couldn’t imagine the idea of being pregnant so I agreed to carry. 

After a rough custody battle for two foster kids we had for two years and losing them to their mother(would be fine if she didn’t loose both kids again — 3 months later due to her drug use). We decided to remain child free and truly enjoy it!

Good Luck OP!"
ok see i don’t help my husband run a dentistry or work out or buy healthy groceries with reusable bags or dress beautifully all the time but bet your sweet ass i can pull out a bottle of hot sauce or whatever other treasure your heart desires!!! i must be an amazing woman hell yea
"I'm a saddler and horse trainer.  Men are constantly trying to step up and carry shit for me.  Two recent ones, guy comes to pick up two saddles I repaired for his wife.  These are big antique saddles for display and each weigh over 40lbs.  He picks one up, struggling a moment because they are awkward to carry if you don't know where to grab but refused my help.  He starts walking to his car and says he'll be right back for the other.  I scooped the other one up and followed him out and he looked completely shocked when he opened the trunk and saw me behind him, saddle balanced on my hip.  Yeah dude, I do this all day long.  

The other was two nice young men I hired to move a bunch of sand saw me moving hay bales when I was pregnant and got really uppity.  Being pregnant I caved and said sure, I'll pay you a dollar a bale to finish, take your time and don't hurt yourselves.  They started WAY too fast and struggled to keep going through all 200 bales 🙄"
"As a 5'0 person I get it, but as a retail employee pls pls pls do not climb on those. They are not stable at all. They're just flimsy pieces of metal held in place by tiny hooks that go into little notches. They are not meant to support the weight of a person and you could get seriously hurt and bring the whole thing down if the shelf collapses. Sorry for the lecture, I just get so nervous when I see people trying to do that."
"I was 15 and grandma would’ve been like 60. During a grocery trip, it came up that I was on my period. I had been pushing the cart. She quickly took over the cart and said “You can’t be pushing a heavy grocery cart on your period. You have to take better care of yourself.” I stared at her like a deer in headlights. I was at a loss for words. She was dead serious worried that I would injury myself somehow specifically because I was on my period. She meant zero harm, only love."
"If you don't mind me asking, what do you mean by she is BUILT to carry a baby. It just kind of made me laugh when I read that."
"To be fair, when I get those pushy sales people nothing stops them quicker than ""oh I have to talk to my husband"" lol, but no, I get pissed when I have actual questions and they tell me to have him explain. No, he knows less than I do about it, and I just want to know what this new ""service charge"" is when I haven't changed plans or been in to update my equipment in over a year. What the fuck?

Yeah, we don't have cable now. Fuck it."
"For me, it's an excitement thing. When I was a kid, I used to get it when I got a new video game or went to a theme park. Later, when I started having sexual feelings, it happened then, too (albeit more intensely).

It's my understanding that many men have had similar experiences of getting partial erections from excitement, even if it's wholly nonsexual, like when playing sports or whatnot."
"Damn, there are a few.

One guy bit my lip hard enough that it was sore for a couple days, and every time I felt it I was reminded of him. 

Once I was playfully trying to push a guy onto his bed. He stepped out of the way and I fell down. As soon as I turned over he lay on top of me, said ""gotcha"" with a grin, and then kissed me. 

That same guy actually once came while I was rubbing the outside of his pants. He was super embarassed, but it made me feel like the sexiest person on Earth."
"I love Mariska! She adopted two kids, she’s never involved in any media drama, and her first date with her now husband (who she met on the set of SVU) was going to church together. So cute!"
"I'm the only girl (woman now) in an all boys family - my brothers, cousins ect.
To this day, in family gatherings, including my own birthday, I'm expected to clean the table and wash everyone's dishes instead of hanging out and catching up. I do this only of respect to my mom, that usually spends the entire day before that cooking and cleaning.

Then, my parents ask why I don't have strong relationship with my cousins (guess what, I see them about once a year and don't even get to talk to them) or will get a phone call from my parents the day after starting with ""so, we didn't get to talk to you yesterday, you should take more interest in other people"". I was washing dishes and cleaning while everyone were having cake and drinks.
Gee thanks"
"He sure is!! He pulled a knife on me when I was screaming for him to leave. I moved 3hrs away and started out fresh 😊 

He went on to have a baby with this girl, which CAS (I'm in Ontario, CAS is like CPS) took the baby shortly after birth. Apparently she had 2 other children that she lost custody of because she was an addict. I'm sad that my daughter has a half-brother in the system but I'm hopeful that he will have a better life than he would have with them."

"I definitely notice if people have visible dirt or just like...crusty, gross looking nails. But I don’t think of it by gender, really, especially since I see men with gross and I groomed nails WAY more often than I see women with them."
"A friend of mine has her boyfriend telling her number 2.
She’s white but he’s always saying “if I see a black girl I’m immediately attracted”.she asked if he found her attractive and he didn’t reply. 
Once she told him she was missing sex and he said “before you miss it you should get better. Maybe you should sleep with another dude to practice”.

I wonder how can someone have such a low self esteem to stay with a man that says stuff like this. And I also wonder how someone can have such a low self esteem to stay with a girl that he doesn’t respect/value"
"I dunno... I'm not a huge fan of reading (I enjoy it enough, but don't do it often), but I LOVE bookstores. I honestly think there's something for everyone, even if it's not reading. Like, I love me some mythology, or philosophy, or comedy, and any of those things as a book section could entertain me for hours, let alone start a conversation about them. Without even reading, or with light skimming, I'm already excited to discuss things I like."
Time to dust off &amp; update that resume and start finding a job that will pay you your worth.
I hope he still cringes over that brilliant argument when he can't fall asleep.
"Personally, I (35/F) like the straightforward questions for clarity, but I also think that putting them in statement form like this can be good too: 

""I'd like to kiss you."" ""I'd like to hold your hand."" etc. (Said *without* reaching for the person or taking other direct action.) This is communicating how you're feeling / what you want, while signalling that they can do these things (or counter with another request) when they feel ready.

If you're feeling really uncertain about how the recipient is feeling about the situation, a statement form might be good as it's actually a bit less demanding, in that the other person has more options for responding. Questions tend to create pressure for an answer, if that makes sense... I'm not sure I'm explaining this very well, but I feel that direct questions are good if you're getting the impression that the other person is very receptive to the idea, while statements are more cautious if you're really not sure how they're feeling. 

Anyone else think this way...?"
My in laws were this way with me for the first 4 years my husband and I were together. I would literally have to run away.  I held my own baby because it is my baby. Stop handing me yours simply because I'm a woman.
"Cleanliness, cleanliness, cleanliness. While she was a little overboard with it, it did pave the way for me to be cognizant or having a clean home, car, and my own cleanliness. It might sound dumb but I’ve come across people who have zero self awareness or just don’t care. Another huge one (which might be the biggest thing to me) is being CONSIDERATE of people. Their homes, their beliefs, their time, etc. Man, if we were all a little more considerate of others, this world would be better."
"A couple years ago there was [a really good article in Esquire magazine](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a55592/playgirl-magazine-history/) about the history of Playgirl. 

The bottom line was Playgirl struggled to find its identity. It was a magazine for women but its primary buyers were gay men. It was caught in between — too risqué for most women, not risqué enough for most gay men. 
 
A few interesting takeaways: 
 
* It actually wasn’t a Hugh Hefner-owned spin-off of Playboy! The founder had wanted to do a Playboy knock-off featuring naked women, but his wife convinced him to do a version of Playboy *for* women. Hefner had nothing to do with it. 
 
* What most people remember as Playgirl’s most famous centerfold — [Burt Reynolds naked on a bearskin rug](https://imgur.com/a/DsTb8xQ) was actually not in Playgirl at all. It was in Cosmopolitan and pre-dated Playgirl. But that issue was a huge hit and helped pave the way for Playgirl. 
 
* Playboy was roundly denounced by Gloria Steinem and other feminists in the 1970s, but Playgirl vocally supported feminism, abortion rights, and similar causes. It was one of the few publications of the day that catered to women but didn’t focus on housekeeping, celebrities, or fashion. 
 
* One of the, eherm, biggest problems the magazine faced in the early days was whether the men could have erections or not. They wanted to be, like Playboy, available on newsstands and appealing to advertisers, but erections would make them firmly in the hard-core category. In the early days they didn’t show penises at all; then penises were OK as long as their were flaccid. Years later they went to full mast. 
 
* Later it became more of a Cosmo rip-off, then — too late — finally started to embrace its predominantly gay audience. 
 
* Surprisingly enough it’s still active! Though the last print issue was Winter 2016."
"If it's fake boobs, women ""squirting"" on each others faces, and screaming at the top of their lungs, it's probably geared towards dudes. For examples, most Brazzers lesbian porn is made for men, whereas there's a ton of independent stuff that specifically geared towards lesbians, though usually with a much smaller budget.

Kink and Realitykings are both good compromises between the authentic and the highly produced."
One of the things to accept someone else being beautiful doesn't mean you are not beautiful too. Or that it's not a competition.
"I wear a 38DD or 38H(depends on the brand) and the fentyxsavage strapless bra is legit the BEST. I can wear it all day without having to pull it up or adjust it  once, it's comfortable, plus no crazy padding that bring your tits up to your chin. It also comes with straps if you want to wear it with straps or adjust it as a racerback. I thing original price is like $39, but they ALWAYS have sales where you can buy two bras or panties for $29. 10/10 recommend!"

"Thank you. Catholic schools aren’t exactly known for being warm and fuzzy, but Mrs. B enjoyed being downright nasty whenever she could get away with it. I begged to leave that school many times."
🤣🤣🤣🤣 god you’re right. Like cmon if you were actually having fun you’d be faceplanted in that.
"Asked my boss if I could work from home on a Friday. She had told me I could WFH when she offered me the job but I hadn't wanted to use it because I didn't want her to think I was taking advantage of her. 

She did anyways. Led to a whole awkward talk and me feeling like I might get fired for a week."
"yea she saw a demand and she offered the supply. some dudes are a bit jealous that they can't sell that to thirsty girls (or guys) because the demand isn't there, but then again you can't blame anyone for not being interested in some guy's bath water..."
"1.  ""You moved away. I have needs.""
 I went to college. I was gone for five days. His father, a ""pastor,"" called and said the same thing. 

2. ""My friend made the tinder acocunt for me. I swear I didn't even use it or talk to anyone!""  
 He matched with a friend of mine from high school who sent me screenshots of the match and the conversation he started."
"Yep yep yep came here to say this. If they're long or pointy, and enthusiastically going into orifices, I'm immediately turned off."
"I know how you feel and why you still remember it. I'm hurt reading it. I cry very very easily and only recently have accepted it thanks to my therapist. She helped me realize it's my body's natural reaction to some emotions and it doesn't mean I'm weaker - it's just easier to see what I'm feeling. 

But fuck this teacher. People with this kind of attitude cause people like us (I'm assuming) so much unnecessary anxiety. The lack of understanding feels isolating. 

Anyways, this resonated with me and I hope when you think of her you give mental middle fingers in her direction."
"To go to a psychiatrist. I was absolutely terrified to get professional help and to admit that there really is something wrong with me. It's been a rocky road but things are so much better now, and I'm thankful for my SO for pushing me to go."
Being kind is more important than being popular.
"my mom said this too. also if you're traveling alone, try to sit with another woman. i don't stick to that one like crazy but honestly i have sat next to some creeps in my life so maybe i should"
"How they treat people who wouldn't be ""useful"" to them.  I have a cousin, he can turn on the charm and be super nice to people, but he only does it when he's interacting with someone who would be of social/economic benefit to him.  Since my side of the family isn't super wealthy or socialites, we're pretty much useless as far as he's concerned."
Wow. Did you even respond to him saying that? I'd be dumbfounded.
"At least where I grew up men handled the bills traditionally. My grandparents got married in the 50's and while my grandmother has her own bank account, she knows literally nothing about their money. She's never paid a bill in her life, has no idea how much they have saved and has no clue about their spending.  

On the flip side, my grandfather can't do anything in the house without her. He's never made himself so much as a snack or a cup of tea and has never cleaned anything in the house on his own. He's never even bought his own clothes or scheduled his own appointments. So I think the stereotype of widowers being lost would hold true for him. If my grandfather were to pass, my grandmother would need an account. If my grandmother were to pass, my grandfather would need a maid, a chef, a personal assistant etc."
"5 years ago, when my now fiance and I were both students in university, he rented a car, drove us down to a cute little town for some yummy gelato, and then a walk by the lake where he asked me to be his girlfriend. 

Since we were busy students, we hadn't been on an actual ""date"" for the month leading up to that one, and it was truly just a great time that was the start of an amazing relationship."
"I was so angry at myself for ever trusting him. I was pregnant, too."
"In addition to what everyone else has said, the type of women is usually different.  What the average straight man finds attractive and what most lesbian/bi/pan women find attractive have some overlap, but the venn diagram isn't a perfect circle.  The perfectly made up and airbrushed women with huge tits are probably not cast to attract a female audience."
"When my SO and I were long distance, he recorded himself reading one of my favourite novels so that I could listen to him read to me when I wanted. Definitely one of the best gifts I've ever received.

He also routinely makes me pancakes and bacon on weekend mornings, so obviously, I'm keeping him."
"I mean she just found something to make money off. She doesn't harm anyone and if people are stupid enough to buy dirty water, so be it. I can't blame her for taking advantage of thirsty creeps."
aside from how brutal that is it's also kind of jaw-droppingly humorous. sounds like a cheesy line from a show.

He was mad that you went to prom together? I'd don't understand why he was so offended that you dated his friend
"That’s really beautiful that you got to have a fun filled last week with her. I know it’s hard to say goodbye, but you did the right thing."
"I remember when I was a teenager I was talking to my grandmother about how I wasn't going to cook things I don't like once I was an adult.  She laughed at me and said something about when you're married you cook what your husband likes and you eat it anyway.  I told her that if my husband wanted to eat something I didn't like he'd have to learn to cook them himself.   That made me laugh more.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I'm married I don't cook food I don't like to eat and my husband is fine with it.  Actually because of my work schedule, he's usually the one who cooks.  Grandma would be spinning in her grave to know that."
"I'm the successful cousin. All 5 of us are around the same age ranging from a couple months to 3 years apart. I'm the middle cousin. 

From my perspective I see it as a raising / opportunity difference. Somehow, my father was raised with a strong work ethic and drive to get an education and provide for his family. My aunt (his sister) was not. They both came from a very small (like ~1000 people) farming town. She stayed. Dad joined the army and got his education and got out.

My parents are very successful, were able to pay for my schooling (I'm sure I don't realize ultimately how much of a gift this was, but am eternally grateful for this), exposed me to different cultures and opportunities my cousins didn't have.. 

My parents shared some of their wealth with my aunt and her family (gave them the down payment for the house they live in, have given them money every Christmas for presents, helped them when they get under water with bills) but I think their priorities are different. 

My aunt doesn't seem to care about money management or education. Every time they get a little extra cash, they spend it on something frivolous like a new big screen or leather cut for biking. They've passed that down to their children who all (4) have children and lives of their own and are all struggling with money and trying to get ahead."
"I was taking a Lyft the other day and the guy started talking about riding rent prices and then went ""well you don't have that problem since your husband or father pays your rent"". He was truly shocked when I kept telling him that I somehow managed to handle paying my rent on my own."

Help needed here, too. Lol"
My friends and I would stress bake during college finals so much so that we started calling it procrastibaking.
"The summer before my senior year in college, I was volunteering at a 24-hour vet clinic about an hour from my house. I was there four days a week from 4pm to 12am UNPAID for 8 weeks (the length they wanted). I literally hit a deer on the interstate coming back home one night, and still made it in for my shift a couple days later. I think I missed one shift total (the one immediately after hitting the deer at 2am) despite my car being at the body shop for 3 weeks.

I regularly stayed late to help when it seemed like an extra hand was needed. I never said no to anything, including walking the boarded dogs or cleaning the bathroom. I knew it was all part of paying your dues so to speak. On my last day, I voluntarily stayed until 5am because shit hit the fan right as I was about to head home and they needed the extra hands.

Shortly after, I asked for a letter of recommendation for vet school. The vet responded saying she wouldn't write me a letter because she felt I had a poor work ethic. It crushed me. To this day, I don't know what this woman was thinking when she wrote that."
I would say that you are now an inspiration to a whole different set of women.
"Leggings. Then a weird societal decision to bring back seemingly arbitrary bits and pieces from fashion of the 80s and 90s. Lookin' at you, overalls and jumpsuits.

For makeup, definitely the brows. Big brows, sharp contour, bright highlight. I think when people look at the very end of the 2010s (late 2018 into 2019), it'll be a transition into the Glossier-esque minimalist natural look.

But mostly brows."
"Seeing a random man naked doesn't do shit for me. I am uninterested, and a bit repulsed seeing the penis of a guy I'm not involved with. A dude dressed in well-fitting clothes is far sexier to me than a naked man. Why pay to see a naked man. Makes no sense to me."
Would Julie Andrews fit in this list somewhere?
"Two of my friends did the same. They got a girl the first time around and waited about a year before her wife carried baby number 2 who ended up being a boy. A mutual gay male friend of theirs was kind enough to donate his sperm for both children &amp; is both of their godparents along with the woman he has been roommates &amp; business partners with for the last 5 years. I know that reads strangely, but everyone is really good friends &amp; the whole thing is surprisingly wholesome for how much they all care about each other &amp; everyone adores both those kids."

"Sandra Bullock, Betty White, Michelle Obama, and Amy Poehler all seem like they are genuinely nice women!"
"There was a really interesting piece in the *Toronto Star* a few years ago on sex work about how many straight men would start seeing sw to get pegged because they pathologically refused to ask their spouse about it first. I think one woman said she asked a John about it and he acted like she was such a fucking idiot like it’s just not *allowed* and his Madonna-Whore Complex is the law of the land, thankyouverymuch"
"I want to say, as a girl who did that many times, it was for me a result of constant bullying. The boys in my school year used to dare each other to ask me out, as it was funny to ask ""the ugly girl"" out (I wasn't actually ugly, just taller than usual) and then laugh at me if I ever considered they were serious. So any time someone asked me out I laughed and walked off as that was what I was told to do when bullied.

I never even considered that anyone was serious when asking me out."
I ALWAYS play as a female if the choice is available. I do this because I am a female. I know the male characters are stronger and tougher etc but I'm a woman in real life so I'm a woman in games. We have our plus points as well.
"We were 14. He went on a cruise and hooked up with two girls in an apparent threesome (no sex but everything else). ""Why are you so upset? I wasn't going to waste a cruise like that.""

It's been thirteen years (holy shit...) I've noticed he has the tendency to hop from girl to girl. The cheating never stopped. He's married now but I have a feeling it won't last. On their wedding website their ""story"" explained how they first met (when he had a girlfriend) and when they started falling in love (when he had a different girlfriend)."
"Hello, have you heard of wine?"
"Never nice to get cheated on, but you really did dodge a massive bullet there."
"Lived in a house with 5 other people all males. One of them being my boyfriend. All of them decided since I was the only women I should be the one cooking and cleaning up after them all.

Yeah, I am working two jobs because your dumb ass is unemployed and there are bills to pay.

I’m forming a mental image of what kind of drooling moron would say this and based on that, good for you for getting out of there lol"
"The Sex Act: *Jackhammer*

The Description: The guy thrusting into as hard and fast as possible thinking you will have a mind-blowing orgasm if he just hits your pelvis bone hard enough to consider going to the ER. 

Origin: Cheap Porn

The Sex Act: *Cowboy Style*

The Description: On top, facing his feet while trying to ride him like a horse and simultaneously have a mind-blowing orgasm if you manage to contort your vagina as if you just sat on the horn of a saddle. 

Origin: A book from the 90s written by ""Samantha Jones"" who we all appreciate being randy as hell but, quite frankly, made bad choices. 

The Sex Act: *Wear Sexy Lingerie*

The Description: Wearing a cheaply woven lace body suit over your genitals that only snap where you have the most sensitive pubic hair and stretch over your chest as if you are having a breast exam. The crotch rides up your ass so far you cannot sit, turn, bend or so much raise your arm without the lace causing excruciating pain. You spend the evening standing up to avoid your vagina being ripped in half. 

Origin: Frederick's of Hollywood, the original misogynist catalog for housewives 

The Sex Act: *Libra*

The Description: Both parties are sitting up while somehow the woman sensually manages to perform a cheerleader split and have the penis inside her. She supposedly enjoys having her limberness challenged while trying to achieve an orgasm. 

Origin: The Kama Sutra, which no one has ever taken seriously"
"Car insurance doesn’t affect your credit, but your credit can affect your car insurance rates. I worked for a major auto insurance company and we were directed not to tell our clients that. If someone’s credit score dropped, their rates would go up but we were instructed to tell them it was due to an increase in the price of parts for their vehicle. So sketchy."
"When I was younger I honestly thought the same as those men as well, until I had a coworker that enjoyed touching and groping me whenever she walked by. She was definitely attractive, but I had a girlfriend and had no interest in this coworker.

I don't think I've ever felt as uncomfortable or powerless as I did in that situation. I didn't think I COULD feel that way. I was scared to tell my girlfriend in case she thought I'd done something to warrant the behaviour, I was scared to tell my male coworkers as they would just laugh it off.

It's so easy to trivialize these experiences because, especially as a male, when you imagine them it's hard not to imagine yourself in control. When in reality you don't get to dictate any of the terms when someone else wants to touch your body without warning or consent."
This was something my ex told me too. We had sex everyday for at least an hour. It was just never enough for him.
"I was volunteering with habitat for humanity, one of the volunteers stepped on a nail and bled on the stairs (just plywood,  no carpet yet). While people were helping him bandage it up, the guy who the house was being built for looked at me and said I should clean up the blood because I’m a girl. The head of the site was not happy at all and berated him."
"The electricity in my SO's apartment shorted out the other day, and I was the only one who knew how to reset the breaker (he lives with two other men). It's literally just flipping a switch but I won't lie, it felt really good to save the day when everyone else was freaking out lol"
"Whether or not to have an abortion when I was 19. 

Decided to keep it since despite our age we were (and still are) very stable. Made plans to move into a house back across the country to be near my family. Miscarried anyway. I still think we made the right choice though"
Bread that's done baking sounds hollow when you tap it
"I've never heard this perspective before. I've avoided relationships in general partly because I love my solitude. The only relationship I ever had, I always felt pressured to entertain. It's really nice to hear that it's at least possible to be comfortable and normal around someone. Though I am afraid that my 'normal' can translate to being selfish with my time."
"&gt;He didn’t even try to kiss me.

Is this a good or a bad thing in your book?"
"YES. I have had more than one male friend or boyfriend say, ""I wish that would happen to me once in awhile"". 

One time it was a FWB and I had just come home shaken up over an incident that occurred maybe an hour before, where I was trying to walk home from dropping my car at the mechanics. A creepy old man kept driving past me and yelling things like, ""YEAH I'M GONNA FUCK YOU"", then when I tried to flee to a parking lot he blocked my path with his car and I had to threaten him with pepper spray. 

Men catcall and harass me A LOT, and sometimes it ends up being a situation like the one above. 

FWB told me I should be 'flattered' that these things happened to me so often. 

What exactly is sexy or empowering about the story I told?! 

That FWB turned out to be a total tool anyways with questionable ideas about consent. Imagine that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most men are never going to understand what it's like to be weaker and smaller and to have the larger and stronger people treating them like a piece of meat. It's not sexy. I don't find it empowering or flattering to know that random dudes want to stick their dick in me, and that they could absolutely do it against my will if they so inclined. It's fucking scary. Bottom line. It's scary."
"Same here; ugly enough to be ignored by most people talking to my friends (male or female) but plain enough I never got teased or insulted for my looks. It gets lonely, but for the most part I'd rather be invisible."

"Noise-cancelling headphones. 


My place is pretty tiny and my desk setup is in the living area, so I have to contend both with his noise and that of my younger brother, who is currently living with me. 
I used to do the same stuff as my partner after he finishes work. Take the dog to the park together, watch movies together, ride my horses together. I’ve come to realise that I cannot keep spending so much time doing the same things as him because I have different mental and social needs, so I’ve gotten into the routine of letting him exercise the dog alone or play video games while I study. I tend to now ride my horses alone or with horsey friends and it’s more rewarding as I’m not feeling the need to babysit him while he’s riding to try to avoid having him screw up the pony’s training. 

It was killing me a little to spend so much time watching movies instead of studying or working toward doing contracting work, and I actually found myself feeling a little depressed that I wasn’t being productive. It was difficult getting him to understand that I need to ignore him in order for the relationship to work, as he’s super affectionate and would never spend a day apart if he had his way, but it was having an adverse impact on my ability to be who I want to be, and there’s no way our relationship would be able to tolerate resentment if he got in the way of my goals. 
TL;DR. 
I need to ignore him and do my own thing in order to be happy. Some partners find this difficult to comprehend but it’s incredibly important to preserve ones own identity."

"It’s largely invisible labor. Men like that don’t think about how their clothes get washed, their kids get raised, the bills get paid, or the food gets made. It’s just a fact of life for them and they ignore the vast amount of labor that goes into it. That’s why men who lose their wives become helpless in those scenarios — it’s so much fucking work they always had the privilege of ignoring."
"Well said - and society in general has traditional been much more focused on the looks of a woman (beautiful princess, beauty contests, women's fashions, etc.)

BTW - #3 - definitely fits myself (male)."
"So many things. To name a few:

Pinning in general, whether it’s against a wall or against the bed
Simply telling me how bad he wants me 
Kissing the back of my neck, or my back in general
Being dominant and controlling 
And oddly enough, whispering in my ear, even if it’s not sexual. The breath on my ear and the slight brush of his lips against my ear is exquisite"

We're 7 months apart in age, both around 25.
My cousin is happily married, have a daughter &amp; a stable job.. while me, on the other hand, am batteling with depression that drags me down every passing day, am in a long distance relationship my family doesnt know (and will never approve of only under one circumstance), have a part time job that barely lets me save any money to *try* and get me a better future..
Needless to say, I am looked down upon because ""I dont have my life in order"".. and that hurts."

"Not exactly what you asked, but when I worked at a home improvement store, I had these two older ladies come in to buy something irrigation related.  They asked for some help, and while we were waiting for someone from that department to help them, we started talking.

The  were both widows who all their lives had their Dad then their husbands do everything that wasn't typical housewife things.

They had to help help learning how to pay bills because they never had to before."
"Planning all the office parties. In a male dominated field and they looked at me to put it all together. No problem when I was young and stupid but then got tired of it, so I stopped. Then they all wondered why we didn't have parties any more and I said it was someone else's turn to do all the planning. I had rotated out of the fun committee chairmanship."
"Honestly, it took me a long time and I still have bad days, but here's what worked for me:

\-I joined Brazilian jiu jitsu. Suddenly my size meant nothing, my thunder thighs I hated were suddenly my greatest asset (tight triangle chokes!) and I wanted to take better care of myself (eat, sleep, etc)

\-I went to a derm - I have adult acne and I HATED my face w/o makeup. I tried everything OTC and finally gave in. Self care is huge.

\-I came to the realization around age 27 that every. body. is. different. There is no comparison. We all have different genetics, builds, proportions, etc! It's like trying to compare apples to oranges - we're all fruit but we no two unrelated woman are the same.

\-I accept that I will never be a stunner, but love what I was given instead. I'm strong. I have broad shoulders like my great-grandmother. I have ""baby bearing"" hips like my grandmother. I have my mom's smile - all these things remind me I'm part of something beautiful, even if it's not definitive ""beauty"" itself.

\-I've learned to appreciate beautiful people instead of comparing myself to them. Like if I see a very stunning woman, instead of thinking ""man I wish I looked that good"" I think ""wow what a beautiful woman"" or ""damn she must have worked hard for those abs!"" and move on with my day. (See the movie ""I Feel Pretty"" for a boost. Beautiful girls have it hard too!)

\-Don't look at social media for ""motivation"" - it does the opposite. if you really want a dose of how screwed up filtering and alterations online are, head over to r/Instagramreality

"I used to work in a small office with a handful of men, all of whom were pretty close to retirement age, while I was barely in my 30s. So I would do things like change the water cooler or go get the delivery boxes from downstairs. Of course they would freak-out and try to help. But this wasn’t a typical ‘I’m also capable even though I’m a girl,’ situation. I was literally they only person in the office who could lift those particular objects. I started just changing out the water cooler while everyone else was at lunch ...and I guess they stopped noticing it was being done."
"Ugh not enough coffee and trying to do too many things at once. 

My wife and I wanted kids. I had planned on carrying since she absolutely did not want to carry a baby. 

We found a donor got everything set up and then an old friend of the family called basically saying kids mother couldn’t provide care and asked if we would take them. 

We got a 13 month old and a newborn we picked up from the hospital because BM(birth mom) was ditching him immediately after signing release forms for us to pick him up. 

We took two kids home and had them from 13 months to 3 for our little girl and from newborn to 2 for a little boy. BM got clean or so she said and of course DSS said it was better to reunite them with their BM. She got them back and shortly after failed a drug test and had them taken again. 

After this experience my wife and I made the choice to stay child free."
"In my experience, guys with sisters tend to view women more as humans, less as some unattainable, ethereal beings (or sex robots). Guys with sisters already know that women fart, have morning breath, and that our shit stinks just as much as theirs and so on. 

HOWEVER I think this usually only applies to younger guys. Once they've been in a serious relationship or three, they've usually figured out that we're all just people."
I always end up helping anyways because I feel bad for my grandmother and great aunt. It is infuriating how my uncles will just watch their 87 year old mother stumble around with a heavy platter full of food and do nothing to help her. My mom and I end up doing a lot of work because of that.
"They say that if you go to Jon Hamm’s hotel room, you get a much more serious ailment called “being split in half by his massive Hamm bone.”"
How could he forget that he had given you an extra key?
"Contouring and heavy eyebrows, definitely."
"It was a second date but he agreed to drive me 1.5h to a winery I needed to go to for a field trip (college, transportation not provided, no public transportation and I didn't have a car or a high enough class licence to rent a car and all of my peers cars were full so I would have not been able to go if he didn't drive me). After the field trip he took me to a local ""haunted"" spot because he knew I was super into folklore and ghost stories and then we went on a hike. After he took me to a nearby super touristy area and we went to an arcade and out for supper. After all that, as he was driving me home he got a call from a friend asking him to come to a party and he asked me if I wanted to come along and meet his ""weird"" friends. I said sure!  

2 years later we are married and expecting our first child!"
Probably the Skyrim Granny
"Gross, a master's degree? One thing I don't look for in a woman is high levels of dedication and intelligence./s"
"He said ""rude bitch"" tossed it on the pallet and stomped off. I kept walking."
It's was just sitting out there! The poor thing would've caught a cold.
"She had a baby at 19, and went on to work minimum wage jobs. I went to university, got two degrees and became a teacher. Don’t get me wrong, I adore my nephew. He’s a really good kid. But, my sister likes to remind me that I got to go to school while she didn’t. I don’t think she realizes that having a newborn baby can really impact your life."
yeah I just saw where Japanese girls are charging 900 a bottle for theirs
Not a rom com but I *love* Joel and Sheila’s relationship in Santa Clarita Diet. It’s just such a good healthy portrayal of a long term marriage which is great considering it’s such an absurd situation.
Lmao I hate hickeys. I accidentally got a hickey by a girl who was way to drunk for own good. I was essentially raped by this girl I clearly did not want her. I went home and immediately confessed to my girl. She actually believed me. I was the little spoon that night.
"This sounds like it could have happened on Baltimore city...but then I thought ""Girl, a lot of cities probably have a stadium and aquarium and a burger place close to eachother"".

 Congratulations though, that's awesome"
"Agreed. I think the guys who say stuff like this aren't imagining an alternate universe where women are bigger and stronger than men, where men begin to be harassed and threatened by women as soon as they hit puberty.

They're imagining our world, where a woman (most of the time) won't pose a physical threat, where they've never been harassed or threatened by a woman - or so I'm assuming, I would like to think men who have been wouldn't dismiss harassment like this.

They're imagining a pretty woman cat-calling them, and them not feeling threatened or harassed, but just being flattered because there's no danger there."
"Smart as hell. Obviously, there is a market for it."
"One of my favourite rom coms of all time is Little Black Book, solely for its portrayal of a real situation that I think many people experience. 

In the movie, two people are in a seemingly happy relationship. On the surface, they don’t really have many problems. Maybe a few small things here and there, but they’re otherwise content. Brittany Murphy’s character eventually begins to snoop - not necessarily out of suspicion, but sheer curiosity, to eventually realize that her boyfriend will never really love her the way he loves someone else. It’s as simple as that, and it’s incredibly heartbreaking. You can do everything right, but you can’t force love. And sometimes people spend years carrying out relationships, being perfectly content, while quietly, unconsciously suppressing their feelings for someone else. 

10/10 storytelling, I thought. The Carly Simon-filled soundtrack is also a delightful bonus."
Imagine being so presumptuous as to assume that a random woman you know nothing about even *has* a husband.
Yeah I wouldn't stay working that kind of person either.
"This is not really the same I guess, but I have a gaming laptop and when my husband and I were at a family's house I had it out because I needed to get on the internet. My husband's cousin's boyfriend then asked him if it was worth the extra money for a gaming laptop instead of a regular laptop. My husband proceeded to answer, saying he didnt think it was, that he didnt notice any difference etc. 

The problem here was that this was MY laptop, husband has his own regular laptop and not only does he not ever play computer games, he never uses my laptop at all. So it really irked me that he would answer at all instead of letting me, the person who actually uses it, respond."
"Yeah, my extended family told me my masters and now PhD will be worthless because I won’t need them once I have kids. I have 0 interest in having kids..."
"oh my god, that is so dreadful. i'm so sorry. you would have been well within your right to ask what kind of company has so much petty time on its hands"
That’s just...... out there
