"This is exactly how I feel about it! I see make-up like a temporary tattoo, it's turning your face into a piece of art for a day. I don't like ""natural look"" or ""no makeup"" makeup, if you're gonna put stuff on your face make it obvious!"
Naturally blonde hair. I LOVE it and have only put a temp dye over it once. I‚Äôve noticed though that as I age it‚Äôs getting darker. Boob:(
"Or it's really blurry/pixelated, like it was taken on a flip phone circa 2003"
"Just looking at them all, they all look so young. But more experience makes sense!"
Height is not apart of my decision making process when it comes to choosing friends.  
"‚ÄúHow come every girl on here...‚Äù

Fuck off."
"Called my health insurance company (number on the back of the card) and asked them to email me a list of therapists in my network, in my area. Went down the list, googled them, tried a few, stuck with one I felt a good connection with."
My GP recommended one to me. She had been recommended to him by several of his other patients so I decided to give her a try and it worked out really well. 
"Same, it‚Äôs probably worse in front of strangers for me "
'Looking for a partner in crime'
Googling brought me to Psychology Today profiles and I chose one near me who takes my insurance and had mostly good reviews. 
I think that's the website I've been looking at. There are so many. 
"Planning reliable transport and sticking to it is an important one I once overlooked. Had a date convince me to get a ride with him to a bus stop to save some time, and I stupidly agreed. keep all your interactions out in public until you feel you can trust the person."
Notorious RBG!!!!
It doesn't matter to me with respect to lifestyle and hobbies but I would be lying if I don't chase prestige in my career.
"I didn‚Äôt really factor it in tbh, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1‚Äù and my husband is 6‚Äô1‚Äù I fell in love with his sweet personality and his ability to make me laugh. His height is sometimes a positive and a negative, but overall it just *is*. "
Being a Republican.
"A staggering number of men around here put nothing in their bios except their school/program (we have a lot of students here) and height. Something like ""Harvard Law, 6'2""

It's soooooo generic and tells me absolutely nothing that I actually want to know. "
"I think there are probably IG influencers who would fit this (like Billie Eilish?) although kids today have it easier because there isn't that much of a demarcation between girly girl and not anymore because feminism is now pretty mainstream (like aside from ""GIRL POWER"" Spice Girls stuff)."
"A book centered around a man who treats his wife like shit, spends his days thinking of ways to emotionally cheat on her with a younger woman, considers scamming people out of money to run away with his intended mistress, attempts a suicide pact because that‚Äôs rational, then continues to live out the worlds most miserable existence with the wife and ex-mistress. 

These are the worst people and I have zero sympathy or care about them."

My boyfriend offered to split the cost of an OUD. I had never even considered asking him. I thought it was so thoughtful. He said it was for both of us so it only made sense. 
My friend was trying to break up with a guy and he told her not to because he had cancer. He didn't have cancer.
Me too!! What a relief when I felt comfortable eating whatever I wanted in front of him!

"My sister and my cousin are all less that 2 years apart, and we hung out as best friends. They were both more ‚Äúpopular‚Äù while in school I was the quiet kid. 

One time we were waiting at my house for a friend to pick us up to go out. (We were like 16) and I went to my room to grab something and while I was in there they ran out the door, jumped into their friends car and took off. 

Like, I got dressed up and ready for nothing, and then left by my closest friends (I‚Äôm assuming because I was awkward and they wanted to go out and not be embarrassed by me for once). 

But idk, I just felt my heart sink when I left my room ready to go and could hear them running out the door and laughing to get into the car as quick as possible. I felt like such shit. "

Just let him know it was pretty expensive and you like him to get some extra groceries or the next dinner bill out that you would normally get or split. 
"Around three months. He was hung up on his ex and didn‚Äôt want to hurt me by committing when he loved someone else; months later, we‚Äôre happily together and I know he‚Äôs telling the truth when he tells me I‚Äôm the love of his life."

"I went to a different coast for an internship and met him through friends 2 years ago on his birthday. At first, I didn't want to go because I had no idea who he was and I felt like I would be intruding. My friends insisted I go and said he was okay with it. We all hung out as a group for the next few months and it was super fun. When it was time to go back and finish school, I kind of has a crush on him but I didn't do anything because I didnt think he liked me back and I was leaving anyways. 

A year passed and I flew back out there permanently. I asked him out on a date and he said yes. He told me that he thought I was super cute the first time he met me but was super shy so he was afraid to approach me directly. One of his old messages before I left to me said I wish you didn't have to go. I totally was oblivious to that message. 

I looked at all our group photos from the past, we always seem to gravitate towards each other. Now my friends won't let it down that introducing me was the best birthday gift for my boyfriend 2 years ago and he agrees hahaha "
Having had extremely poor experiences with foot fetish men in the past I would physically remove myself from the situation as quickly as possible.
Since my husband had a vasectomy and we don't want children I would first be upset that the vasectomy failed and then get an abortion. I am 41 years old and have a 23 year old. I am not doing that again.  
That there is no non-creepy way and they need to not foist their sexual fetish onto a non-consenting person. That makes them a bad person and this is exactly why people regard foot fetishists the way they regard furries. Do whatever you want behind closed doors but at a certain point it becomes unfair to others to be creepy about it in public. 
What is it with foot fetishists and involving non-consenting participants??

"I've been (finally) playing Stardew Valley a lot lately.  I'd always gotten the impression that the game was most popular among women, but I was a little surprised to find that most of the popular YouTubers who play the game are men.  Which isn't too surprising since most of the popular gaming-related channels are by men, but then I started looking into mods and noticed popular ones like the one that turns all the romanceable male characters into women, presumably so straight male players don't have to feel too gay about giving Sebastian flowers (as if he couldn't use a little more color in his life).  Almost 80k downloads and haven't come across a gender flipped counterpart yet.  Kinda changed my impression of the fanbase.

Anyway, I still love the game, so it's no skin off my nose, but it made me wonder if there were other supposedly unofficially gendered things that I had the wrong impression of.  "

"Right, I understand. But he‚Äôs not saying the Black, Latino, and LGBT communities aren‚Äôt a part of the ordinary Americans. No? The bread and butter issues affect all of us...is how I understood it at least. To me it seems like he‚Äôs stressing the importance of protecting the minority by putting an emphasis on it - not making it a separate or lesser issue.

That being said - I feel really optimistic about 2020. I support Bernie at the moment (obviously haha) but I‚Äôm very hopeful about our pool of candidates this time around. It does kinda bum me out seeing people just pointing out flaws with candidates that aren‚Äôt their ‚Äúown‚Äù though.

"16 - My family and I went out to eat [sundubu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundubu-jjigae). I redeemed my free birthday drink from Starbucks (a venti green tea frap!) At the end of the day we all got some froyo instead of a birthday cake. 

21 - I went out for brunch with my SO. I ordered a mimosa and did not get carded. We walked around for a while after that, just hanging out and enjoying each other's company, and in the evening we had dinner with my family and my godfather at a fancy steakhouse (my godfather and I have the same birthday)."
"I voted for him in 2016. I hadn't done a lot of research about him or his records, but I liked his ideas. I genuinely believed he knew what he was doing and knew he had no chance, but it was an opportunity to get his ideas a lot of attention and nudge Hillary into adopting some of them. This did happen, but somewhere along the line he started to believe he actually had a shot. It was pretty concerning to me because he hadn't costed a lot of his positions and he didn't even attempt to formulate plans as to how he would achieve them. To this day I do not understand how he could say ""break up the banks"" ad nauseam and not be able to explain how he would do this. His inability to compromise also makes me believe he won't be able to get much done.

Despite all this, if he wins the primary, I will definitely vote for him. "

"GIRL, DO I EVER FEEL YOU. I love being moisturized, but I hate the process of getting there. Which usually means I go for days without using any lotion, until I hit a level of itchy that requires I slather some on. Sometimes my fianc√© and I trade off lotion-y massages and those are kind of great - I‚Äôm much more willing to lay back and relax while he gets it all worked in. Also, his hands are nice and warm, which means the lotion is nice and warm, and that makes a huge difference. "
I always wear sneakers so I have no idea why they would think I have nice feet. I don't think there is a non-creepy way.

Over-apologizing and lack of self confidence
IMO Obama did the same thing when he released his long form birth certificate but iirc he wasn't running for office at that point. I think both Warren and Obama's entertaining of Trump's bs were done in the hopes they'd be perceived as mic drops when in reality they were giving the baby his binky. 
"I mean I found out I was pregnant about 6 weeks ago so it'd basically be confirmation that I'm still pregnant. First baby was unplanned, she's two years old. This baby was planned and took much longer than anticipated to actually fall pregnant so we're very happy about having another kid. "

"The bar is low for being the smartest kid in class when you are homeschooled and only leave the house for the structured interactions that happen at church. Moreso when you parents have no idea what they are doing and give you a curriculum that is inappropriately behind grade level. Of course an average junior is going to find a sixth-grade level of school work to be easy. I always knew that my education was lacking, but with no reference point, I couldn't determine where those gaps were. I didn't think I was a genius or anything like that, but I didn't realize just how far behind my peers I was. When I graduated and got a job and started spending some time around people my own age in less socially structured settings, I started seeing the gaps in my education. I was relieved to see a starting point so that I could start catching up and I made up for lost time at the library. "

They didn't last long."
I agree with you on the basis that I‚Äôve been with an SO (male and I‚Äôm female) while buying a car and they ‚Äî not once ‚Äî acknowledged that I was there past the stage of them greeting us when we walked in. I‚Äôve never felt so invisible! 
"Or, I‚Äôm actually a capable adult who can assess situations that occur to me, compare them to other situations, consider various factors and name what those experiences are. "
"Oh my god! This happened to me except with a security door to door sales person. He asked me if my husband was home and to be spiteful, I let my husband go to the door and my husband says ""I don't know, my wife usually has the say so in these decisions and it looks like she's not interested""."
This. Honestly. Cause women can't know anything about cars.

"As a personal story - 

An ex-boyfriend of mine was so fucking controlling he told me that if I got my nose pierced he'd break up with me. He hated it. He said ""girls who pierce their faces are SO ugly"". I was taken aback by it. After we broke up, which was like a month later, I pierced my nose and I've had it in since!"
I've been with my boyfriend for a year and there were two times he made fun of my feelings (for me personally it takes a lot to honestly talk about my feelings out loud) and each time he instantly got SO much less attractive.

I think you should only do it if you're going to keep it super casual. You don't want to hurt anyone by getting serious while you're still caught up on someone else.
It's pretty insidious- often you don't even realise it happened until afterwards. The idea that a woman need anyone's permission- of any gender or relation- is ridiculous but fairly common.

"Yeah it's a stupid system. Basically they decided ages ago that One Person in a couple has to be designated as responsible for the taxes and that the default would be the husband, and never changed it. They're trying to change it so that you have the right to file taxes independently, even if you're married, but it's taking a while.

Even more bureaucratic nonsense: I'm marrying a(nother) woman soon and where we live only recently allowed same-sex marriage. They had to come up with a solution for the tax thing and in their infinite wisdom have decided that if you're both the same sex, the older partner will be the designated person. 

Sooo I won't have full control of my own taxes come September! I won't even be able to talk to the tax office without my partner's consent.

"We went to highschool together. We flirted the first year, but I kept pushing him away. I then went abroad for a year and he tried to forget about me, but he told me he couldn‚Äôt. He called his friend, to figure out what to do. And he never stopped texting me. Every day that year. When I got back in year three, it just worked. We got together after 2 months of dating. And we‚Äôve been together for 1,5 years since."
"Met at 17 through a mutual friend; became good friends and hung out together over a summer.  Had the best time.  But never admitted we liked one another romantically.  

School started in the fall and we lost touch because we went to different schools (pre cell phone and social media days).

I started dating someone from my own school whom I married a few years later.   He went away to college.  

Fast forward 24 years.  I‚Äôd been married since age 19 and was going through a divorce.  He found me on social media and we got reacquainted.  Turns out he only lived about 60 miles from me.  We met up one day for lunch. Nothing romantic about it; just catching up.  As soon as I left the restaurant I knew I had to see him again.  So we met up again the next week.  

This time we weren‚Äôt afraid to say how we felt about one another.  I learned that he‚Äôd always wanted us to be together.  He was just painfully shy about it as a teenager and he never thought I felt the same.   We found out that we had so much in common.  I didn‚Äôt have kids and never wanted any.  He‚Äôd never been married and didn‚Äôt want kids either.  We both loved to travel.  We shared the same views on finances, religion and politics.  I was amazed at how compatible we were.  And I was totally attracted to him.  Like WOW he just blew me away.  

This all happened 5 years ago.  We just had our first wedding anniversary this month.  We‚Äôve traveled the world together since then and continue to do so.  He makes me laugh every single day.  Multiple times a day.  I have never known such complete happiness.  I sometimes think maybe one of this is real at all and I‚Äôll wake up one day and learn it was a dream or something.  

I sometimes feel sad that it took us so long to finally get together; that I missed out on all those years... But I‚Äôm just glad it happened.  It makes me appreciate every day with him.

I feel like I went to your wedding lol. I was someone's date to a wedding (last year)  that had a similar story. Very cute!
"Erm... I'm not a woman but, I'm not sure I understand. Like are there people that put lotion on their whole body everyday? For what purpose? Like I don't if it's just me but that sticky, greasy feeling is so unconfortable it's one of the worst feelings I can experience, I never put any cream on my body, unless a doctor would ask me to and that hasn't happened to me as of today. Can someone explain that to me please ?"
The board of directors? Haha I love it!
"Pretty early on, but then I never really thought I was that smart to begin with.  I've had to work really hard to get where I am because of it."
In my experience guys think it's super weird and will think something is wrong with her. 
"Are you secretly my friend? I have some friendships like this too, and they're great :)"
"
""uhhh. um do they have a welder I can borrow?""

""Maybe they do. Have you asked your wife if you're allowed to use it?"""
Are you fucking joking??? Where do you live?!
"Yeah, with guys it's like they don't have to ask the women because obviously the guys are the one paying for everything /s"
I never did.
Reminds me of one time we were in Maplin and a guy was handing out flyers with the offers in. He let me walk by then gave one to my partner. As if a woman could be interested in such manly accoutrements! 
We hold each other totally accountable and ask deep questions. 
Co-op is a recent addition. Stardew was very successful/popular before co-op was available. 
Have your partner join you in eating well and not drinking or smoking. You want healthy sperm too! 
This has always been my dream to deal with that kind of stuff. How did you get into it. Do you need an electrical engineering degree or what?
Not being able to mind their own business
"I used to think the purpose of Tetris was to get the blocks to the top as fast as you can.  
I was really good at that game, I always won."
Constantly and when I forget it really shows lol 
Need to pee but all the toilets are disgusting/showers/the doors are too short!
"I was in a pretty bad car wreck. On the ambulance ride to the hospital, the cop who responded to the incident, kept insisting I give him my father's information. I was in shock and it took a while of him nagging to tell him that my father had been dead for three years. Then he asked for my mom's information. At which point I informed him that my mom lived on the other side of the country. Finally, he noticed my wedding band and asked for my husband's information. I told him I would call my husband from the hospital. 

&amp;#x200B;

The cop did not like me very much. He spent the entire ride to the hospital telling me that I was fine and I should have seen some of the crashes he'd responded to. Seemed to think the hospital was unnecessary. Turned out I had a fractured vertebrate and was in a back brace for 3 months. I did not like that cop very much."
This reveals a lot more about this women as she probably likes to.
"Not much. I do want a better job, but I don't think about prestige, but about being able to make enough to support myself. "
"So good!! 

I also want to be bold enough to just silently, curiously, stare at the person until they get uncomfortable. 

And then, if I am feeling particularily saucy, say ""Sorry. I just remembered my husband told me not to talk to idiots."" "
"Kind of opposite of the topic: my oldest son recently needed to start orthodontic treatments and had an expanded placed that needs cranked nightly for several weeks. I had to work the day he was to have it placed so I told the office staff my husband (his dad) take him to which they responded ‚Äúwell we need to teach the person who‚Äôs doing this nightly how to do it so it is done properly, can you get that day off?‚Äù Umm, no my husband will be there and he is perfectly capable of learning and doing this daily for our son. "
It doesn‚Äôt really. 
That‚Äôs so cool! Congrats! I got a girl too but was sure I would have a boy because of how ginormous I got and we never learned the sex and didn‚Äôt want to before birth. Having a daughter is awesome 
"Martha Stewart. I want to hang out at her house with her many dogs &amp; pets, drink wine and add to my recipe collection by trying samples."
I've literally never had an issue finding a boyfriend or fuckbuddies despite my numerous visible tattoos and piercings so your family is just objectively wrong lol
Freshen up my hair and makeup.
"After every shower, and before bed/changing into jeans or leggings and I see that my skin is dry. I don't use a lotion with heavy residual stick and actually use almond oil on my arms and thighs where I tend to get bumps of irritation and ingrowns!"
"Truth. My friends are very definite on their child free life plan, and the woman was trying to get a tubal ligation. She was in her 30s, she and her husband had been together 10 years, and they flat out refused to perform the procedure because she didn‚Äôt have kids or - more relevant to this discussion - ‚Äúyour husband might change his mind‚Äù. As if him deciding suddenly that he wanted a baby would overrule the fact that she didn‚Äôt. Instead he ended up getting a vasectomy. The only question they asked him was if he was sure - they didn‚Äôt even ask if he was married. 

Now, there are legit *medical* reasons why sterilising a man is preferable to sterilising a woman (it‚Äôs less invasive and less dangerous, with a faster healing time and fewer risks after the fact), but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that when you‚Äôre making healthcare decisions for yourself, you should not have to consult other people if you don‚Äôt wish to do so. You certainly shouldn‚Äôt be refused treatment based on the hypothetical future wishes of someone else!"
"That... is not true at all. In my experience at anime conventions there are many booths for female anime fans. Many body pillows of naked men in seductive poses. There are also a lot of women at the convention in general and there is a term for male waifus. It's called a husbando. Waifu is just an engrish version of ""wife""."
"Laundry. When ALL of my decent clothes are dirty then I'll do a load so I have clothes for the next few days, but otherwise? Coin-operated laundry machines in apartment buildings are the bane of my existence. If I could at least pay with a card that would be better but nooooo, instead I have to go to a bank and withdraw cash and get the cash exchanged for coins and then have ALL THIS CHANGE that's weighing down my pockets. Ugh. No thanks. My loveseat has been converted to ""the dirty laundry pile"" until further notice. "
"After every shower or bath, without fail. "
"Was on the verge of deleting Tinder after a succession of emotionless hook ups and unsuccessful dates. My SO showed up and after looking through his profile, I swiped left. But the app, as it usually did at the time, froze and shut down. When I went back on it, my SO showed up again after a few swipes. I looked at his profile again and thought ‚ÄúWhat the hell... I have nothing more to lose...‚Äù so I swiped right, we matched, we texted everyday for two weeks, met in person afterwards, were just friends with benefits for 2 months, but now we‚Äôve been dating for 11 months almost a year!"
"Do you guys plan on moving to the same location anytime? Not that I think it's necessary for a successful relationship, just curious! "
"""Unsolicited AND unethical.""  That's what I would wish I would say in a situation like this."
"this is weird, but eyelashes! I am blonde and fair skinned, yet my eyelashes are incredibly long and thick. Ever since the ""trend"" is to have an eyelash lift, people ask if my eyelashes are fake frequently.... (i.e. work, public, etc.) "
She heavily implied he was more responsible and a change might inconvenience him... I was stunned.
"Normally I would say it‚Äôs a bad idea, but honestly, I did that with my current SO, about 7 or so months after the breakup (I was with my ex for 4 years) and I most definitely did not feel ready yet. But my friends said they thought it‚Äôd be good for me... and it actually was. It pushed me over that last hurdle in the healing process."
"That‚Äôs not a valid answer. Birth control has huge implications for both parties. Therefore both parties need to be informed of any changes and pros/cons of those changes.

Notice I didn‚Äôt say  give permission "
"I wasn't aware that they don't. Might be cultural differences tho, I am not American. "
Ignore everyone. Have a plan. Don't do curls in the squat rack.
"Mine was similar to this. I was horribly sick to the point I couldn‚Äôt even muster the strength to sit up. I was staying in a hotel in my states capital where I‚Äôm from. I had went to visit my (still current) boyfriend who worked there at the time. I was throwing up on myself because I couldn‚Äôt even get my head over the toilet fast enough. Shout out to my man for leaving work to help me out. We thought it was food poisoning because he didn‚Äôt feel right through the night but didn‚Äôt have any throwing up or diaherria. As usual, just assumed I got the short end of the stick. So he takes me to the doc-in-a-box down the street because I hate hospitals. 

So I get signed in and whatnot and the nurse calls me back. She sees how sick I am and asks when I had a period last. I tell her two months ago and BEFORE I EVEN FINISH she says ‚Äúis that your husband out there? oh you might be pregnant! Morning sickness?‚Äù And I snap at her ‚Äúno if you let me finish I‚Äôm on the three month pill and kids may not be likely for me‚Äù. Her face went white and she was silent. I was so angry she just assumed things like that. If I was a women who wanted kids at the time or was trying I would have burst into tears because of her blind assumption. I do want kids one day but I was only 21 at the time. 

So to my diagnosis-severe red meat allergy from a tick bite. I had been getting sick every now and then for a couple months but never connected it. I told the male doctor what happened with the nurse and he made a somewhat snarky comment to her about how she shouldn‚Äôt jump to conclusions or get tunnel vision. 

I‚Äôve been fortunate with my doctors and gyno, they‚Äôre both the best rated doctors in my area and they‚Äôre both male but have NEVER made comments about if my boyfriend would approve. 

Side note: Is a male gyno weird? The reason I go to him is because every other doctor in town thought my grandmother was insane when she was having lady problems and dismissed it as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù menopause symptoms but she really had a tumor the size of a grapefruit. "
"That's wonderful! I've also got a best friend I've known since we were little kids, and it's been kinda cool to see how our relationship has changed and grown over the years as we've faced different stages of our lives. I hope you and your friend stay close for years to come :)"
"Never. I moisturize my face and neck daily, though."
"Idk, but I guess we are now  "
He‚Äôs a great writer!  Just so you know it‚Äôs a series and I accidentally read Streets of Laredo before Comanche Moon and I‚Äôm pissed about it...  &lt;3 Captain Call!
Thicker bristles.
"That‚Äôs not really a sexism thing though, that‚Äôs a liability thing. Unless you didn‚Äôt mention it, they weren‚Äôt insisting on a husband, they would have been just as happy to release you to a family member, friend, colleague or apparently a taxi driver - it‚Äôs just to make sure you‚Äôre getting home safely. I‚Äôve had the same thing after a medical procedure, they were quite happy for me to go once I told them I had rung a taxi, they just didn‚Äôt want me trying to drive myself or using public transport. "
"Almost too many to count... mostly medical. I had at the time undiagnosed endometriosis (now diagnosed and a huge list of medical since).

In HORRIFIC pain for years, I had to take my husband to the ob/gyn to get my first exploratory because they were busy trying to tell me ""periods hurt"" , no way did I bleed that much and wait another 6mo to see if it fixes itself. Fortunately for me, my husband at the time was beside himself with all these problems and wanted to help me.

 He LOST it on the doctor, and I had my first of many surgeries in two weeks... My 30minute exploritory took over 3 hours (my husband thought I died or something since they acted like it was all in my head/no big deal). My scar tissue was so bad that it had one Ovary tied up while wrapped around my colon etc etc.

Repeat every 6 months or so until a massive flip out from me and my husband to get my hysterectomy. To the point of ""what if another one of your children dies, you want to be able to have another"". Like my daughter who passed from SIDS,or my miscarriage could be easily replaced like a gold fish. And yes, they wanted HIS approval which even pissed him off... saying that I had every right to do a medical procedure to help me live my life."

"I never understood the ""real men don't eat quiche"" stereotype.

Quiche made with a nice flaky crust is awesome.  "
I disagree 5%. Her job is to provide the medical services requested however it‚Äôs not a stretch to give advise or ask questions related to those services. Now if her dentist asked that be different 
Thanks! I‚Äôm short so even knee high socks go above my knee :) 
Oh wow I've been there. People need to educate themselves or shut up.
"Oh my goodness I'm frustrated just reading this. 

I actually went car shopping with my mom and we went to the woman working there for my car. I'm stereotypically not well versed in car, so I'm glad I didn't get any of that bs you did. I probably would have lost it. "
"What the actual fuck. 


Hey Doc I've come for a checkup- oh no that's fine just talk to the man about coercing me into reproduction, I'll sit right here /s


I hope that guy got fired before she tried it on someone more vulnerable."
i have an image in my head of Goldmember with his weird skin box
I'm very glad you said something- that guy is a dickhead.
"The irritability and emotional lability lasted about the first 2 months for me, but I was going through some stress at the time as well. Breast tenderness resolved by month 3. 

I also felt more emotional the first month off the pill, but it‚Äôs leveled off since then. "
"There are so many things but the most important to me is that we show up for each other. Literally (parties, crises, generally hanging out) and figuratively in our day-to-day lives (with text messages, calls, hitting that like button). They saw me through a really difficult year with so much generosity and without me even asking (I was in such a state I couldn't). One friend got on a 6 hour train with her 2 month old (leaving her 2 year old with his dad) to spend the weekend basically mopping up my tears. Another insisted I move into her place for as long as I needed, no questions asked.

I would do anything for these women and tell them I love them at every opportunity. They're made made out of steel and kindness, I couldn't feel more lucky."
"Also, there is a [word](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=husbando) for ['male waifu'](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/husbando).

"I didn't do anything for my 16th, that I remember. For my 21st I went for a meal with people from work."
"Ugh this happened to me too. I was getting pizza with my boyfriend and I was paying and the guy at the counter kept talking to him only about the order and if we wanted to add anything. Then told my boyfriend the total, i handed the cashier my card, he swiped MY CARD and handed it back to my boyfriend. Then handed my boyfriend a receipt, which my bf handed to me, then handed my boyfriend another receipt and pen that I had to sign since I was the one paying. So frustrating, and my boyfriend though it was weird as fuck too"
"That makes me realize how lucky I am to have my husband. When I told him she asked me that, he said, ‚Äúwhy would you need my permission? I‚Äôm so happy for you. I know how much this job means to you.‚Äù Then he took me out to celebrate. It was great! "
That is ridiculous 
And then they get lots of dogs!! 
"I'm a PhD student and had a well-paid summer internship last summer doing the job I want to do when I graduate at one of the companies I want to work for. When I found out that I got the internship and shared the news with my PhD advisor (an older man), he asked me if I had my husband's permission to spend a summer away from him in a different city. 

I gave him a sarcastic answer because I thought he was joking, but I very quickly realized that he wasn't and ended up having to have an awkward conversation about how my husband understands that this is a big opportunity, and can survive being lonely for three months so I can get a better job in the future. I wouldn't have spent 2 years applying to internships in other states if my husband and I hadn't already talked about it as equals.
"
"I feel incredibly guilty about not tipping but I went to the counter quietly after we finished and said that he really can't say shit like that - if I'd been more insecure about my size then it would've probably ruined our meal completely. And I was paying, so there was literally zero reason to ask my boyfriend's permission about anything related to our order. Feel sorry for his girlfriend if he has one."
"The only days I ever didn't poop are right after surgery, because anesthesia makes me constipated. But yeah seriously, same!"
"When I bought my car the salesman kept addressing my ex, who had just come along to keep me company. He had never had a driving lesson in his life, had no interest in driving and knew nothing about cars. He also tried to sell me 2 cars with defects before I firmly insisted on the one I have now. "
I had one right in the middle of my cheek removed in the summer. My partner was SO relieved that it was gone even though like yours it was slow growing. He now says I looked like I have a white star on my face and that the scar is awesome!!!
"I hope you reported this nurse, I‚Äôve never heard of anyone putting the ownus on the man to decide your contraception choices, wtf?!"
"I‚Äôve been going to gyms for 20 years. Regular gym goers won‚Äôt pay you any mind unless you hog a machine or act like an asshole. Newbies are the only ones I‚Äôve ever seen act inappropriate- and even that is rare but Monday night I saw a chubby newbie (20 years- never saw her before) taking pics of ppl without their consent and giggling and sending them somewhere. I was flabbergasted by that- have never seen that before! So, don‚Äôt be that gal and you‚Äôll be fine"
"Back in college I was seeing a guy and I previously had pretty long hair but decided to cut it back. I love changing it up every once in awhile and sometimes that means chopping off all my hair. Upon seeing my new haircut (which I loved), he said ""I liked you with longer hair"". It didn't last much longer because of it. 

Last year I cut my hair short again and my now SO said he loved it as soon as I walked in the door.

"This is the least of her awful behavior haha.

But thanks. :)

Things are better now - we've reached an understanding. We have some sort of relationship, but it isn't close. "
"This is a sales thing, not a sexism thing. If you sell someone a big, expensive item, the first thing the SO is going to hear when you tell them about it, isn‚Äôt all the bells and whistles, it‚Äôs the price tag.
In fact, that‚Äôs all they‚Äôll hear. They will put the kabosh on your big budget purchase every time.
So getting your SO on board to hear the sales pitch and get excited about spending tons of money is probably what sales guy is thinking here.

Your salesman was probably too pushy, and you shouldn‚Äôt buy if you‚Äôre not comfortable. But he wasn‚Äôt necessarily sexist."
"Not as bad as some of these on here, but shopping for a new car. Sorry it's a little long.

My mother was looking for a new car and asked me to come with her since my dad was busy. We went to a dealership about 40 miles away because they had a car she was interested in and a decent price online. She found the one she liked and decided to see what the dealership could do. If it was a good deal she would buy the car and drive it back home. The salesman gave her his little speech and then told her to ""come back when your husband's available and we'll see if we have a deal"". My mom was confused because 1. She didn't mention a husband and 2. Wtf does he have to do with this anyway? My parents have separate accounts and a joint bill pay account. They do what they want with their money as long as they put some in the bill account first. None of which is this dude's business. She lets the guy know this is her car with her money and only her name would be on the title. He then looks at ME and asks me if MY husband would be okay with me making a big purchase on my own without him there. I was 7 months pregnant at the time and not wearing my wedding ring so I just smiled and said I'm not married! He looked appalled and my mom stood up and told him we were done. Refused his business card and we left. She bought a similar car from somewhere else of course. There was some sexism there also but that's another story!"
"Because I dealt with several car salesman like that, I went to several dealerships and ended up running into a woman that sold cars. She was so awesome through the entire ordeal and made it simple for me. I got the car I wanted, at a rate I could afford and she didn‚Äôt hassle me into a new car like all the other salesmen did. I couldn‚Äôt even drive the car I wanted to drive at one dealership, he just kept bringing new cars that I couldn‚Äôt afford monthly. I had a good down payment to work with so I guess he figured he was going to convince me to get a new one. I didn‚Äôt. And I love the car I got. Good on you for taking your business elsewhere. "
"For what it's worth, my wife has tattoos and already has 2 when we met. Just to further emphasize the already obvious bullshit "
"Surprise surprise, men get asked those questions too, regarding vasectomies (or the reversal of such). And whats wrong with that: if youre married, such a decision has a major impact on both people's lives."
If that's the case they should say this.
"Yeah that‚Äôs my thing. I didn‚Äôt mind the first time he brought it up really but at that point I straight out said that this is my car, that I will be paying for, and my partner is not involved in this process. And he just couldn‚Äôt drop it. "
That's hilarious because in New York I can't imagine a retail worker wasting any of their breath on trying not to make the sale.  It's either apathy or cutthroat hard sell tactics here.
"I'm sure she had no idea about all of these reasons, thank you so much for explaining. /s"
"Been there, done that, hated it every time."

Educate me then. What do hetero that don't enjoy hetero sex do? Do they stick to only oral stimulation and vibrators? For what reason do they dislike penetration?
"I was looking into donating my eggs years ago. The clinic wouldn‚Äôt even see me without my partner present, not even for a general information session. It was also  a requirement that he signed a form giving his consent for me to proceed with any discussions, and I was given zero autonomy. 

The same clinic, however, accepted semen samples from any male at any time with no partner involvement whatsoever. And the icing on the cake, they paid men for their samples while women weren‚Äôt allowed to ‚Äúprofit from their eggs‚Äù.

It rarely happens. People must just go to the bathroom when they have to fart. I know I do. Stinking up the office would suck. 
By totally fine do you mean them personally not caring about being moisturized?
"I've only ever used this as an excuse. Once or twice when people came to my door selling things, I told them I had to consult my husband first. I wasn't married at the time.

Only tangentially related, but now that I am in fact married, everyone calls me about my husband's stuff. Tax stuff for both me and my husband? They'll call me, not him. Buying a flat together, and he is doing all the communication with the seller (as I'm super busy at the moment)? She'll call me anyway. Even his mum calls me and not him when she wants info about something, but to be fair, she knows from experience that I'm more likely to have the answer for her. Where I live, it's just commonly accepted that men are clueless and that women are running the show outside the professional sphere. (And sadly, most of the time men are happy to assume this role as well, but this is super off topic.)"
"This bothers me so much, I‚Äôm only 22 but have a fairly prominent scar on my chest and ones going down the center of my ribs from heart surgery. I‚Äôve had exes friends ask if they‚Äôre ok with my scars and heart condition. Uummm yes, if they weren‚Äôt we wouldn‚Äôt be dating. "
I agree. I recommend the documentary How to Die in Oregon which explores this topic. It is currently legal in 8 states in the US.
I don't whisper - I just tell em... ask her she knows her shit. 
Please consider reporting her.
Da fuq? That's some serious controlling behavior right there. Can't imagine what kind of stuff he pulls when other people aren't around. 
Imbecile didn‚Äôt realize you were the decision maker...sales people are trained to feel this out but after your first time saying it‚Äôs your money I would‚Äôve known to stop mentioning your SO...
"Ugh, this. I have 2 gyno issues and it's not unheard of to have a hysterectomy for one of them. So many docs concerned about my future boyfriend's wanting kids.. like really.. idgaf if they want kids, my uterus is trying to kill me. I have sooooo many reasons for not wanting kids and apparently it's not my choice?

Too many people concerned with imaginary mens made up opinions."
"As a hairstylist, I experience the opposite. A woman will say she‚Äôs interested in trying short hair but then go back and say their husband won‚Äôt like it, let‚Äôs just do half an inch. I always tell them it‚Äôs their hair, their body, their choice. "
"Next time you get one like that, gesture him to come in close and whisper exactly that in his ear, ""Dude, you are fucking up not including her,"" and see what happens, lol."

"Car dealerships can be the most misogynistic places sometimes. 

I went care shopping once at one of those large lots where they have flyers for every car. The salesperson helping me brought a big stack over to his desk of all the cars that met my qualifications (I had a short list of manufacturers/colors, I think), but before he handed over the pile, he informed me ‚Äúoh I forgot to remove all the stick shifts.‚Äù 

I let his ass sit there and go through the whole stack.

Once he was done and handed me all the lady-safe auto transmission cars, I was like, ‚Äúk, can I see that other pile too?,‚Äù and stacked them back together before I browsed. "

"It's fine. If I waited to get 100% over them, I wouldn't date for decades. Sure, I'm over my college boyfriend, but I'm only 98% over my ex-husband and we split up in 2011. So yeah, no, it's ok to not wait, just as it's ok to wait."
I hope he didn't get a tip. What an asshole!
"When buying a fucking washing machine. The guy came to my house to measure the space, quoted me a price and then told me to call him after I'd talked to my husband and he agreed.

"I went out with my ex to an ice cream/dessert parlour. I'm a pretty small size, gym regularly, etc etc, and I was starving and wanted a damn waffle. Ordered the most ridiculous thing I could find on the menu. Server looked at my ex and went ""are you okay with her ordering that?"" D U D E"

I don't think I ever has illusions about how smart I was. I was actually really surprised when I did well in school. I had always thought I was the dumbest one of my class.
"        I went in to get my hair cut from long to chin length. The lady cutting my hair kept telling me how pretty my hair was and I shouldn't cut it. Then as she was cutting it she asked me if I was married and then starting saying how my husband wouldn't like it and how she couldn't believe he was letting me cut my hair. After I told her my husband likes shorter hair/doesn't actully care what my hair looks like, she asked me if I had kids. After I said yes she asked me who was watching my kids and when I said my husband she looked shocked. 
          All of this on top of giving me a bad haircut. "
I read on here the other week about how this guy went off on one cause his wife got a promotion and would out earn him and he told her not to take it...
I never had any with my pills.  
"yeah this did come to mind.

But I'd like the version in which the guy also isn't big on kids and that's why he helps her out and then they fall in love and he is super fine with her being more successfull in her career and... oh yes"

"This doesn't quite fit what you asked, but our tax system is *messed up*.

It doesn't matter if you file jointly or separately, or if you're married; if a woman gets a tax refund because she paid too much, and she cohabits with a spouse, *the refund cheque goes in the name of the her partner*. Even if he's unemployed, didn't pay any taxes, and all of that money is hers. Doesn't matter. It makes me so fucking angry. "
"My husband had to get my permission to get a vasectomy in 2006, and from what I've heard that's fairly common. I think it's BS that anyone of either sex needs anyone's permission to sterilize themselves."

"I think some people are just plain incompatible with receiving anal lol. Men and women both. There's a whole lot of nerve endings down there, and any sensation is going to be pretty overwhelming, often to the point of being downright painful, not to mention it can be pretty difficult to get over the fact that it... feels a LOT like pooping.

&amp;#x200B;

I can sometimes, rarely, get into it. For me it's a lot about doing something really special with my partner and putting a lot of thought and prep-work into it. Sometimes it doesn't really work and it's too painful and I have to stop haha, at which point we'll just go have a shower and maybe pick things up again a little while later."

I get a kick when sales guys are trying to talk to me and not her.  Dude you are fucking up not including her. "
"This didn‚Äôt happen to me, but happened to my sister and her wife when they moved from Tennessee to Maryland about 10 years ago.

They used a local Tennessee moving company to pack up and moved their stuff. When they got to Maryland, they found that a bunch of stuff had been pretty decently damaged, and that it was obvious their belongings hadn‚Äôt been packed right by the movers. So my sister called the company to complain and see if they could get a small amount knocked off their bill for the damages.

The owner refused to give her any sort of discount...and asked to speak to her husband. Because, as he said, ‚ÄúWomen are just not rational about money.‚Äù My sister responded, ‚ÄúExcuse me? I don‚Äôt have a husband; I have a wife, and if you‚Äôd like to speak to her that‚Äôs fine, but she‚Äôll say the same thing I‚Äôm saying.‚Äù The owner then asked her if she was a Christian, at which point my sister hung up, called the Better Business Bureau, and they compensated her and her wife for the damages."

The other day I was asking a large company about a quote on new windows and the female representative asked me when my husband would be home as well for them to come by and give us a quote. I told her that he is fine with me making the decision on renovations, so anytime I'm off work is okay and she legit refused to make an appointment with just me there. She said they will only come out if he is available at the same time. I was in disbelief and still am!"

I was married at the time when we first met. We worked together and developed instant chemistry. He ended up finishing college and moved away. Years later my marriage didnt work out and i was back on the singles scene and was dating this guy. One night i got a call and it was from the friend from the past. It was like fate was keeping him away from me. Just never the right time. But we kept in touch and stayed as friends. Broke up with the guy i was dating and the friend asked me out. Within 2 years later we got married.

The fact that these husband came back at the stylist to yell at her makes me afraid for their poor wives and how he probably behaved with them just for cutting their hair. :( 
"I‚Äôm allergic to it too!!! Everyone and their brother has recommended that product to me over the years during a very weird, insistent skin issue and it broke me out in hives! I had NEVER had a reaction to a lotion before, but it scared me!

I use the Working Hands product when my hands are at their worst. It is straight up manic in a jar! If you haven‚Äôt tried it, it‚Äôs worth a shot. 

I also recommend VaniCream! It can be found in a big white tub with blue lettering. It is used as a base in compounded skin creams in pharmacies because it is so gentle and it is CRAZY effective! I do feel the one drawback is that I have to work a bit harder to get it rubbed in all the way, but I never have to reapply once it‚Äôs on. 

Hope these are helpful!! Good luck fellow dry-skin sufferer!"

"My husband and I have a rule: if the purchase is over $500, we need to discuss it. Anything under is fair game, HOWEVER, since I‚Äôm the only one that routinely buys large dollar amount items, I will try to run it by him prior to making the purchase if it‚Äôs over $150. So, I was making a quilt for a friend, went to the store and spent $200. The cashier asked me if my husband is ok with me spending that kind of money.  Fabric is fucking expensive. I explained our rule and walked out. Too bad it was the only decent shop in the area for quilting fabric. "

"It's not a husband but my brother but it's the same concept. Went to buy a printer for my computer, my brother invited me with him because he knows I'm better at that stuff than he is. Went to the store and the guy didn't even talk to me, asked questions to my brother which *I* answered. 

The guy was genuinly unintrested to show us anything we asked him about, because it probably looked like we can't afford it or whatever.

Needless to say, we went somewhere else. "
"When I was being promoted from intern to full time at my current job, my boss asked me if ‚ÄúI was sure my husband was ok with this‚Äù.

"First off, genetics gave me very healthy, shiny, hair that adheres to societal beauty standards. I‚Äôm also lazy about hair and don‚Äôt really like dealing with it, but established the following:

* got a very flattering, unique haircut. This takes time. You need to find a hairdresser who can work with your hair, your wants, and what is reasonable for you to do. I have an asymmetrical long pixie, after a couple years of tweaking what it looked like.
* shower at night, air dry, style in the morning. This works because of my hair texture and current length. It may not for you. Reduced heat definitely helps my hair.
* styling takes me less than five minutes and most of that is waiting for my tools to heat up. Like I said, I‚Äôm lazy. I accept I need to style my hair a little to have the level of polish I‚Äôm looking for, but it cannot take me more than five minutes. I use a heated straightening brush to do most of my hair (get it to lie smoothly, get rid of any weird waves from drying and sleeping on it), and then I use a flat iron for the front part of my hair. 
* get it trimmed regularly. I got every 4-5 weeks because my hair is currently short, but even those with longer hair need a regular trim. I used to be guilty of getting my hair cut once a year and wondering why it looked not so great most of the time. Because I let my hair get ratty with split ends, etc. Now it looks great 99% of the time. "
Abortion. We 100% do not want children.

Hi Lyn 
"I stopped caring because I realised I had to do things at a different pace from other people. It‚Äôs hard to accept that a lot of people would finish college and find jobs earlier than me, but in the end it doesn‚Äôt really matter. You‚Äôll find people who are in similar situations sometimes ‚Äî they might‚Äôve taken a different pathway to get to the same point. Perfectionism is a bitch and not worth the toll it takes on your mental health

"I know, that's why I really want to to sell. They just haven't vested yet.

"For some reason I can‚Äôt remember my 16th or 21st, probably because they were uneventful (but I‚Äôm only 23 so, brain pls), but I vividly remember my 13th.

My Mom bought pizza from this fancy pants local pizza place (sourdough crust tho) and a beautiful cake with fondant on it and it was all so delicious but I was sick that night and I couldn‚Äôt stop throwing up for a few days. I had mononucleosis and had to be hospitalized and almost went into septic shock. "
Then my husband got a vasectomy (which is reversible and no one would ask him if he got his wife‚Äôs permission). And I don‚Äôt want children with a man who doesn‚Äôt want children. All kids deserve better than that. 
"&gt; many doctors refuse to preform them under a certain age

I wish it was easier. Tell the doc you don't want kids. And they'll bring up the whole "" you'll change your mind "" bs."
TIL
"&gt;I just got instructed to ""make sure your husband is ok with using a different contraception"" by the nurse who refused to remove my implant or discuss other, non hormonal options, unless I'd made sure my husband ""trusted me to take the pill on time or else have to use condoms""

I know it's not the doctor telling you that, but that is still *way* out of line. If they actually refused to remove your implant without your husband's consent, then you definitely have grounds for a lawsuit. That could very well be illegal, but then again I'm not a lawyer.  "
He always assumes I‚Äôm wrong even though I‚Äôm usually right at least half of the time. In the beginning I‚Äôd get mad and take it as an insult to my ego but now when I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm right I just do a little google-ing and if I‚Äôm right I shove the screen in his face and make him admit he was wrong or I give him a coy little my bad. 
which in the winter (when lotion is needed the most) is a huge problem
"Okay this is going to sound really strange and probably unhelpful, but...

overtime, I've taken social cues from reality TV. I watch a lot of Bachelor, Bachelor in Paradise, Love Island, etc.,

When you see other people interact with a man, you really get to see whose game works and whose doesn't. Typically, revealing too much of your facial expressions, body language, overall excitement that they're around you can be a turn off. It can be a turn off to tell a guy just how into them you are, it can be a turn off to act shy, intimidated, nervous, and anxious. However, when you're the kind of girl that's too confident, that's a turn off too. 

Then when you get in the real world and try to apply your knowledge, it's hard. It's hard to suppress feelings of anxiety and intimidation when you're around someone you like or you find attractive.

Alcohol helps me, tbh.  "

"Now you're claiming I want to feel feel assaulted. Okay.
I genuinely think you have severe mental issues.
You flat out deny my right of wishing to choose something else for MY life because your opinion is more important for MY life. It's absolutely incredible. And in the very next sentence you turn it around 180 and say my opinion does not count the exact same way yours does.

You seriously have a mental issue.
I can only tell you for the 3rd or 4th time that I recognize your choice and opinion, and that my choice is different and no matter how much you assault me verbally and deny me my right to my opinion and put words in my mouth and claim that I want to experience rape and what not, I will not back down from saying that I would rather deal with all these things than living the solitary life that I live.

You seem extremely egotistical and I almost wonder if it's a result of your being desired so much, that you believe you and your opinion are the only thing that matters and anyone else who dares to disagree will get anihilated by your fury. Heck, I don't even disagree, that's the stunning part here. I have several times now accepted your choice and said only the if it was my choice for myself I would choose differently, for MYSELF. But that is unacceptable for you and you aggressively attack me for it for several comments. Do  you even realize how insane that is?

And you make fun of me and call ME sad? 
You've got to wonder what's more sad. Someone relentlessly attacking an internet stranger for stating a choice for THEIR OWN LIFE or someone wishing they were desired.

"Your friend was probably blaming things on you to her parents that other girls were doing, maybe?"
"Yeahhh the average woman doesn't look like the women you see in movies, media or even instagram as you mentioned in another comment. Those are either very beautiful women, or photoshopped women. Or tbh both, already beautiful and *still* photoshopped.

Of course women are gonna be hit on constantly if they're beautiful or if it's a pic on instagram photoshopped to perfection. But most of us do not look like that.

We're as invisible as you. The only reason fewer women openly bitch about it is because we're brought up being told our looks matter most, and what to expect (or not) if we're not pretty enough. So it's no surprise when we don't get interest, and that it's reserved for beautiful/hot women. We already knew thats how the world works.

Guys always seem kind of surprised that their looks matter for relationships, and get angry about this shocking fact, because they're not brought up being told that their looks matter so much that way from young childhood. 

We're in a weird transitional stage in regards to how our societies work, where guys still think they're entitled to women, but women actually have free choice of who to date and sleep with now and arn't being forced by their parents into marriages lol.

That's an interesting response. So nobody has ever hit on you?
"I don't really use lotion, maybe every once in a while on my hands if someone is offering it because they're doing their own hands."
I was the victim of a very violent home invasion by a complete stranger. 
"Met in an online game on opposite coasts, met up, and the rest is history. That was 10 years ago. :)"
"When I was in my teens, my periods used to last between 5-7 days and were usually accompanied by severe cramps. I'd often miss school once a month so I could stay home with my besties, Chocolate and Hot Water Bottle. 

Rather miraculously, my 20s have brought on milder, shorter periods. Now they only go for 4 days (5 is rare) and there's minimal cramping, just a little bit on my first day. After years of suffering through terrible cramps, I'm glad I don't have to deal with them any more! "
"There is a Nivea product called ""in shower lotion"" I know its available in the USA. I apply it while in the shower, rinse off a little of it so I don't feel slimy and then get out and dry off as usual. It absorbs quick and doesn't leave you feeling icky all day. It might leave some residue on your towels though. "
What did you do to set it up?
Same here man
tshirts!  women's tshirts are way too low cut and the top of my bra cups hangs out. I much prefer the neckline of men's tshirts
Women's razors are different to men's though. Women's razors are less sharp than men's. 
What about shimmer lights did you hate?  The smell?  Something else?
"Yeah! That really drew me in, as well as the world building - it was so rich and deep from the first page. 

I definitely related a bit more to Lirael, but to be fair, she has a lot more ""screen-time""."
"When I was 14-17 my periods varied so much! Some cycles were heavy and I needed a stick-on heating pad for 4 days and then like 4 more of light pain and bleeding. Then the next would be perfectly manageable.
I went on hormonal BC and didn't really have periods for 5 years, I wouldn't even bleed on my week break.

I've had the copper IUS fitted for 3 weeks now and I'm waiting for my first proper period. I think it's coming either today or tomorrow but I'm so out of sync with my uterus I literally have NO clue what's going to happen!!"
"If you ain't trying to go pro it hardly matters who you play :) Pharah is also my favorite and I barely play anyone else. I'm glad someone said her in here, I don't see all that many Pharah mains in my games."
"DDD isn‚Äôt generally big enough to cause back pain, depending on you frame. It‚Äôs a size that‚Äôs enough to have trouble fitting into button-down shirts, but it doesn‚Äôt look disproportionate or cause any other issues. "
That's disappointing to hear. It's a bummer when rumors turn out to be true. I would of hoped she would of learned something during her time in prison :/

Respect 
I couldn‚Äôt care less about it.
"Shea Moisture. I recommend their whole kit of facecare products. It's only $20 on Amazon and it comes with the soap, moisturizer, face scrub, and clay mask. All that lasts me 2-3 months"

"I loved *White Oleander.* Janet Fitch's prose is incredible. I remember Oprah reviewing the book and calling it ""liquid poetry."" I thought it was a pretty apt description. "
"~~could care less~~ 

Couldn't care less"
I've gotten a lot of compliments from other women on the natural color of my hair. 
"What kind of gym is it that no one does anything about that?  You'd think the owners would be invested in making the environment welcoming, if only for the money."
Wow what a nut job
Every girl is different. There are some girls who are touchy by nature no matter your relation to her and others who can‚Äôt stand it even if they like you. 
"I‚Äôd be very happy and nervous at the same time. Tell my bf, and straight up tell him I want to keep it. I know he‚Äôs not ready, he already has a daughter. "
"Graceling, Fire, and Bitterblue by Kristin Cashore. It's a trilogy with common characters and themes throughout. Each book has a unique form of heroine. One has been bred to kill but has a large heart. One has been treated with distain for Al of her life due to her parents and has to rise above this criticism. One has a lot of power on her shoulders and a mind for puzzles and math and logic.

They are beautiful novels and I think if you want a well written, well rounded female protagonist, you should look no further.

I would also put up Tamora Pierce's female protagonists but there are some racial problems in her earlier books. They get better; she learns and grows. But there would be no Cashore without Pierce and it is worth going through those novels.

Also, honestly? The Last Unicorn and the Unicorn Sonata by Peter S Beagle. I don't know why Beagle's female characters (truly all of his characters) are so human and vulnerable and well written. Also I know I'm giving you a lot of fantasy novels. However the Last Unicorn is one of the best books I have ever read and I have read a lot. His depression while writing it has birthed a fantasy universe of wonderful characters. Unicorn Sonata is one of his lesser known, more recent novels and it is a beautiful journey from start to finish.

"Eat messy foods and use the washroom. The one I don‚Äôt understand the most now is the eating foods one, that was so weird of me lol. "
"I like both Paula Hawkins novels - The Girl On The Train and Into The Water much more than I liked Flynn‚Äôs. 

I‚Äôd also recommend Behind Her Eyes (Sarah Pinborogh), Sometimes I Lie (Alice Feeney)


You‚Äôve mentioned mystery novels in your description but if you‚Äôre open to other genres: The Devil Wears Prada, Dangerous Girls (it‚Äôs YA but really good), Bad Blood (biographical - excellent)"
"
All this time I never realised that I was protagonist in a bad rom-com... "
"Mistborn, if you're into fantasy."
I have zero regrets about buying mine. I‚Äôm in the process of going back to blonde and I didn‚Äôt want to exacerbate the damage with my straightener and curling rod so I thought it would be a good substitute. I actually prefer it to those tools now. It‚Äôs like the best blow out I‚Äôve ever had. 
"See that's the problem with you dragons, me and my friends walk up to you in your swamp just trying to have a chat, you roar back something i have no hope of understanding and it inevitably ends in a fight.

And of course to add insult to injury, because of the crappy loot system, all i get as consolation for having to fight for my life, is a mediocre-at-best dagger and some crafting mats.

"i sneakily pried my buttcheeks open to fart silently because i was horrified of my SO hearing me fart when we went to sleep... for like beyond the first year. it worked tho.

he laughed his head off when i told him and asked me how i did it"
"Hey im very glad to hear you're doing better, it gives me hope. Similar story, except dad would tell me that when I was 5. It was a toxic family and he's long long gone. Except my mother had a really rough childhood even though she did so much for her family, her mother abused the fuck out of her.

She transferred those onto us in her tough times and it did a number on my sibling and I. I've definitely closed myself off from people and very much resonate with your problems. Getting female attention from hot girls wasn't in my books either earlier.

What books did you find helpful? Have you read ""can't hurt me - David goggins""? First chapter is similar to our story and it's sort of comforting knowing that a person can come out stronger and stronger from hell. "
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **1st Cakeday** uglyschmuckling! ^(hug)
"I‚Äôd say the past year has been the best so far in our 4-year relationship; my anxiety is better than it‚Äôs ever been, and he‚Äôs not depressed anymore. We‚Äôre really, ridiculously happy, even though we live 3 hours away and can only see each other on weekends. 

The lowest point was when he broke up with me for about a month after I graduated college. That was about 2 years ago, and it was very hard. He was feeling depressed and I didn‚Äôt have a good grip on my anxiety at all; I also was moving back home, and he lived very close to the Uni we went to, so the distance put stress on us as well. When he broke up with me, I was miserable and in so much pain, but when he asked me back a month later, I told him I needed time to reconsider before getting back with him. We started dating again, and he was very eager to make things up to me and show he had changed. He truly had, so we got back together and have been very happy since (almost 2 years later). I think, in a weird way, taking that break helped both of us. I really had to focus on myself an get my anxiety under control, and my boyfriend needed to acknowledge his depression and the fact that he was emotionally distant with me. He realized this on his own and told me he felt he took my love for granted, and ever since, he‚Äôs been an amazing and emotionally open partner. He went through some pretty awful trauma as a kid (his dad cheated on his mom and then committed suicide; his mom had an aneurism shortly after, and he had to take care of his sister with special needs while his mom recovered), and this made him have a hard time being open with people. "
"On the first three types of pills I was on, I felt it probably a month in. Then on depo, I didn‚Äôt have any emotional side effects, now I‚Äôm on another type of pill and no emotional side effects either"
Same. I've been told many times by shorter women that they are jealous of my height and wish they were taller. 
The closest I ever got to a financial planning class was a math teacher who frequently used tax information and budgeting to get us to apply what she was teaching. 
Arrogance 
Thank you.
"I am very jealous of this, lol. I look like an alien without extensions and mine aren't even that short, just nowhere near extensions"
Yup. He was one of my favourites as well!
Rolf that is awesome you and you deserve a medal for that
"16: Had just arrived in the US 2 days earlier, was super jet lagged but ate at Golden Corral's with my host family (was an exchange student) for the first time. Came home to a big cake."
"Sexual aggression, or any type of aggression really. A person could be all sorts of fine, but if they started pushing for more physical contact when I was already apprehensive or had already asked for it to go slower then that would make me see them in an entirely different light."

Do what now?
I don't get that as a side effect. It actually helps with my moods. 
"Uhhh, never? Or should I say I've never thought of myself as being particularly smart or enlightened. I have never had any confidence. I try to give myself some credit and tell myself I'm not dumb but it always feels fake and forced. "
"My first bf cheated on me with multiple girls and also with **the girlfriend of his best friend.** It ended as it should, I broke up with him the minute I knew, he lost his best friend and after a while most of his friends because they realized how shitty of a person he was. This took place around 2015, by now he lost his ""sixpack"", got a bit chubby, he also dropped out of school and lost 3 (I think) jobs due to being a shitty human being. Karma really did it's job."

i feel like 110% more justified in wanting a phone call before meeting, now. like can you imagine being on a coffee date and praying to god no one hears him? omg"
"What an incredibly good gotcha! Good job! Except I said from the beginning that I did not give a single shit. WE COVERED THIS DAYS AGO. 

Now, when I get a comment reply, I reread the chain that lead up to it so I don't feel like a total ass by repeating myself or by misremembering what was said. I guess I just don't like wasting everyone's time. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
