"Really look at their own behavior. My mom was my first and worst bully from age 10-13. I felt powerless, dumb, and defeated at home so when I got to school that’s how I made others feel. I remember she would come in for parent teacher conference and would act appalled by my behavior but I was literally mirroring what she would say and do to me. 

I think if my mom would’ve treated me with respect then I wouldn’t have been so horrible to my peers at the time."
"Met a perfect man, love story out of a movie: coffee in bed, can’t stop talking, can’t leave each other, a perfect match in everything, he could read my mind and knew my every feeling and emotion and what to say and when and how, from food to sex, literature and movies to politics. Unfortunately, geography and being from different countries and nationalities and restrictions coming with distance didn’t let it grow. He had to leave. And he did."
"Ripe raspberries, they taste like candy to me"
"I’m a big believer in the idea that you’ll find love when you least expect it. My heart was absolutely CRUSHED by my last ex boyfriend. I cried for months and thought that I would never find anyone. I dated people from tinder but never felt a connection or spark. After a particularly disappointing fling, I decided that I was done with dating other people and that I was going to date myself. I signed up for a pottery and sewing class on a Sunday morning and then that night went to a movie with my best friend. When we got out of the movie, we decided to get a quick drink at a bar on the way to the train station. I went into the bar and made eye contact with a guy there. It was love at first sight. But I refused to approach him because, hey, I was dating myself! He ended up coming up to me and we chatted. We went on a date the following week and have now been together for four years."
"You've got to realize a couple of things and take them to heart. 

1.  They don't want to be with you.
2.  You don't want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with you.
3.  Forgive them for not being the person you wanted them to be."
"I met my husband at a stoplight. I didn’t normally pick up guys at stoplights lol we just caught each other’s attention and now we’ve been together for almost 14 years, married for almost 7, and have 3 children and 2 dogs."
"I realised after the relationship ended. I was googling ""signs of emotional abuse"" and while many applied to my ex-partner, just as many applied to my own behaviour in that relationship."
"I went to an anime convention with a friend. I had no interest, just went along.

This incredibly awkward guy in a full body pikachu suit stared at my boobs for a good 5 minutes before saying ""my mom made this costume for me. Want to see what's underneath?"""
"Having a child die of cancer.  I knew that this was a thing that happened to families, I just never in a million years even considered that it would be us."
"My uncle trying to kiss me, and then saying ""look at you, how could any guy resist"". UH I WOULD THINK ONE WHO CHANGED MY DIAPERS COULD."
"As with everything of this nature it’s all about the context. 

If he did it at the wrong time naturally I wouldn’t like it or appreciate it.  For example if he did it in public and made some big show out of it that wouldn’t go down well. 

Other times it’s good. It’s fun."
"I just had a plate of sliced peaches and strawberries. So good. Same with making ""ice cream"" with frozen bananas in the blender. I add chocolate protein powder and hempseeds, but it tastes similiar to a Wendy's frosty."
"Whenever our dogs leave balls, or toys they’ve chewed on that have rough textures, in the middle of the room or hallway at night I move them over so nobody steps on them in the dark."
"I answered my front door while 6 months pregnant with my first child. It was someone serving my husband papers for a paternity suit, regarding the twins he failed to mention he had."
"When my boyfriend isn’t home and I’m using his xbox, sometimes he gets invites from his friends. I always message them to say that he isn’t home so his friends don’t think he’s ignoring them. 

I also cook a larger quantity of food than usual when I’m about to leave for a trip, and he’ll be home alone. So there’s enough leftovers to eat until I get back."
Not wanting to fuck them.
"Had a boyfriend tell me that he would NEVER date a girl that had been sexually assaulted because they're too ""messed up"". That one guy's words made me terrified for YEARS to tell anyone about what had happened to me when I was 15."
"Not to ignore the red flags. I had multiple red flags with my ex where he made it so blatantly obvious he would choose anything else above me (his guy friends, shadily texting an ex when I had told him it made me uncomfortable etc) but I chose to believe whatever excuses he’d give me because I loved him so much &amp; love conquers all right? Nah, when someone shows you who they are, believe them. The right person won’t put any of those thoughts in my mind."
"Na, too busy lying around in fetal position and trying not to puke."
Being in an emotionally abusive relationship. I always thought I was too strong and too smart for that. Turns out it's not that simple.
"I have a black flag tattoo and a minor threat tattoo and when I was younger guys would stop me at shows and tell me to “name the lead singer in 82’” “name five songs” etc.  I never really participated in these kinds of conversations and would just walk away which of course lead to shouts of “it’s because you can’t!”. Okay, yeah, you’re right. I went and got a permanent tattoo to impress the guy in a small town hardcore band who works as a cashier at CVS. Not because I have my own likes and interests,"
"I was in a 9-year relationship with a man who had two boys (I have one daughter).  We lived together, planned to be married, etc.  He found his high school sweetheart on Myspace, back when Myspace was still a thing, and our relationship it fell apart.  I really loved him and I loved the boys like they were my own.  I was almost 40, and my kid was in high school.  I figured I was going to be one of those aging perennially single women so I stopped giving a shit about dating and started collecting rescue animals (4 at one point).  That was in 2009.

In 2013 a new bartender started working at my neighborhood Mexican restaurant.  We started talking, then we started flirting.  Then one day he casually walked by my table and dropped his phone number in my lap. Long story short, we're getting married next year.  :)"
"1. see someone attractive at stop light 
2. ???
3. be married"
"A very well known professor got me drunk at his welcome party and when he offered to drive me home, he tried to lock me in his car after he made it clear he was looking to have sex with me. 

It was surreal. It still is surreal. I can google his name right now and get glowing reports from his colleagues across the world and he's still the same guy that screamed at me that he didn't care if I was sick and reached across me and slammed the door lock down when I tried to get out."
Finding someone to spend the rest of my life with.
"I found out 25 years too late that the man I was mad about also liked me. He only told me recently and it's been hard to come to terms with how different my life would have been had either of us said something as simple as, ""I like you."""
Roasted cauliflower chopped and tossed with garlic and goat cheese. I inhale it.
"Met my recent ex. We are great together. Everything is perfect. Great conversation, respectful, passionate, deep. It’s wonderful. 

It’s just we are both so mentally unwell. I am so unstable at the moment and extremely suicidal. He is also very depressed and unable to function. 

We decided to end things to focus on ourselves and get better. It wasn’t mutual but I realised after how unwell I am and how we would have just destroyed each other. 

We are perfect for each other, just not right now."
"""You're wearing too much make up"" or ""you'd look better with less make up/more natural look"""
"Severus Snape. At the last book we can see great part of his past, including the classic ""Always"". Because of this, some people seem to forget that he was an actual bully. His past does not justify his maliciousness."
"Love it. My libido is even higher when I’m on my period so I’m happy my SO likes it too. We just lay a towel down first.

Funny story, the first time we did it, I bled on his sheets. I wasn’t embarrassed bc we discussed it before and he knew the risks but I did feel bad because he had really nice sheets that he loved. I did the old cold water rinse and he was AMAZED bc he thought blood stained. I rinsed them for him and put them in the washer and they care out like new...he thought I was Wonder Woman."
"I was married to my first husband for 10 years and we had a daughter together. I wasn’t happy for over half the marriage and after 10 years, he left for another woman. I wasn’t particularly hurt by it, it was kind of more of a relief. I could stop trying to be what he wanted me to be and start being myself.  I swore I would never get remarried again because I was intent on no man ever telling me what to do again or struggling to be accepted for who I was. When I met my current husband, I told him that I had no interest in ever getting married. Over time, he showed me what a different, healthy relationship could be like and we ended up getting married. We’ve been together for over 11 years now. He’s my best friend and it still amazes me that marriage can actually be a positive thing."
"I was wearing a Pink Floyd shirt with the *Animals* album cover.



Dude I didn't even know kicked my foot and dared me to name three songs from that album.



I didn't have a chance to say anything before my friend asked him the same question. He couldn't answer."
"When I married my (now late) husband 30 years ago, I was up to my a$$ in credit card debt, NO savings, NO IRA-- just a financial mess. Oh yeah, I was 40, so I should have had that stuff in place, right? He was NOT wealthy by any means, but he did have more $$ than I did. He was 50. He totally bailed me out financially. He died after only 10 years of marriage, but in the almost-20 years since he passed, I've been completely responsible, have given to charity, and have helped out friends who were where I was back then. God bless that lovely man. ^(I'll see you again some day, honey.)"
"My first concert was when my parents took me to see Motley Crue when I was like 12/13. We had funky shirt Friday at my old job in a grocery store and I made the mistake of wearing the shirt I got from that tour and every man over 40 that saw me said things like “you’re too young to know them” or “do you even know who that is on your shirt?” This also happens when I wear old concert shirts of my moms that I got when she passed. I don’t know why people think a 23 year old woman can’t possible know who Black Sabbath or REO Speedwagon is. They aren’t even old bands to me, just what I grew up listening to."
To stop putting myself last in the hope that someone else will put me first.
"No regrets, not even once. I'm 56. Two of my siblings had children. One brother did not. I was tempted at one point, long ago, after the birth of one of my nephews. Spending time taking care of him led me to imagine a life oriented around taking care of a child. I know I would have been a good parent. And yet my main reason for even thinking about it was so that I would have a ""clear purpose."" At the time, I was struggling to figure out what I wanted to do with my life, my career, my relationship. If I had a child, taking care of the child would have become the answer to all areas of doubt. Or at least, a commitment I would prioritize and fulfill at the expense of deciding what to do about my purpose, my career, my relationship. In any case, that was not a good enough reason to become a parent, at least by my reckoning. Now, decades later, I've had to wrestle with answering those questions, figure out how to become the best version of myself, know myself, respect myself, for my own sake. I love my nieces and nephews. And I love the life I have on my own."
"For 15 years, Daniel refused to keep a job, help with the housekeeping, help with the cooking, or discipline the kids. For 15 years, Miranda begged him to help more and he didn't. So she divorces him. 

THEN he decides to learn how to cook, get a job, discipline the kids AND cook!!! If he would have lifted a finger in the last 15 years to do any one of those things, he wouldn't be divorced! 

And people have the gall to say Miranda is the problem."
"Peanut butter on a banana.  I slice the banana in half, then long ways, so I get 4 pieces.  Spread a small amount of peanut butter on each slice.  Better than cake, to me.  And fills me up, doesn't hurt my stomach, salty and sweet, and good nutrients."
OK something positive: having a cat. I’ve been a lifetime dog person who was afraid of cats. I live in Istanbul where there are cats everywhere and I have touched maybe three cats in my life until my cat adopted me about two years ago.
"Almost all of the emotional labour for the family. Birthdays, school events, play dates, all that jazz. My husband thinks this shit magically happens!"
"I didn’t realize my own toxic behavior until after the relationship ended. My next relationship was sort of an immediate rebound and it didn’t go well. I realized that new people weren’t going to forgive my temper tantrums and flirting with other people as easily as my ex had...so that was kind of a wake up call. Also dating new people are trying to find someone who could fill my ex’s shoes turned out to be really hard, and from that I kind of learned to appreciate all the things he had done for me and the fact that I had learned so much from him.

Also I saw how sad certain friends/family members were to see my ex go. I already knew he was a good person but one friend in particular really called me out on my reasons for leaving him, some of which were shallow. I had legitimate reasons but I was also comparing my relationship a lot to other people’s and wanted to be with someone “better.” She was not really willing to be there for me emotionally when my rebound ended and made that clear she thought that me leaving was shallow. Another friend of mine pointed out pretty bluntly that I had begun smoking weed too much (bc basically I was running away from personal problems) and also that my ex was totally reasonable to be insecure after I had flirted with other people. 

There were other problems of course, but basically me never having been totally committed and kind of always window shopping combined with a bit of a temper that rather than fixing, I used weed to calm down was really unfair to put someone (especially a really sweet guy) through. I have redeeming qualities I swear!!!! 

TLDR; I realized after I left and couldn’t find someone to fill my ex’s shoes/couldn’t make relationships work bc my ex had been doing a lot of the emotional labor. Also my amazing friends were honest with me and some made it clear that they were losing respect for me after leaving a guy that was actually super nice..."
"My mom confused power/value with looking good and having money. So if I did something shitty to someone else, I would think ""oh well, at least I'm pretty. People will forgive me because I'm cute.""

How awful is that? And the money thing was more like...I don't really know how to explain it. Almost like I can use people if its advancing myself? Comments like ""marry rich, who cares about anything else."" that sort of thing. I remember in school telling my mom that people were making fun of me, and she would offer me comebacks like ""tell them 'at least my family has class.'"" Like it was all about socioeconomic status, which I now realize is SUCH a low blow.

So I'd say even if you're raising your daughter to believe in her own power, remind her that a person's value is so much more than money or physical appearance. She shouldn't judge herself by those standards, nor should she judge anyone else by those standards."

"Honestly I don't know if I'd consider myself a true ""mean girl"" in the sense that I never bullied anyone or really made any enemies. However, my friends and I did gossip a LOT. We were close and what we said never left our circle or got out, but it was still catty and awful. I think I wouldn't have been so comfortable with gossip if I didn't have a mom who gossiped too. Talking about others was a way for my mom and I to connect, and I saw a lot of it amongst her and her sisters and other female friends"
"“You’re really pretty for a brown girl.”

?????? In what world would saying something like that result in a good response"
That you’re actually fine on your own. When you’re codependent it’s very hard to see yourself being ok without that person. It’s the best feeling to know you are actually fine without them!
Carrie from Sex and the City is an awful human being.
"I think a lot of people realize this after their first LTR, especially if it occurs when they are a teenager/young adult."
"The first rule is always having your own life outside of your relationship and having a support system other than your SO. When your happiness source is only or heavily your relationship, seeing it end is like seeing your happiness end. The end of a relationship is a good time to work on yourself. Like, check what you did wrong in the relationship. Why do you wait or hope someone who left to *come back* and what does that say about you?

Also it's totally fine and natural to be upset for a while. Even a relationship that ends with both sides wanting it can be still sad over the disappointment that things didn't work out."
"I won't on the first day because it's too heavy, but we have a black towel for this purpose. Throw it down, good to go."
"Got pulled over by a hot cop. I tried to flirt my way out of it but he wasn't impressed. He gave me a ticket for a rolling stop. 

Ran into him a week or so later at a small gathering with friends. We started dating and ended up getting engaged after a few years together. Definitely didn't see that coming when I got pulled over."
Keeping track of all the bills/dates/activities. Also I’m not sure anyone knows how much work it actually takes to thoroughly clean a house.
"Mrs. Doubtfire really doesn’t sit right with me when I see it nowadays. On the surface sure, he wants to spend more time with his kids, but then he deceives his family, and then I think tries to kill Pierce Brosnan or something? I want to like it, but it always makes me uneasy."
I don’t mind it as long as he doesn’t smack me too roughly. I don’t find it pleasurable but the thought that he enjoys it is a good feeling. Now if he were to come up and hug me from behind.... 🥰
"i was lucky enough to be raised by parents with this situation. 

my mom was raised Jewish (went to Hebrew school and Temple) and my dad was raised Catholic (went to private Catholic school and Church). 

neither of them felt particularly connected to their religions, and raised my sisters and i to be educated on all faiths and come to our own conclusions. we celebrated all the holidays in the commercial sense and never attended temple or church. 

i am so grateful for this upbringing, learning about different religions and being able to decide myself what i believe, rather than have religion forced on me. 

i know this isn’t exactly what you asked for but maybe it can provide a different perspective"
"I became a mean girl to stop being a victim. I couldn't get away from my tormentors. I tried hiding in the library. I tried eating lunch in the music room. I tried telling the teacher. When none of it worked, I tried being scarier. And that worked.

So, my parents could have fought harder on my behalf  when I started getting bullied, instead of expecting me to toughen up, so I didn't have to topple the social order with mean girl tactics to make it stop, myself, and then maintain my mean girl ways to keep from once again being a victim, at least until I escaped to college where I found people I didn't feel like I had to be on guard all the time around and could retire my barbs and talons."
"My ex was one of those men who are traditionally attractive: tall, masculine face, athletic. While on the other hand, I wasn't so much of a model myself. I'm the most average looking person you will ever meet, and that sentence didn't even come from myself, someone actually said that when I was in high school.

One of the most tiring thing besides having much hotter girls try their shot at him is when people comment on how hot he is and how he could've done so much better. This is because his exes are incredibly hot, even I don't understand why he chose me at the time. His friends' surprised mixed with confused faces when they met me was heartbreaking. His cousin's asking how his ex was in front of me was tormenting. It made me extremely insecure, not because of my ex, but because of the people around him who are used to his attractiveness and his attractive partners.

We broke up after 6 months of dating because he cheated on me with his model &amp; pageant ex-girlfriend. It was a dark time for my self confidence."

"A new-ish friend invited me to his housewarming party, I was only 1 of 3 people invited but didn’t know this until I arrived and saw the table set for 4 people. My 2 friends in attendance (a married couple) who were trying to set me up with him, were in on it. The night turned into this awkward double date situation. 

He took us all on a tour of his home, which was nice until my friends mysteriously disappeared once we reached his bedroom. I poked my head in and tried to walk on because I started to get weird vibes from him and felt strange about going into his bedroom alone but he insisted that we check out his closet. Once inside, he tried to make some moves and told me I could have 3/4 of the closet space when I eventually move in with him! He already had a couple of my things hanging up in it too. These items of mine were things I had lent to my married friend and she bought them along to help him, so I could picture myself living with him?! I was totally creeped out by this point. 

He didn’t need to go to those lengths, if he had asked me out on a date like a normal person, I would’ve said yes but after that experience I was way too weirded out. I eventually fell out with my friends who introduced us cos I couldn’t trust them anymore and was suspicious of their intentions whenever they’d invite me anywhere."
"Was wearing an ac/dc shirt in high school, friend of mine said I wasn’t a real fan unless I could name 5 of their songs. I could so I did, he fell quiet.
Was also riding my bike in a Beatles T-shirt in college, some old guy said I was too young to know who they were, I just yelled “Music doesn’t expire!!” as I passed by."
"Being “crazy.”   (My ex husbands go to when I had suspicious of him cheating- which were correct- or anything else which resulted in a disagreement, it was always my mental “instability”)"
"A tinder date I didn't expect to like, while I was just flirting around after my divorce. Thought he was kinda cute, was nice, but didn't think it's go anywhere (and honestly didn't want it too, finally being free and all) well, we actually hit it off. I told him I wanted to go slow, but as fate would have it he was just too damn perfect. 

Only 6 months, and one deployment, later he's sitting next to me on our bed, talking about getting a dog while we watch our show. 

Sometimes... It's just the lil jokes and quirks that reel you in, no matter how hard you want to resist."

"I was helping to host a dinner party at my sister's place. The doorbell rang while my sis had her hands full, so I answered it.

"Most of them stemmed from my anxious attachment style. I was controlling and critical of my ex-partner.

"He lost a childhood friend after calling her a slur and hanging out with wizard nazis who thought she was the 'inferior race'. He then obsessed about her for years, decades, always, and was absolutely ok with wizard Hitler killing her husband and infant son so long as she was spared.

Lily was totally justified in breaking things off and more people should respect that.

Not to mention he was a bullying, biased teacher. Seriously, being shot down when you're 15 is not justification for adult shittiness."
"Husband told me over and over and over that I wasn't healthy, I was manipulative, I was slowly killing him, I needed help. 

It took a big huge blow up argument in a hotel 11 hours away from home for me to get my shit together and realize I needed to change. Still working on it, still together but not sure for how long? 

TLDR; Was so toxic I almost drove my husband to his breaking point to realize it."
"As I was getting ready for bed yesterday, I realized that I always fluff my boyfriend's pillow and position it. He probably doesn't notice it, because I always go to bed before him, and I didn't even notice it before yesterday, but at least his pillow is always ready for him!"

"One night I was at some of my guy friends place after they had a party. It was late and there were only a handful of people still hanging out. I was sitting in the living room and this guy I have met a few times before comes in and starts excitedly talking to me about how he has wanted to get to know me, blah blah blah.

"I’ve shared my story before, but here it goes. When I was in college I met the perfect guy, I instantly knew he was the one. We clicked right away, we had fun together, it was great. We were together 2 years when he proposed. Of course I said yes, he was my soul mate and I didn’t even believe in that stuff. We had a great future planned out and everything was going soooo good. Less than a year before our wedding he was hit head on and died the next day. So it’s pretty safe to say I spent A LOT of time convinced I’d never find anybody. For one, I promised myself to him, I didn’t want to be with anybody else. And two, nobody could love me the way he did. 

(But there’s a good part to the story) Fast forward to this very moment that I’m typing this. I did find love again, very unexpectedly.  I walked into his work and was just mesmerized by him.  After talking for a while he made me realize I was capable of feeling things I thought I’d never feel again.  And it just happened out of nowhere. I definitely didn’t wake up that morning and think “I’m gonna find a man today”. 

And I’m currently cuddled up with our baby, rocking him to sleep.❤️"

"Peter Pan. 
As a child he seems like this wonderful kid what wants to have fun forever. You see a much darker side to that/those film(s) when you’re an adult. 

Ever seen one of those pictures that says “Peter Pan was basically the angel of death and the Lost Boys were dead” and you laugh and think it’s clickbait? No bro! Read the book, Peter Pan is a nasty murderous little shit."
"I’m only young, but I was so in love with a guy that I thought and hoped and prayed I would end up with. At the time, I thought “this is it”, I was so head over heels and we got on so well that I thought that was what love was meant to be like. But then I realised after we broke up, that it was so unhealthy, so toxic. He didn’t love me, he crossed boundaries all the time, made me feel dumb, made me insecure. He made me into someone I hated, and he wasn’t anywhere near as great as I thought.

Realising that is a big step. Maybe your ex was amazing, but maybe they weren’t too. And that’s okay. My ex cheated and was mean, but I don’t hate him for it, I don’t think he’s particularly a bad person. I just don’t see the point in letting him still have power over me and my feelings anymore.

Not long after I came to this realisation I met someone new. Within only 2 weeks of us seeing eachother, we were so much healthier than my whole 1+ year relationship with my ex. We talked openly about what we both wanted, our worries etc. He really has been the person that I had wished my ex would have been. The difference is though, this new guy is better. 

If you’d have told me just months ago that I would get over my ex and meet someone 100x better, more thoughtful, caring, kind, that would actually listen to me and respect me, I would have laughed. I didn’t think I wanted anyone else, and didn’t think I’d find someone else. But that’s not true, you will. The rose tinted glasses come off and you realise that the only reason things had been good with your ex is because you put the time into knowing them. Once you give someone else an opportunity, you’ll realise how amazing it is to start over again and learn about someone and go through that journey with them."
"I met my fiancé in Austria - we were both traveling for roughly the same amount of time and met in the tiniest town in the Alps. I knew he was the one right away even though I had said I was going to take a break from dating. We are both Canadians, and I had been looking at applying to a university in his city, which I eventually did. I was accepted, got a fantastic scholarship, moved there, and now we are getting married this summer!"
Well I don't need to comment because you summed me up perfectly. Took me a long time to become self aware and stop repeating an abusive cycle!
"I honestly feel bad for most of the people I dated before I hit my late 20s. I was a product of abuse I couldn't see past. I'm sure dating me was a mind fork for at least a few of them.
I started to realize how I acted affected others when I was treated similarly. I started to read books on how the mind works, then I read Eckhart Tolle. When I started working in the mental health field, holy smokes Batman. That was a eye opening experience. 
Since then I've read all I could online, talked to professionals and have worked hard to just do better. 
I'm no means perfect, I still mess up a ton but I force myself to apologize and try to fix my mistakes. It's an ongoing battle that I constantly all conscious of."

I’ve had the “super hot chicks” blatantly try and pick up my husband in bars and social settings (especially after we got married and they noticed he had a wedding band). Like they get off on the fact they’re prettier and they know it and it’s basically a “look what i can do” situation. Several years ago a girl at Chipotle slipped her phone number in the to go bag lol. 

As we’ve gotten a little bit older it doesn’t happen as much but back in our early 20s it was a struggle. I eventually got used to it. He never reciprocated and would immediately introduce me to whoever was hitting on him. It was definitely a lesson in self esteem early on, I had to learn to have trust in myself and him that I was good enough and he never gave me a reason to think otherwise."

When I have mentioned periods instantly most men get disgusted and shame me for mentioning it.
"I pay attention to what makes they value and what makes them feel vulnerable. Then I find natural ways to build them. The method for these seemingly opposite things is the same.  
 
I'll show genuine curiosity, asking for their knowledge or skills in those things, compliment them, help make time and show interest.    

A friend used to do this for me. It made me feel known, loved.  Like I had another half.  
When it stopped it took a long time to figure out what was missing and how they did it. People have asked me how I know them inside out. 

 Pay attention to what people are doing and why (enjoyment or worry) rather than the things they go out of their way to show you. The first is them as they really are.  The second is the way they want to be seen.  
  
Watching people when they don't know they're communicating at all will tell you more about what they need in you than the words coming out of their mouth."
My friends girlfriend does something similar. She joins the chat waits for the inevitable vulgar insult/greeting (thinking it’s our friend) then politely tells us he’s not home. 😳😆
Being single at my age (48) after getting out of a 26 year relationship.  Dating has most definitely changed since the early 90’s.
"We first met at 14 and I had a huge crush on him for years. When we first met, I felt a jolt - not love at first sight necessarily but a feeling like *Hmm, this person is going to be important to me somehow*. I dated a mutual acquaintance from the time i was 16-21, and he dated a mutual acquaintance in between there from 17 to almost 18. Both of our relationships were dumpster fires, but I honestly believe they were necessary because it gave us time to grow up and realize what we definitely did NOT want but also what we did. We were always friends, but we definitely got closer the summer we turned 20 (we worked at a day camp together) and would hang out here and there. He wanted me to break up with my bf and I honestly should have (he was emotionally, physically abusive and gaslighting to the EXTREME) but I just wasn't ready. We took a break from speaking but then I missed him. Right before we turned 21 we reconnected and we started dating that summer. It was honestly the most accurate feeling of falling in love I have ever felt or ever will feel - like, I can remember down to specific MOMENTS where I knew he was for real and that it was kinda inevitable 

&amp;#x200B;

This year we'll be together for 6 years. We live together, have 2 dogs together, and he dropped me off this morning at work and still kisses me goodbye in the morning. I'M GETTING TEARY EYED YOU GUYS. But it was all so worth the wait. He's really truly my best friend."
"Diane Nguyen from BoJack Horseman. She's known as this quiet bookworm, this bleeding heart who can't stand up for herself, this excellent judge of character and intelligent person, unfortunately terrorized by her husband's hyper adoration because she's an introvert and nobody understands her. But she's horrible! She lies constantly, she's incredibly condescending of her husband and most other people, incredibly selfish, hides behind her ""ideals"" but acts like she's the most authentic person in the room despite accomplishing nothing besides an insulting tell-all and less than a week of humanitarian work that she abandoned. Honestly I can't stand her, and I know that's intentional, but I also know how many people relate to her and that is not a good thing."
"Doing chest compressions on a newborn baby, watching her die literally in my hands while 5 other people managed her ventilator and IV lines. Being the first person to tell a 17-year-old girl and her family that it's not cancer. Sticking a floppy little tube down a kid's nose and watching as the X-ray shows it exactly where I want it in the stomach. 

Every day, I still can't believe that I finally made it to my dream job. It's so surreal that I'm finally here, doing the stuff for real after studying it for years and years and jealously watching other people do it."
Punk guys are the wooorst about this
"Rory from Gilmore girls.

I don't know if I'd necessarily say ""Evil"" but she definitely wasn't as good as she was made out to be."
"Completely agree. I think there is a chronic lack of education for young people regarding healthy relationships. Sure the mechanics of sex are discussed, but acceptable vs. unacceptable behaviours in relationships were never discussed by my parents or while I was in school at all. Given that was a while ago (in my 30s now) but watching my younger relatives grow and talking to them when they have problems I'm not sure things have changed very much."
"If someone wants to be with you, they just will be. True they might not be lying about being busy with work or uni or whatever, but if they really wanted to be with you, they would be. So don’t sit around hoping that “once that project is done” “or once s/he’s graduated” that things will kick off again because 99 times out of 100 they won’t."
"Just ended one. We shared all the same values, life experiences etc. Things were just so easy when I was with him. We shared the same sense of humour so when I phoned him up to say I needed to talk he would answer with ""Who did you kill this time"" and we would just run with it for 10 minutes talking about where to hide the body. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm verging on 30 and are ready to take things to the next level, settle down, start a family. He is not. It's heartbreaking and messy but I know we will both be better off in the long run. It's no one's fault, but we're just not in the same space in our lives right now."
"Yep. He’s an ex for sure. He’s involved with our son, but still pretends like the twins don’t exist. This was 11 years ago, though, so I’m happily remarried. It’s still a moment I’ll never forget!"
Gotta love the men that think someone being hot excuses any of their behaviour towards them.
"This man told me he lived in a mansion and drove an expensive car.... 🙄🙄🙄🙄

I was like "" congratulations on reaching your dreams"""
"I really like it. It makes me feel wanted. I do the same thing to him actually: we’re very, very handsy with each other. We’ve both expressed on several occasions to the other that this was fine, so now it’s just our default."
"Berries! Blueberries, raspberries, strawberries"
"My weight. My ex father in law told me 25 years ago that I needed to remember that ""everyone loves a fat man, ain't no one loves a fat woman"". I wore a size 5 at the time and weighed 105 pounds. Now that I've gotten older and a little thicker in the waist and all this time later, it still rings in my mind. I've never once had a woman comment on my weight...that I know of anyway."
"Absolutely, if they're sane and it's what they want No government or religion should be allowed to interfere. Some people are in chronic pain 24/7 and would welcome it, others with no quality of life too. It should be a personal choice."

"Apples and peanut butter, the most perfect combo ever."
I had the same exact type of relationship that couldn’t grow because of distance from the United States (me) to Europe (him). It’s been almost five years. I think of him all the time and I haven’t found a relationship (even amongst friends) that was even close to being as connective and deep. It breaks my heart.
Cucumber. I like mine sliced with salt and vinegar on.
"No, i didn't. He is literally one of the most respected people in my academic field and I was too afraid that it would come back at me. This was literally the weekend before graduate school started and I reasoned at the time I didn't want to get off on the ""wrong foot."""
"When I refused to have anal sex with him, because it was painful, he told me I “better do it for him or else he’ll have to find it somewhere else”."
"Archie especially. He's supposed to be this loyal and righteous person but he's just an idiot who keeps fucking everything up. Every time he comes on screen my SO and I just go ""oh here he is whats he going to ruin now"""
"Not a band, but similar: It was a Day at a Gaming Convetion in Germany, I cosplayed Genderbent Link (Legend of Zelda). I was approached several times (!!!) by people asking if I even knew who I was. That was absolutely crazy to me. I spent hours on getting to look as best as I can and as closest to the character as I can and everyone else seemed to get some much love and support (I got a lot too but the negative kind of stuck with me more). The next Days I did not wear my Cosplay again because I was so disheartened. Now I'd know better to just do my thing but lil 17yr old me was just so sad."
Suffered considerable trauma from an ex and was unsuccessful in finding a new relationship for ten years. Then I decided to give Tinder one more try and met my wonderful SO. It's almost like I needed to endure and experience life on my own to become the person I am now. Like they say you can't love another until you love yourself.
Its kind of a time and place dealio. Sometimes I find it playful and cute and other times it's a little unwanted.
"I watched the last episode last night and it made me *so mad* how he kept going to Ralph Lauren to try to get her rehired behind her back when she was making preparations to move to Paris for her dream job. And chases her to the airport. And she actually gets off the plane. UGH. 

Such bullshit how everyone except Joey gets their happy ending, when overall he’s actually the best “friend” to everyone. Which I know they did because he got a spin-off, but it’s still so unsatisfying to watch. 

Also, no one in their right mind would just give up that rent controlled apartment. Anyone would keep paying rent on it at least for a little while. Ross and Rachel, if they just *have* to be together, should have taken it over and repainted etc. to make it more “adult.” But I digress."
"Also, forgive yourself for not being the person they wanted you to be. I feel this is crucial, and what took me the longest to do when my marriage fell apart."

I can’t take it. The food thing really gets me. Dammit Jeffrey your bowl is half full you’re not going to starve! 

But I’m definitely getting used to him. Sucks that he has to shit in a box of sand though, what a mess. If only he had thumbs"

"It always bothered me that the show seems to demonize Cersei’s obsession with the throne while glorifying Dany’s, but now I think the show was smarter than I have it credit for. I think we’re going to see her become the shows villain this season, and when we look back it will have made sense all along. 

Dany’s first instinct is to approach people as their superior, but respect is something you earn, not something you’re born with."

I can appreciate that it was a groundbreaking show at the time but I feel like it hasn't aged well."
"i had a class with this guy but we were never more than acquaintances at the time. we went the whole semester just exchanging pleasantries everyday, but i did have a pretty enormous crush on him that i figured would go nowhere. then my brother passed away and this guy ended up being the first person outside of family whom i confided in. i told him what had happened and he looked at me with love in his eyes. he gave me his number and offered to listen to me anytime. for some reason, it was different hearing that from him. i sure as hell wasn’t looking for a relationship at that point and he wasn’t either but here we are, 5 months later, happily in love. guys, i wanna marry him someday!!"
"Let’s see.... while nursing, I’ve had an older male patient offer to be my sugar daddy and pay my tuition. Once at the mall, a creepy 30-something year old guy offered to buy me $500 worth of merchandise at VS as long as he could watch me try it on. Growing up in L.A., I had to deal with porn recruiters after school. Granted, they weren’t trying to seduce me but it was still a sex-related mission or whatever."

"There are always men who will want to take advantage of how I feel about them. They will lead me on, give me hope and then abandon me once their fun is over. If I feel instantly attracted to someone, I don’t show it anymore. I wait and see what they’re like really, and then make a decision. I will not be used again."
Jim is like kind of a bully to Dwight to be honest
"52 and don’t regret it. I don’t hate kids, but I thought I’d always be single, &amp; I had no desire to be a single parent. Then I actually did get married after age 30, and the thought of having to be responsible for others 24/7 for nearly two decades scared me half to death. Found out I couldn’t have kids anyway, &amp; just couldn’t work up the enthusiasm to adopt.

I’ve been able to have a fulfilling career, do some traveling, &amp; not be thought of merely in terms of my relationships to others. A friend of mine signed all her e-mail “Kevin’s Mommy “ rather than her own name for years, &amp; I hated the idea of losing my identity that way. Instead, I am the Cool Aunt to my nieces &amp; nephews."
And it really doesn't matter if a band is old or not. A 10 year old today could use YouTube or Spotify to listen to Black Sabbath or REO Speedwagon. It's not like you have to listen to music made after you were born.

"This is funny to me because I married a Jewish man (genetically, not practicing) and he said to me the other day that he wants to raise our 3 kids to be Jewish. 

I told him he couldnt eat shellfish anymore, no more Christmas, and that hed have to keep Shabbat. 

He said, ""Whats that?""

So for us, its working out pretty well because its still making me giggle."
"Zero.  Unless you count the dudes who shout crap at me on the street, then some.

I don't really go places where someone would approach a date, and I live in the suburbs where it's not really common to talk to other people."
"Actually going through the breakup of this exact thing right now. We have been dating for over 2 years and are honestly perfect together. We’ve managed to create a relationship where we are best friends and love doing anything and everything together. We rarely fight, but when we do we can calmly communicate about the situation and come to a resolution easily. We have fun constantly and feel the most comfortable when with each other. 

But we need to break up because of our separate professional. We both still have to finish college, and there is no one college we can go to together that offers our different degrees that we can also afford to go to. The job he is pursuing requires that he can up and move anywhere in the country each year for the first 5 years. And mine I have to stay in one place and build myself up. 

We started out doing long distance for about a year, and really don’t see it possible to do it again indefinitely. So we’re breaking up. It’s incredibly devastating, but it’s what we both have to do."
"I was born in Toronto but moved to the country as a young kid. My dad was born and raised there so I often spent summers there as a kid, and we visited fairly frequently. I also went to university in Toronto

My best friend and I, during university, both bought matching sweaters that say ""Toronto vs. Everybody."" 

I have since moved abroad. One day, while wearing said sweater, a guy stopped me and asked, ""Have you ever even been to Toronto?"" 

Granted, I can't expect this random to know I'm Canadian, since we'd never met, but it blew my mind that a non-Canadian would try to gatekeep merchandise from our largest city."
"“What would your brother think if we were having sex”

I’m not sure this was even a seduction, lol. An awkward 17 year old boy asking this to an awkward 14 year old girl. I was super creeped out though."

"I climbed the stairs to the bedroom (robe and slippers, mug of chamomile tea--to set the scene) just in time to see my then-bf pulling on the panties I'd worn that day. His balls flopped out the side... he looked up at me with this delighted expression... and he waggled them at me.

Until that moment, I had never literally rolled on the floor laughing my ass off. He had to come get me from the hallway. And we never spoke a word about it, then or since."

"Was single and mingling for 2 years straight after a bad breakup.  Joined dating app when iPhone 3/4 had just came out.  First day, talked to two guys. Come to find out, they were roommates but they were both at their perspective jobs when they reached out to me.  They found out they were talking to the same chick (me) when they got home. 

One had more attractive profile pictures while the other was, “Meh.”  

The one I wasn’t too into came out and met me and my buds at a bar one night for the first time.  Needless to say, I feel head over heels.  He was way more attractive in person.  
His roommate was miffed he went out to meet me first without him.  Lol 
We had originally talked about me bringing a friend and the four of us would meet up.  (This did happen later) 

Still in love with my guy!  Sometimes you just gotta just power through the initial profile picture and be pleasantly surprised.  (We’ve been together 10yrs now) 🤗"
"Maybe Jenny Humphrey from Gossip Girl?

"I grew up poor and was mostly working class in my adult life (I'm edging towards middle class now, if it weren't for those pesky student loans) but I've dated a few people who were wealthy. I mostly found I would have to remind them that things they thought of as universally ""inexpensive"" really weren't: that most people couldn't easily go on a tropical vacation or drop $100 on dinner. 

At the same time, they taught me that when possible, spending a little extra on quality would save me money in the long run: think the Sam Vimes Boot Theory here, in action. They also taught me that as I gained more financial security, it wasn't morally wrong for me to treat myself sometimes."
Would you mind sharing a few of them?
"Not that I think I'm ""hot"" but this reminded me of an acquaintance of mine (who expressed feelings for me that I did not return long before this) when he took a picture of me at a party (without my consent and in secrecy) then sent it to me in a message saying: ""You look so pretty and you're doing this?!"" By ""this"" he meant... Sitting. I was sitting alone looking at my phone. 


Just... -_-"
"Yes, I have had family members and very occasionally an acquaintance will ask. Close friends accept me and support and understand my choices (as I do theirs). My sister asked me the most questions about my decision. I have a suspicion that she still holds onto a belief that I chose not to have children because I was/am afraid of being abusive. My dad was abusive. It's an ugly thing to think about someone. I told her she was wrong. I told her I didn't have children because I knew I would be a great parent, couldn't not be otherwise, and that I want to have a different life, one that let's me know myself, choose for myself, express myself. People who have children often say that those of us who don't have children don't know what we're missing. The reverse is true as well. People like to perpetuate a myth, especially about women who are single and do not have children. That myth is that we are sad, lonely, unloved and unlovable. Those kinds of beliefs--that marriage and/or children make women happy or that the absence of a partner and children make women sad--are prisons. I choose to see my life is a beautiful mystery regardless of whether I have a partner or children. There are an infinite number of ways to love and be loved."

When he was in college he hosted a “chicken nugget party” and made a bunch of different dipping sauces. Nobody showed up to his party and he just ate a massive amount of chicken nuggets by himself. I wish I didn’t know because it makes me sad to think of my lovable goofy husband gorging himself on chicken nuggets all alone but it also makes me giggle and then I feel bad.

"I went to a concert and a man proceeded to quiz me about all the current and former members of the band and what instrument they each played. I was like, “I don’t know who the drummer was for that one month in 1997 and I don’t give a f*ck, just let me enjoy the music”."
Holy shit dude
"When I was still in college, I was wearing Led Zeppelin shirt. A guy tried to tell me Robert Palmer was their lead singer and ask if I was sad that he’d died.

"I’m 53, and the youngest of six brothers and sisters. They all had kids. Lots of kids. I became the defacto babysitter. I love all my nieces and nephews but I’m not a “baby” person. I don’t regret not having kids as I inherited a wonderful step daughter. I got all the adult with only a little bit of a teenager. For me, this has been P.E.R.F.E.C.T.! She is the best daughter I could ever imagine. Is she biologically mine, nope. Do I care, nope."
"He certainly wasn’t all that attractive internally then, if he was willing to cheat on you, and the company he kept sounds like another huge indicator of that. I hope you’re doing much better now and understand that the beauty of one’s soul counts for a whole hell of a lot."
"OMG I am so sorry. Same thing happened to my best friend, but it was papers for a baby that was conceived while she was on bedrest after going into labor with their child at 5 months pregnant."
"Sure thing! I had just turned 17, and my boyfriend and I had been dating for 5 months when I found out I was pregnant. Typical teenage invincibility, or so I thought. I'll be honest I don't think I ever entertained the possibility of keeping the baby. And although I'm pro choice, I felt like I couldn't handle an abortion. I connected with the adoption agency pretty early on (I believe I was around 11 weeks) and I found a couple that I absolutely adored and I was able to meet with them several times through the pregnancy. My boyfriend and I broke up. I was induced at 39 weeks, and I decided to allow the adoptive parents in the room with me. When he was born, he was given to his mom for skin-to-skin, then to his dad. I didn't hold him. It was difficult but also incredibly comforting to see how much they already loved their boy. He just recently turned 10 years old! We get photos and updates from his family, and hope one day we can visit. His dad and I eventually got back together, we both went to University and got great jobs. We got married and had a daughter. Sometimes I wonder what it would have been like to raise him, but I know I made the right decision for everyone."
Men usually have boring profiles and bad pictures.
"I'm all for it. I'm usually hornier when I have my period and my boyfriend likes it, so I don't see any issues. I have a sky high libido and the thoughts of going a quarter of my life with no sex because of a little bit of blood seems horrific to me."
"I was on vacation with a bf and I woke up in the morning and had to pee. I noticed he wasn't in bed, but figured he was having a morning cigarette on the patio. I stumbled to the bathroom and turned the light on and found him naked on the toilet using a fork to eat mixed fruit from a can. ***In the dark***. I was the reason the light was on."
"I went on a handful of dates with a guy that was INSANELY rich. Mom was a neurosurgeon and his dad was like owner of a nuclear plant or something. Idk. They literally had a full staff in their house of cooks, assistants, trainers, etc. 

Honestly I was just so uncomfortable. My parents both worked 2 jobs for most of my life. I was the only one in my family for the past 3 generations who went to college-and I didn’t even graduate because I couldn’t afford it. 

He could never understand where I came from really. Being poor shapes who you are. The fact that I am/was so used to the idea of living paycheck to paycheck and even not making it until then-he would never understand that. He’s never had to. 

I would save napkins at fast food places for my car, and save the extra sauce packets, etc. he told me once that it was tacky. It might be, but you better believe there’s been times I want honey barbecue sauce with my homemade burger and I am so glad I had a packet."
Wow. Talk about taking responsibility and owning your shit. That’s a lot of personal growth. I wish you well in future loves!

"My son's father (we've been separated for 9 years) is a beautiful man. Tan skin, green eyes, Samoan/Dutch mix, nice body, etc. 

I would constantly hear other women say, 'She's ugly, how did she get him?'. People found it hard to believe we were together. 

He cheated on me so many times, I even find it hard to believe we were together so long. Women love him and he loves women. 

He met his current partner and started dated her while we were still together. Then he broke up with me and moved in with her. She's a beautiful woman. She actually believe he cheated on me because of the way I looked.

Until he started cheating on her."

"Not a mean girl, but sister of mean girl. My parents were Ayn Rand fans, which apparently was some pretty edgy, controversial BS when they were in college. They apparently raised my older sister to win at all costs, so she plowed through public school without the benefit of an internal morality. 

&amp;nbsp;



I was born with a conscience much later and constantly called both her and my parents out for their lack of charity towards others. I was in high school by the time my parents figured out that my bully sister was friendless and unhappy because of her shameless ambition to win at all costs, but it was too late.

Sis is at the top of her field, financially comfortable and acquisitive as hell
 Logos, status symbols, conspicuous consumption. The works, but no friends or solid romantic relationship.

Guys, you gotta teach your kids charity and respect for all human beings. Sometimes empathy is innate, but when it isn't, a bully rises. 

&amp;nbsp;

The current political climate in the US is ripe for creating bullies, too. I have a little one in public school and I fear what the parents of her peers are modeling.

*Tell* them how to care for others, how to appreciate strangers and relate to folks from other socio-economic groups. For most of us morality and community is hard-wired, but for a few lack  empathy and it must be taught and modeled."

Before I could answer, he squinted his eyes at me and suspiciously said, ""You look too young too actually listen to them."" He was like, 30 and I was 22."
"I had the opposite!

He told me how he still lived at home, and that if we ""made a mess"" his mom would clean my clothes for me. 

He also bragged about never having to lift a finger at home because his mom did everything for him. 

I very politely declined."
"Oh my Godd yeah this smh ~ I'm Indian-American and I've had more than one guy (all white lol before y'all ask) tell me that I'm really pretty for a brown girl or that they like the color and texture of my skin?? Like bruh you're straight up giving me serial killer vibes at this point, that ain't sexy at all. And they get hella defensive when I point out that their statements are lowkey problematic and make me feel uncomfortable. It's a struggle our there lmao"
"Dated this girl in high school. Was as in love has high schoolers get. We dated for almost a year, she decided she wanted something else, it wasn’t exactly an amicable break up but it was what it was. Spent 4 years apart, seeing each other occasionally since we had a lot of the same friends, both of us dated around a little and both of us got into some mentally and physically abusive long term relationships, learned and grew as people, and then one night, after getting out of my own bad relationship, I decided to get out of the house and go to her graduation party. We got to talking and found out we still had a bunch in common and ended up at home together that night. He we are 10 years later, happily married, 5 year old daughter and just as madly in love as we were in high school. It’s like we got together in those days to see where would end up, but had to grow as people before we were ready for a lifetime together"
"After rewatching recently, I realised that Ross could have gotten ON the plane, Rachel didn’t need to get off! He could of taken a sabbatical, or career break, done some research in Paris or cared for Emma (if Rachel’s salary was so amazing). Why did Rachel have to give it up!?"
I always check that they make it somewhere safely. Whether it’s a text/call after a long trip or waiting the extra few seconds until they’re inside the door. I’m overly aware if others do the same for me and I’m often left disappointed.
"Matched with him on Tinder and we chatted for a bit and followed each other on socials. We made plans to meet but I wasn’t really that interested and ended up flaking. 
A few months later he reaches out again and I say yes this time. We meet up and I was expecting a nice date but nothing else.
We ended up in each other’s company until 3 AM that night. Talking, walking, and enjoying each other company. Even thought we met that night we felt like so close in shared experiences.
Ended up dating, he was the first guy to ever meet my family and guess what — we didn’t know it but our grandparents grew up in the same village and were neighbours before emigrating to America and losing touch of each other. 

THat extra touch of fate/coincidence makes our relationship feel too good to be true. I’m so happy ❤️"
YES! Season 7 finally made me realize how power hungry she is and how she’s turning into her father.
"Actually giving a shit. My mom was a very “ignorance is bliss” kind of person. I found my way after high school and turned out fine, but I was an awful kid through jr high and high school."

You stop fighting bc it's not worth it anymore
I'm not entitled to anything from any guy. Just because I want it to happen doesn't mean it will.
I propose a petition to ban the “what do you think of guys who do *X*.” Askmen banned those type of questions because they were sick of ‘em.

"Water.

recently started dating someone new and he spent the night one day. in the middle of he night I get up to get a glass of water and he's sitting at the island in the kitchen in complete darkness eating sweet and sour sauce.
"I was gifted a shirt by a friend, it was in a style similar to the Guns N’ Roses logo, but not the actual logo. A professor I had my freshman year of college saw me wearing that shirt and attempted to quiz me on Guns N’ Roses and said “Do you actually like them or do your parents” and I had to point out that it wasn’t actually the logo, just a design."
"My husband was laying in bed watching a movie and moving around trying to get comfortable, and at one point laid on his back and pulled his knee into his chest, then kissed it... like the most normal, natural thing in the world... then put his leg back down, all while being totally fixated on the TV and oblivious that I was watching..."
Sugar snap peas!
"Man here, but this. Ex recently broke up with me and I thought I'd be spending the rest of my life with her. Bad bad bad feeling."
"Being ugly. I used to be ugly sometimes, and it's like that's a seen as a personal insult to some males."
"I like to make a salad and top it with ranch seasoning and red wine vinegar...saves on the calories from actual ranch dressing and has such an amazing flavor.  I drink the leftover vinegar with ranch seasoning in the bottom of the bowl, haha."
"This is so sweet, and I love how you must do that without even thinking about it."
Hope you guys both get the help you need.
"I had learned to like and prefer being on my own. I had been in relationships for most of high school and all of my early 20s. Some were pretty toxic. I took multiple years off to focus on myself. Things became so amazing- I paid off my debt and bought a condo, had 2 dogs, spent lots of time with family/friends, got an amazing new job etc. 

At a certain point I was ready to just have some “physical needs” met, so I cautiously tried our Tinder. I was clear about what I wanted and ensured that I was doing things in a safe way. It was SO empowering to focus on my needs. I had one guy expect a BJ and left before reciprocating so it was a quick “buh bye” and onto the next arrangement. I was able to explore my sexuality in a way I never thought I’d be able to. There were some oddballs that didn’t respect my “no feelings” rule, but overall a truly positive experience. 

When I was 31 there was a guy visiting my country from Scotland. He was looking for a local to show him around. We had a good time and I was thankful that I wouldn’t have to worry about this one expecting more since there was an expiration date... well 10 months later we got married and we’re about to celebrate our 2 year anniversary! We were both just in a spot in our lives where we were truly happy on our own and were both ready to open up to someone else."

My height! When I am with my girls they boost me up but my first ever boyfriend told me that I was too tall. Like sorry dude ??? I didn’t pick my body out at Macy’s!
"To each their own, but my mind can't process the idea of my bf penetrating someone else and be okay with it. It hurts my whole body just thinking about it. I would end the relationship if that's what he wanted."
You peel them? I just bake in oven and skin pops right off pretty much
:( did you report it or anything? No judgment if you didn’t! Just want to know if there was any follow up.
"This isn't a unique story, but I'm not a fan of being asked out on a date in the context of ""let's hang out sometime."" I had one particularly bad offender with this, and I'd say it's the worst. I knew this guy in one of my college classes, and we worked together on a couple things. He kept saying we should hang out sometime, and I said sure. Then it became obvious his idea of hanging out was going out on a date. But he wouldn't call it that. Just kept saying he wanted to hang out sometime. But then he suggested dinner just the two of us on Friday. Like sorry, the plans you're suggesting are a date. This phrasing puts the other person in an awkward spot because I didn't want to turn him down for just hanging out, but I had no romantic interest. But saying that bluntly makes me sound presumptuous, because he would never call it a date. For what it's worth, I eventually agreed, and it was definitely a date. He invited me back to his place. I said no and we never hung out again.

Tldr: if you want to ask someone on a date, call it a date. Don't cop out and pretend it's just a friendship thing."
"Being married and falling in love with someone else who is also married. It's just love - no action and we don't keep in touch - but after months and months of no contact, I still feel it stronger than ever. Total mindfuck and I know it makes me a bad person, but I've never felt anything so strongly and I don't know how to turn it off."
"When one of my most cherish family members passed away unexpectedly and his response was ""stop crying and look at the photo I just edited."""
"This is really sad, any way you can explore the potentials of the relationship or are you committed to others?"
"I know I was younger but my high school boyfriend was an absolute piece of shit. Relationship ended when he tried to  assault me on prom night. I was so traumatized by the whole experience I promised myself I wouldn’t even think about guys for at least a year. 

That summer I met my now husband at a BBQ and was instantly attracted to him and he was so nice and different than my ex (I’ll never forget finding $2 flip flops so sexy because my ex wore $800 Italian shoes, in HS) that I loosened my stance on guys a lot. I lost touch with him but I realized guys weren’t all awful and went on a few dates. 

I reconnected with my husband that fall and he was so sweet, earnest and forthright I was instantly in love and well he celebrating our 7th anniversary this summer and I just got done nursing our first baby."
I've been watching Friends for the first time and ROSS IS THE WORST PERSON EVER. I hate him and everything he does.
"See I had the opposite experience - I had been spotting earlier in the day before my bf and I went at one time it so we didn't realize it had gone full fledged until after the act. I was so embarrassed because his sheets got quite a bit on them but he's like ""meh, my washer is stupid insane, they'll be fine."" And they were so no harm done!"
"I'm 52 and zero regrets. 

Having kids never interested me and I wanted to do other things with my life. I don't have any physical or mental issues that would keep me from being a fully involved parent, I just find babies uninteresting and toddlers tedious and I didn't want to be responsible for another life. I've had a great career, done a bunch of traveling, and the adventure isn't over yet."

Try getting it crispy and brown with some garlic and salt by pan frying/roasting. Mmm. Boil it for a few minutes before if you want to. But not completely.
"When I was in high school, I loved The Killers and went to a Killers concert with my sister. When we were there, we got shirts saying “Are We Human Or Are We Dancer?” I was wearing it one day and some guy I didn’t know asked me if I even listened to The Killers. I told him “Yeah, I got this shirt at one of their concerts.”"
"When I was young, I really didn't see myself ever having a healthy long term relationship. I had no models to look up to. Every adult I knew was divorced/had been in an abusive relationship/were stuck in marriages where they hated each other. I always pictured myself being someone who just had fleeting casual flings and no one would ever love me.

So I can't quite believe the situation I'm in now, where I've been with my SO since we were 18 and we're 26 now, and he really opened my eyes to the possibility of love."
"A guy I've known since i was 6 started hitting on me in highschool, calling me to come to his house when his parents weren't there etc. but i always declined. One day we were assigned to do a presentation about something in a group of 6 and agreed to come to his place to make it. Turns out he asked everyone not to come so we could be alone and they all agreed. When i came it was so awkward because he greeted me standing in the doorway wearing a pijama and insisted i sit on his bed. I tried to be polite but he tried to kiss me so i told him i liked him only as a friend. He looked so sad after that and stopped talking to me completely."
"Lots of ""Hey"" and then a request for sex. Or just a picture of a dick. 

I met my husband online. His opener was ""Why are you studying to be an engineer?"" Which was a nice change."
"I agree, hugs are waaaaay better."
"I never did it in my previous relationships because I'd find it embarrassing, but I have period sex with my boyfriend now. To be honest I don't really find it very different to sex at any other time, except obviously a bit messier. We just put a towel down and stick to certain positions (I wouldn't do doggy or reverse cowgirl or anything where I'm really exposed while I'm on my period). It's pretty nice not having to be 'out of action' for a week every month"
"Time really is the only remedy. 
But I try to keep myself as busy as possible 24/7. 

Eventually you’ll realize you went the whole day without thinking about them, and then you’ll do it again and those days will stretch further until finally he only pops up every now and then. It’ll come."
"He was definitely a turd. Didn't work out so well for him, I was far from crushed. I just told him it was proof I was more manly than he could ever hope to be."
"Same here. The first day isn't good because I often feel too bloated/swollen and am bleeding a lot. After that, put a towel down and we are all set."

"Cucumbers are one of my FAVORITE snacks. I swear, I have a full menu of cucumber ideas. Some of my favorites include, but are not limited to:
- Sliced w/ Trader Joe's [chili lime seasoning](https://www.traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer/article/4174)
- Sliced, topped with a little bit of cream cheese and TJ's [Everything Bagel seasoning](https://www.amazon.com/Trader-Joes-Everything-Sesame-Seasoning/dp/B06W9N8X9H) (I am so obsessed with TJ's stuff, obviously)
- Cucumber salad (cucumber, red onion, tomato, avocado, lime juice, salt and pepper)
- sliced with toasted sesame seeds on top and a splash of vinegar (to emulate a cucumber salad you'd find at a Japanese restaurant)

I could go on and on! Thanks for letting me ramble on about cucumber :)"
Mrs Doubtfire really is a great portrayal of divorce. I think it’s one of those movies that feels like an entirely different film when you watch it as an adult because you perceive things differently. I remember my (divorced) mom crying at the end. Now I realize she was probably processing a totally different set of emotions than I was.
"Reading the responses on this post has taught me that the best way to counter these kinds of instances are to ask the person asking me if they can answer their own question. Thanks for the tip, ladies!"

Being in an avalanche. I live in Alabama where it NEVER snows so when we were actually in on on vacation I felt like I was in some sort of movie.
"I actually love this idea and I hope it helps to get rid of these “influencers”.  For me personally, everything is private and I post a few times a year so I could care less how many likes I get.  I remember when Instagram first started and people were just posting pictures for fun and they’d be lucky if they got 3 likes.  People were posting way more interesting things back then instead of trying to curate their fake, perfect online image.  I hope we can get back to that one day."
"Came here to say this. Always thought medicine was fascinating but genuinely believed I was “bad at science” and it wasn’t an option for me, all the way into college. Something freshman year made me want to at least try....so I switched to a biology major sophomore year, but still didn’t tell a soul. I wanted to see if I could handle the coursework first. I thought there was a good chance I’d fail and didn’t want to have to tell anyone if that happened. 

Even after getting into medical school, getting into residency, graduating med school with my MD....the road is so long, the training so intense, the learning curve is just so STEEP. I spent a decade working toward being an anesthesiologist but not feeling like I was a “real” doctor. The years may fly, but the days drag and you get lost in the minutiae of scut work and tests and calls and rotations. You don’t notice the change in yourself. 

Then one day you’re a PGY 4 or 5 and you look up  from your work one day and realize, holy shit, I actually know what I’m doing. I’m actually a REAL DOCTOR and this is what I get to do every day for WORK!!! People want to know MY opinion?! There is a crisis and people are looking to ME for answers? Wait I actually kinda know the answers! Suddenly after over a decade of schooling you realize you ARE that person you always wanted to be and worked so hard to become. It’s a fucking INCREDIBLE feeling. I can still barely believe it. Genuinely feel like I have the best job in the world, and it’s given me a confidence and joy I never even knew was possible."
"I'm sorry I was so mean to you when we were little. I hope you know that I love you, even though we only speak through memes these days."
"Agree, i am not a PDA person at all, and if it happened in a public place I’d be mortified. If he had his hand on my waist and it wandered down a bit, that could be different depending on the location, but to make a spectacle of it is a no no. At home he can do all he pleases."
I may have just realized it from reading this
Zero. Never been approached by a guy.
"Not evil as such, but Ted from How I Met Your Mother. He mopes on and on about meeting the perfect woman, but he treats every woman he meets like crap. Then he judges Barney for being a bad person even though they do all the same stuff. The only difference is that Barney is upfront and honest with what he wants from the women he dates. 

Also, he tells his entire sex life to his grieving kids just so he can ask their permission to ask someone out. Dude be creepy."
"I don't think she's presented as that good. Maybe in the first season or two, but they definitely paint her as pretty flawed later on. That's true of most of the characters in that show, though."

"I'm a sucker for out of the blue sentimentality. Like ""Oh, this song makes me think of when we first met, I love it."""
"Seconding the conflict resolution! My parents NEVER fought in front of me, which I both admire and hate. Never learned how to have a healthy fight until my boyfriend (going on 5 years) taught me. 
My dad and I argued ALL the time, it got so bad when I was around 8 or so we made up a code word “muskrat” for us to both drop it and walk away. WHEN I WAS 8 AND HE WAS A GROWN MAN. It’s taken me 17 years to figure out that that’s not how it’s supposed to work..."
"When I got a flat tire about 10 miles from home on a Sunday and he didn’t want to come help me because he was playing video games. 

Or when he told me my new friends were “overtly sexual and violent in nature” due to their skin color. 

Oh and when I told him I was going out to a club with friends and he told me, “I don’t want a club girl. You need to stop trying to be this bomb shell that you’re not.” 

Yeah byeeeeeee. 

He’s now married to my former best friend. Yuck."
"I'm 27. I talk about it sometimes online, and it's a combination of things like a bad childhood, social awkwardness, early puberty causing MORE awkwardness, and mostly the fact that I've never been allowed to enter a relationship until I was 18, and then the 2 relationships I had after that were abusive. Over the last two years, I've started something with someone who is NOT abusive, but due to our collective issues, the timing for sex, just hasn't been right. But, talking to people IRL; I've actually found myself having to lie about it. I'm not sure if it's a geographical thing, or what, but I notice that whenever someone outright asks me if I'm a virgin or when they last time I ""got some"" was - and reply that I am a virgin, I get treated very differently; almost childlike. I pay my own bills, I live in my own house, and I work 40 hours a week, but as soon as I admit that I've never had sex, I've literally watched friendships diminish as I say it. At work - I watched the other women go from treating me like a contributing member of the team, to basically ignoring me as I speak; but it's not just there. It's like as soon as someone realises, I become less of an 'adult' or less worthy of a conversation in their eyes. 

Sorry for venting - apparently I'm more annoyed by this than I want to be"
He told me that when we break up he will do everything  possible  to fuck up my life (we were engaged  and I was pregnant  with his son at the time of this conversation)
And Tinkerbell tried to murder Wendy. PP kills the Lost Boys if they grow up. It's pretty fucked up!
"I'm a Christian and my husband is agnostic/atheist. It's definitely not something I planned on but we make it work. To be honest we don't talk about it all the time. He knows what I believe on a basic level; I accept that he doesn't believe in God the same way I do. If he asks questions, I answer to the best of my ability. Neither of us want children so that solves the biggest issue. It would definitely be more of a problem deciding how to raise/teach the kids."
"I am 100% a dog person, have owned many, have a career centered around them, currently have one sleeping with her face under my butt. 

&gt;  my cat adopted me  

But this is something I really love about cats. Most dogs will love anyone who gives them a few treats and pets, but cats are usually a whole nother ball game. They really do pick their people."

"I was waiting for a bus at a stop near a defunct Hooters restaurant, and a guy walked up to me and said “do you work here? ...you could!”

Ugh."
"I prefer not to have it. I feel a bit self conscious about it, as my periods are very heavy and I have a lot of blood clots, so it wouldn't be pretty. I know for some people that wouldn't be a problem, but that's just me."

"If I see we're getting low on something, I make sure it doesn't run out (toothpaste, coffee beans, beer, etc.).
I make sure the garbage/recycles get put out on correct day. 
I remember to bring the tickets for performances, and our ear plugs for concerts. Our yard is poop-free because of me. He doesn't trip on scattered dog toys or his shoes because I clean them up every single day.  Friends still invite us over because I respond to texts and calls from them. I research upcoming events and organize get-togethers. Even on days I wake up at 5 am and work 12 hrs, I come home and clean up his dishes and clothes, and get the mail. Sigh. That was depressing."
"Driving in cities stresses me out. He had me drive into the city for brunch because he didn’t feel like it. Berated me the whole time about how bad of a driver I was. When I teared up, he snap chatted a video of it to his friends."
"I didn’t know how to word me experience but what you have said makes so much sense. 

As an adult I’m truly ashamed of the fact I bullied people. At the time I described my behaviour as self defence/defensive but in truth I bullied a few people who were honestly nice to me. I still feel ashamed of it.

I’ve never thought about my mum as a bully but that’s what she was. She was the most vicious and manipulative and always went straight for the jugular.

She would hammer it in how fat I was, how I shouldn’t show my legs/arms/insert body part because they weren’t acceptable/too big/saggy/stretch marks. How my hair was tragic and their was nothing I could do about it (my hair turns out to be really manageable, we never had a blow dryer growing up and my mum didn’t believe in conditioner). How my acne was an embarrassment and obviously due to poor hygiene (it was cystic/hormonal - I used to scrub the living shit out of my face each night). How I should accept what I can get in life bc I’m not smart/pretty/well connected enough to have standards. She would ridicule me in front of her friends, family, teachers, shop assistants... 

As an adult I can see how my Mum didn’t have much self esteem herself, and she projected that with every ounce of her being in to me, her only daughter. I have three brothers who still love and adore her. They constantly harass me about why I don’t call her, why I don’t want to visit and how ungrateful I am.

Truth is I’m 30 next year. I still have no self esteem. I still cover my entire body regardless of the weather. I still in my heart have this constant feeling of inadequacy. I have ghosted potential relationships because I honestly feel like why would anyone want to be with me, all the insults my mum threw at me are embedded.

Thanks Mum /s"
"Giving someone (male) a compliment. ""You're leading every guy on and use them""

"If someone is getting interrupted a lot and talked over in a conversation, I'll make sure to include them and ask their opinion on the topic.

This is such a cute story!! I hope I can be as lucky as you
"It doesn't make you a bad person. It might be helpful to do some intentional emotional work to figure out if your feelings are rooted in something else. I was in a long term relationship with someone and developed really intense feelings for someone else and eventually figured out that it was more because I felt really stagnant in life and what I really needed was to feel alive again. 

If you ask your feelings what they are trying to teach you, it might help you process them. Being curious is almost always more helpful than being judgmental and telling your feelings to turn off."
"If someone really valued and cared about you, you don't even have to ask and plead them to show you effort and affection. Actions tell you more than words so stop making excuses for them."

"Same here. My mom was from a VERY small town where everyone knew each other's business. Her and my dad moved to a big city and had me, but she never grew out of the busybody mentality. So when I was in school, my mom would ask questions about my friends, their parents, where they live, etc. I didn't really realize it was ""ammo"" for her, if that makes sense.

So I grew up hearing things like ""well so and so's family is messed up, their son does x"" and never realized that that kind of info wasn't my business, and not mine to share with others. Got me in a lot of trouble with my friends in middle school for spreading secrets, which then snowballed into fights, ""I never said that"", etc.

I was a mean girl but didn't even know it. And looking back, I see it was kind of a way for me to feel power over people who bullied me for my appearance, clothes—all that. I would spread secrets about those people that I had no business knowing.

Have you found it's a tough habit to unlearn?"
"Long story but I married at 30 after a lot of superfluous relationships, when I went to therapy and realize that I was scared as hell to commitment. I denied for years any problem and always said that I just haven't found ""the right one"". There is no right one until you come to good terms with yourself."
"Mothers can be so harsh on their daughters. My mom would say some vicious things to my sisters casually thinking it's nothing. I just stand there with my mouth gaping then she looks me and goes what? What did I say? Oh come on! 
It's like it's second nature for them to criticize. It's like their daughters are extensions of themselves and they talk to them the way they talk to themselves in their heads. You know how rough of a critique one can be to one's self."
"Here's the dealio with Barney, though. The entire show is Ted telling the story to his children, right? In the end, it turns out Ted is explaining to his children how he's getting back together with Robin AFTER she and Barney were married. SO, it's theorized that Barney has been *greatly* exaggerated and intentionally portrayed as a giant slut by Ted to possibly sway his children into accepting/rooting for their dad getting back together with Aunt Robin."
I wore a D&amp;D related shirt to work one day and a guy (who knows me quite well and knows that I’m into nerdy stuff) IM’d me to ask me if I actually knew what was on my shirt. I asked him why the fuck I’d be wearing it if I didn’t.
"My husbands family were very well off after having a very successful small business. His mom viewed me with suspicion from the word go and over the years has accused me of wanting to steal everything from her silver to a grandfather clock. His dad was great but he died in a car accident a little under a year after we met. What is crazy is I haven’t gotten so much as a birthday card from her over the years but she’s spent well over 7 figures trying to impress her boyfriend. Their once beautiful home looks like a hoarder pile inside and out with all the garbage shes bought on his behalf. So far all the accusations that I was only with my husband to rob him (and her) blind, she did it to herself. We are NC but she was on the verge of reverse mortgaging her house because she was broke. 

It bothers my husband to no end that his and our daughters financial legacy had been pissed away on a guy she met because he was good at line dancing. 

I basically learned that a nice bank account doesn’t in any way equal a good person."
"Alex Russo from Wizards of Waverly Place. Manipulative, lazy, selfish, and just overall treats others like absolute garbage.

"Medjool dates! They’re high in vitamins and provide fibre! They may also be high in sugar but I find I only need one, maybe two to satisfy my craving. I’m not a sweet tooth so I can’t say for sure, but compared to milk chocolate the taste is much more complex and satisfying to me that I don’t feel I crave more."

"My roommate in college was a gossip and mean girl. When her parents showed up for a visit, my roommate acted anxiously and intimidated by her own mom. After hearing her mom condescend her and talk rudely about others, I was like, ""Ah so that's where she learned it..."". Then I felt sad."

"I call this one ""bachelor guac"" even though it's delicious for all genders and I'm actually married. Take an avocado half, cube it with a butter knife, and remove it from the skin with a large dinner spoon into a coffee cup. Add some salt, lime, and Tobasco. Measure nothing. You know what has most of the rest of the ingredients of guac? Salsa. Take some generic jar of salsa and splash a bit of that in there. Mix it up gently. You want it to be a smooth enough to be considered guac, but *just* chunky enough to break a Tostitos scoops chip. At this point though it'll be just chunks and that's fine. Taste it. It's gonna suck in some way. Tastes like nothing? Add salt. Not enough bite? More lime. Needs more depth of flavor? A bit of salsa. Need some more kick? Shake of Tobasco. Why Tobasco, and not your local boutique $8 5oz bottle of Butt Reaper? Because Tobasco tastes like nothing. It just adds heat. That's what we want here. Keep adding and stirring until you get something that tastes good. Oh no, you added too much of everything and it tastes terrible? You still have a whole second half of avocado, right? Make more guac. When your satisfied, you should naturally be at that perfect consistency. It'll also be grey and gross looking. That's why it's in a coffee cup. Don't look at it, just eat it. It's delicious. Best enjoyed by spooning onto tortilla chips in your underwear alone on your couch watching a show that you're using to avoid responsibly."
"“I want to impregnate you and abandon the child” 

“I want to know what your armpits smell like”"
"I did the same thing. My husband was fussing about how he does all of the cleaning and wanted me to help more. Then I explained to him all of the invisible labor I do: grocery shopping, schedule &amp; take our son to  all of the appointments, budgeting, account balancing, bill paying, all of our short and long term money planning, birthday gifts, taking our son to the library each week, etc. I could literally see his face change with the light bulb because he didn’t realize or notice all of the other stuff I was doing until I pointed it out."
That's the most ideal kind of upbringing I can imagine. The world needs more of such families to become more tolerant and accepting of each other. You're lucky :)
"Being raped by my boyfriend. 

I was never one of those girls who thought, ""oh but that would never happen to *meEeEeEe*."" I knew better than to think that. But I never thought there would be a day where someone who was supposed to love me, someone whom I trusted, would be the person that raped me."
"Yeah, and it sucked. I was very abusive in my first relationship. I had a lot of anger and displaced it. I was immature and not self aware. Terrible at communicating and never expressed my feelings. I wasn’t taught how. My partner wasn’t a saint but no one deserves to be abused! 

I learned from that relationship and started figuring myself out and told myself I would never treat someone like that again however, I was abused in my second relationship. Karma right? It’s left some pretty bad psychological scarring hopefully it’s not permanent. That relationship made me realize I’ve got some major issues I need to resolve before ever getting into another relationship."
I’m both the old fart annoyed by neighborly noise and raver who still rolls in at 6am on occasion.

What a monster. I'm so sorry that happened :/
"Apparently, us random internet strangers are easier to talk to than women in their life, and for the socially inhibited folks, that's fine. But it's frustrating to witness men trying to make themselves appealing to *women* in general, since there are no ""women in general"" when it comes to preferences. We are half of the population, some like things others hate, some are older, some are younger, some are not even interested in men, some lived as men for a portion of the lifes... An OP trying to hook up won't find much help here, he has to meet individuals and see them as individuals. The sex and behaviour advice we can give should be common sense already."
"Lots of situations, but primarily negative ones:

- being raped
- being beaten and physically assaulted
- being choked/strangled and left for dead
- watching a terrifying accident that was almost certain to kill me but didn't by random chance
- having a heart attack"
"I plan around them, even when we haven't made official plans yet and I'm just going over our usual patterns."
per day? wth? you could be the best looking woman in the world and the answer would still be zero. i got approached once this year where a dude asked for my number.
"My kidney stone was worse, but the fact that I didn’t know (at the time) it was a kidney stone, played a big role I guess. It hurt continuously for several hours, I threw up from the pain and I was convinced I was going to die for sure...because it just cannot be harmless when it hurts THAT much.
With my baby I knew in advance it was going to hurt, and I knew why, and I knew what’s happening with my body. I also knew there will be a reward at the end of it🙂. So it wasn’t as bad as kidney stone.
Also, contraction pains roll over as a wave and there’s a little bit time to rest between them. That was definitely not the case with my kidney stone. Yeah, stone was worse."
I think Ted Mosby should be there with him too. There's so many times where he's acted like a complete ass.
"I could spend an entire Saturday cleaning things like light fixtures and baseboards and my husband would not even know I had done anything. You would think since he watches me do it, he would, but he doesn’t. We have made some progress, he did detail the fridge a few weeks ago. Baby steps."
"Being forcefully kissed. I went on a date with this guy that I had met in my gym (he was my coworker's friend's brother). We had just arrived at the restaurant when out of nowhere he put his hand behind my neck and stuffed his tongue down my throat. To top if off, he used his hand behind my neck so I wouldn't push away. I legit have never been more scared in my life! Worst date eveerrr!"
Artichokes.
"I was almost ready to blow off a tinder date because I was in a crappy place in my life. I was drinking and smoking weed every night and would sleep in until noon. I rescheduled him about two times and almost completely bailed on him to so I could go back to sleep when my instincts told me not to bail. I met up with him at the local Starbucks and I didn’t fall in love immediately but he definitely caught my attention. It felt like he was supposed to be in my life but I wasn’t sure how or why. 

We became fast friends and with the friendship I became a much more stable person over three months. I learned that my bad habits were results of depression and I stopped the weed and alcohol and the constant sleeping. I asked him to kiss me one night and we’ll be celebrating one year of dating soon! I don’t know if he’s the One but all I know is that he’s my best friend and he makes me a better person."
"I would figure out wtf I want to do before actually starting.

I went back to college recently, and it has been a night and day difference in how much better it's gone now that I have a direction I know I want to go in. Plus, the extra life experience is very helpful."
This sums up my experience as well. My anxious attachment to an avoidant type drove me to some really awful behaviors. Did a lot of reading and realized how harmful I had been to him and our relationship. Not that he's off the hook but we're talking about me here.
But it can be argued that Dwight also asks for it. He tries to get him fired all of the time. Jim saves Dwight more than a few times. It can be argued both ways.
By telling me how much he he makes and asking if I want to hook up with a rich guy. Something about his dick being a big as his bank account.

"Unfortunately enough without sufficient evidence you could be sued for slander/defamation for outing someone, terrible thing though."
"Veronica is actually the worst, I'll never understand why she always goes back to her dad when she knows he is actually evil. She thinks she's so amazing and powerful and is so up herself when she's literally just a teenager."
I really like the the episode in which they bring up a whole list of Jim's pranks against Dwight and he suddenly realises he might have gone a little far without meaning to.
"Right! I hate it when people try and pass him off as a 'sad tragic hero ;(' even though he's just a bully who abused his students for years. And not just Harry, almost everyone in Gryffindor and even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff. One good act does not make up for years of bad behaviour."
"Similarly, I went to go see a Floyd cover band (Brit Floyd btw--great show) and some fat old guys sitting in front of me were like ""What's your favorite song? Money?""

Yeah. I literally paid $80 to come hear Money."
"I relate to her but I totally see where you’re coming from. Bojack Horseman is all about shining uncomfortable spotlights on flaws people keep hidden. Diane shows the flaws of hypocrisy and conflict avoidance (and how these traits are toxic to those around them) in people who like to tout themselves as woke do-gooders. Also, she and Bojack have a lot in common though she’d hate to hear that. Just because she’s not drinking herself to death like he does doesn’t make her healthier."
Surprised no one has mentioned dark chocolate!
"Yep, I was Ms Judgey McJudge about people who've gotten ghosted. I'd always say ""Come on, there had to be signs! You ignored them! ""

Then I had a guy ghost me 2 days after he gave me a handwritten card with 5 paragraphs about how happy he is he met me and how the past 3 months he spent with me were the best 3 months he's had in the past 5 years. 

Of course it didn't even dawn on me that I'd been ghosted at first. . I literally thought he had DIED. I called hospitals. Because there is no way a man would go from talking to me every day for 3 months, including 2-3 dates per week, to not responding to my texts, calls, or emails unless he was dead, right? Right? 

Eventually I tracked him down, very much alive, and dating other people and he had the nerve to accuse ME of being a STALKER. Because he was too fucking spineless to send me 1 text saying ""I'm not responding to you because I don't want to date you anymore. Leave me alone."" 

And then, because karma is amazing, when I was in tears explaining this to people they would ask me ""Come on, there had to be signs!"" and I would say ""No, he literally wrote me a handwritten loveletter 2 days before he stopped responding to me. What kind of sign is that???"""
"In the beginning of the movie he loses that job for refusing to read the script as written. And Miranda states repeatedly that Daniel was often out of work, which would have been fine if he would do the housekeeping (since Miranda has a decent job) but he didn't do those things. He messed up the house, didn't cook, didn't clean, and didn't keep a job."
I really hate when the fist pic is a group photo and I instantly pick out the one I want it to be and it rarely ever is. 😕

I’d say I was kinda a mean girl from 11-14. I’m not sure what they could have done. Maybe talked to me more about why bullying is wrong. My mum said I went from this angel child to  a devil child at that age and she doesn’t know why lol. I guess hormones and  change of schools did it. I wanted to be cool and apparently back then it was cool to be mean to others
"Honestly it helps me to focus on what wasn’t good in the relationship and about the person. Knock them off of their pedestal.

"I go through my handbag every couple months to get rid of any useless stuff I've collected. 


What remains is always,
- Lip balm
- Tampon/pad
- Case for my specs 
- Pen
- Wallet
- 3-fold umbrella (it rains frequently where I live)
- Foldable grocery bag (to avoid the plastic bags at the supermarket)
- On cold days, I also like to put in a scarf."
"Absolute, instant deal-breaker for me. No discussion. I don’t want to share."

"I have a friend who gatekeeps battle vests. 

Any time we're around other punks with patches, she points out who irons/glues/whatever their patches to their clothes and criticizes people who do sew theirs on ""incorrectly"". 

Like, who fucking cares. It's their vest and they're expressing themself how they want. Not everybody has someone to teach them how to sew. Not everyone cares. 

She even picks at me because I use a sewing machine instead of hand sewing. I do a lot of studding, I save my fingers for that. I also cross stitch so I have a different outlet than she does. 

Just bothers the shit out of me and I've never actually vented about it before."
Oh man I am so sad to hear you had to go through child loss too.  It's better when we can support each other though.  It is the world's worst club but also the world's most caring.  Holding you and Tyler in the light.
"He's not married. I am, so....."
But when you wear less they think your sick or tired.
You or your SO get annoyed by everything the other one does.
"Yelled at me for half an hour for accidentally destroying a CD because ""destroying music is what fascists do. Do you want to be a fascist who destroys beauty and joy?""

Readers, it was a Shawn Colvin CD."
"The first time I saw SATC it was wonderful. The next time I saw it all at once irked and bored me so much. Carrie Bradshaw is so fake in her mannerisms and over-reacts to almost everything. Her hair covering her face when she is ashamed, she slipping down the stairs when Big tells her he is engaged, the “fight” she has with Aiden. All of it just screams FAKE. She questions her friend for not giving her money when she is in need, she lets aiden renovate the apartment when she knows she is not in love with him and let’s big come over to their getaway shack just so what she could be a good friend to the guy who broke her heart a million times? Annoyingly fake."
when I first started dating a guy we were looking up something on his Twitter app and he had the history of ‘sexy milfs’ or something in his search bar. I pretended I didn’t see but I was laying on his chest at the time and heard his heart beat sky rocket to a mile a minute lol.
"Nick in The Handmaid's tale. He knew that his affair with June and all the risks he took put her in danger. He knew that if someone discovered them the consequences for her would be dire. He was so careless, kissing and flirting out in the open where they could easily be caught. Not to mention that helping her escape put tons of other people's lives at risk. And for what? What makes June so special that everyone should risk their lives for her? Do the other handmaids not have children and families?"
"Mrs Doubtfire.  The ""hero"" of the movie. 

Is an actual terrible and neglectful spouse and father. Pushing all responsiblity on his wife. Who eventually and rightfully so gets a divorce and given that he is barely capable of caring for himself gets very limited and supervised visitation with his kids. 

So what does he do? Stalks his ex, sabotages her attempt to find a real child minder, then makes harassing phone calls so when Mrs Doubtfire calls she seems like an amazing gift from heaven. That's text abusive behaviour with a capital A. 

Then he creates an elaborate disguise and illusion to visit with the family and uses it to get information about what the family things about his real self and tries to engineer ways in which they take him back. 

Then the wife moves on finds a new boyfriend who by all reports seems like a real great guy, he wants to be in the kids lives, has the means to support them. Takes them on vacation. 

What does Mrs Doubtfire do? Vandalises his expensive car, hits him in the head with a hard fruit baseball pitcher style, generally demonises the guy, and to top it all off tries to posion him by adding stuff he is highly allergic to into his meal so he can ""save"" him later. 

But in the ends it's all okay and he is rewarded with a TV show."
I was using his phone once to look something up and I saw in his search bar “Walmart pigeon”
"It's such a weird assumption to me cos like, I expect most people grow up listening to/hearing the music their parents liked - partially because as a kid you might not have a defined taste in music yet. So like, of course kids can and will be exposed to music from the prior generation? It's weird to assume they had no access to it. Like, do these people not share their music with their kids?"
"We all know those questions are actually just ""What do you think of men who are *me*?"" anyways. 

Bonus points if they make the question vague enough to warrent a variety of responses and then argue. Ex. ""Would you date a guy who lives at home? ""Nah, id want someone independent."" ""But what if they were 6'2"", did their own laundry, and were named Steve??? Then what???"""
That’s really nice! On his Xbox you can put him as “offline” while you’re using it. It’s what I do :)
"Keep my anxieties about single parent life and money (no child support) from my 3 kids. NEVER talk disrespectfully about their dad. When they are asking me things about his life (e.g., why is dad getting married for a third time? He just met her 2 months ago!) I'll ask them for their opinion instead of giving mine ""Hm, I'm not sure. Why do you think your dad wants to get married?"""
"I never saw Alex as a bully, she was apathetic and sneaky but she had a good heart.

But I definitely agree with mean girls being portrayed as desirable. They were always the pretty popular ones that the “average” protagonists hated. In my case I wanted to be like Sharpay Evans xD"
"“Only” 48, but not having children was both a choice and not. I always wanted kids, just not with any yahoo, but someone I can rely on. That happend first ca 10 years ago. I got to know I would have issues with getting pregnant in my twenties, so it was not an surprise it didnt happend. Yes we could have tried IV or other, but for both of us ... Children are a gift, not a right. 

Do I regret it not getting pregnant earlier with one of my ex partners? No, absolutly not! We talked about adoption, but we are too old for that even. Though I think we will adopt maybe in the future an adult. There are many young adults with no family, we would love to provide it to someone."
Being a feminist
"There are so many people out there that someone (likely MULTIPLE someones) are going to be a good match for you.

I didn't think I'd never find a SO after my last relationship, but I thought I wouldn't find someone as compatible as him. I thought I would have to give up things I cared about to date someone. However, I was wrong and I figured that out pretty soon. 

I'm now dating someone just as compatible with me, if not more, and I feel so dumb thinking that I wouldn't find someone. In fact, I met him on a dating app, and I actually met multiple guys I probably would've been compatible with."
Baseboards alone are a ton of work!
"Literally nothing in his past could ever justify his treatment of Neville and Hermione, who are CHILDREN  and completely unconnected from his tortured asshole schtick. You’re dead on that his obsession with Lily was horrific, but even if you could somehow twist his stalker crush on her into some kind of romantic thing, nothing justifies being abusive to a child, especially one who lost his parents’ sanity to those very wizard Nazis!!"
Found the buzz feed writer.
"I just heavily and drunkenly spent 2 hours encouraging my boyfriends best friend to contact the girl he dated and had fallen in love with 3 years ago and was never able to get out of his mind. I made him promise to contact her before he left three nights ago and today he messaged ecstatic saying they’ve been talking and he’s so ridiculously happy and he told her his heart and feelings and she felt the same way the whole time and she’s coming to visit now. Point is, give it a try who knows what will happen :)"
This is like the 3rd comment about men just standing in the kitchen eating random condiments
"Same here. 5 years but it’s getting easier. He is just there at the back of my mind, like his voice, his opinions, what he would say. He also taught me a lot. We were really two people who complemented each other and grew so well together, so I still rely on many things I learnt from him. And things I achieved. I guess his voice will always stay in my head, you just getting used, like to some kind of an injury or disability and learn to live with it🤔"

"Seems like that panel should be women saying how to get a girlfriend, and men saying how to get a boyfriend.  Guessing any man talking about how to get a woman is as likely to be wrong as he is right, particularly among that crowd."
"I would say that yes Dany is hungry for the throne she’s not necessarily evil. She has compassion that Cersei lacks. Her good deeds in the first season shouldn’t go unnoticed. She is “the breaker of chains” after all. She has not really done anything ruthless that was not either deserved or known to the victim (I.e. the Tarly’s, they knew if they didn’t bend the knee they would die.) I would say this doesn’t make her an angel in any way, but nothing like her father or Cersei. Cersei has killed hundreds of innocents. Not to mention she’s not helping with the war vs the dead."
Lorelai too. I think that's what makes the show great. They aren't portrayed as great and they are called out in their bs.
A friend told me there is no way I actually understood the concepts of Chaotic/Neutral/Lawful Good and that I had *no right* to invoke those phrases to describe my hair dye colors because I hadn't played D&amp;D for the last 25 years.
"I felt strongly about my beliefs and he felt strongly about his and the theology didn't really go together. Luckily, though, we ended things mutually and respectfully before we got engaged or married."
"Thank you so much, this is really reassuring. My ex sucked, he was mean and selfish and hurt me intentionally in order to “win” arguments. 

I’m happy for you, I’m glad you found someone you deserve. How did you meet your current SO?"

"The elderly gentleman in Target when my daughter was 2 &amp; on the verge of a tantrum. My husband had been deployed for 3 months at that time, out of a 9 month deployment, and I didn't have much patience left before my own tantrum. He gently rested his hand on top of mine &amp; told me I was doing all the right things and to ignore the judgy looks from strangers. It was such a simple act of kindness &amp; empathy that was enough to put me back in the right headspace to console my daughter."
"&gt;the person with more of an air of authority/intelligence and the whole thing had nothing to do with gender.

Oh I love it when people say shit like this. ""Oh honey it has nothing to do with gender it's just [insert gendered stereotype]."" Sounds like you dodged a bullet with him."

"This is ridiculous too, because at this point I feel like legend of Zelda is pop culture enough that it’s not unheard of for any age range to know of it."
"This this this so much. My huge problem trying to leave my longest relationship of 6-7 years, was feeling like ending it would end all the happiness in my life. And it did, because I made my life revolve around a relationship that was circling the drain.
Please please please anyone for your own sake, make sure you have a full life outside your SO or work on your own life before you become involved with another person. Whether things are wonderful or whether they go south, your self esteem will be level and you’ll be able to handle any shaky times that come, which is inevitable in any relationship.
It’s a tad cliche but for real, do you and all things come into place."
"It was very difficult for me. When I moved, I got catcalled to and fro. It infuriated me but it wasn’t safe to tell the men to “eff off”. Once, I was walking down the street in a mini skirt and and an old woman came up behind me and tried to tug it down because she thought it was unladylike. When I ate in public, men used to yell at me that I was going to get fat. I was angry most days."
