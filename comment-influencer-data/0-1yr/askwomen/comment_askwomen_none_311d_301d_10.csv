"I lost my brother just after we met and we became good friends after that, with him being a huge support while I was grieving. Close to the year anniversary of my brother's death we had moved forward in our relationship and were living together by that time. I bought some milk from the grocery store and checked the date when I did it and, somewhat passively, noted that the expiration date was the anniversary of my brother's death and pretty much forgot about it. 

A few days later I went to put milk in my coffee and saw that the date on the milk had been scribbled out with sharpie. I immediately knew he had done it just so I wouldn't have to be reminded of that day. I remember bursting into tears and taking the carton into our bedroom, waking him up sobbing ""OH MY GOD DID YOU DO THIS? YOU ARE THE SWEETEST MOST THOUGHTFUL PERSON"" (it was a time of big emotions) to which he groggily replied ""Dammit, my goal was to prevent you from crying"" before promptly falling back asleep for another half hour.

It just made such a huge impression on me that he cared about all the little stuff. He had seen me go through so much grief already, any bit he could spare me was effort worth making, and the reality of having someone care so much about me was sweet and very overwhelming. "
"So, knowing what I do about the history of underthings (seriously, I'm not a mod for HistoricalCostuming for nothing)…

True women's lower-body undergarments (I will argue until  I run out of breath that Regency pantalettes don't count) really entered the Western scene as a direct reaction to the invention of the cage crinoline in 1857.  Cage crinolines, for those who don't know, are basically [skirts made of bands of metal held together with fabric tapes](http://www.koshka-the-cat.com/crinoline/hoop1.jpg) that made one's skirts poofy with significantly fewer petticoats.  Believe it or not, women of the era found them immensely liberating for that reason.  However, the fact that a skirt was essentially floating over a wire cage meant that [wardrobe malfunctions were a real risk in a sufficiently brisk wind](http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/lowres-picturecabinet.com/29/main/11/429515.jpg), and thus drawers were invented to somewhat conceal the legs if they happened to be revealed by the cage swinging around.

(It's worth noting that women's drawers until the 20th century were usually sewn without a seam running between the legs so that undergarments wouldn't have to be removed to perform normal bodily functions.  The function of drawers was *solely* to somewhat conceal the legs from view.)

The key word here, however, is *somewhat* concealed.  They were designed and made with the idea that they might be seen.  And that makes them interesting, something that one might steal a glance of, but something one would only get a full look at in a position of privacy.

Men's undergarments, however, have the distinction of being both completely mysterious and non-mysterious at the same time.  Women have historically done laundry for their male relatives and often still do today, so they handle men's underwear regularly in a non-sexual context.  Additionally, male wardrobe malfunctions don't tend to slightly reveal their undergarments.  There's no aspect of titillation involved.  There's no reason why men's undergarments indicate anything sexy or arousing.

Edit: I want to SUPER EMPHASIZE that this is only about the history of underwear of WESTERN women.  I honestly don't know enough about women in other parts of the world to comment on either their history or any underwear fetishes that might exist in their cultures."
"My husband sleeps like the dead and is very protective of his sleeping time. When we had been dating for 4ish months, I got a bad case of food poisoning. Couldn’t keep anything (even water) down for 3 days when he finally dragged me to a doctor. 

During that week long ordeal, my husband didn’t sleep. I would move a muscle in bed and he would be instantly awake. He bought every kind of anti nausea and anti diarrhea meds he could find and stocked my fridge with 5 different flavors of Gatorade. He kept my family and my work updated on how I was doing and didn’t leave me alone for more then 2 minutes until I finally started feeling better. I knew about day 2 of that miserable week that I’d marry him one day. "
I think it’s normal to think about people you used to be close to as long as you’re not telling yourself there’s a chance you’ll get back together or that things would be better if you hadn’t broke up. Keep reminding yourself why you broke up and fill your current life with meaning. 
"I live my life like a poorly managed Sim, so probably at most points in the movie."
"I just plainly don't do anything all day besides lie in bed and watch television. I need literally hours to motivate myself to do the simplest things like take a shower. All I eat all day is like a packet of crisps and plain ham slices because I can't get myself to cook something and even if I can manage to do that I know I couldn't manage to do the dishes so I don't even start. The night before I've made all this plans of my productive day. Like today I wanted to go to university in the morning and I wanted to go to the library and maybe look for some clothing. And then I don't do any of that, but I make the same plans tonight because surely the next day will be different. And then I make the same plans tomorrow night and so on and so on. But what I'm actually just doing is sit at home in my bed. "
When I let someone in on the road and they do the little hand wave as thanks. 
"About a month after we started dating when I realized he wasn't just laughing at my really terrible jokes just to make me feel good and genuinely thought I was hilarious. I believe it was right after my ""Two fish are in a tank. One looked at the other and said *you man the guns, I'll drive*"" joke."
"With a partner I want to agree on major life decisions, kids or not, where to live, how much time you want to spend together etc. For a friendship, things like that are a lot less important.

Something that's a lot more personal is that I need a partner to be someone who doesn't drain my energy (am introverted). "

"I was talking to a friend one night and we were both friends with my now husband. We were talking about the future and she said that her kids would refer to him as “Uncle John” and without even thinking about it, I felt like mine would call him Dad. It was a strange moment I realized I loved him more than just my best friend. Turns out he loved me for even longer. "
"We lived on different continents and I had less vacation days than him so when he came over to visit me, I still had to work.  He made me a packed lunch the first day while I was getting ready for work.  I didn’t ask him to, and I usually forgot to eat or skipped lunch.  My heart melted when he handed the bag to me as I walked out the door (he had even drawn a little bunny, his nickname for me, on the sandwich wrap).  

I grew up with not-very-engaged parents and was used to being very independent and fending for myself.  Food was always last on my priority list.  With him, food = love.  He continues feeding me delicious food (&amp;love) today, 15 years later."
"Idk but I think a man with boxer briefs looks sexy as fuck. Mostly if they are gray. You can see what he’s packing, check out that ass. Look at his legs. They’re sexy in my opinion "
"My friend told me “in a friendship I prioritise shared interests and in a relationship I prioritise shared values.” 

I think this is super important. I tend to become friends with people because we like doing similar things whether that’s camping or brass band. For relationships, I am more concerned about their social/political values then a casual friend. "
"""Damn gurl, you look good in that historical context"""
"Because I live by myself and don’t really see a point in cooking a shit-ton of food for one person, I usually get something delivered and then give the delivery driver a ridiculously large tip, usually in the range of $150-$200 depending on what I can afford that year. It blows that people have to work on thanksgiving and Christmas, may as well make someone’s day. "
"When SO is fast asleep, and he suddenly wraps his arm around me and pulls me closer."
"When I was 35, I was married, frustrated, and feeling helpless.  By 40, I was contemplating divorce, living overseas, and feeling terrified.  Now, with 50 on the horizon, I'm single (and so glad I am not in that relationship anymore), have a career for the first time, and feeling younger and more adventurous than I did 15 years ago.

You're never too late to make steps toward the life you want.  "
"My brother had a mental health crisis and can’t really work full time. My parents are able to help him out but I was on the phone with my mom and crying about how one day it’ll just be me (my brother is my only sibling). My brother will probably need to live in the same town as me if not with me. And my (now husband) didn’t hesitate. “Of course he’d live with us, no question, I wouldn’t expect anything else”. 
I knew he was the one to build a family with. "
"Technically I didn't even turn this guy down, which makes the story even more ridiculous.

So I met this guy at a bookstore, chatted for about 10 or 15 mins, and exchanged numbers. We set up a date but I came down with a cold the day before and texted him telling him I was sick and asking if we could reschedule. He suggested a particular day and I told him truthfully that I had plans with my family that day, and gave him a few other days that week when I would be free. Well, I guess to him this counted as a rejection because he flipped out and started telling me that ""I know you're trying to let me down easy, just say you don't want to go out with me."" Then sent me another text that said ""You just fucked up, bad."" At that point I stopped responding because it was clear that he was crazy. A few weeks went by and then he randomly called me one night, but I didn't answer and blocked him. 

I guess he thought me trying to reschedule was a rejection and lost it. I'd hate to see how he'd react if a girl actually flat out turned him down. "
When I allowed my ex to move in with me. I was so happy without him there and he was not good for me in any way. It took 2 miserable years for me to get away.
Someone who is your vigilant protector when you're at your most vulnerable. We all wish for someone like that. You two deserve all the best.

"My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Starting with their hilarious first meeting when Toula is pouring the coffee for Ian and his friend. Toula is socially awkward and has no idea how to behave around someone she is attracted to but she makes a joke about losing her train of thought and being a Greek statue and Ian laughs. This meeting spurs Toula to begin focusing more on herself and being independent by investing more in the way she looks and getting a job outside her parents' restaurant. After catching sight of her at her new job, Ian begins pursuing her but he's similarly awkward yet charming without being a total creep. He accepts her for who she is throughout the whole movie and when she admits that she was the weird waitress at the Greek restaurant this just makes him love her even more. He adapts to the family's customs and converts to their religion in order to marry her."

"We met in a chat room back in 2004. He private messaged me referencing something I’d said in the room. I made a joke that could have been just a comment and he not only picked up on it but threw something funnier back at me. I felt this weird connection, like we got each other. I typed out ‘I’m gonna marry you one day’ and then I deleted it, because I thought that’d probably freak him out. But really, a deep gut feeling.
I moved continents to be with him and we did a visa marriage in 09 followed by the marriage we wanted in front of family and close friends in 2013. We’ve got 3 kids and I’ll never love anyone else the way I love him. It was meant to be. "

"Pretty much within a few months of meeting him I knew I'd marry him. There wasn't anything specific. He was just the first guy I truly felt comfortable with and trusted. I couldn't get enough of him and wanted to wake up next to him everyday. 10 years on, we're expecting our first baby in a few months and I still feel a warm glow when I wake up and see him there"
"Japanese-American girl here. I met this one white guy on Tinder who was pretty cute in pictures, had a good face, seemed nerdy and relatable. The first time we met, I went to his place which was a 5 min walk from my apartment. We just chilled and talked and got to know each other, and I left after like an hour. It was fine, but he wasn't as cute in person.

The second time we met, he enticed me with a ""home-cooked dinner"". So I went over and he had made french onion soup in this bread bowl, baked, and also other stuff including dessert, and had put it all out on his public apartment patio area's picnic tables. It was super cringe so I said I wanted to eat in his apartment. We ate, chatted, etc. And I went home, knowing I wasn't into him anymore.

I messaged him on Tinder saying ""Thanks for the dinner and I enjoyed getting to know you, but I am not interested in seeing you again. Best wishes to you."" I always send something along those lines when I break things off with a guy I went on dates with, because I don't believe in ghosting, and I want to do for them, what I'd want communicated with me.

He responded to my message in like an instant with these huge long paragraphs about how I should give him another chance and that it's not fair to him that I'm cutting things off. I told him to ""please take my decision for what it is"", and that ""I will now unmatch on Tinder, best wishes"".

He proceeds to find me on Instagram and messages me paragraphs upon paragraphs about how he wants another chance and that right now he's really struggling to find his self-esteem after being rejected by another Asian girl (he had to mention she was Asian) and that he thinks it's unfair and all that stuff again. I blocked him on Instagram. I went ahead and stalked him on Facebook and blocked him there, too.

I saw him on campus a few times after, and he was always walking with a different Asian girl. PUKE!"

"Wow, this is like an r/AskHistorians level response!

Follow-up question: if their underwear was open to allow urination, how did they handle menstruation? I had assumed they would have stuffed absorptive material into their panties, but it sounds like they didn't have a place for that?"
TIL I have depression
I'm saving up to get a grill inside my house and a pool without railings in my backyard.
"So many moments made me love him but I knew he was The One when my big brother (who is incredibly shy, extremely slow to warm up to people, and generally keeps his opinion of people to himself) causally said “he’s good people. I hope he stays around a while.” May not seem like much, but that is huge praise and spoke volumes to me about the quality of my partner. "
"I know someone who works in a homeless shelter and she said they don't receive many donations for adult men (but more than enough for women and children). This year I'll be donating toiletries and gifts for men instead of toys. 

My boyfriend and I are going to adopt a family for Christmas. We'll be buying their food and gifts to my understanding.

I'm going to make a point to give positive feedback to management or corporate for retail employees.

Not a good feeling. However, I am trying to gain perspective on the few accomplishments I have been able to achieve - better late than never, right!"
"I think about my ex probably most days. We split up in 2005 and I've since got married to a great guy and had two amazing children. 

My ex was my teenage crush. I adored him. Obsessed about him. Chased him. And then eventually 'got' him. It was a relationship based on lies and manipulation but it lasted for nearly a decade during some very formative years for me.

My memories of him are really far removed from reality. Occasionally I see something in social media and see he's aged really badly, or remember something terrible he said to me. But mostly it's rose tinted specs. 

If I'm brutally honest my husband is a thousand times the man that my ex was. But sometimes weird memories can haunt you. I do my best to let these thoughts stay in my head and squash them 
"
When I quit my job without another one lined up... ooof.
"Good question!  The short version of the story is that for many cultures, we can't definitively say since women didn't write it down because a) menstruation was so commonplace they never thought they needed to and/or b) it was taboo to acknowledge in any context, but we know many Western women addressed the monthly problem by making fabric belts and pinning pads of some sort (probably made of fabric stuffed with something absorbent) to them, kind of like a temporary thong.  If you ask your grandmothers, they can probably tell you about sanitary belts, which were necessary to hold up early commercially-produced pads.

Weird tidbit, there are some records from the 18th century that seem to indicate that women wore old worn-out aprons backwards under their petticoats to handle menstrual fluid, but historians (both professional and amateur) are uncertain whether or not they passed the tails over the apron strings to form a kind of loincloth."

"Whenever I pass. It happens every time now, but every time I get called ma'am, every time people treat me as the woman I am is amazing. Yesterday was incredible - the nurse asked me about my menstrual cycle."
"On our first date which just so happened to be on Valentines day. There was a lot that happened but there were 2 moments where I knew this guy was something else. 

  
First moment was at a bar, ordered some drinks and he got up to go to the bathroom. While he was gone I decided to check out what was on imgur/reddit on my phone, came across this post of [Spongebob themed valentines day cards](http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/spongebob+valentines+day+cards_03a899_4413728.png) and started laughing out loud. He came back and asked what was so funny so without thinking I just handed him my phone to see. I immediately regretted this because I never met this guy before that day and all I could think was ""You frickin idiot, why did you do that?? He probably thinks your a weirdo that's obsessed  with Spongebob or worse he doesn't understand memes!"" Thankfully he started laughing at the pic and asked me ""Hey do you remember that Krusty Krab Training episode? That was the best one!""

&amp;#x200B;

The other moment was towards the end of that first date, we were stopped at an unusually long red light so he thought this was the perfect moment for a first kiss. Apparently in his head, he pictured himself leaning back into his  seat, with one hand on the wheel, [looking at me sexily like this](https://media.tenor.com/images/330d708897f29d8fc1bcdc6e927fbe83/tenor.gif) and saying to be in a deep voice ""You should let me give you a kiss."" BUT what really happened was he tensed up with both hands on the wheel at 10 &amp; 2, asked in a high pitched voice ""C-c-can...Can I kiss...you?"" with [this expression on his face.](https://media.giphy.com/media/yhRnl31SmMec/giphy.gif) I laughed so damn hard that he slammed his face into his hands from embarrassment. Of course I had to kiss him because it was so dorky and it was the best kiss I ever had. 

&amp;#x200B;

We're not married yet but we will be this Feb. 14 which is our 5 year anniversary :) "
"I have a bunny and when I feed her her salad in the morning she races back and forth in her pen until I get over then shoves her head in the food bowl and immediately digs out the carrot pieces to eat first.

"Before I met my husband I avoided conflict like the plague. About 3-4 months into our relationship we got into a huge fight, about what I don’t remember, and he suggested we go on a walk and talk it out. I didn’t want to talk, at all. I ended up speed-walking like 100 feet ahead of him because I didn’t want to talk it out. No one else I had dated before cared enough to talk about our issues or actually ask me why I felt the way I did so I always ran away, something I was attempting to do in that moment as well. My now husband states from behind me that all I am proving right now is that I can walk faster than him and to please come back and talk to him or just walk with him. 

He fought for us and I knew that he wasn’t going anywhere. That’s when I knew he was the one. 

EDIT: I appreciate all the wonderfully kind comments regarding this moment. He is my steadfast sweetheart who never gives up on us. I am so grateful he called me out on my speedy feet almost 8 years ago. "
"Thinking of that time my best friend (now husband) walked smack into a tree because we were trick-or-treating and he was wearing a costume that took away his peripheral vision and he was too busy staring at me. It was like a cartoon!!

&amp;#x200B;

Also the time he was caught changing clothes on an ""empty"" beach by a van full of old ladies. Gave them the best full frontal nudity an old woman could ask for!  He was so embarrassed, but they hooted and hollered as they passed so he shrugged and gave them a shimmy. (Our tents had been destroyed in a sudden storm and we were cleaning up the mess, but he needed dry clothes. There was NO ONE on the beach... till there was. I saw them coming and just let it happen. I still laugh like an idiot when I think of it.) 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess you could say my husband makes me stupidly happy. He's been my best friend since we were in 6th grade, and he's a total and complete dork, but he is amazing and I'm amazed I get to call him my husband and grow old with him. "
"I am at 35 and I felt more alive than I ever was in my 20's. That was mostly because I was in a shitty relationship until I woke up when I was 33.  In 2 years, I have started rock climbing and aerial silks, I have never been in much better shape, I am at the cusp of my career with a significant promotion in the horizon, started my own accounting firm with friends, restarted my forex trading (and getting investors), 1 goal short of traveling to all 7 wonders of the new world by the end of this year and in love with my current boyfriend.

What I still hope to accomplish are:
- buy a house (im hesitating because im not sure which state i want to settle)
- clear out all my credit cards (I still have a few left) but this is my goal for next year.
- maybe get married and settle down, we'll see!"
"I need to see my partner and be close to them. If I don't see a friend for a month because they were busy that doesn't change the friendship. When we see each other it feels the same. I can't do that with a partner and I could never have a long distance relationship. 

Besides that, a partner is in many ways a friend with benefits. Friendship can be super intense."
"Literally every time I put too much into a relationship (friends, S/Os) expecting them to do the same for me. I have the most unrealistic expectations and then I get disappointed and sad. "
I’m complimented on my word choice a lot. And my sense of humor.  Those types of compliments always make me feel elated.
"ruminating thoughts, binging on junk food, crying a lot, lashing out to family and friends, lots of spending too much money. 

i used to have it all the time. now it's only once in a while. it was a combo of meditation, antidepressants, and therapy.

"Partly because men don't tend to make sure they have sexy undies. Two exes ago I had a guy who bought all his undies at ""the gay store"" (as he called it) and I LOVED seeing him run around in his undies. They were all adorable. "
"On our first date. We went out for coffee, and we were both nervous. Met online and spent weeks talking before we went out. 

He was trying to drink, but spilled a little. I giggled, and our conversation went like this:

Him: “Oh sorry, I have a drinking problem”
Me: “Are you nervous? Is this your first time?”
Him: “No, I’ve been nervous lots of times”

For those who don’t know, this is in reference to the movie ‘Airplane’. Until him, I had never met anyone else who had seen the movie, let alone know it well enough to quote. After our exchange we both just looked at each other and knew. 

It’s sappy as hell, I know. But that was years ago and we’ve never had a doubt. "
Watching people older than me get older.
"I recently realized that while I'm super maternal in my friendships, I dont wish to be that in my romantic relationships. I'd like someone less in need of mothering, who is more independent. Not to say I'm against nurturing a partner, I will either way, but with it being a more full time relationship, I dont want to have to do so much so often, especially without reciprocation. 

Part of this is that I dont want to be running the relationship. My last partner, I made all our plans. It's tiring and doesnt make me feel like he ever wanted to do anything for me or plan to see me of his own accord."
"My grandma throws this huge party every year. We really are blessed with a good life and amazing giant family and she feels we need to share that. Shes somewhat of a celebrity in my hometown. Not in a like red carpet way but everywhere we go she knows everyone and they all consider her a friend. 

She finds people who don't have a family on Christmas, or who can't afford their kids presents, and she invites them to this party.

Shes had the same Santa impersonator for like 12 years. The guy is a professional. Amazing suit, GIANT sack of presents. And every year he has one for every single kid at the party despite there being more every year. That's because their parents give us a little bio on them and a week or so before Christmas my grandma and I go out shopping and buy them all presents. Nothing insane like iPads or something but if the kid likes science I get him some chemistry sets or if he likes cars I get him a hot wheels track and by the end of the day we spend probably a few hundred dollars.

Nothing in this world beats some little kid who recently lost a parent or isnt expecting a Christmas present, sadly looking at Santa then hearing their name get called. I'm a 22 year old man and I still cry like every Christmas because of how beautiful it is honestly. And Santa has this book we write down for him on every kid. Things they do well and things they need to work on and how proud their parents are of them.

I fucking love Christmas man."
"I think most movies where the two lovers are friends first tends to be a lot less weird and creepy, because the woman isn’t being “pursued”  in a typical kind of way, instead they just realize their feelings in a more gradual way. A movie I can think of specifically would be 13 Going on 30. It’s a fresh take because the main character is never really pursued outright at all, she just grows up enough to realize what she really wants out of a relationship. "
"My neighbors cat, Lucius. He says hi to me every time I get home from work. He throws himself on the ground, belly up, and tells me all about his day. Honestly, the only intimacy I need in my life and my boyfriend resents it. hah "
"I'm complimented on my speaking voice very frequently. I'm also told that I'm ""well-spoken"" very often but I'm not sure if it's because I'm a black woman who ""speaks white"" or if I'm truly well-spoken."
"I think that regardless of how a relationship ends; relationships are a part of who we become over time. we learn who we are through them. 

because of this, I think it’s okay to look back on old relationships and friendships, to occasionally wonder how that person is, and to think about how things might be if any circumstances were different. the time you spent with that person will always be a part of you, or at least who you used to be.

my first real relationship taught me so much about myself. it taught me that I actually had no idea what love was. I was so in love with the idea of being in love, i jumped into a relationship that I wasn’t ever really prepared for. I think without that relationship, my current relationship would have just been a disaster; as it taught me so much about myself; my irritations, my sensitivities, etc. and because of this, I appreciate the person I had my first relationship with so fucking much. 

I do find myself missing them &amp; that time in my life, but then I remind myself that that chapter in my life is over for a reason. I’m fortunate for the time we shared together, but they kept my heart safe until I found who my heart was supposed to be with."
"Sounds like you've got some Imposter Syndrome going on, which I relate to *hard* and it's super common. I know so many people who got their PhD later and honestly most of them are happier they did it that way.  And even if you feel like a kid at the adult's table do not lose sight of the fact that you are AT the table. You've got this &lt;3"
I literally can't remember the last time this happened.
"Almost from the moment we met. My previous relationships had all been slow burners, I knew the guy was interested in me so I went along with things but there was no real spark. With my husband, from the moment we met I was pretty blown away, we just clicked. On our second date he jokingly proposed to me and I said yes. We both fell in love hard and fast and it has 100% been worth it, he is truly amazing."
A month after we started dating I was in a serious  car accident and he helped me through everything. That's what made me realize I had found the person who's going to be there for me when I need it the most. That was 3 years ago and he is still the man that shows up when I need him the most.
"When I was like 14 and cut out that wart on my finger with nail scissors. But hey, that was very effective wart removal. Now it's gone and I just have a tiny scar. "
The first sip of coffee in the morning.
"I lost my son a few years ago and I have become much more compassionate and charitable since. During the holidays, I spend whatever I would have on him and donate it.  I also have this compulsion where I worry about him being cold, so I frequently find myself buying him a coat and donating it. Books is another big thing for me. I donate them-there is a school we had visited in the DR we were able to load up one year. Sometimes I just go to the library and randomly hide money in the kids books.  I try to help struggling college students in offbeat, but thoughtful ways (Hamilton tickets). Especially ones his age, red heads, Clemson students, etc....once my daughters are older I will probably devote myself full-time to some childrens charity or Mission. My motto is ""Everyone is Someone's Trey"". Just because the world is darker  without him, I can light a candle...."
"I am in the prime of my life. 

Why am I not also in the prime of my health?"
"Not finding the motivation to get out of bed. Surfing the web for hours despite nothing being interesting, because that's all I have for making time go by. Not wanting to make food because cooking and the dishes afterwards feel like an impossible task. Always being tired. Isolating myself despite feeling lonely as heck, because it feels too draining to try and seem like all is fine. Not doing anything at all and then crying late at night because I'm wasting my life. 

I usually try to just ride the bad days out somehow, and make up for them when the slightly better times come about. Taking walks while listening to music often makes me feel a little better. Small stuff like that."
"Lots of anxiety, very suddenly feeling drained, also wanting to sleep more than usual. I have found that anxiety and feeling drained are linked so when I feel that draining feeling coming on, I tell myself to ""relax"" and it really does help to ease that feeling."
Having the ‘we’ll deal with everything together ‘ attitude is very helpful in long term stable relationships.

"Definitely when I married my ex-husband. Such a horrible idea all-around, like so many reasons it was a stupid idea, and ended badly. "
"I've found myself to be a functional depressive. Still work and do whatever outside the house... but once I get home, I veg out in front of the TV in the living room,  or in my bedroom to sleep/listen to music. I'll just eat whatever I can buy or scrounge up in the kitchen. I will not work out, call anybody, and be akin to agoraphobia on my days off, in front of social media too. I've taken therapy to come out of those spells."

It's great finding that person who doesn't drain you but actively refreshes you in their company as an introvert. I just wish there was an easier way to identify those people.
"The erosion of my value. Not all women's value, just my own. My appearance was a cornerstone of my existence. I feel like an aging starlet clutching onto youth with white fingers. I haven't yet figured out how to let myself grow past that phase. And I don't know who I would be without that defining factor.

All of my fantasies of keeping a home or travel picture a young woman in the midst of them. I always picture myself in things, not seeing things through my eyes. It's going to be a brick wall when I no longer look like the person I define myself to be. "

"He brought me all the carbs...

I was a staunchly single independent woman, but we had been hooking up for about a week or so and I actually didn’t want him to leave, to my own surprise.

I had told him I didn’t have feelings, but I was glad we were friends and having fun hooking up. 

Well, he went home to NYC and I joked about missing the pizza and bagels (LA just ain’t the same). A week later he shows up on my doorstep with not one but TWO whole NY pizzas, and a bakers dozen of NY bagels, which he brought CARRY ON on the plane. We eloped a week later (with the intention to divorce, so we could call ourselves “divorcés” as a joke, but I told him I didn’t want to actually get a divorce).

We celebrated our first wedding anniversary six days ago; he is my rock and it’s going great!"

"Have you read the quote by Sylvia Plath about her life stretching out above her like a tree? Every opportunity and version of herself that she could be is represented by different figs, and there’s an abundance. But ultimately she can’t choose any of them because she is paralyzed by the fear that she is choosing incorrectly. And as she sits there anxiously thinking about who she wants to be, the fruits fall and rot around her, and the opportunities begin to vanish. 

That’s something I relate to a lot, more and more as I grow older. I think that feeling is what I hate the most. "

"So when my partner and I got together we were just 'hanging out' in what we both acknowledged was more than friends but not s relationship. 

(I had just left a long term thing and he had never had a relationship so we were both nervous) 

About two months in of 'not being in a relationship' I turned to him one day and said ""you know I'm your girlfriend don't you?"" And he said yeah, smiled and kissed me. 

So that was that "

"I just wanted to say thank you for this thread.

I turned 28 last weekend and kicked my boyfriend out two days later. Yesterday, he told me he was planning on proposing. No one's ever proposed to me and from him it would've been such a shock, such a surprise, and something I've always wanted. I want to settle down and have a family. 

He's not right for me, in fact he's a shitty person and I should've left a lot sooner, but it almost, almost made me think... maybe I should give it another try.

You ladies have reminded me I'm not running out of time, and it's not too late to start over."
My ex and I were best friends before deciding to date. We dated for a year on and off. We broke up because he became someone I truly hated. He was an alcoholic and an addict and I couldn’t be around him. He was also verbally and emotionally abusive and he’s gaslight me on a regular basis. We’ve tried to be friends but he’s constantly tweeting stuff about me. I blocke dhis personal account but he created a random account with no personal info and he followed me on there. I accepted the follow since I didn’t know it was him and he won’t tell me which account it is so I can’t block him. He also threatened to post my nudes online. Luckily I live in a state where revenge porn is illegal and he could face jail time if he does. Shitty situation overall.

"I bake as a hobby, which, if you're looking to win compliments, I recommend learning to do. My top three best compliments I have received are:

3) Me, at a party: ""Where are the rest of the cookies I brought? I swear I didn't put them all out.""

Host: ""Uh... well, so I kind of hid the rest of the cookies, hoping you'd not notice, and so I could have the rest later."" 

2) ""These are better than the madeleines I get in France."" (From a French person.) 

1) ""I want there to be a spigot in my house, and when I turn it these brownies to come out of it."" "
"We’d been dating maybe two months. I was scheduled to take the NCLEX (nursing license exam) a few hours away. He woke up before dawn, got an oil change he was overdue for so he felt he could safely drive the distance, and came to my house to pick me up. He drove me to my exam so I could study on the way there. He waited for me to take my test, then took me to a nearby retail outlet and was an enthusiastic shopping partner *for the rest of the day* before driving me home. 

It’s worth noting that day is also the day my *mother* decided he was the one. 

Been together 11 years, married for 6. "
"i never gave a second thought to men’s underwear until i met my fiancé. now i ask him to model for me any new pair he gets. to be fair it’s probably the man in the underwear rather than the underwear itself. man’s got the perfect ass. also i was never an ass lady til i met him.

bb, if you find this - damn boi you fine af. "
"I shove those feelings back down again and try very hard not to replay the memories. Most of all, I remind myself that there's a reason why I left him. I loved him, but that didn't change reality for us.

The truth is, I don't miss him - I miss our *incredible* sex life. We were combustible together. It feels as if I went from the epitome of cuisine to bland hospital food. "

"It took me a long time to figure out I had depression because I wasn't sad. People tend to think depression is only just extreme sadness and suicidal thoughts. 

I had neither. I was just hollow. Never sad, never happy, never angry. A human on autopilot.

"I like nice men’s underwear. A well-fitting boxer brief in a tasteful pattern is great. It seems to me that a lot of guys aren’t interested in wearing more than the bare minimum for underwear, and keep wearing them long past their due date. Stained, ripped and holey underwear isn’t sexy. Frankly, it pisses me off when a guy expects you to look like a Victoria’s Secret model but doesn’t put in the same effort for his partner. IME though a lot of guys don’t give a shit about what we are wearing at all underneath. They look at it for ten seconds and then just want to rip it off."
"My younger brother is autistic and hates strangers. He never even said one word to my ex husband. The first time I brought my current fiancé over to my parents house, my brother came and found me later to tell me how much he likes him, and asked if he could come over again sometime.

"We started out as friends but when things took a romantic turn, it was like lightning struck. Everything moved so quickly. We clicked on almost every level. We had similar goals, similar desires. We had a couple conversations about how fast we were moving and neither of us had second thoughts. About 4 weeks after we started dating, we took a 15 hr road trip to watch the space shuttle launch at night. That trip sealed it for me. We travel well together. Conversation flowed well, we are comfortable in silence, and most of all - I feel comfortable enough while he is driving that I can nap. That was it. I knew he was the one. We were married 8 months later and will celebrate our 11th anniversary in February. "

"They are going to have their own routine. They may not be as clean as you. they may not be as messy as you. When moving in with a significant other; the idea is not to change the person you are living with, but to compromise where you both need to in order for both of you live with each other.

Also everyone needs privacy. Try not to be up each other‘s ass. Trust me, no matter how much you love a person sometimes you just need to be by yourself.

I hate tho when my brain decides to dream about them, even though what happen with my other ex wasnt great, we still had a good relationship, the best thing i had for a real relationship, something i never had before neither after, so maybe my brain goes after that, but god how can people be so mean for someone who gave them everything, heart and soul, that they hurt so badly and didnt care anymore."

"Like some have said you should practice kindness all year round. I try to donate winter clothes during the holidays since in my state temperatures can get dangerously low. Toys for tots is also a great way to give back. I remember having nothing as a child during the holidays and it was always terrible. 

&amp;#x200B;

On that note, if you have a younger kid, I would highly recommend only giving them small gifts from Santa. Save the bigger gifts for their birthdays, or make them come directly from you. When you're a little kid who still believes in Santa, and who is told that you'll get presents if you're a good person, it really sucks to hear your friends talk about how they got a Playstation or a puppy or something super expensive from Santa.  It genuinely makes you think something is wrong with you, or that you were bad."
"Yeah, I want to make it clear, I have nothing against guys who are into Asian girls, because I have my own tastes too. I'm currently dating a guy who prefers Asian girls (I just know his most recent ex is Asian). Like, I get it, we're pretty awesome!

But the way this guy in my post repeatedly mentioned females' Asian-ness so often and his overall emotionally charged response to me rejecting him definitely put him in the ""creepy"" category."

"Cultural appropriation.

On one hand, when POC are upset, we should listen to them. They're upset about having their ethnically unique things used by white people, then popularized or monetized by white people, and often white people using up the opportunity to monetize whereas the POC might not have that opportunity.

On the other hand, restricting people to only use/do things they're familiar with, not letting them leave their box, seems harmful. There seems to be a lot of value in diversifying culture and making white people comfortable with other cultures. "
"I'm not black but am Asian with an Asian surname. When I was interviewing for jobs right out of college, I got told all the time I was ""so articulate"" or gosh, my English was ""really great."" Yeah, I grew up in the US. Of course my English is great. 

Sometimes I'm grateful for the low bar, other times I wonder what opportunities I missed out on because people assumed my English sucked. "
"I was told to get one in my 30’s. At that point I refused because I thought I was too young and that whole thing about doctors doing them for the money. I trusted my doctor - but still wasn’t having it. Thennnnnn when I was 42, I had suffered from terribly painful periods I finally relented. Wth was I waiting for?! I still have my ovaries so went through menopause naturally. But I have said many times that it was the very best thing I did. I’m not sure what I was thinking by refusing. That whole sentimental thing about my kids wasn’t one those things. 

I’m not telling you what to do one way or another. I’m just saying that it has been a great thing for me. 

If you decide to have it, give yourself time to heal. I went back to work after a week because I have a desk job. Not anything I’d recommend to anyone. Even if you have a desk job. "
"This is a great idea! I'm definitely going to see if any of the nursing homes around here would accept something like this!

I just called one place that's on my way home, and they said they would love something like this! Thank you so much for the idea! "
"The first time I spent the night over at his house, I woke up at four in the morning with indescribable pain. It was so bad I thought I was DYING. I woke him up and told him we needed to go to the hospital right now (until this point I had never gone to the emergency room, that’s how bad this was). He immediately went into action/protection mode and got me to the ER in record time. Turns out I had kidney stones. I felt so gross and disgusting sitting in a hospital gown, hair a mess etc. but he kept telling me how cute and beautiful I was. He took me back to his house and was so attentive in getting me back to health. After two more days the stones passed and I went back to my house. I told my friends that he was “100% husband material” - which they thought was weird seeing as we had only been casually dating for like a month. I was really serious about him after that. It’s been 7 years now and we got married last summer. Best thing I ever did. "
"As a former retail worker the one thing I stress to everyone this time of year is to just be extremely kind to every single retail worker you come across. The days are long, they pay isn't great, and the hours often cut into time with their families.

"I’m commenting so that I can ask my fiancé and get back to you with both our answers!

EDIT: My answer: I knew it when we were out bowling one night I think four or five months into the relationship. He’s killer and I suck, but I still had so much fun, and we were both on the same page with our life plans (certain amount of kids, religious/political beliefs, etc). I know it’s ridiculously early to say that but that night we were both drinking and I remember telling him I wanted to marry him eventually.

EDIT: Back with his two answers! First he thought I was asking when he fell in love with me, and that answer was during orchestra rehearsal in college (he was first chair clarinet, I was second chair), we were taking snapchats (which I still have saved) and joking around while the conductor worked with another section for like... 30 minutes. He says in that moment he knew he was in love with me because he'd never been so comfortable around someone and he knew he could be 100% himself, weirdness/silliness and all. Second answer for the actual question was he knew during our first New Year's together (3 months in) while he was on the receiving end of a Drunk Life Speech from my aunt's boyfriend. Something Drunk Uncle said just made sense to him (it was something along the lines of how happy Drunk Uncle was for us and that if you find true love you should always want to cling to it) and fiance said something along the lines of ""Even if I'm uncomfortable being around or with everyone else, I'm comfortable around you and that's what matters."" And also says that there were moments all along the way that reaffirmed it.

FINAL EDIT: We are watching Jeopardy and I correctly guessed the word ""demagogue"" for a thousand dollar question. He says this is his new moment."
Kind of the same thing but my sister pulled me aside to tell me that I’ve become a better person since my husband came into my life. It’s just one of the many reasons for me.
"Since I spent my first pregnancy alone although it was exciting...

I often fantasize about having a really beautiful loving pregnancy, going to scans together, laying in bed picking names, someone rubbing my belly and talking to it, having a partner hold my hand through the painful stuff and cry at the sight of their new kid. 

I know life isn’t a fairytale but a stupid romantic pregnancy is my #1 fantasy. I only want 1 more kids so let’s hope someone great comes along. "
"I was young and not ready for a relationship, so after I had went on a date with this guy that I had been good friends with for a while and it ended horribly, after a few weeks of making up my mind I told him I just wanted to be friends if he was willing, and I understood if he didn’t. He told me he would love to be my friend, and then turned around and treated me like shit, talked about me to others behind my back, accused me of self harm and other horrible things because of the music I listened to, and generally flipped shit. I couldn’t even look at his friends while passing in the hall without getting looks.

Literally, this guy completely changed himself. He lost weight, switched from Democrat to republican, changed his style, and started dating a bunch of girls. I felt horrible for hurting him so badly but I didnt/don’t regret my decision, especially so after seeing the outcome. Safe to say he didn’t handle rejection well"

"Quite a few things including the following:

* Gender/orientation is important in a romantic partnership, as I am attracted to women
* Shared future goals - i.e. someone who wants marriage and no kids
* Compatible attachment styles, which are not so critical in friendships
* Similar love languages, i.e. I need a partner who loves cuddles and quality time
* Shared beliefs and values - I like friends who share my values, but if there are some differences it's less of an issue with friends
* Responsible and manages their money well
* Someone I enjoy talking to and basically never get bored or tired of spending time with (that's not to say I don't need solitude and time with friends/hobbies, but if they bore me quickly I won't be dating them)

My standards for a partner are much higher and more specific than my standards for friends, basically. However, the closer the friend, the more important it is to me that they share my values and interests."

"Been there, done that. One of the worst mistakes I ever made...being unemployed with the threat of rent and bills looming over you is AWFUL! Granted, I don’t regret quitting my previous job because current one is much better, but I should have waited. Quitting randomly and then sitting around unemployed while desperately job searching is somewhere I never want to be again. "

"Pride and prejudice. The movies are ok but with the ""artistic license"" some directors like to put on their ""interpretation"" so YMMV. 

Definitely the book though. It has both the genuinely respectful angle you're looking for and the creepy misogynistic one and it shows the creepy misogynistic one to be completely uncool but accepted because of social conditioning/ pressure and how bad it is. "
"That is super generous of you! 

We should also remember that some people actually love the opportunity to work the holidays to earn time-and-a-half or double their usual hourly wage, depending on where you work and where you're from (or to earn big tips from people like yourself!) We tend to feel sorry for people 'having' to work over the holidays but not everyone celebrates or they just prefer the extra money anyway.

I personally enjoy working the days that most people tend to take off around Christmas. I don't earn any more money but my commute is *so* much quieter and way more bearable. Festive bliss! "
"I'm 19 and this is really inspiring. I'm happy, for you!"
"It was a slow feeling but I recall the moment where I was like”this is the perfect person for me” easily. We were backpacking through Yosemite. It was our first day and we had to reach a certain zone to set up camp. We’re from Michigan and not at all used to elevation so we basically hopped off the plane then climbed thousands of feet and I was really struggling. He was so incredible patient and just kept lightly (he knew I would’ve gotten angry with atta girls) encouraging me and it was one of the most reassuring feelings I have ever had. I couldn’t help but think... if this person could help me climb what felt like mountains, then what can’t we do together? 
That was when I knew!"
You betray God one time...Satan has feelings too
"This SAME situation. I was in my early 20's with an ex that I was absolutely horrible with but somehow thought that moving in together would make things easier. Nope, dumbest mistake I ever made. Most miserable years of my life.  I'm so glad you've also escaped that horrible situation."
"Not married (but I'd say yes if he asked). But I knew there was something amazing when he surprised me at work last year during the solar eclipse with my favorite coffee, and welding goggles, so we could watch it together. 
Also how well he takes care of me on my off days. I love him :) "

"i’m much more vulnerable with my SOs than i am with my friends.  i don’t expect or need reassurance or an ear or pats of the back from friends, partially because i don’t think i’m important enough to anybody (even though they’re important to me) to bother them with any of that stuff, whereas I know that my SO is definitely down for that bullshit and is happy to help me through it.

He ripped a big fart on our first date and we both started giggling. Oh and he made carbonara for me that night and has been feeding me ever since. Just celebrated 23rd anniversary in August.

"I have 2. One is completely hidden under clothing and the other is on the top of my thigh and partially visible when I wear shorts.

It's not questions or comments but on several occasions men have tried to lift up my shorts to try and see it. Like..  not asked... Just grabbed at my shorts to pull them up.

This is my life. 
It’s interesting though that the “exciting” male underwear is also aimed at the male gaze.

I'd like to be happy before I turn 40 and find some kind of purpose. I feel like I'm just going through the motions. "

"Sorry all! Went to bed right after I wrote this. 

So my husband and I were friends for a while, but I was in an abusive relationship for a little while and didn’t think I was worth loving. He was a light in my world and always made me feel good about myself and special somehow. Once I realized I loved him, I got the courage to get out of that relationship. Then a few weeks later I told him that I loved him, and he told me that he had loved me all of this time and well we have been together ever since. 

As far as the friend zone question.. I don’t really know how to answer that. He was just such a positive thing in my life, and he knew I was in a relationship so he respected that and was just the friend I needed for the time being. Sometimes friends are meant to stay that way. If you are in love with someone who doesn’t feel the same way back, it’s either going to take more time or it isn’t meant to be. There isn’t a magical solution I’m afraid. "
"Compatibility with my life goals. It doesn't really matter to me if a friend has different life goals but it definitely matters with a partner. Everything from what they want career wise, where they want to live, opinions on marriage, having kids, even having pets."
"Can I post here on my wife's behalf? She was in college and I drove 2 hours in a snow storm to see her. We got food, played pool and darts, watched Frozen, The Notebook and 1 other movie I cant remember. We had a great time but I had to leave at midnight because she went to a religious college and visitors cannot stay after 12am. So I went downstairs she walked me to the door, I hugged her and told her I had a lot of fun and that I should maybe come down next week. She said she would love that and said goodbye. Now I didnt know this until here bridesmaid said this during here speech at our wedding but apparently she ran upstairs right after I left, got to her room and told her friends ""I'm going to marry that boy"". We just got married in October of this year!"
one letter made that sound extremely painful !

I donate several cases of cat food to the shelter I adopted my cats from. I also donate several hampers of good food to various food banks. I research and pick a different charity to support each year and make a lump sum donation of $250 and then small monthly donations of $25. 
"Folks thought I was gay even when I had hair down to my hips. Gay friends have told me I have ""gaydar queering technology"" and give off a strong ""dyke vibe."" Short hair hasn't changed that, it just changed the tone of the street harassment I get. 

I grew up going to a Baptist school until 8th grade. ""Lesbian"" was a common insult, usually directed at the less popular girls who didn't flirt or have boyfriends or anyone openly crushing on them. It was an insult directly related to how (un)womanly you presented yourself and to what lengths you went (or didn't) to attract the male gaze. It used to really bother me, back when my sense of self worth and self esteem was largely based on how desirable to men I felt. And that's exactly what it's meant to do. 

Eventually I realized it says a lot more about the person throwing around ""dyke"" and ""lesbian"" as insults than it does about me, and if there's nothing wrong with *being* gay, why is there anything wrong with being *called* gay? People make assumptions, I gently correct them if it's relevant, and then kinda smirk a little inside at how much they fall all over themselves to apologize for mistaking me for a gay woman. I'm not offended. You  didn't hurt my feelings. But you did expose your assumptions -- and I hope that makes you think."
"He. An introvert who hates crowds and parties showed up to an art show I was in to see my work for the first time. I was so nervous. But when I saw him walk in the room disappeared. He handed me a drink and stood by me. He left briefly to go outside and when he came back in he walked up to me, moved my hair from my face and we locked eyes and I was dead in the water from that point on."

"This is the thing that gets me. A long relationship that ended on a clean, decisive note didn’t have nearly as much lingering confusion and anguish for me as the ensuing few short relationships that ended with no discussion or reason given. 

That lack of final closure is really tough for me to deal with and get past- as much as I tell myself that it doesn’t matter and I need to put it out of my mind and move on... I can’t help those little “what did I do wrong?” thoughts that float unbidden through my head at night. "
"It's heartwarming to read about all the good everyone is doing. 

If I could make one suggestion for people to consider this upcoming season: often the best donation is money. Many of your local shelters and charities know how to make a dollar stretch more effectively than you do. While cans of food, toiletries, etc. are great and I encourage you to give generously, perhaps consider a cash/gift card/cheque donation as well.

"I don’t know if this commenter is British but we generally call it the Great British Bake Off over here. It was popular when it was Mary Berry/Paul Hollywood/Mel &amp; Sue, but I think the consensus now is that Paul Hollywood is a bit of a pillock and the show isn’t the same since it moved from BBC 1 to Channel 4.

That being said, when it was really popular, you’re right, it was really popular. We had cakes in our office each week that related to each weekly theme.

Edited to remove a swear word which is so entrenched in the British vernacular that I completely forgot it would break the rules, sorry mods!"
"My take is that suppressing free speech will only allow their rhetoric to gain more traction because as moronic as it is, people tend to start  to sympathize with insane, hateful shit if it's coming from the ""underdogs."" Let them ridicule themselves by outing themselves as militant bigots, I figure. 

The line should be drawn at actual threats, but other than that, free speech should be permitted, though we shouldn't have to sit quietly and tolerate it because freedom of speech does not mean freedom from criticism."
"I mean it all depends on how you think about your ex really.

I think of them on occasion just out of curiosity as to where they ended up. And my ex I dated the longest I run into once a year but I think about him when something memorable comes up. But never in a “oh I miss him and want him back” kind of way. I also think about him out of concern here and there because I know his relationship with his parents is bad.

If I was thinking about ex’s in a romantic sense I’d think it would just me be remembering the highlight reel and wanting that experience again, not that person. "

"Man here: I think a lot of men have no idea what women find sexy beyond that rugged, manly serious look, and are afraid that trying something out of the norm will just lead to whoever they're trying to impress dissolving into laughter.

"I have issues with the concept but I understand why people get mad about it. I’ll give you an example. I’m a black woman and I live in the south. If I wore cornrows, braids, or dreads, many jobs would NOT hire me. For years, people thought that those hairstyles look ugly. People made fun of me in school for wearing braids.

 Now, they’re cool and some white celebs wear it, I don’t mind, but excluding the dreads, I’ve never really heard people say, “Oh that looks horrible on them” or “They didn’t get the job because they don’t look “presentable”” The societal response seems better when it’s a white persons compared to a black person. This is kind of why Native Americans may get mad about the headdress. Hopefully my explanation helped. "
"I love this. All my moments were ""little tells"" too. When I started dating my now-husband, it was just... easy. All the things I thought would be hurdles or issues about me, were either neutral or positives. We do put effort and care into our marriage, but at its core, it's just, well, easy. "
"I work in IT. We're stuck in the basement and rarely leave, so the dress code is basically ""Don't be naked."" It's the most casual of business casual down here, with the expectation that if you're going to meet with someone outside of IT that you'll spiff yourself up a little.

I generally wear maxi skirts and a plain top or leggings and a tunic. Sometimes a dress. Today I'm wearing a pencil skirt and a squishy sweater because it's getting chilly. I long ago discovered that if I wear a skirt I automatically look a million times more dressed up, even though maxi skirts are basically PJs that I'm allowed to wear to work."

"I used to pay off as many layaway accounts as I could afford at Toys R Us, starting with ones that were going to expire soon. This year I'm torn; the only store that does layaway around me is Walmart, and I don't like supporting them at all, but I hate the idea of parents trying to make the holidays nice for their kids and not being able to make it work. 

I try to host more dinner parties because nothing says the holidays like feeding people I care about. I also love making cookies which I give away because I I enjoy making them more than eating them."
"I try to focus on other things. The knot in the pit of my stomach gets smaller day by day.  The hurt dulls, the bitterness  fades. I try to be honest with those I date about the existence of a lingering pain, but I try my best not to let it have a voice beyond that.

Some breakups take a long time to get over. In my experience the healing can't be rushed. Interim dating can help, but it often feels like peeing in your pants to stay warm; it's temporary and leaves you feeling icky and uncomfortable after.

Keep busy, enjoy your friends and family, travel. Read, write. Appreciate the little things.  Eventually things will get better.

"God, The Big Sick was absolutely heart-wrenching at times. Spoiler: &gt;!He experienced so much of a relationship with her, did so much for her and her family while she was out, and grew so close to them. He experienced a closeness to her. And when she woke up she had experienced none of that closeness. And he's like, well I lived these months of taking care of you and bonding with your family, this experience, this closeness means so much to me...and it's just not there on the other side. It's not his fault. It's not her fault. It's a supremely uneven situation of intimacy. That would fuck with my head so much.!&lt;

"Thank you for actively acknowledging retail employees at Christmas! It's the most stressful time of year for us by far and there's so many new staff and the hours get more ridiculous and complaints are aplenty. A ""this employee did a great job"" goes really far.

"I'd guess that it's because men have no vaginal discharge, so they just smell like dirty laundry.

But now that I'm thinking about it longer, if this was the main reason, there'd probably still be an equally sized market for cum rags as there is for soiled panties. And there isn't. 

So it probably all boils down to women's bodies and by extension bodily fluids being a subject of sexualization more than men's?"

"I went through each and every answer and barring a few, almost all responses had nothing to do with things money can buy. And those that were, were small token amounts like someone buying flowers or a gift. No one said I feel happy looking at my brand new BMW or the number of zeros in my bank account, or upgrading my kitchen!

Amazing how we run after material things that don’t matter in the big picture. 

Adding my answer: I make sure every night I go into my kids room and kiss them while they sleep. That’s my one private moment where even they are not aware of how happy and satisfied I feel at that moment."

Not only is it nice to have space if someone needs to crash but when one person is wanting to play videogames with the volume up and the other person wants to read or study or whatever . It is nice to have another room you can go to without it being the bedroom. I dunno my SO and I are both introverts. He said a one bedroom, I was certain way needed a two bedroom. He agrees we made a good call. 

Edit - to add on top of this I am a kicker in bed when I am stressed. So it is better for me to go into the other room because SO goes to work super early. "

He was always the first person I'd been with who hadn't tried to change who I was, and found everything that people found annoying, just endearing. 
And for someone who suffers from terrible anxiety that flares up, he'd make the effort to be present, to talk me through it, to count my breaths and to slow my breathing pace. 

He's been the one person who's made me embrace the dips along with the highs, and helping me realise I don't need to fear them, just embrace them and work through them.

We better each other every day with each others support and I honestly cannot see myself with anyone else, and if he doesn't ask me when the time is right, I'll ask him myself. "

"&gt; Friendship can be super intense.

I’ve seen that many people have these “intense” friendships that seem to have the same amount of energy put into them as with a romantic relationship. I have found that I just can not do that, especially while having a romantic partner. I feel exhausted just thinking about it.  The shitty part is that I end up being that friend that disappears when they are in a long term relationship. I only have enough love juice in my emotional gas tank for 1-2 people (in terms of daily interaction).  Add more people and I just end up drained and wanting to hide out for a couple of weeks/wanting to escape and do things by myself.   

I feel like this might have something to do with being raised as an only child...I’m used to the peace and quiet and the *not having to juggle 800 social interactions a day with siblings/a big family*...

"I always felt like I had more of a “functional depression”, if that’s a thing. I still went to work, but it was rough getting up in the morning. Rough getting dressed. Rough at lunch because I didn’t pack anything and I didn’t feel like going out to get something. Getting home and just isolating. Some booze to take the edge off (not proud of that, just a fact). Watching TV until I pass out and wake up to do it all again. Often crying at some point after getting home. I got out of it by just keeping going. It’s hard, but I just kept going knowing at some point I’d find some normalcy. "

I hope to clear off my debt this year, go somewhere warm, level up to a bigger apartment.  My dream is to find someone to build a life with but I’m losing hope.

"There definitely wasn’t one single moment for me. I knew from our first date that this was going to be something special. We were (and still are) inseparable after that night. Not to mention, I was in college and still living at home with my strict dad. I had ridiculous curfews, rules, etc, but he came over every single night to hang out with me because I wasn’t really allowed to leave the house much. He was out of college with a grown-up job and could’ve easily peaced out. That meant a lot to me. 

Also, we went through a rough patch because he was coming to terms with a mental illness, and shit was not easy for us. Our relationship was pretty toxic at that time honestly. There was one night when I started questioning if I really wanted to do this. I didn’t HAVE to stay, I was hurting, he was hurting, so why was I?? Then it just kinda hit me that nothing could make me leave because I love him and I’d rather endure rocky times than ever be without him.

I can do those activities with my friends, but I can't build a life with them over shared interest in kayaking."
"Honestly I'm not bothered by men just being on the street next to me lol...they have to do something to make me UNcomfortable, not the other way around.  So, DON'T...

* Suddenly accelerate to get closer to me
* Start breathing heavily/weirdly and murmuring things to oneself 
* Stare at me or make long direct eye contact
* Try to bother me unless they're asking for directions or actually need help.

Sometimes I'll notice a guy will speed up and actually get AHEAD of me so I don't have to worry about him following me. That's appreciated, but defintiely not necessary."

I’m in the UK so voted absentee. What was the atmosphere like at your polling station? The Atlanta subreddit has lots of reports of long lines - how was it for you?

"Came here to say this!

My husband and I have been together since we were 14 and I have been pretty much BEGGING him this whole time to start wearing boxer briefs.

It's been 10 years and he just bought his first pack and I am LOVING IT. He said they are super comfortable, which is a plus. All I care about is that ass, though. 😍😍😍😍"

"My high school was super artsy and we didn't really have typical Mean Girls, but rather various types of pretentious artsy kids, so a few highlights:

* All the girls in my a capella group secretly being gay and not wanting me to know (I would have been fine with it, btw) I wound up being really annoyed at them bc I felt left out, not because I was a homophobe, but I think they took it that way.
* Every year a new wave of girls claimed to be Wiccan, only to abandon it the year after (one-year bisexuality was also optional.)  To be clear, my best friend is bisexual and it's a very valid identity but in my high school it was like an occasional thing that every girl would claim to be for like 2 months.  Made-up mental illnesses were also popular.  One girl claimed to be a cutter but it was debunked when we realized she was using stage blood in her photos.
* One girl circulating a really pretentious stupid short story about how she wanted her dead body to be scattered at a mall where ""materialistic Americans"" would be forced to see it
* Someone spreading a rumor that George W Bush was going to start drafting 16 year olds including in Canada (???)
* Foreign exchange student stole like 50 cell phones, was expelled and sent back to his home country where he got shot by police and killed...that escalated quickly."

"No worries! It’s a good question. Midwives tend to specialize in low risk, “normal” prenatal care/deliveries. We also specialize in well-women care (GYN care). We are trained in higher risk management as well, but it’s not our focus. We also do not do surgeries like C Sections, though we are often trained to do surgical assist. We can do some more minor procedures like colposcopy and IUD insertions. "
"To elaborate: they would successfully impeach him, (impeachment is just a fancy word for ""accusation,"" and only requires a simple majority vote in the House) but a conviction requires a 2/3 majority in the Senate, which will never happen, barring something that causes Republicans to flip en masse. And given what they've managed to excuse so far, that's unlikely."
How do the fish steer  or man the guns without arm-ies?
"Ugh. Reading everyone’s comments made me realize that I do not really share that realization with my SO. He has never proposed (I don’t plan on asking him) and just assumes we’ll marry bc we have kids. We did have a connection when it was just us but he lured me in under false pretenses and now I’m looking for a way out. Kinda hard to initiate when he made me quit my job bc watching the kids was too much for him with his full time work from home gig. Is there a do over at life?

Edit: man this blew up. I appreciate the support to live a more fulfilled life! I’ve been working on communicating my needs and desires with him since pulling myself out of the rut when I posted my original comment. We struggle and sometimes we hit a new low but we do our best to help each other out. Besides, we need to show our kids how much work it is to work together. "
My parents groomed me to think abuse was love lmao 
"Same life goals. Neither of us should have to make big sacrifices. It matters if a partner wants kids but not if a friend wants kids for example.


With friends you meet as often as you want, which could be once every few months or several times a week. A partner I'll eventually move in with and see everyday, and it's important that I don't get tired of them and we don't run out of things to talk about.


It should be almost completely positive. There are friendships that are more draining than giving (I need better friends lol) but it's harder to keep a distance from a partner's negativity than a friend's.


Similar values. My views are important to me and I couldn't be with someone who doesn't stand for the same things I do. It doesn't matter as much what my friends believe as long as we treat each other with respect.

"Two thoughts: 

Some cultures are super prudish about nudity in general and that’s rather sad. I think the human body is nothing to cover up or be ashamed of.

That said, the overt sexualization of children is highly problematic. It’s one thing to have a kid run around in a two piece bathing suit. It’s an entirely different thing to put bra cup padding in kids bathing suit tops to give them the illusion of breasts."
"Send out messages to people about happy random memories of them. Or send them messages just saying you’re thinking of them.

"My family has a super rustic little cabin (no electricity -- only propane lights and appliances etc.) on a beautiful little lake about 2.5 hours from where I live. We can't drive to it, we have to park across the lake and walk or boat to the cabin. Without fail, every time I walk down the hill from the car and look out over the lake I get so happy!

Also, pasta. Always pasta."
"The way he selflessly took care of me. I came from nothing. He was living good! Great job. Had money, a car, everything. Me? I had nothing, A bad job. No car. Poor living conditions. And i was mentally broken.. he picked me up dusted me off and gave me a whole new life. and never asked for anything in return. He loved me through my pain.. he saw a me i didn’t even see. "

"When my mom told me, 23, pregnant, and engaged to a Narc - ""you do not have to marry that man, you can stay right here with us and everything will be just fine"" and I told her I couldn't possibly do that, that I had to go to [far off place] with him. Fast forward several years, two more kids, more tears and bruises than I ever thought could accumulate in that span, and she's the one I call to help me get the fuck out. "
"every person I fell in love with.

"I worked with my now husband on a project. It was long hours with some downtime while we waited for data to compile and we laughed and talked the whole time.

At the end of the project, one of the other people in the department said ""after all that time together, I bet it will be really weird for you to not spend every day with xx."" I burst into tears. Love had totally snuck up on me, and it hit me like a ton of bricks in that single moment.

The assignment ended, and the next day he called and asked me out, explaining that he didn't want to make his feelings known until we were no longer working together. 

We've been married 25 years this month. :)"

"Every year I volunteer to feed the hungry, needy, and lonely at Thanksgiving with my dad. Tbh every year we get so many volunteers that there are usually more volunteers than people who eat at a time. But it’s a good time. I’m glad it’s there for people who need it. "
In all my years I’ve never found someone like that. The only person who refreshes me is me. 
"I don't know if this is misogynistic, but im an engineer, when we informed some of the outside sales guys ""we hired a new engineer, she starts in 2 weeks"" most of them just asked me ""is she hot?""

"I don't wear makeup because I don't like the feeling of it all over my face.

I also touch and rub my face a lot during the day so it would be ruined pretty quickly.

But I just have had no interest in using it, I guess when I grew up in the 80's, there wasn't the expectation that young women would have flawless makeup.  Social media &amp; the influencers just didn't exist.  

I grew up with make up as an option, not an expectation."
you're a goddamn inspiration! I also started rock climbing this year (I'm 29) and it's such a fun challenge every time! Owning my own business (film production and/or advertising) is definitely something I want to achieve within the next decade. Any advice? 
"My life right now. I am aware of feeling like I'm an empty shell living day to day just to get it over with. When I do go to work, my anxiety gets worked up and I just avoid talking to people. Sometimes my coworkers make little comments that can make me feel bad about myself and I end up trying really hard not to get emotional and cry. Like earlier today, my coworker just made me feel like shit and put me on the spot in front of like 15 other coworkers. Now I just want to go home and drink until I forget how I feel."
"The most annoying one currently is basically just “what do they mean?” They’re tattoos. They don’t have to mean anything. They can just be art. If they did have a deep meaning of some kind, I wouldn’t always want to talk about that with a relative stranger. 

Years ago, when I had short hair and a text tattoo on my neck in a language that isn’t common in my area (don’t worry, it’s not Chinese characters I can’t read), I got asked *constantly* what it said. By total strangers. I’d be at the damn grocery store and I’d feel hands on the back of my collar trying to tug it down to read the rest, and then they’d ask what it said. 

It drove me fucking insane and ruined the tattoo for me in a matter of days. It was “so meaningful for me” until I had to explain it to random people ten times a day. That’s fine, it was a young mistake and garbage anyway, but I’m glad my hair covers it now. Eventually I might get a full back piece cover up. "
"If i find myself wanting to spend more time with that person right after i leave i find its time to be slightly more serious. Im an introvert hardcore but i bond quickly to people i click with. I had known my boyfriend a week when i decided i wanted to date him, i met him over tinder and he had an incredible personality and made me feel so good we off an on spent that whole week together, including me staying at his apartment and spending like 40 straight hours with him. I think it has a lot to do with a gut feeling :)"
"&gt; In 1845, the United States was largely an agrarian society. Farmers often needed a full day to travel by horse-drawn vehicles to the county seat to vote. Tuesday was established as election day because it did not interfere with the Biblical Sabbath or with market day, which was on Wednesday in many towns.

So basically because they didn't want farmers driving buggies on the sabbath.  But now? Tradition."
"Daily! Largely related to parenting.

My husband thanks me for managing our household and raising our child daily, he compliments the food every time I cook. I sometimes get praised by strangers for good healing in OW or for a great POTG. Occasionally my toddler stops to tell me something is fun. I see that as a compliment for whatever activity I've organized or my ability to take direction."

1. If I like the voice acting better
2. If I want to romance the gay dude (looking at you, dorian)
3. If I'm replaying the game and want to switch it up.

Sometimes i also just kinda feel like playing a guy, but I definitely have a strong preference to play women. However, it's not in the ""ew playing a guy would be so weird"" kinda way. "

"Voluntary Euthanasia.

I hate how the whole debate is conducted from both sides. I don't think the majority of doctors are evil butchers who push dying on patients for economic reasons. I also think that most people who want to completely legalize it often use ""cancer models"" (young beautiful people who die publicly on instagram), romanticizing the issue while knowing very well that this image does not reflect the actual complexity and the majority of cases.

If you're catholic (as I am) and you think you're supposed to hold it out till the very end, you should be not disturbed in doing so, but you also, in my opinion, should not push that choice on other people, completely ruling out any form of assisted suicide. I see a need for regulation as to protect life, but I also know from experience that every regulation in practice prolongs suffering in those who wish to end their lifes. So yeah, I don't know what to think about this. (also I don't know the current legislation in the US, so I'm speaking from a German background.)"

"Tried voting this morning in Charleston, SC in a poor part of town that's steadily being gentrified. They had 7 machines, 2 were ""broken"" by 10am. After an hour and a half, I was almost inside when senior citizens were allowed first access to the polls for the second time this morning. I had to abandon, my wait would have been another 45 minutes and I was already a half hour late for work.

Is that policy of allowing seniors to vote first standard policy? They were not disabled, there was curbside voting for that."

The breaking up part and defending her isn’t relative to me staying. I just had to point out how fkg crazy she is and fkg delusional he is. "

"Sometimes I get a box of candy canes from the store and just carry them around in my backpack, just in my water bottle holder. I usually give them to random people. I like having them visible because then they're easily accessible and kids will smile and point at them on the train, so I can give them one.

My mom always ""adopts"" a family where we buy their whole wishlist through an organization, but I don't really feel like it is as selfless because I love shopping lol."
"We're currently married/not married, as in we've filled out the paperwork so technically we are but we haven't had our wedding yet (planned for January) so we don't consider ourselves to be actually married yet.

To me I realized that I wanted to marry her after she opened herself up to me entirely to help me while I was dealing with a spike in depression and suicidal thoughts that landed me in the hospital and in therapy, and later how she was willing to be disowned and abandoned by her parents just to publicly be in a relationship with me. Just seeing what she was willing to sacrifice to be with me, how much she wanted to help me get better. It all made me fall more in love with her than I already was."
"The obvious one: don't have sex without contraception unless you mean to become pregnant. Don't rely on 'safe' days, him pulling out, 'I've got away with it so far, I must be sterile!' and so on. 

You are a young healthy woman and your body WANTS to be pregnant! Thwart it! "
"If you want an unbiased perspective I suggest looking at 538. Imo they're the best when it comes to election coverage, exploring who's going to win and why. Though if you want more detailed coverage on any particular race you may need to go elsewhere, as they're more focused on large trends."
"I learned so much from your responses, thank you"
"To be fair, I'm very attentive to movement if I think the person next to me is about to shit the bed."
"To be fair, the 538 analysis said she had a 2 out of 3 chance of winning, and they explained that it would only take a small error in the polls to give Trump a better chance of winning than Hillary.

A lot of people saw other sites say things like Hillary had a 98% chance of winning, or mistook 538’s 2-in-3 chance for a certainty, but if you listen to their podcast and read their articles, they’ve always been clear that it meant: “if you run a simulation of the election through our model a bunch of times, Hillary will win in 2/3 of those simulations and Trump will win in 1/3 of them.”

I think a lot of people really wanted the reassurance that Hillary would win, and the media narrative during the general election was almost always that Hillary was a sure thing, even when it played up the drama of the polls tightening."
"A conversation with a ""friend"" in high school stands out for me. I grew up in a very poor neighborhood. In high school I was on the honor roll and valedictorian. I had a ""friend"" tell me that she was shocked to learn I live in xyz neighborhood and just couldn't believe it because I carry myself ""so well."" Even asked me multiple times if I was joking because I didn't ""look like I grew up there."" Still angers me to this day to think about it lol. Like thanks for the compliment, but I'm not embarrassed of where I came from and shouldn't be made to either.

edit: spelling"
"I was waiting for the trolley once, and an older gentleman approached me.  


""Excuse me miss, I don't want to sound like a pig or come off as a creep, but I just have to say, you make that very unattractive dress look very beautiful. You have a nice night now!""  


And then he walked away. On one hand, I have shit taste in fashion, but on the other, it's one of those ""you could make a potato sack look good"" scenarios. Most respectful yet strange backhanded compliment I've ever received. "
"Ditto, ruined my entire life till about 48, the lightbulb went on &amp; I started reading up on codependency - has completely changed the person I am... I have one true friend now &amp; that’s ok!  I’m happier than I’ve ever been, single &amp; just being the new me - 3 yrs, it’s great!"

I've been told I have a very feminine face and body? It didn't really concern me though because I wouldn't be offended if someone assumed I was a lesbian. 

I did get hit on by men less, but I got way more compliments from women. I've grown my hair out now and I miss that!

A couple assholes have told me short hair was unattractive on women in general, which I thought was super rude. Clearly I have short hair so why would I care about your opinion, random man. "

"Sex work, but *very specifically* how we should handle it legally.

I do believe that an adult, being sound of mind, should be able to freely agree to participate in a sex act with another adult of sound mind for an agreed-upon price.

*However*, the way the industry works means that a lot of time this doesn't happen.  While some sex workers are making an informed choice to pursue the career, many others (if not *most* others) do sex work because they're literally enslaved to do so, they're being coerced to do so, they're utterly desperate and don't see any other way to make money, etc.  I don't see a way to protect both groups of people."

"My therapist and I just talked about this last week, so this seems a particularly apt question for me to reflect on.

Essentially, subconsciously picking men with similar traits or red flags to the men my mother dated in hopes of a different/alternate ending happening.  The amount of times she picked the wrong people, hoping they would grow to love her SO MUCH that they chose to become better for her and love her the way she wanted to be loved was astronomical.  My whole childhood was a constant swinging door of new guys disappointing her and her reluctantly admitting they were never going to ""aspire to be better"" and always just be bad.  (And I don't mean that just in a way that was bad for her, one was legitimately a damn convicted felon).

As an teenager and an adult, I fell into the same traps.  I'd see red flags and think, ""I can iron that out"" or ""They know that's bad, but they're only doing it because they care more about themselves than for me right now.  But one day, they'll care more about my feelings and respecting me than their selfish desires.""

Nah, Past Rivlet.  Naaaaah.

Basically, perpetual optimism and a desire for a fairy tale love/devotion coupled with poor self esteem, the belief that I really could make someone love me so much they'd  consider me in their decisions/desires, and just dumb optimism.

I said optimism twice.  Because optimism was a huge part of it."
"I don't think I ever had a ""moment"", exactly.

"Out with my husband, then bf. We had been seeing each other for two months. Long story short we went out for sushi, then to shop. The sushi was bad and I had to make an emergency run for the washroom and left my husband standing in a shopping line and a tech store. Not only did he pay for my things in line. He texted me 100% serious asking if he should buy me a pair of pants and what washroom I was in. This man literally thought I crapped my pants, wasn't leaving my side and was trying to solve my problem. Deal done! "

All of that takes place within the executive branch.  But the House can reopen it's own probe. 
"That’s correct; that’s why Democrats aren’t running on a platform of impeachment. Instead, they’re running for a platform of investigation, where investigative committees are free to do their job (which may mean more indictments among Trump’s staff).

"&gt;I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet."

"32 and not the greatest, but not bad either. On a huge upswing:

* Got married at 30 just as I suffered complex injury to my knee in a hiking accident.
* Surgery recovery made me rethink my life, realized I was pretending to be a man to keep everyone around me happy while I was silently dying inside. So I embarked upon my gender transition.
* Divorced and in debt because of my transition, suffered awful depression from that fallout.
* Somewhere mid-31, decided I was done being depressed and made life changes to be happy and get out of debt.
* Quit drinking alcohol and smoking, my body feels amazing and I am getting huge compliments because I am starting to finally get slender now that bloating is a non-issue.
* Working out 4 days a week, eating healthy, and taking my mental health deathly serious.
* Paying down my debt without panic attacks.
* Own my own business that is chugging along, on the board for multiple nonprofits, recently got tapped to take a very visible position on the licensing board for my profession.
* Finally feel like I am using my law degree for the reasons that led me to the profession. Even been in the media a couple times for my advocacy work in the trans community.
* My family finally accepts me for me.
* Replacing all of my lost friends with new, more genuine connections.
* Starting to step back into dating slowly, but am in no rush this time.

Basically, at 32, life is still hard but I feel like I am becoming the best version of myself at a break-neck pace. I haven’t felt this way since I was 21, just before I first tried to transition and was met with abuse, blackmail, exploitation, possible homelessness, and ostracism. The 10 year haze of life between then and now wasn’t bad by any stretch, but I realize now that it was killing me. 

So, morals of the story are: Your life begins when you decide it begins, and not a moment sooner. It is never too late. Use the lessons of the past to ghide your future, and give yourself a whole hell of a lot of love, patience, and grace along the way. Life’s short, be holistic about it."

"My father always viewed african americans as lazy saying they were too lazy to get themselves out of poverty and trouble. As i grew up i realized its a lot more complex and that the cycle of poverty is vicious no matter who you are where you are or what race you are. We all need to help lift each other up where we can. In my mind every soul is equal and were all just trying our best. He also didnt like their culture. As i age, im trying to appreciate it it more. A black man blares rap in a jacked up truck and its ghetto, but a white woman blares rap in her jacked up jeep and thats just stacy on the way to school. Their culture is grown here, through the pain and sorrow, and the beauty of art movements. It deserves as much respect and understanding as my “white suburban culture”.

TLDR: my dad thought AAs were lazy and loud, but i am learning to love everyone and appreciate everyones culture"

There may not be a huge population of girls out there like this, but surly it's not just me. "

"Oh yes, I'm totally on board with this. While my husband and I have some mutual hobbies we also have large portions of our free time that we spent apart doing our own thing where the other is maybe appreciative but wouldn't really want to participate. But on all major life decisions so far we've been in the same boat. This also is really good for getting advice because I can trust him to keep my long term interests in mind. 

That being said, we're not one hundere per cent on the same page politically. But I actually like that he is a bit more skeptic and level headed because he keeps me grounded like that."

"It was kind of awful. I was raised very religious, so I’d been told my entire life that my virtue was basically the most important aspect about me. That if I had sex outside of marriage, I’d be the chewed up gum/walked in sneakers/licked cupcake whatever horrible analogy. But sex within marriage was fine! But nobody tells you how impossible it is to change your entire mindset in literally one day. Even though logically, I knew it was okay to have sex with my now husband, I still felt like shit after. I felt like I had just given up my most valuable asset. And that if we divorced, no other man would possibly want me. I was all used up. 

On top of that, it felt very ritualistic. It didn’t feel like we were two people desperately in love who wanted to be with each other. Instead, it was my wedding night: the night that we would take each other’s virginities. It felt so clinical. And also painful for me because I wasn’t aroused at all, I was nervous as hell. So even though we went incredibly slow, used tons of lube, and my husband was so sweet and gentle, it was not enjoyable at all. 

It took us a good six or seven years (and leaving the church we both grew up in) to get to the point where we started to be completely comfortable with each other. I love my husband dearly and wouldn’t change marrying him. But if I could go back in time, I’d definitely tell us to slow the fuck down and really get to know each other before rushing into marriage and kids. One of the biggest reasons we got married so fast (hadn’t even known each other a year) was because we wanted to tear each other’s clothes off. But we couldn’t because we were “saving ourselves”.

Tl;dr: Waited until marriage, 2/10 do not recommend. "
Surely you can't be serious.
"Hey! Not the person you originally asked but to make it simple, an Obgyn is a doctor who has done four years of undergrad, four years of med school, and their residency (at least in the US). A midwife is (at least in the nursing field) someone who got their 4 year nursing degree, then went to a masters degree for specialty training. In the US, anyway, there really aren't many, if any, midwives who aren't nurses at this point. "
Oof ouch owie my insecurities. 
"Well I went to an all girls school and everyone found out that I had sex with one of my classmates, when I was 15....so that was fun."
Probs the second or third time I took my ex back for cheating 
Moisturise meeeeee
What’s the difference between a midwife and a... normal baby delivery person? Obgyn maybe? (Sorry for the ignorance.)
"&gt;  Additionally, male wardrobe malfunctions don't tend to slightly reveal their undergarments. There's no aspect of titillation involved. 

Speak for yourself. I hike my boxers up to my nipples and wear crop-top shirts. It's subtle... but very sexy."
"The thing about getting closure from an ex, especially who cheated, is its likely they don’t even know. I feel like when people do the whole “we’re getting coffee to talk and get closure” they’re expecting the other person to have clear bullet points prepared and that’s just rarely the case. If the reason were so obvious you would figure it out yourself. Some people make terrible decisions and never get down to why they did it or what made them unhappy enough to do it in the first place, so they can’t relay that information to you.

And if they do have a reason, it’ll probably make you feel like shit just like not knowing does. It’s best for all of us to just move forward, take stock of what we learned, and try again with someone else.

"I was just thinking this! People always rubbish it, but Darcy was genuinely surprised he was rebuffed/came off the way he did, and then went away and worked on his character and tried to improve himself. When he saw her again the next few times he didn't try and press his suit, but just tried to show that he had changed. His actions in saving Lydia show his love, but the fact that he tried very hard to do it AND not let Elizabeth know, show that he was trying not to show off, and was just showing that he was being sweet and generous. And then when they DO talk about feelings again, he gives her the option to say one word and he would fuck off again. I think P&amp;P gets rubbished so much, but it is genuinely so good!"

"Emotionally and mentally I was/am completely fine. I have no regrets about it whatsoever, even 14 years later. I was unknowingly pregnant at my high school graduation, found out the week after I graduated, and then had the abortion done as soon as I could before going to college in the fall.

"The Set Up on Netflix was pretty good, there's not much of a ""man pursues woman"" situation going on but still a good romcom"
"I went through a bit of this, so I started creating value instead! I volunteer for two non-profits, which has grown into training &amp; leadership roles for both. I also do some hobby stuff like crafting, which can be given to friends, family, or donated. Instead of picturing myself in a house or doing travel for travel's sake, I picture myself passing on knowledge, growing confidence in others, and making them smile in small ways. "

"I’m not married (we’re not even engaged), but if he ever decides to ask me to marry him, I’d say yes. 

Four months into us dating we decided to go roller blading. I’d done it when I was younger, and I remember being fairly good at it. I took a nasty fall and broke my fibula 

He immobilized my ankle, picked me up, drove me to the hospital. Was there by my side through the ex-rays, the pre-surgery visit with the surgeon. He drove me to the surgery, the post surgery visits, the physical therapy sessions. He was there through every step of the way. I lived in a 2 story apartment, he moved in, made me breakfast prior to work, setup my work computer (I was able to telecommute for my job) came home during his lunch, and made dinner every night until I was weight bearing on my ankle. 

I’m now almost 9 months post surgery, and we did a 6 mile hike yesterday. I don’t think my recovery could have been this fast and painless without him. 

Edit: I misstated the bone I broke, apparently not part of the ankle. But physical therapy was for my ankle. "
Well that escalated quickly
"None, my high school friends were super low key. "
"I go back and forth on the value of grammar schools (schools which are selective based on test results). I've seen so much research which suggests that grammar schools are not good for social mobility, increase inequality and perpetuates a two tiered school system which disproportionately disadvantages poorer pupils. My job is literally to try to tackle educational inequalities and promote opportunities to all, so in my field, basically everyone I talk to is against grammar schools. And I totally agree, in their current implementation in the UK, they are not a good thing.

But I still can't disagree with them on principle, because ultimately, the issue comes down to the fact that there are good schools and bad schools, and the difference in schools can lead to huge differences in pupil outcomes. There can be good grammar schools and bad grammar schools, just as there are good non-selective schools and bad non-selectives; in the current implementation, grammar schools tend to be better than most in school performance, but how much of that is down to factors which all good schools tend to exhibit like being in wealthier postcodes? Would having more grammar schools in a diverse range of areas affect some of these results?

But if I'm honest with myself, the reason I find it so difficult to reconcile is not down to any intellectual debate, but because of my own background. I was a poor disadvantaged student (raised by a single immigrant mother) who got into a grammar school after passing these entrance tests with flying colours. I didn't get any help with the tests, no tutoring, no support from my primary school (which was a terrible primary school, only something like 5% of pupils met age related expectations when they left). I recognise I'm a bit of a 'unicorn', and I know from my own experiences that I was the only child in my school who was eligible for free school meals, one of two ethnic minority students, one of very few from a single parent household etc.

I am certain that a large part of my future success in life has come down to having gone to a good grammar school and being in an environment which was able to challenge me intellectually. The social mobility afforded me by the opportunity to go to a great school, despite my background, has been invaluable. And I think in principle, that's what grammar schools can provide. It's just the reality is that you're more likely to do well in an 11+ test if you're from a more advantaged background, so grammar schools become stacked with those kids who go onto do well, and it only perpetuates the inequality."
"With the follow up:

""Why not?""

""I don't want to.""

And repeat like a broken record every time they ask. \*They're\* being rude by pushing it and making you repeat yourself. You don't owe anyone an explanation for anything. And stating a reason is just giving them fodder to argue."
"Reading this just made me smile so hard. I love that too, it makes me so happy (especially when I remember it the next day)"
Either when I agreed to hang out with that creepy way older almost homeless dude to do hard drugs or when I decided to get married at 19 to a guy I just met. There would be applause when I decided to get a divorce and go back to college. 
Yes. But gosh sometimes it's nice. 
"I kept pushing myself to meet new people, date, explore and push my comfort zone and learn new things. Distracted by action. Eventually I met someone who made them look like a chump and then it all cleared up. I think about my exes but not in the same way that hurts and leaves me wondering. Its more like, ""hmm that happened, life huh!"" And then go about my life. 

You think of them far less frequently and intensely. It's just like a memory not a real current hurt."
"We had been dating for about 4 months and I brought my kids I had with a different dude in high school over to meet him.

His face lit up as he pulled out some old video games and showed them how to play. When we getting ready to leave I told my children to thank him and my son ran over and hugged him with his thanks.

6 years later and we are married and have two more kids. I am happier than I ever thought possible."

"Lingerie is used to enhance the look of and draw attention to areas of a womans body that men may find attractive - boobs, butt, thighs etc. Mens underwear is... well just underwear, it doesn't really enhance the parts of the body women may find attractive like arms, shoulders, chest, legs etc. 

Dara O'Briain did a good comedy routine on stockings about this.

Oh man.. not just your grandmothers. I’m pretty sure “sanitary belts” were a thing well into the 60s/70s but I may be off on the timing. My mom (born in the 50s) remembers using them.

I thought I was his first. That bastard.
"Netflix released ""When we first met"" this year and I think they handle it quite well. There's no pressure put on the woman while the guy tries to change his ways to be attractive in her eyes, it's a pretty good romcom, where even though she sees him as just a friend there's never guilt-tripping talks of friendzone and such. Also it tackles the issue romcoms tend to ignore: simply not having chemistry with someone sometimes. Not to mention the ending, which I won't spoil, is amazing. 

Also the supporting characters are very likeable. It drags a bit on the start but when it gets going it's pretty good on its own. "

Wasn't this where the expression 'on the rag' came from? Since women used to use old rags attached via belt (or whatever apparatus they used at the time) during menstruation?

"People have called me emotionally unavailable (the words ""dead inside"" may have been uttered at some point) but I don't think I am.  I'm just not terribly expressive irl.  I don't like feeling vulnerable because so many people are willing to use your feelings against you when it suits them.  That doesn't mean I don't *have* emotions, though.  I just have to trust someone a lot to be more than cordially polite.  Unfortunately, I just don't have a lot of people I trust."
"&gt; Interim dating can help, but it often feels like peeing in your pants to stay warm; it's temporary and leaves you feeling icky and uncomfortable after.

"We worked together and he was my boss. I told him pants looked good (he had bought a new pair, and this was before we started dating). He looked me dead in the eyes and without missing a beat, says, ""My eyes are up here Scarred."". I still remember it to this day, and I decided right there that we were going to start dating. Now we're engaged, funny how life works."
"That’s pretty much the opposite. He continued to pursue her after being rejected, and used her short term memory against her, manipulating her and finding out what she liked when he knew she wouldn’t remember anything the next day."
"As a 32 year old with plenty of experience and a solid salary, let me just say: girl stop. You're no little girl, you're a goddamn PhD who took the time choose your path. 

There will always be someone doing more. With all my successes, my beautiful little girl, and a home I can call my own, I still have friends who are seemingly adulting harder. My best friend from high school - she's got a decent career, wonderful husband, and 4 crazy beautiful kids. She is so happy and feels light years ahead of me family-wise. My best friend from college - married and constantly getting recruited for her engineering skills. I make a very good living but I'll never come even close to taking the risks she has or reaping the same rewards. 

Being in your 30s, you really start to see people's choices playing out fully. I always feel worst for people whose hasty decisions have slowly but surely worn them down. You're exactly where you should be, and I'm so goddamn proud of you!"
"I’ve been struggling here recently. My SO is a very negative person. On the other hand, I am extremely positive and genuinely joyful. It’s been draining me. He is very social and constantly going out to hang with friends and I stay home with my dog. We’ve been together two years and just started living together. I can already say that after our lease ends, we likely will. I need sunshine and he isn’t that. "

I'm also losing weight!

I look forward to being an old cranky woman."
"Flirting would rarely be reciprocated. Any convos would be shorter and less meaningful. We'd take longer to respond to each other's texts. Overall, even though we were still just as close, the spark wasn't there anymore."
"In our group of friends there was a couple who'd been together like 5 or 6 years at this point (yeah it was weird). Anyway... My boyfriend, who was in the group before we starting dating, cheated on me with the girl, for months, with the boyfriend knowing. We had been together 2 to 3 years at this point too. 
It was really messed up. There were times they'd try to switch partners and stuff. I declined, and to this day feel stupid that I had no idea at the time. "
"I work for the corporate head office of a beauty company, which is contained in warehouses and manufacturing plants.

As such, and paired with our company ethics, the attire is a complete mishmash. You'll see a man walking around the warehouse in a bear costume one day, a suit the next. I myself wore pajamas to work yesterday and am dressed in business casual attire today.

Important meetings are kind of interesting to observe when you're in them as it brings everyone to the surface and highlights the diversity. The person being taken most seriously could be someone with rainbow hair, a hello kitty t-shirt and cargo shorts in furious discussion with what looks like a stepford wife."
