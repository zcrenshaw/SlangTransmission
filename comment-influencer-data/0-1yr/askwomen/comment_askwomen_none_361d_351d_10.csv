"Using exhaustion as a status symbol or badge of pride. Like, humble bragging about how much is on your plate and one-upping people about how little you sleep. “Oh, you only slept 4 hours last night? Well I slept 2 and then got up and had to take care of my three toddlers. You think you have it bad with one kid? Better enjoy sleep now before you have 2/3/4!” Etc. When did being a sad zombie mean being successful at whatever you do?"
"I used to work with a woman who was training to be a massage therapist. She landed a job at a spa but was explicitly told that she was not allowed to work the front desk because of her appearance.  She was told that she had to stay in the back room and was only allowed to treat established clients, not new customers. The good looking therapists were encouraged to work the front desk and entice new customers.

She was paid the same as everyone else, but it really killed her confidence and self esteem."
"It's become a faux pas to be the person who catches feelings first, or who wants commitment or something serious. And while I'm all for taking things slow, and think that jumping into commitments right away is ill-advised, this is different. This seems to be an emotional game where the person who is the least invested wins. It is cruel to toy with someone's emotions like that and it's not a healthy foundation for a relationship if things do become serious. If it's tacky and gauche to be excited to fall in love, then I hope to never be cool. 

There seems to be an expectation that upon your first meeting that you should be able to feel a spark, and if you don't, then it's not meant to be. But a lot of people aren't going to feel that way with someone who is essentially a stranger to them after meeting for the first time, even if their date is cute, has a warm personality and is a good conversationalist. These sort of things take time for a lot of people. An instant spark is cool if it happens, but it isn't a realistic expectation.  

There is an expectation that things should become sexual right away if you want to keep the other person around. And while I think that it's a good thing that casual sex is being destigmatized, I also don't think the expectation that you should jump into something sexual before you feel ready if you ever want a relationship is a healthy one.  Sex should be something both partners are eager and excited for, not an implied ultimatum. "
By random strangers who have no idea what is going on in my life and who just want me to smile for their benefit? A lot. They can fuck off. My facial expression isn't up for you to police.
Being embarrassed about acting sexy. You worry about looking funny and like you're trying too hard.

My boyfriend is in a bowling league. Every once in a while I'll call while he's there playing and ask the bartender to bring a round of drinks to him and his team and put it on my card. 
"I had to file a sexual harassment case against a coworker after some really awful things were said and done to me. Before this event, I had the standpoint that victims should always speak out for what’s right, call out abusers, and bring them to justice. After going through this process and being discredited and disbelieved by my boss, upper management in the company, and shunned by my coworkers, I understand why victims stay quiet. It made me wish I hadn’t even brought it up. "
"For most of my life I believed if I felt hurt someone had done something to hurt me. I was emotionally abusive to my husband about him [falsely] hurting me. 
Through therapy I learned my feelings are valid but not always based as a response to real actions. They can be a response to perceptions and assumptions and my fears, etc. Things are much better now. Much less dramatic and I'm much nicer."
"i think personality gets unattractive men farther than it gets unattractive women.  i heard recently something that i never realized before but it's stuck with me because i find that it's been true in my experience: you're more likely to see an unattractive man with a really attractive female partner than you are to see an unattractive woman with a really attractive male partner.  i've seen the first couple many times, whereas the second, i don't think i've seen at all (yet)."

"I had double eyelid surgery on one eye due to uneven eyelids (one eye had a natural double eyelid, the other did not). The unevenness made me self conscious even though no one ever noticed it. I still remember applying blue eyeshadow evenly on my eyes in middle school, and not understanding why one eye showed the blue and one eye didn’t when I had both eyes opened. 

I’m so glad I did the surgery. It was pretty minor (suture based, no incision so it’s reversible) but it made me feel a lot better about myself. Doing eye makeup was a bit easier too, because I used to have to do my eye makeup in a way to make my eyelids look even.

"Ghosting. I was recently ghosted by I guy I was seeing for FOUR months. We even took trips together. It’s so cruel when people do that.

Not being able to believe someone when they tell you you're beautiful.

"I had heard nothing but great things about him from my best friend, K (we'd been each other's best friends since elementary school so the Force is strong between us).  However, I met him and IMMEDIATELY all my bullshit flags went off.

First off, he refused to eat any form of fruit or veggies because he's allergic.  But I then proceeded to watch him eat stuff that was definitely veggies without any problems.  My ex was a doctor and thought it was fucking weird.

Secondly, he springs out that he has a nine year old daughter.  That itself isn't concerning.  What was concerning though was that he claimed his ex wife was crazy, that he hadn't seen his daughter is years because his ex wife wouldn't let him, and that he didn't HAVE to pay child support but he sent them a check every month anyway because it's his daughter and he loves her.

I naturally had questions about this.  Like...why didn't he just insist on his visitation rights?  

He claimed he didn't have any.

Why don't you have any?

""Because the court gave my ex full custody and told me I can't do anything without my ex's permission.""

Why did they give your ex FULL custody that bars you from seeing your kid? (Note: bullshit meter was FLYING by now)

Cue some story about him being a war vet, ending up partially paralyzed from the waist down (which he is not anymore because he went through robust physical therapy with his daughter as his inspiration), and the judge deciding that since he can BARELY take care of himself, he can't take care of the kid and blah blah blah.  

I just looked at K, who kept eating, and then mentally made a note to have a word with her later.

Oh, and, he adds, he's a registered sex offender because his wife's family prosecuted him from statutory rape.

WHAT?!

He then claims that his wife was sixteen/seventeen when they got married.  He had sex with her after they were married.  Her parents hated him and so called the cops.  He was arrested, tried, and put on a sex offender list for statutory rape.

I'd say you can't make this shit up, but he CLEARLY did so I was flabbergasted.

I then proceeded to try to warn K that I don't think he's honest or good.  She kind of shrugged it off, saying she wasn't sure they'd work out anyway.

Fast forward four years to her marrying him and I've stopped warning her because I'm afraid she'll just avoid me and stop communicating with me.  When the fallout happened, I wanted to be able to be there for my best friend.  I couldn't do that if she started forcing me out of her life for constantly telling her to leave him 

It took two months after they got married for the bombs to just start falling one after the other.  He did identity theft (of her), fraud, cheating, etc.  We're not even sure if he really did the jobs he claimed to do. 

I helped her through the divorce process.  At one point, he almost assaulted her.  Another time, he threatened to post up revenge porn of her.  All in all, it was incredibly rough.

There's more stuff, obviously.  About six months ago he called me out of the blue to tearfully confess he just got out of jail for kidnapping, domestic violence, and child endangerment.  He even lied about aspects of that.

Truly, he is the scum of the earth.

"The idea that if you're single, you must be constantly going on and looking for dates. I hated when I was single and people automatically assumed it meant that I was available and lonely. "
"My aunt's fiance. I was about 8 when we met for the first time. 8 year old me thought he had cool boots but he sneered when the adults weren't looking and he'd say small things to take my aunt down a notch. During the course of the evening I was sitting on the carpet because it was a holiday gathering but the adults had nabbed all the seats and he deliberately kicked me. He made like it was an accident but it wasn't because he made eye contact beforehand. 

Anyway, my aunt married him and after a few years she just kind of faded from the vibrant person she had been and withdrew. Luckily my grandmother is tenacious and no matter what made sure she kept in contact because my aunt finally admitted that he'd started abusing my aunt after the wedding. It took her years and financial help from family to get away from this guy and divorce him."
"As a teenager, I was very judgmental of the adults who were just kind of 'meh'--as in, they were basically normal, middle class, bill-paying adults, but they didn't really have much spark or ambition to them. They just went to their boring jobs, phoned it in for another day, got back in their Camry, and drove home to their crappy tract houses to watch mindless TV until bedtime. 

As an adult, I get it.

At some point, we all realize that we aren't going to be astronauts, and that we've already climbed the corporate ladder as high as it's going to take us. Sure, we *could* uproot our entire lives and risk everything we've spent the last decade-plus working towards, but why? So we can buy a marginally nicer Camry and tract house?

There's a lot to be said for a relatively easy, comfortable life."
"I was into drugs when we first met and he gave me an ultimatum that he would leave me if I did it again. I haven’t touched it since. 


We are now happily married with a house and two beautiful children.



Edit: Quite a few people were asking what drug, how long ago and my thoughts on the ultimatum. I was a functional addict for 15 years. Using mostly cocaine and was getting back into crystal meth (about 10 months in). It didn’t even seem like it was even a choice. I stopped without questioning it and didn’t struggled to do so because I knew I didn’t want to lose him. I am now 3 years sober."

"As someone who is athletic and is into fitness and sports, I hate it when people praise someone’s “grit” when they continue to perform or train when they have a serious injury that requires rest.

"I was thinking about this the other day. I mean, bullying, not getting equal job opportunities etc are often big examples of how society can treat unattractive women (especially for those without an assertive personality).

I've been hanging out with my four brothers recently, all in our 30's, and I was observing the way they walk with me. We all have great laughs together, but they never walk *with* me, beside me, and in fact they speedwalk ahead of me. Rarely will they sit alone with me at a pub or a restaurant. I realized they've done this my whole life, and I remember when I was a teenager I talked to a friend about this, and she told me that all boys have a fear of being mistaken for the boyfriend of the girl they're with, their sister. So I've always believed that. My brother awkwardly gives me a pat on the back at the airport instead of a hug, but that's okay because he's just self-conscious about being mistaken as my boyfriend or something. Right? I can get behind that. (I realize now this is a stereotype of men).

But then lately I've been seeing how my brothers interact with my sisters in a public setting. It's different. They walk together. They put their arms around each other. My sister once told me that my brother once made her come into a store with him so that his ex-girlfriend who works there would see him with a pretty woman. The only difference between me and my sisters, is that I'm the ugly one of the troupe. 

I know how ridiculous this is, but for some reason this is more hurtful than all of the other 'ugly' social problems I've encountered in life. These are my brothers. Like, it's hard being the person nobody wants to walk with. I could be imagining it, but I know my brothers, and while I know how wonderfully interesting and intelligent they are, I know that they also have shallow personalities. 

"
"This whole ""Don't rush things!"" attitude where you can't ask big questions too early. I mean, I don't want to go on loads of dates with someone and *then* ask them if they're looking for a serious relationship or what they think of marriage or if they want kids etc. What a waste of time and energy to date someone and then start to like them just to find out they want something from life that I would despise."
"Blind faith. 

Not so much in terms of religion, but in terms of day-to-day beliefs. People who refuse to acknowledge evidence that essential oils aren't panaceas or that vaccines don't cause autism, and then proudly state, ""I know what I know! I saw it with my own eyes! You'll never convince me otherwise!""

As soon as someone says ""you'll never convince me"", I believe them."
This is related to a deeper cultural issue where everybody is terrified of vulnerability.
"I don’t personally think of myself as unattractive (although it took me a long time to get my self-esteem to that point) but I remember going to a family reunion once and my uncle came to greet us. He went up to my sister and hugged her, raving about how beautiful she was, and then turned to me and went “oh hi Sehllae”. It was years ago but I’ve never forgotten it."

"One of my breasts never fully developed. By the time I was 16, my left was a full D, and my right an A. My doctor considered it a birth defect, as tissue never developed on the under side of the right one, but the top half grew somewhat normally. I was incredibly self conscious because it was pretty noticeable in clothes if I didn’t wear something in my bra to fill it out, and I could never be in bathing suits around people. 

At 17 I had a saline implant put in and it drastically changed my self esteem for the better. I could wear clothes that fit normally and comfortably, and i recovered just in time to fill out my dream prom dress. 

The only things I regret: 

1- I had it put in really early. While it helped high school me, adult me continued to grow chest wise. My left is a DD and my right is a small D. It’s noticeable with my shirt off but not much else, and it doesn’t bother me at all, but given a second chance I might’ve waited until I had grown more 

2- I did absolutely no long term research. At the time my health insurance covered a significant portion of the procedure because it was considered a birth defect, and my dad covered the rest. But implants need to replaced eventually, and I’m nearing 10 years post surgery with no health insurance and no 4K to spare on an emergency boob job

With that being said, I can’t imagine not having it done. It’s done wonders for my confidence! It came to light later that my sister had the same defect. The doctors think it’s either genetic (although we have no known history), or a side effect of my moms prolonged drug use either during or before pregnancy. We’re so lucky to have a great father, and I feel lucky I’m able to guide my sister through her process, something I wish I had myself. "
"Beauty seems to be fundamentally tied to what it *means* to be a woman. The definition of ""woman"" -  the typical, general woman always must be attractive by default.

I think societally, you're seen as having failed at being a woman if you're unattractive. You're barely considered a woman. 

Naturally, your perspectives and experiences are barely considered. Even in feminist discussions, it's the issues of attractive women that are elevated and given the most attention.

"Excessive drinking. I have cut out alcohol all together after a couple of bad incidents that happened while I was drunk. It really opens your eyes to how much our culture ( American at least, I can't speak for the rest of the world) embraces alcohol and it's excessive use.( ex Happy Hours in the business world ; Wine-o-clock/ Rose All Day mom wear; ""this is probably vodka"" water bottles. etc)"
Men putting you in awkward social situations by aggressively making it clear that they only see you as a friend. .. when the subject never even came up and you're not even remotely attracted to them.

"Anything like this that people try to frame as martyrdom, tbh. There's a meme going around on LinkedIn every few months that says like ""You work 40 hours a week? Ah, I remember my first part-time job."" 

Like...yes I do work 40 hours in my full time role? If you can't regularly get your work done in 40 hours, and you're not a business owner or at a startup, then probably your company either takes advantage of you or you just have poor time management skills. There is no honor in working more than 40 hours if you're a cog in a wheel. I'm very dedicated to my role and am legitimately invested in my company's success, so I deliver a lot in those 40 hours. 

edit: this pertains to regular, run of the mill salaried roles. If you're pulling 70 hours but getting paid for each of those 70 hours, or if you knew going in that your job would expect an on-call rotation, it's a bit different. "

"I say this as a public health researcher, but I wish people would ease off on the positive aspects of substance abuse. Yes, we all know the guy who can drink everyone under the table; we know the woman who is constantly stoned, and still makes six figures a year; and there's the dude who's just *so much fun* when he's on LSD. 

I have those people in my group of friends. 

But in the work I do, there are *so many more* examples of people whose lives have been ruined because they struggle with alcohol abuse, or whose careers have been sidelined because their pot use dissuades them from seeking better opportunities, or who do *really* stupid shit when they're on acid. But all those stories are just data, numbers, figures, statistics. 

For how entirely possible it is to enjoy alcohol and pot properly, it saddens me that the stories we tend to share are about going *absolutely fucking crazy* with that shit, and how the ability of certain people to do that, negates any need for care when it comes to using those substances. 

When I bring up the negative aspects of pot or stimulants, the acknowledgement is almost reluctant. ""Well, yeah, it doesn't work for *some people*, but the way *I* do it..."""

"The extra effort you need to make to be “acceptable.” I have a cute friends that will go out in pjs and hair a mess and it’s seen as ‘adorable’ whereas if I go out like that I’m gross and unkept. I’ve notice I get more, and better, attention when I’m out wearing full on makeup and dresses vs when I’m out in just jeans and a T-shirt and no makeup. I have very attractive friends who are sweethearts but I get self conscious being out with them because I don’t want the ‘ugly friend’ label so I often come up with excuses to not go out with them. They’ve never purposefully made  me feel ugly and are quite encouraging but I don’t think they realize how self-conscious I feel next to them. My weight has also vastly fluctuated and while I don’t personally equate fat with being ugly, I’ve also noticed I got more attention when I wasn’t super fat.

I work more than full time. It didn't last long. "
"I met both my now best friend and he ex boyfriend in college.  The ex and I had a class together, and he was the weed dealer at our dorm, so we would smoke before class sometimes and walk to class together.  I noticed immediately that despite being a little scrawny, average looking, he had this way of speaking that was extremely motivating.  I remember thinking, ""wow this guy could lead a movement,"" or what a great salesman he would make, his knack for persuasion - everything about the way he spoke from his word choice to ton of voice and volume, seemed incredibly powerful and I don't know why but I didn't really like it.  I felt like he was full of shit.  I saw him interact with other guy friends and he was manipulative.  It just kind of disturbed me.

So I didn't totally understand why my friend had this crush on him and felt kind of frustrated when they started dating, but she said things, ""When he looks at me it's like he can see my soul.  Like he can read my mind sometimes, he always says exactly the right thing I need to hear.""  Hmm, well as long as he has your best interest I thought...  

Two years in to their relationship, my friend started experiencing some weird things that would later be pinpointed to a sleep disorder.  Sometimes when someone would wake her up she would have a rage, screaming, hitting, just flipping out completely.  It would last for 3-5 minutes and then she'd just fall back asleep.  My friends and I quickly saw that it was connected to drinking - it would only and always happen when we'd had late heavy drinking nights and was exponentially worse if she had blacked out which did happen sometimes - usually when she had been hanging out with this guy before meeting up with my friends and I later in the night.  At the same time, she stopped wanting to hang out with us and spent all her time with her boyfriend, to the extent I never saw her for a month or two.

A few months after that all began, she broke down to me and told me she was abusing her boyfriend and he was stuck in an abusive relationship with her in denial of it all.  She was also an alcoholic.  I was super confused but just let her talk.  Later that night I decided to go meet her and her boyfriend + his friends instead of wait for her to come meet me.  He literally feeding her shot after shot in the most sly way, oddly could have come across as ""caring"" like he was just looking after her.  She blacked out and needed to pass out, so I said I'll take her back to your room (because I knew they slept together every night) and he said no lets take her to her room and I'll come get her later &amp; bring her to my room.  Didn't make any sense, her room was much farther away.  He was SO pushy about it and completely ignored my objections, changing the topic, trying to make a joke, turned it in to ""Oh you're such a good friend don't worry about it go have fun I'll take care of her.""  

I finally put together what was happening - he was getting her drunk, purposely waking her up, she would have a rage, he'd do it with other people around to see, and the next day he would tell her all the terrible things she did, what so-and-so said about her afterwards, add some manipulative words of his own into her story, and made her feel isolated, and like a monster.  She stopped hanging out with us because she was afraid she would ""abuse"" us too.  She told me they would have transactional sex due to this and she was constantly in the position of making it up to him.  Obviously he was the one abusing her, the manipulation was pretty astounding, and he's just as creepy as I always found him to be."
"Just because your husband couldn't hang doesn't mean nobody else can. My grandma lost a whole breast due to breast cancer and my grandfather was with her until she passed away many, many years later.

"Selfishness.  

For some reason not giving a fuck about others has become the epitome of being ""bad-ass"".

Women are often expected to be kinder than men, and I get that rejecting that can feel/be empowering.  I wish men were pushed to move closer to the caring end rather than the other way around."

Me: Yeah but where'd she get it?

Him: Oh (confused that I was genuinely interested in his shirt). 

i think about that often. I don't feel insulted or anything, I just think about it often and chuckle a bit. Yeah dude, not everyone is hitting on you and especially not every fat chick is hitting on you."

"Walter White's wife, Skylar. Imagine being pregnant and having a dying husband who decides making and selling meth is the way to go. "
"When I was a kid - I made my parents and other people laugh a lot. And I grew up in a house full of siblings as the only girl, with some pretty heavy extended family situations, and discovered really early that I was good at diffusing tension.  
  
It’s helped me socially for sure - having a personality that can put other people at ease, and having the ability to laugh at yourself makes integrating a lot easier, especially when you’re the “new person”. "
"People who bowed out of activities because they have babies. I would just think, why don’t they just bring their kids with them? Why don’t they just get their kids used to going to different places? Etc..  After having a kid who was a screeching psycho demon without a nap, mixed with my sleep deprivation, I understood... Total karma."

"Very true and I know this sounds awful, but I watched Sierra Burgess is a Loser last night and it would be so ridiculously rare that a super handsome guy who is nice and funny etc... would actually want to date Barb from Stranger Things. "
"Everyone here is making me realize I need to get my life together. I work 7am-7pm. I usually snooze my alarm until 6:20. Brush my teeth, wash my face, put my hair in a pony tail and put on some mascara. I leave at 6:45, so I usually get to lay back down for another 10 minutes and then think about how much I’d rather die than to work. "
"I mean it was more than a bad feeling, my friend casually dropped into a group conversation, ""Don't you hate it when a guy pressures you into anal sex?"" And all of us are like...um... I tried to talk to her about how that's really not good but she didn't think it was a big deal and was convinced that all guys would do the same. They were together for another year after that before he cheated on her for being 'frigid'. :/"
"Went in at 5AM (on my period no less) left at 3 PM the same day, no more periods! Goodbye tampons and pads! Everything done laparoscopic makes this a much easier process.  A good three or four days on the couch and then up and slowly at ‘em about a week later.  Went back to work half days after week 2 and full time after week 3. Biggest thing was being tired all of a sudden occasionally and now still some residual light pain/sensitivity internal where the scar tissue is (4 yrs later) but 100% would do this again.  I was a little bummed at first when this was the decision the doctor presented to the issues I was having but then couldn’t figure out why I was bummed out.  From a preventative standpoint and to fix the issues, it was the right one to make and I have three kids so there was no point holding on to something I no longer needed.  Now, best thing ever!  No more periods,  cancer possibilities reduced,  no constant worry about odd spots or pain.  Amazing!"

"You can’t wear tights and a tank top to work. 

Why?  Everyone else does.  It’s very hot outside in Florida....in August. 


It looks different on you, wear jeans and a loose fitting tee shirt or find another job.   We don’t want to promote that type of atmosphere. "
"Unattractive women are invisible.

Unattractive men get to be President."
Seriously.  I won't wear sexy dresses or put on fancy makeup or do my hair up because I feel like I look so silly and like I'm trying to be something I'm not.  The idea of getting truly glammed up for a night out is so foreign to me. 
"I had a rhinoplasty done this year. My life is SO MUCH BETTER. My nose wasn’t the worst thing ever, but I had a hump and I didn’t like its shape. I’d wanted a nose job since I was a teenager. Now, weirdly, the best part of it is that I don’t think about my nose. Unless I’m looking in the mirror, it’s no longer on my mind like it was before. It’s not a worry I carry with me everywhere anymore. And when I do look in the mirror, my cute nose I have now makes me so happy. It’s really just been a huge weight lifted off my shoulders.

In terms of others, I don’t think anyone would have pin pointed my nose was different afterwards. I think it looked like something was different but people weren’t sure what. But I didn’t do this for others, I did it for me. And I’m so glad I did.

Edit: so many replies! Thanks everyone! A couple people have asked how much it was and I mention it in the comments but I figured I’d include it up here - it was 8,500 USD"
"Ugly women are are never taken into consideration. When people name off “perks” of being a woman like getting free shit or getting any guy they want, they’re talking about young, attractive women. Ugly women aren’t ignored, they’re straight up off the radar-non existent. You’re not a human woman if you’re an ugly woman. That’s how it feels.  That’s how it is. God forbid an ugly woman try to be anything more. "

"I’m not sure if it was technically a cosmetic surgery, but I had a breast reduction when I was 18 or 19 and I have absolutely no regrets. One of the best decisions I’ve ever made.

I feel more comfortable in my skin, I can exercise more easily, and I just look better. The saggy, drooping boobs didn’t suit my frame (or personality [*the size of them] ) at all. 

*Edit: Confusing sentence"
"I keep a list on my phone of little things I love, and I read it when I need a pick me up. Sure, life isn't all exciting adventures and glamorous vacations, but damn it if Saturday morning pancakes aren't the best things ever. Or a good boob day. Or the way my dog sits like a human sometimes. "
"I hate rushing, I give myself extra time so that I can drink my coffee and fuck around on my phone for a little bit and do a few yoga poses. I do as much as I can the night before to prepare, and lately I've been keeping my phone on the other side of the room when I sleep so that I don't hit the snooze and wind up rushing. "
"The general expectation that men should ask women out on the first date, and that women should initiate the ""what are we"" conversation about escalating it to a relationship. 

Everybody just do what you want already. Finding a good partner is hard, why are we making it more difficult for ourselves. "
"I had a tummy tuck. From weight gain/ loss I had a big piece of tummy that hung over and wouldn’t go away no matter what I did. Getting it removed was the best thing I’ve ever done. Exercising was easier, my clothes fit better and the impact on my confidence was huge. "
"Totally agree. Had a colleague shouting at me at work last week, for something I didn't do (although even if I had, it would have been unnecessary). When I said it he was being unprofessional, he said, 'That's just me, that's how I am'. Well then, 'just you' is not good enough. You're fifty three, time to grow the fuck up."
I always think this is really why women are brave for coming forward. Like I don’t think it’s any less brave if you want to keep a horrible personal memory to yourself but women who do are brave for the fact that they’re risking social stigma and re-victimization not for coming out as abused women. Just my thoughts. 
"I've been trying to put this into words for a while, but I'm tired of this idea that every woman has to be a ~boss babe~. I hate the social media phenomenon around it. When you wake up in the morning and the first thing you do is make that #riseandgrind, #nodaysoff post, who is that really for? To me it just reeks of insecurity.

I believe in hard work, but I don't believe the world needs to be constantly reminded to work harder. It's OK to take a day off, it's OK to prioritize your own needs, and I'd argue that it's necessary to fail sometimes. I'm never going to be inspired by someone who's in work mode 24/7. "
"Getting divorced. I was always judgmental of people who broke their vows, saying any marriage could be saved (domestic abuse aside). Being divorced myself I am way more understanding and less judgements. You can't save a marriage if only one person wants to work at it."
"Anecdotally I know tons of physically unattractive women with excellent professional skills and high intelligence that do very well in society. That being said, for a man these traits also gain him the attention of women. For a woman, they are separate "
"Agree! People argue with me ""What if they get scared off?""

If they get scared off by big conversations early, then I don't want to waste multiple dates with them!"
"I was the abusive one in my first relationship. I was emotionally and verbally abusive. At the time, I didn't realize it. I was a selfish kid. I'm glad that I was able to grow up and recognize how abusive I was, though that doesn't heal the damage I caused. I have apologized deeply and sincerely to my ex and continue working on healing the hurts I caused by my actions. We are still friends, thankfully."
"Not sure how true it is but I remember watching a psycology channel of some sort and it said something along the lines of:
If you're an unattractive male but are intelligent your chances of women finding you attractive is 70% however if you're an unattractive female yet intellegent, only 20% or something like that.
I know it's poorly worded sorry for that"
"Extremely bothered. Telling someone to smile implies they are obligated to do so, especially when the person doing the telling is bigger and stronger. It's controlling, it's menacing, it's threatening, and it's meant basically a command. "
"""He bullies/picks on you because he likes you!"" 

No, he picks on me because his parents didn't raise him right. He doesn't respect me. And doesn't understand what consent means when I repeatedly ask him to stop. Don't romanticize terrible habits. No young girl needs to chase a guy who treats her like she doesn't mean shit.

&amp;#x200B;

In a similar context..

My parents justify my grown-ass 25 year old brother's bullying as tough love. It's not. It's hate and he doesn't respect me, or acknowledge my complete discomfort being in a room with him. They don't get it, but I don't think I have much of a relationship to salvage with him."
I can understand if it happens after one or two dates.  Still feels like a gutless move to not be upfront that you're not interested and leave the other person wondering what happened.  But to go on for 4 months and then just vanish is just downright cruel. 
"Related/unrelated, but I went out for dinner with a friend and it was my treat because she got laid off from work and dumped by her bf in the same week. From start to finish our waiter never made eye contact with me even while asking for my order, but went above and beyond recommending drinks and food for her.  The one and only time he made eye contact with me was when he realized I was the one paying for the entire meal. Not proud to admit but I left an extremely poor tip...probably in his mind reenforcing that ugly women = ugly personality, but I hated that entire evening. It’s like I don’t even merit common human decency. "
"I have naturally curly/wavy hair. A dude asked me this in these scary words: 

Dude: Why is your hair so messy?
Me: It’s not messy... that’s my natural hair. It’s just curly. 
Dude: Do you ever not wear your hair up?
Me: I’m a nurse so no. Not really...
Dude: Do you ever straighten your hair?
Me:... Why?
Dude: I want to see what it looks like when your hair isn’t messy. 
Me: No. "
Getting an Iphone with the thumbprint lock.  Thought it was just stupid and lazy.  Then I got one.  Now I want to throw my phone into a lake every time I have to enter in the passcode like some sort of 2010 peasant.

"My best friend started dating this guy while in the process of separating from her husband. Her husband wasn’t an awful guy, just sort of lazy and inconsiderate at times. But they had been together since she was 19 and they had definitely outgrown each other. 


Before I even met the guy, flags started going off. Whenever we would hang out, she started taking selfies of us to send him to show who she was with. When I asked about him, she told me that he had five kids and still lived with their mother for the kids sake. I expressed concerns about that situation, but she assured me that he was telling her the truth. The next time I saw her, she had him on the phone on a Bluetooth the whole time. I had to whisper explain that he was monitoring her, but she assured me that it was just because they both worked crazy jobs so this is the best way for them to talk. 


A few months go by, and I meet him on Christmas Day. He is there, not with his children, all day. The entire time he’s there, he is treating her son like shit, calling him a whiny bitch and other assorted mean things. The entire time she’s just fawning over this guy, and even slipped out with the guy, leaving my husband and I to watch her son, while she presumably fucked this guy in his truck. When she came back my husband and I left quickly and on the ride home we discussed all the red flags. 


The next time I saw her, I explained how I didn’t like how Christmas played out. She apologized profusely, said she was drunk. I tried to offer her my best advice, and point out all the different ways he was manipulating her. I also called out that all this guy wanted to do was put a baby in her. She confided in me that she had been pregnant and lost a baby already. Though it proved my point I wanted to be kind to her because that’s a difficult thing to go through. 


A few months later I stayed with her for a week to help her with her son, and to help her pack to move. At this point she was losing her house, several months behind on rent. I pointed out that her boyfriends other lady wasn’t losing her house, and that this guy was putting her in a bad situation. 


That whole week I felt like the boyfriend was terrorizing me the entire time. I use medical marijuana for multiple sclerosis, and he kept telling her that me being there was a liability for her custody situation. I never even brought it in the house. He came by every day and I convinced another one of our friends to come by in the evenings to help make it less weird, since my friend practically ignored me when he was there. The other friend was a guy, and boyfriend didn’t like that. When guy friend and I were out back hanging out, boyfriend came out and started flashing his gun at guy friend. That was enough for me. 


When she drove me home, I told her everything I felt. No more sugar coating. Because she was losing her house, she had boxes she wanted to store in my garage in case she got locked out/evicted. I didn’t see her for a while after that. I couldn’t bring myself to talk to her. I googled her at some point because there was a serial killer in her town and I honestly didn’t know if she was alive or dead. I saw she had been arrested for possession of oxy, cocaine and morphine. A few months later she popped up at my house with her boyfriend to pick up the boxes. She was eight months pregnant. I knew it was over. She texted me once to say she had the baby, and I said congratulations, and I never spoke to her again. 


It honestly breaks my heart that it played out like this. I miss her, I miss her son, I had known him since he was a baby, but she lost custody of him. This guy was so toxic, I just couldn’t be around it anymore, and with the baby now, he’s not going away. I think of her all the time and hope that one day she gets out of it. She lost everyone in her life over this guy. He is 100% in control of her, and since I could see through his bullshit, he wasn’t going to let our friendship continue. 

I’m so sorry for the wall of text. This has been weighing very heavily on me, and it all just sort of poured out. 


Edit: After reading all of these other posts, so many of these stories are so similar. It’s so sad. I’m just going to leave this here, it could help someone recognize abuse in someone’s life, or even their own.

"Being a jerk and treating people poorly because they are a considered a genius.

You can run a successful company and be nice to people. "
"I've been attracted to a seemingly nice boy. After the third date, he calmly informed me that I would now leave the university, marry him and be a stay at home mom.

There was no fourth date. "
"My husband doesn’t just have a sweet tooth, he has a sweet body. Man can eat sugar like no other. I enjoy attempting new recipes so I pay attention to desserts he buys at restaurants and stores and then will try to make them at home for him as a surprise. "
"I have a niece who was only 3 or 4 when I was with my ex, and I knew when I introduced him to the kids that something was wrong. My niece who has always been a naturally friendly kid shied away from him instinctively. She didn't trust him, wouldn't play with him, wouldn't get close enough for contact of any kind... Maybe I had a slight suspicion that something was off about him, but the kiddo's instinct to pull away from him was a loud and clear signal to me. "
"I  once straight up told two grown men on their 50s to go fuck themselves when they told me to smile while passing me on the street.
I can't understand how that has become something acceptable to say to strangers on the streets."
"This drives me up a goddamn wall. How is being unable to feed himself or his children cute? It's just laziness and irresponsibility. And it also drives me crazy how often they'll get praise when they do actually do it. No, my husband isn't amazing because he changes our babies' diapers. He's not amazing because he cleans up after himself. He's not amazing because he cooks dinner. He's doing what he's supposed to as a grown ass man, husband, and father. "
"I'm also 100% the kind of person who tends towards solitude.  I used to tell my husband all the time that I simply have close to zero social drive.  I feel driven to spend time with one person, that's it.  I never feel lonely, and I have always felt content with my life independent of the size of my social circle.  It's like if people were food, I could eat the same thing every day and I get no joy out of eating other food, so I don't seek it out.  Seeking it out is a lot of work.

Here is the danger in resigning yourself to the smallest social network possible:  you don't realize what you need other people for until something catastrophic happens.

My husband died two months ago and when he died, I wanted to die too.  I wanted to be alone and I wanted to quit.  My hobbies and my interests were meaningless to me.  The only thing that mattered to me was my husband, and he was gone.  But we had just had a baby boy, and I was the only person who mattered to him.

I was in a psych ed group recently and they had a class about social support.  There was a short perceived social support questionnaire that listed categories like:  ""Acceptance"" ""Encouragement"" ""Companionship"" ""Partner for activities"" ""New Ideas"" ""Help with tasks"" ""Guidance"" and stuff like that.  Then a space to name the person in your life who you go to for each, and a space to note if you're satisfied in that category or need more support, etc.

My list was so empty, because I would have written my husband's name under every single category.  I didn't even know that he fulfilled all of those specific things in my life.  But in any case, he was dead.  I realized that my ideas of what I ""need"" people for was so shallow, and when I actually needed people, I did not know who to go to.  Not because they don't exist, but because I never identified them and never cultivated those relationships.  And selfishly, I never realized that I'm supposed to fulfill these roles for other people too, but I withheld myself because it was ""hard work"".  You delude yourself into believing that you don't need these things in order to live a full life, or that you alone can provide all of this for yourself.

I think that most people will read the quote in the title and think about it in terms of socialization as in, just talking to others or ""having friends"".  I am sure that when Jim Carrey said it, he was talking about the danger of solitude in the face of darkness in your life, whether it is mental illness or the hopelessness that comes with tragedy.  The only sure thing in life is tragedy.  Social support is the only thing that can create hope out of nothing."
"When my acne was really bad, I got this shit all of the time.  You'd think they didn't realise that I already knew what my face looked like.  "
"I got lasik and have had a horrible experience since day 1. My eyes are always dry and I've spent more money on eye drops than I have on food. 

My complaints have always been met with, ""use more eye drops"" or ""give it time."" It's been almost a year and I use eye drops ALL THE TIME. 

Don't get me wrong, I love seeing in 20/20, but even my optometrist has told me that the dryness is keeping my eyes from reaching their full potential. It sucks, but all I can do is continue to drown my eyes in eye drops and wait for things to improve. "
Jealousy - oh it's so romantic!
Where you both accept each other for who you really are. Where you both have a level of trust that you are both comfortable with. I feel like these are the two main components to a healthy sibling relationship.
"I feel like we need different terms for different levels of ghosting. To me, ghosting is abruptly stopping a convo on a dating app, or not replying to the guy you drunkenly have your number to at a bar. What happened to you is sociopathic... "
This is really profound and something we could all benefit from understanding. 
"You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.  
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you.  
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun."
That’s such a great idea! You’re appreciating/supporting that he’s with his friends and having a good time and that doesn’t mean you have to be included. 
"Morticia and Gomez are more or less #couplegoals. They make an effort to maintain the excitement and passion in their relationship, they support each other, and they accept each other's weirdness."
"If you have a flare-up of a skin condition, you become a social leper. You'll be assumed to be on drugs, carrying a communicable disease and/or that it's due to a lack of personal hygiene. You get no empathy for the pain you're in. People will stare at you. They'll make rude comments. People are not shy about how you gross them out. You become a monster until it heals and you go back to being plain and invisible again. "
"FOODS: Pumpkin spice, cinnamon, roasted yam with butter, snickerdoodles, soups and creams, add cinnamon to your hot chocolate, roasted veggies and/or meat. Eat more veggies of season, to be even more immersed in the season.

HOME: change the decor a bit (add fluffy covers, pillows if you have some) put some candles (if you can), change a bit everything, so in your mind it's shifting to Fall.

SELF: observe the changes with the leafs, the birds that fly south. Start something related to self-care that you would not do before (baths with salts and candles, a body lotion for dryness, picking up meditation) clean your environment thoroughly to prepare it for the cold season (again to mark the shift to Fall, you can get out the winter specific stuff (temporary carpets for the entrance, by example).

Specifically about October, it's pretty much putting out decorations at the start of the month, and adding some DIYs and store-brought decorations progressively. I do personally like to dress up a bit in my witch costume to put out the decorations."
I had a guy pull this shit on me once. He told me he was surprised he was so into me because i'm not his type at all and how he used to date models back in his snowboarding days.  He went on about how he learned looks aren't that important and he should appreciate girls who are pretty on the inside. I just sat there totally stunned.  I couldn't believe he actually did not realize how fucked up that was to say to me as he was running his mouth.  He thought he was such a great person I guess...
"Knowing that if someone does say that, they're probably trying to sell you something."
This.... made me really sad. I'm sorry you have to feel these feelings.  :(  
She wanted me to end contact with every other human being on the planet besides her. Don't know how i managed to deal with this for more than a year.
"""Can you just lay there until I get a nut?"" 

This was in college. His full, disgusting spiel was, ""I know you don't like me like that, but I'm real horny."" I asked him how the fuck is that my problem. He answered, ""But you don't have to do anything. Can you just lay there until I get a nut?"" So appealing, right ladies. 

I told him I was surprised that he was such an asshole, and if he ever said anything like that to me again I was going to put it on the *Girl Grapevine,* and he'd never get laid at that school."
"Yes. Socialization is like pooping. I hate having to do it, but if I don't I'll eventually explode.

"I judged people when they were taking too long to move on after a breakup, I always had this stupid idea that after a breakup you are just more liberated and have tons of options for more prospective partners that are waiting around the corner for you to be single. I didn't quite get why people always wanted to have just one single partner for the rest of their lives making it even more miserable for themselves by hindering opportunities or experiences; I thought of these things because my parent's marriage was a downhill catastrophe. Until I met this one guy and my third eye opened where I saw the world and myself differently. Unfortunately it didnt work out with him and turns out that no matter the fact that I am single, I am still not liberated from the emotional burden I carry around me and it has now started to make sense why some people struggle to get better after a breakup. "
"I'm a big reader, and I really don't appreciate it when my books don't match. Like, I have the first trilogy of the Kushiel's Legacy series in large paperbacks, but the second and third trilogies only come in mass market paperbacks. And I have An Ember in the Ashes and the sequel, A Torch Against the Night, in the original cover, but they republished them with new covers and the third one only comes in the new cover. Same with Defy the Stars- I have it in the original hardcover, but the paperback and it's sequel, Defy the Worlds, are a different cover.

Or when I already have a series, but they come out with new covers that I like better (the blue editions of Harry Potter, the foil editions of The Hunger Games, the new edition of Vicious, the new edition of the Grisha trilogy).

Or when series aren't numbered! And I hate movie tie-in covers.

...I have a lot of strong feelings about books."

"I've been with my current boyfriend for over four years. He loves video games, and I like a few but I'm really picky about which ones I end up enjoying. Recently he got sad that I don't branch out and play more video games that he enjoys. I told him that I have no problem sitting on the couch reading while he plays his games. But he wants to bond with me over games more so we recently struck a deal - I told him for every game I play with him he has to read a book of my recommendation and talk about it with me. I told him it wouldn't be fair for me to branch out into his hobbies if he wasn't willing to branch out into mine. 

He agreed, but that agreement was reached about two months ago and he hasn't asked me to play any games since. I told him I would start him out with an easy book to get him going. I wasn't planning on slamming House of Leaves onto a non-reader. We'll see how it goes! "
"GHOSTING! F*ck anyone who does this. If you ‘threw your hat into the ring’ and decided to date someone, then the very least you can do is have some manners when you are finished and go politely pick up the ‘hat’ and say “I’m not interested anymore, this isn’t going to work.” "
"Porn has, unfortunately, convinced many young men (and probably some older ones too) that a vagina is an inverted penis on steroids. 

So they think that inserting anything into the vagina makes women tremble and moan and scream with orgasmic pleasure.

I mean, hell, in porn it isn't even good enough for a woman to have orgasms or multiple orgasms. . she has to have a vagina that squirts out orgasmic fluid just like a dick does! "
"I like picking up weird food items that I think he'd like. I got him portabello mushroom jerky yesterday. He likes alcohol, fancy beauty stuff (skincare, beard oil), food, etc. "
"I never understood why my parents were mostly always so irritable. But now, being on the other side, I know that bills, unexpected expenses racking up the credit card, cooking a meal that barely gets touched, repeating yourself 1,000 times, and basically everything else that has to do with being a parent and adult can really piss a person off lol. "
"Cho Chang. People attack her for being too ""whiny"" and ""clingy,"" but her boyfriend was murdered, and no one believed that his murderer returned. To me, I think she's a really strong character. She still stood up for what she believed in by fighting in the Battle of Hogwarts and joining the DA even though she was going through an emotionally hard time."
"Sleeping, and how we have a special place and special clothes to lie down completely unconscious for roughly 1/3 of our lives. "
"Ok this may sound like a joke but it’s real... I had cosmetic surgery on my vagina (labiaplasty), and honestly everything about my sexiness has changed. I can wear tight little thongs, really naughty lingerie, and tight swimwear without being self conscious. It’s also way more comfortable! My sex life has skyrocketed. I feel amazing and finally look the way I always wanted to. I can have rough sex without it hurting. I can play with toys without my lips getting in the way. Sex FEELS better. I didn’t realise how much it was actually bothering me until I did something about it.... sorry if that’s a bit much information but NOBODY talks about it because it’s considered “taboo”. How did I pay for it, I got a loan at age 23. I knew if I didn’t I would regret my sex life in my twenties.... :)"

"I had a guy ask me if women actually thought guys were attractive.

Yep, or else the human race would have gone extinct a long time ago."
"I'm male but I was physically assaulted by a manager (unprovoked, without warning and whilst I was defenceless) at work - an assault for which there was multiple witnesses.

The company not only let him get away with it, they then proceeded to engage in a campaign of bullying, threats, harassment, intimidation and smears intended to silence me and to cover-up what happened. They had me blacklisted and managed to turn everyone I knew against me. 

Everything that was done to me ended up utterly destroying my mental health and left me profoundly traumatised. I fully understand why people choose not to come forward.

Having said that, I would speak out again but that's because I know now that I can go through hell and come out alive on the other side. I'm minded of Gillian Anderson's line to Will Graham in **Hannibal**: ""The reason the traumatised are unpredictable is because we know we can survive""."
"The entire concept of pets, or more specifically how we've gone about breeding them to our weird ass specifications. "
"My boyfriend has been dying to play the new Spider-Man game on PS4. The only issue is he didn’t have either. So I decided to surprise him and buy both a ps4 and the Spider-Man game. This was about two weeks ago. He’s still constantly thanking me for gift. I love surprising him with things because he’s just so genuine. I love him. 

I’m Not saying to buy him a whole console and what not but try getting him little things to show he’s appreciated and you care. "
"Not having the house 100% spotless all the time.  I grew up with a SAHM who was obsessed with keeping the house super clean all the time, forever.  And she judged others for having cluttered homes or ones that weren't vacuumed constantly.

I'm an adult now, kind of went through a minor crisis because I didn't keep up with completely sanitizing my house every day.  But, I have figured out why people's houses may have clutter and so forth."
"Also, just look at how our president talks about unattractive women while being an unattractive man. We can use this as a good example of what the difference is. 

We have all witnessed as he calls them ""pigs"", makes fun of their faces and physical attributes while not being much to look at himself. 

A man can be unattractive and that be overlooked once the man becomes successful. A woman's looks are always used as a measure of her worth. "
"Not being yourself. My friend talks about how annoying it is that you have to put on this fake show of who you are and your new s/o can’t see the “gross” side of you too early. In my (admittedly only) serious relationship, I was myself 100% from the beginning and we lasted for 3.5 years. Stop pretending, if a person can’t deal with your weirdness/grossness/honesty, they’re not the one for you. "
One time I tore up tiny pieces of paper with things that said stuff like “you are so handsome!” “I love you” “you are the best” etc and hid them throughout the pages of his favorite book. So he could just come across them as he read and feel loved :)
"Being gay. Obviously I don't think it's a choice now, but I 100% believed it was a decision people made to live out that ""lifestyle"" when I was still very Christian. I thought it was normal for people to have attraction to the same gender, but that it was a sin to act on those desires. Then I became a teenager... you can guess the rest."
"Pregnancy. I'm ashamed to say I said, ""Oh..it can't be THAT bad...they're milking it."" Well I got my karma and then some. My first I had hyperemesis gravidarum which is basically uncontrollable morning sickness where I had to quit my job and be placed on constant IVs just to survive. At the end of my pregnancy he dropped into my pelvis a month early so I had a bowling ball just chillin at the bottom of my pelvis. Then I had this thing called prodromal labor where I literally labored an entire month. Real contractions would start and then eventually taper off. Im currently 16weeks with my second and I have a condition called a subchorionic hemorrhage that caused me to lose so much blood I almost had a transfusion. I'm so so sorry for being so awful to pregnant women before. "
"Yes. I have a friend who was in a ldr with a dude living in a different country. they had been together forever and i was a newer friend so i didn't really want to say anything, but the way he treated her rubbed me the wrong way.  He made her cry way too often during fights and I would hear stories about all of his close friendships with teen girls at his work. 

&amp;#x200B;

She did all of the work getting him to our country and on their wedding. About 9 months after the wedding he left her with a lot of debt and with claims that he was abused. to top it off he told her he was having second thoughts about the whole thing BEFORE she got him over here. "
Yup. When you're fat you aren't treated poorly per se. You are just...not there. I found that it happened with men and women. Though men it was much worse to the point of impoliteness. 
"Totally agree. And if you explain that you don't want a relationship, and you don't want a hookup they ask 'why?', as if there is some terrible reasoning behind it and that they can fix you. It's none of thier business.

I'm currently dealing with a guy who's line of thinking is that he's 'worried' about me. I should date him because time is ticking and he doesnt want me to end up alone.

Its okay, I have my crazy cat lady retirement plan all sorted...."
"Being ""honest"" or ""blunt"" in a way that's just an excuse for being an asshole.  You can be tactful and kind when being honest!"
"Having ‘no filter’. Not being able to adjust your tone or keep certain things back isn’t a virtue, it just tells me you’re an asshole with no manners or concern for others’ feelings. "
Does LASIK count? Because I’ve waited my whole life and finally saved up for it but luckily found a Groupon. I used to have 20/400 vision and now it’s probably about 20/25. Or in contact numbers I had -4.75 and -5.25. My favorite thing is going to bed and waking up and being able to see. Also when I shower now I can shave and look out for spiders 
"It's never over,

My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder

It's never over, all my riches for her smiles

When I slept so soft against her

It's never over,

All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter

It's never over,

She is the tear that hangs inside my soul forever

-Lover, You Should've Come Over by Jeff Buckley. This entire album is one of the most beautiful albums of all time."
"I hate rushing, but I love sleep. How well I’ve slept will usually dictate whether I rush or what I prioritise. I can be up at 7am, showered, dressed, breakfast, hair, teeth and makeup done, with time to spare. Or I can be up 20 minutes before I have to leave, in which case things need prioritising - aka eat something instead of wear makeup, dry shampoo and tie back hair instead of shower. "
Sounds like your brothers are just jerks. I don't know if this is a larger problem.
"Rating scales exist for a reason but they are ramantly misused (e.g. ""anything less than a ten rating counts as a negative""). You might as well just have a two point scale rather than make people grossly inflate their scores so that the service workers won't get in trouble. Not every experience is a 10/10 but that doesn't mean it's bad!"
"""I can be a bitch"". Yeah. We all can. It's not something to aspire to or brag about over a meme of the Tasmanian Devil."
"What a lot of people don’t understand is that the emotional scars from being unattractive run so deep that even if someone is being genuinely nice, you question it. Receiving a compliment becomes a double edged sword. Are they joking about my xyz looking nice? Were they just trying to say something nice? Then you become aware of the thing that they complimented, and the insecurities you have over that thing come out even though you weren’t thinking about that particular insecurity. 

For example, say someone complements my body shape. The immediate gut reaction is that its a lie. I roll my eyes and move on in conversation. But my mind sticks on it. Why could they have said that? Just to be mean? To be nice? Is the shirt I’m wearing making me look fatter than I am? Even though I wasn’t at all feeling insecure about my figure before they said something, now I instantly feel like covering myself up and hiding. 

TL;DR: Compliments just make me feel more insecure "
"Abortion. When I was a teenager I had a friend who had an abortion and I went through this emotional dilemma of still loving my friend, but still considering the decision she made very wrong. It mostly stemmed from misinformation. I wasn't religious, but I was still sort of of the opinion that life began at conception and any attempt to stop a pregnancy was murder. You shouldn't kill the baby because you made a mistake and had unprotected sex. But then I went to college and  learned about the progression of pregnancy, and realized that it doesn't even have a nervous system or a functioning brain to know/feel what's going on till a certain time, so if you're going to do it, I guess it shouldn't be considered murder to do it before X weeks. Then I got some actual life experience and realized that abortions aren't even about ""taking the easy way out"" from their mistakes. It's a painful choice either way, it's just often the better choice, over raising a child in poverty or raising a child that you know you don't want and may not ever love. There is so much more nuance to the situation than I realized. It just took outgrowing being a teenager who clearly had life all figured out. (I guess I kind of misread the title some, I didn't end up having an abortion when I changed my tune, I ended up changing my thoughts when I was about 20, and solidified them the following year when I had to make that choice myself. I ended up not having an abortion but I did consider it for various reasons and my newer beliefs on the matter helped me make an informed decision.)"
"I sometimes tell him I feel like I haven’t paid much attention to him throughout the busy week. He says he doesn’t need attention but now I realize I do need to do little things for him, just because I love him. Thank you for all the ideas."

"“I wish I didn’t know now what I didn’t know then”

"
So true. Honesty should never be used as a weapon to bludgeon the self esteem of another human being.
"It wasn't in a romantic relationship (in fact, I have and I am avoiding those until I know I've completely nipped the abusive traits in the bud), but rather in friendships.

I was reading a book on how to help victims of abuse heal -- and there was a list of traits of emotional / psychological abuse. I was thinking about how they reminded me of my abuser (my stepfather) -- and then suddenly it hit me: *I was doing the same things*, albeit in different methods from him!

I don't want to say I was mortified, because I wasn't. I didn't really feel anything. But I realized that I was becoming the same kind of monster as the one I had been mistreated by. I thought about my mother in her marriage, and how she suffered; I remembered the inner agony that my child-self had undergone until my escape. **In that moment, I decided that if I ever choose to have an SO or if I ever have children (whether biologically mine, or who I take in as my own), that I will never inflict the same torment onto them as what I had gone through.**

It's a long road of monitoring my thoughts / actions, to undo it all and re-direct my behavior to something better -- but I hope to someday be someone who can speak life and help with healing, rather than say or do destructive and soul-destroying things.

It's difficult to do, but things are already better. Friendships are deeper -- to the people I mistreated, I spoke to them and told them what I did and how it was wrong, and apologized. They help me by pointing out sharpness / harsh words when they slip free, so I can reel it in and check myself. Overall everyone is happier, and there is more peace in my life as well because of it."
"It affects my friendships with other women. Even if I'm there for them, and do all the emotional labor of a best friend, I never get that title. That goes to someone much prettier, who they can be seen with, and take pictures with. It doesn't seem like the biggest deal, but it hurts sometimes."
"I learned this while working with kids, but it's remarkably effective with adults as well (morally grey because it can be manipulative depending on situation):

In a situation where you're depending on someone to make a decision, give them two choices (both of which are beneficial for you). Most of the time people will just pick one of the choices instead of presenting an alternative that might be less desirable for me. So if I want my partner to do a chore I'm avoiding, I might say ""would you rather scoop the litterbox or empty the wastebaskets?"" Chances are he'll just pick one of those two instead of suggesting a different chore he'd rather do, whereas if I asked ""which chores are you going to do?"" he probably would suggest a chore I'd rather do myself. "
“Have you tried washing your face?” Ugh I know this one. Had super bad acne as a teen and less-bad-but still-bad adult acne. I’m not a jealous person by nature but the one thing I have always envied in other women is that amazing clear porcelain skin. To live the dream!
"I didn’t like this dude from the start. He was your typical gym bro combined with being dumb as hell. Now, nothing against fit people, obviously, but he was the „Im not training legs cause you don’t see em in the club“ type. Didn’t even complete 10th grade, no job at 22 and all that. My friend got him one in her dad’s business later on.

End of the story, he cheated on her and dumped her after two years, made her hate her body and feel like shit and ended up hitting on me two months later on a dating app. 

Fuck this dude."
"Women, taking one for the team for 200.000 years."
"I once heard through the vines that I didn't get a deserved promotion at a fast casual dining place because I didn't have the right ""look.""  
I trained nearly every manager after that and wondered why my pants size had anything to do with my ability to do my job."
"Man here, Husband, father of 3 kids ranging from age 3 to 12.  I work days, my wife works evenings.  I get home from work, run, then my wife is off.  I cook, clean, bathe, tuck-in, all of the normal day-to-day tasks.  I ask for no credit and receive none for my wife does the same thing from the morning until I get home.

It is fucking infuriating listening to story after story from my wife about her friends husbands whom are in similar situations as ours as it relates to work and children.  Ladies, it's not normal, it's not cute, it's not attractive, it's not ""boys being boys lulz.""  He is being a lazy, entitled piece of shit.  Grow up and demand better or walk. - end rant i feel better now -"
"I have to disagree. I think she and Jamey's blond heavier friend are in the same league, but Jamey was definitely WAY out of her league.

&amp;#x200B;

 Also, the character is not charming. She catfishes Jamey, cyber-bullies Veronica and lies to her best friend. It's okay because she's not attractive?"
"My wife has gone through a lot in her life. I am begging her to get councilling, because of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is super easy to offend / hurt / insult her, but I have wanted nothing for her but to see her be healthy and happy. I have let her quit her job and go to school and focus on herself. I have sent her on vacations with her family in hopes she would turn a corner. I am really struggling to find a way to get her to a councilor. I have called the councilors myself, but I still can't get her to go. This has been going on for more than a year, I have mentioned it weekly and now I am at daily.   


I wish she would see I am not her enemy. "
"My ex had parents that were super religious, and he constantly tried to make me go to church with them, even though he knew I'm not Christian, like, at ALL lol. His parents didn't like me to begin with, but he always tried to get me to change for *them*, so it would be easier on him. Besides the church thing, they would always try and make me say grace before dinner, if we were at their place, and then they would go around saying individual prayers, which they also tried to make me do. I mean, it's fine if you're religious, but don't force it onto other people, you know? I didn't invite them to my place and make them sit down while I read their Tarot and opened communication with my gods and ancestors. Why should I be forced into their beliefs?

Besides that, his mom thought that I was extremely rude...because I had a cell phone. I'm not joking. His parents lived in a wooded area with lots of hills and sharp turns, so in the winter, if the roads were bad, and my boyfriend and I were over for dinner, I would text my mom telling her that we got there fine, because she wanted to know. Well, his mom thought it was the rudest thing *ever* that I was texting in *her presence*, which she told my ex, and then he told me, and literally tried to stop me, an adult, from texting my own mother.

My favorite, though, was when my ex would tell me, frequently, just how *much* his parents didn't like me, and he'd always say things like, ""well couldn't you just play along? Couldn't you leave your phone at home? Couldn't you just not voice your opinion on certain things?"" (His parents were also homophobic). No, no, I can't, because I'm an adult, and I'm not going to change into this bizzaro facsimile of an unassuming housewife to please your uber religious parents who refer to themselves as Mrs. and Mr. Literally. His dad would get home from work, and his mom would say stuff like, ""How was your day, Mr. Smith?"" Then, he would say, ""Work was fine. How was xxx Mrs. Smith?"" (Their last names aren't Smith but, you get the picture). It wasn't even in a cute ""we're married so let me lovingly call you Mr. X because I love you and love being married to you,"" type of way either! It was just this weird like, ""we're married and we still think it's the 1950's and I don't even know if we like each other let alone love each other but we're married anyway so this is how you do marriage, right?"" type of thing.

They also blamed me for everything too. I think they hated me because I was dating their youngest son, so they felt like they had to be super protective over him, even though he was an adult too. For example, he started smoking weed which, whatever. I don't smoke or drink really, because it's just not my kind of thing, but they blamed it on me because...I don't even know. Because they could, I guess. We literally had to have a ""family meeting,"" and it was basically just them telling me that I was ruining his life. I said, ""listen, we're both adults, I'm a librarian and an archivist. Your son is a 'musician' who has never had any real type of job in his life. I'm in bed by 9:30 pm. His sets don't start until 10:00 pm or later. What he does with his own time is on him."" 

Needless to say, his parents were the main reason why we broke up. "
"I hate rushing. I'm up by 5 latest. Meditation, brief yoga routine, shower, go over my planner, dress, hair, makeup, prep lunch and dinner before starting breakfast. Then my daughter is up for breakfast. We eat and play till it's time for me to leave. I factor in the time it takes to change a tire to my drive time so I usually have 20 minutes to read and enjoy a cup of tea before work once I'm there."
"Very short version: she started as 'the other girl'. He had a girlfriend but 'they truly loved each other' (my friend and him). I told her not to trust him; that it's *never* a good idea if you're the other girl.

He left his girlfriend for her and they got steady. Almost a year into the relationship she finds out that he's been cheating pretty much since day 1."
"How many cats I have. I’m single. I told him I use to have a lot, but now only have 9. (I have no pets) "
"We're in the middle of it right now actually. Fiancee lost her job and her mental health has kind of spiraled. We're working our way out of it together.

Edit: she just called me so excited and got a job offer today! She’s accepting and starts 10/4. Maybe things are looking up!"
How showing loyalty and interest in commitment is seen as a faux pas. [This article sums it up!](https://medium.com/matter/against-chill-930dfb60a577)
"I've noticed that I can't really vent about it when I'm feeling particularly down about it. A friend brings up how it's hard to be so pretty and nobody bats an eye and sympathises with her, but if I make the slightest reference to knowing that I'll never be a headturner, or speak realistically about my looks, people immediately jump in to reassure me that I'm beautiful, that they wish they had x feature of mine, etc. 

It feels fake and forced to me. I know full well what's in the mirror; you don't need to try to make me feel better and make me think that I'll see Mila Kunis in it one day!"
"Oh man, when I worked at Walgreens, they encouraged us to capture all the “red zone” sales (i.e., cosmetics and personal hygiene) in the cosmetics department. 

So one particularly slow day I’ve got my eye on a dude buying razors. I let him know that whenever he’s ready, I’d be happy to ring him up at the cosmetics counter. He shrugs and says “Yeah, okay, thanks.”

A couple of minutes later I see him headed up to the front, and i said, “Hey, man, I can ring you up here if you want,” and he ACTUALLY looks me up and down, sneers, and says, “Seriously. No, thank you.”

For the entire rest of my time there, I was too paranoid to ring up guys unless they were with a girl! (I definitely felt a little insulted. He wasn’t even cute. Pfft.)"
This is kind of a dating problem. I wish I could ask a co worker or anyone to get food sometime without it seeming like I'm trying to date or hook up with them. I just wanna hang out with someone and not go to a restaurant alone.
"So, she's done terrible things to me, but the most egregious incident I witnessed from my mother was what she said to my sister at her wedding. Our mother *loves* to be the centre of attention, and can't handle it when people aren't giving her their undivided attention, no matter the situation.

The situation for this story; my sister's *wedding*. She's a gorgeous gal but hair &amp; makeup knocked it out of the park on her. Had the usual last-minute panics (shoes weren't right, last minute skin flare up from stress; mom's solution was to have a very loud, very audible panic, I hauled ass to put out the damn fires.) So, mom is feeling crap that the crises were averted to begin with (less drama for her to wrap around herself).

Sis walks into the room before the ceremony. She's a fucking knockout. *Everyone's* telling her how beautiful she looks (like, it's her wedding so obvs. this is going to happen but she was legit fabulous), she's a gorgeous bride, how awesome her dress is, hair, makeup, oh those *shoes*!

Sis gives a shout out to me ""oh yeah, Thraell found them literally last night and they're the perfect fit, and they're like 5 inch spike heels but they're so comfy!""

Another compliment to her about how great she looks. Then our mom chimes in.

""Yeah, it's just a pity that her eye wrinkles have started so early. Our family usually has such good genetics for wrinkles"".

It's a full record scratch moment for everyone to look at who TF this \[word disallowed by AW rules\] is, and why would she say such an awful thing to a *bride*. On her *wedding day*? 

And of course, it just fucking destroys my sis because this woman couldn't STFU for one day, just *one* day. Just one day let it be about someone else, to just be happy, to just let other people be happy but no. She ended up crying after the reception because it was just this massive sledgehammer that she couldn't even have her wedding day free of this shit."
People seem to think that it's easy for women to get laid.  I'm sure it is if you're pretty or even average looking.  Not so much if you're ugly.  Dry spells suck.
"I hated my friends boyfriend from the moment I met him. I just found him a selfish, insufferable, jackass with a temper. I thought his friends were racist idiots, who didn't have a lot of respect for women. 

After dating for 6 years, they divorced after 11 months of marriage, because he developed a cocaine addiction, wracked up $40K in debt in 11 months of marriage, stole $10K from her pre-marriage investment accounts, began dealing coke, and had an affair with the secretary.  He hired a friend to dry wall the basement, but the drywall was stolen; she's pretty sure that he gave the guy cash, and he never purchased the material but claimed it was stolen. She thinks her ex was either trying to pay down debts or hide money from her. 

Love her new fiancé though! "
"On the flip side, I hate the expectation that I should be glued to my phone having a non-stop conversation with someone if they're texting me.

I wanna be able to do something while having a casual chat on the side. That might mean I reply every 30 mins or so, because I'm not a great multi-tasker. (Can't pay attention to a movie if I'm talking to someone) I've been accused of ""playing games"" just because I don't want to text back immediately."
"At 16, a boyfriend of a few months told me he wasn't comfortable with me hanging out with my guy friends without him there.

"I never understood the Skylar hate. She's not acting cantankerous just to be difficult; she's noticing a change in her increasingly absent husband and being constantly brushed off. Sure, we as the audience might find Walter ""bad ass"", but he's not. He's really not."
"I once went out with a guy who said to me one day that just before we started going out he had a choice whether or not to go out with me or someone who was “better looking”. He proudly told me that “even though I wasn’t as pretty” he “chose” me anyway. The hole was dug further as he went on to say that one of his friends had asked why he had chosen me and not the other because she was prettier, to which he had apparently replied that he just liked me better. We’re no longer together however I still bump into him from time to time, he still doesn’t get why this is an insult.

Edit: grammar"

"He'd come onto me or subtly assert his dominance over me either physically or in conversation. I told her he was bad news but of course everything he did was super deniable/open to multiple interpretations and she's *in love*. Six months later what a surprise he's cheating and also """"""dominating"""""" the relationship. Eventually she moved on and got herself together and I'm super proud of her. Her new boyfriend is weird but not in any objectionable way so I'm happy for her."
"Oh my gosh the number of times I've seen people referring to the father of the child and saying he's ""babysitting"". No motherfuckers, he's being a parent. No one ever says the mom is ""babysitting"". It kills me. "
"So I haven’t had breast reduction but I’m speaking as a new mom who is formula feeding. If reducing your breast size is going to increase your quality of life, do not worry about how you’ll fed your future baby. I thought I wanted to breastfeed but it didn’t work out. And at the end of the day, fed is best. Formula today is high quality and it definitely has its benefits in that your partner can feed the baby as well. Bonding can still occur since you can always go skin to skin when giving baby a bottle. I also found out in this process that both myself and my husband were formula fed as babies. As far as I know, we’re perfectly healthy, well adjusted adults, which is the ultimate parenting goal. "
"I watched that movie yesterday, and I couldn’t get past how everyone made such a big deal about how obviously horrible-looking the Sierra character was. I just didn’t see it.

I mean, no women look their best in a marching band uniform, and her nose was a little round, but considering that this was supposed to be the Cyrano de Bergerac story... no way. The actress is cute, the character was charming, and I just don’t buy that that boy was light years out of her league. She was just a normal-looking young woman. Not a supermodel, but also not ugly.

I can’t decide if this was Hollywood being out of touch, in that normal-to-cute for life is monstrously ugly for an actress, or if this was Hollywood being very realistic, in that so many perfectly cute teenage girls think that their lives are not worth living because they aren’t beautiful enough. Either way, I had trouble enjoying the movie, just from that one bit of dissonance."
"He would tell me to wear makeup if I was gonna leave the house. Cuz my bare face was ‘disgusting’. He would try to tell me what to wear, not wanting me to wear certain clothes or dresses. We moved really far (and way too soon) from everyone I knew.

"&gt; ""universal shared experience

Preach! I didn't lose my virginity until later in life, and during that time I watched this british documentary of this middle-aged woman on a mission to lose her virginity. She hired a male escort and did the deed. Afterwards she said she felt like she just ""joined the human race"". 

Honestly, it's such a marginalizing feeling when you haven't accomplished a basic thing that ""everybody else"" has done. "

"First off, sorry you have to deal with such crap.

&gt; ""you don't have any actual women in this major, because they don't take care of themselves '

I think there *is* a perception, right or wrong, that physically unattractive women don't *have* to be unattractive, but choose to not make an effort to be more attractive.  Guys get a bit of the same, but it is communicated differently.

For women, it's basically lose some weight, dress fashionably and wear make-up.  In other words, the self-improvement is all about physical appearance.

For men, it is generally directed at the 20-something ""neckbeard"" who plays video games all day and lives in his mom's basement.  No one is telling a 40 year old dude how to become more attractive.  And while the ""neckbeard"" does get some physical appearance advice about hitting the gym and no wearing cargo shorts, there is an added layer of ""be an interesting person"" that physically unattractive women don't hear."

"The pet thing is false.

Here's how it works...

They can't read humans, but humans obviously can. But humans like to second-guess our own instincts. Probably because we like to apply logic to things. So if a person makes us uncomfortable we actually train ourselves to ignore it.

Pets can't read people but they *can* read their owners. Probably because they grew up around them.

When a pet is reacting negatively to a new person they're actually reacting to their owners discomfort. They're reading *you* not the other person.

If you need a source I can't link anything because I read this in the book The Gift of Fear. I highly recommend the book by the way. It's great. And it's especially something great for women to read."

"I have a friend who has had more than one guy with that porn fantasy try to talk her into it. She quickly found that the response of ""Only if I get to peg you first"" helped put a stop to that shit right quick. I asked her what she'd do if a guy agreed to it and she said ""You know what? At that point at least he's willing to compromise, so he's earned it."""
"Society expects both to have fewer partners, but men generally run the risk of being seen as creepy, whereas women tend to be seen as sloppy/in need of a makeover etc, so it's generally the womans fault. Both genders face some pretty polarizing situations and neither is really better.

Granted what's attractive or not is subjective and a lot can be done by dressing well/staying healthy/grooming etc."
"On a dating site: 'I see you have kids...did you get stitched up after the birth, or is it still ruined?'.

It will always be ruined to you, you sack of dog shit."
"Piggybacking off of that, there’s a lot of ~conventional wisdom~ floating around that states that men find *all women* attractive, or that men always secretly want to fuck *all* their female friends. A lot of discussions about gender issues even in socially aware spaces kind of piggyback off of this idea, too. Like, sometimes people talk about rejection as if it were an issue of male entitlement. 

Like, I like to think that maybe I’ve never been catcalled or that I’ve never had a male friend try to have sex with me because I’m just around a lot of truly great men. But it’s supposed to happen to all women, right? And that often calls into question *just how undesirable* I must be. "
"There was a great video about masculinity as it’s represented in [Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them](https://youtu.be/C4kuR1gyOeQ). Whether you like the movie or not, it’s very interesting how the movie’s male lead was presented as a kind and caring man. And the writers were criticized for it, because Newt didn’t fit the parameters of what a male lead was supposed to be (womanizer, macho, uncaring, take-charge, etc). "
"I once worked for a store right outside an enormous U.S. military base, which made for tons of interesting deliveries. Soldiers usually tipped well, and it was a glimpse into a place I never would have seen otherwise. My favorite one happened around midnight one evening last August. 

My boss hands me a huge stack of pizzas, around 100$ worth, and gives me some VERY specific directions: ""They're on X Street, but when you get to Y Street, call them and turn your headlights off until you get there."" Uhh, what? (Apparently these guys were regulars, and ordering food was against the rules for them. But since their money was good, and it wasn't illegal for US, we did it!) 

So I turned off the main road, cut my headlights, and called them. A guy picks up, and starts whispering exact directions to me, and probably asks me three times if my lights are off (yes, yeesh). After two minutes, I get to a small building, and see two uniformed dudes speedwalking toward the curb. I hand them all of their stuff through my window, get a fistful of cash, and they take off. Got tipped around 20 bucks and felt like I was sticking it to the man!"
That guy deserves crumbs in his bed. 
"What always surprises me is how *angry* people get when a woman isn’t presenting in a way they consider to be attractive, like women somehow owe it to them to conform to their ideas of attractiveness. (And it’s not like it’s even remotely possible, given how many standards of beauty there are, so that just adds another layer of ridiculousness.) It’s not just that they don’t want to engage romantically, they’re offended and sometimes violently angry.

I haven’t ever seen or heard of the same thing happening to men on a broad scale, which is why I mention it, but I certainly could be wrong."

"Absolutely no offense taken, I don’t mind questions about it at all. :) (this got incredibly long sorry)

I’m going to try to explain my thought process as best I can. Keep in mind however that I’m not a scholar, nor am I saying everyone should adopt my way of thinking amd anyone is welcome to disagree and draw their own consequences for their own life.

I believe any “restrictions” placed on women (or muslims in general, really) in Qur’an and by Islam ultimately have the goal to protect us. From others and from ourselves, not just a mean to spoil our fun. I also believe Qur’an encourages muslims to reflect and think about the meaning Qur’an, rather than taking it at face value. This in my opinion is apparent by multiple different verses, but also merely by the poetic way Qu’ran is written and by the language that God chose to write it in. I also believe that said meaning changes over time, which makes sense to me because I figure the only way for a text to remain applicable and relevant for billions across time amd space is if it is able to adapt to different perspectives. 

When it comes to interfaith marriage Qur’an provides two things. The admissibility of a marriage between a muslim man and a christian/jewish woman, and the inadmissability of arranging a marriage between a non-muslim man and your daughter. For me two things are a factor here: for one, God doesn’t address women directly but their guardians. To me, this offers room for the assumption that Qur’an means to protect young women from becoming political pawns to achieve piece with the other politicised religious groups from the time when Qur’an was written. This is something done to this day in multiple contexts, religious and non-religious alike, where families basically gift their daughters to rivals and enemies in order to form alliances or gain good-will. More importantly for me though: why does Qur’an permit men to marry a jewish/christian woman, but not the other way around? I believe as with all gender specific rulings, it’s with the goal to protect. From what? Christianism and Judaism, though very alike in many regards, treat women (especially married ones) very different from Islam. There are different rulings regarding divorce, responsibilities and rights of a wife etc.. The right to work, the right to divorce, the right to be treated well-or-else-I-owe-you-nada were introduced by Islam. Christianism and Judaism in their original form were much less favorable for women. I think Qur’an therefore didn’t extend the same carte “blanche” to women as it did to men, who weren’t at risk of being oppressed by a christian/jewish wife. 

This is still relevant in many, many societies today, no doubt. But for us? My SO is christian but he does not expect me to adopt a christian mindset as his wife. He does not ever comprimise my values, he enriches them. He encourages me in pursuit of islamic values, even though he doesn’t share them, because he respects my choices and belief. He doesn’t have an issue with our son learning about Islam. He is one of the kindest, most generous, patient and forgiving people I have ever known. He inspires me to do and be better everyday. Yeah, he doesn’t fast the same days I do, he doesn’t pray like I do. But he still humbles himself in front of God everyday and reflects his actions by the merit of believing in something higher and wiser than himself. He isn’t a muslim but he incorporates everything Islam highlights as the most important and makes me a better muslim despite him not being one. 

To me this means that this ruling ceases to be applicable to us, because the connotations are not the same. Similarily to how Qur’an doesn’t permit for women to travel alone, but the context of that was a woman riding through the desert on a camel at the mery of bandits and rapists in probably the most misogynistic society of all time. Not exactly comparable to me hopping on a train, while constantly being connected to my friends and family via my cellphone, in a country with a in comparison next to nonexistent crime rate. Or how plucking my eyebrows may have had connotation to prostitution in the prophets time, but surely doesn’t today. So yes, I hope our marriage is lawful. If turns out on the day of judgement that it isn’t I hope that God forgives us by the merit of our best intentions. "

My co worker had her right breast removed due to cancer...they did reconstructive surgery that did NOT go well....her whole right side is sunken in and scarred. During all this going on her husband started cheating on her. They divorced. She was 45 and thought she would never find anyone to love her. Then one day a man walked into our work and they hit it off. She just turned 50 yesterday...celebrating 3 years with her new man who looks at her like she is an absolute goddess! This man worships the ground she walks on scars and all. You will find your value again..dont give up!!

"“Benchwarming.” When you like someone but that person is keeping you on the side just in case someone better comes along or for some other reason. You guys will still do couple-y things together and may seem like you’re dating but there’s no actual label in case the other person wants to back out anytime. And you can’t say anything or get mad because you guys were never a thing to begin with. And after the “relationship” you can’t even call them your ex so it’s always “some person i used to talk to.” 

This kind of situation hurt me and made me feel like my emotions weren’t valid because i was “not supposed to have them.” "

"When I was in high school we had one male employee at my job that none of my coworkers liked closing the store with, and I never got it.

I eventually found out that it was because he was sexually harassing literally everyone but me, so they didn't feel comfortable being alone in the store with him after closing. It's a shitty feeling: like, obviously I don't want to be sexually harassed or feel unsafe around a coworker, but at the same time, I'm so ugly even the workplace creep isn't interested? Damn."

"I was young when I had my surgery, 30. I did not have a choice as I had cervical cancer. I did not have biological children but was at peace with my decision. I was a little freaked out initially to have it done knowing I would never be able to have biological children but I knew it was because I was no longer in control and not necessarily because I wanted them. I have 2 beautiful adopted children, one we adopted before we knew I had cancer because I always wanted to adopt and never had an urge to be pregnant. I will say the surgery it self carried issues for me. I had mine done with the davinci machine, laparoscopy. After 8 weeks I developed an unbearable pain in my abdomen and ended up back in the hospital for a week with the doctors not sure what was going on. They gave me antibiotics and discharged me when the pain subsided. This happened one more time before they decided to preform exploratory surgery in which they found my cervical cuff was necrotic where the suture had dehisced. I had abdominal fluid leaking from there for months and they just thought it was an infection and seroma. Here is what I will say to be very careful of- if your surgeon is using the davinci machine make sure they have preformed this surgery over 200 times. They sell this machine to surgeons, show them how to use it around 10 times on swine and we are basically guinea pigs. Dehiscence is a major problem with surgeons who aren't well trained with this machine and there are law suits going on currently because of it. Research your doctor and ask a lot of questions. Once everything was healed and back to normal it was the best thing that has ever happened to me. I don't miss periods at all and sex for me is better than before!"

"When I went on the first date with my boyfriend, it was a disaster. We met on a dating app. The conversation wasn't great, but we didn't have a lot of options so we both took a risk on it.

I canceled on him twice due to work. It got postponed. It got postponed again. When we finally went to meet up for coffee, the coffee place was closed, then so was the second one we went to. We arrived at a book store the second it closed. 

Ever have a date where it feels like you're both super nervous and everything is unraveling? It was like that. It was for sure crashing.

What pulled it back? He had enough sense to say ""hey, I was gonna go to a concert after our date - uh, it's metal. But... uh. You can come with me?"" And I said sure, even though it was so not my scene.

We had a drink, our nerves faded, and in no time we were talking, and laughing, and enjoying the music. We walked for hours after and just, talked. About everything. 

It's been almost four months and I still think he's the best thing. "

"I hadn't heard from her for a few days and so I called her up and found out that she had met this dude at a wedding. In four days they had taken a trip together and he had already introduced her to his kid. Moving so fast is kind of a red flag for me but whatever, she just got out of a life sucking relationship and she couldn't stop raving about how great this guy was. Sometimes this happens.

I met him and while I tried to play nice the guy gave me a bad taste in my mouth. Everything he did was subtle and I couldn't explain to you why I didn't like him but a bunch of little things, like how easily offended he was and how mean he could be under guise of, ""it's just a joke!""

She got pregnant a few months in and that's about when all hell broke loose. At first they both seemed thrilled but after a while he started accusing her of hanging out with other men and he ripped doors off the hinges when he was mad. He called her a whore and a slut and said that if she was so quick to get knocked up maybe the baby wasn't even his. He left her to walk home on the side of the road as punishment for claiming  to have seen her with other men and then suddenly he just kicked her out. I helped her pack her stuff up and saw that he had written down all his insults and hung them up like it was something to be proud of.

She and I don't really talk anymore but last I heard the kid is doing fine and her and the dad don't seem to have much contact. I hope she's doing well"
"I don't know about lesser known, but job opportunities are very slim when you aren't attractive. Many prospective employers will overlook clients due to not finding them attractive. It's not necessarily malicious, part of the issue is that in their brain you just don't stand out.

My Mom went through this, but it was worse than just being overlooked for a job. She has always been interested in accounting and numbers, so 20ish years ago she decided to get her certificate in accounting. The school promised career services if she would finish the year of courses. Thousands of dollars in loans later, she was done and excited to meet with the career advisor. She was looking forward to having some good career options to help support our family.

This advisor proceeded to sit her down and explain to her that there was no way he could place her. She was too ugly and no one would want to hire her as any kind of assistant. I'm unsure of the actual conversation as I was too young, but I know that specifics about her appearance, particularly her weight, were used.

My Mom left in tears and came home broken. She received a promotion at her current job to front office and now basically runs the entire place. The only time she left was the few years she ran my Dad's business before he was diagnosed with cancer. When he was unable to work anymore, she went right back to the same place because she knew that she was valued.

I didn't find out anything about this until I was an adult, but this is one of the many stories my Mom suffered through that still piss me off to this day."
"*Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.* It helped me realize that love is not enough. There is a lot more to a successful relationship than love.

One of these reasons it affected me so much is because my boyfriend at the time had a *very* different response to it. I saw the movie as these two incompatible people trapped in misery because they were hopelessly attracted to each other and lacked the willpower to pull away, despite their best efforts (like getting their memories erased). My partner saw as this romantic affirmation that fighting, sadness, loneliness, etc., were the price of true love, and that love is worth overcoming *any* obstacle, even if the relationship itself is the obstacle.

Our differences in interpretation concerned me a bit. Turns out they should have concerned me a *lot* more. When the relationship became abusive and all I wanted to do was never wake up, he *still* would not let me go. He thought our relationship was worth saving even if it killed me or him. He stalked me, threatened me, tried to kill himself, *everything* he could to keep me close."
"I had a fuckboy say basically the same when I was bedridden with the flu.  I was astounded because - in what universe would being his fuckpuppet be nothing?

He didn't ask me if I was okay,  if I needed anything,  to text him when I felt better so we could bang - no.  He expected me to put not only my comfort and consent aside but also my health for his orgasm. It was so dehumanizing.

She had quite some difficult time with her family, particularly her father. Her American mom converted to Muslim when she married her dad, who seems to be the more traditional and headstrong one. "
"That men (I guess women can do this too but I only date men so my experience is limited) seem to think it’s ok to ask you if they can fuck you in the ass as an opener. This happens to me all the time on dating apps and I just comes off as so gross when men lay out all their kinks before the first date and they justify it as transparency. Like, I dunno, maybe I would let you rub your dick on the bottom of my feet but maybe wait until a few dates in to ask! "
"He wouldn’t go down on me unless I was waxed. 
I keep everything trimmed, by no means a bush. So it was hurtful to see that my partner didn’t enjoy it at all when I was anywhere near natural. I realize now it’s just preference, but for a long time I spent money and time worrying about something I didn’t need to.

I was more of an introvert than my normal extrovert.
For awhile I took him on all my trips and made plans, but after he got comfortable he declined more and more. At the time I felt an obligation to stay home with a partner with depression, but I realize now that I missed out on so many opportunities for someone who wouldn’t make those same sacrifices as me.

He didn’t intentionally do these things to hurt me or try to change me. But I guess those are the things you gotta watch out for huh? "
Successful women are attacked both for being ugly and for being pretty. There is no winning.
I think I'm an average looking person but I *always* gravitate towards more unattractive people because for some reason I feel like they're nicer and they are way less intimidating. Idk maybe I'm an outlier?
"That's why I'm so pro choice. It's not for me to make anyone's decision for them. 

It's also why I'm so pro real sex education and pro free long lasting birth control (proven to lower the abortion rate, and improve the lives of young women (finishing HS, getting a job, staying off of welfare programs, not having a child until marriage)).

Really don't understand why everyone can't get on board with this. "
"Chocolate does *not* belong in the fridge.

My boyfriend always, without fail, puts his chocolate bars in the fridge, while I like mine room-temperature and a little melty.  To me, a cold chocolate bar doesn't taste anywhere near as good; it's just a frigid hunk of disappointment."
"""Out in the garden where we planted the seeds, there is a tree as old as me, branches were sewn by the color of green, ground had arose and past its knees, by the cracks of its skin, I climbed to the top; I climbed a tree to see the world.

"I still don't understand it. I can't think of a single circumstance where someone would rather you just ignore them forever instead of explaining you aren't interesred in moving forward. It just feels wrong. Everyone wants closure, but so few are willing to actually give it to others."
"Not at all.  My daughter is more worldly and self-aware than I ever was.  She's physically more fit and beautiful, and she knows herself.  I was sheltered and made poor decisions out of immaturity.  She is who I always wished I could be."
"THIS. So much yes. I work with a lady like this. It’s always exhaustion, how busy she was, bad day. You’re tired? Oh well I stayed up this late doing blah blah blah. You’re busy? Oh well I have to take my kids to 16 different places. Oh something terrible happened to you? Well let me tell you about how I had an experience that was so much worse than yours. 

Even to the point of when I say “ok I can’t hold it anymore, gonna run to the bathroom real quick”- she says “oh well can you go for me too while you’re up there?” Just so catty. Shut up and go to the freakin bathroom 

ETA: ok this feels good so while I’m on this rant let me add- while her husband is on a work trip she always says she is a “single parent” for that week. It drives me crazy. Like no lady you are not a single parent. You still have 2 incomes, a huge house, brand new car, your husband is only a phone call away. (Not saying single parents can’t have plenty of money or nice things but you get what I mean). My mom was actually a single mom and busted her ass and we struggled but we made it. She has no clue what real single parents actually go thru."
"Sometime in college. I listened to a lot of comedy on a high school trip to Europe and it shaped the way I deliver punchlines and jokes. I've always been clever, but once I got that college 'please kill me because I don't want to student anymore' attitude, it seemed to resonate with people more. 

My mom also started doing stand up comedy around this time and I became her joke editor/ghost writer. She's been doing it for 9 years now, and has finally convinced me to write my own jokes. My coworkers are always telling me how funny I am, so I've been built up on this wave of confidence and I'm willing to give it a shot.

"I get up at 7.30am. Get dressed, brush my teeth, sort my hair and put in contact lenses. Have a bit of time to browse Reddit. I leave the house at 8.05am, walk to the bus stop and catch the 8.15am. I usually arrive at my bus stop at 8.50 or so and there's a 5 minute walk to my office.

"On the bus where a teenager around 14-15 years old came in without their bus card. I had seen them on this exact same bus every single morning all summer, so I assume this was their transport to a summer job. Undoubtedly the old bus driver that drives this route every day would have recognized him also.

Well, the kid was honest and told the bus driver he had forgotten his card but was hoping it would be okay just this once, seeing as they saw each other every day and he had always had it with him previously. This bus driver laid down the law on this poor kid saying there was nothing he could do, he would absolutely not let him on without a ticket. He was trying to shoo the kid out when a kind stranger on the bus got an extra ticket out of their wallet and handed it forward, explaining that she'd be happy to pay for this one. Oh the bus driver didn't think so, oh no! He started yelling at this lady saying that it was absolutely not acceptable to pay for someone else on the bus(???) and it was the kid's own fault that they didn't have a ticket. He was on the verge of escorting the stranger off the bus along with the boy when other passengers spoke up and told him how ridiculous his behavior was. He eventually let the kid on but of course only after accepting the ticket given by the kind passenger. Never in my life have I seen someone act so high and mighty about something so utterly unimportant."
"I went through a period of psychological upheaval in my mid-twenties for this exact reason. Nobody is going to remember me after I die. I am not going to make any substantial difference in the world. I am never going to be a tortured genius who sits in a darkened room, churning out literary masterpieces while forgetting to eat.

This *really* upset me for a while. Then I decided, ""fuck it"". I'm on this planet. I'm going to make the most of it. I'm going to have an attractive flat with leafy plants and paintings by Degas, I'm going to get a cat, I'm going to get drunk and eat artisanal cheese and I'm going to have freaky sex with my boyfriend. And then I'm going to die, and that's fine because I had a fucking good time."

"Fun story of how I was treated:
Middle school they always had dances one the weekends at the YMCA. My friends were more popular with guys so I usually ended up alone, a lot. Especially if slow songs come on. When one did, I found myself alone again and decided to sit on the side lines in the basketball room they had the dances in. Two boys about the same age as me came up and asked to dance, and I could pick either one.. I said no but they persisted so I decided why not. The boy I danced with kept me at arms reach, like his arms were stiff as a board, and kept them on my shoulders, and completely avoided eye contact. After the song was over, before I could even say ""thanks"" the boy bailed and ran to his friend and I overheard him say ""EW it was so disgusting! You owe me 20$! Yuck!"". Never went to a dance again. No prom. Nothing. Lol I was fat and a ugly nerdy ginger so. Yeay me. "
"You get along and respect each other's choices.  Don't cause unnecessary strife.


This doesn't mean you hang out or even like your sibling, but if you can be polite and get along with them at family functions, I'm gonna go ahead and say it's healthy.  


For the sibling I get along best with, we talk multiple times a week even if it's only texting or snapchat, we hang out, do stuff together.  Talk to each other about anything with minimum judgement.  We're planning on getting matching tattoos sometime in the near future"
"My SO’s catholic, I’m muslim. Not sure what you’re specifically curious about, so please ask away.
Long story short, my SO and I have different religious, ethnic and cultural backgrounds. We discussed our differences openly early on, our families minded their business for the most part, and we’re handling it well, though it has at times become more difficult to navigate with our son in the picture (I’m pregnant, first baby, we obviously had very different upbringings and people are opinionated when it comes to kids). "
"I have to agree with this. It's one thing if you're Brett Favre. He got paid millions of dollars and it was his job. If you're running on a strained ACL to compete in a Tough Mudder, you're just causing yourself long-term damage for a literal moment of recognition. "
"Obesity.  I don't think people should be fat-shamed (and studies show it doesn't help people lose weight) but I also don't think we should celebrate people who are morbidly obese as somehow being ""brave"" or ""not caring what the haters think!"".  

If you want to believe you're the sexiest thing on two legs then that's fine, but that doesn't stop obesity from exacerbating a myriad of health issues, and it isn't something that should be celebrated."
An insane amount. It’ll stop bothering me the day I hear as many men told to smile as women. Just don’t police other people’s faces ffs.
"an overweight man has to be overtly obese before he gets shit on because of his weight. a woman might already be ''fat'' at either average weight or just a few pounds over, and a ''hamplanet'' or other dehumanizing term at the level of obese that men start getting called ''fat''."

"Guy here. I’ve had that question in my head for a long time. Luckily I didn’t have to ask. A friend got a reduction and lift and after a month she said to me “thank god. My back doesn’t hurt as much anymore.” 

I looked at her. The hanpster wheel started spinning. Put 2 and 2 together. Said awesome and offered a high five"
"When an unattractive man can't find a woman, people usually say it's the woman's fault for not taking pity on him. When an unattractive woman can't find a man, people will instead think there is something wrong with the woman because the man doesn't want her. How often do you see films where the unattractive woman gets with a hot guy, as compared to an ugly guy with a hot woman?!"
"I was the friend. The one who lost herself for a man that didn't deserve her. I miss you, too. Even when I was still with him, I would think of you and smile."
"I agree and as I got older realized that's one of the many things my parents did right. I'm the youngest and have an older brother and an older sister. Even though we did a lot of the same stuff that we could have been competitive over like track and soccer, I never felt the need to compare myself to my brother or sister like that. 

My parents had this amazing ability to make you feel special when you accomplished something but also not make you feel bad if it wasn't your time to shine. 

As a result I have a really good relationship with both my siblings. We went through the typical phases of hating each other when we were at awkward ages, but the way we were raised to not compete and compare really helped us as adults. 

We're able to trust each other, be honest with each other, and genuinely root for each other's success. Now we all live within a mile of each other and have a lot of the same friends.  "

"My best friend and I both did some stupid shit. Moral of my story is that if you don’t like the guy just tell your friend. 

So we met in college and instantly became friends. Did everything together for months. Then in comes her new boyfriend, who breaks up with her after 2 weeks. I was comforting her and we were hanging out when he called the next day and wanted to get back together. There started their 4 year relationship. I never told her but I thought he was crap, lazy, stupid, everything was his way or the highway. 

Enter my new boyfriend about a month after she has starting dating her boyfriend. My man was an asshole to everyone, and I was embarrassed to bring him around my friends but I stayed. We were together for 5 years. 

My friend and I saw each other off and on in those few years, drifting every time our boyfriends got in the way but never talking to each other about the problems we saw. We both finished school, I got married, and we both found good jobs. After being married for a year and a half I got divorced and her and I started hanging out once a week again. We finally admitted to each other all the things we hated about our respective boyfriends, and both realized we should have stood up to each other more way earlier on. Being back together after we ended our toxic relationships has really helped both of us grow and be better though. "
"In a friendship, yes, but not a romantic relationship. The distinction doesn't matter to me, I was a piece of shit to her. It took her asking me to stop to stop, and even now like...18 years later (this happened in the sixth grade), I feel awful about it. As I should. Our friendship continued on for years after I stopped it, though, and eventually fell apart for other reasons."

"I married the only man I ever consented to sex with. I feel great about it—he treats me well and I never felt the need to explore, so I didn’t. "
"Sure. 

I only pay for coffee about half of the time. Doors are almost always opened for me. Discounts are offered. People go out of their way to help you, whereas when you’re fat they outright ignore you.  Meals are paid for sometimes. Men offer to let you cut in line. Just straight up offer. It’s easier to find a job. In HS I was told I was hired because she liked having pretty employees. People just treat you better.

The differences are small. Like I said, I didn’t realize I got all these “perks” until I lost them and then got them back again. 

Also, when I was heavy, people would OFTEN comment on my body and what I was eating. They have no problem being cruel to you under the guise of concern. No one makes a peep when I buy a donut nowadays. "
"I've heard this theory, and it's based on research from the ""pulled it out of my arse"" Institute, but I think it's interesting.

The theory is that homophobic people who believe that ""homosexuality is a choice"" believe this because of their own sexuality. Because *they* experience homosexual urges, they assume *everyone* does - but whether or not you *act* on them is a function of whether you have self-control and a good moral compass. So anyone who does act on those feelings is simply a degenerate with poor impulse control. See also: ""drug addicts *choose* to be addicted to drugs"" etc.

Obviously lots of homophobes are just trash straight people, but I think it could be a valid explanation in some cases."
"Yep. It's like they think they have some ethical free pass to be horrible to other people because it's their honest opinion.

I've noticed a couple of related things about people who say this. First, they seem to think their opinions are some kind of objective truth and that they're doing the world a favor by being ""brutally honest."" They never *own* their opinions. They're not just being brutally honest about their personal feelings, they're forcing some imagined 'truth' onto others.

Secondly, people I've known like this absolutely cannot handle any criticism of themselves. They're not just horrified if someone gives them a dose of their own medicine, they can't even handle constructive criticism in any capacity.

All of it is obnoxious."

I'm always there to talk to my friends, support them, etc, but I rarely get invited to lunches, dinners, parties etc. It hurts so much when I get on social media and see my friends hanging out with these pretty people and they're like ""with my bestie"" when I've been their friend longer and have been a better friend. Even when I do hang with them, it's like I'm invisible even to them. I never get a sentence out, because no one cares what I say and I'm always talked over. I need better friends lol

And increased education actually acts against women.
"So I was working at a themepark, you know, one with a castle in the center and a lot of mice stuff around, and my particular job involved telling a lot of jokes. So I used to do this thing where if I saw someone wearing a sports team's jersey, hat, whatever, I would say, ""High five from a fellow \[RIVAL TEAM\] fan!"" And they would always reflexively high five before understanding, and then they'd laugh and their families would razz them a bit. Super innocent, as would be expected at a place like that.   


So one time I see a guy in a University of Oregon hat. I do my stuff, ""Hey, high five from a fellow Beavers fan!"" He gives me the high five, stops, turns, and glares at me. His wife or girlfriend smiles and laughs, and the older adults (parents or inlaws?) tease him a bit.   


So fifteen minutes later the guy walks back up to me and says, ""Where did you go to college?""  


I start to say, ""I didn't, I Joined the military instead,"" but before I could finish, he said, ""I thought so. That's why I make more in a week than you do in a year.""

"I have no idea where I ""fall on the scale"" other than ""not a model"" and ""people don't run from me in horror""."
"The dichotomy between ""the single life"" and the relationship/settling down/""responsible adult life"".  Based on the people I know in their mid twenties, I feel like the single people need to get their shit together a bit more, and not wait for a partner to do it for them. And the people in relationships need to lighten up and do things with their friends more and have fun, instead of pressuring each other to be as grown up and boring as possible and try to meet some imaginary expectations and society pressures.

Also it sucks how normalised cheating seems to have become. If you want to sleep with multiple people, just find someone who is ok with an open relationship. That's much healthier and it really works well for some people."
"I can relate! I’m currently in high school and my prettier friends are always hit on, have kissed/made out with guys and then I’m kind of the undesirable one who has never had any of that happen to me.

"Muslim woman here. Not married, but have dated outside of my culture/faith a lot. My only “long-term” relationship was about 6 months though lol. However, no one from my family knew about that relationship, or any others, as they would 
just be super angry and disappointed . They’re very conservative in terms of dating and any pre-marital relations so I guess I’m leading a double life in that sense, but I really wish I didn’t have to :("
"as an ugly woman i can say a lot about this. i get stared at and whispered about on the street as well as treated much lesser in a negative way from a bad first impression due to my face. ugly women get treated less seriously. i was also bullied a lot at school and disliked by people even considered friendly before i even spoke to them.

ugly men definitely have it easier than ugly girls like me. not saying there aren't standards but it is much less harsh on ugly men. their personality at least matters while for an ugly girl they HAVE to look good"
"People tend to think there are only introverts and extroverts. Ambiverts are those in between and majority of people. Everyone (even introverts) want social interaction and everyone (even extroverts) need some time alone. Some more. Some less.

Sadly sometimes are people afraid of beong alone because they start thinking about stuff. It's easiest to run away from everything, call a friend and not give a fuck. What is hard is to make peace with yourself and be able to be alone. We (more introverted people) are ""lucky"" thst we learned to be alone. Bit many people can't handle it.

Why I say that is: my ex was like that. She said if nothing is happening she starts to think about stuff, starts to worry and that happens very fast.

Distraction is never a key. But many people don't see that. "
"I HATE the moment when you’re catching up with a well-meaning friend and they ask, “so what about guys in your life?” I feel like I need to come up with excuses (oh, I’m busy working, oh, that one guy I liked moved away) when the truth is I’m happy as a freaking clam with my dog and my Netflix!"
"Rehoming a pet. 
I got ferrets last year after months of research. I got them the perfect cage,  the best food, toys, had a room for them, ferret proofed the rest of the place, let them out for more than the suggested 4 hours-- I thought I knew what I was getting into.  

I struggled for 4 months to fall in love with them before taking them to a ferret rescue. It was an awful choice to make. It's been a year and I still worry about them. 

I know I made the right choice. They deserved a home that did more than tolerate them.

"This has happened to me quite a few times.

Story one. Man at train station has Captain America shield backpack. I make comment on backpack because it's cool. He looks me up and down and says ""I have a girlfriend"". I reply, ""I wasn't asking you out dude, I just like your backpack.""

Story two. There a many many many dogs that get walked around where I work. I LOVE IT. Most people are completely ok with me asking if I can pat their dog, but this guy just looks at me and scoffs, and tells me he's gay. I laughed and said, ""I know, I'm asking to pat your dog, not you."" And then he let me pat his dog.

I don't know whether it's because I'm so horrendously disgusting or something that they must think I'd be so damn desperate to ask them out, or their heads are so far up their own asses that they can't think that anyone would want to say something to them without it being a come on."

From Bowl of Oranges by Bright Eyes. In the normal course if life I've lost so many people that I love. It's horrible and raw and it hurts. In a lot of ways there is never any closure. You just kind of scar over and love some more anyway. Life can feel like being dropped into the middle of a movie, and then getting pulled out of it before it ends.

"All my life it was drilled into me homosexuality is a choice.  Then my oldest came out. He’s very much a people pleaser so I will never forget what he said to me with tear-filled eyes, “Mom, why would I choose something that makes people hate me?”

"I agree. People try to tell me that ""jealousy just means they care about you!"" and I'm really not convinced. When I've been jealous, it's not because I cared - it was because I was insecure. Or it was because the other person was doing things like cheating. I don't feel jealous in my marriage now because it's healthy and I'm a confident and secure person now. 

And frankly, I'm terrified of jealousy because of a past relationship where jealousy just led to abuse. "

They both told me, separately, to make my bucket list early, and start living it right now.  I decided to make a list, too. Since last year I have changed my life so I spend most weekends and the occasional week checking items off my bucket list.  I spend my evenings planning how to go about doing bucket list items. I’ve had more fun living life in the past year than I’ve had in the entire past decade or more.  It’s easier to manage being tired because I have something on the bucket list to look forward to. Doing what I’ve done makes me tired, too, but it’s a different kind of tired. It’s an exhilarated, fulfilled, smiling tired. I highly recommend making a bucket list now. Life is our playground. "

I was going over our results with him and he just wasn't getting it. But he wouldn't admit that he didn't understand. It's no problem to say that, we expect it...but after like the 50th time trying different ways he looked at me and said ""if you were a man and not a pregnant woman, would you be better at your job?""

"&gt;Hello?! Watch any shows with gay men in them recently? It’s ALL about telling 40 year old dudes how to become attractive! (ie. Queer Eye on Netflix)

To be fair, I don't think that actually goes against the point all that much. I think those shows are largely popular in part *because* it's relatively rare for someone to tell a 40 year old dude how to become more attractive."
"My mom a a complete and totally hysterectomy, due to her ovarian cancer. Her uterus, Fallopian tubes, ovaries and cervix were all removed. It couldn’t be done laparoscopically as her tumour was 15cm in diameter. Her recovery time was about 2 months to be able to kind of do the things she used to but also had to go through chemo so I think that affected her as well. Since she had cancer she wasn’t allowed to go on any sort of hormone replacement. Which I have noticed has cause mood swings. It’s been about 3 years or so since then and things are good!! Again her surgery was quite invasive and not done by choice. She was also only in her early 40’s when this happened and she was swung into early menopause. I’m sure if she had the ability to choose if she wanted it all gone she would have said no, but cancer is scary and she is alive!!"
Space and what's past our universe/galaxy. We have no idea what's REALLY out there. Then at the same time- this is it. This is all we have. 
"Only worse is when they come up in pairs for one to hit on your more attractive friend and the o e settling for you makes it clear he is. I feel like they pull out all the stops to act like a douche bag with out directly insulting you in an effort to make themselves unattractive, but it's like, id rather have no company than poor company lol "
"Hate it when guys ask stupid questions just to get your attention because they’re insecure AF. 

A guy at work who has a crush on me kept instant messaging me about random bullshit (e.g. his dreams, space, AI, dating advice) while I was busy with a project. He sits next to me in an open floor work setting. It’s clear that I’m busy on a detailed project on Excel and have headphones in because I don’t want to be interrupted. I’m only ignoring him because the conversations aren’t work related and disrupt my workflow.

He interrupts me twice and asks if he could use my scissors when we have a room full of supplies (he knows this too, and we don’t need scissors for our job - ever). Then he asked me for tissue 5 minutes later (he exactly where to pick them up yet he purposefully interrupted me).

I’m a very nice person but I can’t stand needy men who don’t know how to respect my boundaries. It’s exhausting."

"Wait, they were criticized for it? I'm a man, and I rather *liked* Newt. I didn't love the movie overall, but I found his character to be a good enough reason to enjoy the film."
"the more you give, the less they respect you. it's a weird kind of twisted reasoning: ''i know i'm a loser and couldn't possibly love myself, so the more you try to go on about me being so great the more full of shit i know you are, and the worse it will be when the shoe finally drops. might as well take what i can before you leave''.

you have got to put your foot down and make counselling/possible mental health services a condition to saving the marriage. hope things look up for you, friend."
"Dude as someone who just got over the top screamed at by my boss on Friday, I feel this so hard.

She has to go to 'special training' but I already moved my desk across the office.

I don't care that you were tired, agitated, don't like me, have too much on your plate, whatever. You still don't get to yell at me like that. 

I get upset as well but I still manage to contain myself.

I can only imagine if this situation was reversed that instead of the manager receiving 'training' it would have been me getting fired.

I'm so out. Sent out my resume after I left the office that afternoon."
A while ago a dude’s Instagram went viral because he kept talking about his *plus sized* girlfriend and how much he loves her. People were rolling their eyes because she’s actually attractive and thicc in all the right places. 
"&gt; You can't save a marriage if only one person wants to work at it.

Any relationship, really"
"Also this fun one:

""I'm not interested in seeing you anymore""

\* he sends 1000+ calls/texts after which I have to block him because no means fucking no and I have to work tomorrow and 50 of them start to get sociopathic and abusive even though I didn't think the guy was like that \*

Next day or days later, mutual friends tell me I'm an asshole for ghosting him.

I love how these idiots always claim their ex is a crazy maniac... First red flag out of many.

"I grew up homeschooled and always felt like an outsider.  I tried to fit in by blending in as much as possible, but if anything it made my desperation more obvious.  

At home, my family communicated through quirky, dry sarcasm.  Eventually, I started to let a little of that slip out.  When people laughed, I suddenly felt more accepted than I had ever felt before.  Just thinking about the times I've been called ""funny"" is more precious to me than any award or achievement.

In a way, it's limited my ability to communicate in larger social situations.  It's my fallback when I'm feeling insecure or fearful of judgment.  But I think the trade-off has been worth it.   "
Honesty works best when coupled with Tact.
"Lol the first time a boy started to pressure me into anal, I wasn’t really sure what to do about it. He was my boyfriend. I had told him it made me super uncomfortable to think about, but he brought it up all the time, anyway. 

After we had broken up (thank GOD I never gave in, he turned out to be the worst), I finally opened up about it to a couple of my girlfriends over wine (I had been way too embarrassed about it before). Turns out boys putting this pressure is super normal. One of my friends was like “oh yeah, I always tell him we can do it right after I stick my Comcast remote up his ass!” 

It was so funny. 
But fr can dudes stop with that shaming and pressure. Sorry, I don’t want it. "
I had a discussion with my mother about blind faith and politics. I don't understand why some people can't admit that their political parties make mistakes too. I don't blindly follow any political candidates. 
"He told me we needed to talk and that he has ""certain expectations"" from a girlfriend. The cooking and waiting on him were because he ""worked all day and shouldn't have to deal with it."" I was working 60 hours a week at that time. He said I could drink a glass of wine while I cook for him to make up for it. "
"A guy once smiled at me!

"“I don’t mean to be rude but I couldn’t help but notice your face. You should try accutane. It fixed my daughter’s skin”

"Everyone making assumptions about your personality. I haven’t experienced this, but I’ve heard people talking about a lesser attractive girl and saying things like; “she doesn’t seem smart” or “she wouldn’t be fun at parties”. So on... it just seems that attractiveness is correlated with positive traits in a person and vice versa. "
"I was a phone sex operator for a month. I did it because I was unemployed and needed the money. The income sucked though, I think I earned like $800 that month, working 7 days a week, 12 hours a day. I hated the job, and to be honest, it turned me into a misandrist and someone with a permanent chip on their shoulder, something I’m still working to get past."
"Yeah I think unattractive men are perceived as creepy or threatening in totally benign situations. The flipside is conventionally attractive men can more easily get away with abhorrent behavior, or gain access to situations that allow them to be predatory.

Unattractive women are more likely to be ignored  mistreated as ""invisible"" though the worst can be assumed of them in other ways - a store manager might be willing to give an attractive woman a discount or special treatment, while treating an unattractive woman like a thief or scammer."
"I went through something similar.  I lost about 60 lbs and suddenly I was visible.  Men smiled at me, made small talk, and paid attention.  I don’t mean just being hit on (although that has started too), I mean just acknowledging my existence.  I didn’t realize I had been invisible all those years until I became visible."
"I use OB and they don’t take up a lot of space, so I just always have the zip pocket in my purse full of them. At any given time, I could be Tampon Oprah.

"What annoys me is that every time a successful women is favourably talked about, a mention of how beautiful she is comes up. Even if she's not. Like why?

""This smart and beautiful woman""
""This strong and beautiful woman""

Successful men are not complimented on their ""handsomeness"" nearly as much. Even female empowerment messages feel the need to include shit like ""women, everywhere you are beautiful""

I feel it subtlety presses the notion that women must be beautiful, and the importance of physical appearance will forever be attached to them

ghosting instead of communicating properly . 
OMG yes. I'm fucking baffled when I learn couples didn't talk about whether they even want kids or whatever 3 years into the relationship! Holy shit! Get that stuff out there as fast as possible.
"It is *PHYSICALLY* more comfortable to get into a made bed vs an unmade bed, it’s not just about neatness. Making the bed means the sheets and duvet/blankets and everything are aligned properly when you get in and there’s no bunching or gaps between the layers.  
  
I am currently having this argument.

"I had a guy ask me out once by prefacing it with, ""I know other men don't find you attractive, but..."" 
I declined! To be fair, we were both young and he apologised to me about it a couple of years later."
