"Toilet flushed. Cleaned plunger. returned to cabinet. Currently watching Netflix. I was hoping for more fun but she seems more sleepy than anything else right now. I might have been invited over to be a pillow, and am considering the possibility I am going out with a cat. Still adorable.

Edit: purely hypothetically of course."
"No dating, no having friends over to the house, no extracurricular activities, no using the car for work, I had to buy my own clothes if I wanted anything more than pants or a Walmart shirt.

This is what I fear--indulging my happiness in solitude so much that I lose the capacity to find happiness in others.
Everything about weddings!
I wasn't allowed to watch Roseanne. I watched it at my friend's house once and then confessed to my mom about it because I felt guilty and also saw nothing wrong with the content of the show. Then I learned that the rule only existed because my mom thinks Roseanne's voice is annoying.
 I want to know how the rest of hypothetical date goes 
I know it’s very high school but I’m a sucker for dry humping lol. I wanna feel that boner

"Asking questions like pulling teeth.  I'd ask what he liked to do, or what his job was, or what sort of food he liked.  1 word / 1 sentence answers."
"Bullfighting. Those fuckers are torturing innocent animals to make a show for other twisted individuals.

(I'm spanish and I hate that's the first image some people get of my country)."
"My parents who lived under Saddam’s regime in Iraq all their lives (I lived there too but left when I was 9) were absolutely FREAKED about me wanting to become a journalist or a politician. To them, people who were in these professions would regularly be brutally murdered and have their corpses delivered to their parents’ doorstep as a warning. "
"this may be just where I live, but most people here are lukewarm Catholics who only baptize their kids out of tradition and so that they will be able to attend Catholic schools which are known to be stricter and more homogenous. "
"Met up with a guy from online dating,ım a pretty tall woman (6’8 to be exact) and i make it clear in my profile.

Talked to this guy for about a week online and he wanted to specify that he was fine with the height difference, then we meet up for the first time in real life and after 5 minutes he says “sorry i didnt think you would be this big” and then goes away."
I went to a school which would give you a days supply of sanitary products (like 5 pads iirc) if you asked at the office so I'd ask when not on my period to build up enough supplies.
"I’ve found that for me, telling someone I need alone time but giving them an “end” time is helpful. Like saying “hey tonight I need some alone time but let’s talk Saturday morning. Can I call you then?” Or “I feel like I want to stay in and read tonight, but id love to hang out with you later in the week. When are you free?” If I just say I need to be alone with no resolution then that has a tendency to make people feel like they did something wrong. But if I reaffirm that I still want to talk or hang out with that person by giving them a time and letting them know that I’ll reach out or asking to make a plan makes it more clear that it’s a me thing.

"I know this is going to be really unpopular, but bridal showers? So unnecessary for the vast majority of couples.

If you are both just moving out of your parents house, cohabitating for the first time, and short on money, I am more than happy to buy you a blender.  Otherwise, why am I being invited to an event where the obligation is to “upgrade” your pots and pans and buy you china you likely don’t have the space/means to use anyway?

Doesn’t go for first-time baby showers though. No one has baby stuff laying around, so I’m happy to buy your kid some things to get started.

My two cents as a 28-year old bride who thought a wedding shower seemed....extra."

"....Link from the legend of Zelda. Because he is hot, strong, and saves the world. I remember when I played Twilight Princess as a young girl, I would wear MAKEUP to idk...impress a videogame character? I was weird..."
"ask if she has one to begin with, if so it'd be in the bathroom (possibly in cabinet) or bathroom closet."
"To be downstairs in the house, you must have the same standard of dress as if you were leaving the house / in public.  I would be scolded if I was caught downstairs at 11 PM in my pajamas getting a glass of water."
"I don't think this is a universal human experience.

Introverts like myself will likely agree and relate, but I doubt extroverts would feel the same."
"I wasn't allowed to watch movies where magic was beneficial to the protagonists. This left out the majority of Disney movies, but my grandparents broke that rule for me."
"I mean makeshift toilet paper diapers and tampons were absolutely a thing, and it wasn't just the poor kids either. You do what you gotta do."

Asking a girl's father if you can marry her.  What the fuck?  
"My mother grew up poor. She also grew up in a family that was not very communicative.

Even though she had older sisters, no one prepared her for when she got her period for the first time. She thought that she was bleeding to death.

When she went to her mother in tears, her mother said that it was normal and happens once a month. 

She then went to a closet and brought out a rag for my mother to use in place of sanitary pads. It was a ripped up piece of old clothing.

Apparently my grandmother and aunts regularly used rags and had to wash them out and dry them. They couldn’t afford disposable products.

My mother used rags until she got married to my dad. Then she went out and bought sanitary pads. Even though she and my dad were poor when they first started out, she felt that disposable sanitary products were a necessity.

When I first got my period, my mom opened up her closet and it was like a pharmacy, with all different types of sanitary pads and tampons. She didn’t want me to experience her childhood.
 
Edit: *not* very communicative"
"Met on an app, he was really fun and interesting on text, asked loads of questions and had great chat. We met. The guy spoke about furniture for 2 hours. Furniture he's bought, the furniture he's sold, where he's sold it, how he likes his sofas made, how he doesn't like them made...it went on and on and on and on without a single break or question. I'm all for people having passions but my god he was boring. I'm normally good at leaving when I'm not having a good time. After an hour I got up to go to the loo, got back to the table, put on my coat and in the meantime he'd got himself another drink and kept talking to the extent that I just gave up and sat back down. With my coat on. For another thrilling hour listening to him talk about furniture.

&amp;#x200B;

The best part was about a month later I was chatting with a friend and she started telling me about this guy she just went on a date with who bored her half to death talking about furniture...."
"This is most of mine and I'm actually grateful for a Meh date over a bad one.

* Guy looked different than his photos so I was slightly put off by that. We spent almost an hour chatting at Starbucks about common interests. Realized we lived an hour away from each other and that was hard enough, but we both drove in opposite directions for work making it even harder. It was a nice date but I was ok when he didn't text me after. Went to Costco and got this amazing blanket I saw the night before and gave myself a day to think about, totally worth it.  
* Guy didn't show up. Claimed he didn't know. I told him to scroll up to our conversation a few days earlier. Went to Hobby Lobby and bought some craft supplies on clearance.
* Guy showed up, late, covered in pet hair. I have cats and use a lint roller often. He stared. It made me uncomfortable. He wanted to go to out again. He also lived pretty far so when he texted me I cited distance as my reason for not meeting again. Went to Michaels after. Think I got washi tape.  
* This guy also turned out to live kinda far. My first and only tinder date. We talked for awhile and that was fine. Didn't really click. He liked to talk about how much money he made, which was weird, he didn't seem interested so why was he trying to impress me? Maybe just liked to brag. He didn't contact me again and I was ok with that. I can't recall what I bribed myself with after this one but I suspect it was Michael's because it was the same location as the last date. "
"I have stopped running errands later in the evening after watching too many episodes of “Disappeared”.  No need to be kidnapped from a deserted parking lot over a gallon of milk. It can wait until Saturday.

I also have begun letting people know where I am or where I am going, and when I think I will be back.  It’s good for people to know if your gone way longer than expected, even if it’s just a broken down car!

I also acknowledge people when I am walking, to let them know I see them and am aware of their presence. "
Consider the possibility that you are being evaluated as safe-pillow before being evaluated as safe-lover.  
"My son recently started Kindergarten at a public school.  I was surprised to see that they have the kids cite the Pledge of Allegiance each morning.  I signed the form giving him the ""permission"" to sit and remain silent if he chose to do so.  I didn't tell him that he had to sit, but if he didn't feel like doing it, go ahead and sit.   Why are we making 6 year olds say the Pledge?  It's creepy and dark.  They should come to the conclusion to cite allegiances organically and on their own."
I actually used my standard line on a guy like this... “Judging by your one word answers and lack of follow up questions I’m going to assume you are not that interested and politely bow out of this conversation.” He panicked and asked if we could talk on the phone instead of text. We are getting married in February. He was that bad at texting but a talker on the phone. 
"I think it's only dangerous if it's extended solitude, even or especially if it's self-imposed. Practically everybody, regardless of how willing they are to admit it, needs a little socialization every now and again. "
"I went on a date with a guy who was very nice, but he was a nervous giggler and it drove me nuts.  We met up for a drink and then he proposed having dinner (which I really agreed to because I was intrigued by the menu, and I thought that maybe with a little more time he would get less nervous).  But the ""heheheheHEEhehehehe"" after every sentence got really, really old, and I just...I couldn't do it again."
"The sexiest thing I can imagine is being backed up against a wall, feeling their dick on my leg, them caressing my neck and my face, putting their hands in my hair, biting my lip, moaning, and just generally being passionate.

"If you wait until you need one to get it, you're going to have a bad time. "
"I like how you console yourself with crafts and shopping after your meh dates, if I used this strategy I'd be going on so many meh/bad dates just for the excuse to buy more craft supplies"
"It was pretty amazing. It was like we were both competing to be the best roommate. I'd bake stuff, he'd clean extra things, I'd do his chores and he'd snuggle me for ages. We kind of figured out things as we went along and never had any issues. 

When the newness wore off, we just kind of settled into a rhythm. But we still did and do all the nice things for each other."
"There was definitely a lot of ""puppy love."" The excitement of finally getting to spend more time together. Like a never ending sleepover haha

It hasn't changed too much, except now we have set chores that we do each day, and sometimes we bicker about going to the grocery store. (Let's get it out of the way versus can't we just do it tomorrow??)

I think we didn't have too much adjusting because we both come from households that expect a lot of housework and stuff, and we were open about money stuff from the beginning. "
Having to decipher if someone is actually telling you what to do or just giving unwanted advice.. 😅
"My best friends parent's rule. He was constantly grounded, unable to leave the house or have friends over. Except for me. Not only was I allowed over at any time regardless of whether he was grounded...or double grounded. But he could also spend the night at my house. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cue years of him rolling by my house, chilling for a bit or what not, then bouncing to his girlfriends or wherever and showing back up in the morning. I think his mom called like twice to check on him when he didn't answer the phone. I just said I ran to the store and I'd have him call when I got home. Giving him enough time to also reach my home. This lasted all of high school; and a decade later we are still best friends and still laugh like hell any time we remember this."
My dad demanded that we turn the tv to channel 10 before we turned it off. He could get legitimately angry if it wasn't on 10. Even if he was going to watch a different channel anyways.
"I snorted. 

If a man walked out of my bathroom and had the balls to say that 10/10 would bang 😂😂"
"ALISTAIIR THE RIGHTFUL KINGGG from dragon age. I mean his charm, wits and bravery... I... I need some alone time, please excuse me."
Random but my friends mom who fled Castro would get super freaked out at non married couples dancing. Even stuff like slow dancing or waltz which is tame it was hard for her not to oogle at cause it was seen as extremely illegal and sexually explicit to dance with a man who was not your husband. She said she thought it was beautiful but even after years in America she still found it crazy
I don't know if it has been mentioned here before. But not having your elbows on the table.
I’ve never let a date pick me up or take me home. I always brought my own car. Stay in public. Plan my own dates or suggest where to meet to ensure I’m comfortable with the surroundings and know what’s around me. 
In my culture the men always get to eat first at any large gathering.
"The same way I deal with anyone like that - with cheerful, helpful patience. It gives them nothing to work with, and they often end up putting themselves in stupid positions and needing help out of them.

Never at the risk of patients, of course, but I've only had to have one shout at someone in 7 years so I figure that's not too bad. The rest of the time my patience has worked."
"I agree with most of this.  I love solitude.  It is HARD WORK for me to be social.  I definitely don't hate it, but it does take effort.  I also don't understand why solitude is dangerous.  I am not a person who is lonely in solitude.  I am a person who is fulfilled by my hobbies and interests, even when most of those activities are for a single individual.  I think it might be dangerous for someone who feels lonely due to solitude, but that's not me.

The only person who doesn't drain energy is my SO.  He and I seem to operate on the same wave-length and I can be with him and interacting with him every day without issue.

"In my senior year of high school I went on a date with this guy who was quite interesting and good looking. However, he took me to a rather expensive restaurant and told me to order whatever I wanted (for the record, I didn’t get anything expensive and his meal was twice the cost of mine). At the end of the meal, he told me he didn’t have enough money to pay. I covered the rest of the bill (which was slightly over half the bill).

I don’t mind paying for half of the bill but, he invited me out and chose the restaurant and implied multiple times that he was paying so, it was in bad taste. Rubbed me the wrong way."
"Mom would arrive at school at 6:30 a.m. to beat the 10-minute traffic. School started at 7:40 a.m. My sister and I would have to wait in the car until 7:20 to get out. Get out earlier? Screaming, scolding and silent treatment."
"Growing up in a family of 8 with 7 girls clearly made it difficult to have enough pads or tampons. As the oldest, I remember being like 12/13 and wanting to make sure my sisters and mom had enough so I would make a sacrifice. I decided to try and make my own washable pad.... LMAO. I sewed two rags together and put toilet paper between them. I then sewed this “washable pad”to my panties and tried it out. It worked for a day until I realized I would have to wash it daily to keep using it. I did it for one whole period and decided it wasn’t worth the trouble and it started to stink bad. "
"One of the things that really makes me melt is when we're making out and he puts his hand on the side of my neck, like all splayed out. Thumb coming up my jaw, palm just under my ear, and pinky resting where my neck meets my shoulder. For some reason that just makes me feel small and cared for and safe. I love it so much."
"Having to choose Miss Mrs or Ms. Why do you want to know my marital status just because I'm a woman?

I was thinking about this while booking flights today."

"My husband wants to instill this in our future kids. I get not wanting a child running around naked but...  no. I want my child to feel comfortable in their own home. 

ETA- if you want to be fully dressed, cool. If you want to hang out in pajamas or comfy clothes, I’m not gonna stop anyone from doing that in my house. I want everyone to be comfortable. "
6 foot 8! That's amazing!
"Being bi does not mean being attracted to everyone. I don't go through life having sexual tension with all of my friends (or any of them, for that matter). Attraction is complicated and it takes a while to cultivate. The stereotypes are garbage. I'm simply not attracted to most people. "
"That I couldn’t have boys spend the night or hang out with the door closed in my room.

This was only ‘dumb’ because I’m bisexual, had come out as bi and actively had girlfriends that my mum knew about yet *girls* could stay over etc.

So I had an active sex life as a teenager and it was only when I spoke to my mum about it as an adult that she clicked how daft her rule was."
"When man is jealous and is fighting for you in many ways. Like in those stupid movies - he’s waiting outside your school, he appears in middle of the night outside your house, he writes to you and basically IS STALKING, but in movie it’s shown as romantic guy who just loves you so much. Lol no girl, he’s a psycho who doesn’t take “no” as he should. "
"He can make balloon animals. I came home one day and there was a balloon giraffe on the table. I asked him where he got it and he just said, ""Oh, I was bored, so I made it.""

Edit: Fixed a typo."
"Don’t discount yourself for wanting to be safe. People call women crazy if they take precautions to avoid harm. They call them dumb if they end up dead in a dumpster somewhere.

Don’t play into that. Just do what you need to feel safe, and be aware of your surroundings. That’s the best anyone can do. "
"Grabbing my sides, hips, butt, and legs. Be passionate, and act like you want to be kissing ME. "

* Person who refused to eat at a restaurant because the silverware was cheap and rolled up in a paper napkin, plus the menu was laminated

* Person who grilled me with 999 questions but refused to say more than a sentence when I asked questions about them

* Person who agreed to a museum I wanted to visit then picked me up and decided we were going somewhere else

* Person who got peeved I didn’t want to control the radio in the car

* Person who insisted at great length I would love lobster if only they cooked it for me (I hate lobster)

* Person who spent the entire date looking for photos to snap for Instagram"
"My best friend is an extrovert. I'm an introvert..

She craves human interaction, and being alone for too long makes her restless and unhappy, and it spirals quickly into negative emotions. 

I am most at peace on my own for days on end, free to pursue my own interests. 

I'm very happy being around her, since she's a great person, but living alongside anyone for weeks on end starts to grate on me. "

"Dresses are easy, you can look nice without having to coordinate an outfit. You can just throw one on and it makes people think you put in more effort than you did. "
"I think all school should do this. Teen girls have enough to worry about without period struggles too! Our school had a vending machine in the changing rooms, but you had to pay. It was also not hidden, so it was embarrassing to use it. "

"It was the 90s. I'd been given a large carton of teen magazines from the 80s, clipped the free sample coupons from the corners of the carefree/tampax/etc ads and posted them all. For months I was getting free samples in the mail,  daily. The samples lasted me a coupla years actually, the only downside was finding a use for all the ""tampon hiding"" containers and wallets they all sent with the products!! 

Now, as an adult in a better financial position, I make sure we have plenty of sanitary products for myself, friends and guests and my daughters also have their own stash for when the time comes. They've also been told clearly that those items are a priority, as much as food staples, and that there will always be money to buy them."
"He wanted to have super romantic intimate sex (with the perfect music and the staring into the eyes) every single time. I wasn’t allowed to just have fun or be playful, ever, so I couldn’t enjoy it at all because it was so forced. He was a very all or nothing person, and I told him I couldn’t live like that. It’s kind of like food, you want something nourishing regularly, something fun from time to time, something fancy now and then. You don’t want to constantly flip between starvation and a ten course gourmet meal. Anyway, he said he couldn’t stand how I never took it seriously when I said I couldn’t stand how stuffy it was with him and decided that was enough. "
"I wasn't allowed to watch That So Raven. This is because my dad was a racist and the ONE episode he had seen of it was the one where Chelsea got a job and Raven tries to get a job at the same place. The boss wouldn't hire Raven because she was black and obviously that wasn't okay and the show talked about it. My dad didn't like that a black woman thought she should have the same rights as her white friend and that the racist boss was a bad guy. So I couldn't watch it.

I also wasn't allowed to hang up the Corbin Bleu side of my High School Musical poster. I tried to and he made me flip it over and put up the Zac Efron side."

"My dad likes to say ""I got it!"" Like he's catching the escaping soul and (hopefully) he's going to give it back to the person."
"My dad had a lot of dumb rules, my mom didn’t enforce them but we knew dad had to think we followed them lol. 

Weirdest one was that when we were home from school during summer break, we weren’t allowed to sleep in. My mom usually left for work earlier than my dad, so my dad would come wake us up before he left. If my mom left after he did, she’d just let us sleep lol. "
"I definitely found myself getting a bit depressed over how often everyone else seemed to be Out Doing Things, Living Their Best Life, even though I knew logically that everyone just posts the highlights on social media. 

So now I don't use social media except reddit and a Twitter account I only use to follow youtubers and podcasters I like 🤷 honestly I don't miss it"
"we couldn't wear short sleeves or shorts until x date (like june or something.) it didn't matter what the actual weather was like, unless it matched up with my mom's calendar date, it wasn't happening."
"Like I said in AM: if his apartment is a wreck, he's a wreck. A couple days of dishes in the sink is no big deal. Countertops sticky with cooking oil, moldy dishes by his computer, the smell of old beer wafting from under the bed? Dude is a train wreck and dating him will be like having a toddler who can legally buy alcohol. "
"If seen something about why that tradition started. Apparently sailors were know for being crass, uncivilized, etc and so everything a sailor did was something to be avoided. Well, since sailors were accustomed to eating their meals on ships that rocked with the currents, sailors ate their meals with their elbows on the table for stability and to keep their plates in front of them. This behavior continued on dry land and since sailors tended to do this, was associated with bad manners. "
Lol if he can’t find the plunger is means she doesn’t have one.. it should be in the bathroom..
Bojack Horseman. Very clever dark humour with some surprising touching moments. 
"Emotional intelligence. “Oh he’s a man, he can’t be expected to be in touch with his feelings” versus “she’s not maternal or caring at all, there’s something wrong with her”



It’s insulting to both but it’s expected of men and frowned upon in women. "
"How to make requests during sex. That it’s okay to say, “this is uncomfortable; I need a different position” or “slower/faster please” or “touch me like this” or “let me lead for a while.”

That porn sex isn’t real-world sex.  It’s fine and fun to try out some porn-inspired scenarios, but keep it real and honest.  Be yourself.

Don’t fake your orgasms. Your partner should know whether you really came or not. And sometimes it’s not even important to have an orgasm.  You can enjoy a journey without reaching the traditional destination.

Masturbating with your partner is a great turn-on and helps them understand what aroused you or brings you to orgasm."
"When a man makes any involuntary pleasurable moaning noise.  Not forced, when it comes out naturally like when you've just tasted something insanely good.

".. wait, this is a thing? american kids have to swear allegiance to america in school? every morning?

"I've felt for a long time people romanticize childhood/nostalgia *far too much* and act like adulthood is nothing but bills, depression and alcoholism and childhood was nothing but rainbows, sunshine and puppies. 

I'm not saying there aren't benefits to childhood that adulthood decidedly lacks, because there totally are, but when you're an adult you can make your own decisions independently of anybody else (Until you're a parent I guess, but that's a personal choice), have more complex insights and opinions about the world, eat as much candy as you want, etc. 

While you can't avoid certain aspects of being an adult that are in fact pretty shitty, we shouldn't ignore all the neat things about it and live in the same bubble we did at age 10."
"I’m not afraid to seek helpers when needed.

EX: one time when I worked downtown in a large city, I walked to a bookstore on my lunch. A guy came up to me and tried to chit chat, I was polite but sent the clear signal of “ok, this is the end of our interaction” and kept browsing,

Until I noticed he was following me in the store. And kept coming up to me to ask about what I was looking at. I found a security officer and asked if he could find someone to walk me back to my building. They did. I’m not embarrassed to ask for help when I don’t feel safe.

Also, when I rode a public train to work - on a few rare occasions I got off mid way and waited for the next line to come through. A few times there would be some really odd and concerning behavior. If it was enough to make me think the person could potentially start something on the train, I didn’t want to be locked in a metal moving box with them. You just never know.

I’ll never forget one time a man was talking and laughing to himself and continually pointing at the horizon and started laughing about “all of the dead white people.”  We were on the last leg with no stops and the tension in the car was thick. The guy beside me literally started to shield me which his body thinking something was about to go down.

I’m definitely a “see the good in the world” and I don’t assume I’m in imminent danger all the time, but better safe than sorry if vibes are weird.

"I lived in Eastern Europe during comunism. I also question people’s motives, tend to believe the worst about them, cannot stop negative thinking, although I have a very good life now. It’s as if my brain doesn’t know how to be anything else other than worried and paranoid. 
It is difficult for me to throw things away, even when they break. 

But the worst thing is the self-censorship. I simply cannot tell anyone what I really think. I keep a diary (very well protected) in order to “download” my inner thoughts. I write this diary in a personal code. Sometimes I look back and I don’t remember what I meant :-)

I look at my children, who have lived all their lives in the West, and I cannot understand how they can be so carefree, so open and honest. They always expect the best to happen- or rather, they expect normality. I always expect the worst - and I suppose that for me, too, that is normality. 

I’m obsessed with privacy and Internet security. Okay, that’s not so bad:-)

I buy a lot of food. Can never eat it all. 

In my dealings with any bureaucrats I never say plainly what I want, I always prepare a cover story. 

I don’t know how to complain about poor services or products. When I do it, I expect my request for a remedy to be denied - and although it never is, I’m haven’t yet updated my expectations. 

What I have realized is that you can take a girl out of a dictatorship, but you can’t take the dictatorship out of the girl.  

Anyone who knows me thinks I’m doing excellently, I’m a success story. I feel I hobble along through life. The fences and the fear are still here, in my head.

He didn’t understand menstruation. The first time he went with me to buy pads he suggested I buy a small pack of liners because “these would last you all year”. I immediately knew he was clueless so I asked him to explain menstruation to me. He said “don’t you girls have that day of the month? This pack has 12 so it should last you all year”.  Of course after laughing I explained things to him leaving him in shock.
"I read a ton of books.  Didn’t put pressure on myself to find someone new right away, and treated my heartache as if it were the flu—a physical illness that would be soon to pass.  Then I let myself get better and took precautions not to have more pain than necessary— like cutting all contact with him and restarting my life with a new, stronger outlook. "

Keep in mind that overall in development we are not that much higher than Venezuela, and we have open market economy which makes all the difference. 

THey also point out some culture shock that are unique to Peru/Lima, like the insanely shitty traffic, work ethic and Good food we have, but that's not something universal. "

"I consider a man to be immature if he is unable to take criticism or any sort of feedback that isn’t positive. How one handles being told they’re wrong or doing something incorrectly says a lot about them. If they react with anger or denial, it shows they’re too immature to admit when they’re wrong or don’t know something. "
"I wasn't allowed to date the same person two times in a row, as my parents didn't think it was a good idea to have a serious relationship while in high school."
I have a twin brother that's super shy. He's never ever nervous giggled around me ...until he met my now husband. It was the sweetest thing ever at Thanksgiving when we first started dating and my brother was mega nervous and excited to meet him. Your posting made me realize though that he probably does it on dates and annoys the shit out of women haha. Poor guy.

"Grown men threatening to murder teenage boys that come near their daughter is in no way, shape or form adorable, precious, or sweet. It's not even being ""protective"". It's teaching your daughter she's too weak or stupid to make her own decisions so men need to do it for her, that men can't be trusted (but how dare she not trust her dad), that her innocent crushes are dangerous, and that she's an object for men to pursue or possess. (It also says sons are either unimportant to do this to or are allowed to do whatever they like but daughters can't.)

And any idiot who thinks he can ""joke"" about laying a hand on my son is gonna be put in his place by me. 

So glad my dad was sensible and nothing like that."

"Started going to lunch w a coworker. Things escalated and he asked me to dinner. (STFU, I know) 

He kept talking about himself and when I would interject with my opinion or a related anecdote, he would go completely silent then get back to talking about himself. Basically he didn't need me to be there for this conversation to take place. 

He also thought it would be good idea to tell me how he ""used"" to be ""swimming in pussy"" and that he and his friends frequently equate women to tacos. ""Sometimes you get tired of having carne guisada every night (an attractive woman) and just want a bean and cheese. (An unattractive woman who they'd fuck but never date.)  

He hugged me at the end of the date and that somehow made me feel even worse.  Like really sack of shit, you're basically saying I'm not even a bean and cheese...I'm a flauta? Fuck you. Imma combo loco, puto! 

Everything was absolutely perfect before that. It's like something went off in him to self sabotage the whole thing, and we couldn't recover. I see him at work and keep it strictly business. It was just a head scratcher of an evening. "

"He seemed nice, but he would not stop talking about fitness. He told me out his weight lifting routine, his caloric intake, his macronutrient goals, his daily food plan, his bulks and cuts, etc. At one point he took his phone out and started showing me videos of himself lifting. I tried to change the subject multiple times before I succeeded, and at that point, it had been over half an hour."

"Here! Started dating at 26. Definitely a late bloomer, but around 25, had a few confidence issues crop up because of how the other girls viewed me and made some mean comments. But I got over it cuz I knew it's okay to take my own time. And when I got into the dating game, I realized why I was failing before. I am more of a different gal who not a lot of people(at least the crowd around me) were attracted to. I had to find my people. Or in this case my person.

 So what I am trying to say is, take your own time growing as a person. Life is long. Learn about everything. And last but not least, someone's definition of a woman(makeup/romance) will not be the same as yours. Have confidence to back your own definition and decision. There are no late bloomers only people at different stages in life."
Perfect your stone-face. Walk confidently. Trust your gut. Don't t stop and talk to someone who is setting off alarm bells just because you don't want to seem *mean*.

"Assertiveness.

He had trouble getting/staying hard 6 months into our relationship. We dragged it out for over a year because we felt we were compatible in almost every other way. It eventually impacted the rest of our relationship so we had to end it. He brought up the break up first but I knew it was coming for a few months before it happened. Sex is just too important to ignore.

"Don't do the Wolverine thing with your keys.

If you really feel like you need a weapon and you don't have anything to work with, wrap  your hand around them, and stick the pointy bit out of the end of your fist, so you can use it like a knife to stab with. It's easier to control, and you're much, much less likely to injure yourself.  "
"I started doing Yoga a few months ago and life is easier. I feel stronger, have better posture, carry myself better.

"Having to give bridal shower gifts when the couple already has been living together for years, have a nice house/home, have good careers/income.

It started out as a way to help get a couple started. For example, my parents never owned a house or lived together until they married. They didn't a lot of the household items - cooking ware, linens, etc.

Now it's just about being obligated to spend a bunch of money on a couple who already has their home fully set up. Then you're expecting to dole out some cash for their Stag &amp; Doe/mixed party, and then for the wedding gift. And if you ""cheap out"", then you're a bad friend/family member.

It's not just bridal showers... Basically any event where I'm required to give a gift out of obligation/custom rather than because I genuinely want to give someone a thoughtful present. 

Edit: To clarify, when I say ""gifts"" that also includes cash. When you give cash as a gift, it's still a gift. "

"I always felt pressured to be in a relationship since all my girlfriends were in long term relationships. After chasing and being involved with several guys (maybe with a month or two inbetween each one) I got really tired and discovered I wasn't really happy with who I was as a person so decided to work on myself and my own goals. 

To be honest it took a few awkward and 'wrong' casual dates to get to that point"
"3 years ago a guy asked me out and we started dating. We had decided to walk to his house but neither of us realized how long it would take and it was winter but once we got there were chilled in the garage and turned on the heater. We danced and played truth or dare with old country (aka the better country) on in the background. 

He was sweet and I really wanted to like him but the kiss just was like kissing a brother or something? (I don’t have brothers but I think that’s what it would be like) No spark or anything and afterwards I just went home and we decided mutually to break up, we are still friends to this day and I’m going out with his lifting buddy."

"I have multiple reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

**Physically:**

* I don't like the feel of makeup on my face. Feels like I'm caked with dirt.

**Psychologically:**

* I don't have the patience to put it on.
* I'm concerned that if I do start wearing it, I'd become accustomed to that unreal face and begin thinking of my real face as ugly, creating a dependency on makeup to boost my self-esteem about my looks.

**Financially:**

* Makeup (the good kind, not the cheap stuff that's bad for the skin and / or looks horrid) is expensive.
* Even cheap makeup is costly as all makeup needs to be replaced, and it's a vanity item -- not a necessity. I'd rather re-direct those funds toward something useful like food, bills, or long-lasting luxuries."
What do you mean you don't have a poop knife!?!
"Yes, we realized 3 months in, broke up, got back together and stayed together for another 3 years,  we were 18 so a dead-end relationship was fine. 

We had impeccable communication, fights were rare, and extremely short because we were both vocal about everything since we were truly each other’s best friend. 

But I wanted to adopt children and he wanted his own. I wanted to pursue higher education, then make 6 figures and own a big house in the suburbs, and he eventually dropped out of college and works at Autozone with no further goals. I wanted to travel, he’d rather spend money on concerts. So we stayed together until we fell out of love."
"The first time we moved in together was in his parents house in January of this year. We lived on one end of the house, they lived on the other. I didn't get along with his parents well. There was a lot of stress and fighting with his parents; basically, I didn't clean enough, cook enough, work enough, etc. (this is an incredibly long story that I'm not typing out unless you just absolutely need to hear it) I put up with this bullshit for 8 months. I finally gave him an ultimatum, either we go together, or I go by myself.

&amp;#x200B;

After much searching for something we could afford, we have now been living together in our very own apartment for a month. our relationship has vastly improved. our sex life has improved.. and he repeatedly tells me, ""I can't believe I waited so long to do this with you. I can't believe what I've been missing out on."" 

&amp;#x200B;

I love him very much, but I was not going to fight his parents for his love.

&amp;#x200B;

And as weird as it sounds... now me and his parents get along. What the fuck. (-\_-)"
"Lots. Mostly it was forbidden to wear sandals or sweatpants. They felt those were for lazy people and didn't want people to assume we were lazy. I didn't buy my first pair of sandals until the age of 24 and to this day, I still cringe when I go out in them because I just feel unkept."
Exactly. This is a really important distinction. It has nothing to do with the practicalities of sharing a last name and everything to do with women being expected to change their names to their husband's name. It's rare for men to change their names. People who get up in arms about a bride refusing to change her name are almost never suggesting that the groom change his. There's absolutely no question as to whether or not this is rooted in sexism.

Didn’t say a word, just turned around and got back in his Jeep.

"I was 18 and traveling to a town about an hour away alone on Halloween and stopped at local Walmart to grab a couple things. A group of guys (5 to be exact) walked out right behind me holding cases of beer. They were obviously following me to my car. There was only one guy that spoke to me but they all stood behind him. 

“Your pretty!”

“Where you going”

“Your ass is seriously amazing”

As I was unlocking it he came up and grabbed my ass and I whirled open my door turned around and fucking decked him. Full fledged Molly whop straight to the nose. Instantly explodes with blood. I immediately jumped straight in my car and locked the door and hauled ass. I heard him scream, “fucking crazy bitch broke my fucking nose!” as I was putting my car into drive. One friend looked concerned but the rest were laughing.

My body was full of adrenaline. I pulled over at a gas station and threw up and was trembling. My hand was bruised for weeks. But I was proud as fuck of myself.

 We were together for 5 years and he was about to propose. I had spent the previous few years discussing with him how I needed sex more than once a month. He always says he would try but nothing changed, in fact it got worse. Finally one day I broke, I spent a few weeks talking to him, telling him I couldn't get begging him to touch me anymore and that I'm unhappy. 

It was so hard to do, but looking back on it now, it was the 100% right decision, I just rush I had made it sooner. Sexual compatibility is so important in a relationship and I will not compromise to that extreme ever again."
"It was a blind date that my roommates set up with his roommates at the community hot tub. They insisted that he was gorgeous (narrator: he was not). 

We went to a fast food noodle company that was connected to a mall. He constantly talked about himself and most of it was pretty boring. Then half way through his roommates show up (we were facing a window out into the mall area and they could see us) and are laughing and mocking him through the window. I felt pretty bad for him. His roommates made it very clear he was a virgin and hadn’t kissed a girl and eventually turned to me asking if I was going to have sex with him. 

Him and I ended up leaving the food place and I kinda just wanted to go home. But he took me to Walmart to watch him go back to school shopping (college). By the time I got home I was bored and embarrassed. "

I recently told my sister that you will attract everything you don’t deserve because you feel like that’s all you can get. If you are in your 20s that’s the time to focus on yourself.

"My mom grew up during the military dictatorship in Brazil. The only thing she told be about that period is that you really had to watch out for what you or your loved ones said. As an example, she was still a child and her and her siblings decided to sing the national anthem but with some words changed to silly childish words. Not long after the police showed up at her house and demanded that my grandparents hit their kids in order to ""teach them a lesson"", my grandparents were scared so they did it even though they thought nothing of it since they were Portuguese, not Brazilians."
"I was in a relationship for 4 years with a guy who has extreme ED. While it didn't work out in the end, I know why, and have some advice. 

He unfortunately was very upset about it. Instead of accepting that it's a thing that happens (after we've gone to the doc to role out a health issue, tried testosterone therapy and Viagra etc), he put a lot of pressure on himself and honestly made it worse. Another issue is he wasn't open to other things that would please me. Like a strap on, toy, dildo, going down on me... Just really unable to talk about sex and be relaxed about it. 

So...a lot of this is his issue to deal with, you can help by being supportive and showing him other ways he can please you (and doing the same in return, try some new things with him, get him to talk about what turns him on etc, if you're uncomfortable watching porn together maybe read some erotica to him). Communication is huge, him feeling like you're both in this together and you have his back, him knowing you love him whether he can have 'traditional' PIV sex or not, him not feeling pressured... All will help. Look into sex counseling... It's not just the physical act but the emotional aspects of it.

Big thing to take away is you two CAN make it work. You both have to want to. And it may not be as you'd wish it to be in the end, but it can still be good, just in a different way.

Likewise for my mom, even though my friend can be quite a handful, he's good people, and has always been welcome in the house. Like our parents have never met in person, even after all these years. I think they might have spoken on the phone once. It was just a given from day one. I'm of the opinion that his parent's knew I was the type of person to help keep him out of trouble; and for my mom, she knew he was someone that would help me come out of my shell.

I can afford my mortgage and extra stuff BECAUSE I haven't 'moved up'. People at work are always whining about how broke they are, but I'm sure their mortgages are 1.5x what mine is.

Sure we could afford a bigger house, but why? So that our bank account can't grow? So that I can say my house has 4-5 bedrooms and is 3500+ sq. feet? Doesn't seem important to me."

"it pains me to admit this, but it’s a lot of ego stroking. if the docs I want something from fall into the category you’re talking about here, pretty much the only way to get what I want is to make them think they’re coming up with the idea. as a nurse this was a survival skill I picked up early on, so I can’t imagine how frustrating this is for women MDs who have the same educational background but *still* get patronized because medical school doesn’t gift you with a penis along with those credentials. typically what I do goes something like this: 

“excuse me, Doctor? so sorry to bother you. was just wondering about [this lifesaving thing I absolutely know you haven’t done]? did we do this already? I must have missed it in the chart, silly me. could you help me find it? oh... you didn’t do it? okay! no problem, just wanted to make sure I wasn’t missing anything!” tips: always refer to them as Doctor, they love being reminded how important they are. also give deference to how important their time is, and what a burden I am. lilt the ends of sentences up so it sounds like I’m asking a question. also, phrase my ask as a question so they get to take credit. ask for direct help so they feel useful. 

again... it pains me to admit it... but there are literally physicians who will go out of their way NOT to do something simply because it was suggested by someone they see as somehow inferior - and usually that inferiority is related to genitals (which is clear because you can see the difference between how these kinds of doctors treat male and female nurses - a lot of it is just boys club shit). it’s gross and infuriating and of course I feel manipulative - but quite frankly I don’t give a shit what a doctor thinks of me, as long as I’m advocating for my patient. 

also... a lot of this was dependent on the area of practice I was in. working the floors seemed to give docs license to talk to us like dog shit. I never felt so respected by physicians as I did in the ER. in the ICU, it was hit or miss (but working nights I got to deal more with midlevels, who were awesome, so it worked nicely for me not having to sell my soul and pretend I was a big dumb idiot who needed the fancy doctor to save me). I should add that I have worked with some really amazing physicians, male and female, who I have the utmost respect for. literally all it takes is for someone to treat me like a human being and not a piece of garbage. fortunately I think more often than not I’ve had some really great experiences - but you can tell the insecure and not so competent docs from a mile away, and if you do it right, you can keep your patients alive regardless.

I wanted to shovel, I like to shovel and do my own work. He argued with me. I gave in and just let him do it.

The next time he offered, I told him no. Then he argued with me. Then he asked me about 6 more times if he could shovel my drive &amp; walk. I told him no each time. Then he asked if he could come by my house after work and shovel my drive &amp; walk while I'm still at work.

My shift ends in twenty minutes. Why don't you sit tight here and I'll take you out and make you forget all about this loser.""

To clarify, the police officer in question took my initial statement at the emergency room and then drove me to the police station after I had been discharged from the ER. So he was was me before the nurses started cleaning me up, and when he hit on me I was unable to open my right eye due to swelling."

"We’d been dating a couple weeks, and had our first discussion about sex. He said he was waiting for marriage to have sex. I was like “Oh. Well that doesn’t work for me.” He looked like I had slapped him and I more or less continued that there was no way I could marry someone without having sex first, and an adult relationship without sex wasn’t in the cards for me. I told him good luck, and tried to get up and leave. When he realized I was serious he tried to backpedal but I told him I didn’t think we were a good match due to his beliefs. And also I wasn’t interested in being anyone’s first in my 30’s. And I left.

The minute I knew he was waiting for marriage anything after that was a waste of both our time. I wasn’t mean about it. It just wouldn’t have worked so no point prolonging it."

Do you not see any correlation between how you raised me (what I was not allowed to do) and why I am how I am, now? For the longest time she denied it and would say that ""you have to let go of the past"", but recently, she's started to admit that she obviously messed up in some places. I think it's more that, after leaving church, I started to do more things I wanted to do and she sees how much better (and happier) I am, now.

&amp;#x200B;

However, she was never stingy about buying clothing and such. Appearance was always VERY important to her, so she took pains to make sure we (my sister and I) looked nice and got stuff we wanted most of the time.

"My dad didn't have rules so much as thoughts he had in the moment and decided to enforce now though they were never an issue in the past, and he may or may not care about it in the future.  But here are the most notable:

* He didn't like me spending the night at anyone's house whose parents he didn't know, but he refused to meet anyone's parents
* He didn't like the description of Joey's dad from Dawson's Creek so I wasn't allowed to watch the show.  However, he had no idea what the title of the show was so I just wasn't able to continue watching that episode and had to wait a week to continue watching the show
* Once, two teenage girls died in a car crash in a suburb on the other side of the city (people we never met and had no association with) and I wasn't allowed to drive for two weeks
* He felt that if we got A's in our classes it meant that the classes were too easy and the teacher should make them harder for us.  My brother and I were lectured for getting straight A's.  My dad said he wished to see more B's because then he'd know we were being challenged."
I used to have guys meet me at a place I had been going for years and I knew the people there. Sometimes I would share my location with a couple of friends so they could see where I was if they stopped hearing from me. I also make a point to park as close to the door or light as possible at nighttime. 
"&gt;the funny part is that we were colleagues...for YEARS and she knew where to find me if I did anything rapey.

She didn't send them just because of potential rape, she sent them in case you killed her/locked her up afterwards so that her mom would have more than a name and place of employment to go off of when contacting the police as those could lead to delays while they can get your info from your car/license plate combo much faster. Wouldn't be shocked if she had a plan in place for her mom to call the cops with your info if she didn't hear from her at certain times."

But it’s good that I have that time to shake off work and prepare for an evening with my extroverts.  During the evening commute, I think of conversation starters for dinner. I don’t feel so drained when I have a plan. On the weekends, I will do a chore each day the requires me to be alone- laundry or grocery shopping (no on ever wants to go with me!).  And my kids are aware of my introverted-ness. If I say I need a few minutes, they give it to me. I ask for alone time so infrequently that they know I mean it when I do. That didn’t really start happening until recently though. Now that they are older, it’s easier to explain why I need some alone time. "

"Ladies, the people who run Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc are making millions off of your misery or FOMO. 

None of the founders, who are far richer than we will ever be care about how their platforms make you feel. 

What they do care about is how much time you spend on their platforms. Why? It makes them richer. They are not trying to save the world.

The likes you give to “influencers” who also have money behind their efforts DO NOT care about you. 

Spend time enhancing your skills, your relationships, your bank accounts through real work. 

That influencer who is about body acceptance is peddling (or will be) a fashion line so you can buy her stuff, the woman who lost a 1000 pounds through Keto is going to try to sell you stuff, etc.

"""You're not allowed to cut your hair short.""

I've always had a lot of hair and already at 3-4 years old, I had this really long mane down to my butt that was very gold blonde as well. I remember being stopped by strangers on numerous occassions to complement my hair, I was the ""girl with the long hair"" in my class for years.

I absolutely hated it. My mom is rough handed and couldn't comb through it without hurting me. I'm super prone to headaches so having all that hair tied up gave me tension headaches all the freaking time. I begged and pleaded to have it cut from like 6 years old to 14 when my mom finally let me cut it.

"Resident here in an overwhelmingly female specialty. We were having a problem with the mostly male residents in another specialty dismissing our consults, the acuity of emergencies in our specialty, and the pain of our entirely female patient population, (such as: “it’s just ovulation pain, she’s drug seeking” when it was in fact appendicitis, “how much can they really lose that fast” re: postpartum hemorrhage, straight up hanging up on an amazing new young female attending calling to place a consult.) It had been like that since I started, and the residents thought everyone just knew how bad it was and that no one thought they could change it. After a few bad outcomes driven by slow and dismissive responses to emergent consults, I lost my temper and complained to one of the higher ups in my department. Turns out none of the attendings had any idea how pervasive it was, and they were horrified at the interactions we’d been having, contacted the chair and residency director of the other department, and got it sternly addressed. Not only that, but our chair followed up with us every few months to see how things were going on the ground and readdress any especially bad offenders. It has significantly improved.

TL;DR: if you have to, go above them. This stuff can and does affect patient care, and it’s always worth bringing it up to those senior to you in your department. Sometimes what seems obvious to you really isn’t to them, It can be changed, and your patients will be better off for it. "
"Not really! Of course, there have been times where we're moody or stressed about something and act rude to each other, but we both do our best to apologize as soon as possible. As soon as it starts to escalate we look for the root cause of it and try to deal with that. It can be difficult in the moment, but it definitely has kept us from going beyond simple bickering. 

Our schedules have gone through periods where they rarely intersect. Those times suck more than when we get a lot of time together imo. There's more pressure to make our time together ""perfect."" "

"While we were dating, he helped me figure out that I was asexual. At first, he was very supportive, helped me find websites about asexuality (which I'd never even heard of before), and really helped me accept that about myself.

Despite him helping me through all of this, he started to pressure me into having sex I didn't want to have, and insisted that it was my duty as his girlfriend to satisfy him sexually. He would make passes at be constantly that he knew I wouldn't/couldn't reciprocate. It got to the point where I didn't want to change in front of him because he couldn't be around my naked body without trying to make it about sex.

Eventually he said that if I wouldn't have sex with him, we would have to break up. It seemed ludicrous to me, because sex is such an unimportant part of my existence, that it was like he was saying he would break up with me if I wouldn't go scuba diving with him, or something equally inconsequential.

It took me a while to really come to terms with the fact that sex is a big deal to most people. But we ended up splitting up - not *just* because of our sexual incompatibility, there were a lot of other issues as well, but it was definitely a catalyst to the downward spiral that ended in our breakup."

If you have some upfront money and reliable refrigeration... always buy family packs of meat. It freezes well and is sometimes less than half the cost per pound.

"Some people do remember the times of well-stocked supermarkets. However, a person born after Chávez got into power can't fathom how things were back then. 

As an example, my parents had me and my sister when they were still university students. They were able to build a house and furnish it, put us through private education, pay for holidays and weekend getaways, all just with my dad's income. We weren't rich but were solidly middle class. I remember having a pantry full of cookies, getting new books and Legos every other month, having new clothes every Christmas.

They had my brother in 2007 and his childhood has been wildly different. He barely sees my parents because now both of them have to work full time jobs, we can rarely afford treats for him, we haven't been able to buy toys for him in maybe five years and have to really strain to buy him clothes (every growing spur is a pain). 

I can imagine young Venezuelans who were born after Chávez came into power fleeing to Perú, Brazil, Ecuador, etc, and being a little bit shell shocked at the perceived prosperity, although the way locals perceive their country is widely different.

There was so much passion and care for one another, more love than I’d felt ever before.

He did not want the responsibility of committing to someone like me, and I did not want to drag his life down a path he would regret. 

I miss him often and think about him just as much, and wonder what he’s up to now. He made me feel so alive. A year and a half later and I still wonder what could have been. But I know it shouldn’t have been. "

"He already had laundry detergent that I knew I was probably allergic to, but it felt too new and awkward to ask him to throw it away and re-wash all the linens in the house with my laundry detergent. A week into living together I woke up feeling itchy. He rolled over and gasped at the sight of my back covered in hives. I confessed my allergy issues and he was rather confused and upset as to why I didn’t just tell him in the first place. We laugh about it now, but living together is so awkward at first. You don’t want to seem “high maintenance” but you also have your own set of quirks and issues that hopefully slowly leak out over time. Also, fuck cheap laundry detergent from the dollar store. "
Aggressively rub the clit with no lubrication. 
"Paying half when you order a third of whole price is not cool, even if he didn't imply anything."
"My sister and I weren't allowed to use long forks, glass cups, or the regular size towels without holes in them."
"Yeah so kind of haphazardly  getting your kid ready (backwards shirt, unbrushed messy hair) might seem cute/funny/endearing but if it was from a mom people would wonder what is wrong with her. Also when dads looking after their kids alone is called “babysitting”.... wut??!! 

"
"If they remove The Office, I will burn Utica to the ground."
"It wasn't a rule but I hated that my mom had her special food 

She had strawberry jelly just for her. We got grape.

Or she'd get honey Brad and we'd get plain white bread 

We'd go out to eat and she'd get her a full meal but we'd get $1 cheeseburgers.

Many examples of this crap.

I get that having a family is hard on the wallet but it irked me that she would treat herself better than the kids.

Imo if we need to eat off the $1 menu. We all should do it.

"
His hands in my hair. No idea why that turns me on so much. 
I'm 23 and I only just started college. I'll be 27 by the time I can get a decent job and move into a proper house/appartment. 
I'm not attracted to every woman or even most women.
My partner being male doesn’t make me a safe outlet for your bigoted thoughts. You can never assume that about someone...!
"I guess I was born and grew up in a dictatorship (1974 in the Philippines under Marcos) but I don't have any weird habits that I'm aware of.

I just wanted to comment and say I find this question really fascinating, so thank you for posting it. :)"
"He tried way too hard to impress me, I was enjoying the date but kind of cringed when he made himself sound like a special snowflake, we ate at this restaurant and said ""oh they'll take good care of us, I'm a regular and they love me here"" and more things like that

Also pretty sure he was negging me throughout the date, not to the extremes but enough to make me not want a second date "
"Yes, they generally know.  None of them are egotistical about it. They mostly seem embarrassed because it's extremely obvious that we get treated differently.  
They get approached a lot. My best friend gets stopped a lot and told how beautiful she is.  Men talk to her everywhere we go. 

I joke about it because she's both gay and taken. I'll tell her she should tell them they're wasting their time with her but she'd like to introduce them to her homely but promiscuous friend.  (Me) 

"
"I think even for boys that are Jewish. Just stop it, everyone, it’s an unfortunate and antiquated tradition.  "
Wasn’t allowed to watch The Cosby Show because my grandmother thought Cosby was a phony. I assumed she was just a lil racist but maybe she had good creep radar. 
People talk about each other behind their backs. 
"I know of my Aunty that was married twice with men and had 4 kids . 
She got cheated on by the man , and left him . 

She was content with being single because she found herself no longer having the desire for men. She just thought that was her only option. 
Until she met a lady which they were first friends, and they would always be together . She wouldve never thought she would find herself falling in love with her friend, they found connection. She says it’s more than what she’s ever felt with a man, they were communicating a lot more effectively, and there was nothing physical drawing them together either . Or at least she thought .

Ive never seen her happier. It was hard for her to come out because she is from an Asian immigrant background, at age 54. Life is short, she says . She is really happy with her partner, and she cannot imagine being without her . Been with each other for over 15 years . :) "
"Women and wine. For some reason this has taken over and while it is fine to enjoy wine on occasion, many of the wine memes make it sound like some of these women are alcoholics, which is incredibly sad."
"""Love is not the thing that leaves you out of breath. Love is what makes you breathe deeply and peacefully."""
"My boyfriend is an extrovert to the max and would used to think I was angry at him when I would not be responsive to his texts or would be a bit distant if we were hanging out in person. I really do feel bad for him because my introversion is really inconsistent and context-dependent. If I'm in a good mood, I'm very lovey-dovey and affectionate. If I'm not (for whatever reason), or stressed out, or if my anxiety has been ramped up a notch, I shut down. I need to be alone because all contact, both verbal and physical, irritates me.

So I told him this very early on in the relationship. That my desperate need for alone time came in bursts but that it was an anxiety thing and transient. He was understanding, almost apologetic about it... before I'd been straightforward with him, he'd always make fun of me (playfully) for being such a homebody and so reserved. It all clicked for him when I communicated all this. He still gets disappointed when I fall into one of these moods, wishing there's more he could do to help but he's learned by now that the most helpful thing he can do is leave me alone for a few days, and then I'll be ""myself"" again when I'm recharged and ready.

A lot of people don't understand this about me, so it's hard for me to form close relationships. People just assume I'm not willing to open up, or that I'm mean/rude/uninterested. I'm almost always interested in someone I talk to, I just take more time and patience to get to that level of disclosure and trust. It's not as intense with platonic friends fortunately, although if I spend too many days in a row with even my closest girl friends, I need some time apart to reset in order to enjoy their company again."
"Other than meat and guacamole, you can order double portions of everything at Chipotle without paying more. Next time you go, ask for a burrito bowl with two tortillas on the side, then get double portions of everything except meat and it will be like getting two burritos for the price of one (granted, with a little less meat than a normal burrito)."
"In my early 30's after kids and a really bad 8+ year relationship, I told myself I wasn't going to date anyone for at least a year.  That turned into 4 years.  I just enjoyed being alone and being with myself.  I made a conscience effort to make my life and myself better.  I told myself that I never wanted to have to depend on another human (a man) for financial stability, emotional stability etc.  

In doing that, I came to the conclusion that I was content enough with myself and my life, that if I were to remain single for the rest of it, I would still be living a happy and fulfilled life and I was ok with that.  Don't get me wrong, I went through times where I did feel lonely and wished I had someone to share life experiences with or a shoulder to lean on.  

Then when I decided to try dating I came at it from a completely different perspective.  I didn't NEED to find someone.  If I met someone who complimented my life and that shared the same values and goals and could enhance my life as a partner in this journey, then awesome.  Otherwise, I didn't need to be with anyone.  I already knew I could be miserable and lonely all on my own, I didn't need drama or someone else to make me feel that way.  I was really hoping to find someone who ENHANCED my life (and me theirs).  Someone who I could share my life with- not someone who I needed to fix or change or hope they would fit.  I was extremely picky and for the first time in my life, ended up in a healthy relationship.  I wish I had gone into dating and my teens knowing all of this.  haha  "

"assuming a wife is going to take her husband’s last name. I’m not judging anyone who did, but personally I’ve never really gotten it. changing your name is such a legal hassle and if you’re known professionally under your maiden name it’s even worse. I’m not sure it really helps the family feel more ‘unified’ either. moms and wives are better team players when they get to keep their own identities.
 I don’t really mind the idea of my kids having his name, though. ideally if his name is short we could hyphenate, but otherwise they can have a second middle name or something."
"Switching to a minimalist wardrobe. No more thinking about what to wear and what matches. I like everything I own and look good in everything. 

I have a fixed color scheme and strictly limit the number of items to ""one piece of each"" (I have 1 pair of blue jeans, 1 skirt, 1 work dress, 1 nice dress, 1 nice jacket, 1 pair of loafers, 1 purse etc.). I maybe have 50 items in total including shoes and accessories. 

I'm not buying anything just because I like it. If I don't have a specific and immediate use (I will wear this to work from now on), I don't buy it. Usually I only buy something new, if it replaces something old. "
Shit. This is happening with my husband. We waited until marriage and now I’m so scared this is going to end our marriage. 
"Why I was a kid, I would say ""God bless me"" after I sneezed. It took me way too long to realize that that was a bit odd and switched to ""excuse me."""
"When we went on family roadtrips, my mom always had a rule that we could only have one box of poptarts. This resulted in a terrible rivalry spoiling the beginning of every trip because I exclusively ate brown sugar cinnamon and my sister always wanted blueberry. The worst part is that when you ask my mom about that rule now, she has no justification for it and wonders why she didn’t just let us get the kinds we liked. "
"I'm going to be jealous of this for years, I know it. Like 3 years from now I'm going to randomly remember this and be jealous."

"So my brothers and I watched The Land Before Time movies constantly when we were kids, and it only just occurred to me a month or so ago (I'm 32) that Cera has that name because she's a triCERAtops. I never knew it was spelled that way and I figured her name was Sarah. Duh, me!"
"Women generally aren't raised to believe that we can expect a partner who will do all the domestic and emotional labor for us, requiring relatively little in return.

It's not so much that women are held by their female partners to higher standards as it is that women are expected by society to perform at higher standards."
"Uuuuuuuuuuuugggghhh this. My parents never subscribed to the role of my mom fixing my dad his plate, but my whole family does. On top of that, kids (aka anyone under 30) eat last—as grabbing their plates after the adults have gotten their plates. 

Edited to clarify what I meant by “eat last” :-)"
This was a rule in our sorority house because the bottom floor was public for non-members and boys... but who was going to show up unannounced at your own home??? 
"I think it’s almost even worse when they just talk on and on, but only about themselves. It’s like you’re interviewing a guest on a podcast. Unpaid. And the guest is boring and irrelevant."
"I’m still in school but I have had male students offer me advice or condescending help when I am going to see a patient when I did not remotely ask for it. I also had a male student challenge everything I said while we were in the same group, for months, in front of other students and doctors. He made himself look stupid, I didn’t take the bait. But hot damn was I mad that entire semester. 
Other people catch on pretty quickly when things like this are going on, and being better than they are is my best coping strategy for now.

"It's another one of those pagan holidays (Candlemas) that's been so far removed from its original context that it doesn't really make sense anymore.

"I (F) once needed a plunger at work. It was a private single-person bathroom, thank goodness, but there was no plunger in sight. I ended up using the perch stick from the shabby-chic decorative birdcage to break up my monster poop into smaller flushable pieces."

"In addition to the things you mentioned, I also really like his character for not being the stereotypical callous male, and being able to show sensitivity. I'm currently playing through the game now, and I love how when you give him gifts, he gets quite emotional.

"&gt;He also thought it would be good idea to tell me how he ""used"" to be ""swimming in pussy"" and that he and his friends frequently equate women to tacos. ""Sometimes you get tired of having carne guisada every night (an attractive woman) and just want a bean and cheese. (An unattractive woman who they'd fuck but never date.)  

I'd love to know the logic in this. It doesn't seem like negging, since it's not directly about you. Does he think he's coming off as some kind of charitable person?

Also I'm sure you're a fantastic Cheesey Gordita Crunch. "
"Yeah, journalism is such a necessary but dangerous profession. 

The government sent the police and national guard onto the streets to suppress the protests. It ended in the death of several dozen students, as well as tortures and unfair incarcerations. Two of my classmates were taken out of their homes in the middle of the night after intelligence services raided their apartment complex. A bunch of students spent months in prison, too. It was pretty rough. "
I’m hypothetically watching them. 
"Guy turns around and says "" Hey, the pretty girls section is over there."" Right after he and his friend cut me in line. "
This has my vote of the dumbest rule. It's almost is he feels like channel 10 is the TV'S equivalent of putting a car in park. 
"Is there a chance of being friends with them?  I know that's really hard, but at least you would still have them in your life and be able to be close to them.  

I'm just saying, I kind of had a friend where we got along great IMMEDIATELY (like, we were total strangers and then all of a sudden talking like old friends), and we had this really great connection, and I got feelings for them.  

However, they have a long-term S.O., so I knew we wouldn't ever have that kind of relationship.  I asked myself what I would regret: never having a romantic relationship with them or giving up my great friendship with them.  I decided that I liked the friendship we had too much to let go, took some necessary time, and did some mental exercising to distance myself from those feelings.

So think about the kind of connection you have with this person.  It's great that you have someone in your life whose company you enjoy and who you have a fantastic connection with.  But try to see if that connection can be kept the way it is, with you two just enjoying each other's company, without worrying about a relationship.

And you don't have to just be friends--if it's too painful, distance yourself.  "
I sympathise. Texting with strangers on the internet is just awful. So much better to just meet up over a drink - but I guess it's good to meet minimum safety requirements by displaying you're not crazy before doing that...

Staying thin because food was scarce.
"A lot of people spend years at university out of high school and are unhappy because they never thought about what they wanted to do, just followed what was expected of them. 

You’ve had time to develop interest and hobbies and now you’re in college for something you actually enjoy (presumably). Also mature age students always perform better in classes because they’ve done all the partying earlier and are ready to sit down and learn! 

Best of luck!! "
"Living in his hometown. Less than 2,000 people, every one knows your business, people aren't friendly and it's rural, so you have to drive to dine, shop, see a movie. The only redeeming quality is it is a safe place to raise our kids and the school system is good. I fucking hate it here, though. When our last kid graduates (he is a sophomore) I want to sell our home and move closer to the city he works in.  

I'm not joking about the nosy people. A few years back, my brother stayed with us after a major spinal surgery so I could care for him. When he started feeling better, he'd go out for daily walks. One afternoon, about 15 minutes after he returned, the town cop knocked on my door. First thing he said when I answered was ""you got a man in there, Kat?"" EXCUSE ME??? I invited him in, introduced my brother and then said ""adultry might be immoral but last time I checked, it wasn't illegal. That's what you thought was going on, right?"" Asshole. "
"I live on Earth, and I've seen people be disrespectful toward single mothers very often.

They call her a ""whore,"" ""slut,"" etc.

"Cleaning up as I go. I **never** have dishes in my sink, my counters are never messy, I never have trash laying around. (and I have kids, for what it's worth.) Just take the extra second it takes to clean up as you go instead of thinking you'll just deal with it later. It's so much easier and there is zero unnecessary stress this way. "
That's sad. I am glad you realised he was wrong   to have a perception like that.
"A very dorky fantasy: Being pushed up against a wall by a guy, hoisted up so my legs are wrapped around him. Both of us all hot and bothered. He sucks on my neck and just can’t get enough of me. The kissing itself isn’t rough, just intense. Both of us caressing and feeling each other up...

It’s been a long time since I’ve had a good make-out session."
"The inside of his car looks like it could be featured on Hoarders: Buried Alive. Says he’ll do something “later”, especially cleaning up after himself and never does it. Has a pet but does not take care of it. Only hobbies include playing video games and/or drinking alcohol. Doesn’t care about how he dresses (disgusting shoes). 

Basically if he’s lazy or a slob. HUGE red flag."
"Do you like and trust the person you're going to have sex with?  Do you both have an idea of boundaries, what's a must (safe sex) and what's way out of bounds?  Do you both trust each other to stop if one of you says no?"

My mom’s response when I showed her this post [here ](https://imgur.com/a/rgAZEs1) 
"How clean he is. He’s generally a messy individual but when it comes to personal hygiene, the man is thorough."
Oh it was bad. I got home and yelled at my roommates for how shitty it was and they all admitted “they didn’t think he was that cute” but they all had boyfriends and felt bad that I wasn’t dating anyone. So I made a rule they couldn’t try and hook me up with anyone anymore. 
I was about 22 when I realized the song “I saw mommy kissing Santa Clause” was about the mom kissing the dad- not the real Santa.
"My boyfriend and I have lived together for a few months now, but the roommates we lived with before were awful. (Leaving molding dishes in the sink/on the counter, then leaving for 2 weeks without cleaning everything. Then coming home and flipping that we cleaned the house and threw stuff beyond cleaning out) it put a lot of strain on us because we’re both very clean, and there was a lot of toxic energy in that house. I felt like I was constantly grumpy, and all I wanted to do when I got home was curl up in our room and hide. 

Now that we moved out of that hole, and have our own place with no roommates it feels so liberating. We still have bad and lazy days, but our relationship is strong, and having a place that’s OURS makes us both happy and 100X healthier than the anywhere we’ve lived (together or separate) before. "

You’re the first decent looking one around! *now speaking to the cashier* you should give this girl her stuff for free! Pretty girls always get free stuff!  

*glances back at me*

"One of my best friends of over 10 years is super pretty. I used to be jealous of her growing up (not anymore but I had my moments throughout the years). She's very aware that she's attractive. She doesn't gloat or is narcissistic about it. However, she knows that because she is pretty, her standards for dating men is super high. She expects no less than a very fit and attractive man who is willing to spoil her (which is completely reasonable since that person would technically be her male counterpart because she spoils them right back).  

&amp;#x200B;

If we are out, normally men would gravitate towards her and prefer her attention over everyone else in the group. But we are all used to it and we love her anyway because she's an amazing friend. We know that sometimes in life, some people are just more attractive than others lol. "
