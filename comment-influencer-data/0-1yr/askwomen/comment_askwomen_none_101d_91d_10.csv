Always let a girl know if she's got makeup under her eyes or something on her face or in her hair. Also if there's been any accident and she's bled through her pants.
"Exaggerated ignorance of ""girly stuff"". I had a friend who basically had a whole performance to show how little he knew about makeup, nail polish, or clothing. I don't expect people to know a ton about makeup, but pretending you barely know what lipstick is takes things a bit far."
"Waking up over a garbage can filled with bloody vomit from months of excessive drinking. I had never felt that ashamed or physically and spiritually dead in my life. I cleaned up the vomit, and with vomit still in my hair, and still on my clothes, went to an AA meeting. This summer I will have 10 years sober. I will never forget how puny and pathetic I felt on my bathroom floor that morning. Having my two year old daughter find me like that helped too. She hasn't seen it since."
"If a girl is with a guy and she looks uncomfortable, it is ok to go up to her and see if she's ok. Additionally, if a girl runs up to you acting like she knows you and looking afraid, *you bet your ass this girl is your new best friend*."
"As soon as he walks into a room with a window, he stands in front of it, with his hands on his hips and just looks out and continues the conversation we're having. He does it completely subconscious and when I just sit there and smile or laugh it him, he gets really embarrassed and flustered."
my parents can’t just give me money whenever i need it. like if i don’t have money then i just...don’t have it
If you have a falling out with eachother the secrets you have told eachother should remain secret.
"We thank each other for the chores we do instead of being resentful for the ones we “always” do and the other “never” does. 

Sometimes when I’m sweeping and vacuuming or cleaning the toilet I get all grumbly like “He never does this” and then I remember he always does the laundry and grocery shopping and that helps my grumbles."
Acting like they do not have eyes and are physically unable to tell when another man is good-looking.
44 years old. Just realized this year that you can pee in a swimsuit by just pulling the crotch to the side rather than wrestling a wet swimsuit all the way down and back up again.
"After six months of unemployment, I FINALLY GOT HIRED TODAY!!!!!!!!!"
"Put back the $7.47 ground beef, and choose the $7.36 one."
"My 'type' was slightly overweight ""funny guys"" with a soft heart. After three consecutive relationships fell apart (first for distance, second for abuse, third for assuming we'd marry after only a month or so) I started to look elsewhere. 

I had a FWB for a while. Thin and blonde, a couple of years older, less of a comic book nerd and more outdoorsy. We grew close, and eventually became a couple. He encouraged me to get outside and meet new people, I encouraged him to get a job in his preferred area of interest instead of just going into whatever was available.

It's been 11 years. We're married now and I'm very happy with how it all turned out."
"Ordering additional things at a restaurant and then just saying ""oh, we'll split the bill"". What I ordered is what I can afford. I can't afford to split the bill when you've added three more sides and another round of drinks."
"When the girl he used to like was ALWAYS a problem in our relationship because he always seemed more excited to be with her and I wasn't allowed to ""break up a friendship"". And she was innocent yet always starting shit. His parents fly across the country to meet me for the first time and I'm so excited, not only for that but one weekend away from this girl. It was intimate and perfect and I loved them, until he lied to me and took the girl to a one on one lunch with his parents and said he didn't. Found the leftovers in the fridge. Realized I would never feel special to him and it was no longer worth it whether he still liked her or not."
"My dog, Ginger, is weirdly smart. We sometimes watch my brother's dog, Chloe, and Ginger hates other dogs...especially Chloe, who is very clingy and playful. One time while we were watching Chloe, Ginger went to the back door and barked to be let out. Chloe, of course, heard her and then ran over to also be let out. I opened the door. Chloe darted outside, and Ginger turned away and went back to chill in the living room. She barked entirely because she knew I'd open the door and Chloe would leave the house.

Chloe, on the other end of the spectrum, once ate a rock the size of a small egg."
"Vimes' Boot Theory. That is, being poor often means ending up ""wasting"" a lot of money buying lower quality items that fall apart more quickly and need to be replaced, because we can't drop a huge chunk at once on the good item that will last. I literally lived it for awhile: I kept having to buy the same $30 boots that fell apart every six months because I couldn't drop over $100 at once on higher quality ones."
My boyfriend talks in his sleep a lot. One time I see him jiggling and say 'you alright?' And he goes 'hold on' and put his finger up in a hold on motion. I was sat there for 5 minutes waiting for his response before I realised he was asleep
"Pretty much everything else has already been covered by the other commenters, but being upset about a woman being better than them at something is another clear sign. Even a woman being taller than them is enough for some men."
"Last one in bed is in charge of turning the lights off. I cook, she does dishes. Once a month, I let her eat an entire bag of spicy Cheetos instead of eating an actual dinner (mainly because if I didn’t cook for her this would be a biweekly meal for her). No shoes around the house. And if we can get in and out of the grocery store in 15 minutes, we pick a candy bar to share on the way home."
Walking in to my ex fiance in bed with 2 chicks after he'd been without a job for 2 months and I'd been paying *all* the bills
"I work in a childcare and there’s always a dads who gets super insecure when their son wants something pink or girly.

I got chewed out because one kid begged me to let him wear the pink pull ups instead of the boy ones. His dad was so mad at me. Like I was trying to turn his son gay or into a sissy or something like that.

Your kid picked them out not me!"
"I was convinced I would live in Seville, Spain for the rest of my life and marry a Spaniard and have Spanish a Spanish son called Diego. I came back to the UK for a short while to pass my driving test. I kept failing, 3 times in total. During that time I met and fell in love with an English farmer called Will. We are now happily engaged and buying our first home in a beautiful village. We have a dog called Diego!!"
"I dye my clothes  when they start looking too worn. I don’t own many white clothes, because bleach breaks down the fabric."
always bringing extra pads or tampons just in case a girl had a surprise visit.
"“ no unvoiced expectations” if you want or need something from the other person you have to let them know. That way they then have the option to act, ignore or be aware. But from that point on your emotional reaction is warranted. 

How can I be upset at you not unloading the dishwasher if I never told you I expected you to do that?
I CAN be rightfully upset if I told him I expected him to support me through this hard time and I found him fucking off playing video games. 

It doesn’t solve ALL the problems but it does allow you to know where the hurt feelings, that inevitably show up, go and if they are warranted."
"One of his biggest pet-peeves is those binoculars you have to pay to use. You know the ones you pay a quarter to see sights and shit wherever you’re visiting. He goes on loud rants every time he sees one about how stupid it is, how it should be free, how there are other ways to make 25 cents, it takes away from the experience, etc. It’s fucking hilarious. He has a point, but he’s just so damn dramatic about it. I love it."
"One of my cats, Horatio, is scary intelligent. Like we had a contractor over who said so as well and all friends and family who visits are a bit unsettled and amused. 

He’s very vocal and demanding. He knows commands, walks on a leash, and has this overwhelming confidence. Strangers get greeted and get to have conversations with him. He knows how to open doors, pull up the blinds, and manipulate objects to get something he wants. He’s used a feather cat toy to extend his reach and get a paper ball from under the couch. He’s very strange and I view him more as an entity rather than a cat at this point. 

And then I have another cat that licks the wall when she gets confused and has a tendency to kick her own face rather than toys while trying to shred them."
"They boast/lie about conquests that never happened, or imagine you propositioned them just because you talked to them.

They talk about woman in sleazy, immature ways.   The more attractive the woman, the worse it gets it seems.

They refuse to wear anything that isn't overtly macho, like slippers for instance."
"I always had a hard time removing the plastic covering resting on the deodorant (not the cap). I’d use my teeth or break out the pliers to remove it. That is, until my husband, then boyfriend, came to my rescue and simply twisted the bottom to bring the deodorant and the plastic covering right up! Smh."
My husband is a Marine veteran. He will crawl into bed and in a tough under-his-breath way will say “I’m little spoon” and won’t stop until I spoon him.
"Today was the first day in such a long time that I was able to break though the fog, get out of bed, and found myself actually motivated to do something."
I will color my flesh to match my clothing so no one sees the holes
"For the last 4 years, a 60-something year old male neighbour. He lives in the building across from mine, and his unit looks directly down into my suite, with parking lots for his building and my building in between. 

He became obsessed with me a few years ago when I was sitting on my balcony in a bikini. I’m half his age. He left a note on my car asking me to go for an evening walk with him. I didn’t even know exactly who it was from, but he left his name and phone number. 

I ignored the letter, and 3 months later I got a 4 page, double sided, hand-written letter talking about using me as a sexual aid, about his mum finding his ‘girly mags’ when he was a kid, song lyrics, and his study notes on Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus. 

I called the police. The officer seemed skeptical at first, til he read the letter. He then asked if I had a safety plan...

When his partner arrived, they managed to talk to the guy, search his apartment (found no photos of me or binoculars), and told him to never contact me or set foot on my property again. 

He hasn’t, but I’ve not felt comfortable since. I don’t open my blinds more than a sliver so that he can’t see in. I feel watched anytime I’m on my balcony, so I just don’t use it. When I go to my car or taken the garbage outside, I feel like he’s staring. 

The housing in my city is crazy and I can’t afford to move, if I could even find a place to rent. Vacancy rates are super low. Buying is out, as prices are way too high. 

I was told by the cops that he’s unwell, so I’m hoping he’ll move into a car home or keel over so I can finally breathe again."
"Not sure how widely this is practiced, but when I’m meeting a couple, I try to befriend the woman first to put both of them at ease. From this practice I’ve gained many couple friends that aren’t catty, jealous or uncomfortable. ☺️"
"I had a black dress and it had a quarter-size hole on the ass.  I realized it while at the office. A coworker I am very comfortable with basically sharpied my asscheek black so it would be less noticeable. 

This was at a conservative law firm, so anything to save face."
slide across the floor in his socks when i'm in another room so i just see him whizz past the door opening.
"Right at this very second? My SO. It's our day off and we had a date to go hiking with the doggo and I'm all dressed and ready and excited to go but he found an interesting YouTube video so now I'm sitting here, bbq sauce on my titties, waiting for him to get his ass in gear 



*disclaimer: I love this man dearly*"
"My girlfriend had a miscarriage last year at 6 months, she stayed at home after that for two weeks because she wasn't feeling good. When she came back her boss told her to man up a little, that it isn't a reason to stay at home..."
"Well, the last 3 months I decided ""Hey, I should probably eat through the random stuff in my freezer/pantry"" FOR THREE MONTHS. I had so much frozen veggies, and random cans of simmer sauces, rice, etc. that I didn't need to go grocery shopping for 3 months. I would supplement with buying fresh fruit or a salad once in a while at the deli near my work. 

I was so freaking happy when I was able to go to the grocery store last weekend. I'm now going to be buying less frozen/canned items and sticking with fresh items, planning on going to the store more often now."
"Never leave a girl hanging if she hasn’t got toilet paper in her stall. Also, warn the next person in line if there is no toilet paper in your stall."
Ice cubes. He's obsessed with ice cubes. And constantly worries we will run out of ice cubes before the tray is ready. He gets upset when I take some ice cubes without checking the tray. He won't even be going to get ice but will just check the tray periodically. He dumps the ice cubes into this massive ice cube bucket in our freezer. Hes just constantly stockpiling ice cubes lol
"For me, any ""good"" job is one that pays enough I could probably support myself on it.  Any ""good"" job is one that isn't as demoralizing as retail.  I feel like this is a Millennial thing, but many of us have older relatives who complain about ""only"" making $60,000 a year or having to work a ""boring"" office job.  I can't relate to those struggles.  I would kill for that opportunity.  A lot of those people complain their companies reduced staff and now they have to do the jobs of two or three people, which I imagine sucks, but they don't seem to put two and two together that that's why young people don't have access to that sort of job."
"Once or twice a week. For me personally, sex with 
my partner is better the less I masturbate. The more I masturbate, the harder it is for me to orgasm and the less powerful the orgasm is. So for me, a few amazing O’s a week trumps lots of mediocre ones."
"Talking about alpha and beta males.

Refusing to admit that they were wrong."
"If the dog is in one person's lap and they need something (more coffee, another beer) the other person gets it for them. And no calling the dog over to sit in your lap so you don't have to get up."
"I was sitting at a table in the dining area and all but one person at that table were women. It's the first time I'd ever had the opportunity to sit at a table full of women and I was very excited to not be a token for once.

Boss walked by, shaking his head, ""bunch of clucking hens""

Every single day for years I'd said *nothing* about being the only woman or being in a very small minority. Eating all my meals every day with all men, the lounge was full of men, everywhere you went it was groups of men.

Then women had the audacity to sit in close proximity and without even knowing what we were discussing, we were immediately written off?

Fuck that guy."
"My toothpaste bottle, sunscreen bottle, face lotion, body wash, shampoo and conditioner bottles are crushed within an inch of their lives because I’m using every single morsel of them"
"My husband will point out really attractive men and tell me, ""Wow, you'll like that one."" or ""He is exactly your type."" and 90% of the time he will meet my friends' significant others he says something like, ""Wow you two are one good looking couple!""   


I used to think he was being weird, desperate for a threesome, or maybe bi, but its been almost 6 years and I'm 99.9% sure he's absolutely straight and just really enjoys human attractiveness."
Always overpack on underwear when staying away from home
"Just wanna say that everything mentioned above is true but the comments make it look ideal and perfect, but it's not. You are humans, it is likely that those will not be the only things you feel - in a healthy relationship, you still fight sometimes. On occasions, you judge, hurt, compete. Even though you don't mean it and don't want to, it can slip out. Old habits die hard and you make mistakes. I think one of the mlst important things, on top of everything that was already said, is how you deal with those slips - how you communicate, apologize, forgive and cope together when they happen. Honest communication is key imo."
"Yes! Once, as I walked into work in my large office building, a woman rounded the corner about 100 ft in front of me, just coming out of the restroom. The back of her skirt was tucked into the top of her pantyhose. I was just about to break into a sprint to catch her, and it fell out on its own. You must always save someone like that when they need it."
"Usually talking to the kitties and making up what they're saying back to him. Though sometimes he'll yell ""TIME TO PARTY LIKE A SUBURBAN MOM"" and shot gun a lacroix.  Also when he puts on my booty shorts to run around the house and models his legs for me saying ""Ohhhhhhh nooooooo, definitely don't look at who's wearing your shooooooorts"""
"Being alone. I adore my own company. 

Please don’t gossip and assume there is something wrong with me because I don’t seek the same social life you do."
No threats to leave. Ever. If one of us is actually at that point we'll treat that seriously. It really helps solidify our trust and feeling like a team.
"Let other women know about if a person/place is sketchy with women. Girls will always take your advice, so if you know a town and know where the danger is let other people know who might not otherwise."
"In 2004 or 5 a boss asked me if my partner and I had had sex the night before and what were are most frequently chosen sex positions.    It was out of nowhere and in front of three other employees.  

Other women had problems with him and complained about him to each other.  I decided to talk to my line manager about this and all the other female employees denied he had ever said anything that made them uncomfortable or that they disliked it.    

I was more disappointed in my coworkers letting me take the fall in truth.   Though I understand their need to keep their jobs and not rock the boat."
"My boyfriend does the same thing! He’s always just standing and staring out the bedroom window, I always tell him that I’m dating a dog"
I love the way my brother embraces the fact that his 4 year old son's favourite colour is pink. He just came back from a work trip and brought back a bright pink t-shirt for him and he loves it so much. I'm a proud sister.
"When other men mock my boyfriend (who is just a VERY secure silly straight guy)

I'll occasionally hear other guys (and girls sometimes) mock him for things like him being a vegetarian, or applying some makeup to cover some acne before he goes on stage for his wedding gigs, or for having vanity plates with his last name, when he sits crossed legged, or when he's just being himself and doing the ""[Elaine Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY_DF2Af3LM)"" because he knows I'll laugh **every time!** lol"
"I've seen this a lot on social media with the abortion bans popping up, but people saying ""Why don't those women just move states?""

Because it's that easy to save money, to find a new job, new housing, possibly child care. These laws are already affecting the poor and working class. The people it really affects can't afford to just up and move. That's not how life works."
"The guy I’ve been seeing for six months hasn’t called or responded to my reaching out for three days. He called me from his place Friday night to say he’d be coming over Saturday night. He never showed up, never called. Isn’t answering. Have I been ghosted? Is he in the hospital? I have no idea and no way to find out."
"Yeah, when i was in college the amount of people telling me to ""just get your parents to give you an allowance/buy you a car/pay for car insurance/use their credit card for everything"" was staggering. When i told them that was impossible, they were in disbelief. Like they couldn't conceive of a family too poor to give me what i needed at any given time."
"Daily. Or at least 3 times a week. No one does you, like you"
"I grew up sharing a bathroom with my sister and we used the same toothpaste when we were younger. As the annoying younger sister, I always used the last bit of toothpaste and left an empty tube for my sister to replace. I never learned how to break the tamper-resistant seals that don’t have a tab to pull off. 

For years, whenever I came across one of those foil and plastic seals, be it toothpaste or some prescribed medicine in a tube, I would struggle, attempting to peel off the seal using my nails or stabbing at it with whatever sharp object I could find.  A few of years ago, my sister was visiting and saw me trying to open a new toothpaste with my nails because I was too lazy to walk to the kitchen for clean scissors. She took it from me, flipped the cap and pierced the foil and plastic in one go.

My “oh shit” moment was realizing I was doing this whole younger sister thing wrong for years. I probably could have learned a lot more useful shit from my sister if I hadn’t been a lazy, annoying little sister."
"Always share tampons, hair ties, hand lotion or hand sanitizer with a girl in need."
"Apart from not even looking for a relationship (I was going through a messy divorce at the time) 

I would have always said my type was super tall, bigger built men with beards. 
Rough around the edges, into metal and alternative rock, covered in tattoos and into rugby league and likes fishing, camping and outdoorsy things. 

My partner woo'd me off my feet. 
He's 5ft5, Sri Lankan dude, super buff body, no tattoos (yet) prefers 90s soft rock (acceptable) HATES rugby and would rather cut his foot off than go camping. 

And I am head over heals in love with him. Everything about him is perfect and awesome and I'm so glad that he is in my life."
You bring out the best in each other and don't argue over trivial matters. You stay in contact but aren't constantly bugging one another for fear of disloyalty or dishonesty. It feels...calm? It's just nice to know they love you without them even having to say it.
Not me but my boss asks us to use the envelopes from letters we get in the mail for us as scratch paper instead of buying notepads.
"I always dated athletic types, hated beards and hairy guys made me physically cringe. You can probably guess where this is going. I've been friends with this tall big guy with a beard for 10 years. One day I noticed that he smells kinda nice and when I leaned in to smell his perfume, my head spun and I felt all kinds of things. So I started talking to him more, found out we have more in common than I thought and that under his cold facade he's very gentle and caring. Next thing I know I have a huge crush on him and now I'm dating this bearded hairy guy who weights literally twice as much as me, and I totally love it."
"Was working as a waiter at a Pub/Kitchen while looking for a ""proper"" job. One day while leaving the establishment I cross paths with my immediate supervisor, she asks if I'm leaving on a break, I say ""Yes, I have a split shift, see u in a couple of hours!"", and we say bye to each other. When I come back, the managers are tense and snappy. One of them asks to have a word with me. ""MontgomeryBumSnuffle, you've left without telling anyone today and that's against the rules, and frankly you should know better"". I say to her that I have crossed paths with my supervisor while leaving and effectively told her I was out, plus the manager in question set up the rotas and knows before the day started that I was on a split shift. She doesn't believe what I say and lets me know that she asked everyone, including my supervisor, and nobody knew where I was. I tell her to verify the cameras and ask the supervisor again while I start my second half of the shift. And why the hell would ""everyone be frantically looking for me"" when it is made clear on the roster who works and when?  

An hour later she returns fuming and says ""From now on, you must inform a MANAGER before you leave"". She just made this rule up. I ask whether she verified that I informed the supervisor on the basis of the 'previous version of the rule' but to no avail, nothing was going to change her mind. 

That was the last straw in a series of infantile endless interactions I've been having with coworkers there. They could not stomach the fact that I handed my resignation shortly after."
that is a ride or die homie right there
Don't talk about any noises you hear in public bathrooms and act like nothing's happened if you meet at the hand basins.
I just tweeted about this last week bc I remembered it.. When I heard the word “fiancé” I thought it was spelled like feyoncé (Beyoncé) for the first 16 years of my life. Texted a friend one time about my “sisters feyoncé” and didn’t understand what was so funny.
"Im about to move in with my boyfriend. We looked round a *really* fancy place that was amazingly in budget. 

I was gushing about how fancy it was - like the toilet cistern was hidden and the mirror had loads of lights round it. The kitchen was really modern and just looked so awesome. My boyfriend was all like ""yeah its not a big deal me and my sister had en-suites growing up with nicer bathrooms""

Like fuck, I grew up in a caravan and shared a bedroom with my sister. It was cold and there were always spiders.

Let me be excited dammit"
Lol my friend and I had to run up to a group of girls at a bar a week ago cause this guy wouldn't leave us alone. They acted like they knew us since kindergarten and the guy left us alone. Always help another girl/girls out on a night out.
3-7 times a week
"Idk if 'shady' but after I dumped my ex I had unintentionally started dating a guy completely opposite of him looks wise (tall, blond, well groomed, muscle-y) which were all things ex had been insecure about (short, dark hair, hairy, not super athletic, nothing weird or like a deal breaker).

I didn't realize how much of a dig he took that as until he started texting me while I was out in public about how he has seen me and that I didn't need to 'flaunt it' that I'm seeing someone else.

You bet your ass I started casually bringing the new dude to some fun outdoor local events where he would see us that I normally would just skip. 

One time he saw the new guy casually pick me up, I am not a petite lady, and put me on his shoulder for me to see something where I had a great vantage to see my ex throw his beer on the ground and storm off at seeing me being tossed around so causally by this chiseled Adonis."
"Oh shit I remember one time when I was younger I was invited to a dinner at a nice restaurant in NYC because my friend was going. I knew this place wasn't for me, so ordered the *cheapest* thing on the menu and avoided eating other people's food and fancy cocktails even though they offered kindly. I couldn't believe how much they were ordering (growing up, Wendy's was fancy for my family.) Then at the end one guy declares we will all split the check as a gift to the engaged couple at the table who was getting married later that weekend. It was sweet of HIM as a friend but I was mortified! I didn't protest because I was so embarrassed to be poor. Ended up being like a month of groceries for me... Such a culture shock at the time."
"When my ex told me that “compromising was just another way of saying neither of us will be happy”.  He really lived that mantra by refusing to ever compromise, meaning he was always happy and I never was."
"Generalize that most women are after them because of their money. 

It's like a weird, backwards humble brag."
"The bumpy party of a hair pin faces down, against your scalp to help get a better grip on your hair. I always thought it faced up and did it wrong for 20+ years."

"Today I finally got to hang out with some female friends and do girl talk, laugh, have drinks, etc. my boyfriend was too sleepy to hear it all so I couldn’t really express how much this meant to me. I don’t hang out with females often so having the opportunity too made me tear up. I loved it. I WANT to have girls nights, go dancing, drinking with them but don’t bc of lack of female friends. Tonight was refreshing. I’m almost in tears bc I miss this feeling of having girlfriends to gossip with. I love my SO but it isn’t the same as with them."
"Discussing salaries. Employees are penalizing themselves by making their salaries a secret, I'm sure we would all feel more comfortable asking for raises if we knew how much our co-workers made."

"My boss’ boss tried to muscle me into making a product that would replace adjunct professors with videos of unqualified random tutors. I’d worked for unions for years before this job and my SIL was the head of her grad student union at the time, so I tried to tell him it was a conflict of interest and I’d appreciate it if he’d find someone else for the project. He kept pushing and I reminded him that his company had lost a lawsuit about this exact thing like a year ago—why’s he trying to do it again? 

He called me emotional and aggressive and then I got fired a couple months later. I hated that job."
He makes up voices for inanimate objects and animals and they're always exactly how you think they would sound. He talks in the voice about what the animal or thing is thinking. I've had to ask him to stop a few times because I couldn't breathe from laughing so hard. :D
He's such a talker. He'll be wrong about something and talk himself into a corner and I think it's hilarious how he'll realize it and start laughing but keep defending whatever dumb thing he was saying anyway. Just thinking about it makes me smile. I love him so much.
"After a string of abusive relationships, I decided to take a break from dating. I was a single mom and admittedly wasn’t putting myself or my child first. After about a year, my mom encouraged me to try E-Harmony to meet a better caliber of man. I decided to completely change the way I approached dating. I wouldn’t introduce my child into the situation, I would keep the guy at a distance in an effort to identify red flags i had previously ignored, and I would stop believing in the romance illusion. My third date was unlike any guy I had met before. He was safe, kind, and goofy. He owned his own house and business. He totally wasn’t “my type” but he made me laugh. We saw each other often for a fee months before I found myself talking to my brother about him. I told him (naively so) that I thought we didn’t have that spark and my brother called me out. “Do you not have a spark or do you not have drama?” It was like being hit by a freight train. 7 years later, we are married with a little baby boy on the way. We have a beautiful home and he’s been instrumental in helping me raise my 14 year old. Last night, he made me laugh so hard I cried. God, I love my life."
"Back when I was interning for a PR company, one of my male supervisors told me to forward some contracts to a magazine we were working with. I did as I was told, only to be yelled at by my boss for doing it. He then calmed himself down and said ''women can't think rationally anyway, I overreacted''.  My supervisor pretended like he had nothing to do with it."
"Worked my ass off to get myself out of “jr developer” territory but I took a job as a jr dev because it paid very well. 

My sr devs were such unbelievably terrible coders and pretty much ignored every suggestion I made to improve on the pos software we were all building. It constantly broke, it was extremely insecure and all of the tasks they assigned me would just make it break more. On top of they, they were making wwaaayyyyy more than me. 

I’m not a genius or some super programmer or anything but I work way to hard to be ignored by a bunch of idiots."
"&gt;I'll occasionally hear other guys (and girls sometimes) mock him for things like him being a vegetarian

food-based toxic masculinity is THE WORST. like eating meat in itself makes you more of a man.

bro, you didn't hunt that steer with your bare hands. you went and bought it at the same store I got my quinoa at."
"I can't find the exact quote or who said it, but I'm pretty sure it was a famous author. It went something along the lines of ""Don't mock somebody who mispronounces a word, because it means they learned it through reading."""
"It's so weird that being a millennial is like ""I just want a decent job just to be able to afford things everyone should have"" but also we have this ingrained mentality that if we went to school, did our studies, got a degree, we should have been able to get our ""dream job"". I always have to remind myself that the ""dream job"" doesn't really exist.. 

I'm much more about having an amazing work life balance now, which I do have, but it still bothers me when people put too much emphasis on what job someone has. Every time I meet someone ""so, what do you do?"" Okay well I'm in marketing but I'm so much more than my job... Why are people like this? 

I don't ask people what they do anymore for this reason unless they like me. I ask them what their hobbies are and if they have any pets lol."
"I’m one assignment away from finishing my first year of my master’s degree!!!!

At the same time I realize I can never tell my mom 😭"
"Myself tbh. I need to get out of my own head and stop believing my anxiety telling me everyone hates me, I'm easily replaceable, I have no true connections with people, etc."
"I used to do receiving in a warehouse. I volunteered for the position because I enjoyed it and no one else wanted to touch it. I spent months training myself to do the job and improving upon the process, turning a four person job into just me getting it all done by myself. 

A supervisor position over receiving opened up, I applied for it but management decided to promote a coworker who had been working there longer than I had. No big deal. 

Then a few months later, they demoted me to have my supervisor take over because they decided she didn’t know how to do the job well enough to supervise it. They then asked that after they kicked me out of my position to train my own supervisor that they promoted instead of me to do the job I was already doing. That was on a friday. I quit monday morning. Fuck that."

"It bothers me that men think that skincare is a feminine thing. It’s skin. Men have skin. Is it macho to mistreat it, or ignore it?"
"Because online dating is fucking dehumanizing, and I’m not great at organically meeting people. I’m shy at first and I think it takes a bit for people to get my personality."
"For me, it’s communication first. 

My SO is not big on sharing his feelings. We had a tough weekend with his kids, and both of us were exhausted and upset. He won’t bring it up on his own so I sat down next to him and said, “Is there anything you’d like to talk about?” Sometimes he’ll be silent for awhile, and I’ll just sit and wait. And when he’s ready he says what he wants. I don’t push him for information. I don’t tell him he’s wrong. I just simply listen and talk WITH him. Not at him. 

I think when you have communication, respect and loyalty follow. And those three things are the foundation of a healthy relationship."
"I stepped off my school's campus for the very last time.

After 17 years, I will be graduating from college.

I cried during my commute home. I'm proud of myself for being resilient. 

It took a long time but I made it."
"If I'm in a bad mood he'll pull his shorts all the way up to his nipples and do lunges.  

If he's in a bad mood, I'll challenge him to a karaoke rap battle in the basement.  You can't NOT laugh at two middle aged people yelling the lyrics to Eminem and DMX at the tops of their lungs."
"One of my cats is unusually smart. The main thing is, she has much better memory than you'd expect for a cat. Her sense of object permanence is more highly developed than our other pets.

My other cat isn't stupid, he just doesn't apply himself."
"I am having a rough week or so, and I'm currently living like a depression goblin in my cave, and my mum just came and made me a sandwich and a cup of tea. Sometimes it's the small things."

If I know a girl is being cheated on, I tell her."
My female boss told me the same after I had a miscarriage *at work* and asked to go home.
"this family member i see literally every day. 

he sexually abused me since i was young and i’ve never had the courage to say anything because he always tells me that i will end up ruining my whole family’s life with it. he’s always been making my life difficult."
"He speaks to all dogs in the dopiest voice and acts like he's surprised they're around. Every time he sees my dog, it's just ""oh, BELLA?!"" I wish I had a soundbite to attach because it's so cute and always cracks me up"
"We have a code word, “pineapple” for one the other person is getting frustrated or angry and we can sense it’s going to lead to a fight. The word just means we take a 5 minute breather away from eachother and come back to see if we can talk it out more calmly."
Anyone who is overly concerned about someone else's masculinity is insecure about their own.
"It's very rare that I meet people I'm genuinely interested in. When I do, they're usually friends first that fade into something more. Dating a near stranger for the sake of dating in and of itself is not very appealing to me."
I didn’t realize you can use the pad wrapper to wrap up the old one before throwing it away so I just bunched the old one up with toilet paper instead. Wasted a lot of toilet paper. I use a menstrual cup now so I don’t really use pads any more but I was like oh yeah that would’ve been easier to use the wrapper.
"He makes up a lot of different songs about me farting and I always find it hilarious, we're 11 years into our relationship. 

He also honk the car horn when driving through miles of deep forest to let the wild animals know we're on the road."
"Your second paragraph is a huge part of why many men act like they don't notice. My own girlfriend has given me suspicious looks (genuine ones, not the cute kind) because I will say things like this, and it makes me hesitant to be open about my thoughts.

Then again, the reason so many women believe this in the first place is probably because so many dudes play it up so much that they don't notice. The vicious circle perpetuates itself, I guess."
"Last night I cried with laughter as he pretended to suffocate under the blankets and screamed for help. 

Laughing to the point of tears is a daily occurrence in our house, he’s like a 5 year old."
"My laundromat charges by the pound, but your 10th wash/dry is free.  I will wait to wash my jeans/heavy items until I've earned the free wash (this ends up cheaper than DIY coin op, plus I hate sitting in the laundromat for hours)."

I can’t drop everything just like that to go away for a few days.
Telling your employer that you have a mental illness and talking about accommodations for that. Depression is considered a disability but still not really viewed as one or treated as one.
"No dating a friend's ex.

Always giving a tampon or pad to a girl in need.

Don't divulge each other's secrets."
"It sucks because this doesn’t always work out either. There has been more than one item that I finally decided to save up and get an expensive “better” made version so I can stop spending lower amounts more frequently, and it still fall apart in the same amount of time or less. The most infuriating time being two expensive high end bras I bought cause I was tried of $10 Walmart ones. They were supposedly super high quality, but they didn’t even last as long as the Walmart ones. I know this is not always the case, but it makes me so angry to think of what I could have used that money for."
I worked at Starbucks for 3 years and steal colored markers from work. Next question.
"Hearing ""You're so hot, I'd rape you if you weren't my girlfriend"" meant as some sort of compliment from an ex and him saying ""it was just a joke"" as a defense.

Fuck him. I can't put it in words how ashamed I am that I made my family and friends meet this guy."
I wish everyone understood this rule.
"I worked this out when I was 6 and now I feel really happy with myself as a person.  Thank you, internet."
"So, [this is Darwin](https://imgur.com/a/6wfD1mn). Nono, don't worry, he was perfectly fine. He just tried to get into that box, failed, and fell asleep like that.

When I was first choosing his name, I picked it because it meant 'Dear friend'. I thought it fitting, for my new little friend. I was still unsure though. I ended up deciding on the name after becoming convinced that if it weren't for my help, my beautiful Dars would have absolutely have won a 'Darwin award'. 

Between instances such as playing with curtain cords and getting wrapped up in them (and me having to hulk-strength rip them off him to save his life), trying to bury his food bowls in the carpet, picking fights with cats he should have already learned he can't win against (repeatedly - mostly another kitty of mine, who is a gentle girl half his size) and falling out the bedroom window (again, repeatedly. The same window) and similar, we can only conclude that he is not the most intelligent of animals.

He seems to be majorly confused about what a house is, what we are, what he is, and about life in general. He has a permanent look on his face like he is constantly having to work things out. You can see the cogs grinding, and struggling to turn. 

He's absolutely fine, no health issues, nothing like that. Just, not very bright. At all. I've never known a cat quite like him. [We love him very very much](https://i.imgur.com/GqCJOE8.jpg)."
My son. I’m 31 weeks pregnant and he won’t take his damn head out of my ribs.
"What? 

I’ve been a wedding hairstylist my entire adult life. Better grip has to do with the quality of bobby pins. Marianna is a great brand. The bumpy part is there so you can lock it with another pin. You can hold up an entire head of thick long hair securely with just 2 bobby pins as long as they lock into each other via the bumpy ridge. Whether the bumps face up or down doesn’t matter. 

Thats my experience anyway, after doing up dis on literally thousands of women’s hair."
"When I realized the ridges on the back of the toothbrush are for brushing your tongue. 

Still doing it my way though."
"Our dog talks back. She loves to stick her nose through the window blinds and bark at anything that passes by. When we tell her to stop and move away from the window, she looks at us with desperation and instead of barking does lower toned short bursts of noise like she's talking to us. It legit seems like she's trying to convince us why she has to bark at all the things. She'll eventually come down the stairs and sit at the bottom but the moment we are out of sight she goes back to the window."
"This asshole on my bus route. The guy just won't leave me alone. I take this route every morning to go to the gym and it's the only route near where I live that goes to gym. He constantly tries to ask me personal questions and then gets offended when I tell him I don't  have to answer them. Like, I don't owe you anything, motherfucker. Leave me alone. I purposely try to take an earlier bus to avoid him and it seems like now he's on to that and takes the earlier bus too. 

Then today I'm chatting with this new (female) friend I made who is also a gym rat because we hadn't seen each other in a few weeks and this asshole just butts into our conversation. And is completely unaware of what a creeper this guy is and ends up revealing personal information about me. Not a lot, thankfully, but more than nothing than the fake name I gave him. 🤬"
"Unless he absolutely has to, he never sits in a chair. He eats starting up, he studies and reads on the floor while squating, stretching and moving around. He looks like such a goof ball but I love him so much for being so weird."

"I had a cancer scare (right after my boyfriend at the time had gone through some pretty hefty physical and mental problems, that I stood by him through) and rather than support me, he complained to his cousin how needy I was being. That was the beginning of the end. I drove to my appointment, not thinking about the appointment, but about how if I stayed with him this was how my whole life would be... doing everything on my own."
"I had a relationship that was really similar to this and it went on *way* too long. After I broke up with him, I looked back on our relationship and was so disappointed and embarrassed I stayed with him as long as I did. I just couldn’t see it from the inside of the relationship I guess."

things like getting hair and nails done at salons, taking clothing to a tailor, etc are luxuries.

i can't just ""take a month off"" and go hike X trail/region

no, i've never traveled outside of the continent. what money would i have done that with?!

not getting starbucks twice a week isn't going to throw me into the middle class, nor is it going to make me magically able to afford to buy a house."
I didn’t know you could delete both backwards and forwards on a pc until not too long ago.
"When I was 13 I sent unwanted pizzas to my ex's house. His parents came by and spoke to my dad, who grounded me and I never did it again."
"We have an explicit goal to always have the other feel like they are our darling. When things get heated, either of us  can declare ""I don't feel like you are treating me like your darling"" which pauses everything.  Even when we're upset, we want the other to feel treasured and precious."
"Avoid ordering girly drinks, bonus points if they make a show of ""I'm too much of a man to order some fru fru drink.""

Talk endlessly about their penis size. I've been ready to fuck men once the STD test came in. Already been happy with their penis. And they need soooo much assurance that it eventually turned me off. He was convinced he had less sex with his ex because of his size. Nope. That's not the issue. Your massive insecurity is.

Constant bragging and telling these grandiose fictions on things they've ""totally done"". Guy none of us know and never met could back him up if he wasn't deployed right now.

Mock other men, for anything slightly ""girly"".

Anytime a man insists anything resembling what ""girls"" do is bad. Equals major lady boner killer and me labeling them as a misogynistic jerk. 

Women aren't attracted to your toxic masculinity. Someone who knows how to pleasure their partner, work with what they got, and orders a dirty shirley with confidence is sooo much more attractive."
"He dances with his dogs. He has huge dogs, he is below average height so when the dogs stand on the back two legs and give him their other paws, they are about the same height. It's so adorable"

"OMG LOL my boyfriend is the same. He’s a 6’+ construction worker and he’ll get into bed and stare at me until I’m finally like ok do you want to be the little spoon? And he says yes and flips over. 

Except we say “lil spoon” in a baby voice 😂😂 He would die if anyone else knew."
"Insecurities tend to manifest through overcompensation, bragging/boasting, arrogance, anger, belittling others/yourself, excessive fear, excessive curation of experiences, humble-bragging, blaming others/situations/circumstances for their lack of success, etc. There are a lot of things, but they are relatively easy to recognize if you pay attention and interact with someone for any significant period of time."
"You're doing your part to minimize your waste (which is a good thing).  **Reduce**, reuse, recycle, respect."
Oh hell yeah. Dropped him like a sack of potatoes and moved on. Happy in a relationship now that's been goin almost 8 mo now

Not wanting children. As a woman I am treated like there’s something wrong with me for not wanting kids.
"I cook you clean, you wash I fold. Our motto is always “same team”. Communication is always key, it’s better to hurt the persons feelings with the truth than to hold on the resentment for years. A small burn will heal, scoured earth won’t."
When my bf of 4.5 years came home and threw his hat at my face because I was playing my music and didn't turn it off/down fast enough.
"If they act like they don’t care, they don’t. If they want to be around you, they’ll be around you. If they like you they’re going to treat you like it. People who play games do not respect you or take you seriously and most likely never will. Move on."
"If you see a woman in a public restroom who looks like she's lacking confidence about her outfit, hair or makeup, it is absolutely acceptable to say something nice to give her a boost, even if you're a 1000% introvert and she's a total stranger!"
"Not working class/poor anymore, but I was, it always baffled me when people were like, ""Just save money and you won't be poor"". Like... if I had enough money to save, I definitely wouldn't be as poor. That's a true fact, but I can't exactly just make money appear to put into my savings account..."
"Rarely, if ever.  Maybe once or twice a year I bother to try.

It is just completely different sensations and orgasms.  For me, masturbation is just not very fulfilling.  It is just not my thing."

"OkCupid worked out for me (unlike match.com and PoF), and dates were usually to get coffee/tea, take a walk in a park, play pool, or go to a low-key bar."
"My coworker. He pulls this shit with people all the time. 

Yesterday, when he came in to relieve me, he said he wished he’d asked for today off so he could go to a concert. I told him I’d be happy to work a double and cover his shift for him, but he decided he needed the money more, so he’d be coming in. 

Today he called at the last minute to tell me he wouldn’t be in after all, because he had a “stomachache”. 

We’re security guards. We can’t leave our posts until the next person shows up. I’ll be here sixteen hours, having only brought a light lunch, because he said he’d “definitely be coming in tomorrow, no question.”

Asshole."
"When I kept making excuses for his behavior: maybe he forgot, maybe he is busy, maybe he is mad. 

A genuine person will take the few seconds to say: I’m busy or just let you know. 

An actual moment:
When my ex tells me that he is the reason I am where I am in life, that he has given me so much that I need to acknowledge him in everything that I do. 

Like yeah, you were the one busting ass in school and you took my finals and you took on more at work to be a good employee. I realized then I deserved someone that celebrated my hard work and not theirs."
"It feels peaceful. No fighting or tension, just companionship and solidarity. You feel united with the person, like you're part of a team."
"Why I’m 27 and still don’t own my own house because I’m saving for a deposit for a house because mum and dad can’t give it to me. 
I always think it’s a great position to be in to be able to give your child 20-30k deposit for a house and I aspire to be able to do that for my child but not everyone is in that position but some look down on me as if to be like ‘ you don’t own your own house yet?’ always feel like shouting , ‘No and neither would you without your parents so piss off’ but I don’t think that’s acceptable behaviour ha!"
"In college, I asked a girl for some lotion and she whipped out a liter sized pump bottle. It still makes me chuckle."
I always pack underwear like I'm planning to shit myself twice daily.
I keep my house at a less than optimal temperature because a little device tells me to.
When my boyfriend kept commenting on how hot/sexy other women were and how he'd sleep with them in a heartbeat.
"Yup, even when we do chores that are ""expected"" of us, we make a point to thank the other person for doing it. I always do the laundry, because my husband hates the laundromat so much more than I do. I don't think anything of it, but he always makes sure to say ""thank you for washing my work shirts,"" when he comes home and sees the laundry done."
"My first job in my chosen career after college didn't go well. I was very open during my interview that even though I had a relevant degree, I was still very much a beginner in the field and required training. I got the job and was totally let loose without much guidance and zero training. I did my best, but made two pretty big mistakes. When I was getting fired, my boss told me I should give up in that field and consider a different career. 

I was pretty butthurt by that, considering I had been requesting training the entire time I was employed there and never received it. I moved on to a different workplace that was willing to train, and excelled. 7 years later and I'm now a respected professional in the field."
Going braless in public. I was thinking about this earlier today as I was walking braless to check the mail.
So this does exist then!! Any recommendation for black dye? My SO's vampire clothes are starting to read a little grey.
"My dad and I have always had a really rocky relationship from childhood to my teens to adulthood. My parents finally divorced when I was 15 and I had an off and on relationship with my dad. It was very emotionally draining. My dad is a narcissistic alcoholic... the final straw was when I finally broke up with my mentally abusive &amp; cheating ex and asked my dad to never speak to him again. After telling my dad everything he had done to me, I was sure my dad woulda hated him. Instead, my dad chose him over me telling me one day to “have a good life” so I did and we haven’t talked since. I don’t regret it for a single second. Just because someone is family doesn’t mean they’re not toxic and deserve to be in your life. I’m a lot happier now that I don’t have to waste any time on that pos."
"The first guy I dated after my divorce breadcrumbed then ghosted me. I was new to dating and didn’t realize how common it was. I was really upset. I catfished him with a fake profile and fake number, set up a date and then just never showed up and then ghosted."
Brushing my teeth. Apparently dentists recommend you not to rinse thoroughly but to just spit out the toothpaste so that the flouride can do its work.
"That I'm not pregnant! It was such a relief to get that news, but I can't really go around shouting it from the rooftops."
"My boyfriend. Before him, I was dating an asshole (long distance, he's a marine) who cheated on me twice, never wanted to talk, would constantly ignore my texts/calls, and was just overall an ass. Now, my boyfriend's always texting me, I stay over at his place on the weekends, he's always taking me on dates, he's just amazing. We just recently went to the last day of a local festival where we went out to eat, went on a helicopter ride, and watched the fireworks together. It's by far one of my favorite memories with him"
pretty much every single one except the female centric subs.
"When my ex-husband spent our last New Year's together screaming, destroying our belongings, and punching me.

I left him over three years school. No regrets."
"When I realised it made to sense to dump most of my income on my mother's needs and be constantly counting pennies for my own.  
  
At some point I sat down and realised if I had kept all that money to myself, I'd be halfway through paying for a house in my home country."
So proud of you for doing that. That took a lot of work and courage and you’ve done great.
"My fiance is pretty much the opposite of the kind of guy I ever saw myself with. Heck, it took me probably 3 years of living with him to realize I was even into him.

He doesn't have any tattoos or piercings, he can't stand metal or most punk, and he wasn't skinny when we first got together. But he does my sense of humor, like antiquing on the weekends, and he's the one person who can get me out of my own head and calm down. He and I also my the worlds best team, even though we don't always agree exactly we aren't usually too far off and can always find a middle ground.

He's the best craigslist roommate I've ever had, the best friend I've ever had, and hopefully the best husband I ever have."
"He's not allowed to eat the chocolate I buy for myself, or if he does he has to replace it and leave it exactly how I left it so I wouldn't know.

Made this rule cause he will eat an entire sharer bar in one go and I like to eat it in little bits and save it for when I wanted it. Had to buy my own chocolate and make this rule because I would come home after a hard day and want chocolate and I wouldn't have any left. He told me the other day that pretty much every chocolate bar I've bought he's normally finished and replaced a few times over 😂"
"""You have no idea how replaceable you are."""
"I currently have 15 nearly empty candles sitting on my kitchen counter with boiling water in them so I can get the last bit of wax out and make a new candle out of it. Candles are expensive, there’s plenty left in there that I want to use lol."
"Not dress or groom themselves properly because that's apparently ""gay."""
"&gt; Do you not have a spark or do you not have drama


Ohhhhh man, I’m so guilty of this"
Toilet paper is actually supposed to be flushed and not thrown into the trash. The house I grew up in had a crushed pipe which led to floods so we couldn't flush the toilet paper. Parents never explained this to me so I grew up thinking throwing it out was normal.
My job.
I can hear my dad yelling “I’m not paying to cool the entire city!”
Chloe nooooooo 😂
"I went abroad for a month and packed light on EVERYTHING, knowing I’d do laundry. But you bet your ass I brought 35 pairs of underwear."
We do something similar but our code word is “I can tell we are getting frustrated so let’s take 5 minutes to calm down.”
Exaggerated ignorance is my biggest pet peeve ever. I never knew the name of it. My slightly older coworker never misses a chance to mention he doesn’t know who Drake is or what Snapchat is because he likes to hate on the younger generation as much as possible. It’s super cringey.
"This might be a weird one, but we ask before we randomly touch each other (at least half the time). Had to set up this rule because he loves excess cuddling/touching, but as much as I love him I really need my space. So now in respect to me, he asks before suffocating me in hugs 😊 

It might seem like a weird rule, especially since we’ve been together 5+ years. But only recently did I realize I shouldn’t just endure cuddles for his sake. He WANTS me to enjoy them, not to make me uncomfortable."
"I’m a Spaniard from Sevilla who always thought I’d end up dating a northern or English man, and here I am dating an Italian guy."
"More often than I’d like to admit, I find out a word is not pronounced like I thought it was. Epitome, for example, was a shocker. I’m still struggling with regime."
"I had a woman boss who decided, in front of everyone in the office, to give me ""fashion advice"". She said that I had great legs and that if I wore shorter skirts with heels, I would get more people asking for my classes. She also said that I should wear make-up daily, because although I looked good without it, it made me more desirable. Being desirable was more important to getting clients than teaching classes well."
"&gt; setting them up for failure at the first sign of resistance in the real world.

Does this happen, in your experience? 

I agree with everything you said, but I’m my  experience, it hasn’t been the case. I personally saw 5 different friends that were this during my college years. Didn’t pay a single cent of anything. Lived off campus in enormous, incredibly expensive apartments paid by mom and dad. They would use their parents’ money to throw huge parties.  Always buying crazy expensive food and clothes. It took them like 6 years to graduate because they always did the bare minimum. 

I used to think like you: “oh boy, when they graduate, they’re in for a shock.” 

But when they graduated, it’s like a switch turned on, and they got their shit together. They got great jobs and are not making 6 figure salaries in their late 20s/early 30s. 

I’m low key jealous of that. I grew up in extreme poverty. Paid everything in college. Got loans, worked 2 jobs. and finished. It was tough as hell. And by all measures, these guys will never face and will have never faced anything like that in their life. 

My point is, has this been the case for you? 

I saw this quite a bit with the typical frat boy crowd. except they graduated and got shit together. 

I kinda always just dismissed it to one of those “life is unfair” kind of thing."
"I agree, it's great that you were ready to sprint in order to help her. That happened to me in my last year of highschool except and a girl literally took a picture of it and sent it around on Snapchat :,) Good times"
"And maybe, just maybe, people don't want to have to leave the area they've built their lives in because of awful laws. Crazy, I know, but some people want to have both friends and agency in their lives."
"Never separate and let them ""get home on their own"". Stay together until you both leave.

If one friend embarrasses herself or you can just tell she feels self conscious about something she just did, laugh and make it sound like what she said was great then change the subject to get the focus off of her."
"In my opinion, I believe it means just being patient and working on yourself before someone else. This and being able to be completely dependent on yourself before you share a life with someone else."
"My partners are surprised when I say I can get myself to orgasm in under two minutes. 

But yes, I’m at a few times a week."
"Ive been at my job for 1.5 years and my boss still doesn't think im worthy enough to be promoted to the next stage. Meanwhile, an employee hired 6 months after me was recently promoted, despite being less qualified. Currently looking for a job."
"I kinda got that too. I hid my tattoos for the first little bit, and then I started to talk more openly about having them and getting more but still covered them up. My boss said to me that he would never date a woman with tattoos, it ruins the whole thing he said. He also said he was very surprised that I had tattoos. Later that week it was international women’s day and he sent an email throughout the office (he’s the only man) saying that there should be an international men’s day as well (he framed it as a joke). ‘Twas a rough week."
"TIL I am a dog... 

I knew I related to them too much somehow"
"This. I've been using the cup for 2 years already, but instead of throwing out the tampon stock I had (never going back to this) I just always have spare ones in my purses and makeup bags. At least once a month there are situations that this has been useful"
"Not hiding pads and tampons and not acting like bleeding out of our vagina is some secret 

Dressing however we want to dress"
All of them.
Making fun of other men for crying/expressing their emotions.
"An ex of mine would never care about my pleasure during sex. No oral or anything but demanded it from me. Not sure why I stayed with him for as long as I did. Never again.

My husband is a very thoughtful partner and I love it."
"Points at crows and asks 'what kind of dog is that' 

It's dumb but I bloody love it"
"Yes! 

""Maybe don't be in a room with him alone.""

I didn't have to say why, and or wasn't asked (professional situation) but was probably heeded. I'd listen if someone told me, too."
"Anytime my boyfriend is about to tell a story he religiously begins the story with ""so check this out right..."" and it is so cute to me and makes me laugh :)"
"It gives off the “I’m not flirting, I’m genuinely interested in what you have to say” vibe 

Interestingly the opposite usually happens to guys when women mention boyfriends"
It’s not that I don’t wanna go on a pre-uni holiday with you guys; I financially can’t and my family isn’t in a position where they’re able to fund my trip.
"It's so inconsiderate, you're essentially subsidising their lavish lifestyle. 

I made this mistake once before, now I have no shame in being that annoying one who wants to only pay for what they had."
"A bit on the lighter side: I was listening to ""Time Is Running Out"" by Muse  and feeling it super hard. It occurred to me that was not a healthy way to feel about my relationship. Broke things off a week later (took a couple tries; it was a total shitshow)."
"my husband is really smart-annoyingly so; but, he can't seem to manage (bother) to learn common phrases or idioms and chooses to make up his own that often make no sense e.g. ""interesting said the blind man""  ""i'm tired as a horse"" it's adorable and hilarious."
"Some people are saying that means you are not compatible, and that can sure be the case sometimes, but it doesn't *have* to be, it depends on the people involved and their needs.

Understand that everyone is different and don't take it personally."
"I also hate the idea that people have that if someone is poor, they don't deserve any sort of luxury or joy in their lives. Like unless you live like a pauper 24/7, you're mismanaging your money. They deserve the occasional treat and happiness too."
"most of them are broke as shit and go on about women using them for money after they paid 2€ for her coffee (at their absolute insistence of course, because the days were better when ''men acted like men'') and she didn't see it going any further."
"My neighbor. He's a sexist dude and if I have to explain what's wrong with my car one more time I'm going to flip my shit. 

I also dont want to be set up with his son. Be told I need to have kids because I'm a woman. And I definitely dont need a man to fix my car. I need a job so I can pay someone to fix my car or buy another one."
"I hope you have someone safe that you can talk about this with; a friend, teacher, counselor, therapist, etc. Please know that he is wrong; HE ruined your life and your family the moment he abused you. No part of this is your fault. Please pm me if you need to talk. Here is a site with a list of relevant resources: https://www.rainn.org/national-resources-sexual-assault-survivors-and-their-loved-ones."
"In the morning of days I don't make lunch for work I call the front desk or walk by and chat with them to see who is having lunch meetings and where. Then I go to the room when the meeting is over and I get the left over lunches from the organizer. They always have extras and no shows.

Usually the boxes are just sitting there and the caterer would come collect and throw them out. Nope. Free food."
"You know those laser pointers that cats and some dogs go crazy for? Yeah usually you turn on the laser pointer and your cat's supposed to chase the little red dot around the house because of their hunting instinct. They can do this for hours, depending on the cat.

When I first brought my cat home I had it ready to use right away.

She chased it around for like 20 seconds, and then she stopped, looked me dead in the eyes, and then *jumped up to catch the laser pointer in my hand*. And when she realized that I she wasn't going to succeed (I pulled my hand away) and that the little red dot wasn't actually alive, she just said fuck it all and stopped chasing after it.

I think it's pretty incredible that she thought to trace the source of the dot in my hand rather than trying to hunt the red dot itself."
"For me it’s the unwavering confidence in my trust for my partner. I know that I’ll never be judged or abandoned, and I have compassion for the yucky things that inevitably come up in a long term relationship. We’re both whole entire people, we may not always see eye to eye but I KNOW that we’ll get around it. Even in my lowest moment, I’m comfortable being around my partner. I can look, feel, and smell like absolute garbage without fear. It’s the deep sense of safety. We talk through our feelings until we’re blue in the face. Also, as a couple in our mid twenties, we already see therapists for our own personal issues and we go to therapy as a couple to constantly improve on our communication skills. It’s never too early!"
"I can't just go back to live with my parents. I wouldn't even dare ask for them to help me with rent. No. It's actually not torture to take the bus. No, I don't actually need a car. No. I'm not some deranged lunatic because I take the bus, and I judge you harshly for your close minded view on public transportation.

Yea, your gap year must have been fun. No, I couldn't just stay with my parents, save part time for a year in Europe. No, my parents are not paying for any of my wedding, and I'd never ask. 

Yes, I avoided college largely because of loans. No, my parents couldn't help me with college. I couldn't qualify for private loans because my parents can't cosign. No, my family friends are broke too.

My gifts are things I need, like clothes. I couldn't imagine my parents ever making me enough to gift me a $1K iphone. And if they had that much, they'd rather give me the money. My knock off Android phone does everything I'd need from your iPhone that breaks when you look at it funny. Mine has been through the ringer and the screen hasn't cracked.

I'm quite happy with my thrift store clothes and would die of a heart attack if I paid $100 for a single purse.

No. I'm not in fact cheating the system by being poor. Unemployment benefits were less than $200 a week. Please tell me how I'm supposed to afford all my bills on that and *no* food stamps.

I in fact can't afford health insurance, and it's telling to me who you are as a person that you think health care is a privilege. And that poor people deserve to be seizing in shelters because their epilepsy medicine is too expensive. It shows me you're a cruel heartless person if you don't see this as something akin to a 3rd world country crisis. Countries in **AFRICA** have criticized us for this very issue.

No. Homeless people can't just get a job and a house. Being poor is a constant cycle. You learn the terminology just so you can ignore it. As soon as I say ""Cycle of poverty"" you'll dismiss me as someone who chooses to be poor.

My boyfriend was homeless for 8 years. He was only able to get on his feet with me and many other people's help. You can't live in this city on your own, and that's becoming true of so many cities in America. Where it's still legal to pay people as low as $7 an hour (and many do).

No, most minimum wage employees *aren't* teenagers. Most of them are 30 and up who have a family to provide for.

And teenagers deserve to be paid well for the exact same job someone else is doing. And regardless if you're a plumber, or CEO, you deserve to make enough to provide for basic necessities.

**WHICH WAS THE WHOLE POINT OF MINIMUM WAGE**

You're completely missing the point when we ask for $15 an hour minimum wage. And you make a stink about why should McDonald's employees make as much as EMTs? Usually coming from someone who makes 50k+ a year.

You're absolutely fucking right. Why do people who have one of the hardest jobs. Are *only* getting paid 30k a year? Why should emergency specialists who literally save lives, get paid so little?

You have this ""Fuck you, I got mine"" mentality. Buying into trickle down economics. And you think with the national debt there's a limited amount of money, and your money will be cut. 

No. It. Won't.

It's about making a bigger pie. People who save lives should have healthcare for the mentally traumatic job, and should have enough money to take a mental health day without having to worry about affording their copay.

But that's complicated and messy and requires empathy. And it's far easier to just blame poor people for being poor.

Sorry, this is definitely one of my hot button issues."
"Bonus story!

All of the new guy's friends were also ridiculously hot (German and Polish exchange students) and at one of these outdoor events he came over to try to talk to me when I was momentarily by myself.

New boyfriend's friends must have seen that my ex just radiated shitty body language as he was coming over and four or five of them came up behind me, one being a 2.00m tall soccer player but all over 1.8m and they ask 'Is he bothering you? We're taking you with us. You (*points at ex*) are not to follow.'

Ex just squeaked his apologies and left, I brought them drinks later and we all had a laugh about it."
Omg. This never even occurred to me. Early 30s here.
Guinea pigs are known for the Big Blank Stare. Like their tiny minds need to reboot.
"My macho level is so high that I refuse to put on any clothing or footwear at all. Real men just have to get their bare skin used to freezing and heat wave conditions if they want to be considered manly by me. Of course, the law is too girly, so now I'm wanted for indecent exposure or whatever. Ha! The grease will make catching me difficult."
"If I might make a suggestion, ""Are you OK?"" is a little blunt and requires a possibly-anxious person to make a decision Y/N that might have many consequences. But how to employ subtlety in this situation? You could try using the old PUA technique: ""Hey sorry to barge in like this but could you settle a bet for us? Actually, dude, do you mind if we borrow your date for just a minute? Great, come with me, honey...""

Not that I know anything about anything..."
"A safe word for everyday life. For example when my partner is teasing me and I really don't find it funny anymore, I just say the safe word and we take a time out. Maybe afterwards we discuss why it got that far, but usually the one who got safeworded can see what went wrong."
"She called me to go to work on my day off, which she did a lot and I often went in, but when I politely told her I was too busy to go (for the first time) she raised her voice and demanded to know what I'm planning to do all day because it was semester break and she knew I didnt have classes. As if she caught me lying or something and boy was I in trouble now. I wish I had just told her what I really thought of her bc I quit not long after that."
"Hey, no problem. In all seriousness, it was the best decision of my life for those babies. I have 3 well-adjusted children who don't have to wish their mom wasn't sick all the time and yelling and can't drive. I almost ruined a bunch of lives. If I can do it, literally anyone can. I was 2 years deep into a relapse from trying to get sober 4 or 5 times in 10 years. I was dying from alcohol. Today I am not. Thanks for the comment."
"No matter how busy we are, we always eat dinner together. Doesn't matter if its a bowl of cereal we take the time to sit and eat and talk to each other."
"My husband does this too. Lately it is for our cat, a Russian blue male kitty cat. He went downstairs this morning to grab cat food and kitty litter from storage and the cat of course meets him on the stairs (food) and he says “you get me things for both entrance and exit. Good human” in a thick Russian accent and I lost it."
"My union rep told me that they agreed with my case and felt I had been deliberately misled by management regarding a promotion... but that they weren't going to do anything about it because I didn't have enough seniority. I remember sitting there and having this moment of calm, clear realization that I was quitting my job as soon as humanly possible."
"TIL I’m not frugal :/ the only thing I can think of is  just trying to do all of my errands in one swoop, so I drive less."
Telling a stranger if her dress is tucked into her underwear! Way less embarrassing to find out in the washroom instead of walking out and having a friend tell you after you've had it that way for a while.
"This is sort of related, but I work in government and my husband works part-time in a coffee shop. I always have this inward struggle when someone in the office asks what my husband does, because it's not really an 'acceptable' career for a man in his 30s, especially considering most of my colleague's partners are lawyers, academics, etc. My husband previously worked as an IT manager but the stress of the job and the lack of work-life balance, coupled with pre-existing health concerns, ended up causing him to have serious health complications. So these days he works part-time, brings in just enough income to cover our rent while I pay the the rest of our expenses, and is generally much happier living a low-stress life that isn't impacted by major work responsibilities. And that works perfectly for us, because like you said, my husband is *so much more* than his job. But the look on my colleague's faces when I say ""oh, he works part-time as a barista"" gets to me, even if it shouldn't."
"My boyfriend recently broke up with me, just a week ago, and I've taken the better yourself prospect. I got a new tattoo, I'm getting my hair done, I'm purging my closests and enrolling in school to get a degree. I'm even looking at getting a better job so that I can go through school with no debt! Dont let then break you down and you've automatically won."
"Corollary: exaggerated ignorance of female biology and anatomy as well. And they’re proud of it. “I know nothing of your lady bits,” as if that’s helpful to anyone. 

Had an exBF who was horrified when o started discussing my lady bits in the context of the birth control being used as well as our sex life in general. He told me it was none of his business. I said if that’s the case then we aren’t having sex anymore because my sexual health is very much his business and vice versa. It didn’t last much longer for multitudes if other reasons but that was telling. (He also though I’m a squirter, although that’s never happened in my life.)"
"Big outings, even going out to eat, need to be planned at least a week in advance. I need to have time to add it into my budget. I can't just do whatever I want whenever I want if it costs money. 

Another one: especially because of cultural norms in the area I'm from (southeastern US) - it's generally expected that if you're at someone's house hanging out at meal time that they will feed you. I am lucky because I'm ok enough to be able to feed my friends if they're over and I always offer. It's not a burden. But, I hang out with some friends that have 2 kids, and if they haven't specifically asked me over for a meal, I ALWAYS ask if I need to go grab something to eat. Normally it's not a big deal and they have plenty, but it's a courtesy because sometimes they don't and this way they don't feel bad for not offering. But people with money wouldn't even consider this."
Guy here (not sure if that’s cool but here it goes) it’s funny reading that as I find bringing my girlfriend up in conversation actually makes them more relaxed. And I usually do that naturally with new people because I just ramble lol
"He fell for another girl we were friends with and I hooked up with her at a party we were all at and then started dating her. It wasn’t specifically to get back at my ex, I actually really liked the girl. But I won’t pretend his irritation wasn’t a nice bonus."
Damn...I hope you're doing better.
"In my experience you very seldom ask outright if she’s ok. You don’t want the man she’s with to get his hackles raised. There’s many other ways to ask if she’s ok, even if it’s as simple as “oh my gosh you look super familiar, have we met?”"
"My mother in law uses Rit and has had pretty good success with it. They have a guide on how to dye which kinds of fabric which colors on their website. I think for black you might have to boil the dye, but I'm not sure."
"My bf naturally has a super deep, very eloquent voice and way of speaking. He routinely gets told (often by strangers) that he should go into radio or voice acting.

The second he sees a dog, he will stop MID-SENTENCE and raise his voice up 2 octaves until he sounds like peewee herman. Totally involuntary."
I read this as taking his face off and got VERY concerned
I can relate to this.  I go on meaningless rants all the time and I’m sure my wife is tired of hearing them all the time.
BUT HOW ELSE WILL I ALERT YOU TO ALL THE THINGS I HAVE PROTECTED YOU FROM
Can that guy be my dislocated left patella? Because fuck that guy.
"My husband does this, too, but in his native language which he doesn't speak too much anymore so it's extra strange. I think he dreams in Portuguese."
Does my cat count? I love her!
Love at first sniff
"This depends where you are in the world. In some places, sewer systems can't handle it at all (not just individual houses). People should check before they travel!"
Fuck. I'm sorry.
"This - there's sooooo few things made with quality anymore.  Everything's made to fall apart in 6 months so you have to keep repurchasing.  My husband is a maintenance guy for the city parks department, and does a ton of walking.  When he started his job several years ago, he dropped almost  $200 on what was supposed to be high quality work boots by a well known and trusted brand, but they were trashed by the end of the first year.  He replaced them with $25 Walmart boots that lasted longer.

Why even bother anymore with ""nice"" things."
"You people are all thinking small, always min-max when creating characters.  I'd max out ambition, intelligence, and charm, give myself a serious supervillain.  Spouses of supervillains usually end up on nice private islands when the world ends."
"It feels like a partnership. Two equals who can communicate, are happy, are kind and share their lives together. It feels natural, like something your body and mind were meant to do. You aren’t worried or stressed being around them and when something comes up that needs to be discussed, you aren’t scared or on edge when you need to work through it. 

It feels like a give and talk that both people reciprocate because they *want* to, not because they are being forced to compromise. It is truly lovely and worth waiting for."
"Being a shoulder to cry on. It's not that I don't want to help or don't care, it's that the same calm demeanor that makes people feel comfortable confiding in me, also means that they don't always realize how troubled I am by the sometimes horrifying stuff they unload on me. I am happy to help, but there is a lot of stuff I desperately wish I could unhear."
"Refuse, reduce, reuse, repurpose, recycle. :)"
Bulk buy things on the internet. That’s sort of a weird thing to do where I live (Amazon is not really a thing here). I’ve bought stuff ranging from toilet paper to dish detergent. It saves me money and the effort of carting that stuff home on my bicycle.
"United Sisterhood of drunk girls. We meet in bar bathrooms. We give the best compliments and have each other’s back no matter the situation. Whether your date starts to go south or you need a tampon, we’ve got you. 

I came here to make sure someone said this. One time during college, the popular local bar had a broken toilet and the only other stall was missing its door. The drunk girls in line would form a human door to allow each person privacy to pee. It was the most supportive situation of women helping women that I’ve ever witnessed."
"If the argument won't affect you in three months, make up. I just had an arguement with my friend but i adore her and i know she didn't mean to hurt anyone. So we talked, had coffee and laughed it off together. Also my rule is if i see a woman with smudged makeup, i quietly tell her about it so it can be fixed. Announcing it is rude and not telling her is mean."
"It's very hard to upset me, I just tried telling him that my supervisor told me what to do but when he denied it, I just told them ''God bless 1964.'' referring to the Civil Rights Act that would allow me to file a complaint and eventually sue them. My boss figured it our *real* quick, he apologized and I was assigned another supervisor. When my internship was done he wrote me a recommendation letter that was so nice and over the top, not even my mom could've written it like that"
Well it is the currency of the future.
"My foray into seeing women when I first came out was using dating apps.


I had always been into girls that were cut from the same cloth as me....athletic, ""work hard/party hard"" types. 


I ended up swiping on a girl who was not much of that at all. Very quiet, artistic, and a homebody. We met up for a drink and spent a long night together and boom that was it. Over three years later, it's still very much true that we compliment each other so well and together are such a good balance as couple. I can't imagine the therapy bills and the chaos if I had stayed within my initial preferences!"
"When I realized that I felt like a stranger in my own house and that I dreaded coming home.  It made me realize just how bad the abuse was that I had been living with for the past 10 years, and that I could choose to end it."
"I feel that. Our boss refuses to buy us post it notes because ""paper and tape will do"""
Video them for a parody of pinky and the brain
English is his second language so he says things that don’t translate perfectly or says it in his accent. he once called the g spot the g “place” and i fucking lost it. He makes fun of my accent speaking Spanish and now I can’t help but laugh that he says shit and sheet the same way. “STOP STEALING ALL THE SHITS IM TRYING TO SLEEP” I just melt whenever it happens bc of how cute it is
Maybe daily? A quick one before I go to sleep works way better than any sleeping pill.
At one of my old jobs they would wash the zip lock bags and reuse them.
Refusing to hold an infant/child when passed to you
"I cut my father out of my life when I was 23. My only regret is that I didn't do it earlier in life. At the encouragement of my mother's side of the family, I called him to let him know my grandfather died. They had been close at one point. When he answered, he pretended I was a stranger because he was around people who didn't know I existed. He called me back, and I refused to let him talk. All of the grief I was feeling, plus the years of neglect and abandonment spewed out of me. Things I hadn't been able to say my entire life. Then I hung up, and that was the end of it. 

He died two years later, and we never spoke. I found out he died months after the fact when my mom googled his name. Our relationship hurts to think about, but I don't regret it. I deserved a better father, and he deserved to know that too."
He makes this really cute expression where he'll smile but quirks the corner of his lips up in the weirdest way and it looks so funny but adorable at the same time. On the other end of the spectrum he'll just scream into random plush objects like a towel or a pillow for no reason when he's in a good mood??? Idk why I find it endearing but I do??? Love is weird.
GOOD LUCK PROVING IT NARC
"My husband and I set this rule when we started talking about marriage. We never threaten to leave or joke about divorce at all. It just doesn't exist. We are til death do us part, so we do joke about killing each other. It's funnier than it sounds."
"That when I say, I ""need to choose between food and gas this week,"" I'm being serious. Or when I'm having a panic attack over not making rent and say, ""I'm trying to avoid being homeless,"" I mean it. 

I've been on my own since I was 17 (28 now). Ten years later I'm making enough to keep living but people don't get that if I can't make rent, I don't have a rich family to move in with or someone who has a basement I can crash in for free. I'd be living out of my car. I can only borrow money from a bank, I can't run to family to help me out. 

It's humbled me but man, privileged people sometimes don't get that I'm not joking."
"Yes! And I hate feeling like the cheap asshole that insists on separate checks, but if I budgeted $20 for dinner, I can’t afford $35 because someone else ordered cocktails, appetizers, dessert."
"My Westie faked a leg injury so that I would carry him back from a walk. After I did he ran through the hall, up onto the couch and just looked at me like ha got ya! So I'd say he has his moments of being pretty smart."
"Ugh, if that’s the right way I am going to just get cavities. I absolutely hate the taste of toothpaste. (I do use fluoride rinse so hopefully that makes up for it?)"
"Hey! That sounds exactly like my fiancé 🙄

He’s still trying to get me to go backpacking with him and as a girl who’s never been camping it’s a tough sell."
"So, I was an archery technician for a little while and experienced the machoest insecure macho men.  For those who don’t know much about bows or archery, compound bows have a pull weight of up to (most commonly) 70lbs. Now, most experienced adult men shooters will shoot with their bows set to 70, but if you have never shot before you are NOT going to START at 70. I would have these “big and strong” guys come in and even though they had never shot a bow before,  would insist on me setting the bow to 70lbs (though I suggested otherwise) because that’s what their friends’ had. I always got a kick of watching them turn red in the face as the attempted to pull the bow back, and they always ended up defeated. What was worse than that though, was when the fathers would come in with their preteen sons and EXPECT them to pull the same weight that they did, and start shouting at me when I suggested that pulling that much weight would not only be counter intuitive for a beginner, but could also do permanent damage. It was so so sad, because I couldn’t imagine being these fathers’ children and the wives always seemed so helpless."
"My dad was unhappy that my then-boyfriend came to visit me (and stay with me) when I was studying abroad. He threatened to commit violence against my boyfriend and my boyfriends family and ruin his family business. He also threatened to not continue paying for my education if I didn't break up then and there.

Guess who's happily married and 100% financially independent now?"
"The dude who didn’t like me back. After realizing my feelings were one-sided I pulled away for my own sanity. Now he makes even more effort to be a part of my life. But of course, on his terms."
"Don’t just keep walking when you see a woman or girl in a potentially dangerous situation. 

Years ago I was leaving a restaurant with a group of friends, all women. In the parking lot we saw a young man pulling a resisting girl into a car. Two of u went over and loudly said, “Let go of her!”  Not letting go, the man said, “Stay out of it. This is my girlfriend!” I replied, “Then you won’t mind letting go of her arm.” To my great surprise, he let go of her arm. We offered her a ride home and she took us up on it. 

To this day I remember that action that my friend and I took with such pride and amazement. Who knew I could speak with such authority? Not me. 

I helps alleviate my guilt about a time even earlier, when I was a teenager. I saw a man dragging a woman out of the mall. I and everyone else stopped and just meekly watched it happen. I feel so ashamed. I have to remind myself that I was very young and the adults around me didn’t intervene, either."
This whole story makes me unreasonably happy
I would way rather have a harder more excited boyfriend that lasts only a few minutes than one that is struggling to keep it up or takes forever to come.
"Mine will hike his pajama pants (excuse me, ""house pants, because he doesn't wear them to sleep, but around the house) all the way up to his armpits with no shirt, hunch his back over, and make his mouth look like he has no teeth. Then he'll say, ""This is gonna be me in 20 years, so you better get used to it now!"""
"Definitely a privileged move on that one guys part. 

I’m financially pretty stable but what I don’t understand about dinners like this is HOW DO PEOPKE EAT SO MUCH?!

Like, portion sizes are already so big in the US I rarely finish my plate as is. When I’m out with people and they want to order all this stuff my first thought is “do we need it/who’s gonna eat it?”"

"She's brilliant, bold, and powerful. She has a PhD, and she's an Assistant Professor at a top tier university. She commands respect in her field. 

That's why it's adorable when she throws a mock temper tantrum and literally beats her tiny, angry fists against the bed while going off in an agitated, exaggerated, high pitched voice about whatever has vexed her."

"my ex - physical and emotional abuse, fraud, cheating, rape

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I spent another evening dreading bed time. I dread sleep because my dreams wake me up. All these mashed up versions of different incidents with ex form the basis of my horrendous nightmares. Then I wake up at 3ish/4ish. And I just lie there crying. Last night I woke at 3am. A spider in my bed crawled across me and terrified the sh\*t out of me and I thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown. I couldn't catch it and it slipped off and I was terrified and sobbing. I took myself to my brother's room - which is FULL of my things (I shared an apartment with NEX and 6 years worth of belongings are in my brother's old room). So there I was 33 year old me, lying in my brother's room over-thinking until I finally dropped off.

Today I had a dental appointment. I was lying back in the chair and tears just rolled down my face. She stopped and handed me a tissue and I had to be an actress and pretend lying there with my mouth open had made my eyes water (WTF?)

I came home, and just felt so much angst and upset and depression that I just walked out. It was pouring heavily with rain but I just kept walking. I went to a chemist and bought Nytol sleeping pills. Who knows if these are going to make my dreams worse or better, I just hate being awake so much and I am developing this fear of the evenings and what is to come."
"I use a sharpie pen on my scuffed black work shoes. Eat it up, wear it out, make it do or do without!"

"TMI ahead: 

The first night I slept with my cup in I had a sex dream and the contractions pulled the cup up too far and onto its side so I could juuuust barely touch the nub to pull it out but couldn't get a good hold or enough force to remove it. Half hour later, in tears, I wake my husband up at 730 on a Saturday to come fish the damn thing out of me cause my friend is picking me up to go to the farmers market. So yeah, that was the first and last time I used a diva cup."
"Wear clothes that fit - regardless of your size. Sometimes this means a trip to the tailor to get it right.

"Holy shit thats so blatantly and shamelessly rude, and very unprofessional."
"- If a girl who is a total stranger comes up to you and starts talking to you like she's known you for all your life, in a public place - roll with it. She is likely on her own and a creep is bothering her. We need to keep each other safe as well as ourselves. Also, on the flip side, if you see a girl in an uncomfortable situation, go over and act like she's your best friend. 

- Extra Tampons/Pads if you use them. If you don't have any on you, you do your best to help a girl out  

- Toilet paper on the shoe - let them know

- Makeup or hair mishap - tell them

- never make a move on another girls man. 

- secrets are always kept secret

- fix each other up of someone's been upset in the restroom. We'll all collectively have products and tricks to make it appear like the crying never happened

- we must always give life advice in the restrooms too. It's just a law."
Not maintaining cuticles on your fingers fucks with how your nails grow and diva cups are wayyyy fucking better than pads or tampons. (In my opinion)
"In college, we would go up to our friends with guys and say ""Have you seen Mary?? (or any name)"" And if they say ""Yeah I just saw her in the bathroom"" or something along those lines, she's cool with the guy. But if she was like ""omg no, I'll help you find her"" it was a nonconfrontational way to get her out of the situation."

"My parents were well-off (they paid for my tuition) but they never paid for my car, insurance, cell phone, etc.  they expected me to take care of all that. I think the parents who gave their kids everything are setting them up for failure at the first sign of resistance in the real world."
"My SO does this and it annoys the shit out of me. For instance, I asked him to get makeup remover since he was at the store and sent a picture of the exact one so it should’ve been a quick errand. You’d have thought I asked him to cut off his own arm because he made such a huge deal out of having to walk into the ~girly section~ (and still didn’t even get the remover 🤬)."
"I once left an online group I really trusted and felt safe in in tears because I made a post saying I was relieved to have been approved for food stamps, because I could afford better food and with that going towards food, I could actually take myself to the movies once a month. 

All but one or two members of the group started accusing me of welfare fraud, being a cheat, misusing my finances, being the worst example of a poor person, on and on and on. All because I planned to have one nice thing that cost $12 a month."
Quality over quantity.
Adjusting a wedgie
"She grew up sharing a bathroom with her sister and they used the same toothpaste when they were younger. As the annoying younger sister, she always used the last bit of toothpaste and left an empty tube for her sister to replace. She never learned how to break the tamper-resistant seals that don’t have a tab to pull off.

For years, whenever she came across one of those foil and plastic seals, be it toothpaste or some prescribed medicine in a tube, she would struggle, attempting to peel off the seal using her nails or stabbing at it with whatever sharp object she could find. A few of years ago, her sister was visiting and saw her trying to open a new toothpaste with her nails because she was too lazy to walk to the kitchen for clean scissors. She took it from her, flipped the cap and pierced the foil and plastic in one go.

Her “oh shit” moment was realizing she was doing this whole younger sister thing wrong for years. She probably could have learned a lot more useful shit from her sister if she hadn’t been a lazy, annoying little sister."
"When people are stranded in the middle of nowhere or there is an apocalypse going on the men all grow beards because they can’t trim it, but somehow the women don’t grow armpit hair and leg hair and still have access to makeup.
Same thing in movies set in the Middle Ages or during war time."
"Instead of actually using an emoji, he types out the emoji. For example 🧐 = suspicious emoji, 👀 = eye emoji, 😍 = heart eyes emojis. 

There are only a handful of emojis he uses constantly but I find this super super funny and can’t help but to laugh whenever he does it !! He’s even starting to say the emoji out loud now.  Like when I say something he might respond with “hmmm suspicious emoji” while narrowing his eyes. It’s extremely funny. God, I love him so much."
"""Since you're good at your job you're just going to have to get used to people using you.

"as a guy, I feel like i'm harder and more excited/passionate if i don't masturbate, but at the same time, i don't last as long. So there's some give/take"
I hate that. I've seen guys panic/complain because there were 3 women in a room instead of 1 or 2. (Still out numbered but slightly less.)  Umm grow up?

"I used to work as a barista and my boss literally said to me, ""no wonder you get more tips, you've got the body for it"" and then looked at my boobs. I felt really gross the rest of the day. It made me super self-conscious about the t-shirts I wear."
"Oh man! This happened to me too a few years ago. I worked at a factory that had a point system. I usually left work at 3:30 but the second shift group leader came in at 2:50 and told my coworkers and I we’d be staying over two hours. I had to take my dog to the vet so I told him I wasn’t staying and asked if he could bring me a blue card. Which was basically just a piece of paper to fill out so it was documented you left. He signed it, I left at 3:30 and all was good. My supervisor pulls me into meeting the next day negotiating on firing me because I didn’t tell my first shift group leader that I wouldn’t be staying for over time. It ended with a pretty heated argument with my side being if the second shift group leader can tell me I have to stay, why can’t I tell him I’m leaving and expect him to relay the message if need be?"
"This one always cracks me up. The same person who just spent half an hour telling me, in detail,  the inner workings of a home network-is suddenly pretending they can’t understand a bit of paint-like color brushed or smeared on my face. (True story)

Of course I don’t expect everyone to know what everything is called, but the concept of applying mascara, or lipstick, is not hard to grasp. 

Dude, if your sexuality is so fragile it can be damaged by saying: “oh, it’s that stuff that goes on your eyelashes, neat.” Then ya got some soul searching to do..."
"Thank you!  
My girlfriend is so supportive of my expressing emotions/crying. She says, “It’s the 21st century, men are allowed to cry now.”   
Things that make me cry include, but are not limited to:
- Master Chef Jr. each time a tiny baby chef is sent home
- A stunning sunset or moonrise 
- Anything from Alaska (I miss it so much!)
- The end scene in the movie Black Klansman 
- Nearly all of America’s Got Talent  

I’m so happy that I can feel free to express myself openly without fear of ridicule."
"When I was politely asking my ex to stop harassing a group of girls to chat to his friends. Everyone was drunk but it was clear to me the boys had overstayed their welcome. 

I said ""hun, think these ladies are just trying to enjoy their night, let's go back to the table"" 

He turned to follow and shoved me so hard I fell forward into the table. Because I ""embarassed"" him. 

Back at our shared apartment he called me a lot of choice words. I locked myself in the spare room and he sat outside it screaming things at me and I remember just calling my friend to come get me. Amazing how quickly he could turn the charm back on as soon as another guy turned up. 

Unfortunately had to go back to pack up my apartment &amp; this guy tried to tell me again whilst I packed my room it was my fault because I was always jealous of him talking to women 🙄🙄"
"So many times since I started my divorce proceedings I have had this experience. 

Usually when viewing other peoples healthy relationships or telling stories about mine. 

The look of disbelief and, worse, pity, when I say something then realise actually, that wasn’t great. 

Sometimes it is amusing. Sometimes it is really sad. It is easy to accept a very unhealthy normal when it is your life. 

I know this isn’t quite the spirit of this lighthearted post but I suspect lots of people have the same realisation post split."

"In high school...

Brought a dozen eggs to school and then had my best friend help me nail him with them while he was smoking a cigarette behind the library.

I would never do anything like that as an adult, *ever*, but damn was it satisfying at the time. He deserved it! Heh heh."
"lol My boyfriend does this same sort of thing. One time I was driving us back late from one of the gigs his band was playing, and out of nowhere, I hear him mumble ""Please leave your order number in the comments."". Not super random since he works in customer service, but still... haha"
"Yes!! I remember way back in middle school, a girl got her period for the first time at school and bled onto her pants. Some boys started snickering before any girls noticed, but as soon as we did, four of us shepherded her first to her locker to get a sweatshirt to tie around her waist, and then to the bathroom with pads and tampons in hand."
"Wow, not owning a house when you’re just 27 is a norm where I live. Almost every person under 30 that I know just rents, some even still live with their parents and those who do own a house usually either got it bought by their parents or married young and took a mortgage together with their spouse. 


The most common reaction to that question would be probably just a blank stare."

"Job 1: After asking for help for 3 months, working 60-80 hour weeks. “I don’t care if you have to stay up all night to do your job. Get it done”

Job 2: women aren’t allowed on the company trip because there’s alcohol involved and we want to keep them safe. 

Also Job 2: A manager comes to my office yelling at me cause I looked at him wrong and questioned his response to something. I’m not letting someone talk to me that way, he wouldn’t leave when asked, so I raised my voice and responded to his comments. I’m the one who got in trouble for yelling at a man. They also made him my manager after that. 

I wasn’t there very long after these incidents."
"My doctor. She took the time to listen closely to my concerns over the past few months, and proposed a totally different approach in my treatment plan and it’s working. I’ve noticed such s difference with my depression symptoms as a result. I can’t tell you how glad I am to be able to feel calm and motivated at work, to feel social with others, to go for a run, to have an appetite again, and to read a paragraph in a book AND stay interested/focused. It’s awesome."

"Just fyi, you probably already know, but theres differences between blue and pink nappies that make them more appropriate for the gender they’re assigned. Boys nappies have more absorbency in the front where they wee and girls have more absorbency in the undercarriage part where they wee. So they’re actually not interchangeable.
 That being said kids should be able to wear whatever colours they like and genders shouldn’t have assigned colours, it makes no sense."
"Not shady but pretty empowering, and it really cut into him.

He cut me off from all of my friends, told me I couldn't go out unless he came too and only with girls he approved blah blah blah, controlling asshole basically. 

I was fed up and told him I didnt want HIM to go out the one night. He shoved me out of the way and went out after I calmly asked and explained why I didnt want him going out that night. I packed up all of my stuff, down to the last stray earring, and made sure it was like I never existed in our apartment, I even gave my armchair to the neighbor, because after hearing our arguments through the wall he also though it was justified. 

He came home around midnight, pretty tipsy with two friends who came over for one last drink. I had one duffel(the rest were in my car already) and i sat at the table with them and explained to him i was leaving for X Y Z reasons. I was able to defer almost any argument he gave and in the end he was on the edge of tears and apologized profusely. 

I then gave him a peice of paper and guided him through ripping it in half a few times. I told him to say sorry to the now peices of paper, and told him I am the paper, and that no apology could fix what he had done. The floodgates opened and at some point his friends left, I was too into the discussion to care. Sometimes I feel bad about it because I knew he felt he was in the right, and it probably crushed him to realize just how wrong he was."
"First day of big girl school. In the lunch line with my brand new friends. They were serving lasagna. I announced to the lunch lady ""I'd like the LA-SAG-NEE please"" and then repeated it over and over until she realised what I meant. My parents had been pronouncing it that way to teach me how to spell it."
It’s basically putting as little effort possible to keep someone as an option...like leaving little breadcrumbs.
"My girlfriend told me that some of her past boyfriends asked her to not where heels around them, even though she was still shorter than they were with them on! I couldn't believe it. I love when she wears heels because I'm able to look at her while we're standing next to each other without looking down nearly as much."

"Oh God. This reminded me of something that happened years ago. I was babysitting two kids--girl and a boy. The little girl wanted her nails painted,  so I painted them and then the little toddler boy wanted his nails painted too, so I obliged and painted his toe nails with all the colors his sister had.  And he was just delighted with his painted toes. Pranced around the house, showing the dog his painted toes.  Later, the mom told me that her husband saw the boy's painted toes and ""threw a fit"" that I tried to make his son ""girly"". Ugh."
Brag about how many girls have had sex with them or wanted to.

"Met my husband on okcupid . We matched like 89%. What I liked about that dating app was the whole questionnaire part to it. You can sorta tell who you could get along with by the way they answered the questions and you got more of an idea of who the person was vs the little blurbs in other sites. 
People that didn’t have any questions answered, in my experience, fell under 2 categories:
1. They were new to the app
2. They were just looking to fuck. 

But just a fair warning: 
Creeps, fuckboys, and “nice guys” are everywhere. All the dating apps are filled with them and even if you try to go out and mingle you will encounter them. Don’t let those assholes prevent you from trying to find someone to genuinely connect with!"
"What do you mean? If you saved that 10 bucks a week, you'd have enough for a down payment in only... 40 years. :P"
"It's not really a ""rule"" but we're both moody introverts and have a lot of little sayings to avoid the ""are you ok?"" ""i'm fine"" murky gray area that a lot of couples can fall into. 

""just a low baseline day"" or ""my brain is just being a shithead"" are perfectly legitimate responses to ""are you ok?"" so is ""uterus brain"" in my case as i have (suspected) PMDD that affects how i process things emotionally. we also both need a lot of alone time, and ""i just need some alone time"" has made former partners upset, but not him. 

also, if we ever do find ourselves in the ""are you ok?"" ""i'm fine"" trap we usually add a qualifier. so instead of ""are you ok?"" ""i'm fine"" ""are you sure?"" ""i said *i'm fine*"" it's more like ""are you ok? you seem a little distant"" ""i'm ok--just had a really tiresome client meeting today and haven't had a chance to recoup until now."" helps keep the lines of communication open"
"My ex got arrested for cocaine. We share a kid. I know it's not the same thing, but till that point I had been smoking weed every night to help with my insomnia without a medical card.

"I wish the system and HR wasn't set up like this in that people are terrified to tell the truth. I've experienced the same kind of situation as you - where my coworkers failed to back me up in fear of losing their jobs. It's a damn shame. Because of this, the shitbag I reported got in minor trouble, but recently got a promotion."
"Honestly, I left and am dating someone more sexually compatible. I couldn’t take the constant rejection. I felt really unattractive and creepy, and like I was being disgusting and spoiled for wanting my partner to touch me.

Maybe some people would be better able to deal with this kind of thing. I’m not one of them."
When people have minimum wage jobs but they live in an expensive city and their apartment/house is amazing and they have really nice clothes and they regularly go out for brunch but they never talk about how much credit card debt they are obviously in.
"This! I remembered showing my brother a funny video of these two friends canoeing in a lake, the guy ended up in the lake freaking out and crying/whining (I think he was just scared of the weeds touching him, not actually in danger) and I looked to my brother for his reaction and he got overwhelmingly upset. Saying he wants to punch the guy for being a pussy etc, he would never bitch like that etc."

"I grew up in an old house with inadequate heat and NO air conditioning in Florida!

Then I lived for a few years with my (then) boyfriend in an old house with no air conditioning and a wood stove for heat... Also in Florida.

When we got married and bought our own house it was a tiny little shit hole. Like, serious fixer upper with holes in the floor and crumbling kitchen cabinets and all of the carpet and wall paper was moldy. We fixed it up to a livable standard and bought window AC units for every room in the house and moved in. 

I was SOOO excited to have air conditioning and not be sticky and sweaty and miserable all summer! Sure, my house is small and even 14 years later we haven't completely finished fixing up the kitchen but it is cute and clean and warm in winter and cool in summer and even now, after all these years, I revel in it!"

"My mother's boyfriend. He has become seriously abusive to her and controlling of her. They've been together for 2 1/2 years and he has slowly isolated her from all friends and most of all of her family, including me and my siblings. He wakes her up in the middle of the night if she's laughed in her dreams convinced she is dreaming of another man. Questions her about her past constantly (they're both almost 50 and have been previously married) resents any friends she has. Were unable to spend quality time alone with her or even have private phone conversations when he is around. She wasnt even able to help plan my sister's wedding because he didn't want her going alone with us anywhere (dress/venue shopping etc.) She barely gets to leave the house alone bc he's convinced she will run in to an ""old flame"". He has been physically violent with his ex's and has pushed it with my mother. Not to mention his inappropriate aversion to very young women... So yeah, he's ""that guy"" for me. 
 She's recently realized how abusive this relationship is and has made plans to leave secretly. Wednesday we are moving her out while he's working and I've been a nervous wreck worried about her safety and her state of mind for a time now. I'm also stressed trying to put plans into action to get her out. Hopefully after this week she can put him behind her. I just hope he will leave ALL of us alone and not try anything crazy after she leaves. She questions herself everyday because she's been gaslighted everyday for a while now but she's staying strong and I have so much respect for her for recognizing what's happening and having the strength to get the fuck out."
"My female coworker and I were prepping before the lunch shift at a restaurant. Male GM walks over and says, ""You know, I had a dream about you two last night,"" pauses, reconsidering something, ""No, I probably shouldn't tell you about it,"" smiles to himself, and walks away. We were so appalled and disgusted we just stood there, too stunned to say anything."
I had a cancer scare and while I was waiting to hear back my boyfriend at the time cheated on me with his ex. And then he gaslighted me about it and she started bullying me and he just let it happen. Some men are just trash and best left in the past.
This is profound...
"This reminds me of the last time I had dinner with my SO's family. They needed to leave quickly but his mom had just ordered tea, and I pulled a thermos out of my pocket for her (work jacket has amazing pockets). It took me a second to realize that was an odd thing to just have in my pocket XD"
"Things like:

"I quit my job today. I'd been a PhD student with a flimsy contract which had no clause on termination (handily, it did have a clause on how I'm not entitled to even ask for raises on my scholarship). I decided to give a month's notice, because that's how much notice I would have if I was on a work contract, as per labor law, even though as a student, I can quit the following day. My boss got upset and started going on about how ""one month's notice was far too soon, that I can't just think I can walk out at the end of the month, well I can legally yes, but morally speaking it's extremely rude, he himself gives one year notices when he switches jobs, and, in his long career as PI he has never, ever had someone give ONLY a month's notice, not even technicians (emphasis his, technicians are on work contracts)"". I feel free af. Am starting new job in a month."
"I had a tall friend in highschool that learned the easiest way to tell if the relationship was going to go anyway was to wear heels on the first date. She was almost as tall as most of the guys our age and taller than some of them. When she had heels on she would be just a bit taller. She found that the jerks would get mad at her for wearing heels and tell her it was unlady like to want to be even taller than she already was. There were some that were much more cruel with how they stated it.

It is crazy how upset some of the guys would be with her for being taller than them."
"Not so serious - he does bins (trash), takes care of the garden, and is the bug exterminator. Oh and anything to do with the toilet. I mean, I can, I just don't wanna. I do everything else cos I have to have things 'just so'. 

Serious stuff - we never keep secrets (secrets are different to surprises). 

We respect each others history - by that I mean there are things that neither of us know in our pasts, but we know there's damage and we'll talk them all through eventually, but when that happens is down to us ourselves. 

Never go to bed angry. I don't care if we're up til 4am and I have to be up at 6 - we're dealing with this shit. 

Communicate always. If something is bothering one of us, we tell the other and leave each other alone if we're not in the right headspace to talk, and wait until we are ready. 

Everything is ours. Money - belongs to us both. Food - belongs to the household. There's no 'this is mine, and that's yours' bullshit. 

Phone. Free. Time. And I cannot stress enough how important this is. After about 9pm, phones go away. Only time they come out is if, for example, we want to show the other something or if he's in the kitchen making a snack then I'll scroll while he's busy and vice versa. But for the majority of the time - our phones are away to actually talk and be together. 

No means no until both of us say yes. This can be something as small as getting the kids' hair cut. Or something as big as having another baby. 

Time apart! Omg. We both feel it's important we each have down time on our own. I tend to have a bath and he lays on his XBox or watches YouTube or whatever. And understanding that we do need space occasionally. So if I've had a bad day and want to disappear in my head for a while, he'll get me my headphones and leave me alone for a bit. Time apart doesn't mean that we have to not be in the same place. Just respecting each other as individuals"

"Our love story started where all great love stories do: an AA meeting. 

I had been living in a women’s residential treatment center for about nine months when I tagged along with a friend/fellow resident to a meeting I hadn’t been to in years. Afterwards she introduced me to her friend of 20+ some years (I was 24 at the time, they were both 34) and physically he was my type but everything else was way different from my dating history. I was actually riding out the last legs of a situationship with a friend turned fuck buddy and was “swearing off men forever!” so I couldn’t have been less interested the night we met and he was more interested in bumming smokes as both us women had jobs, therefore money, therefore cigs, whereas he did not. 

To make a long story short, we bumped into each other about a week later and have been inseparable ever since. I do think our age difference has a bit to do with it - my history of guys in my age range includes a lot of narcissism and mommy issues, tbh. My boyfriend is mature in a very relaxed way. He never made/makes me feel like how I feel is wrong, he that he knows better than I do, or that I am anything less than the most valuable person on Earth. He’s always willing to grow spiritually and emotionally and he’s always willing to be better than he was yesterday. He’s the most wonderful man I know. 

We’ve been together since August 2017 and our daughter will be six months old on Friday. And despite what our peers warned us about, neither of us relapsed in sobriety getting into the relationship so soon. Watching him turn into the man he is today has been such a privilege. I really am so lucky."
