"People can't seem to understand that other people have diabetes, asthma, etc. I see so many stories about people yelling at people who take insulin shots in public or people who yell at people who have asthma attacks. So inconsiderate."
"I ordered the vegetarian meal and it had no meat! 0/10

I ordered my meal to go and they gave me a takeaway container! 0/10

I asked the seamstress to hem my pants by 4 inches and now they're shorter! 0/10"
People get crazy as fuck about their ice cream. When blue bell came back to Texas people were camping out before the trucks arrived.
"OP holds out hand, palm up


‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a full refund‚Äù"
So she can't go 3 days without a phone but she doesn't use it enough to remember the password ü§î
"You can‚Äôt breathe- how rude 


Lady sounds like a crazy person lol"
it would‚Äôve been funny if you pretended to ‚Äúexchange‚Äù and swapped the boxes 
"I had someone with that exact same scenario. But they also used false security question answers too. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anyone to know the real answers!‚Äù

"I now work at a store where we have automatic sliding doors that lock really quickly and easily with a key, but when I trained for my current job I was at a store in an indoor mall which was open to the centre during the day and had a key-operated roller security grate that was closed overnight. Every single night we locked up someone would duck under the grate as it lowered and ask ""oh, are you closed?"" and then Indiana Jones their way back out under the still-closing door. I had to hit the emergency stop so many times to prevent someone getting squashed. "
"This is hilarious, I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine what goes through these peoples minds. Ah the glory of retail. "
"If you remember the officer's name, you could probably call your local PD non emergency and ask for follow up."
"""Blue Bell...Same Great Taste Now Listeria Free!"" would have been a great slogan for their comeback. I missed Blue Bell too, but but camping out and waiting for it is ridiculous. "
"&gt;""BE NICE TO PEOPLE, YOU SELF RIGHTEOUS BITCH!""

""You first! :)"" "
At least your boss didn't cave.  That's what's really infuriating. 
"Don‚Äôt worry, it won‚Äôt run out of battery because she‚Äôll never realize that it needs to be turned on and set up. "
I can't believe a 40 year old guy goes down to Verizon once a month to pay his cellphone bill. 
"Sorry to say, they do. One of the stories I saw, this happened: The person took an insulin shot in their car and a woman knocked on the window and yelled ""You could be making better choices!"" A few other stories I remember there were people who did it in public and another customer would ask the manager to kick the people out since it was ""inappropriate"" to do it in public. I have not seen it in public personally but people are crazy enough to complain about it, I have no doubt that they would."
"Question:""What's your pet's name?""

Answer:""THAT'S NON OF YOUR FUCKIN' BUSINESS!"" *Banshee screech*"
Yelling at people for insulin shots? People don't actually do that... right?
Gotta grab whatever sells fast. 
Sounds like the doughnut worked exactly as intended. 
"...that's just rude. I hope there's some way to get the effects of that survey redacted, because seriously?"
"This is doubly bad because it's from someone who works in the company and should know how things work. I mean, it would be nasty any way you cut it, but that just makes it worse."
"Customers denied their product can be effin ridiculous :( at my old drive thru, the drinks machine broke down. Anyway, we were struggling through and opening the big bottles, but didn't have diet Pepsi. A customer threatened me, personally, with legal action because, as he was a diabetic, I was denying him his human rights by not providing a diet beverage....that was a fun encounter *sigh*"
"*drops dead*

""now that's just bad service"" "
I had this a few times. I started telling people it was return fraud to get back money you didn‚Äôt actually give. They kind of started to get it. 
"I refuse to become this ridiculous when I get old. I swear it's like these people are a breed that all conjugate together and hold ""how to be a horrible customer"" meetings annually. "
"I would have swapped the 3rd ""can I help you?"" with ""Please make your final selections and make your way to the register.  The sales register will close in 5 minutes and no purchases can be made after that point.""

Professional, but brooks no argument."
"That‚Äôs what I thought would happen! ‚ÄúWell you can‚Äôt return it, but we can exchange it for the same item.‚Äù Then hand him the empty box. "
"They should NOT have let her buy shoes. Instead they should have called the police and reported a criminal trespass, and possibly added that they felt threatened(cops love hearing that. )    "
Give him some water and tell him to go cry about his violated human rights to someone who gives a damn.
"""If I can get inside the store they have to serve me"""
Had a customer do this to me when I was a cashier. I was 18 and my dog had been put to sleep that morning. One of my friends stopped by and asked me about the dog because he knew she had been sick. I was on register ringing a lady up and I just started bawling. The lady came around and gave me a big hug. When the people in line behind her started to kick up a fuss she told them off. It was very sweet of her. 
"My boss is the bomb, she got nerves of adamantiumüòÇ"
"I'm just amazed that this lady was clearly super impatient, but pays with the most time consuming method available. Like, are you in a rush, or do you have the time to write out a check and get it processed? And if you choose to take the most time consuming method, it's nobody's fault but your own when it takes a while."
Cold medicine is used to make crystal meth
"I hate when people do that. We had this one woman that never remembered her damned card until after. She was always wanting to do refunds on full baskets of stuff because she forgot her card at home, etc. Got to the point where I'd ask if she had her card before ringing her up and if she didn't, I'd tell her to go get it and we'd hold the basket or she was going to have to pay full price and NO refund later. She finally started to remember but damned if that wasn't frustrating."
"I hated, absolutely hated those surveys. I suppose they wouldn't be so bad if corporate completely failed to realize that customers, like the corporate execs, are lying morons. "
r/gatekeeping
"We've made it a habit to lock the doors as soon as we ""shut down"". We don't empty tills or turn off lights with an unlocked door or a customer inside.

We had to do it that way, because people will come into a dark store 2 hours after you close, ask when you close, and when you reply ""we closed 2 hours ago"" they just ignore you and keep browsing."
"At my shop we have to lock the doors entirely before we count down the cash.

That doesn't stop at least one family per night frantically jiggling the handle and banging on the door. They wave their arms through the window yelling ""ARE YOU OPEN??!?"".

This other night I closed the drawer, dropped my cash, locked up the safe, turned off allllll the lights. I took my key out of the door, lights off- so that I could beat a hasty retreat because the key likes to stick. Alarm box. In the back says ""Ready to Arm"". I enter the arm code and ""Disarmed NOT ready to ARM!"" Comes over the intercom. That means my front door was fucked with. I go out into a completely dark store and there is a woman and her two kids huddled IN THE DOORWAY. Inside. Asking if we are still open. I said ""Ma'am clearly not! I must ask for your safety to please EXIT THE BUILDING. NOW.""

She honestly thought if she could catch me I would have to re open for her. "
"Surveys can only be appealed if a customer explicitly states that the advisor was great, or their score was a mistake. I.e. ""Tryantula was excellent in store but I xx from xx store was awful"". Or ""my zero was meant to be a 10"""
"Hmm.. In the store I worked at, the ""free"" product was still paid for but at a discount, and the rest of the price was discounted off the first item. 

So like someone bought a bag for $25, got a free accessory worth $10. The discount would take $7.50 off the accessory and $2.50 off the bag.

Although that never stopped people from demanding a refund for the full price.."
