It is reasonable to not want someone to smoke weed in your bedroom.
Yeah but not by rain 
"*""He said that when I cook broccoli in the kitchen and it smells, it’s the same thing as him smoking weed in my room.""*

Except he doesn't sleep in the kitchen."
"1) Dating in NYC (and everywhere) is a time investment. 

If you’re unwilling or unable to put in time on weekdays, and rule out weekends because you’re too tired, you’re not going to meet anyone significant, period. Unless you’re in a job which expects you to work until 11 pm or later on a regular basis like consulting or investment banking, in which case you have a valid excuse for not having time on weekdays. Even then, I have a hard time believing you can’t find  at least one night a week to meet up with someone for a drink, a paint night, dinner, or whatever tickles your fancy. 

2) Dating in NYC (and everywhere) requires a string of failures before any sort of success. 

You have to learn to state your values clearly, i.e. “I’m looking to find someone I can have a serious relationship with”, and be OK with rejecting someone or being rejected based on a mismatch in values. Also, my experience dating here in NYC in my 20s has been that many serious relationships have begun with a period of informal hooking up. Don’t be put off if a guy isn’t ready to commit to you within 2-3 dates of meeting, it’s human nature to “test the waters” of being with someone before committing. Most of the time, it’s not even about maintaining the freedom to hook up with other women - it’s about scoping you out to make sure you don’t have any jealous exes or unresolved feelings from other relationships that are going to come haunt your new potential relationship. 

Source: I’m a guy. 

If online dating isn’t doing it for you, there’s 100s of other threads in this sub where people suggest joining Meetups, sports leagues, speed dating events, classes, volunteering organizations, etc."
"On the list of things that could kill me, bombs are way down near the bottom. 

Besides, rent’s due in a week.  "
"Everyone is saying not to call because you might get them in trouble if it isn’t really domestic violence.

I completely disagree. I believe that if you suspect someone is being abused, you have an obligation to call the cops. Be confident before you call. Record the noise **from your own home** and play it back to see if it still sounds like what you suspect. And if so, make the call.

It would be horrible if they were an innocent couple who weren’t lawful citizens and ended up deported. 

It would be worse if you simply ignored domestic abuse. 

People possibly being physically harmed/beaten outranks people being possibly deported in terms of severity.

I can’t stand people who encourage by-standing "
"She can keep calling the police and just make them do their fucking job, even if they think it's ""wasting their time"".

Otherwise probably not a lot of options."
"these film shoots routinely disrupt the normal daily lives of a lot of NYers, myself included.  Get off your high horse and realize we all live/work in this city together."
"911 for the trespassing homeless guy.

You are in no way obligated to let him remain there.

311 for the broken door lock.

Is your apartment stabilized?

Be aware that, I know you are in the right, if you are not stabilized the landlord can refuse to renew your lease. However, I would seek out a more secure living situation."
He needs to stop looking and call his embassy now.
"I’m no lawyer, but I’m pretty sure you can call 911 to report a trespasser in your building. You can also throw in that you don’t feel approaching him. "

Your own damn neighborhood
"I’m not prone to pearl clutching, but a homeless dude camping out and refusing to fix the front door lock are two things that would keep me from resigning a lease."
"If you don’t have time to go out on dates, maybe it’s not the right time for you to be looking for a meaningful relationship? If you’re too busy, you will have a hard time making or maintaining any of those connections. 

In terms of meeting people romantically, this city has a million ways to do that. You just have to have the time and motivation to take advantage of them and go through multiple (sometimes many multiples) of failures. "
"I'm going to disagree with this. If they're using our streets and public areas, it's entirely our prerogative to observe. It's not as if we're invading their offices; rather, we're letting them use our public spaces.

And I think it's to their benefit as well to be tolerant of spectators, in terms of community relations -- personally, I'm much more willing to put up with the inconvenience of having my neighborhood constantly taken over by film crews in exchange for the experience of getting to see, even if just briefly, a behind-the-scenes view of how movies and TV shows are made."
"&gt;I don’t have it in my heart to take my landlord to court and get a bunch of money out of her.

You mean your landlord who owns a building in NYC? That's the person that you feel bad about reporting that they're not providing you with a safe environment &amp; allows randos in your building?

You have a choice here. You've had multiple government staff tell you to report the landlord. You have mulitple people on this thread telling you how to handle the situation. If you want to continue to live in a place that has flimsy doors &amp; allows people who don't live there in the hallways because you can't ""tell"" on your landlord, then you need to learn to suck it up."
You're crazy for trying to squeeze in Niagara. 
"You are being completely reasonable. Not everyone loves the smell of weed. Especially when they’re trying to sleep. 

Tell the kid to grow up and get a vape. Most delivery services I know sell the oil cartridges. They don’t really create a lasting smell and you don’t have to smoke out a window. "
"Wtf oh hell nah dude call 911 fuck that


I grew up on a walk up building in Harlem my building had security doors and cameras on the hallway.  


Your landlord has do make your building secured so called 311 on him too "
"Yes, but the NYPD kinda has a “Book em all and let the judge sort em out” policy on knives that’s pretty dependent on what shade your skin is."
"Doesn’t a legal bedroom need to have an accessible window?

He could just buy a vape pen and all your problems are solved."
"Is there a mechanical key override?

What would happen in a blackout?

Has this affected other tenants?

Is this a large building or complex with an office?

Have you sent the landlord an email reporting this and saved the communication?"
"That is definitely illegal, call the city on your landlord.."
You are missing the fact that you have not examined the apartment in person. Just because you see something online does not mean it is real.
"I would say $15 at an absolute MINIMUM. I would never take anything lower than that, even for a short gig. $18+ usually for one child, $20+ for two or more.

Edit to add: This is the hourly rate. "
"Does this dude not know how to make a sploof? Stuff some dryer sheets into a cardboard tube (paper towel or toilet paper roll) and voila, no smell. Dude can smoke in his own room to his heart's content."
I second this. If you're too exhausted to go out on the weekends because of work you should make sure your health isn't a problem and if it isn't then you should probably reassess living in NYC. 
I'm on a month to month lease now since my one year lease ended. The landlord wants to get rid of us because she got a $1500 fine when the fire department had to come bust me out of my apartment because I got locked in due to our oversized door / small frame.  
"You are going to get glared at fiercely if you bring a one year old to a nice romantic restaurant. 

Death glare.

You need to put that off until your toddler tolerates a sitter."
"You will not stand out anywhere. Especially in the village.  It's Halloween. 

Try - The Monster, Stonewall, or Duplex. "
"It takes about a year here to build a social network. You have to find things to be regulars at - a bar, a volunteer organization, a concert series, a coffee shop - whatever. Something near your home or your work. You show up all the time. Constantly be around. Casually get to know other regulars and expand from there. Building a network here takes time and effort. That you have no friends after a month is not surprising or abnormal. "
"&gt;more authentic ways for me to experience NYC?

Yea come on my commute with me and sit in my office for 9 hours. You're a real new yorker now."

Expensive
"I've lived in NYC for 40 years.  I have never even heard of a true Tex-Mex place.  There is amazing Mexican food here, but I feel true Tex-Mex is a regional thing.  It's like asking I'm from New York and just moved to Texas, I'm looking for a New York style slice and bagel. "
"i'm not sure if cops drag their heels in showing up when it's a domestic violence call, but you could just say you hear people fighting and crashing noises"
I’ll pay you to clean your ears. HMU. 
"Personally I do not know but that seems ""wrong"" that if their is a blackout or the system malfunctions you SOL.

My only experience with fobs is where I volunteer and there is a manual key which tenured people in leadership positions are issued. When I did have a gar, the garage in my building had a fob but people passed around info that if you trip a certain circuit breaker it opens the door and there is a chain lift if the power goes out.

It would make sense that each apartment have ONE manual key but very little in NYC makes sense."
"Living in UWS in your 20s....... will be AMAZING. UWS can be that perfect combo of quiet, yet has the density of amazing restaurants, bars, comedy clubs, etc. "

"Karczma and Krolewskie Jadlo, both are in Greenpoint. 

Never been to Dziupla in Williamsburg but I've heard good things. Owned by the same people as Krolewskie Jadlo."
Straight up g.

"&gt;It is reasonable to not want someone to smoke weed in your bedroom.

I'm not sure why but this made me actually ""Lol"""
"Yep, this. The odds that I will be in the same place of one of those are much, much lower than the odds of, say, a mugging or bedbugs. If I worked for a news organization or public figure, I might be a little uneasy, but even then, most New Yorkers have the ""Worry is the interest you pay on a debt you may not owe"" mentality after a while."
The parade.
Absolutely not.
"Legally a bedroom must  

* Have a minimum of 80 square feet and no dimension measuring less than 8 feet. If the apartment contains three or more bedrooms, half of the bedrooms may have a minimum dimension of 7 feet.

* Have a minimum ceiling height of 8 feet. If the bedroom is in a basement, it must have a ceiling height of at least 7 feet. If there’s a sloped ceiling over all or part of the room, there must be a clear ceiling height of at least 7 feet over at least two-thirds of the room.
* Have at least one window that opens to a street, yard, garden or court on the same lot. In some zoning districts, skylights may be substituted for windows.
* Have two means of egress; whether egress is via window or a door, it must be operable from the inside without the use of keys, tools or special skills.
* Cannot serve as a passage to another room."
"Exactly.  If a film crew is taking over my neighborhood, but chill and respectful of me and my home, then I'm cool with it.  But if a film crew moves in and starts throwing orders around like their gods gift to NYC, please fuck off.  "
"imo it depends more on your personalty than your age and what you want to get out of your neighborhood. Its definitely slower and quieter than LES or parts of brooklyn but there’s still plenty of good bars and restaurants from broadway to columbus, plus central park and riverside close by. I love it up here but you should come up and walk around on a weekend just to get the feel for it. "
I'm guessing *upper west side*. Although I thought UWS to be the abbreviation used.
"Jesus, I haven't heard the word 'sploof' since maybe 2005 when I was still in college. What a trip."
"Have you tried El Original in Hell’s Kitchen? It’s owned by a couple of Tex-pats from Austin, and it’s pretty good. Queso is a rarity in this town, and theirs tastes like Kerbey Lane or Cafe Brazil. "
Actually it's apparently pretty common for people to hire prostitutes just to cuddle or talk to so this is a very solid suggestion

Just live your life. None of them were addressed to any of us here.
This is the most pretentious tourist post ever. Shit is never that deep dude.
"I think you're trying to do too much. Not only do I think what you're doing is super rushed or perhaps not possible in spots (you really want to go from the High Line to the Botanical Garden in the same afternoon? You want to return all the way from Niagara Falls and then do the Statue of Liberty AND THEN DO THE PHILHARMONIC??). 

I'm exhausted reading that. Cut out a couple things each day - have some spontaneity in the trip"
