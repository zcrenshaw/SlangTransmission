"I think she was thinking you HAVE it, but you aren’t SELLING it - like it’s in your stockroom or something but you’re refusing to sell it to her. Same languages, but different. lol"
Yeah this was before my c-section. I definitely left my most of my modesty in that surgical suite.

My BF still tells the story of how his mom (in the 1970s) was contacted by Disney because she was selling buttons made from Disney gift wrap that she had purchased.

Nope still got the stumps nothing grown back.
"you do know that they get completely naked when youre NOT there, right? them wearing jocks was BECAUSE you were there."
"Clearly, you broke his phone on purpose with your witchcraft, hoping for an emergency, so you could stand over him cackling while he couldn't call for help. "
"I do, in fact, want more from OP’s work history"
I was so hoping this was going to be about a drunk astrological reading
"Well that's the point of the quotations. It's not really being progressive. It's just someone saying ""Don't worry, I know what's right for you."""
"I told one of my female coworkers that my husband and I had to stop going to a restaurant because the owner flashed her breasts at him (making him extremely uncomfortable). My coworker's reply was ""That should make you wanna go there more"". I had to ask her if she likes going to businesses and being flashed. "
"So true! I cannot tell you how many male patients tell me “it’s fine” when I put a sheet over them before I have them lower their pants for an x-ray. No, it’s not fine. I don’t want to see your underwear or lack thereof!"
Oh.. Oh no... 
I want to see the r/TalesfromtheCustomer that corresponds with this story. That would be super fun to hear what was happening in her head!

"I actually almost exactly this yesterday, haha."
But it was 4:59. Not 5:00
"I’m really lucky I don’t get panic attacks. This gave me a stress headache and I get anxiety when people are super crabby or bitchy. I just want to get them through checkout as quickly as possible so they’ll leave sooner. Since I’m normally behind the counter I don’t get touched much, but stories from this sub and r/IDontWorkHereLady make me nervous to be physically near crabby/bitchy people, especially after yesterday. Getting yelled at (or whatever you’d call her outburst) is almost like the emotional equivalent of getting grabbed for me though. That’s why I walked away to the sign. Just get away from her for a second."
"I like Latin, so I’m gonna try “noli perturbare” (do not disturb) or whatever would be “do not touch” which I’ll have to look up. Noli tangere I think."

"It’s good because it tastes exactly like Sprite, imo. I have a pretty sensitive stomach, so I’ll have a Sprite to settle it usually, but I also get migraines if I don’t drink enough caffeine. I was pretty excited when Ice came out because it’s basically a cure-all. "
There's one customer who's always just been a bit meh with me. Not like he really hides it but I think it's because I told him daughter not to jump on something incase she broke it or hurt herself. 
She got her satisfaction from stomping out like a petulant toddler.
I'd say she's plum loco
"I wondered this too before I had babies. It’s sooo useful for reasons others already described, but I also wanted to add that sometimes it’s also less rude and more considerate of others to take the carrier into a store, as opposed to a stroller.  OP described their store as having lots of merch and narrow aisles that fit one customer. I would use the carrier for that, or in an out trips, like a drugstore all the time. The carrier snaps in and out of the car, without distrusting the baby much. 

I lived in the Vegas desert for too long and I would probably rather see people carry a baby in a shopping bag, than leave them in the car. "

"how can an adult function, and most likely have a job, and be so clueless?"
Plenty of people go nuts over pro teams despite never having been employed by or in any way affiliated with the organization.
"I worked for one of the big office supply retailers, and one of our district managers did something similar - with paper towel. Every store in the district got an few extra pallets of paper towels distributed to them to balance his mistake. We all had paper towel for so long... because who goes to office supply stores to buy paper towel (the kitchen kind, not the break room kind). Ugh. It was awful. "

"See, if im checking my system for something for a customer and i have doubts about finding the product, usually when it says we have just 1 in stock(could be on overflow, could have been stolen so it didnt register as being sold, could have been set down by a customer on a shelf it doesnt belong, could have sold and just didnt update, etc etc) I never say ""well computer says we have one in stock let me get it"" to prevent people from demanding I produce something that might not even exist. I always word it with caution ""Well, my computer is telling me we may or may not have it, ill check around for it and if i dont find it it musta sold""

Ill go to the end of the earth to look for something as all I want is for people to get what they want and go home happy, but I refuse to run around like a chicken with my head cut off over something that might not physically exist and somebody unable to understand QTY 1 is not as definitive as QTY 6 or 12 which are full cases"
"Ah yes, remember the Nike ad? People burned shoes they bought over it lol. And Nike made a nifty profit too!"

"""So I was shopping in this store, minding my own business and being extremely polite, and I saw a sign on a table with only apples that said $0.89, with no other words on the sign. I wanted to verify this price so I politely asked a nearby associate (who already seemed to have a bad attitude) if this was correct. The associate scoffed in my face and said 'Are you stupid? That sign is obviously for the oranges across the store.' 

Now, these oranges were at least 20 feet away. I, of course, thought the associate was mistaken and most likely misheard me and said 'Excuse me, I don't mean to be rude, but the sign is on this table for these apples.' They just laughed in my face and ignored me. 

I then left to find my friend because she desperately needed apples to bake an apple pie for her dying mother (her mother's favorite dessert), and when I got back, they had CHANGED the sign and when I asked, they accused me of LYING to them about the sign and said if I don't like the price, don't buy them!

Unbelievably rude customer service, will never shop there again!""

"""oh now look, you gave someone 5 seconds of sweeping and you got...nothing? you sure showed us!"""
"That's what I thought. Eventually, these people will catch on."
