Well the top post of all time just tells me that Stan Lee died. Probably the stupidest “question” I’ve ever seen on Ask Reddit 
Number 3: When will Stan Lee die
Stan Lee
"I hate the people who constantly talk like ""omg yas we stan a queen, spill the hot tea sis, i am living"""
"Not this shit again. We already killed Stan, isn't that enough for you sick fucks?"
