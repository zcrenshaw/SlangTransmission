"Dude, this is my life! My wife is not a native English speaker. She does well, holds a job, writes very well. But every day there is something, many things, that we have to go over and over and finally one of us says ""ohhhh"".

Sometimes, most of the time, it's funny as hell. She makes me laugh every day.  

Example that a month or two after she moved here. I was driving, she was in the passenger seat. She was suddenly playing with the window control, trying to figure out how to lower the window. (She didn't have a car in her country and was unfamiliar how to operate one.)

""What is it called?""

""What is what called baby?""

""When you have air...what is that called?""

What do you mean when you have air?""

You know, when you have too much air?""

""Too much air?""

""Yes, baby. I've heard you do it. You know, when air comes out of your bottom?""

""Fart? You mean fart?""

""Yes FART! That's the word! Could you show me how to open this window? I have to fart!""

I love her so much. She has made my life such a joy.

As far as language barrier, just go with it. She will not get frustrated with YOU. She may get frustrated with not being able to express herself. But she will improve significantly as time goes on. It will get better and it is awesome being part of someone's adventure in a new life. And dude, if she invites you to her house for dinner, the food is AWESOME!

go for it. Don't worry. It will work out."
Sounds like your wife would like to try sex on the porch.
"You sound genuinely conflicted here. I get that regardless of how unreasonable you see your fading attraction is, you can't help it. Someone said her confidence dropping is not helping things either. Make sure you are building her up. Do not tell her this. I'm warning you. It will ruin your relationship. 

Someone also said about watching mature porn. I know sleek non stretch mark riddled bodies are hot, but so are mature bodies. Motherly bodies. I am your wife. I left the father of my child and met another recently. I only just recently let him see my belly during sex and he said this..

""I'm a grown ass man. You're a grown ass woman who carried a child. I know what I want and these stretch marks make you more beautiful.""

My boost of confidence has been astounding since. I also have a skin hanging problem. I wear a tank top a lot during sex and pull mu breasts over it. Lingerie and experimenting will be amazing for you.

Dude. I know. It's a huge transition. It was for me as well being your wife in the story. Please don't say anything. It'll crush her in ways I can never explain. My ex did that and it immediately killed anything we had together. Just do some of our advice and try it out. Remember, you're not with a young woman anymore. You're with a mother."
"You're not obligated to provide housing to an adult because she became pregnant. Help her out how? She already has a place to live with a grand parent who will probably be thrilled to spend time with his new grandchild.

The house is yours, the decision is yours. You don't want your home taken over by a child. You may want to get a pet and not consider a child...you're not ready for parenthood.

Be prepared for fall out, though. Your cousin's choice is not your responsibility as far as your family is concerned."
"First you have to change your focus a little. Study her face, her neck, the curve of her hips, her butt, her legs, her eyes, her hair. All of the physical attributes that she has. Take a step back and look her as a woman not as your wife. She’s not just attractive and sexually appealing because of her stomach. Check her out like other men do - and they do.

If you watch porn start looking at a mature and amateur stuff - regular women of all shapes and sizes being enjoyed and enjoying themselves. You will find some sexy stuff to think about and see your lady in a little different light.

Lingerie is available in all shapes and types for women of all shapes- take a look with her and find something suitable and appealing.

Help her feel desirable, appealing and wanted.
Be attentive and flirt with her, caresses and bum pats, let her know you desire her. 

If she feels sexy she will be sexy and you will appreciate and enjoy it together."
Maybe Step One of curing your depression would be getting rid of the unsupportive alcoholic in your life.
"I want to apologize ahead of time for the fact that this will likely be long. 

I was married for over a decade to a man who had unattainable standards for how he thought a woman should look. I constantly felt ashamed of my body.  I gave birth to two children, breastfed them, and my belly, hips, and breasts will never be the same. I felt as though I didn't deserve to be loved our cherished, and that nobody could ever find me attractive. 

I got divorced fairly recently, and have had one partner since. Sometimes, due to old habits, when I got undressed with them, I felt embarrassed and ashamed to be seen. At one point, they were lying with their head pillowed on my thighs, gently stroking my stretch-marked belly, feeling the difference in texture from the rest of my skin. I felt a wave of embarrassment, and tried to cover my belly with my hands, but they gently pushed my hands away, kissed my belly, and said earnestly, ""Please don't hide. It's beautiful. You're beautiful. You shouldn't ever feel ashamed of your body."" 

Even just writing about it has me in  tears; that was the most healing experience of my life. 

Your wife's body is different. It's going to *stay* different. What you need to do is work through the disappoinment you feel that her body isn't the same as before, and learn to appreciate and embrace how she looks now.  Her belly is softer than before, but it's a beautiful place to lay your head. Her skin may bear stretch marks, but that's because she bore your children. They're a sign of the intimacy and love you two of you have, the beauty of your connection and the lives you have created.  

Rather than spending time feeling disappointed in the changes in her body, try to change up your focus on her. Think of the relationship the two of you have, the beauty of her smile, the curve of her neck, the feeling of gripping her hips. Touch her. Touch her a lot. It will help you grow accustomed to her new body, and it will help her feel more comfortable and secure, knowing you don't shy away from her because of the changes."
It's time to stop caring if they think you're nice tell the landlord. You live there too. I am a dog lover and this sounds unbearable.
"You seem very passive in all of this which is strange to me. I have no doubt that you love your children very much, but structure and boundaries are an important part of how children feel cared for and supported. Having no structure is not much better than being draconian. I also think it is very strange that as the relationship between your wife and child has deteriorated, you have done NOTHING. If your daughter is rude to your wife, it's reasonable to talk to her about it and ask her to apologize. Just because it's normal developmentally for a 13 year old to be sassy occasional doesn't mean that you never try to guide their behavior. 

And even more importantly, if your wife ever takes out her rage on your daughter (like when she flung the picture on the floor and stomped on it, that kind of outburst), you HAVE to step in and protect your child from her. She sounds kind of unhinged to be honest, like some kind of jealous, bitter wicked stepmother. 

Anyway obviously your child is your top priority. If your wife can't be a good stepmother to her, then your wife has to go."
You mention the kids are 7 and 12.  Id give you the same advice parents need when their 18 year olds date a man who's really bad for them.... Play nice and be involved.  When shit hits the fan you'll be there to help.  In this case it's help the kids.  Be there for them even if it means you grin and bear it in regards to your brother. 
"i just wanted to say this post totally made my day. you sound like a wonderful grandparent!

&amp;#x200B;

the fact that she opens up to you about boys and school and her life means a lot. you're definitely doing something right, so i would just keep doing what you're doing :)"
"Congrats on your 31 year old son.

But honestly, you giving him way too much support. He's 31 and not working towards any sort of higher position. This relationship dynamic will stay the same unless you either cut him off or just get out of it."
"Also keep in mind her huge sacrifice. She's given up her awesome bid, a previous point of pride, to grow your family. That is strong, that is fearless, that is beautiful!"
"&gt;She talks to me about memes I can't really say I understand most times, about school and some boy she's having some low key teenage drama with, soccer, mobile games.   
&gt;  
&gt;I ""threw it right back at her"" a few days ago and she laughed a lot. Also I have started saying yeet at unexpected moments just get her to laugh and it's generally been working.

She already feels bonded to you, she feels comfortable talking to you about her life. 

You want to be closer to her, but she already feels close to you. So why don't you feel close enough?

Answer: you haven't been sharing YOU with her. Start telling her little bits and pieces of your life - either your daily life, or your past, or whatever you like talking about. Start small, keep it short, see how she reacts. I bet you will be pleasantly surprised that she wants to hear more about who you are and what you do."
"You kinda glossed over the fact that your brother-in-law is a *pediatric nurse* and your wife is still not allowing your children to be left around him. 

It's normal to have high standards for who watches your kid, but this is definitely overboard. It does sound like your wife has an unhealthy thought pattern in her head about this."
"Please don’t disregard your own sex drive and relationship with your body for the sake of someone else’s sexual gratification. If you’re not feeling it, you’re not feeling it and forcing yourself to go through the motions when you don’t want to is going to leave you with a really unhealthy unhappy relationship with sex and your own body. I think you need to explain how you feel to him, if he’s worth your time he’ll understand. "
"Unfortunately we all notice attractive people, but it’s all in how you react to it. It sounds like he’s more aware of it and if he can be more aware that a few moments of checking someone out is not worth the insecurity you will feel, then I think you’ll be all right!  

I really like how receptive he was to this though. This is a good sign for future communication! My husband and I have been together eight years and have had to have some uncomfortable conversations but it’s all in how you approach it and how you react to their response."
"That's rough buddy, but good for you for expressing your boundaries. She seems like a really solid friend for respecting your decision and not pressing the issue further. Loneliness is awful and it does weird things to people, and I think it gets hard when people tell you you're supposed to be in your prime (late teens/early 20s) for dating, and you personally are not in your prime.

That being said though, I think just being there for her the way you are is the only thing you can do. Is there a way you could introduce her to some of your friends at her own home maybe? Or invite some of her friends over to watch a movie?

Also as is usually recommended on this subreddit, encouraging her to seek professional help for her mental illness is always a good thing to do. Other than that, I would keep this interaction to yourself so as not to embarrass her. I think she was in a really bad place, and if this stays as your secret that would probably be for the best."
"I don't think you'd be overstepping to bring this up to him, but be prepared for him to shut you out.

I think your brother is kicking that grief can down the road.

He should not be starting a relationship right now, but we aren't in his shoes. He very will may have grieved while she was sick. He also has children he needs to focus on. I'm sure this woman very much fills this role for him, conveniently looks like his dead wife, and can take burden off him.

No one ever grieves how *they* expect, let alone fulfilling the expectations of those around them as the surviving spouse."
"""Your mother will not stop teaching sexist beliefs to our daughter. She is going as far as to talk to our three year old about sex. I no longer want my child growing up around such inappropriate and wrong beliefs. From this point on, your mother will not be allowed to see our daughter unless you (if you trust him to shut his mom up and kick her out if need be) or I are there, too. We can talk to her privately first and let her know what topics are not allowed around our daughter. If she slips up, she may have one warning before being kicked out."" 

Maybe a safe word can be helpful as well, if your husband doesnt understand some things his mom says. "
You won’t regret learning some Italian and she will be thrilled you are making the effort. Crack open the Duolingo and learn each other’s languages!
You’ve already checked out of the friendship. Plus she lives 7 hours away by flight. Girl just ignore her dramatic ass and find some new friends.  
"I think you're overthinking this.

Don't give his family ""a heads up"". That's an excuse for them to get their panties in a knot and implies they have a legitimate position. They don't. His family should just be expected to behave.

In your shoes, the only thing I'd be doing is reminding my own family where it is and isn't appropriate to smoke. Smoking in rental buses or limos is rude, and might even cost you money. If the venues limit smoking to outside areas, ask your guests to follow the venue's rules. 

If the family complains the response is simple ""We're the hosts. We're okay with it. The venue is okay with it. There isn't a problem here.""

Don't let a problem be invented needlessly."
"&gt; Everyone knows why he is so mad but no one will tell me

I don't have any specific advice but holy shit this part sounds absolutely *infuriating* to me. I can't stand when people pull the vague ""you know what you did""/refusing to tell me crap."
"I work in esports writing, including Overwatch. I am willing to sit down and talk to your partner about this. He is being incredibly unrealistic with his current methods and he will not attain longterm success. I'm not saying he can never be successful; that's very possible and I'm willing to talk to him about it and what he can do to contribute to a household in the meantime. Reach out via DM if this is of interest to you."
"&gt;i feel partly guilty because i don’t want to be seen as the old dad of the group. i don’t like the stigma associated with it (King of Queens comes to mind).

Own your choices. By the sound of it you have a happy marriage with two healthy kids that you take good care of. Those are things to be proud of! 

If someone calls your wife ""your ball and chain"" you really should shut them up. That is not a way to talk about anyone's spouse.  

And this has nothing to do with being old. 29 is just not old by any metric."
I suspect that’s precisely what the unsupportive alcoholic is afraid of.
"&gt; ""well he has a problem with you and he has Asperger's""

How long have they used this as an excuse for him to treat people badly?"
"I had a chuckle at the title and was going to agree this is a ridiculous issue, but  I began reading, and this is...scary?

Kept reading. Oh, damn. This is SCARY. 

And what a sh!t friend for throwing your GRIEF in your face because you actually mentioned her absolute obsession with not wanting to get old is getting...old. 

I have a favorite band. I have travelled to see them. I adore the lead singer who is older than I (Todd, my door is always open!), but I would expect to be dumped by an SO and friends if I was walking around with his *cardboard cutout*. And on Tinder while married to get a ""young hottie""? Lady, quit making all of us middle-agers look like loons. So gross. 

Chick is out of her tree."
I really like those last two sentences. Thank you.
"Tell someone, someone at home and a higher up at the shelter. Make it a point to never be alone with him and refuse to give him any more personal info. Stand firm in the word NO. "
Make it up to her how? You are not obligated to take care of her.
"&gt;My future feels uncertain, but that is better than feeling like a death sentence.

Yes! I remember reading once that what human beings are scared of most is uncertainty. So in a way, staying with your abusive husband -- while awful and full of emotional abuse -- was the safe option because you *knew* what you were in for. Leaving him was an act of bravery and I hope your future is full of warmth and love."
"This whole post is really weird. The stomping picture thing is definitely wrong, but I'm wondering if OP's wife is even really ""draconian"" or if it's just he lets the kids do whatever they want and lets the stepmom be the bad cop when she actually tries to enforce necessary rules and boundaries. I notice he didn't really give any concrete examples except ""well teenagers suck, what can you do."" Teenagers do suck, but parental guidance and reinforcement are what helps them grow and mature past that. Mentally and emotionally checking out because you are lazy and it's easier for you isn't being a good parent or spouse either. 

I would love to hear the wife and daughter's side of this. "
" Block her and do not give her the satisfaction of a reply. Her entire letter is completely about herself. It was, honestly, difficult to read. She wants to manipulate you back into her drama filled world.  "
Tell him right now that
"You know how sometimes (and by sometimes, I mean all the time), people come here despairing over how their boyfriend proposed to them with a giant overpriced diamond that they didn't want, are horrified he thought they'd want, sometimes was bought out of a joint account with money they had explicit other plans for, and in many cases specifically told him they didn't want? And they're all shocked and appalled and have no idea how this could possibly have happened because he's *never* like this, really! 

This. This right here. This is how you tell in advance that you're dating that guy. 

He's young and stupid and well-intentioned and you should absolutely not go too hard on punishing him for it, just sit down with him and go ""okay I really appreciate the intent of your gesture but next time, how about we talk about things like this first,"" and hope that he learns a valuable lesson and never does this again. We all make mistakes and ""tried too hard to be romantic"" is not by far an unforgivable one. 

But do yourself a favor and pay attention to how he responds to that talk, okay? Take it as real, actual, serious, concerning information if he brushes you off like your opinions don't matter or refuses to apologize because his intentions are more important than the results or pitches a tantrum or something. Because it matters."
"Nice try, Duolingo owl"
"He’s an alcoholic who wants you to stay unhealthy just like he is. I think as you move forward in your mental health journey, it’s important to keep in mind that his addiction is very likely to be more important to him than supporting you properly. And I’m sorry about your dad, and hope that treatment brings you peace and healing."
"Next time he asks, tell him:  ""I will only answer that question *one* more time.  *Ever*.  Is *now* when you want me to answer it?""

Alternatively, just completely ignore him every time he asks; once the game is no longer fun any more, he'll stop."
"&gt; kid would grow up with a yard and their own room.

Hold up- that’s YEARS of roommate commitment. What if you get married? Get a bf? Decide to move and turn the place into a 24/7 rental? Sell the place? Then you gotta kick her and her kid out and feel like the bad guy.

Don’t do it! Better to look like the bad guy now, then move her in and want to kick her out later.
"
"OP, you're going to encounter this nonsense a lot more in motherhood, so you really need to step up and open your mouth when someone disturbs your kid. When you go to this place, give the waitress a few moments to ooh and aah. Then say: ""I'm sorry, i know you really like Baby, but the attention is distracting her from her routine and our lunch. Could you please leave us alone to eat when the food is brought?"" 

This waitress is in a service job. She likely gets more tips by being involved with the kids and might even think she's helping. So you have to clarify to her that she's in a wrong position there. By not telling her your wishes, you're doing her a disservice. She probably has other customers she could suck up to. 

You're not a mean person if you request something, OP. As long as you're polite and firm, you can get both great service and a nice lunch."
"It was out of line for him to try and discuss future plans with you while you had just experienced such a huge loss, and there is no such thing as being too emotional after you've just lost a family member. "
"frankly, as a mechanic, you would think that he would WANT to shower more than 3 times a week, but regardless of that fact, there is no need for him to drag his feet. I would stay elsewhere if you can until he gets his shit together because let me tell you, this type of behavior is hard to break and only leads to anger and resentment because eventually you'll feel forced to pick up the slack. "
"Even if you were married, inheritances are solely the property of the person who inherited it. Your boyfriend did something incredibly selfish and cruel and I'm sorry you're feeling like you're in the wrong. You aren't. He is."
"I hate when people use ""practical"" or ""logical"" as shortcut for ""I am being asshole"". And when they use ""irrational"" as shortcut for ""angry when treating disrespectfully"".

He did that to distract from his actions.

He knew what money were for. He could have asked you whether you are ok with buying tires, but he did not,  likely because he knew you would disagree. 

You can trust your mind, but you can not trust what your boyfriend says about your mind. Do not let him convince you that you are irrational for wanting to honor grandma the way she wanted nor for being angry over him going behind your back."
"A little harsh truth, but what they’re saying is true. Tanning is not good for you and it does age you. And while what and how they said it was unkind, there is likely truth to it. People who tan a lot DO look older and their skin looks leathery. It may be time to stop doing that. I’m sorry this happened. It’s much easier to accept criticism when it comes from a place of help and concern."
"Wow, what a story, I’m so glad you were willing to consider another perspective and got safe. "
"You can give him that divorce. Seriously this is emotionally abusive, projection (I'd bet it wasn't porn he was deleting) and for what? Where's the good part of this relationship for you? You're 27 with no kids and a full time job, this is like the best set up possible to move on and be happy. "
"Speaking from the perspective of an adult with a diagnosis that would match ""asperger's syndrome"" before it all got rolled up into the autism spectrum, at 32 years old he should be a functional enough person that he can either work this out with you without having to go through his mother and/or be able to put up with you in social situations. He isn't a child anymore and this is childish behavior. Additionally, I think the way the rest of your family is reacting to this problem is inappropriate and they're kinda coddling him. How independent is he? does he live with his mother? "
"I don't think you're being ridiculous at all, and it was very mature of you to discuss your taste/requirements beforehand, even offering to return and shop with him for a more practical one.  

He's being immature and suffering a bruised ego.  He clearly thinks ""the gaudier ring, the richer the husband"".  He is trying to show himself off under the guise of ""spoiling"" you."
Not gonna lie the title reeeaally doesn't help.
"Sorry if this sounds brutal, but you need to grow a spine.  Both of them are walking all over you and you are letting it happen because you don't want to address it.

The new wife needs to understand she is not your daughter's mother.  And honestly, the whole breaking the picture and stomping on it would have started the divorce right there (with me), but it shouldn't have gotten to that point.

Your daughter needs to understand that you have a new wife who is important to you and there might be some different ground rules when she is with the two of you.  At 13, she is old enough to understand that and have it be expected of her.

But again, your wanting to stay out of it has hurt your relationship with both of them."
“You’ve got nothing to worry about” said every person who ever cheated with a so called platonic friend. 
"&gt;yeah, unfortunately it seems like my uncle doesn't really want to take on any of this either. 

I am not even remotely surprised.  The reason anyone is laying a guilt trip on you about ""playing favorites"" is that uncle doesn't want to take care of Lupe and her baby.  So they think that perhaps if they pressure you..... she can be your problem and they can all wash their hands of her.  Don't bite, OP. 

&amp;#x200B;

But like, what has your mom's side of the family really done for you?  And what has Lupe ever done for you?  It sounds like you got a lot more affection and love from Alice and your dad's side of the family.  Like they consistently made more of an effort to know you and care for you.  Those bonds are important.... and now you're closer to Alice than Lupe.  "
"It seems like your boyfriend takes marriage very seriously. Which is why he got upset knowing that your clients were cheating married men, and why he got *extra* upset that you were saying things like 'relationships are more about image than about love'. In your mind, you're saying that's how wealthy people think but... I think he heard it as you saying that was how *you* see it. It's not like wealthy people and 'regular people' are different breeds of human beings."
"He sounds controlling. He’s testing the waters to see what he can get away with.

Red flag alert!"
She may be curious because she was very prude. It’s exciting to her. 
"I had that same problem!!! But instead of just one person not saying “bless you” it’s everyone. I always wondered “why doesn’t anyone ever say “bless you” to me???” Until one day when I sneezed and none of my friends said “bless you” I jokingly said “How come no one said Bless you?” and they all said they didn’t know I sneezed, they said it sounded weird like I coughed or something. So turns out I have a weird sneeze that sounds like a cough and that’s why no one ever says “bless you” to me haha"
"&gt; She wouldn't be given an ultimatum, she says, and she has done nothing wrong and she won't be changing anything. We had a horrible weekend. 

Never, ever issue an ultimatum unless you plan on going through with it. You didn't, and you blew it.

Of course this relationship is inappropriate. Of course you should judge your wife for carrying on years-long cheating in her past. Of course she knows all this and yet somehow owns your decision making.

Here's what I would do.

""Wife, I've thought about it. Any marriage I want to be part of includes having a wife that respects boundaries and treats me with respect. That's clearly not you. I'm also tired of being a third wheel and coming between you and who is clearly your priority, the old dude. So I'm out. I'm beyond ultimatums, I'm beyond conversations, and even if you told me you'd cut it out I wouldn't believe you now. Here's my lawyer's number. And yes, I'll be going for joint custody.""

And then walk the hell away. 

Do this even if you want to somehow stay with her. She does not respect you. She will not respect you unless you act like someone that deserves respect.

But me? I'd get the hell out of there. She clearly does not give a damn about you or her marriage, and flaunts this in your face.

You get what you tolerate in this world."
"I know that you are in a awkward spot now with you, but in a way, this is a gift. Her drunken outreach, and more importantly your response to it, is an indication to yourself that you are ready to move on and start seriously dating again. Even if you can't with this woman, you can have confidence that you are attractive, and that you can get out there again."
"i love dogs also. i didn't bring my dogs with me on purpose. grad school is very demanding, and while my dogs aren't old, senile, and shitting all over the place, they have their own high maintenance issues, and i knew i just could not take care of them the way they needed right now. my roommate's gf isn't in grad school, but she has a 40+ hour a week job. she's not the right caretaker for this dog, and my classmate and i do not need any extra responsibility. aside from being unfair to me, this situation is RIDICULOUSLY unfair to this dog. and i hate that i hate him so much, because dogs really are great. and i know it's not his fault. but... he sucks."
You are not wrong and you absolutely cannot take Plan B on a regular basis!!!. Research that and show him!!!!
"You said you live in a rural area? In my experience, fewer exciting/interesting things happen in those places. It’s why small towns gossip like crazy. She’s probably bored and wants details for entertainment."
"Before I get to the rest of it: Is she into any ACTUAL underage guys, that you know of? Because if she is, that's a different issue than one I'm about to address, and one you should report. Or, as I suspect based on my own familiarity with women like this, is she into the boyish Harry Styles/Timothee Chalamet types who people like to go ""oh they look 12 lol"" but they are firmly legal adults?

If it's not the former (and if it is please disregard this and tell the police) then this is pretty simple. I can tell you because I went a little bit down this road some myself a long time ago, though luckily not to this extent. She's unhappy and disillusioned with her life and her advancing age and this is the fantasy world she lives in to cope, where her famous and cool (and young!) boyfriend will sweep her away somewhere better. She pokes fun at the ""pedophile"" aspect because she's still self-aware, to some point, that this is ridiculous, and if she names it, she's in on the joke. Of course it's silly! Of course it's all in good fun! Of course she can stop anytime she wants to! She just doesn't want to!

That's why she's devastated when she doesn't meet the celebrity and why she doesn't want you to say you won't play along anymore. She doesn't want the fantasy veil lifted so that she has to face who she really is, which is a 40-something woman who doesn't love her husband and seems to only want life's mean girls to think she's cool, which they never will.

I say all this not to make you feel like you have to do anything about it - because you seem like you don't like her anyway, and that's completely understandable - but to realize, if you do want to go on, what a profoundly sad person she is."
"You are right. 


Unfortunately, there's an idea (and there are a lot of women who do this) that women want the biggest, flashiest jewelry out there.


When I was like 20, I dated a guy for a months, and told him that I'd never want jewelry as a gift. Didn't like it that much, and was picky about it when I did buy it. He bought me a necklace for my birthday. The worst part was that all my female friends didn't understand why I wasn't happy about it, because of course girls say they don't want jewelery but actually expect it.


At 40, and ready to get engaged, he should definitely be respecting what you have to say, when you are the person who it is going to be wearing it."
"&gt;I think your brother is kicking that grief can down the road.

Just like OP's brother I lost my wife to cancer less than five months ago. His response is really common, especially for men -- a family member said to me, ""Women mourn, men replace."" I have no idea if it works or not. I do know that I am in a bereavement group and I'm the only man -- it feels weird and awkward but I keep going.   


For me -- and I'm certainly not saying this is the 'correct' response -- but for me I haven't even considered going on a date, let alone being in a relationship, let alone getting remarried. I'm just not available at a really deep level and it would feel really unfair to inflict that on another person. But I do get it. Some nights if I had a handy drop-in replacement wife available I would probably give in to the temptation to make everything better. Grieving is a hard road, and I can see the appeal of just making it all go away.    


As for your place OP in all this, I can't give any advice. I would hope if I was acting this way then I would want my close friends and family to read me the riot act, and I would hope I would listen, but who is to say? It may just make him more determined than ever. You could gently suggest he's moving too fast and see how he takes it. Or say nothing and support him through the inevitable divorce in a few years. Or who know? Maybe the marriage works. Stranger things have happened."
"I think your friends kind of suck. They wouldn’t be calling you tacky if they actually respected you. Ignore them and maybe try to find better friends. 

That being said let me give you my own old lady advice. I think you need to stop even considering this nonsense about what’s done and what’s not done and whether you’re conforming or not conforming. That’s some high minded bullshit that you quite frankly don’t have the time for anymore. You’re a parent now. Traditional marriage partially existed to guarantee security for the offspring. It’s your job to guarantee your kid’s security. So, you need to consider what you need to do in order to create the most secure family unit you can for your kid. Some considerations: If your boyfriend suddenly dies tomorrow are you and your child legally entitled to the entirety whatever he leaves behind, to include financial assets, insurance, and sentimental items? What about the reverse? If you were to suddenly die would all of your assets go to your boyfriend and your child? Would his/your family be able to contest a will? Who has the legal power to make medical and end of life decisions for your boyfriend and the father of your child? Who has the legal power to make medical and end of life decisions for you? If a medical decision needs to be made for you or the baby while you’re in labor and delivery and you’re incapacitated who has the legal power to make that call? Would you be called if he were in a major accident and vice versa? How does your marital status impact your taxes? Does your marital status leave you open to legal battles with third parties over visitation with your child? (With a disgruntled grandparent who is angry that their grandchild isn’t being raised to be a proper Muslim boy/girl, for example.)

Marriage gives a lot of legal and financial  protection to both parties in many countries. If you’re choosing not to get married then you need to make doubly sure that you, your child, and your boyfriend are all as protected as you can be. Just make sure you do that and ignore your asshole friends. "
"Im not sure if OP texts, but my mom is around the same age and I love sending my mom gifs from reddit to see her reaction. Just the fact that OP is asking for advice on reddit is GOLD. This post is so wholesome"
"You're in couple's counseling. Bring this up in a session. Also, I've got a little side eye for suggesting portraits of exes in the first place. Is there something more serious going on with that? It sounds a bit (I'm reaching a little here) like you and he both tried to deflect some of your marital issues with some edged humor and it didn't work out. I think it's pretty reasonable you're upset, but it also seems like you should be bringing this up with your professional counselor rather than Reddit. This feels like a continuation of your other issues rather than a singular occurrence to be processed on its own. Are you hoping we'll give you permission to leave? Hoping we'll tell you this wasn't a big deal?"
Honestly I bet that’s it. She’s probably trying to be respectful after you shared you had some trauma.
"You have to tell him and if he says anything like, ""I don't understand why you two can't reconcile."" tell him, ""I don't need you to understand, I need you to accept that she is not going to be a part of my life. If you can't I may have to reconsider our relationship."" I can understand if his family life is good then he just doesn't know what having an abusive parent is like, but that doesn't mean he gets to try and force a connection between you and your mother because that's how he thinks things should be."
"yeah, unfortunately it seems like my uncle doesn't really want to take on any of this either. As he was one of the ones pushing for it."
"Hey! My wife is not a native English speaker. While she is very fluent and grammatical correct most of the time there are still hiccups even after 6 and a half years.

Tips:

1. DON'T interrupt her. Let her think it through and she will often figure out a description on her own. Let her ask you for help with a word.

2. DON'T tease her all the time for her pronunciation. A little bit is fine, but always err on the side of less. 

3. DO help her if she asks, but decide beforehand the boundaries of what you two will work on. My wife has trouble with ""sk"" endings (ask, desk, task). For a month that was the ONLY thing I corrected. Then, when she mastered that, we moved on. 

4. Be comfortable with silently sharing an experience. A walk in the park can be mutually enjoyable and romantic without any words.

5. Enjoy being her guide to your culture. It's seriously the best part. It made me re-appreciate so many small things. I introduced her to ""The Grinch"". We watched the OG cartoon and at least 2 other versions afterwards. She still can't remember his name and calls him the ""green Christmas thief""."
It turns out no one can offer another perspective if you're not open about what's happening.  It's been so eye-opening to be in a space where people discuss their intimate relationships openly and honestly when it can be so tempting to only show the good.
"I’m trying to think of how to put this delicately, but it’s highly possible that this is an ‘of a different time’ situation. My family is mostly women, and I was fortunate to grow up knowing several generations (my great grandmother/BFF in the whole world passed when I was a teenager). One thing I realized in talking to my SO not long ago is: boys don’t grow up hearing women’s stories like girls do, and we end up with very different perspectives on our/our family’s history (even history in general) as a result. I’m going somewhere with this I promise.

I’ve noticed that women in our mother’s generation (you and I are close enough in age) have a very different view of gender and relationships than we do. Even though they came up in the Second Wave, they were still raised by their mothers, who were in turn raised by their mothers and so on. Those cultural shifts take time, and I think they’re just starting to bear fruit on an interpersonal level. Think about this: your mother was probably *a full grown adult* when women got the ability to open credit cards without a husband’s permission. It seems like ancient history, but it isn’t. 

My mother, SO’s mother and aunts all tell stories about the toxic ideas about relationships, men and marriage they were doctrinated with. *They expected* their husbands to be some degree of awful or apathetic, and they just had to suck it up. *They expected* to do all/most of the housework and child-rearing, even if they also worked. *They expected* to silently and nobly soldier on while their husbands—blissfully unaware of the amount of work running a shared household and life together requires—worked and played golf on the weekends. The first no-fault divorce law wasn’t passed until 1969, and even then, the social stigma and significant reduction in women’s standard of living after divorce (at a time when women were significantly underrepresented in the workforce, and nearly absent in high-paying jobs) all contributed to the environment in which our mothers married. 

Maybe your mom just turned on a dime and gave up one day. *Or* maybe she finally got tired of doing everything. Maybe the fact that your dad has had ~20 years to reflect on why his marriage ended and *is still completely baffled by it* is indicative of the kind of husband he was. 

Thing is, I wouldn’t expect a woman our age to be as willing to suffer in silence as our mothers. For the most part, we were *not* raised to prioritize men the same way they were. I’m telling you all this in a long-winded way because well, maybe this is the good kind of existential crisis: the kind that shifts your perspective and leads to growth. The kind of emotional work that our fathers by and large *didnt have to do* because women were mostly doing it for them. It sounds like your relationship is equitable but hey, never hurts to check in right? Circumstances will change over time and things like division of labor will have to be renegotiated; what a blessing for your wife (and that’s 100% genuine, not sarcasm) to have a husband who will take the initiative to say: hey, is this still working for you? Does this still feel fair? Rather than waiting for one or both of you to feel resentful or overwhelmed. 

Maybe if your dad had been that kind of husband, he wouldn’t still be in the dark.

Even if it doesn’t feel like it right this second, you’re doing great. "
"You're under absolutely no obligation to make life more comfortable for him and his gf. Any drama that could stir due to her insecurities is to be solved between them. Maybe he's the one who can't be mature enough to deal with you living in the same building.

You do what's best for your life at the moment. I'd not give up a good place because of that reason he's giving you."
"i dont think its any of your parents business, really. unless your boyfriend wants to tell them, theres no reason to."
"Based on her reasoning to revisit this discussion, it sounds like she wants to double down on what she said.  I wouldn’t give her the opportunity."
"So you're telling me that the only thing standing between you and the quiet weekend you wanted anyway is... a brief conversation with one of your best friends?   


Hm, if only I could think of some advice to give you!"
"Stop doing shit for him. Don’t do his laundry, don’t cook him dinner. Don’t do anything that benefits him. He doesn’t give you the courtesy of even speaking to you or treating you like he gives a fuck. Take care of yourself and your children and let him figure his own shit out. "
"Yeah, someone else also brought up how hard it would be to kick her out. Somehow that didn’t even cross my mind before I posted this. 

I’m very happy I went with my other cousin. She doesn’t want kids and she agreed to a lease."
"Hmm, maybe you could ask him why it is so important to him that you take this one. He can tell his reasons (maybe treating you well or thinking it makes things more meaningful). Then calm his worries by giving examples of how he is already treating you well and so on and then propose a solution that is acceptable to you. By explaining that you would like to have a ring you can wear to work because it is important to you you could go for a second, possibly cheaper one that you actually like to wear and you could wear the one he chose for special occasions - if you want to. 

Or you explain again that this one is not after your taste and that you can not wear it at work and that you would like his opinion on the rings you might actually like. In a way it is a bit strange, i mean he wants to marry you and you don't seem to be a flashy person, why is it so hard to accept that you want something that fits you? I don't know. I personally would reward the good intentions with a compliment but make clear that you want something that is more you and that you can wear at work and that you would like him to help you find that.

Maybe he will calm down soon, it sounds like he is hurt because he wanted to surprise you with something ""better"" in his eyes and then it backfired. He will get over it, especially if you show that you see the intention."
He chose to be your Dad. That’s amazing. 
"She said she prefers older men. They flirt and text daily. He gets defensive when you bring it up. Yeah, you have reason to be suspicious. "
"Your husband turned out ok because he’s a man. Women like your MIL are sexist - so their sons can do no wrong (my grandma had three boys and they heard nothing of what my sister and I got from her). 

You’re not overreacting, and even her jokes are so damaging. Your husband needs to be on board with your boundaries, and he needs to be the one to express them to her, as she is likely not at all listening to you. Yes daycare, and yes limit her contact to only when the two of you are around."
"Welcome to your opportunity to reignite your sex life!

Something about this intrigued her, ask her what it was. Ask her if she’s interested in any element of that. Maybe it was being outside, maybe it was being seen, maybe it was watching, but something here caught her attention. 

You’ll need to handle it sensitively, but this is definitely an opportunity for your relationship. "
"She isnt a bridezilla.  She is being brainwashed into an MLM. They use very effective manipulation tactics to recruit and brainwash their members.  They will destroy more than just your wedding.  You need to get your fiance out.  If she is unwilling,  then you need to leave.  MLM have ruined many lives and marriages and will leave you bankrupt and heartbroken.    

I implore you to put the wedding on hold while you get this sorted. You could lose your fiance forever if you dont. "
"i’m very disturbed by the fact that it was his FIRST WORDS when he found out - not “yay!” or anything surprised and joyful about becoming a father.... his first thought was “i need to control this even though it will upset her”. and i’m also extremely disturbed at his threat not to show up at the hospital. so his support as the father of your child is conditional. your method of delivery is your choice, assuming no complications happen - but what if you end up having a c-section that isn’t your choice? what if it’s an emergency and the only way it can happen? he’s going to blame you for it and not be there for you while you recover from major surgery? he’s going to make you feel guilty and miserable while you go through a harrowing recovery process? 

there isn’t even a rational reason behind his insistence. all he should care about is making you comfortable while you carry his child and making sure you and the child are healthy and happy.  the only reason he’d be acting this way is a need to control.

it’s well documented that a controlling partner only gets worse and more controlling, the more time passes. if you’re able - if you have support from your family or anyone - i would urge you to consider breaking up. i know it’s going to be difficult to raise this baby without its father as your partner, and it’s probably not what you dreamed of, but before it’s too late - you deserve better. being alone is better than being guilt-tripped and controlled. and one day you will find someone who deserves you and loves you without needing to control you. i promise."
Something tells me your depression and the way this guy treats you are more intertwined than you think they are. Did anything change between the two of you around the time your weight gain started?
"If they're not backing off then going and staying with your mate sounds like a good idea. Basically you have to set a boundary here, you're not willing to talk about her and so is they bring her up that means they want to end the conversation. Are you planning on moving out permanently soon?"
"Aw that’s so sweet and generous of your boyfriend’s mom! It sounds like she just wants you to experience Italy to the fullest.

If it were me, I’d make her a thank you card in the form of a little scrap book/photo album. Like, first page being a letter thanking her for the experience and all you got to do because of it, and then a little collection of photos that commemorate the experience to make her feel like she was there. And she will, too, as I’m sure she’s experienced a lot of those things!"
You are now his parent and it’s very unlikely this dynamic will ever change. 
He's probably feeling embarrassed that he was so vulnerable so early on so he's running away from it. I don't know if/how much you've texted him since but it would be worth messaging to say that you like him and don't think any differently of him. Match his vulnerability with some of yours.
I'd let it go but is it possible she thinks something about your religion that it wouldn't be appropriate?
"Your parents are really shitty, too. I understand that you don't want to ""lose"" them, but what would that really be losing?

They've failed quite miserably to raise you and treat you fairly, and I don't see why you would owe them much at this point.

I would consider scaling back significantly on your time with your parents as well. You could also suggest therapy (with just you and your parents) if you're interested in that and if they're willing.

Otherwise, sounds like a pretty unhealthy family dynamic that is taking much more from you than what you're getting out of it."
"\&gt; How normal is is for my wife to be this protective and what are things we can do to work on this? 

It's not.

\&gt; Is this something she really needs to be in therapy for? 

And you as well. 

\&gt; how can I preserve my relationship with my sister and her husband?  

By addressing this issue with your wife. This policy is going to actively hurt your children in the long run. 

&amp;#x200B;

While I understand some points of restricting access to your kids, this policy is blindly out of hand. And it's absolutely NOT healthy. This isn't helicopter parenting, it's alienation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Your policy is robbing your children the ability to create bonds with their extended family. It's also destroying the bonds you currently have. Full disclosure, I'm personally not a fan of homeschooling, for two reasons. First, often the parent isn't qualified to teach (which I don't know you or your wife so I'm not going to throw a judgement on that nor should we discuss it). Secondly, and part of the heart of the problem: It's socially isolating and it removes an important part childhood education which is societal norms, interactions, and the ability to read and trust (or not trust) people. You can not provide social education through books. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, there are some people who totally get homeschooling right. They are giving their kids a quality education and enroll them in activities so the kids get the social aspects they truly need. But in this case, I do see one fall out in your situation: Your kids are being actively socially isolated. I'm not coming at you for homeschooling (for all we know you are doing it for the awesome education part), but it's relevant to the situation due to the social aspects that are missing. Being alone with other people away from your parents is an integral part of development. Yes we need to guide our children, but they need to be able to function without you and you can't do that while hovering. While the education may be spot on, because you are leaving out the ""no family men"" part, you are also isolating the people who associate with the ""non-family men"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Your sister is rightfully angry. Her and her husband are a package deal. What if your sister had a child but said to you ""Hey you can watch the baby, but your wife can't come! We don't let women not related watch our child"". There is NO good reason for this. And I know you claim there was no abuse, but this is a very common thing with people who either was or was exposed to some form of abuse. It's an overcompensation and while the heart may be in the right place, it's missing the mark and creating new and different issues. If you want your kids to be able to accurately judge people, make bonds, learn how to socialize, and be able to grow as their own persons, you need to give them some space. Not much. But just enough. You need them to be able to experience life with other people. Humans are not meant to be isolated. We are not built that way. We are extremely social creatures and when we get robbed of that, it makes adulthood very hard. It makes you unrealistically un-trusting (look at your wife).

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm with you on ""no divorce"" on this. Your wife isn't trying to abuse, isolate, or hurt your children. She's trying to protect them. But not letting them experience anything potentially bad keeps them from also potentially experiencing anything good. And I get she isn't big on the therapy idea, but marriage needs healthy compromise and you need to insist on this. And if she won't go, then you need to go. Before your sister acts rashly in this because she and her husband are being personally insulted by this. I don't care if that wasn't your intention. That is your action. 

&amp;#x200B;

For what it's worth, I say this as a mom and a wife. I have been in therapy for C-PTSD and anxiety for years now. It's really hard to not let my fears overcome me when it comes to my daughter. But I have to let her live and experience life. I have to ensure my problems don't become her problems just because I've seen the worst of the world. There is still so much good out there and many awesome people. "
Get him to the Herr-dressers asap.
"Get an adult boyfriend who understands that you're a whole separate person? I know that sounds harsh, but he sounds like a lot of work for minimal reward. He's not driven, he's not focused, he's got a handful of things he likes and that's all he does. You're the one in school, working, playing sports, and doing your share of the housework plus reminding him to do his. Where's the upside for you in this? Especially since as described you don't actually need to go to the gym on your day off?"
She's sad she got caught.  Be strong.
"&gt;Its constantly, “you need to punish your daughter for being rude.” And I usually just shrug and say, “She’s 13, what do you expect.”

So you're not disciplining your daughter for her rudeness towards your wife?

No wonder she's mad and trying to do it herself.

&gt;her saying that I am “not being a parent”

She's telling you exactly what the problem is and you're refusing to listen. A lot of people would KILL to be able to know the cause of their strife and disagreements."
Your husband is a huge jerk and is intentionally insulting you.
Holy shit this is like the best advice that I have ever read.
"First off they got this line from a Jon LaJoie song from about 10 years ago that is explicitly MOCKING these types of guys. So they're not only disgusting but stupid. 

How is your brother's relationship with your parents? I'm not suggesting you ""tattle"", but if your dad is a strong, mature man I doubt he would be proud of his son acting this way. It might be worth discussing with them hos behavior and his reputation on campus. 

In the meantime, avoid him and don't engage. They aren't treating women as equal, so nothing you can say will get through to him. Refuse to engage."
"&gt;He very will may have grieved while she was sick.

Not saying his behavior is healthy (it's not), but this is almost certainly true. As someone who has been on the deathbed watch, all my heaviest grief happened before the death. "
"Have you ever asked your mom the same question? If you’re comfortable with it, it might help you to hear her side of things too. 

Your Dad sounds like he had no idea and it felt out of the blue but I’d be curious if your Mom has a much different story/take on things.

Definitely talk to your wife. You’re allowed to bring your fears and insecurities to your spouse, ya goof, that’s *how* you avoid that future disconnect. 

Maybe some conversation will help you, maybe you two will decide that individual therapy for you or couple’s counseling would be useful. At any rate, that’s what good, lasting marriage involves, right? Tackling problems that arise together as a couple?"
The understanding you need to reach with your parents is to tell them that their lifelong prioritizing Laura over you has had its predictable effect: that you can no longer tolerate her or their favoritism.   Then just withdraw from all of them.
"It was definitely an insensitive thing to say to someone you don’t know very well,  and I am always against negative comments on someone’s appearance unless they ask. 

That being said, is it possible that the people you are close to (not the one that started it) are concerned about your tanning habits? Tanning beds are really dangerous, and in addition to aging you, they cause skin cancer. I’m not judging - I’ve used them in the past, so I totally get the appeal, but those are the two reasons I stopped. I’ve seen younger women that tan too much and I’m not gonna lie, they look way older than they are. It’s not something that happens overnight, so it can be hard to quit. 

I’m guessing no one meant for you to take it that way. Some people don’t mind aging a bit in order to look tan, but it is common knowledge that that is a side effect. So maybe they didn’t really mean anything by it. Or maybe they were trying to open a dialogue about tanning and why it’s so bad for you since they had the opening. Although skin cancer is much worse than aging, imho."
"You didn’t send a regrettable text....

You stood up for yourself and set a boundary. 

Stick to it, I’m proud of you. This guy seems like a player from what you’ve said, sounds like he loves to play games and is constantly trying to reel you back in, only to ghost again. I’m betting a few of his texts were late night. 

You deserve better.  I hope for your sake he listens and never bothers you again"
"My sister stopped using tanning beds when someone asked if she was my mum. I'm 18 months older than you.

The truth is that tanning beds are bad for your skin and do age you. But your friends also went about this in a very mean way. I probably wouldn't want to speak to them either. 

&gt;or said anything nice about me at all
The thing is, what was happening didn't really need anyone to step in and say ""yes, but aubandtroi is a nice person tho!"" because they were attacking a habit you have, not something you are."
"&gt;If someone calls your wife ""your ball and chain"" you really should shut them up. That is not a way to talk about anyone's spouse.

Never underestimate the power of a simple ""that's not a nice thing to say"" in response to an insulting joke."
Exactly. He doesn’t want OP to better herself so that she won’t leave him.
*Duolingo wants to know your location*
Pretty douchey. Big issue to me is that he didn't care much that you felt hurt about it. Big red flag that would probably make me leave my partner if its a young relstionship.
"1) Wants you to believe you can't take care of yourself

2) Blows up over you being friendly with a male cashier

3) Wants you to think no one will be nice to you

\*red flags\*"
"&gt;He replied by rolling his eyes. ""Not now. I know you're on your period, but not tonight.

&gt;""I'm going to leave,"" he told me. ""If you keep going on, I'm going to leave.""

...Holy shit, really? He insults and cusses at you. He's never going to let this die, debt paid or not. He'll always talk about it in the same way, either as a current thing or a past thing."
"This is a good course of action. Do not water down the inappropriateness of these comments. I felt disgusted reading them and horrified that a grown ass adult woman would be okay implying such horrors to a small child.

Your concerns are valid. These “jokes” are not funny and are absolutely nasty."
You need to be honest with him and tell him that his version of support is driving a wedge between you to the extent that you are considering breaking up.  Explain why that's so and go from there.
My mom also had this policy of family only and it didn't protect me since I was in fact abused by a family member. It only isolated me more and left me alone with my abuser on frequent occasions since sleepovers at a friends house were off limits because what if their dad does something? This is a terrible policy.  
Take this as a great opportunity to learn to be honest with people and put your foot down. Being able to speak your mind is an important life skill.
"This isn't about the wedding cost or debt. Your DH is a poor-mouther. You know those people - everything is so expensive, they don't know how they'll manage, oh, if only they had the money they used to have-- on an on. Poor mouthing. It's a personality quirk, and anyone around them gets the benefit - trust me, his co-workers know all about his money woes as well, because its where his brain goes when he's got nothing to say. Its a deep groove in his personality. Its one of the things that makes him him.

How you'll deal with it, idk. But he's going to be 70yo and moaning about how he used to get coffee for $2. Every. Single. Morning."
Seriously. And it's not that he's lying. I truly think he believes he would never let their friendship go in that direction or come between us.  But we're all human. And IMO if you don't want to cheat you avoid situations that lend themselves to cheating. 
"If you need to leave her because of this, it's okay. It's been 3 years, and things haven't improved and she hasn't made any constructive steps toward addressing it. If this isn't the relationship you want to be in, it's okay to break up. You're not a douchebag--the two of you just aren't compatible."
This has always been his mother's response. She is an artist and has always tried to nurture his feelings. When we were kids I threw mud at him a few times when we were swimming in a lake and he dunked my head under water multiple times (he was much bigger than me) and she told me I shouldn't have bugged him. Took her month before she apologized and realised what he had done.
"I think this is going to be unpopular but I’m going to share it anyways:

I think society socalializes men to hypervalue the young, fit female body, sometimes to the exclusion of all other female body types. It’s not their fault, but it is their responsibility to unpack this, and get over it.

I think the majority of men could benefit from some self reflection or consciousness-raising in this area, just as I feel I as a white woman am responsible for putting in some work around my white privilege, a system I was born into and benefit from, just by virtue of being white. 

In the same way, many men could benefit from putting in a little work to discover why they are attracted to, and benefit from, one very specific (and statistically small) body type.

I hope this benefits OP. He seems like a good man, who is trying to be thoughtful about these feelings, but western society doesn’t offer men a ton of wisdom or guidance in this area unfortunately, so I can appreciate he’s struggling."
"Yup, be there for those kids. Let them talk about their mom, encourage that they get professional help dealing with their own grief, and navigating their new family dynamic. "
"Oh wow potentially? We did have a chat once about religion at a conference, I said I didn't follow any religions after a tough upbringing in Christianity, but am quite spiritual now in my own way. She's Hindu if that gives any context."
"Tell him what bothers you about it. To put myself in your shoes, I think i would feel like my boyfriend was turning the very idea of getting engaged to me into a joke. Like, ""haha, isn't it crazy to imagine I would actually propose to you?"" And even if you're not ready to get engaged NOW, it's still hurtful that he would act like the very idea of proposing to you is laughable. I also imagine that it might be embarrassing to be put on the spot like that in front of other people. And from his point of view, of course you will know when he is serious--but from your perspective, what if the joke proposals become increasingly elaborate? What if one day he does give you a very convincing proposal but then says ""lmao just kidding!"" You'd be devastated. 

I would sit him down and really dig deep into your feelings on this. ""When you do this, I feel hurt because \_\_\_\_, and I feel humiliated because \_\_\_. And when I ask you to stop doing something and you keep doing it, I feel powerless. I feel like you are not listening to me. It makes me feel like you don't care. When I tell you that something bothers me and you keep doing it anyway, it makes me worry that you will dismiss my feelings over more serious issues too. I need for you to stop making this joke, because it hurts me. Can you do that for me?""

Someone refusing to stop making a particular ""joke"" even when you have repeatedly asked them to stop is a red flag for me, tbh. It's not a warning sign of anything particularly awful necessarily, but I find this behavior demoralizing and exhausting. My dad does it and it makes me not ever want to be vulnerable about any real feelings with him, because I can't trust him to respect those feelings. Your partner in life should be someone you can be completely vulnerable with. You should be able to say ""this hurts me"" and trust that they will care and stop, even if it's something small/ "
"&gt;My husband sided with her and said if you keep making problems she will go back to india.

Solution: KEEP MAKING PROBLEMS

Seriously you are a mama of a new baby, you don't have time or energy to put up with this sh!t. Respecting cultures goes both ways; she has to make an effort to respect your culture as you do yours. Anytime she jumps bad at you put some steel in your voice and tell her to stop. Pick up baby and leave the room. Do whatever you need to do to establish boundaries and comfort in your own home. Buck up! and tell your husband what's good. If mama doesn't like it she can leave. "
So I see you mention in your other post about the dog not being allowed on the lease. I think it's time to pull in the big guns IE talking with your landlord. I would frame it pretty much the way you have here - that your roommates took in a dog without your consent &amp; that you're worried that the pee/poop etc will damage your place and the constant barking irritates your neighbors. That you've tried to get them to rehome the dog but they haven't. Ideally the landlord will speak to them about the situation and ask them to get rid of the dog.  At the very least the fact that you take this stand with the landlord might mean that he will take any damage the dog does out of their portion of the security deposit rather than yours.
"Your friend sounds like a predator. He specifically goes after much younger girls who are emotionally vulnerable. 

You should say something but the question is will he listen?"

"A lot of people, especially people who have never struggled with their weight, don't understand what healthy and sustainable weight loss looks like.  They think weight loss requires eating tiny meals or eating unpalatable foods.  They think it means total deprivation because they've gotten their weight loss information from the media, not from medical professionals or detailed research.  

Keep up the good work and your progress should be self-evident.  In the meantime, tell your boyfriend that what or how you eat isn't up for discussion, that you don't micromanage or criticize his own diet, and that you deserve the same respect that you give him.  Give him a serious ""Come to Jesus"" talk about it and really lay all your feelings about the way he's been treating you on the table.  Maybe a solid heart to heart will set him straight. 

If not, who wants to be with someone who is constantly second-guessing you and treating you like you're dumb when you've put in some serious research and effort to find the right path for you?"
"I have Aspergers/high-functioning autism. I'm also fully capable of being civil, treating other people with respect, and not forcing my struggles and symptoms to become other people's responsibility.

It's not his ""fault"" that his family has enabled him to use his diagnosis as a shield and ""get out of trouble/unpleasant situations for free"" card. But it's also not your fault, and it's definitely not your responsibility - nor anybody else's - to cater to his every little whim and discomfort.

People with autism come in every shape, size, and flavor as neurotypical people - some are kind, some are funny, some are introverts, some are extroverts, etc. There are plenty of self-centered assholes in the world, and some of those assholes happen to be autistic.

Autism doesn't make anybody a difficult jerk to be around. Some difficult jerks just happen to be autistic, and another subset of those autistic jerks like to hide behind their diagnosis like a shield. Please don't allow those idiots to make the rest of us look bad.

F***ing.

&gt; She went on Tinder &amp;set her age preference 18-24 and told her husband. He got mad and made her delete it but she’s on it again and he doesn’t know. 

God."
"Oh wow. That is scary accurate, down to the two people she's obsessed with. I honestly don't know if she's truly attracted to underage boys but she is definitely attracted to what she calls 'underdeveloped' boys. Joking or not, it makes me highly uncomfortable. Beyond that, you are right. She's also obsessed with having a 'squad' like Taylor Swift's and has called me crying before because she doesn't have a girl squad like everyone on Instagram does. I've told her so many times that Instagram is not real. None of that is real. Taylor Swift isn't even friends with the people in her squad-that was just a music video. She says that she knows that but she still wants it and she's depressed that she can't have a life like that. And the mean girl thing? Yep. That's 100% her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for showing me this perspective. It does make me feel for her, so much, and I hate that someone can be so unhappy with themselves they create a fantasy at a detriment to their real life. However, red lines were crossed with me and I can't go back. I can't have people in my life that do those kinds of things, or that use words for the sole purpose of hurting. I used to love her. A lot. But it's her own behavior that has caused me to feel this way. I have to worry about putting myself back together after losing my Dad and Grandpa. I don't have the emotional reserves to be there for her anymore."
"Okay so I am going to totally own this comment for now and will eventually delete later because I post on a lot of professional threads and don't want poor grieving families to look through my comment history and find this, but alas:

I write nasty, wild, crazy erotic gay fanfiction despite being a relatively vanilla straight girl. I kept this a secret from my then boyfriend, now husband for more than a year of us dating. He asked me seriously one night if I had ever lied to him and luckily I hadn't except for the ""omission"" of the giant part of me that brought me not only joy, but other people joy too (over 100,000 people have read one of my fics and yes I'm flexing right now don't judge). I couldn't look him in the eye and say I hadn't lied, so I had to tell him the whole ugly truth about it all. 

And of course he IMMEDIATELY looked it up and read some of it, which was mortifying for both of us once he realized I wasn't joking. He was astonished and couldn't look at me for a half hour.

After a few weeks of randomly blurting out ""...but gay porn? Really?!"" he came around to it being a hobby and an outlet. Now he is about as fully supportive as he could be, which means when I'm writing he is as obnoxious as possible making suggestive noises and calling out random dude names.

I wish he'd have known sooner. I wish I didn't think it was something to hide from someone who loves me as much as my husband does. Of course you've only been dating this guy for two months and I'm not telling you to read it to him at bedtime or anything, but he was snooping and that's what happens when you stick your hand in a bee hive: you're probably going to get stung. You didn't shove it in his face and say he had to be part of it. Give him time to process and if he wants to go his separate ways then that's okay, you'll find someone down the line that won't mind or might even like it and will love you anyway. Never compromise any part of yourself that isn't destructive or harmful for a partner.

Enjoy your erotica and best of luck to you!"

"You need to stop taking so much Plan B without speaking to an OB/GYN about it. I am not a doctor, but that much Plan B must surely fuck up your hormones. And your boyfriend really needs to get to therapy for his anxiety. Honestly, it may be at the point where you need to stop having sex with him unless he is doing something for his anxiety."
"Does your fiance really want no one to smoke at the wedding, or does he just want to not have to hear his parents freak out about it at the wedding?

Because if your fiance would really prefer people not smoke at the wedding, that is a discussion you to have to seriously have. It's not an unrealistic request from a host, and you are both equally the hosts of this party.

If he what he really wants his parents not to freak out at him during the wedding, easier way to handle that is to deputize an aunt/uncle or sibling to handle his parents and, if they start about it, have them to be the person to tell the parents in no uncertain terms they are too suck it up and behave, and not bother the groom.

"It is absolutely not ok that he is poking at your stomach and criticizing the photogenic level of your biceps, and you need to stamp that out hard. Tell him you don't give a shit about how your biceps look in pictures so he can knock that right off.

 If you don't stand up for yourself nobody will - if he says he's frustrated that you slept in, tell him you're frustrated that he doesn't do his share of the chores. If he wants to pick on you about how many times you've gone to the gym, ask how many times he's gone to class. 

Your whole post is ""what am I doing wrong"" and the true answer is putting up with his shit."
"&gt;I did not ask him or his mom (who lives in the West Coast and doesn't know what I eat) for nutritional advice, just for support 

Try taking that back, and telling him you need him to never comment on what you eat or how much you eat or when you eat or really say anything about your food choices ever, that this is a boundary that you need for your own well-being, and it's fine if he doesn't think you're making good choices or if he thinks you're not doing it ""right,"" as long as he thinks those things SILENTLY.  Tell him you don't need him to agree with you about your food choices, you just need him to stop mentioning it in any context. And for you part, you just do you, and don't explain to him why you're doing what you're doing, in case he sees that as an opening to a two-way discussion about it."

"This^^^^ should be the top comment.

And I’ll add that if you’re looking to be with someone whose body will *never* change, will never sag, will never get some dimples and creases, well you might as well stay single. 

I don’t mean to sound harsh, but I have to wonder what world people live in where they think their partner is going to look the same forever. That world is a fantasy, and it will always lead to disappointment.

That’s why it’s so important to find a deep compatibility, and a deep sexual attraction, that goes beyond how flat their stomach is, or how perky their breasts are, etc. because those things will *always* change. Without a doubt. Even with plastic surgery, it will never be the way it was when your partner was X year old, or weighed Y lbs. 

Just as her body will change, OP, your body will change as well. And one day, if you live long enough, you’ll have all sorts of bodily functions and features that are anything but sexy. I’m sure you’d expect your wife to still love every bit of you when that day comes, extend her the same courtesy."
"You are happy with them and your husband is being extremely supportive of you by caring for you and the family during your recovery. I think you need to accept that for what it is. 

He might like your breasts less than when you had implants. And that's okay. He's gotten used to your physical appearance and been majorly attracted to you for 11 years with them in. But here he is, supporting you anyhow and caring for you with love. 

Give him time to adjust and adapt and focus on his actions instead of your insecurities."
"Agree-and I'd take it ome step further. 

Sex is an important part of relationships, and it's not shallow to end things because sex drives are mismatched and you're sick of the pressure. If he can't stop asking you constantly for sex (and tbh I am not optimistic here), you're gonna end up in a compromise that makes you feel violated and still doesn't satisfy him. This is just the first 6 months-how will he act if you're ever seriously ill, or when you're out of commission after childbirth if that's something you want? 

Honestly, I wish I had spent less of my younger years in relationships with this kind of mismatch, and if I could do it over I'd end them sooner. It's exhausting to negotiate intimacy every day before you've even really gotten to know someone."
Subtract $150 when you give her your portion of the rent.
"I think that's definitely one of the hardest things for me. That's why I feel so weird around my family. I don't know what they believe about me.

I don't know if they do it because of the drama factor or they genuinely believe they would be betraying his trust because he doesn't want anything to do with me."
"Oh boy.  My best friend had PPD and turned into someone similar overnight. I convinced her to go to the ER and she was committed for about a week. Her hubby and I visited her and took turns caring for the baby. You need to have the baby with someone and, honestly, I’d call her OB. They may very well have you take her to the ER. 

She’s sick. She can’t make safe choices for herself right now but please get her help, right away. Do not let her be alone with the baby until she’s had treatment. "
"Get out of there, dude. She CLEARLY values whatever she has going with this older guy way more than any relationship with you."
"I mean, he had a two-year affair with a married woman, lied to you about it repeatedly, and you’re worried about *her* character?"
"It's loneliness from the isolation. It's quite easy to end up being \_effectively\_ ditched by your social network, just because you can't ever go to things - so you stop getting remembered and invited to things. It's not malice particularly, it's just oversight. 

&amp;#x200B;

In particular, if you're in this position, you feel you're missing out on basic intimacy, and I'd interpret the request for a kiss as such. If you're long term ill, dating is just not a thing you're doing, and she possibly feels she's missing out on that. 

&amp;#x200B;

The basic solution I might offer, is to try and be supportive with going out to things. Include her when you're going somewhere, and make an effort to make it 'friendly' to her condition/needs. I don't want to second guess particularly, but with respiration and joint issues, she probably can't walk far or stand long. But something like a cinema trip, or a meal at a restaurant, where she could be dropped off at the door might do the trick. With plenty of 'lead time' to get ready, get there, get settled etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes just hanging out goes a long way. "
"You don't owe her the house. But you do owe her a clear answer yes or no. 

But it might help your family ease off if you don't give room for this kind of pressure. It's fair to say (directly, to Lupe, don't feed family drama by spreading things around and being available to everyone's critique) ""I've decided to go in a different direction. I'm not up for living with a baby."" This is clear and true and unarguable. It's just a statement of what is."
"He shouldn't be manipulating you into having sex with him. Boners aren't a disease, they'll go down eventually. This has less to do with sex and more to do with his lack of boundaries, which is gross. Even if he doesn't force you,  he whines like a child and doesn't care whether or not you want it. That's gross. It becomes less an activity you both enjoy and do for the sake if mutual satisfaction and closeness and more a duty out of obligation, which is just a path to resentment and misery. You need to put your foot down. "
"This is a decision between you and your care providers. I recommend talking to your doctor/midwife more in depth about this and maybe a therapist since it sounds like you have some stuff you maybe need to work through. I'd also encourage you to read birth stories over on r/babybumps. Not all vaginal deliveries are hellish nightmares that are days of pain (mine certainly weren't--Ive had worse headaches). And a C-section is not ""the easy way"" to have a baby. It's birth. There's no easy way. Do your research, talk to your care providers and make the decision that is best for you, your baby and everyone else can suck on a lemon.

Your boyfriend has less than 0 input on your medical decisions. He doesn't have a right to be there. Remind him of that fact. He gets 0 say. So he can be supportive and support you while you give birth the way you want or he can wait in the waiting room while you have somebody who *does* support you in there. 

Same goes for breast/formula feeding and visitors after baby and all the other things that are going to come up. **Don't let anyone pressure you into doing anything you don't want to** Listen to your healthcare team, follow your instincts and stand your ground. 

I would like to encourage you both to get into couples counseling. Parenting is tough and you need to be a great team. You guys need to develop your communication skills before baby arrives."
"I'm not anymore, but I used to be a mechanic.  I didn't shower in the morning, but took long hot showers in the evening to scrub the grease, grime, and sweat off me.  Not showering for 3 days is gross under normal conditions, and super nasty if you work a physical labor job.

Also, WTF OP?  You pay rent here, tell him to get the shit fixed or you leave.  This isn't even a problem of waiting for maintenance logistics (getting parts, or whatever), he's just being a lazy-ass and doesn't care how it affects you."
He won't even put water in the dog bowl when he has work to do and you're the one that pays the bills year round. You might as well be single for that. Then you could just have to worry about yourself. Maybe show him She Divorced Me Because I Left Dishes by The Sink
"&gt;The coordinator just forgot about me because i live far away.

I mean I'm glad that communication won out in the end, but I feel like this is something that's going to happen more often, especially if you live far away.  Speaking as someone in your situation, either be prepared to assert yourself beforehand or you may find yourself getting left out more."
"Yes, I like this one very much!"
"He’s trying really hard to support you. I think give him some more credit for that. If you keep pressing, you’re pressuring him to give you the answer you want, and he’ll either be uncomfortable, or start giving you those insincere compliments that you say you don’t want."
"&gt;EDIT: I should add that me and my family are not very close at all, I was in boarding school from a very young age till early teens and once I moved with my mom it was mostly verbal and physical abuse, I moved out when I was 18 and I have always kept my self to my self.

&gt;I don't know how to appease her or help her understand.

So the short answer is, you don't. You disentangle yourself so that if she's mad at you, you can simply let her be mad. You make it so she doesn't have any power or leverage over you, and then you live your life indifferent to her approval. As an obvious example, she shouldn't have any say on whether you can see your dog or not.

I agree with u/BrokenPaw that getting married after six months and then not telling anyone for several years is kind of a huge slap in the face to your family... but it sounds like that's appropriate in this case. The problem is that you're trying to act as if your relationship with them is normal when it isn't. I think you need to assess just where you stand with them and make sure you're prepared for them to react badly to you going off their script."
"Hey I’m so glad for you. Congratulations on your new chapter and I wish you all the very best. Lots of luck on your journey.

"&gt;Teenagers do suck, but parental guidance and reinforcement are what helps them grow and mature past that

Exactly - OP talks about things working themselves out, but that never just happens when people are involved - *someone* has to take the first steps, otherwise it descends into a war of attrition. A shitty teenager who isn't at least somewhat kept in check is likely to become a shitty adult. And keeping them in check doesn't have to be ""Draconian"", just basic enforcement of respect and manners so they know what decent behaviour **is**, even if they rebel against it for a while deliberately."
"Go with your gut, this is weird as fuck. No regular guy in their early thirties is actively making friends with girls 11 yrs younger than them.

"Some amount of crudeness can be chalked up to immaturity, but this behavior has crossed that line. Doing what you can to distance yourself from them will do you some good - you cannot change your brother, so long as he's attached to the identity he's built around objectifying women. The reinforcement he's getting from his friends outweighs anything you could say or do at this point. 

You could let him know that he and his friend's behavior is the reason you are distancing yourself, but you certainly don't owe him that. These guys are days away from raping somebody, and that person certainly doesn't need to be you or your friends."

* Commented on his daughter's breasts in a sexual manner.
* Made another extreme sexual comment towards you in the past, you expressed your displeasure but this isn't enough to stop him from....
* Sexualizing your body.  

You've explained to him that you're uncomfortable.  That has not deterred him.  Do you want to continue to have this man in your life?"
"She's selfish and has to deal with the consequences of her own actions. She resisted being an adult about it, so you did what you had to do. The relationship was going to shit anyway and you definitely wouldn't have continued living together after the lease was up.

"First, please don’t make your sister get further involved in this. She did you a solid by warning you that your no-contact mother was invited to your proposal. Don’t make her into the messenger that needs to explain to your boyfriend why he shouldn’t do this. This is a discussion that you need to have with your boyfriend. If you want to give him an out, you can phrase it like maybe you think your mom was lying. “Boyfriend, I just heard from my sister that my mom is bragging about being invited to my proposal. I’m not sure what’s going on, since she tends to lie sometimes, but I just want to make 100% clear that I have no intentions of breaking no-contact with my mother. I don’t want her to be involved in any part of our lives, &amp; that includes not inviting her to our wedding, or to meet her grandchildren someday.

I'm going to guess there is *way* more going on in this relationship than just this incident.
Seems like these are two different issues. One is that he isn’t respecting your needs (to eat dinner and go to sleep at a certain time in order to wake up for work) and the second is that he is concerned about your coping mechanisms relating to this unconventional schedule.

"I would start avoiding them and your brother. If you know they are going to a party, tell your friends and all of you avoid interacting with them in anyway and be honest with anyone who asks why. 

If they harass you, file a complaint with the school. Otherwise, be clear with your brother that you won't associate with him while he associates with them. We are the company we keep. 

Why do you keep running in to them? Is it a small campus?"
"&gt;It doesn’t matter if I’m dead tired, sick, or just verbally say “I’m not in the mood”/“I don’t want to have sex.” He still wants to. Don’t get me wrong, he would never force me. But he’ll show me his boner and say he really needs it and sweet talk me until I give in.

That's coercion at best mate. Sounds like this dude doesn't respect you at all. You never have to have sex when you don't want to and if that's a dealbreaker for him so be it. "

"If I was in his situation and my bff was coming out to visit and I wanted to lounge around for a few days I’d say: I want to lounge around and order take out and catch up on Netflix, you down?  Then I’d get some wine and booze, all the snacks, and we’d lounge and catch up. I’m sure she’d be able to convince me to go out at least once. Maybe OPs relationship isn’t like that but I’d have no problem explaining to my bff about my fiancée and we laugh it off at home."
"I can say my husband did this. He told someone else he felt he settled and could get better looking. This was YEARS ago. He calls me beautiful and we have had two kids since but.... every time he gives me a compliment I think of the women from the porn he’s looking at, the women he slightly checked out getting in to her car, the women he may meet at work. I compare my body and now I compare our interest. What if they get along better etc. I have pushed him away and hurt his feelings. I don’t think we will ever be able to heal what he said to someone else and I learned. 

Please, please, please OP NEVER let your wife even think you aren’t attracted to her. Always compliment something you are attracted to. Don’t give a generic “you’re beautiful” it starts to feel empty and hallow, especially if you have your own insecurities. Say I love how you look when you think of... or I like your hair in this light. I love when we’re doing this and you laugh like that. I love how your skin feels etc. 

It sounds like you really love her. Let her know you love her. Take your time with her in areas and put her first often (if you don’t). It’ll take a while but tending to her needs will motivate her to tend to yours. It’s hard to not love someone and even become attracted in a different way that’s more than physical when you feel so cared for. Your mind will always want safe, be her safe spot and her yours. It’ll drive an internal attraction.

"Yes agreed! He’s now more sensitive to it now that I mentioned it and made it clear it made me uncomfortable.

It is a good sign. I’m really proud of him. I’m glad he didn’t make a big deal out of it and just made the necessary changes. I’m happy.

"&gt; My SO is an alcoholic - he drinks every night. 

Aaaand there it is. 

He’s hostile to your efforts to get better because they threaten his belief that no one can help *him*. If therapy (and its relatives) are useless, he has an excuse not to change or improve himself. If *you* start therapy, and it ends up helping you, he can’t hide behind that excuse anymore. And that frightens and angers him, because he’s comfortable where he is. 

(He’s also clearly scared that they’re going to tell you to leave him because he’s a sub-par partner and he knows it)

You can’t make him understand because he doesn’t *want* to understand. There is no way for you to phrase your argument in a way that will make him go “oh, you’re right, this is a great decision, good luck honey!” He’s got too much invested in his therapy-is-stupid belief and it has nothing to do with you. So stop trying to justify yourself. This is a decision in which he gets no say. Go to therapy, and use that time to reflect on whether or not you’ve outgrown this relationship. It’s generally considered a bad idea to partner with people who hold you back and drag you down. Kinda defeats the whole point of having a relationship."
That's really sweet and as long as she's not in a terrible financial situation $500 really isn't that much money for a gift especially parent to child.  I'd accept it gratefully and enjoy.
"My husband asked me to push him. I thought it was an odd question on this very romantic day we'd just had.
But none the less I pushed him, and ran away before he could push me...

However, he didn't run after me. Worried that I had hurt him, I ran back... He didn't ask me to push him. He'd used the word *épouser*, (marry/wife) and felt really sad that I had answered with a push!

So many words. And so many SOUNDS the same!"
"I would just tell your gf the reason why you didn't introduce her to them, so she knows that your issues are with them and not with her. 

Otherwise she might start thinking that you feel she's not good enough for them or something similar. "
"You're husband is an asshole. Dismissing your valid concerns because you're female is so juvenile it's making me sick. 


He regrets the wedding probably because he's unhappy right now. I'did he was happy, the money would be less of an issue. I'd suggest counselling... but you're only a year in, there's no harm in just bowing out now."
"&gt;He goes out with his friends and colleagues... but I'm not trustworthy enough to do so?

Maybe he's worried that you're doing the same thing he does when he's ""out with friends and colleagues"". 

But regardless, this all sounds *really* unhealthy and I'm not sure I could even in good conscience ecommend anything besides leaving. "
"Oh son... you better run long and fast away from that one.  If shes like that now, what do you think she will be lone in a few yrs of you allowing that to go on?"
You handle it by not reacting. You handle it by acting like the adult you are and not giving them a damn thing.
"&gt;  I don't think she should have been offended. 

Your wife called your brother in law a pedophile, and you think your sister shouldn't have been offended?  What the fuck is wrong with you?
"
"Glad to hear it was just a mistake! I have a group of friends that's scattered throughout the country, and I can 100% see something like this happening when trying to plan a reunion."
"&gt; he seems to be working from the assumption that he is generally more knowledgeable than I am. Honestly a majority of the men I've dated have been like that

You don't need to settle for men who don't respect your intelligence!

And you certainly shouldn't be with a guy who, even after you correct him, can't accept that you know more than him about *your own body*. Don't take him to an appointment to prove anything, he should be trusting you.

If you plan to stay with him you need to have a long conversation with him about respect and boundaries. Tell him that unless he is your doctor, there is no reason for him to be doubting your account of your medical history. "
"he wants all the perks of marriage and none of the work

at this point, is your life at all better with him around? "
"I don't think there would be a way to bring someone the family doesn't know into the home right now. I guess I could try to spend more time with her if that makes her feel better.

And yeah I wasn't considering telling other people, except, you know, anonymous redditors."
"&gt;But after she got home I started periodically checking her social media and as I expected she started deleted me from her social.

She's breaking up with you without breaking up with you. Scoop your dignity up and walk away from this before she just ghosts the relationship to death.

Sorry about 2 years gone, man. That sucks. "
"If you’re having these issues already at just 6 months in, I’d hazard that this relationship might be doomed. It’s fair to say that you’d be sexually incompatible but know that, in any case, no one is entitled to your body just because they have the title ‘boyfriend’. Listen to your feelings and learn to say ‘no’. "
"I know when someone is dying, loved ones often do their grieving during that period. But getting ENGAGED three months after his wife's death would be an extreme case. Even if he weren't grieving, if he was a single guy and met a woman and started dating, they would still be in the honeymoon phase at three months - even under non-grieving circumstances, they are moving too fast. It's especially too fast when you consider the children. Again, even if their mother HADN'T just died, many sources say to wait at least six months to a year to INTRODUCE your children to a new romantic partner. And three months after their mother is dead, he's essentially telling them ""Here's your new mommy!"" 

I know many responses will point out the ""he grieved while she was dying"" bit, but I think it's okay to be judgemental about a dude who is explicitly saying his new fiance is going to fill the mother role for his three-months dead wife. But being judgemental will just cause him to shut you out. So maybe suggest he talk to a therapist about how to introduce the children to his fiance, to ensure the best possible response from them (though probably futile - it sounds like he's probably already forced her on them if he's so lacking in social awareness that he's announced his engagement on FB already), or to get some ideas about how to help them adjust to their new family member while they're also still grieving. "
"They could have been more polite about it, but yeah...tanning ages you. The more you do it, the faster the aging effects happen.  If looking youthful is a big concern, tanning is the opposite of what you should do."
"I don't think you fully appreciate how remarkable it is that you were able to break the habit of shame and secrecy, change the way you saw and evaluated his behavior, and get the hell out of Dodge, within 4 months of that original post.  You are a truly remarkable person.  What determines where we end up in life is not where we start out, but whether we can change.  You have the ability to listen and change, and it will take you very, very far.  Congratulations and best wishes to you.  Thanks so much for sharing this lovely follow up here."
He's sexually harassing you. Perhaps you should look for a new living arrangement. 
"I'm the type that believes firmly it's possible to have a totally platonic relationship with an ex. HOWEVER, that isn't your issue here. Your issue is that your boyfriend lied to you repeatedly about speaking to his ex-wife after saying he wouldn't and sent inappropriate messages to another woman he dated. That is boundary-breaking regardless of how you feel about exes.

Don't break up with him because you have different views on this matter, break up with him because he has proven himself to be untrustworthy.

&gt; If he were anyone else I would have left already but I've loved him for a long time and I want it to work out so badly

Love isn't enough. You also need trust, which he is not providing you. What do you think talking to him again will accomplish when you've already been crystal clear about your boundaries and he has violated them multiple times?"
"I just wanted to point out that if you guys are having sex, you're at high risk for an infection. All of that bacteria is not quarantined to his ass, especially if it gets sweaty."
That is really sweet post. :)
"The fact that he likes to be around children is tied to his job. There's nothing inherently sexual or weird about that, you and your wife are the ones creating that storyline.

Your daughter is 6, which means she's going to want to start spending time at friend's houses without her parents needing to be present. The fact that your children are homeschooled makes it seem like your wife doesn't want any other adults present in their lives without you being there.

While this is understandable for babies and younger children, it's going to rapidly become a big problem for your family as your kids get older.

I would recommend your wife talking to a professional about this hang up now rather than in a few years when your daughter is going to want to socialize regularly with other children."
"Set a filter so her emails go unread to a special folder that you only look at when you feel strong enough, or else have a friend skim in order to let you know the gist of what's up.

"I mistakenly assumed her friend was single. Like, clearly this woman is single—how else do you decorate your home in teeny bopper stuff and have a SO?  Then OP drops that Stella has a *husband*. Wait, what?"
"Your mistake was saying that you still love and will be there for her when what you really meant was you didn’t want the friendship anymore. I don’t think you’ve been at all clear about where you see this friendship going. We are also left wondering what you said that kicked this whole thing off. If it was a criticism as you say then how is it that she misunderstood? And how did you lose your temper more than once in the short time you stayed? 

If you don’t want a friendship, make that clear and walk away. "
"You are not being unfair. You and your girlfriend have different ideas of what a relaxing day off looks like, and you need the rest. Would you be willing to do a week-on/week-off situation where every other week you get your ""sleep all day and do nothing day"" and on the alternating week, she gets her ""romantic outing day""? And maybe the romantic outings don't start until after 11 so you can sleep in a bit. "
"I've never considered that...When she hurts though, I hate it, and I hurt. If her day is ruined, I feel like my day is ruined. So that mirroring may be happening here."
"Jesus, she talks to your 2 year old about fucking rape and sex? Good freaking god what a batshit crazy person."
"Tell your friend exactly what you want to do—lounge around the house and basically do nothing. Your friend should hopefully be willing to hang out and just let you do your thing. You can get TV show choice to binge or whatever you want to do, or you can play your video game and he can watch as an audience (and handle ordering food, or whatever).

If he wants to do one thing out in your area, consider (but no need to agree) to do that one thing (hopefully it's not more than a few-hour venture or less to visit that one thing or whatever). Your friend also can hop out and do that on his own while you continue to lounge around the house.

Hopefully that works for you."
"I mean...what even was the joke here? ""I'm pretending you're an underage girl while we have sex"" isn't even edgy humor, it's just a weird, creepy statement.

&gt; I just broadly told him when we met that I was living with someone with pedophilic tendencies in the past and that it was very fucked up

Given the fact that he knew about this, I feel a bit less forgiving. When you know someone has a specific trauma, even in broad terms, you take care to be sensitive about that particular subject. If you want to give him another chance I'd watch very carefully to make sure he has actually learned a lesson from this.

Honestly, I'd find a 34-year-old with edgelord humor to be a huge turn-off in general, as usually that's a glaring sign of immaturity and lack of social grace. I love dark humor, but dark humor that's actually funny is smart. Being ""edgy"" is often just lazy."
"Speaking as a recovering alcoholic, y'all are exactly right."
"""or point to my stomach and say, ""what is this."" 

""This is your ex girlfriend's stomach. Now observe your ex girlfriend's ass as she walks out of your life forever.""

"A couple things: 

My mother had three kids. She's divorced and none of us live with her. While we have ""okay"" relationships with her, it's more ""cordial"" than close. While you're not in the same boat, my point is, children are not a guarantee that they'll be there, filling the role of ""physical reminder/piece of my late husband"". 

They could have passed away too. 

They could be criminals or other people you want nothing to do with. 

They could be friendly, but distant people in your lives. 

They could be constant drama and heartache rather than a reassurance.

They could have been severely disabled, requiring intense round the clock care and millions of dollars in medical bills, and completely unable to provide you with companionship or help in your older age. 

They could be people who are making choices that you strongly disagree with and are a source of pain and confusion rather than strength and confidence. 

And this would 100% prevent them from being around in your older age to give you companionship for any of these reasons, let alone being a welcome reminder of your late husband. 

Aside from all that...

If you want people around you in older age, it's never too late to start making friends. Or getting back in touch with family. Start talking to cousins and in laws. Start attending church or a gathering. Start doing hobbies and interests and sports. "
"RUN. Seriously, run. This guy is terrifying and you need to get out of this and go to the school you want to go to. And then call his parents and tell them that he is demonstrating suicidal tendencies and needs assistance right the fuck now. 

You do not stay with someone who threatens your life. That is not love. "
"&gt;She likely gets more tips by being involved with the kids and might even think she's helping.

Yes. I'm sure she likes babies, but she also probably gets tipped extra for being good with kids, and some people appreciate the extra help entertaining the baby; she probably thinks that by interacting with your baby, she's giving you a chance to eat without having to worry about it."
"&gt;My SO is an alcoholic - he drinks every night. One comment that he said to me was, “If you see a therapist, they’re going to ask about me and they’re going to know I’m an “alcoholic.” Then they’re just going to judge me and blame your depression on me.” 

Your boyfriend is afraid your therapist will help you realize that you don't have to be in a relationship with an alcoholic."
"This is your gut speaking to you and I’m one of the people who believe that you should listen to your gut. The fact that he has NEVER taken the dog for a walk is what sticks out,it’s your dog and the expense of having it is yours but he has never taken the dog out?
How do you manage with your other finances is he very careful not to spend more than you?"
This was so beautiful. I'm so glad you are finally able to heal and embrace your beauty :) it's a hard thing to do
"&gt; Any advice please, on what to do?

Make a public statement where you call people (no one specific, in general) out on their bs behaviour. If it's possible, give an interview.

Furthermore, go and visit your opponent in the hospital. Bring a little something and tell him how much you enjoyed the fight with him and that you're sorry that people use this fight for openly showing their racist thoughts."
"I'd just start giving them a consequence for their actions: ditch them. Stop picking up the phone when they call. Be busy when they ask you over for dinner. Tell them your social calendar is already full with people who don't treat you like shit. Some people are just fundamentally assholes, and all you can do is be around them less. "
"Yeah, this guy sounds incredibly creepy. It’s not your imagination!

You need to decide what your boundaries are, and hold fast to them. People like this are unpredictable. After you put your foot down, he might just give up and move on to his next target, or he might become vindictive. Please let someone know what he’s doing. "
"I can understand why you might have been hurt, but I can also understand his side as well. Unless I'm reading this wrong, he scribbled up a picture of you as well as a picture of himself so that alone tells me it wasn't the most serious of actions in his mind. Also, the fact that he gave you one of him to throw axes at too. Since you mentioned you have been having trouble in your relationship, I could see this as a kind of way to work out your frustrations with each other. "
Go to the DCFS. Eventually this will affect your sisters too.
Get a dogsitter to come and walk the dogs when you can't make it back.
Exactly. It sounds like he's trying to groom OP by pushing boundaries. Remember kids: just say no.
At minimum he should have *asked* you before he went and did this. It's beyond inappropriate.
"&gt;  a really nice guy

No, no he isn't. He is, however, a Nice Guy, who has been inserting Kindness Tokens into the relationship in the hopes that you will reward him with sex, and since you have not done so he is now escalating his behaviors. Can you get out of there anytime soon? And lock your door at all times. And don't let him fix you any drinks. And maybe look into the legality of pepper spray."
"I am not a mother and I never will be because I’d be a terrible, selfish parent but this got me. 

It is so true! It’s so beautiful put. Being pregnant isn’t just “yay!!! Baby!!!” A woman’s body goes through a lot while pregnant! Many at risk for complications that they fight for the sake of their child."
"&gt;He has about US$2000 limit left on one of his cards; a flight back to the US is about US$1000. Do I tell him to book a flight and fuck off? 

YES.  This isn't going to get better.  It's gotten worse over time.  It would not be a surprise to discover he has yet more hidden debt.

&gt;Or do I work it out? This is the man (child?) I thought I would marry.

You **can't** ""work it out"" because that requires his cooperation.  

He's lied to you, increased his debt, and doesnt seem to understand  how finances work.

His mother supported him when she was alive. Now you are supporting him.

He needs to learn how to support himself.

You would be insane to marry someone who is so irresponsible and so fucking clueless about the insanity of running up massive credit card debt.

Then don't make it 9.  
"Don't let their narrative get into your head.  You turned down Lupe because you don't want to the responsibility of having a baby in the house, end of story.      Having a child is a tremendous responsibility, and having the responsibility when it's not your child is awful.    You'll be the built in baby sitter, errand runner, back-up mom, no parties, no friends over, you place will need to be child proofed, gates everywhere, plugs in the electrical outlets, covers on the door knobs.  

You were getting played from the start.  Good schools?  The child won't be going to school for 5 more years, she was already planning on living with you permanently.  

If you try to ""make it up"" to Lupe your family will turn your ""good deed"" into proof that you knew you did something wrong, otherwise you wouldn't need to ""make it up"" to Lupe.    

Tell her that you have no interest in living with a child.  Don't defend yourself, don't argue, don't justify, just say that you don't want the responsibility of a child, then stop talking.  
  "
"I think that what you want to do is the right thing to do. You don’t have to tell them everything, you can just say “We separated, the children are with me, here’s her new contact number and I’d like to maintain a good relationship with you because I want you in the kids lives” and leave it at that. Good luck OP "
"I dated someone for 3 years who was going down this path. I ended up completely supporting us both by working crazy hours and barely scraping by and the whole time he was too busy to clean up around the house because he was “training” ie playing video games. 

I ended up resenting him and grew to hate him because of it. It’s not fair for him to follow his dreams while you’re stuck with the reality of bills and real life.

"&gt;things just working themselves out

OP seems so hands off in his own life. Makes me wonder if it was part of the reason his first wife divorced him. I wouldn't be able to stand this and I'm definitely not ""Draconian""."
"I am chronically ill and was bedridden for a year during a terrible flare, I may be able to provide some insight. Losing your health and living in isolation is a huge mindfuck and it messes with your head pretty hardcore. When I was laying in bed dying, I longed for things that could make me feel normal and remind me what it was like to feel joy or excitement- a break from the sadness and pain, the despair. For me it was wanting to take my kids to the park or go out for a drink with my friends. Obviously wanting a kiss from her cousin is not appropriate, but I imagine that she wants to feel something pleasant and she’s not in a position to see other boys/men to try to get that. I feel for her. Thanks for visiting her, it’s so important. Please don’t let this alienate you from your cousin, maybe you can come up with something else that stirs up pleasant memories or feelings like a board game or a funny movie. "
"You just tell her. She’s not a child, and she makes her own money. At this point she’s just a greedy mooch. 
Let her awkwardly sit without a drink or wait in the car while you go in to yoga. Eventually she’ll figure out that if she wants to enjoy her time with you, it’s on her to pay for it. "
"&gt; uncle doesn't want to take care of Lupe and her baby

They probably figured 25 year old OP would be the perfect babysitter for her cousin's kid too.  "
"If I were OP I would also check that the roommate is actually paying the rent...

If she cant cover utilities she might also not be paying rent. I had someone do that to me. Only found out when we got evicted that he had been spending the £650 I was giving him a month and not giving it to the landlord."
Even saying nothing says something
"I had a similar situation where my Mum was constantly bringing up my ex and mentioning each time she saw her.


I understand you've spoken to your parents but I'd give it one more attempt. Put emphasis on how it makes you feel, how the relationship ended and the fact you have absolutely no intention of rekindling anything with your ex.


If they don't stop after the second conversation then I'd go and stay with your friend and let you parents know why."
"People who stare are rude, full stop. I am always so shocked by these posts because there are so many rude, lecherous, gross men who try to justify it by saying that they can't help it, or that women don't notice them do it. Did none of these men have parents????? ""Staring at strangers is rude"" is an extremely basic lesson to learn about living in a society. I'd bring it up one more time and say, ""You know how you told me that you don't stare at women anymore? You do, and it's very overt and obvious, and it makes me uncomfortable. It's rude and it's disrespectful to me and to them."" There are decent men out there so I'd find one of them to date instead if he can't grow up. "
"This is intentional. Do not believe for a moment that it isn’t. 

It’s the work of an abuser. It’s insidious. Little jabs. Consistent but minor enough that you’re doubting his intent. Don’t; he’s playing a long game. You feel ugly. And his goal is that your insecurity turns to gratitude that he stays with you. It’s a power thing. And it’s gross. 

“I really want us to be a strong couple with a great marriage. You make a lot of comments about my appearance that are not kind or considerate. They aren’t things I would say to you. Do you want some examples or do you know what I’m referring to?” 

He will likely react poorly. You’ll probably hear things like “oh so I can’t say anything to you” etc. and you need to stay calm and decisive: “No, that’s not what I said. Suggesting I shop in the plus sizes, asking what I did to my hair without it being a compliment, sharing an observation that my nose is wife. These aren’t thinks you say to other women in your life. I’m asking you to afford me the same consideration.  Most of your comments are unnecessary and unkind and I’m worried if you think it will be hard to stop.” 

Counseling OP. This is poor character on his part and there is intent."
"&gt; Recently, he has decided he wants to essentially start a training place of his own.

What does this mean exactly? Is he interested in purchasing a franchise of an existing brand or in creating his own brand entirely? Has he figured out the start up costs for everything he would need (equipment, building out the locker facilities, computers &amp; business software, etc)? Also, does he have a good handle of his responsibilities as owner? Because I think it’s extremely concerning if he didn’t enjoy a management role but wants to own a business. As owner, he will need to wear lots of hats &amp; do lots of jobs besides being a trainer. And does he have a realistic grasp on clients? People tend to get into routines at the gym, so I’m not confident that people would cancel their existing memberships &amp; transfer to a different location to follow a specific trainer, unless he has something very specific &amp; special. I think when a spouse wants to start their own business, it’s reasonable for the other spouse to expect a business plan of some sort detailing start up costs, how long it’ll take to be profitable, etc. Yes, you should support your partner’s dreams, but your partner should be able to demonstrate that he has a plan &amp; wont bankrupt you both with a pipe dream. 

Separately, I think you need to deal with your incompatibility when it comes to career. I share similar views about a partner working fixed hours for a fixed salary, so I understand where you’re coming from. But you know that your partner does not want a 9-5, so insisting that he change his own values to get one isn’t going to work. Regardless of whether or not he starts this business, he’s not ever going to be a 9-5 person, so you need to think through that also. "
"This is kind of what I assumed would happen - that everyone would just be accepting that it were legal and family would exhibit polite smoking etiquette (they do already; not worried about this).

But, fiance brought it up specifically and said that he wanted me to tell everyone not to smoke any cannabis at the wedding.

So here we are."
I think so too.  The first warm moonless night the OP needs to take her out there and have some fun.  I wonder if this is her way of telling the OP that their sex life could use a little spark?

One of several things will happen: a.] once you get into your late 20's he'll find someone younger and go after another teenager, or b.] once you mature (Oh, he's not dating you because you're ""sooo mature for your age,"") you'll realize that you have nothing in  common with a predatory 50 year old. 

Have some self-respect! He's only talking to you because he wants you to terminate. He won't get a divorce next year, and once you terminate he'll stop talking to you again. Decide if you're ready for this kid and if you want it. If you do, be prepared to raise this kid alone and fight like hell for child support.

"*Because I think it’s extremely concerning if he didn’t enjoy a management role but wants to own a business.*

Yeah, this stuck out to me, too. As an owner he likely will be doing mostly overhead work and less actual training.

"It sounds like your boyfriend doesn't understand how...anything works. Does he have a job? Does he understand how employment works?

I think I'd, one more time, say ""It was a temp job. It ended. That's what they do. I don't want to talk about this with you anymore, and if you bring it up again I will end the conversation."" And then *do that*. If he brings it up again, hang up the phone, leave the room, tell him to get out, get in the car and drive away."
"Uh... look, I think if you married someone you didn't really know well, then you kinda put yourself in the position for a bomb like this to get dropped on you.  Now that you know, you have to explore the issue and decide if this is a deal-breaker and you need to split up.  I mean, if philosophical differences in belief were important to you why didn't you figure that out before you were married?

Anyway, I think having a sincere belief that aliens live inside the moon is weird but relatively harmless.  It's not like this means she has to send thousands of dollars to some weird conspiracy theorist or something.  But you might also want to ask what other strange things she might believe.  Like, is she anti-vax?  I'd be more worried about something like that.  "

I think you've summed up how I feel but I'm always afraid that maybe I just don't understand Asperger's. My family make it sound like he is justified.

There is absolutely nothing you can do, nothing you can say to her that will change her opinion about this right now. If you try to reason with her, it will just turn into an argument and not go well. That letter was incredibly toxic, and shows zero growth on her part. 

The part about her saying the first therapist was too immature is concerning, that therapist was actually probably doing the right thing and trying to get her to see thi gs from your side a bit, but she wasn't having it.

I am truly sorry that you are in this situation right now but you have so much potential to grow and be successful in life, don't let her take that away. You can do this.

"I stopped reading after you said he runs over cats for points.

Your ex husband is a real POS and your sister is crazy.

You need to sit her down and tell her everything. Maybe tell the rest of your family too and get them on board. Your ex is am awful human being who deserves to die alone."
"I’m so sorry for your loss.

I’m gonna give your bf the benefit of the doubt here - it doesn’t sound like he was being intentionally obtuse. Grief makes people awkward and they don’t always know how to react. He tried to say the things people usually say and this made you ‘furious’ (a little unfair on him). He tried cheering you up by tagging you in memes, you obviously considered this a bother, but from his point of view he just wanted to make you feel better and obviously thought this would work. My friend sent me memes the day my pet died and it was the only thing all day that made me smile, so it’s a YMMV situation I guess.

After you told him to stop with the memes, he listened, and did. His silence the next day is obviously him still not knowing what to say, but he reached out and let you know he would be there for you - again, you react with anger. He can’t win.

I know everyone reacts differently to grief but please don’t take it out on him. He sounds sweet and well meaning. If his attempts are annoying you right now maybe just have a word with him telling him what you need, whether that’s space, or a cuddle, or him fetching groceries for your family or something."

"The best I’ve been able to come up w in my own life (my own dad did this, he’s dead now) is this: **”So, what’s the punchline?”**

If it’s a joke then they should be able to explain it - pretend like you don’t get it. Force them to explain in detail exactly what it is that they’re laughing it. 

This should do one of two things:

1) Make them actually say the shitty thing out loud and be plainly exposed as being the asshole that they truly are and force the spotlight on that behavior

Or 

2) Make them backtrack, hem&amp;haw over whether you ‘have a sense of humor’, deflect and avoid answering - in which case you play more and more dumb/innocent in just wanting to understand the ‘joke’ (i.e., “I like jokes! I wanna laugh, too! :)”"
It sounds like you don't like her. (I don't blame she sounds boring and horrifying in turns) Don't be friends with people you don't like. It's exhausting.
"If the ring has no significance, like being a family heirloom, return it and get her a ring she wants. Maybe he’s embarrassed that he made the wrong call and just needs time to accept it. There’s nothing wrong with both partners going ring shopping together. "
"&gt; I don't know where I stand on that and I hope we don't have to go there.

Do you know where you stand on anything, or do you just generally go with whatever you think is going to prevent a conflict with your wife?

I don't believe that you can't see how this is disrespectful towards your sister and her husband, and how can you be suprised that it ""goes both ways.""

Was your wife sexually abused by a non family member??? "
"&gt; She has gotten many official complaints 

Which means that you will not be seen as a troublemaker.  

Sit down and document her most recent rant as objectively as you can -- length or tirade, specific unwarranted, complaints, etc. and email it to yourself.    Then get a Voice Activated Recorder and keep it with you.   The next time she goes off.  Take the recording and your report to HR.   Explain that you decided to record her because you didn't think anyone would believe how extreme her behavior has been.    With irrefutable proof, HR will have to do something about her."
"You have only been together for two months - and he belittles and mistrusts you already. In your shoes, I would cut my losses and leave.  
  
More concerning is the fact that you have convinced yourself that it is OK and normal for a guy to assume that he always knows more than you about any given subject. Set your standards a bit higher, and start choosing men who will respect you as an equal."
"Your sister is not being 'petty' to form resentment against this. Without actually saying it, your wife is implying your brother-in-law has the potential to be a child abuser. Either physically or sexually. 

I would be fucking pissed if my brother's wife said such an unfounded thing against my husband. You are really, really, really, belittling your sister's (and your BIL's) feelings here. 

The only people your wife is truly hurting are you, her, and your kids and their future relationships with cousins, uncles, family, etc. 

The approach isn't to tell kids everyone wants to molest them. What I would do is instill a sense of trust in my kids and let them know (and show) that they can tell me anything. Even if they are scared. Even if they don't want to. I would forge and cultivate a 'safe place' so to speak for kids via patience, understanding, and truly listening.

As a former over thinker, this type of overthinking and over-rationalising other's bad behaviour is detrimental to your recovery from anxiety. 

You need to have this conversation. Ideally face to face is best but as you have anxiety then maybe send her a text ""Hey friend, when I give you my portion of the rent, I am subtracting what you owe me."""

""X is welcome to talk to me about this himself."" Etc.  Y'all GROWN.  triangulating like this is some mean girls nonsense.

"It really depends on the tone of the group.  If my close colleagues were making jokes about my lifestyle, I'd turn it right back on em.  

They joke about me being boring?  I'll let em know I'll save a piece of my liver for them when they party themselves to death.

They mock the institution of marriage and my wife?  I'll joke about their parent's shitty marriage setting a horrible example.

I'm in a similar situation to you and I just lean hard into the old man jokes.  I own that shit because I am 100% completely fine with my lifestyle and others opinions of it have no baring on the enjoyment I get from it.  Own it then dish it.

"What the actual fuck is wrong with your bf!? OP you need to reconsider marrying this man until he *completely understands* that your mother was abusive and that you want nothing to do with her. 

His actions present several problems: he either doesn’t believe you about the abuse or doesn’t take it and its effects on you seriously and he has decided to take it upon himself to make a HUGE decision for you- ending NC with your mother which shows a serious lack of respect. Even if he apologizes, would you be able to trust that he won’t try to bring your mother into your life for other life events?

Talk to him now. Show him the screenshots. Perhaps some couples therapy would be a good idea. Personally this would be a dealbreaker for me though. I’m not sure I’d be able to trust him after this."
"Yikes OP.

I think your fear and frustration are completely valid here, I just don't see a way of getting it through to your brother.

His response to his BIL was disgusting. 

How old are your nieces and nephews? I would be prepared to offer them support if they need it. Even if they are only toddlers this is going to be hard on them. "
It's Harry.
"Except that he seems to be happily mooching off you while he doesn't work?  And somehow views that as his ""right""?

What he did was theft.  It was appallingly cold and utterly wrong. "
"So at first I was thinking, ""WTF is she complaining about, she's the one who wanted the dog!"" Like obviously you can't resent him too much, he never wanted the responsibility of having a pet. 

...until I realized that literally right now, I'm sick with a cold. A neighbor friend of mine (that I also work with) texted asking if I needed her to walk my pup for me. It's not her dog, but she cares about me, and knows that this small thing will make my afternoon easier. 

While, yeah, it's YOUR dog, okay, I get that - it's also bizarre to me that during times where you're feeling stressed, overwhelmed, busy, or sick, he doesn't ever offer to help out. That's just being a good partner. I have friends that do more for me. I can think of many instances where I was overwhelmed or stressed or sick and the close people around me instantly, without prompting, tried to show their love through helping me out with things that were absolutely not their responsibility. Just because. Just because they loved me.

A partner should do the same. Can you count on him? Does he rise to the occasion in other ways to help you out when you need it? When you're stressed/busy/overworked/sick, does he do things for you to help make your life easier? 

It's not about obligation. He isn't obligated to take care of this dog. But damn, if you can't rely on your partner to help you out when you need it.... that's a problem. "
"I hate this societal pressure on men, and I hate it more when they bow to it instead of *listening to the person they want to marry*. Poor OP, she was explicit about her wants and he ignored them.

I’ve made it very clear to my bf that should be propose in the future I would not want (and given my clumsiness would frankly be scared to wear) an expensive ring. Most of what I own is cheaper costume jewellery and I like it that way - that’s me. Yet he’s given me several hints since that this info has bounced off him like water off a duck’s back and he plans to spend lots on a ring. It’s frustrating. I don’t need him to bankrupt himself to show that he cares.

"There was a popular post on here where a grandparent or parent was asking for current slang terms to use ironically on their kids to embarrass them, but to be honest, kids love it and think it's fun. 

Don't stress too much about what you can do with her and just be there and talk to her. Text her memes and gifs back. Kids these days can have a whole conversation on just gifs and memes. And use some current slang to throw her off and get a laugh out of her.

Some phrases/slang my friends and I like to use:

""Mood."" Or ""That is a whole mood."" This loosely means ""I get how you feel"" or ""I feel the same way."" 

&gt;Granddaughter: I was halfway through straightening my hair and hated it so I faked sick and stayed home.  
&gt;  
&gt;Grandpa: Mood.

""You're being extra."" This means ""You're doing too much"" or ""You're being over-the-top."" Meant as a slight dig.

&gt;Granddaughter: \*Goes out wearing a french beret\*  
&gt;  
&gt;Grandpa: You're looking extra right now, but it kinda works.

""Flexing"" means showing off kind of in a subtle way.

&gt;Granddaughter: Grandpa, your pot roast was delicious.  
&gt;  
&gt;Grandpa: Thank you, sweetheart. I'm trying to flex on your grandma."

"Can you try starting a general conversation about finances and career goals, just based on the fact that you know he only has part-time gigs so logically should not be trying to keep up with you in spending?  Maybe he will come clean about some of this and give you the opportunity to ask a bunch of questions and get him to devulge this story, which will solve the problem of not being able to tell him what you found in his email.  Or maybe he'll double down on outlandish lies, which will solve the problem of confirming for you that you should break up with him without even bothering to try to address what you found."
"OP, you are not wrong to decline to let your ex friend have another opportunity to dump on you.

"He needs to respect your boundaries. If you don't want to have sex, you shouldn't have to. 

I don't always feel like having sex when my husband does. But I'll do it most of the time because I love him and I want him to be satisfied sexually. The difference is, I don't feel used - this is because my husband respects my boundaries. He doesn't push me or whip his penis out and beg me. 

Tell him how you feel. He sounds selfish and disconnected from your feelings.

"I think you said that very tactfully.

So he has a fetish for touching other women who might not know why they were chosen for this ""discount"". He's doing it to get his rocks off.

Hopefully neither, because you can't cure either. You deserve better."
"This might be unpopular, but I’m going to say it anyway.

You sound like the ultimate type B. You couldn’t see the trouble in your first marriage, and you seem to be avoiding the real issues in this one. So rather than addressing them, you are bolting.

Look, your step-wife should not be disciplining your children. Because YOU should. There is a huge gap between strict and free-range parenting, and your style isn’t any better than hers. Yeah, you get to be the “good guy,” which is fun. But your daughter doesn’t respect your wife and used the living situation as leverage to get you to do what she wants. And you let this happen.

Do you have a custody agreement? Because your daughter can’t just up and leave because she doesn’t like the new step-mom. If you have split custody from the courts, you are legally entitled to having custody for a specific length of time. So she left because YOU want to avoid conflict and actually do something.

I can’t say much about your new wife, since this post is fairly skewed. She is obviously frustrated by your lack of parenting and is trying to compensate, which perhaps isn’t appropriate. But she is your wife, and she is now helping to raise your children. You cannot treat her like an outsider. You need to co-parent both with your ex and your wife.

And yeah, your ex talks poorly about your wife. That isn’t appropriate. I’m betting the kids aren’t “accidentally” overheating things. She also needs to respect your new marriage."
"You need to stop beating around the bush and just be completely honest, OP. I think communication will fix the issue you are having."
"It's really normal for women to not have flat stomachs and to have their bodies look and feel different as they age, especially after pregnancy. I used to work as a sports coach with a bunch of women who had had children, and in the break room they would explain to the younger female employees what pregnancy does to you, and show us their stomachs and thighs with stretch marks and loose skin. We don't see images of this very often unless we're surrounded by close female friends or relatives who are open about it. But I think a lot of feeling confident and attractive or attracted to someone is just seeing the wide range of how bodies look and understanding that yours is one of many, many variations that aren't ""better"" or ""worse"" than others.

I'm not really sure how to cultivate this if it doesn't exist around you, but you may be able to find some information and images online. I know that some people feel this too at exercise classes where many people who aren't all 22 and super-fit attend. Like yoga classes where the crowd is full of people at different ages or ability levels."

This is just something that happens to kids pretty frequently. It's not like you did something or didn't do something that caused it. Kids have small eustachian tubes that don't drain as well as adults. It happens.

All that said, your wife's neglect of a sick child (and of herself when she is ill) sounds like classic avoidance born of a phobia or a past trauma. Being afraid of doctors or illness is a very serious thing that needs to be addressed. Your wife needs to go see a therapist if she's unable to adequately care for her own child when they are sick.

Is your son fully vaccinated? Has he had comprehensive health care to this point in his life?

" She's being abusive, you're in an abusive relationship. She's controlling you through threats to you and herself and that's not ok. Are you able to text her, tell her to never contact you again and block her on everything? After that if she shows up at your apartment tell her that you will call the police for trespassing. Tell your work that someone has been threatening you/stalking you if she shows up there. This isn't normal behavior and you have absolutely not responsible for her actions. She is deeply mentally ill and needs treatment from professionals. 

&amp;#x200B;

"I remember sitting in my parents house and my brother comes home texting away on his phone. This is unusual for my brother because he rarely uses his phone unless talking. My mother jokes with him about his sudden interest. We paid it no mind

A few days later my brother is laughing hysterically and my mother looks and notices he’s laughing from something in google translator. She doesn’t say anything and instead just observe. I suddenly hear her ask him “you’re texting someone and using google translator?”
He starts explaining how he met this girl and she doesn’t speak English but they use google translator to talk to each other. He send her a message in English and she translates in to Spanish and vice versa.My mother and I found this hilarious. 

6 years later and they are still in a relationship. I listen to him speak to her in Spanish sometimes and I have conversations with her as if I’m speaking to any other English native. I’m proud of them. They found an interest in each other and continued their relationship.

"Kids is one of those things that’s a definite relationship dealbreaker. If you’re certain neither one of you will change your stance regarding this issue, then I’d break up now and get it over with so you can both find someone more compatible."

"He owes you money. It's not 'ours', this was a specific gift left to you. You could've chosen to book a vacation for you two as a couple, or pay off personal debt or take Karen along for something fun. The point is that you were the decider, not him.

You should get all the financial info and put it on the table literally. What does Jack bring in? What is he paying in your household? How much have you comingled? It might've made sense that he didn't view it as yours specifically if this is behaviour you've condoned for years. Look at the numbers. It sounds like you've financially invested a lot more in this relationship than he has. Grief can make you do 'irrational' things, but it can also expose what you've been blinded by for a long time. Maybe that's happening? 

Take your time. Do your research. Figure out what you've been accepting that you don't really want now anymore. Then see what you can and should change for you to do better. You don't have to break up today, but you don't have to accept what he did either. "

"I'm calling bullshit. I've gotten drunk with my boyfriend dozens of times and he's never 1) violated a sexual boundary that I've explicitly upheld multiple times, or 2) documented it and moved it to a specific folder so he could revisit it later

Your boyfriend is only sorry he got caught after he documented himself violating you sexually while you were unconscious and could not consent. He took pictures so he could relive it later. This was not a ""drunken mistake"", he purposefully hid this from you and hoped you would never find out.

Can you ever trust that he'll behave himself and respect your boundaries when you're drunk/unconscious ever again? I know I wouldn't. 


I know you mentioned that you are sometimes finding yourself getting turned on when you think about those pictures; but it's still concerning that he is blaming intoxication for his actions and refusing to take personal responsibility. These sexual discoveries should be pursued with consent every step of the way, and it is wrong that he just did this anyway when you had no choice or chance to stop it."
"Divorces nearly never come ""out of the blue"". For every person I hear say that, there's a partner who tried to talk to them multiple times and communicate what was going wrong and how unhappy they were. It's a pattern that really gets noticable once the first round of divorces happens in your friends group. 

I told my exhusband for 18 months that I would have to divorce him if things did not change and I spelled it out, step by step. So many tears, fights, etc. Then, of course, when I asked him for a divorce he was *shocked* that something like that could ""come out of the blue"". "

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; but he insists on joining me and I don't want to hurt his feelings by asking him to hang back.  

But he's hurting your feelings by ignoring your wishes and acting like your shadow. Why is he allowed to do this but you're not allowed to be honest and upfront?

The only way it will get through to him is if you are blunt and up front. Tell him you need to address this now and work on it before it drives you to the edge because this will be what break you two apart months, years down the line."

Anyway, my approach would be to see what the fiancé thinks is the worst outcome of a joint or two being passed around."
"&gt;I honestly want to tell my boyfriend to replace the stuff he threw out with his own money because it was his idea to dump it all. But I don't know if that'd be unfair because we did talk about buying things together.

For this part of your problem, how about you just come up with a dollar amount you're willing to spend on new stuff. Don't think of it as ""replacing"" stuff, just pitch it as ""I've budged $XXX to spend on furnishings, how about you?"" Or you still get each other's input on how to furnish, but you don't buy ""together"" (so you don't each own half a sofa, half a table, etc), and instead you buy a table and lamp, he buys a sofa, etc."

"I've tried. It's hard to teach an old dog new tricks, you know. We went to her village on the other side of the planet for the holidays in December. Her 11 year old niece, who is doing great with her English, sat next to me on the porch one day.

""Tito (uncle) I have a project""

""A project? What is it?""

I'd break up with someone for pulling that. Maybe it's harsh, but the moment someone brushes aside my legitimate feelings and concerns and blames it on my period is the day I'd be done with them. 

I see a recurring pattern of disrespectful comments, passive aggressiveness, and overall lack of respect from your husband. I wouldn't put up with it.

If you are hell-bent on staying together even though you are with someone who doesn't care about your understandable requests for financial privacy, you will need couples therapy. The break down in communication and respect is huge."

"That is a great idea about talking about my beliefs now.

Being in a relationship that's deceitful in any way, like cheating, or hiding from people, is wrong to everyone involved.

Because that's what I believe now, and I don't look back on what I did for money as anything positive or healthy."
This is going to be really hard on them! I recommend focusing on them rather than your brother. 
You guys are in a horrible wreck of a relationship. Your conversation with a *cashier* should not be threatening. 
"Well, it wasn't an accident. Don't bring that up, though. Just tell him you have always wanted to try ass play and want to know if he is interested."

"Ah, a man who thinks it requires a vagina to operate household appliances. You don’t owe him an explanation for why you’re not his cleaning lady. Don’t JADE (justify, argue, defend or explain). “In my limited spare time I’m going to relax and maybe spend some quality time with my kids, not doing your housework. I’ll be glad to look around for a housekeeper you can hire, if you’d like”.  Then refuse to discuss it again."
This is actually what I’ve been thinking. He wants the cook and maid and nanny. Not the wife. Thank you. 
i'm sorry but i'm dying at the thought that in your husband's mind he had just asked about marriage and your response was to push him and run away
"&gt;&gt;Am I being a hag because I don’t want to do his laundry?

You're not his valet, but he's treating you like one, isn't he? Stop doing it: ""Sorry, darling, I only have a second to pick up x thing at your house. No time to put a load in!"""
Actions always mean more than words. Time for you to call a divorce lawyer. You don't need him to file - you can do it.
"Document, Film and Report. No place for this person if shes going to make it a hostile workplace. She sounds like a Karen to me."
"People in this thread seem to be glossing over one particularly important point... **his fucking mom and sister died in the very recent past**

This is all probably very overwhelming for him.. he may not know whether he even has the emotional strength to start something with you at this point and he’s trying to work that out in his mind.. he’s probably feeling guilty for having gone so far with you when he may not be in the right emotional state at this time in his life

I can imagine how bad this sucks for you, really I do, I’m going through something similar enough that I definitely get it.. you’ve already texted him 3 times so take some time to consider whether you wanna text him a 4th (personally idgaf so I’d probably do it but I typically make rash decisions that work out sometimes and don’t work out other times).. if you do text him again though, it shouldn’t be about how you enjoyed the time you spent together but rather something about how you really empathize with him, how you felt his pain and even though you guys are new, you just want to be there for him.. cuz that’s probably the best bet you have at this point to let him know how you feel about him imo.. it’s a shitty situation, but it sounds like you like him and you’re a good person who cares so I hope it works out for you guys"
"This is me and my partner as well! One of my favourite stories is when I brought back cheese from Wales, not knowing Wales is Galle in French - my partner thought I had brought him cheese from *whales* and was really confused how you would milk one."
"Stop letting this woman mistreat you like this in your own fucking house. She yells at you, you yell back. You tell her you will not be disrespected in YOUR home. As for your husband, I’d be beyond disgusted at his complete failure to be on your side. He is failing you as a husband. Tell him that if he doesn’t make his mother behave and respect you during your stay, you’re taking the baby and going to stay at your own parents place for a while. Then fucking follow through.  "
"WTH? How dare him to spend money that's not his. Even if you have joint finances, inheritance is a completely different thing.

This is dump-worthy."
"Why did you expect him to care? He drives around high, so he obviously has little regard for others' lives. Why would you date someone who doesn't care if he kills people by driving under the influence? Have some higher standards."
"this sounds like the next step. technically, the lease says we'll get a fine if we are caught with a pet that isn't on the lease. my cat is on our lease, so she's the only animal allowed to be here. the only damage she does is to my desk chair... lol. and while the pee pads are on the wood floor downstairs, that doesn't mean that damage isn't happening. it's not cool. it was never a discussion, it was just ""here he is, he's my stuff so he's coming with me."" but yeah. our property manager is pretty cool. i've read our lease over and over and haven't seen anything about penalties for breaking the lease, but i might reach out to him and ask some questions. since we live in a college town, they had us sign for our second year back in november before gf moved in so that the company would know what units will be available for incoming students. but the situation has changed now. our first lease is up in july, it's time for me to gtfo."
2nd this.  The only way to stop it is to tell him
He probably didn't tell you because he was also scared of how it would affect your relationship. Don't let part bother you.
"Yes exactly. I have a lot of grace for myself because I know how much he wanted kids and how much I have given up and changed so that we could have a family. Plus I do most of the work of raising them and that is not easy! If me having a hot body is essential to him he needs to find a way for me to have 2-4 childfree hours daily so that I can grocery shop, meal plan and prep, and work out! Ha! I do not feel bad about myself and my body and I would be pretty angry at him if he thought this is how I wanted to look. I don’t, but i’m doing my best to be healthy under the circumstances, and frankly I don’t give a f what he thinks about how I look during this phase of life."

"What the fuck? Stop having sex with a man who doesn't respect you and your sexual boundaries. You deserve better than this. He doesn't give a fuck about you and your sexual health. I'm a guy and while condoms have a *slight* effect on the feeling of sex, IT'S STILL SEX (which is a lot of fun) and more importantly I'M PROTECTING MYSELF FROM NOT BEING ON THE HOOK FOR A KID!! Like what if you got pregnant and decided to keep the kid? Is being on the hook for 18 years worth a little more pleasure from not wearing a condom? Wtf? This is a serious red flag and you need to stop having sex with this guy for now."
It’s important to take time for yourself to do nothing. Don’t burn yourself out. 
"They have been together 6 months, OP's sister just committed suicide, and he is sending her April Fools jokes at work then getting pissed because she's not considering his feelings. He's being selfish and self-absorbed, not panicking because life is short.  "
It sounds like your boyfriend would be the piece of shit who drives off as fast as he can in that situation...
"This whole thread has me thinking I'm on crazy pills! I own a dog and the thought that the OP shouldn't leave anything out ever because of someone else's poorly trained dog is shocking. People are saying that the OP orchestrated this and I'm thinking how on earth is leaving something in a common area orchestrated?? 

And it's hella odd for a dog to chew glasses... Does the dog have enough chewing toys? Is it stimulated mentally enough? 

Overall, yes, you shouldn't have charged her that much for older glasses, but in my opinion you have every right to be upset!"
Never ask her again. You mistook the trust. Look into a dog walking service and use that going further
"Your boyfriend has no respect for your choices, your boundaries or you by the sound of it. He will not be satisfied until you are doing exactly what he wants - you’ve presented him with tons of different ways he can eat the food he wants to eat without you needing to make changes to yourself and what you are comfortable with but this is clearly not good enough for him. Does he try and control other aspects of your life? What you wear or the hobbies and interests you have? 

He’s already tried manipulating you, and making you feel stupid. I’d be incredibly wary of him; may sounds drastic but his next tactic might be to cook a meal for you claiming it’s vegetarian or chicken when it’s actually beef or pork, just to prove a point that “SEE YOU ATE IT, IT’S FINE!”

He’s showing you his true colours; take notice. Your boundaries are your boundaries. Your choices are your choices, and no one else’s. Be with someone who respects those choices, those boundaries. Who respects you."
Just so you're aware....alcohol actually inhibits your sleep and disrupts your REM cycles....also it's not really normal for you to be NEEDING to drink every night to help you sleep....I think you should probably talk to someone about a possible drinking problem
"You should tell her you have something to talk to her about. Choose a time, she agrees on it.

Then sit down and talk. The most important thing she ought to realize is that ""God helps those who help themselves.""

And she is very biblically based, no? Remind her of the verse: ""Faith without works is dead."" Faith without ***works*** is dead. For example: she can pray all she wants that someone will become Christian. But, what, they are going to just wake up one day and decide to worship Him? No, it will probably take a Christian to do God's work and help them along.

Also, explain that God is not a genie. You can ask to see unicorns and cyclops, but that ain't happening. You can ask to grow a third arm but that ain't happening. God is like a father, and we are like the children -- we can *ask* for a new bike for Christmas, but we might be given a rusty scooter instead.

She can ask to get better without medicine, but just because God was asked does not mean that he has to oblige. ""The rain falls on the good and the bad."" You know exercise? And eating fruits and veggies? That is God giving us the tools to make ourselves healthy. He wants us to be healthy. But we must do the work ourselves to obtain it. A long time ago, people began creating drugs from God's creation in order to ease pain. Remind her of this. Ultimately, everything we have is from God -- that includes the ingredients in the medicine. God let the medicine be discovered so that ***we*** can do the work and yield the benefits. You don't get a nice vegetable garden by only praying -- you can pray, but you also have to water and fertilize to get products. God gave us rocks, plants, chemicals. It is up to us how to use them! Some of us have found more effective ways to use them than others.

So yeah, try that approach. If you want to change her mind, you have to come from where she is coming from.

If that doesn't work, as a last resort, there is always ""I don't want to lose my Mom. If you don't get treatment, there is a 99% chance I am going to be without you. You can ask God, but that doesn't mean that you are going to get what you want."" Mothers have a very strong instinct to be there for their offspring.

I am really sorry about this situation *hugs*"
"Piggy backing on this comment. 100% this.

Your parents took on most of the financial burden and you only had the honeymoon expenses plus extras. Many aren't even that lucky. Your husband is being so embarrassing with his continual comments, particularly considering so much of the event was paid for by your families and not by you or him. 

I got angry for you when he brought your period into the conversation. Has he always been this rude and dismissive of you when you bring up actual issues? Because he doesn't sound like he is mature enough to be married. It also sounds like he has already bad mouthed you to his family and thrown you under the bus for everything. From this post alone, your future is not very promising. There isn't so much you can do as he thinks you're the problem. Counselling will only actually work if he is willing to take accountability for his wrong doing and work with you as a team to solve the issue. Do your best but please don't blame yourself if it doesn't work out. It takes two for a marriage to work and he needs to meet you halfway on this issue. 

You really sound lovely and willing to put in the work. Wishing you the best and hopefully he takes ownership of his disrespectful behaviour."
"Yeah, I wouldn't want to see him anymore, and it's probably best for the kids in the family to not spend much time with him, either. I think you should keep talking to your mom, though. Your dad created this situation by his own behavior, and that shouldn't impact your relationship with your mom (unless she is cooperating in his behavior)."
"Whether or not he has a girl friend, I think it's tacky and immature that he has doodles on his arms like we used to do in middle school to each other. 

He's also not her friend. He's her superior because she is a teenager and an intern. Which makes this even more unprofessional and inappropriate. 


Just from a professional/work perspective this made me cringe."
"1. Your wife is extremely overprotective to an unhealthy degree. This blanket policy is totally random (what's to say a woman wouldn't abuse or hurt your kids?) and going to be extremely hard to enforce down the line. Yes, she should be in therapy. The kids are homeschooled as is, they need to experience the outside world and your wife is hindering their social development. 
2. Your sister was absolutely right to be insulted- what your wife requested was absurd and very rude to her husband. She needs to apologize directly to your sister, and you should encourage that she do so. Let the kids stay with her at her home. "
"You were groomed by a predator and now that there are consequences, he's using the power he's cultivated over you for years to control you. For what it's worth, I do think you should terminate the pregnancy, but after that you should cut him completely out of your life. Move, change your number, get into therapy, whatever it takes."
" ask the floor nurse to  meet you in the bathroom because you have a problem, so you can have privacy. 
Then tell her that your boyfriend is being abusive, and you need him removed. Ask the nurse what resources there are because you are overwhelmed.

 ask for a social worker to help you, too. They are experienced with this, and  have skills and resources. 

 Best wishes for you and your baby."
"Couldn’t have said it better. She’s wanting you to see things her way, hence the “in a stronger place and we can have a mature discussion now”. She won’t stop until you submit to her and see things her way.

"Honestly, if you told your friends the same thing you told Reddit, I have no idea where they got ""abusive and violent"" from. He hit a wall, immediately recognized it as red flag behavior himself, immediately told you it wasn't your fault in any way, went for a walk to cool down, and agreed that it was inappropriate behavior and that he should talk to you or a psychologist if he ever feels it building up like that again. 

Sure, it's a potential sign of future physically abusive behavior, but on its own with no other supporting signs, only *contradicting* signs? And they wanted you to *leave him immediately* over it? Talk about jumping the gun."
"She should not have gotten the dog but **THIS DUDE PRETENDED TO ABANDON HIS FAMILY IN FRONT OF HIS TWO LITTLE GIRLS. HELLO?** These kids are in kindergarten and third grade. These kids are fucking young. What she did is stupid, what he did is monstrous."
Oh I didn't know that was even legally the case with marriage. I know we always say it's 'like' we're married. I wonder if he knows that's the case...
"You're at the point where you should just tell him that it's a problem, it's causing issues, it's a health concern, and if he isn't willing to address it than this relationship can't continue. 

He'll get embarrassed no matter what, but it has to be addressed."
"I worked with a woman, T, who I thought was in her late 50's.   A few years after leaving the company I was in Vegas for a convention and I ran into a friend from the old company, and then a few minutes later T walked by coming from the pool in a bikini, she had an amazing body, stunning really and her skin was perfect, yet her face looked like she was 65.  I turned to my friend and made a comment about how amazing her body looked for such an old woman and that's when I learned when was 34.    She drank, she smoked and she used a tanning bed and it basically destroyed the skin on her face."
Kick this leech to the curb. He doesn't give a fuck about you and your family. 
"""Hey Bob, whaddya doin in those bushes out there!""

""Oh, my wife and I came down for the midnight show. Carry on!"""
"I want to chime in as a 40 year old woman who does a lot of maladaptive daydreaming as an escape mechanism in my own life. It is not celebrity obsession but more of a tendency to get lost in my head putting myself in fictional worlds with fictional characters as the person I wish I was, living an adventurous life as opposed to my own, which is not great. It’s not a healthy coping mechanism because I do it too much as opposed to taking meaningful action to engage with the real problems in the real world that are making me so unhappy (I also suffer from chronic depression and general anxiety disorder, which contribute to this behavior). So to an extent I empathize with your friend, at least her motivations, though I keep all my daydreams to myself, always. 

That said, she is next level. Your post started out cringeworthy and then got more and more alarming. I cannot imagine at this age plastering my home with boy band posters, *bringing a life size cut out to a dinner party* made me cringe so hard I nearly collapsed in on myself. I feel a bit silly when I watch a movie by myself in my living room just because Tom Hiddleston is in it and for no other reason. I think the poster above you had it right in that the pedo thing is to just show some self awareness about her situation, though the jokes are uncomfortable. But her weaponizing all your vulnerabilities against you because you said something she didn’t want to hear is crossing such a line that personally, I could never go back from. That’s a hard pass from me. 

But even that aside... she sounds exhausting. Her whole personality is wrapped up in obsessing over young, pretty boys. It’s her Thing and seems to be her Only Thing and if she dominates every conversation acting as a walking Page Six article about said pretty boy, what substance is there to the actual friendship? She wants a “squad” so bad but in theory if those were a real thing, presumably they’d be about solid friendships and being there for each other, not instagram photos and talking about boys constantly. Like, I’m not wild about being 40 either but even at 22 I didn’t act this vapid. 

I guess what I’m saying is even if you can come back from the hateful way she treated you when you dared put up any resistance to her constant domination of all conversations with her unhealthy obsessions, it’s okay to part ways with her simply for not enjoying this friendship anymore. 

Lastly, I’m very sorry about losing your father and grandfather, it sounds like a rough year, and I do hope you have some more supportive, down-to-earth friends who were and are there for you."
Healthy people don’t stay with alcoholics who aren’t interested in recovery. It would be one thing if he were an alcoholic who was seeking treatment and supported her in her own treatment. But instead he is attempting to undermine her purely for his own benefit.
I would at least discuss it with him. Work out how much he's likely to spend on condoms subtract that and break down the price from there. After all he'd have to contribute for any babies...
"I think I would put it to him this way: ""Honey, I don't want you ever to feel like you have to hide who you are. Ever. But that having been said, you need to know that the reality of the situation is that my family is transphobic. I'd like to talk through with you how to manage our relationship with my family if we get more serious. We don't need to make this decision now but I want to at least have a sense of each other's thinking.""  


Then, listen to what he says, and respond in kind, but I think it's reasonable to say something like: ""From my own perspective, I suspect it would make both of our lives easier if we don't talk to them about you being trans, for now at least. And I'd also suggest that we take basic steps for them not to find out, without going overboard -- like, you not friending them on social media. If we end up being really serious and you do want to come out to them in the long run, then we can strategize about how to do that then, but by that point they will already know and love you, which might change their reaction."""
"""We don't want to divorce, we agree. Divorce would be bad for our daughter and for us.""

No, staying in a marriage where you are unhappy would be bad for you and your daughter. It is so much better for a child to grow up with divorced parents than parents who fight constantly."
Hitler and Charlie Chaplin kind of look alike. Ask him to switch his hair cut to Charlie mood.
"&gt; This waitress is in a service job. She likely gets more tips by being involved with the kids and might even think she's helping. So you have to clarify to her that she's in a wrong position

With ten years cumulative experience waiting tables/bar tending: that is such a rookie mistake. What actually gets you tips is reading people and knowing when/if they want to interact. The best thing i ever learned to do as a server was to just **wait**. 

I hated working for corporate places because they often ignore this and push employees to bulldoze customers with an excess of service. 

&gt; OP, you're going to encounter this nonsense a lot more in motherhood, so you really need to step up and open your mouth when someone disturbs your kid. 

This is so true. I mildly freak put ever time i hear and adult declare themselves non-confrontational. It’s the most over used crutch of an adjective. No one likes putting themselves on the line socially, but you gotta do it to help yourself/others sometimes. 

&gt; I'm sorry, i know you really like Baby, but the attention is distracting her from her routine and our lunch. Could you please leave us alone to eat when the food is brought?"" 

This is a good script, but from a sales perspective, you can also word requests like people are doing you a favor and it sometimes helps:

“Hey, heads up [waitress]: we’re working really hard to set up a routine for the baby. Once the food comes, can you help us out by staying away? We’ll let you know if we need something.”

A server should jump at the chance to help a customer. More helpful = better tip. Especially the **right** kind of help. 

And that ends my caffeinated over-share!"
I hate to say it but my cousin Alice is just a lot more responsible than Lupe in a lot of ways. 
"Don’t treat it like a big deal, just be very matter of fact. If you can’t bring yourself to have a face to face convo then text. Send her a text that says “Hey, so looking at the bills the cost for this month is $X, plus the $Y amount from the last few bills. Are you able to pay me by Z date? Or should I just take it out of the rent payment this month?”

If you want to soften it you could add something about your budget not being able to cover her this month. Chuck in emojis, whatever your usual tone is. But don’t go into it apologetic or expecting her to be mad. Treat her like she’s not intending to screw you over and if you’re really friends that should help ward her off being defensive."
"This.  It’s time for a trip to an attorney to get your ducks in a row.  I’m pregnant and my boyfriend and I aren’t sure when we are getting married, so we both got wills set up and health care powers of attorney.

"It sounds like he wants to see what else is out there, but keep his foot in the door with you as a back up. Talking to a previous fling behind your back is super disrespectful. You need to consider whether or not you can get past this, and he needs to actually commit to the relationship and work on earning your trust back. No contact with the former fling, an open phone policy, and couples counseling would be somewhere to start."
"So so much this. I know I am going to sound like an asshole here, but she had... er... options when she realized the dad was not going to help out and the predicament she was in. She CHOSE to keep the kid without thinking of the consequences of that choice. Just because you didn't fuck up your life and are in a better position doesn't mean you owe her Jack. To be honest, neither does her father. Grown up decisions result in grown up consequences. Time for her to learn. 

The other part of this that you aren't thinking about is cool, she works in town. Who is going to take care of the baby during that time? She is young too, do what happens when she wants to go out. And of course once she moves in, if she is short on rent you are doubly the asshole for expecting rent because she didn't realize how expensive babies are. Not to mention she can't exactly keep the baby stuff just in her room, because the rent is $600 PER room, not for half the damn house. So you have toys, and bouncers in the doorways, and who cleans the mess up because she didn't realize how EXHAUSTING it is being a single mother while working. 

My mom was a single mother until my teens. When she remarried, my step dad worked 16 hour days so guess who got to experience the ""joys"" of raising 3 kids as a high schooler? Me. I had to help my mom feed my siblings, deal with screaming, colicky babies all night, change diapers, have 3 babies dumped on me at a moments notice because my parents needed   a break. Not going to lie, you want to prevent teen pregnancy, make them take care of multiple infants for a couple weeks. So all these situations aren't hypothetical, I lived through this crap with two educated, happily married adults that just couldn't handle infants AND careers and relied on family because I was close and easy to guilt into it."
Y'all were drinking BEFORE the axe throwing? What in the world?!
"First off, I’m extremely sorry that all of this happened to you, but friends aren’t items to fight over when a relationship ends. You don’t go to your divorce lawyer and say, “Well, I want Tommy and Brian, so she can take Maggie and Lauren.”

If they were sorta her friends first, it makes sense that they would gravitate towards her more, even if her behavior was awful. If you and your ex met them at the same time and had semi-equal friendships with them, your friends probably feel caught between a rock and a hard place. Damned if they do, damned if they don’t.

Friends are never a guaranteed in life. They come and they go. My best friend of almost 12 years has slowly faded from my life because we took different paths after middle and high school. My ex’s friends, who I was very close with during our 2.5 years together, and I haven’t talked since I broke up with him because they were his friends first and I anticipated it happening. My point is, friendships are not always for life. If you’re not happy because your friends are still maintaining a relationship with your ex, go out and meet some new people. Try some new things. Get out of your comfort zone.

Whether or not you cease those old friendships is entirely up to you and if it feels right to do so. But having a circle of people that doesn’t know about your ex at all sounds refreshing and healthy for you right now."
"Wow I really disagree with the voice of the commentariat on this post... I've had pets and roommates all my life and when they chew something up, then I offer my roommate compensation, simple as that. ESPECIALLY if it's something as important as glasses. And it shouldn't really matter if it's in the living room or not, and the existing bend in the glasses is immaterial in terms of repair costs as anyone with glasses knows. 

Presumably OP has lots of stuff in the living room  in a permanent sense, like furniture or books or video games. I wonder if everyone would be so forgiving towards the roommate if the dog chewed through video game cables."
"Buddy, what advice would you give a friend with this story?"
"He only washes every three days and he's a mechanic? Its sweaty and dirty work.

I think don't think theres much motivation to get the boiler fixed because he only showers twice a week. You need to shower every day. He's not paying attention to your needs. 

If it were me, I'd start getting more forceful because that's not the lifestyle I would want to live, especially if it costs nothing to get fixed or it's not going to be that expensive. It's not unreasonable to ask for hot water for a shower. 

Plus its costing electric to keep boiling a kettle for things like the washing up.

Is this a deal breaker for you?

I would suggest examining other aspects of your relationship for similar aspects to this. You both live there and both pay bills and, as a minimum, you should expect to have a shower with warm water.

If he can't fill out a simple form that only takes a few minutes then you're in for a ride. "
"Your fiance is being manipulative.  If she wants to lose weight that is her responsibility, not yours.

"Oh wow, he is putting his needs above yours.  He doesn’t want you to see a therapist because he’s afraid you or they will bring up his drinking, which he doesn’t want to change.  


So sorry.  


First, I give you permission to see a therapist even if your BF doesn’t approve.  (He understands why you’re going and wants to stop you).  


Second, your BF is afraid you’ll leave him due to his alcoholism.  And that’s ok.  You need to decide for yourself what kind of future you want.  You can google thru posts on this subreddit for what it’s likes to marry an alcoholic.  If I were you, I would let me therapist know I was living and dating an alcoholic who doesn’t want me to get help.  


Good luck"

We've know them for 7 years, and now our daughters are 13. Her daughter is going crazy to get away from home. she begs, cries and pleads, just for one sleepover, but her mother refuses. The girl, tells my daughter all the time, she can't wait to grow up, and get away from her home and parents. The sad part is, she has no skills. Sure, she can leave and go do what she wants at 18, but she has been so sheltered, and has no idea what's out there. Her mother has never told her why or the reason. Her daughter is so trusting and naive. If she does get out of there as soon as she can, I really feel sorry and scared for her. She has been done a real injustice by her parents.

"Wow, what a healthy start to your marriage.

Two problems to unpack here. First, you probably know this by now but it’s good advice to other young folk (or any folk really) - don’t have a wedding you can’t afford!! One extravagant day is not worth years of credit card debt hanging over you as you try to begin a new life together. The lack of foresight here was astonishing.

Secondly, the man you married is an ass. You both have debt because of decisions you made together, and he’s trying to pass all the blame to you instead of putting on his big boy pants and dealing with it. He also frankly sounds like a belittling, misogynistic asshole. When a guy’s reaction you having a valid heartfelt talk is to crack stupid remakes about you being on your period, you know you’re dealing with a jerk who doesn’t respect you.

What a mess, OP."

"You're serious about marriage and kids. He's serious about not actually committing but also not letting go of you. Proceed accordingly. And understand that a man who wants 4 kids in 10 years, but none between 25 and 35 is often the 35 year old who posts here about his 22 year old wife not being mature enough. "
"It sounds like hormones. Did she take anything besides birth control? When my boyfriend started antidepressants it had a similar affect on him.

"&gt; not sure if husband is being selfish or I'm being too harsh.

Well let's just clear that right up for you. 

Your partner is choosing not to show basic adult responsibility and household hygiene.    

Your partner is openly disrespectful and dismissive of you.  

Your partner is lying to you.  He is using a classic asshole lie about ""not seeing mess,"" which is easily disproven by showing how he is entirely able to perceive disorder when he wants to (like his work or his recreation).  He is also lying when he claims to be overwhelmed when you refuse to allow him to continue to shirk responsibilities.  

The only honest part of his behavior is when he tells you that he considers all of this your problem and your responsibility and he's not interested in changing it.  

When someone tells you who they are, believe them.  Your husband is outright *telling* you that he's selfish."
"First of all, cut off that unannounced-visit practice. That's disrespectful right out of the gate. Second, a husband puts his wife's concerns before his mother's. Third, find a good daycare and if asked about it, just say they have a great program and all her friends are there. Don't elaborate when MIL says, ""Oh, but I'd be happy to watch her."" Just repeat that they have a great program and all her friends are there and that your decision is final. "
"Yeah, 'checking out' people is normal. But making it obvious to anyone that happens to glance at him, including his own partner, is definitely a little off-putting. 

I mean, unless you want to stay quiet about it and let it fester, you could just sit down with him and explain the way it makes you feel. You don't have to be rude about it, you can just explain that while you appreciate that he's observant, the blatant-ness of it all just makes you uncomfortable. Nothing wrong with that at all. 

Watch for other rd flags, though, since this is a new relationship..."
"When you say no, he should respect you and leave it at that. If he needs relief that badly then he can go jerk off. His behaviour is going to damage your relationship (if it hasn't already), and the feeling of discomfort and being used is only going to get worse as you let this continue. You need to have a serious talk with him. If nothing changes afterwards, you should walk away and find a man who respects your boundaries."
"That the family doesn't know? 

Are her parents controlling and isolating her? 

She needs friends her own age. She may not be very mobile, but her mind should be that of a normal 20 year old. 

If she really can't have guests, then she needs online friends that she can call on the phone or skype with. 

The loneliness must be so hard on her, maybe even making it harder for her to cope with her illness. "
She only feels bad because you caught her in the act. 
"Your sister has every reason to be upset and your BIL even moreso. Your wife owes both of them, but especially him, a huge apology."
"A marriage is about the couple and their life together, but for *many* people, the wedding itself is about family and friends having the opportunity to celebrate the union in a way that is traditional to them.

By going the route you went, you:

1. Denied them the opportunity to celebrate a wedding with you, which they have assumed that they were going to do for a very long time

2. Concealed a major life change from them for more than two *years*.

They're hurt by what you've done, and it's their right to feel that way.  It will take them time to get over the initial hurt and begin thinking rationally about it.  Once they do, they will decide whether how you acted was something they want to forgive you for or not; that's *also* up to them.  You showed them through your actions that they don't matter as much to you as they *thought* they did, and now that they know that, they will have to decide for themselves how that makes them feel.  You also showed them (by concealing something like this for years) that you are what they probably consider dishonest, so that will affect their perception of you as well.

You need to give this time.  You need to give *them* time."
I think you're right. Writing this all out made me realize that I don't actually like her. I think I've been hanging on because of her brother. It's not worth it. I think she needs serious psychological help.
"I'm 21 years old and if i was being kid-gloved like your cousin it would upset me, frankly. I'm not fantastic at navigating conflicts with others and i do sometimes avoid people i don't like but that's really my problem and i wouldn't want my parents to enforce boundaries for me. This is kinda incoherent, sorry. If he can't spend time around people he doesn't like at 32 i can't imagine him having a very fulfilling and like, productive and satisfying life, because that's just a part of the adult world."
Congratulations on really taking control of your life! I wish I would have started antidepressants much sooner than I did. I feel like I could have spent so much less time unhappy and not moving forward.

I don't usually advocate for plastic surgery but it's likely she has destasis rectii (spelled wrong...not a medical pro) from her monster child pregnancy. So her stomach muscles are completely stretched out like an old rubber band and the only way to make them tight again is surgery. A friend had it and she literally had to fold her stomach into her pants. She got the surgery and she was so happy to just put on pants.  If you can afford it it might go a long way to make her feel like her old self.

You are not wrong for feeling upset. That's a very normal feeling to have in this situation, and the reason experts advise parents in situations like yours to tell their kids early so it's never this big, awful surprise. You should consider booking a few sessions with a therapist to talk through the swirl of emotions associated with finding this out. We'd all like to say it doesn't change anything, but to a certain degree, it does, especially in the short term when you are still coming to terms with it. Even though your Dad doesn't feel great right now, it's OK to take time to process the news. Are there activities the two of you enjoying doing together? Taking time to strengthen your bond would be helpful here. "

Beyond that, Lupe is essentially an incompatible roommate because she would be having the baby with her, and you do not want to live with a baby. You have no obligation to Lupe and you shouldn't feel bad about choosing someone else.

- you went to college and broke contact with them but they still made an effort to talk to you and even complained that they wanted to talk to you more 

-you grew up with parents that allowed you to be independent without helicoptering your every move 

-you grew up with parents that loved one another, with what I’m assuming, little fighting (which is extremely rare)

And this is totally an ""our problem"" and not just a ""her problem"". As is all other problems of the marriage. ;) It's always helpful to look at it from the ""Us vs. the problem"" viewpoint instead of ""you vs. me"". 

 I agree with your sister. You both really need to understand that it really does go both ways. She's absolutely valid in her feelings on this and has every right to restrict access to her child when you don't have the same courtesy or trust for her and her family. When we are married we are all package deals. If ANYONE told me I can't bring my husband or he can't be around, then I won't be either. And neither will our child. We are all a package deal. You don't get to pick and choose.  

And your wife should be upset, but upset at what the consequences of her choices really are. For one, being a parent doesn't make you automatically a good parent. For two, it's understandable that your sister wants no part in this dynamic. But if your wife wants to cut people off, she's going to have to accept that she will lose friends and family in doing so because she's actively hurting and insulting them. 

Be careful what you wish for. You just might get it. "

If you yourself have had negative experiences with much-older men taking advantage of your youth and naïveté, share how that impacted you. Make it personal and concrete.

1. if you are at all a dog person, GET A DOG. My ancient 16 pound Chinese  Crested thwarted a breakin at my house once. A barking dog is better than a house alarm. I'm not saying not to have house alarm, but a dog is great.

2. get and read ""The Gift of Fear"" by Gavin de Becker. 

3. Nest camera or other good camera. We have a Nest camera, and we get alerts on our cellphones everytime someone enters the proximity of the camera. It recognizes people we know, so we are just alerted for new people.

4. Get a lawyer. I actually was a lawyer when I was being stalked, but I retained someone to represent me, and it was very helpful. 

In my case, I ended up moving and not putting my name on the title of the house we bought, which was legally risky vis-a-vis my husband but worked out. I kept my location on a need-to-know basis for years. But that was before social media.

Be very vigilant. He is not a well person. Always have your cellphone charged and at hand.

Be honest with yourself. How do you feel about your marriage? Not perfect, right? Why not have to a heart to heart with him. Talk to him about how much you love him (you do love him, right?), but how you feel that things could be better. Maybe it wouldn't hurt to go to a couple's counselor for a marriage tune up.

"Reading her message is so sad.  It's just so... Self centered and judgemental.  It makes me mad how she puts thoughts and feelings in your mouth as it is.  It even starts off accusing you, as if you decided to be gay because you wanted to hurt them.  

If you ever wonder if there's anything you can do to mend things just know she absolutely sounds delusional and pathetic.  Do the best you can with you life, it's normal to desire a parents approval even though you know the person is no good for you.  Knowing it's normal to have complicated hopes can make it easier when they flare up, because logically you know she's no good for you.  She really sees herself as a victim of you, I'm proud that you're trying to move away from her influence. "
"&gt; The moment I broke the news to him the first thing out of his mouth was ""you are having a natural birth""

&gt; throughout the years, we had several heated discussions (some of which were Really bad, once he told me that if I did not have a natural birth he was not going to show up at the hospital) about the fact that I wanted a c section and he wanted me to have a natural birth. 

&gt; The last one was around 2 years ago so I figured he had realized that, you know, it is my body. But apparently I was wrong.

I think you really should reconsider whether you keep this guy in your life as a partner. He seems to be more interested in what *he* wants than your bodily autonomy or mental health needs."
"&gt;I can understand if his family life is good then he just doesn't know what having an abusive parent is like, but that doesn't mean he gets to try and force a connection between you and your mother because that's how he thinks things should be.

Exactly. I also feel like it is a massive failure of empathy for someone to not get that abuse = bad just because their upbringing was fine. Like, it's not really that hard to understand? I don't know what it's like to have abusive parents either. My parents are totally fine. But somehow I CAN grasp basic stuff like ""if your parents abused you, you might not want them in your life anymore,"" because I can *imagine*. Can people like OP's boyfriend not imagine any situation that hasn't literally happened to them?"
"She can’t have it both ways...stay home if you don’t trust the babysitter. 

Even FATHERS molest and rape their own children. Is she going to send you away next?"
"She didn't recognize you, which was your first clue she had no interest in you.  

Saying you've noticed her at work and had been meaning to ask her out, tells her you think she's hot/cute and want a date just solely based on her looks.  That comes across as a bit uncomfortable and like you might just be looking for sex and/or were checking her out at her job, which is uncomfortable.

She turned you down for the coffee and the pause before she answered meant she was making up an excuse because she didn't want to go with you.

Then you doubled down and offered your card, which means you didn't get the hint that she wasn't interested, but were more interested in pursuing your agenda of getting a date than her comfort.

&gt; Did I come off creepy in my approach? 

For many women, yes, that would be creepy and especially for a young woman who has less practice in saying no and exercising her boundaries.

&gt;Is it creepy that I have seen her occasionally for weeks and wanted to ask her out because I thought she was cute?

Not creepy to be think she's cute, but you should have just attempted a casual chat first, not went straight to asking for a date.  Especially since she has clearly NOT noticed you, even in just a ""he's cute"" way.

&gt; Did I do something that would make most women feel uncomfortable?

""Most"" women, hard to say.  Many women?  Yes.

&gt; Was there a better way to ask her out? 

How about by NOT asking a stranger out?  You could have just said ""hey, I recognize you from the store!  What's your name, I'm Bob"".  Then just had a casual conversation if she was willing, and not asked her out unless she showed an interest in something more than just a casual chat. 

In general, women don't like being approached and asked out by strangers because we know you interest in 100% only physical at that point.  It makes us worry that you're just looking for sex, or might be pushy about physical intimacy, or ignore our boundaries.  We want to be asked out because you are interested in us as a PERSON, which means you need to have some casual conversation before asking her out.

&amp;#x200B;"
I suspect it's less about the ultimatum and more about her total unyielding lack of respect for you clashing with you daring to speak up for yourself instead of being OK with whatever crumbs of self-respect she allows you to have for yourself.
"It’s funny, but the BF is absolutely right: a therapist is paid money for their services, and in this case those services will very likely involve highlighting the unnecessary destructive relationship OP is in.

"&gt; my heaviest grief happened before the death

Same with me when we lost our mom to cancer.

Echoing as well  what u/arahzel said:

&gt; No one ever grieves how they expect, 

in my case the anticipatory grief came with a lot of anger (mainly directed at myself). The grief after her actual death felt kind of surreal, like my brain wasn't catching up to what was happening. 

Basically grieving is a very confusing time. "
"I can’t stand when people feel the need to get a pet and don’t even have time to be at home with it. What’s the point of an animal if it’s alone or locked up for all hours? I had a roommate with a dog, not like yours but there were a few accidents, and I’ve never owned a dog and it was really such a hard adjustment. Don’t get me started on the smell.. Of course nothing on that little puppy soul, but some dogs just suck hard. Get out and be glad."
"Do you really want to stay with someone who cheated on you and you can't be sure they'll do it again? For your own mental health I'd say don't hold onto this guy, it'll eat you up eventually thinking about it. "

That’s a pretty unhealthy basis for a relationship. Any relationship.

"&gt; So I was content to let this just sort of fester for a few more years because I have a feeling things will sort themselves out. 

WHAT."
Your boyfriend’s reasons for not marrying are all reactive which means that he’s still acting in relation/opposition to his parents.... that means he’s not driving his own bus - the momentum and motivation that fuels his actions still originate from them. It’s a fallacy that he’s acting from will — he’s not. He’s as controlled now by them as he would be by doing everything they say.....
"To have and to hold, in sickness and in health, and until death do us part, provided my feelings don't change in the future. But hopefully that won't happen! I do."""
OMG four days post partum I couldn't barely pee.  That is like fucking an open wound.  Anyone who would enjoy doing that to their partner is not a 'partner' worth the word.
"He's an adult and should take care of his finances responsibly on his own. Don't baby him too much with paying off his bills or else he'll keep relying on you. Have him take financial course or watch Dave Ramsey's videos on youtube. He needs to figure it out on his own to pay off his own debt, not relying on his significant other to pay the debt for him. I find that wrong. You need your money in case of an emergency: car problems, hospital bills, or family emergency back home. Have a jesus meeting with him and tell him that he can't keep hiding his debt from you and expect you to pay off the credit card bills. "
"I have not celebrated my birthday in 10 years. I dont recieve presents, not even from my wife. I dont tell her what I want, so she just gets me something small,or nothing. I prefer it this way. I dont like people making a big deal of me, I dont like to be the center of attention, and dont like sweets. He may not like to be made a big deal of. However, it is his day, and he is the one that should choose how to celebrate. Talk to him, and let him know how you feel. Ask him if there is anything you can do for his birthday. If he declines, respect that. At least you'll have a little closure on the topic. "

"Living in Australia, there is support available to you. Firstly my advice is to never ever touch serious drugs. I say this because you are in environments where they are around all the time and have a family history so this behaviour may be normalised to you, but as you can probably see it will seriously fuck up your life. Second, talk to a teacher or similar at your school, they should be able to offer you at least emotional support and some pathways out of this situation. Third, speak directly to Centrelink. I believe that you are likely in a position to be declared independent from your family due to the abusive and unstable situations you have been placed in and should be able to start receiving payments directly. I know the payments are seriously inadequate but use that money to get a room in a sharehouse with stable people. If you don’t get far with Centrlink, go to a community legal service for help. Fourthly, try to get a job of some kind so you can have some of your own money and supplement to Centrelink. If you feel comfortable letting me know your approximate location by DM I can refer to specific services if you are in NSW."
"&gt; I wish I could uninvite her already 

You can! You literally can. But you don't **want** to, presumably because you don't want to be faced with her tantrum, or feeling guilty, or pressure from other people. But all of that can be overcome if you choose to.

She's dreadful, you know she's dreadful. She can ""expect"" or ""insist"" or ""demand"" as much as she likes, but you don't have to do a damn thing. Hanging up on her is the right approach. Tell her no, to everything. Don't JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain). She can like it or lump it. She can act like she has a right to things, that doesn't mean she has that right, and you can just tell her no, then when she pitces a fit, hang up the phone or leave the room. Avoid her as much as possible, and make it clear it's because of her attitude. Of course she'll scream and pout and cry and claim you're a bad daughter, but she can't actually **do** anything about it. Ignore her words, rise above it, do what's right for you, and let her stew in her own misery."
"I don't think you will get through to your brother. 
It really sounds like he hasn't gotten over the death of his wife, and he is trying to mask his pain with a new relationship. I don't think you will get through to him because then he would have to admit that he doesn't really love this person. "
"I can see why he would be surprised by this. If you hold the moral standard that cheating is not ok (as most in committed relationships do), then you also would typically not partake in cheating, even if it's not your relationship. He probably feels as if you don't value loyalty and trust in a relationship and he may be worried about his relationship with you. 

When he just thought you were a sugar baby, what you were doing wasn't harming anyone else, so he likely was cool with it because of that. But once he understood that it involved married men, now that is doing something that would cause harm to the other involved parties and you could potentially be contributing to destroying someone's marriage if it was found out. 

It seems like maybe a little bit of a clash of morals, maybe you should just sit down and talk with him about it in a manner that would reflect how this situation would affect your current relationship or not moving forward. Was this just the past, or are these still beliefs that you hold / would you still do the same thing today if you were in that situation? What values in a relationship are important to the each of you? I think that's important to talk about."
Wow. Run like hell. He's an asshole . 
"&gt;  ...we're under alot of pressure we're both working underpaying jobs and are barely able to make ends meet...

Okay, and yet you still seem to be managing to remain as a decent and respectful human being, so that's obviously not what's causing her to be such a total arse..."
"""Boyfriend, you are not my parent. Stop telling me what I should and shouldn't do. I'm an adult and I need you to stop trying to control me.""

If he can't stop doing that, then you need to think long and hard about how willing you are to build a life with a controlling boyfriend who doesn't respect you as an adult."
"He doesn’t sound like a very driven person to me considering he slacks on school, chores, etc... He sounds like a shallow person to me. You’re allowed to take naps, sleep in and not live at the gym. Essentially, it’s okay to be your own person and not what he tells you to be. Personally, I’d show this guy the door. "
Good. Don't explain it further than that; just keep repeating this good answer.
"OP, dump the abusive boyfriend and go to the great school. Yes, his threats of suicide are abuse. Do not sacrifice something like a good education for some other guy. If he threatens something dumb during the break up, get police involved."
No offence but I figured this was the root of your problem. Stop watching pornography. You're harming your sexuality and doing yourself and your wife a huge disservice.
"That's because he doesn't want to live with a newborn baby. Whoever lives or rooms with her, will also, have to help take care if the baby. You just need to tell them, your a young girl, looking to have fun, and you have no interest in playing Three woman and a Baby. It wouldn't be an ideal environment for a newborn, and a new mother. "
I’d rather set up a discrete smoke spot. The smell bothers a lot of people.

"Sounds like your mum was thrown back to shopping for swimsuits when she was your age and struggling because she was (I assume) teased for being bigger/big boobs etc.

She sees you and probably thinks “you’re so lucky you never have to worry about fitting in”. She may even be a little bit jealous.

Plus you’re 14. It’s a weird age where she may still see you as her baby whereas you don’t think you are.

I hope she wasn’t actually trying to put you down or hurt your feelings, but I would guess that because she was bigger, it doesn’t even occur to her that you being skinny isn’t so great as far as you can see. Try telling her how you feel a bit and hopefully she’ll get it. “Mum when you said I was so skinny and should be in the kids section it made me feel (insert feelings), and because I’ve been bullied about it at school it hurt even more.” See where the conversation goes from there"
"A lot of people on here saying its PPD, but sometimes it isnt. Sometimes its straight forward realising you're not cut out for this and that this isnt what you wanted, that the idea of having a baby because your friends are having them are far different from actually having one, especially if your were fairly certain you didnt want one previously. A sort of buyers remorse. There is this weird misconception that every woman who has a child has a mother instinct or that it will 'kick in later'. The idea of a woman walking awY from her family seems unthinkable to many and these women are judged so much harder than men who do the same.  

If she doesnt want therapy, walk away and take your son. You and your wife will be happier for it. If you have doubts, visit the subreddits detaling hundreds of posts of emotional and or physical abuse suffered by Redditors under the hands of women who raised kids they never wanted. "
"&gt;From the OP it doesn't look like they've really taken time to discuss and handle as a unit.
It has been five days. 

On the day after the suicide, boyfriend started pressuring her on a sensitive issue-- sure, makes sense if the suicide made him wake up to mortality; but rather than respect her request that they not discuss it yet, he got upset and stopped talking to her. This was a point where boyfriend could have set aside his feelings in order to handle things as a unit. He refused. 

The next day-- third day after the suicide-- she made a reasonable mistake, reminded him that she was distraught, and he told her to consider *his* feelings and not talk to him ""until [she] was calm."" Here, again, as soon as she said she needed to focus on herself/her grief, he refused to talk to her rather than trying to understand or help her (""as a unit""). 

At this point she has no reason to believe she can rely on him emotionally. He's shut her down when she expresses her grief. He's placed the onus on her to do all of the emotional/mental work of being a successful couple: she has to temper her grief to be considerate of him, while he refuses to discuss or handle her grief at all. All in all, /u/Throwaway58103741, I think that even if your boyfriend contributes material labor like taking the children, his refusal to offer a scrap of emotional labor or *consideration* is a red flag so big you could see it from space.

My SO and I rely on each other in a crisis, but that doesn't mean that if my immediate family member committed suicide I would be focused on my SO's feelings. Au contraire: it means that I would know I could rely on him to support me while I'm focused on my needs, my immediate family's needs, and surviving day to day life. I sure wouldn't be replying to funny articles three days after the suicide. And if there was a death in his family, I would not expect him to give any consideration to my needs in this kind of timeframe. I would want to be a support structure, a place where he could express his grief and focus on himself, not another thing demanding his attention and consideration. 
"
"From your description, he makes you generally miserable all the time and sometimes happy. 

I don't know you at all, but I'm willing to bet that a big part of the ""happy"" times is actually normal for other people and just happy for you because it's not the miserable you've grown to expect....."
Honestly how does she still have a husband? This behavior is insane.
"&gt; divorce is on the horizon.

DON'T LET HIM KNOW THIS.  Abusive men don't usually let their victims just walk out on them--you're his *property,* after all, and he will move heaven and earth to keep you under his control.

Plan this *carefully.*  Have all communication with your lawyer conducted on work phones and emails, for example, and any research you do on how best to escape an abusive relationship can't be done on any personal electronics.  

Both Thehotline and loveisrespect have advice on constructing your escape plan, and you can either call or chat with someone at either organization for information about this or anything else.  A local women's shelter may also have resources for you.

Read both *Why Does He Do That?* and *The Gift of Fear*--as always, keep both books at work, a friend's house or the library.  These books will give you an idea of what the aftermath of leaving him is going to look like, and how to prepare yourself for it.

Finally, **therapy.**  Abuse has warped your brain and a good therapist will help you restore it to its original factory settings."
"I think it’s time to set an ultimatum that she has to get treatment for her anxiety, or your marriage won’t continue. It’s not just affecting you now; you have to protect your daughter too. I’m sure it’s just as easy for you to imagine as it is for me all the ways this can result in her, frankly, ruining your daughter’s childhood. 

When you’ve discussed her getting treatment before, what’s her objection? Have you ever plainly told her that this is adversely affecting your marriage, and you worry about her ability to parent?"

"Models are scouted at 13/14/15. Entering the industry as an adult is not happening. I can tell you this from personal experience in the industry. 

If you get scouted for a major agency, you're dropping out of HS and moving to NYC/China/Japan/Seoul and working crazy hours just to build a profile. Modeling is NOT a side part time job. Majority of the models are broke. Even the ones who walk for Chanel. 

Your daughter sounds too naive to understand how the industry is run. You need to dedicate 110% of your time to modeling to ""make it"". You're not going to college or HS. Castings don't even extend past 21 now. They're really not hiring 18 year olds or older teens. They may say they are but they're not.
If you don't make it as a teen, you're done with trying to make this career livable.

Your daughter needs a reality check. Your wife needs to stop bullying her. She should pursue College. Giving up your education and turning 30 and retiring forcefully from modeling where you barely got paid, is not a wise career choice.

Most models come from poor poor areas where living in a small apartment with 20 girls is seen as an upgrade. Education is not their ticket out of their hometown. Modeling is. "
"&gt;When we were younger she could play pranks, push me over or take my things to upset me, and we were ''just playing together'' but if I did something that even slightly annoyed her I would be told off and she would get comforted.

"""My boyfriend thinks I'm an idiot who can't take care of myself and doesn't know my own ass from a hole in the ground and belittles me so I don't have the confidence to do what I need to do for myself and get rid of him.""

As I always ask, what is so wonderful about this guy that it makes up for him treating you this way? What are you getting out of this relationship?

(This is the question my mum asked me when I was married to an abuser. It helped me realize that there was nothing he could have done or said that made up for treating me the way he treated me and nothing I could have done or said that justified the treatment.)"
Because one person has to actually wear the ring? It’s pretty straightforward. 
"Cheating, violence, deception, vendettas, divorce, I've seen it all here.  But this?

This is a new low for humanity."
I bet a beer at a bar that this is the correct answer.
Is there some sort of middle ground here? Maybe she is missing physical contact period? Could you accomplish some level of similar connection through a long hug or kissing her forehead in a platonic way?
Sooner or later you're going to have to understand there's a difference between making your partner understand that you're technically correct and making your partner happy.
"If I were you I’d delete this post, wipe your history and cookies, and literally never breathe a word about this to anyone ever again, online or irl. Your wife will not recover if she finds out you’re thinking things like this. 

My advice is to use her as your only source of sexual desire for a while. Stop watching porn, have her send you nudes, get off with her more often than not. You will learn things about her that you like and (hopefully) grow to associate her naked body with sexual pleasure. See her not only for her body, but also for how good of a mother she is, how great of a partner, etc. Learn to appreciate the stretch marks and scars as they are her proof that she was so strong in giving you a family and continuing your family name and legacy. That’s a huge deal. Your wife is the mother of your children, appreciate the marks on her that prove what she’s done for you. 

I also second the idea of lingerie. You could especially get her a lace body suit/teddy style lingerie (think a one piece swimsuit) or something of that sort if you think she could be into it - it might even help her feel more confident since she’d technically be more covered, but still sexy. 

Trying new things in the bedroom also might help get both of you excited for each other again. 

All you can do is try to spark your sexual relationship and reframe the way you see her."
I did that and it was excruciating. :sigh: You can easily grow to hate and detest a partner that is fine with that level of self-sacrifice.
"Why is noone staying the obvious that they were likely involved for a good while BEFORE his ex passed?  I mean, even without the recently deceased ex wife and mother of your kids, 3 months is INSANELY fast to have met someone new, fallen in love, transitioned into being serious, and then proposed.  Heck, even in the context of a vanilla breakup after a relationship of just one of two years, this timeline is mad suspect."
"I am trying to understand what the problem is here.

You are basically having a problem with your GF having an amazing friend with whom she can be open about everything and who responds with really helpful advice. If everyone had a friend like this, no one would need therapy.

"You told the woman you're marrying that you don't know if you'll always love her, because you can't know for sure that you'll be always together? 

Look. I think get what you were trying to get at, but you failed spectacularly in the delivery. Of course no one knows for SURE-sure if their marriage will last, but damn."
"This is totally the opposite of the type of advice I would usually give, but IMO you need to stop being a good sport about this so-called ""joke."" You tell him one more time that you don't find the joke funny, it makes you feel humiliated and hurt, and you refuse to play along with it. Then you enforce the boundary.  If he does it again at his place, you leave, if he does it at your place, you kick him out, etc. It won't take long for him to realize that this joke isn't fun for anyone any more and knock it off. "
"it's bad enough that she's sunk into the horribly manipulative world of ""multilevel marketing"", the fact that she commandeered your literal wedding into peddling her shit is honestly reprehensible. i would have serious doubts about what your relationship means to her, which is an awful thing to say, but.... talk to her, she's gotta get her shit together or else your money and, it seems, your relationship will be gone fast."
"It might be tolerable to deal with asexuality, but not with her refusal to communicate.  I'm sorry to be cold, but you aren't married, just living together.  She has a right to be asexual, or to use toys in private, or to no longer love you.  She does not have the right to expect you to stay married and behave as a husband, and to keep you in the dark for seven years.   I'm again sorry to be cold, but there's a difference from loyalty, support, and wanting to work things out, and groveling.  I would suggest you establish some minimal standards of openness and communication.  If she wants to stay married to you she may not owe you sex, but she owes you honesty and communication about sex.  If you beg for something she owes you, and roll for it when she doesn't behave as a responsible adult, you'll be stuck forever.  I'd say it's long past time you split and find someone who will take responsibility for communicating with you."
"You need to talk to a therapist about this. Your jealousy at your fiance's social life is just the symptom of an underlying cause (of which, I wouldn't even try to speculate).

"Depends on your mom and what she's like, maybe if you frame it like you're starting something new and are saying goodbye to the old name that doesn't serve you any more and are inviting her to do that with you if she's interested."
"When I broke up with my ex and cited his lack of help around the house as one of the many reasons I was unhappy in our relationship, he cried out, ""I had NO idea it was that important to you."" Somehow, he had thought that me asking/begging him on a DAILY basis to please do more around the house was not important, until I was actually about to leave him over it. He begged for another chance, but even if he became a perfect house-husband from that moment on, the years of being ignored and having to pick up his slack had completely eroded any love I had for him."
Yeah I'd just be honest. Provide her with some potential resources and let her know that you're feeling overwhelmed and that there's no reason she shouldn't be able to handle these issues on her own. Someone asked her for a cigarette and she freaked out? Sobbing over a cockroach? This woman must have been babied by her parents up until the moment she moved. I would not have tolerance for that either. 
"Please get therapy for yourself. 

My suspicion is that you are unfairly accepting all the blame. 

All of us can be better people, but you are accepting all the blame and are convinced that everything he says about you is true. I highly doubt that. 

Therapy will help you recognize truth from fiction. You will work with a neutral third party and be able to see the truth. 

Yes, I am sure your husband is unhappy, but it takes 2 for a successful marriage and he would rather just blame everything on you. That is selfish, wrong, and likely abusive. 

Try to be a better person, but make sure it is on your terms and based on your values."
"So ask him not to friend your family. My bet is his social media accounts are pretty locked down. Respect his privacy and focus on your relationship. Your family doesn’t have to know. Not to make light of the situation, but I certainly don’t talk to my family about what is going on in my husband’s pants."
"Agreed with this wholly. He’s testing your boundaries. Truthfully, this screams future abuse to me. These are clear warning signs. "
"Maybe he's like ""Well why doesn't she want to have sex yet when she's so clearly into sex?"" However, if that's the case he should just talk about it. "
"I'm sorry, he's just not that into you. He is telling you how he feels, if you'll listen.


Please cut him loose and try with someone else."
"If OP's husband won't help her and she can't communicate sufficiently with the MIL due to a language barrier, this is the best solution. Then when MIL leaves, OP can tackle her and her husband's issue regarding the way he clearly values his mother over his wife. "
"I think your first steps should be to talk to a doctor. Talk to a professional, express your concerns, express what you want, and come to an informed decision about the future for your body with a doctor's help. Then, once you've done that, you can involve your boyfriend with letting him know what the decision is. If presented to him from the perspective of a professional medical decision involving other people, there will be less room for him to argue with you. If he still tries to, don't engage."
"&gt; Why do you keep running in to them? Is it a small campus?

Is there a reason he can't work a part-time job while going to school like the rest of us? 
"&gt; Do I tell him to leave?

I probably would.  I mean, this is really shocking.  I do understand he may not be earning as much as he otherwise could because he moved to Australia to be with you, but you more than make up for that by covering a disproportionate part of the rent and by treating him to food and drinks.  

I think you could try to work it out but that would have to involve a lot of setting boundaries.  For one thing, you *must absolutely not* pay off his debts for him, that's just a way to let him take even more advantage of you.  He's not paying his credit cards, why would he pay you back?  But also, he needs to be paying off his debts, not running up more debt, he needs to be contributing equally to the rent (at least soon), which means he needs to find a better-paying job, etc.  Personally I don't think he can hack it.  I think if you lay out demands like these he will whine and whine about it or just give up on the relationship.  But if you need to feel like you gave him a chance, go ahead.

Also, give him back the ring.  Tell him you can't accept a gift from him that he can't afford.  "
I was going to say the same thing! So sweet and clearly he is doing a great job as a grandpa!
"Jesus, I would tell her how she behaved was completely unacceptable and if she doesn’t apologize to your family the relationship is done. I don’t mean to be so harsh but like that was rude and that’s a flash of how she’ll treat you when she doesn’t get her way in the future. She doesn’t care who is around to see it"
"I hate that. My roommate and good friend has a little cousin that she babysits often, and when she does it's assumed that I'll be home to help, aka basically take over, even if I have plans.

I don't mean to sound like an asshole - I'd gladly watch him anytime I'm *asked* to, for free even if it's just for a bit, unless I already made pretty big plans previously. I just don't like the assumption that I can help anytime regardless of what I'm doing, as if nothing in my life is as important as a baby.

It's the assumption I dislike and I feel for OP. Sure my plans probably aren't as important as a baby, but my dad said to me the other day, ""You chose not to have any children yet, because you don't want to care for a baby right now. And that's a fine choice to make. So don't feel bad about not wanting to care for a baby.""

OP chose not have kids yet and her cousin did. OP doesn't want a baby in her home so she's not obligated to have one. It's up to her cousin to be responsible for the baby, instead of forcing a child into the life of someone who chose not to have one, and that doesn't make OP a bad person."
Stop talking to anyone about this.  See a criminal lawyer immediately and get advice for how to turn the laptop over to police so victims and perpetrators can each get their due.
"I’m going to be honest - I feel like you overreacted a lot. I thought, from the title, you had proof she blocked you. It’s possible it was a mistake, especially since she got a new phone or maybe she changed something else and messed things up. Without having any other reason to suspect she might be up to no good, you wouldn’t let her wait to look into it before throwing a fit, needing answers right then and there while she was driving, and ruined a trip over it. Without any real proof that she did this on purpose. It’s fishy, yes, but you even said that cheating isn’t something she’d do - why not give her the benefit of the doubt and figure it out calmly at a time when she’s not driving? 

Obviously there’s no trust here already. It could be because she doesn’t deserve it - which I don’t get that from here, but maybe there’s more to the story - or you have serious trust issues. That’s on you to work on btw. Just because an ex treated you dirty doesn’t mean you should take it out on a current gf and ruin a vacation. 

You have a right to leave a relationship for any reason, and you don’t need a reason. If it’s not working for you and you can’t trust her, whatever that reason may be, that’s good enough reason."
"Report it to HR. Coworker A should also be coming with you to report, if they are truly not okay with what was said. These are not children on a school playground who don't know any better - these are adults, and this is a workplace. Specifically, this is *your* workplace, and you do not deserve to be exposed to racist comments at work. Asking professional adults to not be openly racist in the workplace is a pretty minimal expectation; there is no chance that someone honestly thinks it's okay to make a ""ching chong"" accent or make cat-eating jokes in 2019. 

Not reporting sets a precedent that these kinds of racist jokes are okay, and if nothing is said, they will continue. "
"Responsible people quit their job once their passion becomes more profitable (or when the only thing keeping that passion from becoming equally profitable is the time spent doing the first job).

It's why the phrase ""Don't quit your day job"" exists. It's advice to prevent situations like this one."
By the sound of it their sex life needs a blowtorch. 32 years of infrequent irregular sex does not the case for marriage make. 
"Man, your sister and the rest of your family sound so wonderful and pleasant to be around - I can totally see why you want to continue to spend time with them! /s

""Family is forever"" is a bullshit concept that's only touted by abusive family members and people who have been charmed enough to never have to deal with toxic, abusive ""family"" members.

What are you really standing to ""lose,"" here? They don't support you, they don't ""side"" with you - they don't seem to praise you or offer much unconditional love or support. It seems like the only people that would be ""losing"" anything is *them* - I wonder who will serve as their emotional punching bag and plaything after you're gone?"
"His birthday is about him, not you. If it’s “not enough” for you, this minimalism, maybe you need an outlet that excites you. Don’t expect him to join. "
"My girlfriend isn't ever going to tell her religious grandmother that I'm trans and I'm 100% okay with that. The fact he waited a bit to tell you indicates to me being out isn't important to him, he just didn't want you to find out by surprise when y'all got sexually active. He may be out to his friends and job and family just because he had to be. I couldn't exactly hide from work and people who've known me for years when I asked to be called a guy's name and started talking testosterone, but don't need new people to know. Ultimately you should talk to him about it though, just letting you know it shouldn't be offensive to ask if he'd remain stealth around your family at least while they get to know him."
"One thing that stood out is your dad saying he thought she was happy. *Thought*. I would wonder how much communicating--real, deep, thoughtful--communcating either one of them did prior to their divorce.

By your own description, your dad doesn't even do that much communicating with you, his child.

Sure, it's possible that someone could just wake up one day and do a total 180 out of the blue, deciding they're actually not happy with what once was a perfectly fine relationship. But what is more likely is that your parents never had great mechanisms in place to facilitate their emotional intimacy and communication, and over time it just became unsustainable as they matured into different people.

Just communicate with your wife. You mentioned being really worried about this. Have you mentioned your worries about this to your wife yet? Have you guys ever discussed your anxieties and insecurities? If not, now is the time."
Or c) he’s cheated and is deflecting
Report the damn dog already
I would literally bet $500 that he doesn’t talk to you. 
"Taking it once fucked me up and I did t get a period for three months, I couldn’t image what taking it repeatedly would do to someone! 

If a guy is THAT worried about getting someone pregnant then he should do his part and pull out (in addition to the condoms) instead of forcing her to take something that can have lasting effects on her body."
"She is sexist. The wife of your father is just as likely to be a predator as your sister's husband.  Her ""policy"" isn't really helping keep your kids safe, just assuaging her anxiety.  Homeschooling them, and with this level of helicoptering, these kids will go koo koo bananas the second they get an ounce of freedom. I've seen it, being an orientation counselor at university. The kids who haven't been allowed any freedom are the ones getting super drunk and sleeping with whoever because they've never had a chance to learn how to function safely on their own."
"&gt;he has no clue when relationships are falling apart and just hopes things will get better on their own

A deeply hidden truth that OP may need to reevaluate his life and choices in marriage and family."
"I had the exact same problem. I always thought she just doesn't like me. But I just straight up asked her one day and she explained that a long time ago she did say bless you when I sneezed but apparently i did not reply back with a thank you, so she thought I didn't like hearing bless you everytime I sneezed. 
I actually don't remember not saying thank you. I just never crossed my mind. I apologised and we both laughed at the miscommunication. She definitely does day bless you everyone I sneezed now."
"Full-stop all reasoning aside, he lied to you about what it was. You specifically asked, and you have discovered thats not true. If he is as tech-savy as you say he would have divulged that to you.
If he was aware of the spy gear he was installing and deliberately did not tell you, that's a red flag. I would discreetly cover the device from further filming, check for anything else that may be hidden and sit down with yourself and review how you'll tall to him about it because this definetly needs to be discussed. At the very LEAST, he doesn't trust your current living situstion."
Right!? It's like he was being underhanded and sneaky on purpose? But he's never been that way... it's all so odd. 
"&gt;Your parents are really shitty, too.

Yes, Laura is an asshole and a toxic nightmare, but she's just OP's sister. She has no duty of care toward OP. But OP's *parents*, the people who had the highest legal and moral duty to take care of her and protect her, allowed her sister to turn OP's home into a place she couldn't feel safe from any early age. That's, frankly, unforgivable."
"**Yes - this.**

“It was just a joke!” or “Stop being so uptight” are common defenses once this type of person is confronted with their inappropriate behavior and sexual harassment.

Draw a line in the sand that *this is unwanted and not okay.* Speak with your higher-ups immediately."
"This means so much to me.  It's been hard to not think of myself as ""damaged.""  

I'm high functioning: I have two advanced degrees, general emotional stability, a job I love, kind friends, interesting hobbies.  But I worry when I am ready to start dating my past will make potential partners give me a hard pass."
(side note- high five for not having a kid you don't want!)
"You should have kept reading because he also dunked her head in vomit-filled toilets while she was pregnant, put their INFANT into a CABINET and screamed at her that she was missing, and she had a literal contingency plan for her daughter's care in case he killed her.

This is one of the most severe and sickening cases of abuse I've ever read. This man needs to be locked up far away from society."
"So your ED-afflicted husband said you basically weren't attractive enough for him to get an erection...and *you* end up apologizing?!

Look, ED is embarrassing and emasculating to talk about, and I could understand why he might get defensive or try and deflect what he is feeling as criticism. But there's no excuse to talk to his wife like that.

Many things could be contributing to his ED: hormonal changes, health issues, change in medicine, stress, depression, anxiety, etc. But rather admit that he's got an issue that needs solving, he uses it as a chance to insult you. In your shoes I'd be reevaluating the marriage with someone like that."
"okay, so, I'm attracted to girls with small boobs. I have big boobs. 

I've lost half a stone recently and my boobs look a bit smaller. I was looking in the mirror and going ""noooo, my boobs have shrunk! They look so small, this sucks!"". But...on other women, I prefer their boobs to be much smaller than my own. 

The point I'm making is - people have different standards for their own bodies vs. other people's bodies. 

Also, remember that aswell as different preferences - people have different shapes!

My best friend has teeny tiny stick legs. Like, she just doesn't carry weight there at all. We're about the same size/shape on top, but I have a big butt and rounded thighs. If she puts weight on and complains about her legs, that's not her saying that she thinks MY legs are fat because they're still bigger than hers. It's her saying ""my legs are bigger than they usually are and that's bad because it means I'm getting above my personal happy weight""......but it's easier to just say ""urgh, I feel fat."""
"you said no, and he did it anyway. That's all I'm taking from this. If this was another sexual act such as actual sex, it would be just as bad. "

"Oh, this reminds me of a School of Life Video about how we don't want to feel stereotyped in our relationships. Because deep down we all know we can change, but on our own accord, yet often feel restrained by our loved ones, especially when they say things like  “that's not you, you wouldn't like that“. 

So, yeah, she may be curious, so it wouldn't hurt to be open and ask her whether she would like to try something similar. "
"Another angle: have you guys talked about getting married in the near future? If that is the case, he might be thinking ""she didn't respect marriage back then, will she respect it if we get married?"""
"The third option is that he starts doing whatever it was she needed him to do, and then she gets even more upset because clearly he was capable of (walking the dog/ going to work/ being nice to her) the whole time, but it just wasn't worth his effort until she was ready to leave. "
"Changing/stopping medications can sometimes really mess with people, but honestly, it almost sounds like she's depressed and the BC was somehow masking it, or maybe she was taking something else as well and she stopped.

The lack of motivation (including not wanting to eat, I never want to eat when I'm going thru a depressive episode), sleeping issues, and even anger are legit symptoms of depression. I can understand wanting to leave her, but even if you break up with her, definitely suggest she sees her doctor."
"I love that the wife asked the sister to leave her own home and husband to watch the children, implied  the brother in law is a pervert, and keeps doubling down on “it’s the policy” like this is an actual law or legally binding agreement instead of an arbitrary decision, and it’s the sister who’s petty.

My guess?  It’s going to be the father in law who’s next on the chopping block.  Because the wife sounds exactly like my own controlling helicopter mom who systematically cut every one from my dad’s family of whom she disapproved (hint:  it was most of them) from our lives.

By the time I was 15, I loathed her and was counting down the minutes until I turned 18.  I consider her early death when I was 16 as the best thing that ever happened to me.  Even then, years of isolation had let me so socially stunted, I was close to a decade behind my peers in  my knowledge of how the world works.

And I was so angered at my father for allowing it, for not fighting for me, I never had anything beyond a cordial relationship after her death, and after graduation, rarely spent more than a couple of hours a time in his presence.  "
I think both of you are vastly overreacting on this. It seems to me to be a perfectly normal comment to leave. I don't get the feeling of insecurity that your gf's experiencing.
"Personally, I do think you're being a bit harsh. It's difficult to balance a marriage and a family. From an outside perspective, they clearly love you and worked hard to give you the best opportunities in life. You guys had family dinner every night -- shitty parents don't do that. I don't think they're wrong for also prioritizing time together as a couple, but I'm also not saying their behavior was perfect either. I agree with them that parents do need a break sometimes, and I don't think being a good parents means abandoning your spouse or your adult friends. 

You and your sister are at the age where people begin to see their parents as adults, not just ""mom and dad"", and that includes recognizing they are also flawed. Perhaps you guys can plan some family activities and see if you can rekindle your relationship on a new level if that's what you want. 

For what it's worth, my father wasn't the ""I live to be a Dad"" sort of guy either, but once I became an adult we had the absolute best relationship. I think he just related more to adults than children. My life was absolutely enriched and I wouldn't trade the time we had together for anything. 

I just wouldn't want you or your sister to miss out on a potentially brand-new relationship with them for punitive reasons. I think if they didn't care about you and only spent time with you out of ""obligation"" they would absolutely be content to only see you on holiday's and birthday's, but that's not the case. 

&gt;Thank God for college because their love was suffocating us.

So...they only spent time with you out of ""obligation"", but their love was so suffocating you couldn't wait to leave and never talk to them? Those are contradictory statements -- which is it? 

Obviously you feel the way you feel, but I do think you guys are being a little immature here."
"&gt; Your husband turned out ok because he’s a man.

I disagree. Typically sexist women raise equally if not more sexist sons. Plenty of my patients go through these problems and only start to recognize them late into adulthood. I don’t quite know what happened with my husband for him to have strayed away from his mother’s views, but I have a feeling his having gone to boarding school and then away for uni had a lot to do with it.

"You are not a bad guy at all.  Please know that if you do break up with her, you are NOT the bad guy.  I don’t know one guy that would have dated your girlfriend for three years without sex.  You have natural human need for intimacy and you should not feel bad for having them.  

Your girlfriend needs therapy now.  Can she go to a clinic that has a pay scale?  She should look into it.  She needs to stop procrastinating because she’s suffering severe PTSD.  

Just know no matter what you do, you are not a bad guy.  I’m a girl and I don’t think I could have stayed the three years unless it was an open relationship.  But you need to do what’s best for you."
and you would literally not pay up if you lose
"I mean the first step is to lay it all out for her. She changed, you're unhappy, and things have to change. If she doesn't want to change then you can't continue the relationship.

That's such a huge change in dynamics. I couldn't be with someone who isn't self disciplined enough to eat."
"So I’m gunna go against he grain and say that I’m also 25F and wouldn’t give a fuck about this. His reaction and pretty obvious lying about it would bother me more than him looking at the photos. But we honestly would have never gotten into that whole back and forth, because I just don’t really get the whole objection. If the stuff about porn or nude photos is a boundary for you, then it’s worth it to state and explain explicitly. Clearly, you aren’t alone in feeling the way you do. So if you approach the conversation calmly and maturely, it shouldn’t be too difficult to resolve. "
"Ok, to be honest...instead of worrying about him asking her to leave this motorcycle group I’m more worried why you are in a relationship build on a big lie from the very beginning in the first place. You guys don’t have a very solid foundation and he’s already displayed a few big red flags....good luck! "
"I think she realizes that she’s clingy at times, so just throws a just kidding in there so you don’t judge her and hoping it plays out more like a joke rather than her being insecure. 

I used to do this when I’d get irritated about something, then realized it was dumb to get irked by that and throw a just kidding in there because I realized my mistake. It stems from insecurities. "
"&gt;guess I was blind to the fact he works very long hours and usually doesn't have a shower as he feels he will get instantly dirty the next day.

Gross. That is gross. 

I would thrown a screaming fit after one DAY of the boiler being broken. If this is how he is, I would move out and break up now before wasting too much time. "
"Yes, he may not be physically forcing you, but he is emotionally forcing you through manipulation. Who knows how this behavior may escalate as your relationship goes on, perhaps eventually leading to physical aggression?"
"Avoid them. Just know that right now they’re just big fish in a small pond and their misogyny will hit them hard in the face when they’re out working in the real world without their little buddies to giggle at their bullshit. Just seriously zero him and them out of your life. 

If you need a parting shot, tell him he exhibits the same attitudes as most middle-aged creeps on any given sex offender registry. Because it’s true."
"So your girlfriend is a racist, who makes actively deteriorates your self- esteem, you can't set borders with her (something you should be sitting down with a therapist to discuss), her father lives with you in an apartment and she does nothing to remedy the problems she complains about. Yeah, this isn't a sustainable relationship. "
"People like you are the reason I just say bless you if I can't tell and take the risk 😂! ""That was just a cough"", okay fine lol."
"You were ready to throw an axe at somebody's face, now you get all worked up when it was done to you.

Do you at least see now how horrible your idea was in the first place? "
"You’ve already gotten some amazing advice, and definitely heed the amazing suggestions! But one thing I wanted to note. My cousin is a labor and delivery nurse, and I recently asked her to tell me why I should consider a natural birth instead of a c-section, should I be in a position where I can actually do natural birth(I was afraid of the idea of vaginal tearing so the notion of opting for c-section was appealing). 


She explained to me that when a woman has a c-section, they have to essentially detach the abdominal muscles to get to the baby, then reattach then after (or something to that similar effect, I’m not in the medical field, rather the mental health field). While that’s fine, what it means is that the abdominal muscles and associated areas never really function as well ever again, and lose much of the ability to re-tone the area after that operation. Basically, no matter how much a woman works out, eats right, etc. they will never be able to fully get that smooth toned appearance they once had, but will have more of a pouch of skin/fat which stays in the area. This made a world of sense to me, as despite my mother’s best attempts for 36 hours at a natural birth, she ended up requiring a c-section. My mother was always petite, 104 lbs, and she did get close to back to that weight after giving birth for a long time (110 lbs for many years after), but she was never able to return her stomach to the way it was before. 


My point to telling you this is that you should not expect that your wife’s stomach will return to that toned one as before. In order to get that back, it would require plastic surgery, which is absolutely an option, but I just want you to have a realistic expectation so when you both hit the gym hard, and you don’t see her stomach changing, you’ll know why!"
"I think you may be over interpreting your friends reaction here. Seems to me like they'd recommend marriage here whoever your boyfriend is.

They're right too.

You seem to think getting married is about a big party and fairytales. It's not. It's a solid legal arrangement that turns you and your boyfriend from legal strangers into next of kin. With a kid in the mix it's eminently sensible to do it right away.

You plan to get married anyway, the legal protections are worth having once you're pregnant. Delaying has a lot of potential downside."
"I find that most people who say ""no one will be nice to you"" say it because they don't want to be nice to you. "
"Yeah reading these comments I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.

I am a huge stoner. I would not be offended if someone asked me not to smoke during a wedding...

I also wouldn't want the smell of weed or people publicly smoking during my wedding. I'm totally going to be high for my wedding, but I don't want my wedding pictures full of people with joints."
"This is bizarre; there's a lot to unpack here.

First: 

&gt;The only issue so far has been that he often believes he knows more than I do about.. Most things

Red flag. You guys are only 3 years apart in age, so this could be:
A.) he just assumes everyone is less intelligent than him
B.) it's a gender thing
C.) It's a thing with *you specifically*
D.) He thinks he's so much more mature because of a 3 year age difference (gimme a break, dude)
E.) Some combination of the above

None of these options are that great.

Second: 

&gt;he obviously didn't believe me. It was pretty weird between us after this, so I actually went home and didn't stay the night - it was just so bizarre.

This is so, so weird. Truly. The word ""bizarre"" is really well used here; I can't think of what else to call this. This could be indicative of trust issues on his side, but more likely, I think he read up about self harm before speaking to you. When I went to talk to my friend about her (real) self harm issues, I read up about it first and most resources online say that the person might try to deny it. This brings me to...

Third:

He obviously cares about you. This is an extremely low bar for a boyfriend, but it's still worth noting. This guy cares about you, and your mental/physical health enough to put himself in an awkward situation about it.

Fourth:

Why doesn't he know what eczema looks like? There's ads for eczema meds on tv all the time? Whatever, this is not the most important issue here.

My take:

I think you ought to tell him that you appreciate his concern, but that this is just a skin condition you have. I do NOT think you should ""bring him to a doctor's appointment"" with you; you don't have to prove anything to him. Have an honest conversation with him about why he doesn't believe you - ask him straight up ""why don't you believe me?""

I think that you can salvage this relationship if you want, but I also think you should have a talk with him about thinking he's right all the time.

Good luck!"
"Well the apology wasn’t genuine...so it’s understandable he didn’t jump to accept it. 

Does your older son lie about his childhood to get attention? You mention that your younger son thinks this, but is it true?  If not...I see where your older son is coming from. 

For what it’s worth, I think you’re overly involved in a spat between siblings and you’re just to make it worse.  Forcing them to make up isn’t going to work. They’re adults."
"Canadian here, had a wedding five years ago and a similar clashing of family values. We just asked the family members that were into it to be discrete. Still, the conservative parents ran into the weed smoking parents mid-joint outside the venue. It didn't really matter and everyone moved on. In hindsight, I wish I hadn't even tried to control anyone. Let people be who they are. It's not on you to control anyone's beliefs and people choose when and why to make anything an issue. If they value your wedding more than imposing their beliefs on others, they'll let it slide and not turn it into an issue, just like the situation I outlined above. I think maybe it opened some people's eyes about what's normal outside of their own sphere of influence."
"&gt;  She said that she gets frustrated with me a lot lately when I blow things off and that she didn't mean to hit me, it just happened. She promised never to do it again and doesn't expect me to forgive her.

I grew up in an abusive family too.

Don't tolerate abusive partners.  Not even once.  Your honest explanation and continued driving of her home was more than she deserved."
"Having a child isn't any kind of guarantee of a ""buddy"". A child is not a built-in best friend just because it shares some of your dna. If you raise it right, it will be independent. It could disagree with you fundamentally on values, or move to another country and you would still be alone. 

What you need is friends. You should figure out how to grow as a person and make some.

"
"Definitely this. I’m not surprised he had no idea something was wrong and he didn’t notice: if he’s never had a meaningful conversation with his own son in 28 years, I can’t imagine he was a lot different with OP’s mom either. If OP is capable of having meaningful conversations and open communication, it’s really unlikely he will have any sort of similar situation of being blindsided. I believe OP’s dad was surprised/blindsided by the divorce, but I’m sure OP’s mom has more than enough to say of what got her to that point."
"Yep, I agree! Just make it clear how grateful you are. OP, she clearly wants you to enjoy your trip, and as you age $500 is less money than it probably seems like it is now."
Then don’t go with him lol
"You mention a lot of red flags about this guy. Two years in and he's evasive about basic information (friends, personal plans etc.), he participates in his parents' attempts to arrange a marriage for him and he's cruel when he's angry. I think you should break up with him, enjoy the rest of your time in the US and then move home."
"&gt;These guys are days away from raping somebody

Seriously, I started getting flashbacks to the frat boys that are portrayed on Law and Order: SVU. Genuinely made me queasy and feel unsafe and I'm presumably 300 something miles away from wherever this is. I really hope OP is taking the whole 'distancing' herself thing seriously."
No offense but yeah regular tanning bed use will fuck up your skin fast and make you look older.
"I don't think you're an asshole necessarily. You've stayed with her for two months after her loss, so you're not abandoning her right immediately afterwards. I think you should consider if there's any big stuff coming up in her life in the immediate future. For example, is she a student with exams coming up next month? If so, wait until after the exams. But if there's nothing of that nature in the next month or so, you might as well just break up with her now. Do it kindly. Don't say it's because she's such a bummer now that her dad is dead or anything cruel like that. Find another thing to attribute it to, as dinosaur\_train suggests. 

But I am curious about something. Are you just unhappy because supporting a grieving partner is hard? Or is there an underlying compatibility, something that made you unhappy in the relationship before her dad died? Because if the only reason you want to leave is because you can't handle being in a relationship with someone who is grieving, I think you should work on yourself. Being in a relationship means that supporting your partner through the death of a loved one is an inevitability, because everyone dies at some point. It's not like you're going to be able to find a girlfriend with immortal parents next time. And one day you'll need that support, too. Just something to think about. "
"&gt; My husband sided with her and said if you keep making problems she will go back to india. 

Cool. Great. Problems it is. 

I understand that this is a cultural thing. I’ve also known enough Indian women to know that they *also* hate it. If divorce was easier and less stigmatized, this practice of “MIL runs DIL’s entire life while she’s in the house” would result in a lot more of them. Don’t put up with this because you feel it would be insensitive not to. Your husband certainly isn’t too concerned about *your* feelings here."
"One month later? Yeah, don't know about this one."
"Yeah, on one hand, OP is too timid about expressing her feelings. On the other hand, she spent emotional effort going through the scenario and came to the conclusion that 1) they idea has no appeal to her and 2) it would hurt her and the relationship if they go through with it.

So, u/Throwaway4262162928, I'm glad you took the time to go through this and realise this isn't something you want. The next step is to tell your boyfriend this, in completely unambiguous terms, that is ""I do not want it"". After that you will know how much he cares about your feelings from what he says and does."

"""Aunt/ Relative, it is cousin who stopped talking to me without telling me why. Not a single person has told me why he stopped talking to me, so I have no way of addressing it with him, and no way of correcting it. I have tried several times to reach out to discuss, and I've been rejected every time. The ball is in his court. If you would like to come to me like an adult, and have a discussion, I'm all ears. Until then, I'm going to live my life as I see fit, and he's going to have to manage his emotions on his own. He's a grown adult. After learning about autism, I learned that autism does not mean that you play Silent Treatment games, or you treat your relatives poorly. Individuals with autism are fully capable of having adult conversations, discussing their problems clearly, and working out their problems with other adults. Anytime he would like to do these things, I'm willing to listen. Until then, I wish him all the best, he's welcome to avoid me as much as he likes, but I will not be changing my life in any way shape or form for a person who won't even tell me why I'm expected to change. This is the end of the discussion forever, I won't be entertaining your request again."""

"Imo ""sweet talking"" or ""asking for a favor"" is coersion and it's abuse. I did a lot of things for my ex because he complemented me and made me feel guilty if I tried to say no. Overall, my relationship with him was toxic and emotionally abusive. I don't want that to happen to anyone else."

"I'm also the ""healthy one"" between me and my younger sister, and this post was super relatable. My parents also let my sister get away with everything, and expected me to accommodate her, and it basically sucked until I moved out.

Luckily you're an adult, and can now set your own boundaries!

First and foremost, get yourself into therapy, if at all possible. Your sister's behavior is unacceptable, but the ways in which your parents have enabled your sister and expected you to look the other way are really not okay either*.* Setting boundaries with your family is really hard though, and you deserve to be supported through that, ideally by someone who's a professional. 

Therapy has helped me SO much, with figuring out what kind of relationship is healthy for me to have with my sister (for me, minimal), mourning the relationship I *wish* I had with my sister, and managing my expectations re: how I wish my parents would act vs how they actually act. At a certain point, I had to accept that they weren't going to be the perfect parents I wanted them to be, and look for unconditional support elsewhere (friends, other family members, again - therapy - and whatnot). it is hard though! and sad! And now we fight a lot less, because I just have lower expectations for them. I still love them and think they're doing their best, but like, they're not *that* good at it, if that makes sense.

Also! I'm in a facebook support group for siblings of disabled people, and it's been a godsend for me -- if you're on facebook, look up ""Sib20,"" or look for something similar in your community. Seeing other people going through similar things and having all the mixed feelings of ""they're my sib and i'm worried about them and i love them but i also wish they never existed and they're ruining my life"" has helped me stop feeling so much like the World's Worst Sister because I don't want to put myself through my sister's toxicity. it turns out this is not an uncommon situation, and talking to other people who have been there can help a lot."
"Yeah, I think so too. It makes me upset with myself because I'm upset about this but he did a selfless thing when he chose to take care of another person's child. "
"I think what Dfahz is saying is that there is nothing to ""make up"" to Lupe because you haven't done anything wrong.

Move on and focus on you. You already offered him help and he refused it. If you keep trying to help him and eventually he takes it he will just throw it in your face later. 
"As soon as possible. If she *isn't* vaccinated, it's a multi-month process as she will need to get 3 shots.

And you're not hearing about the couples who could not make it work, who couldn't deal with allergy pills every day for the rest of their lives, whose allergies did NOT just fade away over time, and who couldn't afford the shots or the shots didn't work. 

This isn't a fairytale that sorts itself out each time. People break up over this. People don't want to feel like they have a cold and hives every day. People value their health over their partners sometimes indeed. You're asking him to ""just"" take pills every day or ""just"" get needles for months or years that might not work enough for him. There's no ""just"" about it. This is not a tiny little cute compromise. This is him feeling like shit for a very long time or forever in your place with cats. 

He's made his line clear. He's not wrong. Neither are you for keeping your pets.

"I think a lot of people on here are talking about this as a drug issue, framing the question from ""is it okay to smoke weed at a wedding"" and then concluding ""it's legal so yes, everyone else needs to just get over it.""

But this isn't /r/trees, this is /r/relationships.

You should instead be framing this as a relationship issue.

This issue could arise with anything, at its core it's not about the drugs, it's about setting boundaries and metering expectations between family, and making sure that you handle a concern one of you has together in a way you're both satisfied with.

It may have to be a compromise, and you should be prepared to accept that."
"Not to be too personal with your situation, since I certainly dont know the whole story, but that begins to sound to me like control issues.
It seems very unfair that he would play both sides of the card like that, you cant blame someone for not being able to provide while simultaneously denying them the freedom to do so by their own means.
If you do start to travel with him and that makes you happy, then by all means I would embrace that reality. But if the issues you are experiencing cause tensions at home, being confined to travel space only exasperated them.
No matter what you decide, I truly advise that you embrace something that will empower you. Being helpless is never fun and being targeted with negativity because you are helpless is even less fun. Make sure you approach whatever lifestyle you choose from this moment knowing that you at least have the power to secure your own safety and contentment.
EMPOWERMENT really is the word I am trying to emphasize here. Dont let anyone take your power or personal sovereignty from you."

"&gt; He thought I was just being self sacrificing by ""not asking for much"" so he wanted the ring to be extra special because I deserve it. 

THIS is the problem...right here.  He thinks he knows what you feel, want and say, better than you do.  That's a MAJOR issue and I doubt this is the first time where he has thought he knows better than you in regards to something for yourself.  HE tried to decide what you ""Deserve"" instead of listening to what you clearly stated you wanted.

I think this is a bigger deal than you are making it because the underlying issue is a massive problem in a relationship.  He thinks he knows better, thinks he can decide things for you, and didn't respect your words/listen to you.  I think this is something you need to unpack in premarital counseling.

"r/stopdrinking is a great resource.  Talk to your doctor about quitting drinking.  Tell your partner that if you're drunk, you want him to turn down sex even if you're consenting in the moment.

He’s not very empathetic."

"Good for you. Plan it *very* carefully, my friend. Abusive partners often will not just let their victims walk away, regardless of whether the abuse is physical or not. Other commenters have provided good resources and tips, so I won’t run through the whole list again, just list a few below


Know where all your important documents are. Maybe even move them so the they are all together and easy to grab in one go on the day you’re leaving. 


Have multiple people there to help you move out. Do not give away the location to where you are moving. Start at the beginning of one of his work shifts and figure out how to unplug or tamper with the cameras so he cannot catch wind of it and come home early to try and stop you. 


Don’t lead on that you’re working with a lawyer until all of your important belongings, and YOURSELF are out of the house safely. In his eyes, everything needs to be good and going as usual. This has to be a surprise. 


Get your pets out of there. Do it first. Send them with a friend and work with the others to move the rest very quickly. Abusers can take out their rage on animals to retaliate against you. They also won’t let you grab the pets as the last thing when you’re walking out. 



Fuck this dude, OP. Best of luck to you. "

"Right now, the easiest solution to ""make peace"" at home for your husband is to make you back down to appease his mom.

You need to become a bigger problem for him than his mom. Otherwise, he'll never learn that appeasing you is also a goal he should strive towards. Stop being accommodating, make your needs known, don't pay attention to his mom, get mad at your husband for not supporting you. You are a new mother, you have other things to worry about than the emotions of your mother in law, and so should your husband. She threatens to leave? Well good! You want her gone, she's negatively affecting your health, and therefore your baby's health, because those are tied right now."

"I am a massage therapist.

I qualified because I wanted to help address mental and physical health (Swedish helps depression and anxiety; deep tissue physical injuries and tension). Bodies are bodies to me, and muscles are muscles - I see them as quirks that I help fix. Many medical healthcare professionals have a similar outlook, and we kinda have to see bodies as engines. So whilst there's separation of a body to the human that inhabits it, it's in order to give them the best possible physical healthcare and to not be emotionally compromised. It is sure as hell not to get our rocks off.

Your partner is choosing his client base on what he finds attractive. He is sexualising clients. He is objectifying them, and touching them in an intimate way with an intent they did not consent to. This is abhorrent to me. This is on the same level as Weinstein to me. He is the type of practitioner that gives the business a bad name. 

Your discomfort is probably because he's not working from a position of care, but of manipulation. This is not healthy. It  profoundly disturbs me reading about it. I cannot imagine spending 5 years with someone who does this. 

Personally, I would consider it cheating, because of his intent behind what is fundamentally an intimate touch, and I would leave. But I would primarily leave because he doesn't respect women, and he doesn't respect the relationship - years of the same behaviour with no change indicates **he sees nothing wrong with sexually touching the person who trusted him to help them**. That is *fucked up*. I'd probably report him as well, if it was safe. I certainly wouldn't want to date someone with these values. 

I'm sorry, OP. Look into sunk cost fallacy. You can date better people than this, and as hard as it could be for you because of 5 years together, I'd still advise doing that. "

"I am into gaming and Esports is just like any other competitive sport. Only the best make money off it and the rest are losers. Its just the reality of competitive sports. To give an estimation, its probably the top 0.01 % that makes a meaningful income.

He is using this as an excuse to play games and not go to work. It is a serious addiction issue that he doesn't want to address. 

Even someone like you who doesn't play the game is able to take more action than him, it shows that he has a serious lack of effort and is not really trying his best on this. Other people are not so lucky to have a gf do it all for them, they do everything by themselves and work their way up. Not saying effort means you will have a successful Esports career but it is a requirement to succeed.

"There is no good reason to spy on you. Ever. If he was concerned about your safety, why did he lie about it? Why didn't he just take you out shopping for a security system? He didn't do that. He put a camera in your bedroom to fucking spy on you. That's fucking insane.

He's defective. Throw him away."
"My guess is that jokes like this are not seen as jokes all the time in her eyes. Some people try to brush off things they feel are criticism but when it gets to be too much, they explode.

"Reading about your friends and neighbor really stung. 

There was one time I wasn’t feeling great but had just won an award at work. We were going to go out to celebrate but I felt too sick. So instead I asked if my celebration could just be him taking Maisy for a walk and then after we could cuddle on the couch and watch some movies with takeaway. He begrudgingly agreed and put her leash on... then took her to the backyard and stood there for a few minutes. I could see him through the window. 
He came in and closed the door really hard (but not quite a slam) and let Maisy go with the leash still on and I had to chase her down to remove it. He went straight to the bedroom after as though he was angry but wouldn’t tell me why or talk to me for quite awhile.
My only guess is he didn’t want to take her out and felt manipulated into it and it pissed him off, so he threw a fit. I don’t count it as a walk. 

But he is rarely EVER like that. Maybe four times in six years he’s acted that way. But it is extremely off-putting to recall because at the time I let him sulk and waited for him to get over it and I ended up being the one babying him to try and salvage the day. But now I feel like that should have been a discussion where I held ground. 

Crap I’m regretting writing this stuff out because more is flooding to the surface and it’s becoming quite clear that my relationship is not as amazing as I’ve thought... this isn’t how I thought my day was going to go. "

It is just another way to show someone you care for them. You could try and kiss her forehead or cheek. Maybe hold her hand. She is lonely.

If your libido really is that high, you will only have misery if you marry her. This is a classic deadbedroom situation that you can avoid by not marrying her.

It sounds like you guys need to have a talk about this.  And curious, how did she find out?

&gt;How do I even bring this up? 

So just say: I have been thinking a bit about the money thing.  I never knew exactly how to bring it up or what to say about it.  I only ever talked to my parents.  I hope you don't feel like I was ""hiding"" anything from you.

Then let her talk about it.  Talk this part through.

Then bring up, ""one of my fears was always people would treat me differently because of my money.  I know you are joking but stuff like the ""ATM comment"" really makes me insecure.""

So something along those lines."
"&gt; We've discussed this many many many times and he doesn't understand me because that is, ""not how he operates.""

Funny. *You* seem to be able to understand *his* point of view just fine, even if his approach to working out isn't how *you* operate.

It's almost like he's intentionally choosing to be dismissive of your choices and values!

&gt; He'll make comments like, ""I don't see your biceps this pic,"" or point to my stomach and say, ""what is this.""

...so he's a bit of an insensitive asshole too?

&gt; Yet he plays video games all day, gyms the morning, skips class, barely studies, has clothes everywhere, and I have to consistently ask him to put his things away or throw things out.

...*and* he's a hypocrite, a slob, and at 26yo is still skipping classes to play video games?

&gt; The things that upsets me is that I've spoken to him about all these points before and I'm stuck.

...and to top it off, you've even tried talking about this before, and he just doesn't give a shit.

**Throw away this garbage person.**"
"I came here to say this. most abuse is by a family member or by someone you trust.

i mean if they looked sketchy you wouldn't let them watch your kids right? youd take steps.

it's always the person you least suspect because if you suspected them you didn't give them the chance."
"If I had 500k saved, my friends had been there for me in the past, they were now struggeling I would not mind spending a bit of coin on them when I  got successful. Idk what her friends did, but I would at least consider that they were part in her making it to success if they helped her out of depression.

It also does not seem like there is no guilttripping Going on. So then your gf have the choice, if she want to do fancy/fun things with her friends she need to pay, because they dont have that kind of money.

I would honestly stay out of this if I were you. Your gf seem to have her finances in order, and a few grand on your friends throughout a year is not a lot for people with that kind of money. If you were married and had shared finances you should have a say on where money goes, but in this case I dont really feel you do in this case."
That does seem like the limit for number of texts unresponded to. If he wants to contact you he will.
"Well, it’s one thing if she just brought a coworker along( they probably went to lunch together and swung by the house). It’s an entirely different situation if the “snooped” in which case, I’m
Not sure why you are fixating on M being there when C is just as guilty. I’d probably let it go and just dont ask again. You do have to work with these people."
"Right?! What the actual fuck? Inviting her mother?! A speech about forgiveness?! All wrapped up in a fucking proposal?! OP do you even know this dude at all? Who the actual fuck does he think he is? Im sorry, im actually astounded by his plan. If i knew how to reddit there would be far more italicized words."
"So much this. I feel like too many people don’t realize that appearances change, so if that’s all you’re attracted to in a person, you’re going to be in for a big surprise. 

Building attraction that goes beyond just the physical is important when you’re planning to spend the rest of your lives together."
These people are disgusting 
"Just be gracious and take pictures to share with her afterwards.

$500 is a small amount of money compared to ""been to Italy 5+ times"""
"What he did was awful. It sounds like he knew your intentions with the money, and why it meant so much. It’s a blatant disregard for your feelings. If he was concerned about affording the tires it should have been a conversation before just taking the money. 

I’d be less concerned about the money and more focused on what an insensitive, entitled jerk he was. 

Also, not his money. "
"Also pinktruth, it's specifically about Mary Kay. "
"I don't think it's *as* bad as it seemed by the title, since he expected and enabled you to do the same thing. 

I agree that it's not funny, but it seems more along the lines of a failed joke attempt by someone who considers himself funnier than he is. 

I'm going to call you out a bit here - the fact that you haven't discussed it for a week is some strong supporting evidence for the way you mention ""communication is part of our problems"". I can see wanting to avoid a fight, but can't you tell him it was more hurtful to you than funny, at least? You mention your relationship issues don't involve fighting or anger..."
"You gave someone 15k but couldnt talk to your girlfriend of 4 years about having wealth?  Wouldnt your wealth potentially get our there anyways if you're making decisions like that?  Money holds a lot of power and I'd probably be resentful too.  Maybe the jokes are passive aggressive because she feels like youd be willing to bail someone out in trouble but cant trust your loved one to not lie by omission? Maybe she figured if you dont trust her, might as well joke about how you perceive her (because I cant imagine after 3 years someone who has gold digging tendencies his them I mean cmon OP, if you dont know her by now suddenly dont trust her just break up.  If you're hesitating maybe part of you realizes that this dynamic was created by your silence versus her sudden ""poor character""?"
"Explain to her that consent means that it's not abuse. You're not scared, you're not abused, you're a confident woman who can make up her own mind. You like this relationship and the marks are passion marks, not abuse marks.

Don't approach this from a pleading standpoint; state unequivocally that this is consensual. He does not threaten you, he does not manipulate you, he does not frighten you, he does not belittle you, he does not minimize your thoughts and feelings. You like what he does in bed, and that's your decision because its your body. In other words, you become the anti-victim.

Let your BF know this may be an issue. He deserves to know before school officials / cops show up at his door."
"Wow. Please don't have kids.

Child: God night, Daddy! See you in the morning!

OP: Well...hopefully. I mean, it's my intention to see you in the morning, but anything can happen. I could drop dead, or someone could sneak in the house in the middle of the night and kidnap you. But I really hope I won't be putting up ""Missing"" flyers for you tomorrow, honey. Sleep well!"
"I'm a nice guy, I've never been pepper sprayed by a woman once. It sounds like your husband has been peppered sprayed on more than one occasion..."
"The fact that he took the time out of his day to put the photos in a folder shows that it might be more than a drunken act. 

He didn’t ask for your consent which is 100% unacceptable drunk or not. I cant imagine how you feel. It’s still bothering you so this is a conversation that should happen again. 

Believe it or not this is an actual fetish for some people. The problem is him not asking you first and keeping the photos. To me there’s a possibility he’s being dishonest. 

"
what do you have to make up? You told her you had to hear back from a few other people.. How does she know the your other cousin wasn't one of those people? Just go with the idea that other cousin asked first if people start asking too many questions.
"It seems like you want her to be SO in love with you that her life plan doesn't matter to her anymore. That's not how love works--love builds when we achieve goals together, and if one of those goals is to build a family together, what's wrong with that? If you guys don't share goals then it's best to know ASAP. Your girlfriend is being mature and, frankly, considerate to you. If she waited another two years and then realized that you had ruined her life plan, and now she was resentful, do you think that would be fun for you? If you don't want the life she wants, be honest. You're 26, so surely you have some idea. "
Dont watch porn at all. You're projecting the porn body expectations onto your wife.
