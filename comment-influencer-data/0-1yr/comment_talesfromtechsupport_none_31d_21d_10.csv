"&gt; Clearly you don't. 

That smugness... I like you. A fucking lot."
"Your statement is rather confusing. What makes you think that thermite is a ""fairly high powered explosive""? Thermite is an effective incendiary compound, but by no stretch of the imagination an explosive."
"You made the mistake of assuming an end user could change the paper on their own and would bother opening a ticket if they could.

It happens to all of us."
Lets be honest. The other reason is so you can see pictures of what people did to their computers for laugh.
"Soulless corporate drones unable to identify ""Hoo-man festivities""?"
"Weeeeellll, yes, it's barracuda, enough said."
"the greatest satisfaction I've gotten is extremely large quantities of .22 LR

_Extremely_ large quantities."
"Yeah, I just wish the engineering department would lock down all the old laptops so after the warranty goes on them they aren't allowed on the network anymore. Forcing them do come to us to get a new laptop, etc. 

But that be ”mean”   Oy..."
"Soo.. You're a ""bucket O' bullets"" fan..? ;)"
"At a previous job they bought this hard drive shredder.  Looked like some cold war monolith (turn key to start, red and green lights, big red STOP button) that sat in the corner of the datacenter.  I named it 'The Crushinator'.  I'd stack various drives to decommission in a bin.  On shitty days I'd just go toss in a few drives and watch them explode into a 1,000 pieces.  Definitely brightens your day."
You don't happen to have a video of smelting platters do you?
"It was a Teletype Model 33 in the movie.  The paper was between the alarm bell and its clapper.  The guy was supposed to press a button to receive messages when he heard the bell.

In practice, military communication lines get tested regularly to make sure messages are getting through.  The story skates over this."
That's fair. My boss drilled into me that we couldn't crack passwords without some proof of ownership. Profile name was a big one.
"This is an awesome story, but please don't do this in the future; not only does it create huge liability issues for the store, it may very well have been a felony.

But you get the updoot anyway."
"This indeed.

Could hosting is no different than any other form of hosting.  Your public accessibility can be as little or as much as you like.

This is both a gift and a curse at times, because unlike hosting your own server, you usually have to specifically *deny* access to an instance as opposed to having to allow it through your DC firewall.

Though in this sort of situation I would probably be going for public access backed by certificate and 2FA, that way you can ensure its only accessible from legitimate devices and you won't get people logging in from their personal machines and the like."
"Probably, but if the user account name matched his name then it would probably be safe, and technically this guy had access to all the main user account data well before I fixed the problem.

After he stormed out I still think this guy had nerd posse fix his old computer forever ago and was just looking for some payday.  Otherwise how would this harebrained story work?  I will agree he could just be an idiotic thief."
Sounds like you stole his Righteous Indignation from right out under him. :D
i agree. It sounds to me like they understand it and have a philosophical disagreement with it
I got to around 9:03. I figured it was the oft-repeated story of this issue honestly happening (bad driver causing the machine to spit out pages of garbage) and paper being placed back in the tray for reuse.
"I think I am agreeing with you. Most of the time when I compress it's for speedier file transfer, not for storage. And I usually use the built-in compress like you say.

I often have to transfer Access databases and they compress well, as do some PDFs. Some of my Excel files have a huge amount of coffee in them but not much data, so they would compress well, but I usually use the xlsb format for those which stores the workbook on s compressed format anyway."
The Dilbert Principle.
Surely you can't be cirrus?
The problem is your loaner.  A propper loaner looks like a dog chewed it up and always needs to be plugged into a car battery using a custom duck tape cable because it is actually not capable of using the wall adapter any more.
"Multi-function printer, but yours is the more informal way of addressing them"
"No one looked at the paper. They thought they had it all figured out and ""knew"" what the issue was. No one asked for images of the paper. No one looked at the paper itself. No one did basic troubleshooting. They all tried to be clever and forgot the basic troubleshooting steps. 

I was the only one who saw the paper who tried to help. The c suite person literally said. ""Funny characters."""
The mouse can be used while it's charging when the cable is plugged into the computer. It basically becomes a wired mouse.
Also works for optical fiber. If a signal is being sent from one end turn on your phone camera and you'll be able to see the light coming out the other.
"It was intended to be a joke, sarcastically pointing out that it’s way to easy to buy guns in my home state of Virginia"
Bonus points if it was a colour design on a black-and-white printer.
"Trying to pry old tech out of people's hands...

I would rather have keyhole surgery on my scrotum via catapult"
"I'm pretty sure you can't be held responsible for ""acts of God.""

Unless, of course, you were deliberately provoking him."
"&gt; easier to get a hold of then a gun

Depends where in the world you live."
"Had a manager that some how got a hold of an old laptop and gave it to a user that was going to be out of the office for a while. First it did not work because it was already kicked out of the domain because it had not been used in about 6 months. I was ordered to get it running for the user. When it got back to the office a few weeks later I asked for it back. They were already trying to wiggle more use out of the old 7 year old laptop and asking where I was going to put it. As soon as I got my hands on it I broke it over my knee. 

We will issue you a newer laptop if you need one in the future."
"I can schedule shutdowns and reboots of our Ubuntu workstations using Landscape, but not repeating ones. That may get tested tomorrow if the usual suspects continue to ignore my requests to reboot for kernel updates..."
"Nope: me, too."
Especially with green tip 5.56 or similar. We made some holes recently.
Welcome to the UK
I was a motorcycle mechanic for a while. This happens all the time. You did an oil change 2weeks ago and now the brake lights stopped working!!!
"My loaners are Chromebooks.

White to move."
"Ya I think that's a valid question.

I have azure ad customers that do not want employees logging in from home or remote locations.  We restrict things down by site and ip.

I can understand there on-site it not wanting a user to not be able to use the product from anywhere."
"""ah, you won't sign off on that? Without that, we're going to disallow this machine on the campus networks.""

*good luck with your brick*"
One would say it's a bit cumulus.
"&gt; The manager actually kind of got annoyed with me and asked me to not touch customers computers if I’m not working for the store 

I agree with the manager.  I could understand if you offered to look at it real quick and the ranter said okay, but you just barged in and did it. Know you didn't mean any harm, but you were out of place to do that at their place."
