"It's not ""biological knowledge"" to understand damaged body parts. That's like saying it's ignorant not to know everything about every other religion/culture on the planet."
"Dang, well is there any chance that I will ever able to talk to her?"
"webcam... OR if your able to, find new girlfriend more compatible."
Jack the beanstalk and let the seeds scatter on her leg or back.
"Very low chance, but I could ask why, or add a ""pretty please with a cherry on top""

If it's still no gotta do something do get the horniness away, like playing some games, taking care of my beard."
It's a tiny little cotton thread.. no one is sensitive enough to feel that
"&gt; He doesn't want to date while dealing with depression

If people with depression state ""I don't want to date while dealing with this"", and you have a crush on them, get the fuck out. Please. 

Respect what he said there, for both your sakes. There's so many reasons for this, some subtle some not so much. First of all, he deals with it and doesn't feel like he can date: It will be a shitshow. There will be more comments of yours that somebody w/o depression would brush off but he won't sometimes. And this ""sometimes"" will be inconsistent as fuck. Second, you're not going to fix him by being awesome; I don't assume this but some girls like the idea and they can fuck off. Third, if you ignore his stated wishes but he isn't sincere about them, you only teach him that this method (""I am so depressed I don't wanna date"") works, for the future. This will fuck people up, including him.

Just to make this absolutely clear: currently, you don't respect him.  Your bullshit ""you look small compared to other guys"" is just the tip of an iceberg you should go explore.

It was a dumb fucking thing to say. So just tell him that, maybe? And then let it be and let him go.

Reddit armchair psychology session is over."
Depends on the chick tbh
"Cant have fear/anxiety if you never go. I still haven’t gone to see if I can have kids or not. But I was in a relationship for 7 years and always pulled out. Now, I was either the champion of pulling out or I just cant have kids. I never nutted inside so I don’t know for sure."
First year of grad school and you’re having a kid? Terrible choice.
Suck the virus out of me
Wait what? I thought they were the same people.
