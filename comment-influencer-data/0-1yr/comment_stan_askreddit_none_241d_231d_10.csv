"Nothing takes me completely out of a movie like that scream.  It's like a San Lee cameo.  It started out as something fun that only a few people would recognize hidden in a movie, and now it's so common it just feels obligatory (the scream, not Stan Lee cameos, I always enjoy a good Stan Lee cameo)."
"I'm actually watching the episode of *American Dad!* where it is revealed that &gt;!Stan Smith is a 'killing virgin'; he has never killed anyone!&lt;! So in the very specific context of this episode, I think I'm safe!! 

Otherwise, I don't think I could really hide from Stan Smith. Maybe go to a number of hippie concerts, surrounded by throngs of liberals. If I can't hide, I can at least put myself very much in the public eye &amp; semi-camouflage myself in crowds."
