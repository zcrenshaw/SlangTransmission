"I don't really know why you wouldn't be trying dating apps, because that's the obvious answer. Hinge allows you to choose what ethnicities to see, and okcupid lets you do ethnicity-specific searches. I'm sure you would, but just be sure to stress your education in your bio, both in citing degrees and in demonstrating through pure intellect in your writing that you're cerebral."
"Would definitely take this advice on researching even before you're here. I've been ""researching"" new apartments, even though my current lease doesn't end until June, and have learned a lot about what I want for my next place.

If you're not from around here, I would familiarize yourself with the boroughs and see what interests you. And even if you are familiar with NYC, it definitely helps a lot to look at what's out there and figure out where your priorities lie. My BF and I sacrificed a washer/dryer in the building for a prime Brooklyn location and we are really regretting that now.

We paid a month's rent for our broker's fee and even that seems like a ton. 15% seriously sounds like a crime. Definitely take that into consideration too.

I think you'll be good with a full week off plus some time now to browse and learn. Good luck!"
"I've some a couple Metal and punk bands I really like there. Luckily, I think those shows attract better crowds than the normal visitors of the establishment. 

I'm assuming Bowery Presents bought it? They run everything that books shit I want to see. Although I hope they don't turn it into another Terminal 5 or Brooklyn Steel."
Thank you!!!
Orgies downstairs. 
"FIOS.  LPT: when your teaser rate expires, call them up and tell them what their competitor(s) will charge if you switch.  They will probably give you back the teaser rate, or something close to it.  It's annoying, and you need to be prepared to spend an hour or so on the phone, but it works."
"If you're interested in Sanders' type of politics, what about looking to get involved with your local Our Revolution chapter?  In Queens, they're the New Queens Democrats: https://ourrevolution.com/groups/new-queens-democrats/

Their Micheladas also come in mason jars. Suspect but hipster. On that note is there even a good burrito joint in Brooklyn nowadays?
"Not sure about laundry, but DiFara is the best pizza in the city."
Mcondo tacos off the grand stop in Williamsburg has a fantastic one 
"Depends, what is your budget and are you okay with roommates? If roommates are okay then probably a week would suffice. If no roommates then you'd probably want a month to look. "
"Huh, didn't even realized they had closed! Glad they are opening back up. I cried through an entire concert once that I was planning on taking my boyfriend to buuuut he dumped my ass right before the show. I wanted to go though and I'm sure I made lots of people uncomfortable. "
"I went to Del Posto shortly after it received 4 stars from Sifton and had a very disappointing meal. Probably the worst NYT 3/4 star experience I've ever had. Several dishes were oversalted, left one dish practically untouched and no one asked me about it. There were issues with service too but I tend to give service more of a pass. I haven't been back since.

Did love Bouley though."
I was there recently and felt like some of the nicer places in curry hill have similar quality food at a lower price. Although I will say the service and atmosphere was excellent 
"I didn't know Pok Pok had a star, I went there once a couple years back. I thought some of the stuff was pretty creative but yeah, the big price combined with pretty small potions was a turn off"
"Awesome. Good luck! Also, be sure to reserve an elevator and spot for the truck. "
Are they gonna come for free? Can't I just ask the landlord? 
Are there any public playgrounds or other interesting places for kids in UES?
"Um not sure how easy it is to find a furnished apartment. I’d imagine it probably  isn’t to easy . Me personally would rather have an already furnished place though lol. 

With the ac thing most apartments up there will have central air . But obviously some won’t and you would need to buy one . Good luck ! "
"One week +/- a day or two should be good. Once you get started, it’s a remarkably fast process. Just make sure you have all of your personal docs in order to speed up the process. "
Fuck that shitty-ass place. The security there are assholes as well as the dude who ran that shitshow. They were charging 9 bucks for PBRs like ten years ago. I hate that place. Good riddance.
"I play it by ear depending on the time of day / traffic. Sometimes, even when there is a huge backlog of private cars and livery cabs waiting to pickup passengers, the line for yellow cabs is short and there's always a bunch of cabs available immediately for hire. (Yellow cabs have a dedicated lane and can skip the painfully slow backlog of private cars)"
"There are a lot of fun things to do in the cuty — maybe you can pick up running and join a running club or similar for other sports, like rowing, volleyball, etc. Try out climbing. Lots of young professionals are picking up indoor climbing.

Have you tried expanding your social circle? Sometimes dating apps aren’t your lane. Making more platonic friends and setting up group hangouts/potlucks/friendsgivings may lead to something else if you keep it open-invite!"
check with homeless shelters and senior centers
Some live in the area and we’re waiting for amazon
"If you are available during the weekdays before 5pm, there's a lot of open shifts at Rescuing Leftover Cuisine. [https://www.rescuingleftovercuisine.org/calendar](https://www.rescuingleftovercuisine.org/calendar)

Especially on Friday. Basically you pick up food from companies or bakeries that would otherwise have been thrown away and take it to a homeless shelter. Usually the routes are half a mile. "
T&amp;T is gone?!
"Gramercy Tavern. The tasting menu is phenomenal, but the ""tavern"" in the front of the restaurant doesn't take reservations and is excellent too."
Fine we'll class it up and take the bus 
"I’ve been meaning to go there, now it’s a priority "
Why?
"topolobampo in Chicago was pretty super. I haven't been to very many, though."
We want it to be a surprise and don't want to have to choose among our many friends
"I find it weird when “straight” dudes say they don’t like a girl cause of her race . A hot chick is a hot chick . I’m white my girl of the last 4 years is black . I wasn’t interested in her cause she was black I was into her at first cause she was attractive, just happened to be black . 

I don’t know what kind of personality you have but if it’s a unattractive one you’re going to have a hard time no matter what . Good luck "
Have you tried tinder
"Yeah, I don't get OP's point at all, there. In crappy weather, people are less likely to go out for food. I'd think it would be a lot slower when the weather is really nice and people want to go out to eat.


Still makes the delivery job more difficult, and should tip well."
Maybe wait to hear them speaking their language so you can identify it and avoid any offense by making assumptions about what they speak. 
Hispanic in public school. Experienced a lot of racism from mostly black kids. Why? No idea. 
Why would you assume business is slow when it's raining? I would think that means more people ordering delivery.
Which you either pay hilarious sums of money for or sit on a waiting list for a year. 
"Campmor is in Paramus, NJ. It’s a discounter known for their clearance prices, so a little different than a brand showroom, but definitely a famous/destination camping store in the Northeast.

It’s not that easy to get to, so maybe this is a stupid suggestion."
I actually find the area around NY Botanical garden to be pleasant. 
"Most people are using OkC as a swipe app, with very little distinction, at this point."
Also a movie in the works starring Jennifer Lawrence 
"The waiting list is currently over 700,000 people long. "
"I usually say these things at places I go to with my gf who is from Beijing. According to her though, Mandarin and Cantonese are spoken the same but the writing is what’s different. "
"At the time, I was convinced (and shared this with my mugger) that there was no way he'd actually shoot me. Then shortly after this happened, someone got shot &amp; killed in a mugging after reportedly saying ""you're not going to shoot me."" It drove home what a risk I'd taken, and I won't take it again."
I assume $1600 is the preferential rent? Be careful regarding the legal maximum.
I’ve been waking up next to a guy I found off of okcupid for 5 years ago for the last 3 years. Willingly! He hasn’t murdered me yet so I’ll say it’s a success. If it matters I’m a black woman and he’s woefully lacking in the melanin but I love him anyway. 
Yeah the whole borough lol
I work with a bunch of minorities who would have easily gotten one of those high paying jobs. 
Google.
I'll second that with First Fridays at the Brooklyn museum. Always draws a very well dressed and very melanated crowd.
When you smell gas and tell ConEd the Fire Dept will respond and shut off the gas to the stove. You could have a gas leak or the pilot light to the oven part of the stove may be out. 
"Oh, I understand.

Makes sense."
"Dont apologize, i loved it. :) "
Bingo
"Not sure if i just went there on bad nights, but every show I saw in the past few years at Webster hall was filled with teenager-looking NYU douchebags talking/carrying on through the whole performance. I saw Rhye, and Allah Las in 2017 and both shows were completely ruined by the crowed - Did I get unlucky or is this normal?

Milosh was so visibly upset by the crowd that I couldn't bear to stay till the end. Such a shame as he has an incredible voice.  "
"What a mess!

If you have a lease that has not yet expired, you don't just move it without a written document signed by the landlord which terminates your tenancy and obligations.  

Anyone can threaten anyone for anything.  A threat simply to call lawyers is really meaningless.  When you write,

&gt;Do we have any basis for threatening to call our lawyers as well,

you come off as both ignorant and immature.  In the next sentence you say you ""bought a house.""  Please tell me that you used a lawyer for this transaction.  If so, call him now.

You and your landlord both have the right to call your attorneys.  It's quite clear you have no idea what you are doing.  As for the landlord, no one knows.  Again, get an attorney. "
Skews heavily asian. Really also thought it was one of the best. Haven't been on it in like 2 years though. 
"Awesome thank you!!! Def to put juku on the shortlist then. Just curious, what did you find disappointing about Yasuda? "
The climate and the animals needs 
"I'll second [Campmor](https://www.campmor.com/CustomerServiceContent_____aboutus). But, getting to it is a pain unless OP has use of a car. 

OP, if you make that trek, be aware that everything along 17 in Paramus is closed on Sundays.

Out of curiosity, have you noticed Campmor starting to have less of a selection than they used to have? They're starting to seem like they may be going out of business. They're not crowded and have very few registers open. Last time I was there, they were doing all checkouts at the customer service desk. They had quite a bit of open floor space too and not great selections on several items my wife and I were there to check out.

I hope they're not going out of business. I agree that they've been a great place for a good selection of gear generally at lower prices than most. Perhaps they're doing mostly online business now?"

"&gt;Asians

Read the first word of your previous comment, dude. You were clearly trying to speak for all Asians."
"Good to know. Yeah, the Palm House seems way out of our budget. The weddings there are so gorgeous though; I know because I used to cater for them. I'm sure a ceremony in the garden was lovely as well."
"Not sure if you are aware, but 'skincare products for men' is just a marketing scheme; you can use any product (for men or for women) that fits your skin type condition. 

I would also check out r/skincareaddition and r/AsianBeauty to do research before you purchase any products.

"Cafe China and Casa Enrique (not sure whether both still hold stars, but both are great &amp; great value)."
My sister got roofied there. Fun times. /s
