"Yes, they live about 460 miles away but we made it up to see them last summer. He has a large extended family and they treat us like blood now.

His dad breaks down and cries and thanks us every time we see them. We were literally the only voice of reason as the rest of my family tried to stay away and hope they didn't pull them in like we were."
"Basically, I have a small hole in one of my teeth. So one day during our teip my mother saw my face and it was really swollen. So we go down to the receptionist and ask to see a dentist. (We did this because before our trip we went to go see the dentist about my lose adult tooth and he said it was probably nothing but just incase take these antibiotics. We forgot them)

So anyways, we got to the dentist and my mother was taken out of the room and told I was diagnosed with the triangle of death and I had 48 hours to live. Basically the triangle of death is (at least for me) infection gets in your tooth and infects your nerves (first corner) then it gets to your nose making you feel congested (2nd corner) then it goes to your brain causing permanent brain damage, comas and death. But since I was so young I would've just died (3rd corner)

He gave me antibiotics to slow down the infection and since I live in Canada, Disney paid all ths expenses (god bless).

About 7 years later it happened again, found out I hot only had a cyst there but also a cyst on my two front teeth, thats very rare too. I got surgery and I should be fine now but my tooth is dead, its loose and im waiting on a replacement. Overall what makes this really rare is what happened but mostly the age and how it happened."
I also want to mention that I am no longer married to him and got out of it the ‚Äòmarriage‚Äô
"This should be in the main post.  It seems misleading to not mention your spouse is Australian, which one would assume is a major reason for moving there."
Thanks for the tip friend! Gonna have to call the gang and update the plan.

Give me a break my moms a retard did you expect me to know how to spell? üôÇ
"A car parked in buttfuck nowhere with the trunk left open, like 4 am, near a trail which leads down to a lake. 
I made my way down to the lake and on the end of the dock there was a motionless body. I almost shat myself and did a sweep of the beach and area around the dock before stepping onto it because I figured whoever left the body on the dock was still around and I didn‚Äôt wanna get trapped on the dock. I made my way over presenting myself and when I got close I realized it was a woman with a bloody face, really shifting my pants now. She woke up when I was about ten feet away and I am ashamed of this but just wanted to run away. Glad I didn‚Äôt as I soon found out her boyfriend got drunk and kicked the shit out of her at their campsite so she took his car and ran away. I brought her to the station and let her sleep in the infirmary, in the morning she didn‚Äôt want to press charges and went back. Which was unfortunate because all the neighbours had complained about noise so we had to throw them out. That car ride must have been hell.."
"yep, nope.  I'm out,"
"Actually, we're supposed to say ""come back and see us soon"" but I would get great joy from saying ""come again soon!"""
The Womanizer Premium. It's a clitoral toy that uses air pulses kind of like a bass beat but surrounding your clit. It's unlike any other clit toy I've ever used and basically sucks the orgasm out of you like a dementor.
Oh you sweet summer child. Yes. It's called the Dick Rambone. Naming 10/10.
"I would absolutely love to say something to the effect of ""hi there, welcome to the store. Don't fucking open any boxes, yes people buy the 17 inch dildo, and we only sell TOBACCO products"""
Sounds like you traded up.
Okay Canada then maybe
"the huge spiders. I spent the first 6 months screaming like a little kid chasing 125mm huntsman around the house at night ... but after awhile I gave up killing them. Plus there were splotches all over the walls and ceiling. I then started actually taking care of them. Moving the Orb weavers when they are in danger, feeding them when they look weak. Catching and releasing the Huntsman...I have grown to love the spiders and other insects but this and the snakes was the greatest challenge to adapting. The browns and Pythons show up everywhere."
"My wife and I don't live our lives like they used to. I work and she is a stay at home mom, but we consider that her job as well. So when I come home, Ill help around the house. It works for us, but my family always hated that she wouldnt cook for me and how it was lazy of her that I change a diaper or two. 

We moved closer to them because I got a better job. Anytime we were going to go out, they would volunteer to watch the baby. They got it in their heads that my wife was a horrible mother and started sending me messages telling me her behavior was unacceptable, and I needed to kick her out. One thing led to another, there was shouting, my mother threatened to have the baby taken away, so we packed up in one day and left to be closer to her family out west."
"Nice, France, July 14, 2016. A man drove a 19-ton Renault cargo truck through a crowd of thousands, killing 86 (84 instantly, 2 later succumbed to their wounds) and injuring around 430 (only counting admissions to hospitals)."
I used to be an adventurer like you but then I took a 17 inch dildo to the ass
And how are you today? Do you need help?
"Thanks. The first few years were extremely difficult as my daughter had to get used to we don't see grandpa any more. She would basically lose her cousins also.

Now we realize how toxic they were and our lives are much better without them in it.

Its tough around the holidays I won't lie but it was just a high price to pay"
"It‚Äôs really hard to get inside the trucks, they‚Äôre heavily armored and it‚Äôs not like we would just open the doors for them because they had a firearm. We have gun ports to stick the barrels of our firearms outside the trucks and have the ability to fire our weapons while still being inside the truck. The only instances where it would be ‚Äúeasy‚Äù would be when we‚Äôre outside at an ATM with our backs turned to the crowd and if the driver wasn‚Äôt paying attention to his/her surroundings."
I like to think so yes
The ‚Äúdanger triangle‚Äù is a region where the blood supply can make infections spread to the brain more easily. You don‚Äôt have to fulfill three corners as you put it.
Do you still keep in contact with your BIL and his kids?
There is not a day that goes by when my mother doesnt call me crying. She's in mental anguish and she doesnt understan stand why. She live in a home right now because she became abusive. She asks me everyday if she was a good mom. With tears in my eyes I respond yes. She wasn't. Dating never really changed for me I still did that.   Confidence level has always been low but I dont know if I could blame that on my mother.
When I was a kid I was taught the I had a dad and that was it. Of course I wanted to meet my dad. Now as an adult I'd want to meet him to only know what he was thinking. I want to know if he had a flaw in his thinking that he could have sex with my mom and it would be ok or if he was an actual predator. If that makes sense.
"I always go watch the sunrise on a beach, the other day I heard a noise in the woods so I went to check it out. There was a college aged couple fucking in the woods, they both just looked at me and just kept going. I turned my back to them and presented myself verbally, they said hi and shot going. I had to say the phrase ‚Äòplease stop fucking while we‚Äôre talking‚Äô."
"I‚Äôm not the best, nor am I where I should be. It took a while for me to get through it and I‚Äôm still dealing with the repercussions of being in that horrible situation to this day, I‚Äôm surprised I made it out.

Life‚Äôs not been good to me, but situationally I‚Äôm much better then I was and obviously from 17 to almost 20 I‚Äôve made a lot of self development progress. I‚Äôm still finding my footing in this world as a young adult I‚Äôm studying and pursuing higher education and have a super small yet reliable support system.

If anything I do acknowledge I need psychological help because I struggle with mental health, yet to my detriment it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôve sought out at this time."
"Yes, I absolutely feel objectified by customers from time to time. I've developed a pretty good creep radar and can usually tell right away if a guy is going to be creepy when he walks into the store. I've definitely had to become more assertive and thankfully I work for a company that backs me up when I have to kick people out for being a creep. 

I think one of the weirdest was early on in my sex store career, a guy came in to look at DVDs and I was the only person working. He seemed very normal so I didn't have my guard up. As I walked by the DVD aisle he was in, I happened to glance over and he had his dick pulled out of his basketball shorts. Casual as fuck, staring straight ahead. I was kind of in shock and on my round trip back to the counter, he had put himself away. I was too nervous to confront him."
"Make a fire, stay warm, stay safe and **stay put**. Then in the morning try and make a signal fire or something to be noticed, don‚Äôt go get more lost though.

"As you know from experience, blood family isn't always loving and reliable. 

Though your choice has been painful, you gave a beautiful and priceless gift to your daughter. You taught her about the true meaning of love - to protect the vulnerable even at great cost. 

You also taught her the meaning of chosen family - those people (whether blood related or not) who support, honor and respect you."
My mother acts like a child and is dangerous. She cant stop crying. I personally dont know why. She's doesnt understand social cues. No one can understand her half of the time.
Clenched or relaxed bum cheeks and why
I‚Äôm so sorry you went through all this... How are you doing now?
Do people try to hit on you after?
"Do you get to see the art that comes from this, and if so is that usually a happy thing or a cringy thing?"
"haha... I don't blame you. Snakes, spiders and bugs everywhere... I have been bitten by snakes, stung by everything on the land and in the ocean and the snakes are everywhere. We got up one morning and there was a brown snake skin in my daughters room....Browns are very, very dangerous. We had a 12 foot python laying on our front porch. When the wind blows, the spiders swing out of their webs like kites..you are walking down the sidewalk and here are all these 3 inch spiders that look like multicolored black widows floating in the air in front of your face LOL......"
What do you wish you could tell customers when they first walk in?
My wife is Australian but had was living in the USA when I met her.

"Lol, good luck."
"He's from Minnesota and I'm from New York. Not terribly far, but he served in the military for four years and jumped around the country. The time never worked out to visit each other until now. I plan to go back to Minnesota next month."

"I was servicing a major car event, it‚Äôs HUGE. If I said what event it was that would pinpoint my location but the most I ever had in the truck at one time was 40 million usd."
"Before we ever knew it was even going to court he dropped off this kerosene heater out of the blue.
Then the next week he gives me some very expensive tickets to a game so my wife and I could go. This was all very uncharacteristic of him.

The worst thing that happened was he had a retirement Alaska cruise planned for a year before this happened.
This all started heating up 2 months before the trip. It was supposed to be my sister her kids and my family. My daughter was so excited so excited..
They pushed the court date up before the trip.

After we testified he called the travel agent and canceled our 3 non refundable spots. My daughter cried for days as he and my sister and her kids went without us then posted pictures all over Facebook.

The fact he did that to my young daughter was when I realized how evil he was.

So he was holding that Alaska trip over our heads also."
Why did you choose Australia and not Europe?
Not physically. I went to go on to get an associates degree. Mentally I've been diagnosed with schizophrenia. I'm not schizophrenic. Was severely depressed. Not from My mom
"Ah, thanks for that clarification. Thats how I interpreted it with the corners. Ill explain it like that next time I tell the story."
Theres a time and place for everything. Here and now was not.
"Did they put their clothes back on first or walk around nude? 

Serious question"
"Glad you were safe 
Which one ?"
"Oh okay! There are creams that naturally enhance female hormones associated with libido. The one I know of is called ON Libido for her and it's made by the company Sensuva. It's put on the chest or inner arms every day. 

Clit cream is applied directly and adds more sensation. Sensuva makes one called ON also. It tingles and heats. Another clit cream called Awaken by Wicked is actually supposed to increase libido over time, the more you use it, the more you desire sex. 


There are female enhancement pills too, which are actually the same as male enhancement pills. They're vitamins that help increase blood flow, so it makes everything more sensitive. Pink pussycat is the most popular female pill. 

I would also suggest a pussy or clit pump to pull blood into the area and make it more sensitive."
Ok well I think this might be the problem here
My grandma helped us. Through my whole adolescents.
I hope to do the same. Glad you got out and are happy!
Assuming the reason you didn't meet for 12 years had something to do with distance; how far apart did you live from each other?
"If you are a guy, I would have your testosterone levels looked at by a doctor. We do have some products that help enhance your natural testosterone like creams and male enhancement pills, but my educated guess is that testosterone treatment from a doctor would be the most helpful."
"At my current store, we'll replace it if it's defective and in a certain amount of time but we definitely break policy sometimes to appease people. We're pretty firm on most things because most of the time they're bullshitting us. Most of the time we'll offer to give them a discount on a similar item that works better for them."
Whats the scariest thing you've seen?
What was the biggest struggle you faced moving to Australia? Glad you love it mate!
Why is it inaccurate?  What standards do armored truck drivers hold to vs say bank tellers or cashiers when it comes to a robbery?
What happened?
"It was an almost indescribable feeling. Seeing him and his wife at the airport for the first time. I've known both of them for the same amount of time, since all three of us met online on the same game. So to finally meet them after hearing their voices / seeing their faces on cam for a literal decade... It was pretty wild."
Not OP obviously but I took a life drawing class in college with nude models. Both of the models were accomplished artists themselves and it was like having 3 teachers. They would walk around the room once the assignment was complete and talk to each one of the students. It was really great to have so much constructive criticism!
Can you please explain the events that started this behaviour from your family towards your wife?
"This guy named scarface (that's our nickname for him because, well, he has a scar on his face). He's a big, miserable brute that finds no joy in anything. He comes in once a week or so to buy a male enhancement pill and complain about our rewards program."
"My cousin died in 2016 from heroin. You know how this goes. You either die or you get sober and stay sober. There‚Äôs no in between. 

As for my question...

I love America but I could never go back. It was hard to get here and live in OZ legally but worth the effort. I think that the USA will figure it out (if that is where you live) .. but after our school shooting in Las Vegas where 3 people died ... we had to get our kids out.
"When I have taken painting classes that had nude models, they usually put on a bathrobe or something when they walked around to look at the paintings.  I was weirded out drawing random naked people at first but you just start to look at them as a collection of lines and colors."

"so how is your mother exactly ""mentally retarded""? does she look different, talk different, act different? does she act like a child? is she dangerous?"
"When I was on a delivery in a somewhat sketchy area towards the evening, the guy I was delivering to was a 6‚Äô3, 250+ dude. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4 and about 125 pounds. The guy goes, ‚ÄúYou got a boyfriend?‚Äù I had one at the time and replied ‚ÄúUh yeah,‚Äù and instead of backing off he went, ‚ÄúHe black?‚Äù ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs white.‚Äù I‚Äôm already almost to my car at this point and he yells, ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt count! I‚Äôll give you the fattest dick you‚Äôll ever have in your life!‚Äù 

When I was selling phones, I had a cracked out woman come in and go into explicit detail about how her phone is possessed by Satan and comes alive at night to choke the shit out of her, for like an hour. I have the tail-end of that conversation on video somewhere. I got her a new phone and then she went to her car that was parked right in front of the store and stayed in there with the engine on, dancing in her seat with the brights blaring for more than three hours and was still there when I left the store. 

At the same phone store, I almost got robbed by four dudes who didn‚Äôt know my male coworker was right outside through the side door. He came in to see what was up and they left. About 30 minutes later our massive group chat was going off about how four guys robbed the store 10 minutes away. 

Same store again, my new manager was nauseatingly nice. So sweet, somewhat attractive guy. Tells me in advance he has some pretty severe medical issues, one being cancer in his colon. He‚Äôd leave me at the store for sometimes 12 hours and say he was going to doctor‚Äôs appointments in Chicago. He opened up and said one night he has been trying to turn his life around because he used to sell drugs when he got diagnosed and because someone hijacked his supposed $50k car, committed a bunch of crimes in it, then crashed it, killing the people inside. We were kinda close for a few months and he was so nice to the point where he would make me feel so bad for being irate that I‚Äôd be working these ridiculous hours, especially during school. He also had a 90-pound girlfriend who he‚Äôd been dating for about a month or two when I was close to quitting and she was pretty nice as well, admitted to me that she has been off-and-on addicted to Xanax and has four kids that she doesn‚Äôt have custody of. Another month later, manager knocked her up. Right after this, he messages me early in the morning saying his house got burglarized and that he got stabbed and had a gun shoved in his face and they took everything in his house and all of his meds/medical weed so I spent the entire day trying to get someone to help me run the store while I drove around doing his dirty manager work and transferring devices to other locations in the area. Not long after, I quit the company and found out almost right away that he got fired for doing cocaine in the back office and a customer saw him do it when a coworker opened the door, and him and his pregnant girlfriend got pulled over and arrested for possession and distribution of over 10 grams of meth. I still have their mugshots lol. He had lied to me about having cancer and left me at the store so he could go sell meth with his girlfriend and he ended up also stealing my very expensive phone that I was trading in right before I quit. I was delivering for my new job one day like two months later and apparently ended up delivering to him and his girlfriend‚Äôs house and they had the order under a fake name. The glass window on the door is shattered and duct taped shut. His gf answers the door, all cut and bruised up, and pulls me inside and ducks down and tells me that manager guy got super meth‚Äôd out and shoved his arm through the glass to unlock the door and beat her up really badly. She gave me her number and said to hang out with her since she has no friends (I never texted her) and not to tell anyone, and then I left. Weeks go by and I hear she‚Äôs back with dude and is still pregnant and doing drugs. I never saw either of them again after that. 

I got a lot of shit at the restaurant but these take the cake to me. But I‚Äôm also very exhausted and these are what come to mind right now."
Nah. It's pretty professional.
"It‚Äôs good you were there. Fun (depressing fact): a person (typically a women) has to try to leave their abuser an average of 7 times before it is permanent. Maybe you helped with I e of those 7 times- and that is certainly something. 

Those in abusive situations are at their most vulnerable when they are first running away/ leaving. It‚Äôs good you found her not her abuser. 

Thank you for sharing this story."
"I started thinking my apartment was bugged with hidden cameras and speakers. Tore apart my whole apartment before a family member caught me in the act. They asked why and I replied with ""you cant hear them!?"" Off to the hospital I went."
"I‚Äôm no longer married to him, the marriage fell apart very quickly because I was forced into it and he was essentially a stranger. There were a lot of cultural differences between me and him as he was born and bred in a Muslim country for most of his life and I was not. He exhibited controlling and emotionally abusive behaviour, for instance he would try and bully me into consummating the marriage, he wanted kids ASAP and would control my interactions to the outside world. This was all very early on in the marriage, I‚Äôm talking a few days.

For the short period I was married to him I felt like a prisoner devoid of any free will. For the months prior to turning 18 I knew my fate was sealed. Most teens are excited about turning 18 yet I was petrified of it. 

There was no understanding or equal power dynamic within the relationship as he was financially more secure and I lacked independence, he had a massive upper hand by default. I had to move across the country to live with him in a different state, I knew no one and was essentially alone."
"At first I was mad a lot. I was really angry at my diagnosis, and had wished I had cancer because at least then I would be taken seriously and been treated. My prognosis was 99% with that diagnosis. My diagnosis now (Gaucher Disease) will not kill me assuming I don't go into organ failure. 

The issue is that because the treatment is expensive ($50,000/month), they (government) don't want to pay for it unless you're in a bad place. My issue with this is that it is proven to prevent disease progression. So instead of treating me so I don't get worse, they want to wait until I get worse (so until my liver and/or spleen and/or bone marrow stop working) before they will treat it. These protocols are almost 30 years old and have not been updated even with changes to treatments.

I currently have tumors on my spleen (which it turns out are rare even for my disease) but it's not enough.

The hardest pill for me to swallow was having to stop working. I don't qualify for disability based on hours worked, so I no longer really contribute much to the family (I do a bit of closed captioning freelancing when I can) and that's been a huge hit to my mental well being. Makes me feel like a liability to my husband. 

Now I realize being mad won't get me anywhere, and I am trying to live my life from the point of being as happy as I can and enjoying what I can. I don't have time to be angry all the time. I don't know whether I will have early onset Parkinsons (something that can happen with the disease) and I want to enjoy as much time with my kids as possible."
"Haha, all the time. But, every single time someone got that idea and tried to steal some money, they‚Äôd get caught. There are cameras inside the truck and we can‚Äôt disable them (guys have tried to), and everything we do gets documented and accounted for so it would be really difficult to make that happen."
"&gt;There is not a day that goes by when my mother doesnt call me crying. She's in mental anguish and she doesnt understan stand why. She live in a home right now because she became abusive. She asks me everyday if she was a good mom. With tears in my eyes I respond yes. She wasn't.

This is heartbreaking. I'm sorry. You are a good, kind person for understanding the importance of that lie and easing her pain even though it hurts you... But I am nonetheless sorry that you, her child, have to be the one to do it.

I'm sorry that you have to bear all these burdens for yourself *and* for your mom, and I'm sorry that she can't the the mom you need and deserve.

I hope things work out for you, friend."
I've been doing it for about a year. Today wasent the same pose for 3 hours. But I've done those before. I get breaks like every 20 or 30 mins. I've got hard just a few times. Normally it'll kinda go from soft to cub then soft again. Or might not do anything. 20 an hour.
"We both cook dinner. Or if I had a rough day then she will cook for me. It all depends. Like I said, its a system that works for us, but not for everyone I guess."
"No, I do not believe in Islam. I haven‚Äôt since I was 15."
I'm from a third world country and Australia has changed my life forever. Such a beautiful country with amazing people. When all the world rejected me it's the Australia which exalted me. I love you Australia seriously.
Do u swing with each other?just for old times shake.
Depends on the pose and what they want to see lol.
"No, I‚Äôm currently single! One of the benefits of living in a western country is that I do have rights, one of many is that since we hadn‚Äôt been legally married on paper yet, it was an Islamic Sharia marriage which made it much easier to walk away from. I wasn‚Äôt the wife he expected either (at 17 how could he expect me to be) so he let me walk away.

I think that any man in his late thirties who is fine with marrying a teenager isn‚Äôt okay, in all honesty I think he was just as culpable for facilitating it, as an adult the onus is also on him. In the short while we were married he was exhibiting controlling and emotionally abusive behaviours (eg. bullying me and complaining to my parents that I hadn‚Äôt consummated the marriage) so safe to say I hold a massive grudge.

I still live with my parents and do hold resentment, more so to my mum since she was the main instigator and my dad was more of a yes man. Although much to my surprise at the time my mum didn‚Äôt end up outing my assault (she told my dad tho after the failed marriage) they blamed me for the failure of the marriage and it took a while for everything to go back to ‚Äònormal‚Äô I know my mum feels remorseful for what she has done although she has never apologised. She receives money that comes from an investment property and I now pocket that and have used it towards my education and lifestyle so in a way I look at it as ‚Äòreparations‚Äô...
It‚Äôs never brought up and we pretty much act like it didn‚Äôt happen. 
Although I don‚Äôt let my parents or my mum push me around any more and if she tried anything like this again on me then I wouldn‚Äôt have a bar of it."
"I know that with sex toys, you usually can't return them (even with a receipt). Have you ever had a customer so irate that you accepted a return or in-store credit for a sex toy?"
"It's $200 for the premium, but there's a mini version for $100 that works the same. It's definitely worth it and they offer a money back guarantee if you can't come in under 90 seconds after using it for a month.

Can confirm this is possible."
Ignore the assclown dude. His post history is all trolling.
"Thank you so much.

Your comment means a lot.

The relationship I now have with my wife's family is truly incredible.

Her other grandpa loves her more than anything.

She fully understands what happened and why things are the way they are."
Lol. That's a fucking fantastic analogy. 10/10.
No question. Just here to say that I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre living a better life and you‚Äôre very strong
NO THANK YOU I WILL NOT BE JOINING YOU THERE
Is this your first gig? Does it suck holding the same pose for 3 hours? What's the weirdest pose you've had to do? Do you get to take breaks? Have you ever popped a boner/lady boner while posing? How much does it usually pay per session?
"So, you deny having schizophrenia, yet you've been diagnosed with it, and admit that the symptoms persist?

Also, your situation sucks, and I'm sorry... but the way you talk about your Mother, a mentally challenged rape victim, makes you sound like a cunt."
Do you know of anything that genuinely helps build up a sex drive?
"To be honest, it sounds like a valid question given the extraordinary circumstances."
"Do you ever feel objectified as a female in the workplace?

What‚Äôs the weirdest story from your time there?"
As a practicing Muslim man about to get married I can tell you that you that you did the best thing by leaving him. He probably knew you were being forced because any man with an iota of decency would have asked you multiple times before marrying you if you were okay with the marriage let alone marry someone with such a big age gap. Even though I live in a backward country like KSA I have already told my fiance she can work freely after marriage and she can even choose where we can honeymoon since she loves traveling. Most Muslim men are like me these days as we grew up with moderate beliefs and understand that in Islam a woman's position is higher than men. I really do hope you find your soul mate who will treat you with the kindness and love you deserve.
Did your mom raise you alone? Were your grandparents around to help?
Thank you :) I am! Actually on vacation in the same city right now.
how does knowing this affect your daily life? Like does it interfere with dating or confidence?
Extremely bitter. I sometimes want to live my own life without this burden of having a retarded mother. Somedays I feel like it would be better if she was dead. In all honesty I doe play the woe is me card. I have no advice because idk. Haven't figured it out myself.
Attending a BDSM party and being a degenerate.
"God no. They're either hard as a rock gummy panties with loose sugar on it (aka, yeast infection), or like those hard candy necklaces. Either way, not fun. I would suggest a tasty water based flavored lube. It can go anywhere and on any kind of toy."

What was the most valueable one thing you picked-up or delivered? Or how much was the biggest load worth?
"No. I used to work at a store that had video preview booths and an arcade and there weren't glory holes there either, but guys absolutely hooked up back there. As far as I know, my area has closed all the arcades within the last year or so."
"The most intense situation I was in didn‚Äôt involve any robbers, but the police thought I wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúreal‚Äù armored courier and drew their weapons at me. I was servicing a bank, at the drive-thru ATM‚Äôs and was pulling money out, one of them was in the parking lot across from me pointing and saying stuff, so I looked around and didn‚Äôt know what the deal was so I kept working as I couldn‚Äôt just leave the cash exposed and out. When I was nearly done, 4 police officers came around the side of the bank and told me to stop what I was doing. I explained to them I couldn‚Äôt, and I was just doing my job but they didn‚Äôt like that. They said an alarm was set off and that it was me, and how can I prove I was a ‚Äúreal‚Äù armored courier. I asked the one that was demanding the orders, ‚ÄúHow do I know you‚Äôre real police officers, it‚Äôs easy to get a badge and uniforms and he said, ‚ÄúLook, our cars are right over there‚Äù, so me being how I am, I said, ‚ÄúOk, well here‚Äôs my armored truck, so by your logic I‚Äôm legit, right?‚Äù. Well. Obviously they didn‚Äôt like that and I told them, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt set off any alarms, I‚Äôve been doing this for a while now. I  told them, ‚ÄúGo inside the bank and see if anyone is in there because whatever alarm went off wasn‚Äôt outside.‚Äù So, 2 left to go inside and see what was going on while I‚Äôm still outside, holding about 200k in my damn bag and they wouldn‚Äôt let me move at this point so that alone was already a major issue. A few minutes pass by and the 2 come back, firearms holstered and all of the sudden guess what, they‚Äôre really, really nice and started apologizing. I guess the bank manager set off an alarm inside and it wasn‚Äôt me, obviously. They wanted to chat and try to make things ‚Äúbetter‚Äù but by this point I was pretty upset and told them to just leave and let me do my job. Fun times."
"lol, sharing is caring."
I remember.  That is wild.  Crazy times.  Hope you are doing well man.
"I think you are correct.

The bottom line is he was willing to throw us away and another grandchild to try and continue to lie for her.

The crazy thing to us was in the beginning he would tell us look if you guys are telling the truth and it comes out shes on drugs and seeing that convict then I'll stop the entire thing (the case he was paying for her lawyers).

Well the PI nailed my sister buying crack drug tests came back positive etc..Her boyfriend was calling threatening us etc..

So then I go DAD SERIOUSLY NOW YOU KNOW. He literally says ""She said she didn't fail the drug test son""
Here is the document dad. Here are the voicemails of her boyfriend threatening me. He shut down and started attacking me.

This is when I got freaked out because I had never encountered a seemingly normal person basically turn mentally ill before my eyes like that.

Many people Including us could only describe it as he was in a trance like state."
"This is so wholesome!

Did you made more friends through Habbo Hotel?"
"No questions, just wishing you the best!"
"I'm not sure if it's weird because of the context, but there is a regular that buys all of our huge dildos. Old guy with hair like a wet mop and he loves the Bonnie Rotten big black cock the most. I don't know why he needs more than one."
"Not at work... I fired a bear banger above the heads of some people who were fighting one time, got everyone attention real good."
#BURN IT TO THE GROUND
"It‚Äôs the greatest job on the planet. 

It is called a national park but it is run by the province. No comment on the nationhood status but that‚Äôs Quebec for ya. 

It can take a while to move up but just like with any job if you scratch the boss‚Äô back they‚Äôll scratch yours. I was asked to work nights as a favour with the deal being that I get to skip a step and am next in line to become a game warden ranger when one of the old guys retire (next year or the year after), that comes with a decent raise and a piece of the park all to myself. 

I have had to travel like a fool, when I first started I was commuting like 300km one day and 50km the next as they bounced me all around. That‚Äôs another perk of night shift, at least I‚Äôm always at the same station. 

I like stars, and the other reasons given. 

My favourite thing about the job is I get to feel like I‚Äôm actually helping the world. From explaining to people why it‚Äôs not ideal to burn dead wood to explaining that soaps with perfume will cause you to be eaten alive by bugs, I get to help people enjoy nature and (hopefully) help protect the planet."
"Cutting family out is never an easy choice, no matter how bad the situation is, but you did the best thing for yourself and your child :) 

Your daughter will grow up knowing her Dad will do everything he can to protect her and that‚Äôll stay with her :)"
Thats against my morels though.
"Two questions:

1) What should someone do when they're lost in the woods at night?

2) Have you ever met a ranger with the name Park?"
you gonna trim first?
I know where all the berries are:)
"We have tester products (vibrators and lubes) that people can feel and test the functions. You can taste or feel the lubes also. 

As employees we can extensive training on all the products and that includes some free products and a generous discount. 

It's definitely easier for me to sell things I've used and the company knows this and so do vendors so I have a lot of products from working here."
Nice
"I have, I made this account when I started working nights;) there‚Äôs a fair amount of free time."
"Not trying to be a dick, but just judging by your responses here I think your problem is more attitude than anything else.  Unattractive and awkward people find love all the time, but when you throw in a terrible attitude your odds plunge dramatically."
"Long time concessionaire employee here.

&amp;#x200B;

Leave us alone when we are smoking weed in the woods please, thanks."
"No, probably not. Every employee gets trained how to deal with being held at gunpoint, and every driver gets trained how to use the truck as a weapon. We had hand signals and gestures only we would understand. The clearance beneath the truck is enough that if you laid down, you wouldn‚Äôt get ran over. So, in that scenario the driver would drive towards them and let his partner know (either via intercom or hand signals if there is eye contact) that he‚Äôs gonna run them over so you‚Äôd better drop and hold the other guy on top of you so they get hit rather than the partner in question. There are also gun ports so if that wasn‚Äôt an option, you can stick your firearms outside of the truck while still being inside, and just hope the robber gets scared and lets him/her go."
"""could you not fuck while i am talking to you it triggers my feelings about my relationship with my absent borderline mother"""
Farting can be controlled. I eat light the night before hand. Ill eat burritos and taco bell after the class.
"Can I offer unsolicited advice? There's this quote I really enjoy by Viktor Frankl.

""So live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!""

His book, Man's Search for Meaning, is a staple in my life. I don't mean to imply you're acting wrongly. Far from it. But by taking that mindset, I've found myself doing things differently than what my original inclination or impulse steers me towards."
"Pepperjack, but I am starting to develope a taste for provolone."
I'm in the US. We are hoping to move to NZ. My husband has job contacts there. We're just trying to tie up lose ends here now.
As you may already know then...NZ is awesome. IF I did not live in Australia I would live in NZ. I spent a lot of time on the North Island. NZ is also a great gateway to Australia. Many of my friends here in Brisbane are Kiwis living here. My kids go on vacations to Queenstown and hike the south Island every year. Great country.
"&gt;Which one ?

It is sad we have to ask that"
Are there any glory holes located in the store?
"In unrelated news, Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and Twitter users are [reporting major problems](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-07-03/facebook-instagram-and-whatsapp-users-report-major-outages). Haven't fact-checked the story and don't know why it might be true if it's the case."
C'mon that was like the least important question there
"This mostly involved my stepfather; he and my mother had 11 children (a mixed family). He is no longer allowed to be around his children due to my ‚Äúrebellion.‚Äù Immediately after the police separated him from everyone my mother blamed me for ‚Äúsplitting our family apart.‚Äù I was locked in my room for days, I had any access to the outside world shut off from me for literal years. But after a year or so, when my mother moved her children away from the situation, it suddenly became her idea and she took all the credit. I was just a rebellious teenager, she was a brave single mom that took on the bad guys (even though before this she turned a blind eye to the abuse of her own children in her own house). Two weeks before I turned 18 she kicked me out with a text message. I haven‚Äôt spoken to her in 2 years, but fortunately I have kept in contact with my siblings."
"It's a bit of a mixed bag really. In that store there was a much larger male customer base because that store had video booths in the back. 

In my current store I see more women and couples unless they're a pill customer."
"Yes, people are just lines and colors... this is the first step......."
"Of course my mind wanders and worries about the future. But when I hold her and she looks me in the eyes, I can't help but smile and thank God this little girl is in our lives. We can't know the future which is scary, but she didn't make the decision to be born to those circumstances so we'll do the best we can to give her every chance to succeed. Her biological parents knew they couldn't give her the life we could and they've shared that with us multiple times, and we appreciate that they were brave enough to see that."
"I haven‚Äôt read them yet but just looked them up and I likely will read them soon. From the synopsis I read I would assume that they stop looking after a week because the odds of surviving a week in the woods are slim to none and you don‚Äôt want to be sending the SAR teams to constantly find dead bodies, that can seriously fuck up your team mentally if they‚Äôre always bringing in corpses. I know that with SAR dogs they will have people play injured to bring the dogs spirits up so they don‚Äôt get too depressed to work. 

It could be a money thing but there is a lot of time to think about your own mortality when you‚Äôre walking through the woods looking for a body."

"&gt;If you will open your eyes and look properly, Saudi women are the most respected and valued all over the world. 

Get the fuck out of here."
damn man thats wild do you have abnormalities too?
What‚Äôs your favorite product from the store?
I'm going to Hell for laughing at that.
Nah no ones ever said they wanted me to have one.
A tough choice; family or reason/justice. How did your father try to bribe you?
"Sidenote: I was on vacation when this happened, however, we continue to go here every year (as we have for 7 years before the attack) and we're not afraid to go out on Bastille Day anymore. I'm actually in Nice right now :)"
"I was 13, so I didn't really get the whole picture; also adrenaline kicked in - I wouldn't say it's not as bad as you think, but it's different than you'd think."
"She‚Äôs a stay at home MOM not a stay at home chef or a full time housekeeper. Her main duty is to take care of the kids. She works the same exact hours as her husband so why would the house duties fall on her solely? He lives there too, he eats there too. It sounds like the husband make the right decision and is an actual partner in their relationship/parenting and it sounds like you don‚Äôt have kids or are just very misogynistic"
"Holy shit you‚Äôre delusional. Once a gun is pointed at you, you aren‚Äôt drawing and firing fast enough to shoot the attacker first. I‚Äôm a police firearms instructor, I do a LOT of training (both as teacher and student), I promise you that you aren‚Äôt faster than a drawn gun. If your plan is to just risk your life for the money and absolute noncompliance, your best bet might be to just run away at an angle from your attacker. Maybe if he‚Äôs slow he won‚Äôt pop you before you start moving fast. But you‚Äôre *really* fucked if it‚Äôs two or three guys (and it usually is). I think you need to acknowledge reality, you are a deterrent to crimes of opportunity, but are entirely incapable of fending off a real experienced stick up crew. Johnny crackhead with his .25 loaded up with backwards .22 rounds doesn‚Äôt stand a chance against you though."
I didn't notice until my preteen years. My mom was very normal to me til that point. After when I started making social connections I realized my mom was different from other moms. I learned about the rape part in my early 20s. I was indifferent about it.
"Sheesh. Do people in the business ever ""joke"" about faking a robbery and taking it themselves. Like u said it wouldnt be ""your (or your companys) loss""."
This seems very fake and op is putting no effort into their responses...
"We met a lot of people on there. Even met a girl on there who lived close by and we ended up dating for three years. I still speak to some people I met on there, but definitely not as close friends as he and I are now."
"Harboring illegal weapons, planning attacks on government buildings. Nothing that came to fruition (thank goodness) but I was taught at a young age how to fire an AR-15 (illegal in my state) among other weapons."
"Glad that you have a supportive employer.

That‚Äôs weird as fuck though. Is there more of a male than a female customer base?"
"My family in the states swears that I sound Irish or even scottish at times and so I think the pronunciation of certain words has changed. But after 17 years,  people still immediately spot me here as American."
"When I first got off the plane in Brisbane Australia... first I was shocked....but second I got angry. I could not believe that a wonderful place like this existed and that I had not been told about it sooner LOL.. I was angry that as an American I had been told that America was the best...the best at everything and yet here I was seeing a better tax system, a better traffic system, a better medical system...a culture of cooperation in Australia....  yes, it did piss me off."
You‚Äôd be surprised. It‚Äôs normally people who are new and not used to handling a lot of money and start getting bad ideas. I was even with a guy that stole money and tried to pin it on me but it didn‚Äôt work. Roughly 3 days after he stole money they had the police waiting for him at the office.
Millions of Americans travel all over the world every year. What the heck are you talking about??
"Hahaha, not very many things would be. We're not supposed to ""casually"" swear though. I can only say ""cum swapping step sisters"" or ""fuck me silly bubble butt"" in it's official context!"
bro wtf is a lady boner what
"They have always been very kind. Her dad suffers from bipolar, but he is very good with taking his medication. They absolutly love our daughter, and were thrilled to hear we were moving closer to them."
"I've heard of a few people marrying someone from another country and finding out more and visiting their country and realizing they dont like America so much anymore.....its a weird thing to me that when most go on holiday they leave their countries to see other places but Americans rarely do. We are taught to believe we are free and in the best place in the world and made fear leaving, when the truth is were not North Korea but were not exactly free either, this isn't the best place in the world to live (maybe if you're wealthy) and most countries are just as safe if not safer."
"Are you bitter at all? My brother was conceived in the exact same situation, but adopted at age 3. And he holds so much bitterness and resentment about all of it.  I can‚Äôt even have a reasonable convo with him because he‚Äôs so aggressive and everything leads back to a ‚Äúwoe is me‚Äù story. I don‚Äôt know how to help him or connect with him. Any advice?"
"Well, if you‚Äôre going into the woods where getting lost is a possibility you should have a knife and fire of some sort (matches, lighter, ect) at the very least. 

If you have conifers you find the dried branches at the bottom of the tree and collect those, if you have deciduous trees you collect birchbark of some sort to get it going. 

Don‚Äôt try and light an emergency fire until you know you have more material for it than you will ever need to start a fire, you want it to work the first time so you don‚Äôt lose everything and have to start over. 

As far as burning down the entire forest, don‚Äôt light a fire on roots it can carry to the tree, be sure you have an open sky above you, make a nice wide berth for the fire if it‚Äôs dry and don‚Äôt let it get out of control."
"Should have clarified, was asking for female. She is having legitimate hormone issues but her sex drive is at 0 and she's looking for other options since we're in America and health insurance is shit and unable to meaningfully help."
"I've had some really stupid questions about what stuff is for/ how it works. Some of my favorites: 

-customer is holding a very small wireless bullet and asks if it's a butt plug 

-I'm explaining how a vibrator fits into the labia and a customer asks ""is that the vagina?"" 

-customer points to the big dildos and says ""oh, are those for big girls?"""
A cockmeat sandwich
I do if i want to. I never cringe lol. People are learning so i dont expect perfection.
Everyone likes a clean work space
I'm in! Maybe it could have been announced earlier? anyways. I'm in!
"Mostly, yes. Some implied that ISIL was responsible, but in my personal opinion, it was not, despite claiming responsibility; the attacker was not even a practicing muslim in that he ""violated several rules of the religion"" to put it this way."
"I want to start off by saying how very sorry I am that you were subjected to such a disgusting situation. I‚Äôm so glad you have escaped! 

I don‚Äôt want to sound insensitive and I‚Äôm really sorry if it is an insensitive question, but has this situation put you off marriage/falling in love?"
sooo.. you think maybe it was just a psychotic episode? and not full on schizophrenia?
"Less than half of Americans have a passport,  and a nice percentage of those are never even used.  Compared to most developed countries that is pretty low...I didn't say no Americans travel, just said most are less likely to do it outside of America.  Look into it, im not making it up. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
I mean when women are aroused their clits swell with blood so I think that would be a lady boner. Also getting wet?
Self sacrifice. Nice.
"Do you get nervous?

Is it a paid gig or do you do it just because?"
The BIL is now your family. He sounds like good people. Make his family yours and forget about your old family.
Ya. It's not bald but i trim it close to it.
I'm living in Nice at the moment. Do you refrain from doing anything on Bastille day out of fear?
Ehmmm... Yes it does sometimes? At least to me
Do they ever ask for a pose specifically with or without erection?
"Yeah, i mean trip was great though everyone treated me amazingly because they thought I was either a make a wish foundation kid of I had abusive parents (because I had a buzz cut). Overall tho ive gotten over it and now its a conversation starter"
That's amazing. There's also one called Cockzilla and the Great American Challenge
I know right?  One day I was sitting in my garage and here comes the most poisonous spider in the world...the funnel web ... just walking along. Sat down next to me to hang out for awhile. Now I would relocate it but at the time I tried to kill it. I hit it with a broom and broom just bounced off of it....these things are like crabs with a hard shell...It started rearing up and waving its 1 inch fangs at me.....they can wave the fangs in different directions. But anyway...... Australia as a continent is drying out and so all of the wildlife was forced onto the coasts and only the most deadly usually survived and so that is why everything is poisonous here LOL
"When I first started I had 2 interviews, a background check and had to take a polygraph test. So, yes they were heavy into checking your background and determining if you were suitable for the job. But the amount of detail they go into probably depends on the company, but I can tell you where I worked they took all of that very seriously."
We go here every summer - I did it to relive the events as they're not something I'd want to forget. It changed me in a major way.
"Quite a few, and I've never accepted a customer...but I have hooked up with a coworker."
"He probably donates them to the needy...
