"Lol. I had touched it, of course, if you know what I mean, but when I saw it, I thought it looked funny and I was laughing at it when I was alone. "
"Difficult to choose. Might be the sea. My friends took me to the seaside and told me to keep my eyes closed while they guided me down to the beach. It was so blue and huge and it was just so much water suddenly in front of me that I got really confused, lol. "
"Thanks! It was weird because people had described to me what I looked like and from feeling my body I thought I was a bit chubby and had large hands and feet and when I actually saw myself, I was like - wow, a nice guy, but that's not what I thought I look like at all. "
"Now I kind of wish I had seen the faces of my loved ones first, but they were standing aside from me to not bother the doctor. "
"Probably animals. I'm still exploring the animal kingdom, many of them seem so funny to me. "
"Any thoughts on your penis? I feel if i was blind and saw my own penis for the first time, i'd be pretty damn confused."
"1)I did dream before but my dreams were kind of dull. I was either talking to someone on the phone or live, reading my Braille books or hearing familiar songs. Now I dream differently, my first dream after regaining my vision was about the hospital where I got my surgery done.

2)It was very hard for me to understand what a color was. I think it's hard to explain a color to someone in a way they could picture it. You can describe objects but describing a color is very difficult and I mostly associated them with feelings and smells. Sunshine was yellow, the night air was blue, the Christmas tree was green, my guide dog was brown. That's how people tried to explain me that. I could picture these things in my head, but I couldn't imagine the actual color. Now I believe red is my favorite.

3) Yes, the world is much bigger than I had imagined it and there's so much to see. When I left the hospital, my head was going to all directions because so much was happening on the streets.

4) You can train it a little bit but it's mostly innate.

5) When I was blind, there was no such thing for me as ugly. There were textures that were unpleasant to touch but I didn't find them ugly. Now yes, there are some things I find unpleasing to the eye. "
Very emotional. I was crying for a good while. It was a laser surgery to remove the abnormal blood vessels in my retina.
What was the first thing you saw ? And now that you've seen so many things what was the first thing you wished you saw ? 
"&gt;laughing at it when I was alone

Some of us do that anyway."
"What kind of surgery was it and how did it work?

What were your first impressions when you were able to see?"
My parents have let me touch their faces so I had some thoughts about what they might look like but they turned out to be completely different just like everything else. They were smiling and I thought that they're all really nice. 
"No, it's nothing like closing your eyes. If you close your eyes, you can still see light behind your eyelids. It's very difficult to explain what's like to be blind. I can only describe it as nothingness. You just see nothing. No darkness, nothing. Maybe it's not a good explanation but I can't find other words. It's not black, it's not darkness, it's just nothing."
Don't bring him into this.
"Go out alone, without any guidance and be able to get somewhere on my own. That means so much to me. "
"I was laughing my head off when I saw a walrus. I know it probably wouldn't be funny to most people, but to me it was. "
How did it feel to see yourself in the mirror for the first time? Congratulations by the way :) I'm so happy for you. 
"Update: the shooter has been apprehended and the police are conducting an investigation of the school. Likely to find anyone who was hurt. We’re still in lockdown

Update 2: kids are being let out of the school now, I’m currently with my family getting some brunch. I’m probably gonna go home, take a nap, and play some Red Dead 2.

Update 3: Unfortunately, the guy who was shot has indeed passed away in the hospital. My best wishes go out to his family and friends

Update 4: According to my family and some others, the shooter was another student, and shot the guy in the back. After doing so he immediately went to a teacher and told them what he did. It’s pretty clear he didn’t come with the intent of killing one of his peers, just to show off that he had the balls to bring a gun to school."
"I had a trouble with associating things with their names. Because touching was mostly my way of seeing before, for a while I still had to close my eyes and touch something to know what it's called. Like, my mom brought flowers to my room, I saw them and at first, I didn't understand what it was because I had never seen what flowers look like, then I touched them and was like - oh, those are flowers! 

Now it's fine, I have understood what the world works like, but at the beginning, it was like being an adult baby basically. I had to learn everything like a small child would - what are things called, reading, writing, etc. "
"He's still with me, I don't think I would be able to give him away. I have come to love him so much and he has helped me for many years and even though it might be reasonable to give him to another blind person, I can't. "
"Woot, woot! I’m so happy for you! 

My questions are 1) when you were blind, how would you dream? Did you “see” things happening? Has that changed now that you can see?

2) How do you feel about colors? Could you even imagine them? Which one is your favorite?

3) Do you get overwhelmed by all there is to see?

4) Is depth perception learned or innate?

5) Did your idea of “ugly” change now that you can see?"
"Honestly, I have never dated in my life and I have never had a romantic relationship with anyone. Because of being blind I didn't go out a lot, didn't meet a lot of people. I was basically living in my small circle of family and friends. and I was homeschooled and probably no one would want a blind boyfriend anyway. But I'm straight, if you wanted to know that, and maybe one day I'll meet a female I'll feel that kind of attraction to. 

"
"Yes, that was one of the few things that were quite accurate. I had touched him enough to know what he's like. I don't know if he understands, I feel like he's still leading me when we go out for a walk. "
What are your plans now that your life has peaked? 
"Wow super ironic that the first thing you saw after being surgically healed from blindness was “blinds”. Bizarre. 

Congrats by the way, what true blessing!"
What’s your favourite thing to look at now that you can see?
"Lmaooo this is the best AMA I've ever read

Thank you so much "
It has messed my inner clock up a bit but that's probably my own fault because I tend to stay up late sometimes to explore the nighttime. 
"Probably sleep. Being blind, I went to bed early and I enjoyed sleeping because I was dreaming a lot and it allowed me to escape the reality of my life that I didn't want to accept. Now I don't want to sleep so much anymore because I feel like I might miss something by passing out for 8 hours, lol. "
"It's very hard to describe what it's like to be blind if you haven't experienced it. Maybe for people who go blind at some point in their lives, it seems like darkness but if you're blind from birth, it's more like nothingness. You just see nothing, not even darkness. I don't honestly know how to explain it."
"By the way, I'm sorry if I'm not answering some questions. When I see questions that are similar to those I have already answered many times, I skip them. Sorry! "
Thank you for your service. 
"Single mom here, thinking about trying to date again. Just want to say that you sound like fun and I bet those boys like having you around!

What’s your favorite part of dating a single mom? Least favorite part? How can single moms make dating easier on their new partners?"
What's ur favorite thing you've seen so far?
You're good at not being good at a single skill set. 
"Stay Fu**ed up for the next 8 hours and throw something together.

Edit: Fuck."
I wasn't hesitating at all. I never really accepted my blindness and always wanted to see and I was super excited to learn that it might be done.
"Anyone preparing food is always fully clothed, health department thing. "
What's it like to be swimming in money
"Yes, I would. Quite often to be honest, lol. Sometimes I remembered hearing a nice woman's voice on the streets and that did it for me. 

It took me a few months. "
"I don't wan to make you uncomfortable and don't want to guess at your sexuality, but I'm so curious as to how it felt to be see someone you were physically attracted to for the first time. Whether it was from a previous relationship or just someone at the grocery store, was it different having a visual element?

Thank you for sharing your experiences, I'm completely fascinated and will probably spend my evening researching this type of game-changing experience. My mother-in-law is deaf and has been contemplating getting a cochlear implant."
"Strangest request was to wear a pair of panties for two days, using my panties to wipe my ass after I shit each time."
"I had a private teacher who came and is still coming to my house to work with me and teach me English. It wasn't very difficult, I actually grasped it pretty quickly. Now I find it difficult to read Braille. 

I have seen pictures of them, yes. "
"Wasn't blind before, but I had laser eye surgery. Cried when I sat up and could read the time on the wall clock. Went from -10 vision to being able to see in *minutes*. It's such an emotional thing."
"It’s weird. I was scared as all hell less than half an hour ago, telling my family I love them, texting friends, the works. But now I just feel normal. I feel like my normal depressed self. You’re supposed to feel different after these things, like you have a new lease on life, but I just feel like everything is normal.

I almost don’t want to leave this room, it’s weirdly comforting now. A group of people who were loud and obnoxious are now calm and reasonable. If I go out I have to face the world and everything in it. Here I can just stay in my little bubble, with my friends on my phone, and not in this room. Leaving means talking to everyone I’ve texted in the last 45 minutes, having to deal with everything I’ve said to them. None of it bad, just things I wouldn’t say to them any other day.

Will things just go back to the way it was after this? How are we going to handle what the fuck just happened? People probably won’t come to school for a few days, and I don’t blame them. Some people might walk out of this with some serious PTSD. I was freaked out and I didn’t even hear any shots.

This is fucking insane. This shouldn’t happen, why did this happen? Things aren’t going to be the same after this, and I don’t know if the ever will. I can’t wait to talk to the police or news, and have to face the world as another teen in another “awful event.” Like they’re gonna do jack shit about it because they want to keep their precious toys that can also do shit like this.

My point is, this is insane, and I’m going to try my best to adjust. Do something about something. Whatever it is, take some action."
Was being blind the same as you closing your eyes now? What did being blind “look” like? 
I think this is called being human
Probably touring across the country going on talk shows and meeting celebrities and pro athletes. Mostly stuff like that after an event like this 
"Unfortunately, I don't have 20/20 vision. That wasn't possible. The cause of my blindness was complicated and I was only given about a 50% chance that the surgery will be successful at all. I have to wear glasses every day to sharpen my sight. 

I have honestly never dated before and I'm not very interested in doing it right now. This time has been very emotional to me and now I'm working on other things - I want to find a job, to become independent from my parents, find a living place of my own and travel. And then, maybe later I'll start to feel a need for another person. 

I was glad when I found out I wasn't chubby after all, lol. I exercised before and I exercise now. I enjoy running, swimming, weightlifting. My friend is a fitness trainer and he helps me with that. 

I didn't choose my clothes when I was blind. How could I, I didn't see them. My mother did it for me and I just trusted her taste because what else could I do. Now I choose clothes myself and when I look at my old pictures, that's not very different from what I used to wear before. I wouldn't say I'm very fashionable, I like to keep it plain and simple. 

"
Awwww that warms the fuck out of my heart. I’m tearing up. Give that dog some big hugs for me. He’s doing such a good job. 
"What did you think of your family when you first saw them ?

Did you picture how they would look like when you were blind ? If so, do they fit your mental picture?"
I have. They are magical! 
"Good questions, in my case it was probably helpful that she'd been a friend for some time first, and I've known her boys pretty much since birth. 

My favorite part is her, that sounds pretty simple but I think the most important thing is to be you first, avoid making everything about being a mom at least in the early stages of dating. Every single parent I know feels like they have to tell everyone over and over that ""my kid comes first and always will."" We know, if you're a half way decent parent and he's a half way decent guy he's never gonna question that. 

Remember everyone wants and needs to feel important and special in their relationship. When you're with him focus on him. get a sitter you can trust and go on a date. Later when and if things get serious then bring the kids into the mix. 

My least favorite part is definetly early mornings. I work late and like to come over in the evening and stay for coffee and breakfast but it's pretty rough when I get there at 9 or 10, we spend time together till midnight or so and the boys are wide awake and screaming at 6. Still it's worth it and when I'm exhausted I stay home and sleep in. "
The very first thing was the blinds of the window because that was right in front of me. 
"I like them, especially giraffes. "
It is. It turns your whole world upside down. 
"Oh Gosh, lol. Probably boobs though. "
Not a question but a kudos: one of the best AMAs ever around here.
"Attention all redditors, u/voiceoverpete is in great danger and he needs YOUR help!  
Help him understand AMA and how reddit works!  
Just send your credit card number, and the three numbers on the back and the expiration month and date for him to understand the AMA!  
But be quick before he breaks the rules or something worse!"
It was completely life-changing. I basically had to learn to live again.
"I have come across some disturbing pictures and videos of people abusing animals, also I wasn't delighted seeing the drunk homeless people who have puked all over themselves."
"I was surprised. I did think I was handsome, though, lol. "
Have no fear! It was only a request! I never completed this order.
Glass half full. I like it. 
"I once bought my girlfriend a kg bag of turquoise M&amp;Ms whilst on holiday in NYC. She ate the entire bag in one sitting and 6-10 hours later was immensely proud when showing me her bright turquoise dunks.

She is now my wife."
"What was the one thing you really wanted to do and thought you never could, and have you done it now?"
Have you looked at the wonders of the world (even just a picture) yet? I imagine it would be kinda hard to grasp with out sight. Also how was it learning to go from brail to the English alphabet for reading?
congratulations to be able to see beauty. What will happen to your guide dog tho? Will it retire and become a normal home dog or will it serve another person? 
Jesus christ 
I had at first. I had to touch things to know what they are called. 
"I have. I thought I would be kicked out of there because I automatically wanted to touch everything but you're not supposed to touch anything in a museum, lol. I don't think I have a favorite artist, at least not for now. "
Wahh I hope you get to go on more adventures with your friends! I'm so excited for you I don't even know why
"I find this extremely fascinating. There is no way non-blind people can “visualize” absolute abstract concepts such as nothingness or infinite and I’ve never thought that blind people actually could get to fully comprehend the concept of nothingness but then not being able to explain it. When I think of the concept of nothingness I think of it as that part in my sleep when I’m not dreaming. My vital functions are on but I get to remember nothing at all during those hours. Thanks a lot for this AMA, I’m loving it and also you made my day."
Have you ever had someone show up not knowing what it was? There was a beach that had clothing optional days during certain times of the month and we discovered this when there were lots of nudists walking around during my friend's kid's first birthday party.
I'm an 18 year old virgin lmao
"Haha. I wish. I’m very spartan, so I’m able to spend on the important things. "
Thank you. One last question: Has being able to see made night/day more pronounced and your internal schedule more “natural” (does that make sense?) so your body is more in tune?
I mean what’s the worst that could happen? You go megablind?
My girlfriend does it more than I do
"The faces of my loved ones and friends, people who have been there for me my whole life. I was surprised at pretty much how everything looked like, even though people had described many things to me, it was very hard for me to make a picture of it in my head and every single picture that I had made turned out completely wrong. "
Were you hesitant to get the surgery ? As it would be life changing . Or were you all on board from the get go ?
"Sight, definitely. "
"No. Since i am a gamer. I knew that this was all in good fun. I'm into FPS type of games (Halo, Destiny, Fallout...etc.)

I actually got the Inclement weather armor in Halo Reach. so...I still play games quite a bit!"
Your  a legend i sent  u the credit card numbers of my whole family tree
Are you okay?
"It's not nearly as common as people expect, it's easily the #1 reservation most males have about visiting but it's almost a non issue. Mostly past adolescence it's not common at all. If you do get an erection, just cover up somehow and let it pass, nobody will be even a little bothered that it's happened. "
Did your guide dog look like how you pictured? Does he understand that now he is a pet and doesn’t have to work anymore?
"Well, I don't think he has realized I don't need him as a guide dog anymore. He still walks in front of me and leads me when we go outside. "
No sympathy 
"The light, I think. My eyes were very sensitive to the light for a good while and even on cloudy days, I had to wear sunglasses when going outside. "
"I can’t wrap my head around seeing for the first time after 21 years of life. I don’t want to waste your time getting philosophical, so I’ll ask my question- What were things you enjoyed when blind but now that you can see them, you don’t enjoy as much or you just look at it in a different way? No pun intended."
I bet! Thank you for sharing with us. It’s fascinating to think how much different the world was to you when you had no sight. Is there any animal that was shocking to see what they actually looked like? 
"That's so awesome :D I'm sure people describing how things looked to you before you got the surgery was a hard concept to grasp (like I've seen people try to describe what it is like to be blind to people who aren't blind, I've heard it's not darkness, but almost like if you held your hand over your eyes?) 

Very, very happy for you :) 
 
"
"Yes, of course, I have seen a lot of movies. My favorite ones are probably the Terminator series. "
When you have BBQ does the cook wear an apron ?
"ok, this has to be asked.. Hows the sex?"
What are your long-term plans now?
A couple hundred in the last two weeks. It's all I'm doing these days and I have 200+ orders in queue. I think the trend will die down over the next few weeks but I'm thankful for the business and it's fun to make!
Oddest thing asked for?

"Never too late. I was 30 when I finally started a path. I was 39 before I received my undergrad and 39 for the masters all while single parenting and working full time. No student loans. Worked my ass off. I’m mid 60’s still work and have reached a comfortable spot financially. So it’s time to give some back now. 

You keep going. Nobody says there is age requirements for certain skill development. Look, research fields, and start a path no matter how slow. A practical nursing program takes 1 year in the US if you have a high soil diploma or even a GED. Keep giving yourself positive talk; read in your spare time; strive. You will find your path. Good luck human!"

"Well, I just continued wiping until I was sure I was clean. It’s generally not too difficult to tell when you’re clean based on how it feels. Essentially you just pay attention to how easily toilet paper slides across your butt. Rougher glide is cleaner. That might sound ridiculous but that's how I did it."
"My mom was. Not in any super crazy way though. My older sister got some of hers and reacted very badly to the shots, but she was also a very sensitive child. My mom decided not to finish my sisters and to not give me any at all. She believes that they aren't really necessary in most instances. My dad just went along with her I think. 

Funny part is now she's a paramedic, so she had to have all her vaccines updated for work."
"Obviously religious, just look at OP’s username. "

"Well, you just treat a blind person like everyone else. I can just give a few tips about my experience. 

Don't assume they need help with everything, because, for the most part, they don't. Blind people are used to living the way they live and it used to annoy me a lot when people wanted to do everything for me. I know they meant well but I wasn't as helpless as they thought I was.

If you speak, speak directly to them, not to their companion. It happened sometimes that people would ask questions about me to my parents even though I was right there and could have answered them myself. Unless the person is also hard of hearing, they can usually speak for themselves. There were people who literally shouted in my face instead of talking normally. There were also some people who thought I'm weak in the head just because I was blind.

If they have a guide animal with them, don't touch the animal, don't pet it, etc. It's not just a pet, it's a service animal and should not be distracted. "

2 years.
"&gt;Yes, the world is much bigger than I had imagined it and there's so much to see. When I left the hospital, my head was going to all directions because so much was happening on the streets.

Do you have trouble processing what you are seeing or is it just natural and immediately realize what you are looking at?"

"I just didn't know what it was. It would be the same as if you saw something you have never seen before and had no idea what it was. For me, the idea was in m head but I had to touch the thing for it to come out. "
