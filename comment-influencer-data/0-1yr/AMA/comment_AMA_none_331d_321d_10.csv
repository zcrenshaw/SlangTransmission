"i have no questions, but i'd like to say that i'm proud of you for sticking up for your niece."
Congrats - you just had your first orgasm!!!!
"As a person who was adopted and in a similar situation as your niece, all I can say is thank you. 

You're and amazing person. "
"Probably one of those storys you see on reddit. \*Im a paramedic AMA\*. Anyways that aside, glad you're ok. better that your well now than them finding you unconscious or dead in your living room naked with all your toys laying around. "
"This is an easy one: own it. You're the only one that can make yourself feel any way about it. You have to choose shame, so don't. You said it best yourself, 'self love'. It's that simple. No one can shame you but yourself, and there's nothing wrong with what you were doing. The end. 

To paraphrase the lovely Julia Child, NEVER APOLOGIZE. Do not twist yourself into knots of excuses and explanations. 

Show yourself a little love and move on. And enjoy self care Sundays with gusto! Good vibes ;) 

Edit: Gold! Wowserz! Thanks! "
Oh god that’s mean lol
" So you're *not* tempted to ask around your family ""What happened to my favourite butt plug?"" then?"
"Voice of experience talking here. Don't wait, do the adoption right away and terminate her parental rights, and get loose of your F'ed up sister, or one day she is going to figure out a way to regain custody solely for the purpose of attempting to extort drug money from you."
"Two butt plugs, one largish realistic looking black dildo ( not sure why the color matters, but it probably does to someone involved here). Couple different lubes, nipple pumps (they probably have no idea what those are) and an Aneros.  This was all wrapped up in a towel and placed in my room by either my mother or my sister.   The smaller of the two butt plugs is ""missing.""  I have several theories.   1) it was in me when I called 911 and they have a protocol of not ""returning"" such a thing. 2) I did something with it in a panic and I'll end up finding it in a drawer the next time I move or 3) my freaky sister took it.   I know that last one sounds crazy, but it's like a 1% idea and would not completely surprise me."
Thank you. I appreciate that. I hope things got better for you. 
"Thank you for sharing your story.  A lot of people don't understand that hardships of state adoption/fostering. Rules designed to help parents regain custody of their children also increase the burden on the child and foster/adopting parents. Given the opportunity would you pursue an option for full, unrestrained custody? Have you looks into any possibilities?"
"Yes. My husband and I are carrying on as if she's not involved at all and we are currently in the process of becoming her licensed foster parents. I do hope to adopt her someday, although part of me wants to leave that decision up to her provided the state terminates my sister's parental rights. "
"You’re a kinky guy! Own it! Might as well be ‘out’ about whatever it is you’re into. Have fun with it. Let THEM be embarrassed. Invite THEM to be as open minded as you.

And then thank them for saving your life and loving you.

EDIT: I realized this is an AMA so I’ll add a couple questions to my unsolicited advice:

How many sex toys did you have out anyway? 

Have you considered writing a self-love ‘how-to’ book?"
We’ve seen worse. Once got called to “an attempted suicide via bleed out” I’m hauling ass because I’m thinking slit wrists. Nope dude cut his dick off. 
"Sure, although I'm no good at pitches. 

It's about a 'royal' gardener who sucks shit at everything walking around post-apocalyptic feudal Phoenix, Arizona with his friend who doesn't suck shit at anything. [Mostly sad and surreal] Antics ensue and all that. Mostly character driven, not focused on plot too much. "
She’ll probably want to come back when the newness of whatever she’s doing now wears off. Don’t let her when that happens.
"Well, better for them.   I would not have known the difference.   Not that I at all wish that had been the outcome. But it did make me think about the other things I might have that people would discover if I did die suddenly.   "
Typically it's with sex.
I love that not a single question was answered. Thank you. It’s definitely what I imagined Alzheimer’s to be like. 
"Oh, yeah...sorry.   32, M, straight.   Live-in girlfriend of 6 years who was thankfully out of town on travel.   She knows I had the TIA and went to the ER, but I think that's all.   She is good friends with my youngest sister (not the one who was at my house) so she could know something, but we're pretty open, so I think she would have said something.   I do intend to tell her, but it's just been a lot."
"""nipple pumps (they probably have no idea what those are)""  

Unless they were on reddit on that fateful day."
Plot twist - it's in the turkey.
"I'm literally in tears reading this. I'm so sorry this happened to you, but from a comedic standpoint this is the best thing I've read in a while. I can only imagine the feelings you had knowing this was out in the open and your family has to know it all now too. Good luck moving on!"
I am seriously expecting that I get sex toys for Christmas this year.
I had a dentist try that. I told them that my wisdom teeth are fine and never went back. I went to a different dentist a week later and they commented on how I was really lucky that my wisdom teeth didn't need to be taken out. 
"She’s been diagnosed with a lot of things. Most commonly with ADHD, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder. While I am in no way educated to diagnose anyone, I worked in a state mental health institution for years and definitely think that she has borderline personality disorder.

I should note that now that she is an addict, that is the only part they want to address. Unfortunately, that is not her biggest issue."
"It’ll be along the lines of “I’m going to take that child in whatever legal way I can, but if you give me cash I’ll fuck off until I run out.” "
"OOO that reminds me. We got a call for a ""hemorrhage"" last winter. No other information.

Dude was bangin his pull out couch, some wire or metal from this ragged and ripped couch caught him, left a nasty gash on his bald headed yogurt slinger. Walk in with our bags, poor dude sitting next to his freshly lubed (now with blood) bang hole, stark naked as the day he was born, power grasping his junk with a towel. That was an interesting narrative. "
"I feel like I have to buy all new toys regardless.   There's something just not-cum inducing about the following thought:  ""Hey, this is the dildo I was fucking myself with on the day I had that stroke and I traumatized my family.""   Plus, someone DM'd me and offered to buy the dildo for $100 postage paid, I shit you not."
The seed is strong.
"Go to darkamazon.com. Enter your stepfathers credit card information. Sign up for darkprime, drugs arrive in two days to doorstep which you pick up before parents get home. "
"Yeah, I don't know. He was in a relationship with one of them, but the other two? I have *no* clue. "
Makes for a good Thanks-giving dinner conversation
Don’t let her back in. Seriously. 
I mean they’d probably leave you alone unless their cubs were around.
"Growing up our family was not well off. Although we did not live in financial poverty, I always knew our family was not financially secure and had a financial burden. 

Winning the lottery has quite literally set me free from all burdens financially. Coming into a large sum of money the way I did could have led me down paths unimaginable but with the family I had I was able to make the right decisions and to this day not have a single regret post lottery winning. "
Quite honestly nothing... I’ve lived a lavish but responsible life with no financial burden. Travelled the world and have done literally whatever I wanted to do. 
Can ya give me a brief description of the book?
"Hmmm, I would think 3-4 more bears would do the trick "
"""Bald headed yogurt slinger"" is now going to be worked into my conversations, thank you "
"The eldest was taken away from her when she was 18 months old, but not before she had to endure terrible things. She has lived with her dad ever since and is now a teenager. We adore him and his new wife and they're at every family function we have. She still suffers though and gets bullied for not having her mom in her life. The middle child lives with her meth-addicted father. My 80-year-old grandparents help take care of her half the time and are attempting to get custody of her but to no avail. She definitely exhibits signs of abuse but social services is so overworked, you need hardcore proof before the child is removed from the home. I report something new at least once a month. "
"This scenario reminds me of wedding singer movie,, when he wrote a song to his girlfriend a d half way into the song he hates her. Quite catchy song"
You can use dildos and be straight. Gay people can use pocket-vaginas as well without being straight.
"July 14, 2016, Bastille Day. Nice, France.

Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, a Tunisian living in France for a long time, divorced, had kids, rented a white ice cream van in Saint-Laurent-du-Var about a week prior. He stuffed it to the brim with broken firearms (don't ask me why). Then, he waited for the right moment.

At 10:56 PM, he drove through the plastic barrier on the Promenade des Anglais, which was signifying it is not a good idea to drive there as there are tens of thousands of people celebrating, which is what he was counting on.

He zig-zagged on the Promenade to kill as many as possible. He succeeded in killing 86 and injuring over 400, of which 50 seriously (with lifelong consequences).

I had some serious luck that day as I didn't die or lose anyone there. I was, however, standing just a few feet from people who did lose their lives. He drove past with tremendous speed.

We were shocked. Then, we ran into the Palais Royale, and the kind employees brought us some water. Then, they led us through the back door to the street parallel with the Promenade so we could get home safely.

That's what I remember."
Believe it or not I’m finishing the same degree I started prior to winning the lottery. 
Scarily easy. A 15 year old could do it. As long as you know the steps it's as easy as ordering something from Amazon.
How neat is that?!
Hard to deny that it would be a good feeling.. I couldn't imagine the rest of my life without her.. but I am forcing myself to adjust.
"The second shot fractured and seperated my femur and nicked my femoral vein (40 cal FMJ will do that to a leg...). The first cop that showed up stuck his fingers in my leg to find and stop the vein from bleeding out. The EMT later said his actions saved my life. (had about 4 minutes left to live if he wouldn't have done that)

They caught the shooter along with the 3 others who ransacked the house. whats sad is 3 of them were under 16 years old.  "
Probably your Dad
Thank you.   Glad it made you laugh..I was hoping at least the world could share my pain with some giggling at least.
Has she been diagnosed with any mental illness??? If so what is it?
Too soon 😂
"Hahah buying out the inventory of a girls scout troop sounds like something I’m going to have to do ASAP! 

I’ve always enjoyed giving back and generous acts. I’ve given generous tips multiple times (to those who’s service was deserving, not by appearance..) and have payed the tab of the entire restaurant/bar a couple times. Bought out inventory of street vendors overseas a couple times without taking their inventory (got a sweet spot for old people that clearly live in poverty). Have fed homeless people and such. 

Not anything significant but always try to find ways to make other people’s days when possible!"
"Nah, I don't hate her, she hates me (I think), which is probably why she cheated. "
How much more would it take to get you full drunk ?
"Not to play the petty game, but let’s play the petty game. 

She calls you, what do you do?
You don’t answer. You not answering establishes your control over the situation.

She wants to come back because new and sparkly is dull and disappointing, what do you do? You wish her well and say that you need space to get over her. If you need her for anything you’ll reach out. Keep her away from your happiness and letting her affect your healing. 

Your very next goal is to heal. You can only heal by separating yourself from the thing hurting you. I hope that you understand that and practice it. (I write strongly worded letters and never send them. The act of writing them is very cathartic, though)

Keep on truckin, friend."

This is fuckin hilarious when its not happening to me.

"What about your oldest sibling? 

Would you/ have you ever consider making it so your sister can not contact you or your neice?"
"Thank you. I've dealt with my own set of demons over the years, but we all have. I’m a better person for it. "
"Yeah, I like stuff in my ass.  The GF is ok with it 'sometimes' and not to the same extent a I would like.   She does the finger thing pretty much all the time, and has fucked me with ""her"" dildo quite a bit, which I like...but I really get off from extended slow fucking with the dildo and that usually means I'm doing it alone.   She knows I'm into ""butt stuff"" however not to the extent of being so organized about it."

"Aside from saying that my older sister taking her full-time wasn’t the best option, I don’t want to explain further why it had to be me, that’s her story to tell.

And I can’t yet. The state that I live in gives certain rights to the parents even in situations like this. She has a right to see her, regardless of how I feel about it and also more important, regardless of how it affects the child. My husband and I are carrying on as if my sister is not involved though and we hope that the state will involuntarily terminate her parental rights. That can take a long time though, because anytime she decides to come back and do some of the things that she is supposed to, the whole thing basically start over again. It’s pretty fucked. "
"If you remain in the system as foster parents, DCS has the ability to remove and rehome her as they see fit. It is a far, far more unstable situation than you probably realize.

"You sold meh, thanks &lt;3 Best of luck with the breakup, currently listening to Simon &amp; Garfunkel - Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme. Pretty soothing, maybe it will heal some of those wounds you've gathered aswell."
"'Cause I'm a stupid sentimental idiot, and I love her, and I wanted to be romantic, so I wrote a book for her and dedicated it to her, and paid for an editor, and a cover artist, and was set to release physical copies, and boom, she gets some dick on vacation. Lesson learned. Don't do nice things for people, especially when they are pretty girls. "
"Troll or not, I'm giggling that there's no responses."
"No. I really believe that she never developed a conscience. It's been brought up and she's proud of it. She thinks it's funny. Now, though, she's 100 lbs and 5’2”, while I, on the other hand, am 5’10 and 145 lbs. She hasn't stood a chance in years, and eventually stopped trying but that's probably more due to the lack of contact than anything. Now that I have her daughter though, I envision her trying to get her back when she's all strung out on drugs so that's always in the back of my mind."
How many times is too many to attempt the murder of a sibling? Asking for a friend
"So, I own an Adult Family Home and take care of people with mental and/or physical disabilities and hope to continue opening as many as I can. After working in a state mental health institution for years, I wouldn't wish that on anybody. It was a terrible place to work and there wasn't any real treatment going on. The health care system itself needs to change, until then, I'm just hoping to do my part by taking care of as many people as I possibly can through my business. "
"No. He is the one guy out of the 4 that still hasn't come to terms with what he did. He has written me a few times from prison, but you can tell from the letters that he doesn't think he is to blame. I hope one day I recieve a letter from him that shows he has owned up to his actions. Then maybe I will write back. "
A porn buddy is someone who you trust taht when you die (or have a stroke) goes to your house and is responsible with deleting all your porn and clean up your sex toys or pull the dildo out of your ass so family doesn't see that. 
"I think I would actually like it better if they WERE teasing me.   They are just saying enough to let me know they know, but not really getting anything out in the open.

"2 teen knocked on my door, I answered thinking they were selling something, they said their car broke down and they needed a jack. I told them I don't have a jack, but could give them a ride. at that moment, one of the them pulled a gun from his waist and pointed it at my head. He eventually moved it to my leg, shot, I got up, he moved the gun to the other leg, shot, and thats when I went down. 2 more teens joined them and they entered into my home. My wife was giving my 6 mo old daughter a bath in our kitchen sink and ran to the back deck to dial 911. The shooter saw her on the phone and took two shots, both barely missing. He caught up to her and pointed the gun to her head and asked for the phone, then ran off. the others stole a laptop, kindle, iPhone, and a few other non-important items."

"My sister and I don't live in the same county and she doesn't have a car of her driver's license, so she has to be transported by a social worker. Then we meet in a public place in my city. That's one part of the visitations that I'm satisfied with!"
"There are a bunch of nerve endings in men’s butts, to be more blunt than scientific. It doesn’t make you gay to get pleasure that your body is literally wired for from your butt.

"I was with a woman for 6 years, got married and found out 7 months in she had been cheating for the last 2 years. We divorced and a year later I met the love of my life, got married, and we are currently in the hospital awaiting the arrival of our first child.

"I know this is probably a contentious idea but I really think it was a bad decision to start shutting down mental health institutions in the 80s without any sort of well-though-out backup plan for what to do with the people that were institutionalized.  What happened in North America as a result is a large population of mentally ill homeless, some of whom are dangerous to themselves or others.

Integration works well for many but I think there are some people who truly can't function in society and there needs to be a place for them."

"Yeah... I did this. Thought I was cool shit for having my wisdom teeth all fully grown in. Skip ahead 8 years and I'm having some terrible tooth pain but it's definitely not my wisdom teeth since the pain is everywhere but back there. Dentist is baffled, keeps recommending I get those sucker's removed,  I'm a stubborn asshole and refuse... couple days later it hurts so bad that I haven't slept since the visit,  I submit and have them ripped out(only now I have to wait 2 months for an opening)... the pain goes away instantly and completely, my sensitive teeth that I thought were just another annoyance of adulthood and spendy toothpaste, gone.

"So, the butt plugs are different sizes...one goes in pretty easily without much thought/buildup.  I then dildo myself for a while.   Sometimes I can hands-free orgasm from that, but usually, I'll work in the larger plug and then manually masturbate which feels great.   The two lubes are simple.   I use J-Lube for things that go in the ass, and Silicone based Gun Oil or Swiss Navy (basically the same thing) for my hand/penis.    But yes, I do experience a fairly predictable post-cum depression as I can't just nod off and go to sleep, but have to clean up all the gear.  Always feels pretty stupid.   Sometimes, I'll stop mid session, clean and tidy everything other than what I have decided I really want for my final fun, and then there is less to deal with post-ejac.   I'm always glad I did that.   Plus, I am often high while doing all this, which makes all the custodial stuff even more difficult and undesirable."

Your lesson learned probably shouldn't be 'don't ever do anything nice for anyone again, especially if they're pretty' but 'just hold back a bit until I feel sure about this next one'.

 (You may have been with your ex for years and felt absolutely sure, in which case what I'm saying won't mean much. My point is, one experience doesn't define every experience you'll have and the fact you did something so nice says a lot about you. Focus on to your own -lovely - actions, not her shitty ones)."
"Nope, in a regular envelope. You could never distinguish them from regular mail, with rare exception"
That kinda makes sense now 
"Phew, they just put their pitchforks down."
"How do u know it was the dark web 

#WITH NO DW"
has she ever shown any remorse? apologized? does the fact that she tried to kill you so often never come up in conversation?
Did you have any symptoms leading up to the stroke? 
Why you gotta bring religion into simply being a good person?
Why did she wait until 30 for a license? 
"Well it bad and needed. Sorting. I wasn't too bothered as it didn't pain me and I didn't want to pay for it. But I got it for free thanks to NHS so all good.

"Yeah, pretty expensive for someone who throws most of his money out for sneakers. "
Daaaamn! He took a shot at your wife and you’re “friends with his family??” That’s fucking ridiculous. Is he in prison for the rest of his god damn life?
What was the final straw for you?
"&gt;I was discharged a few hours later

I bet."

What are the steps?"
Sounds like “adulting” is about to smash him into sadness pulp...
"I know it shouldn't be, but the fact that somebody must've already used the name throwawaymicropenis1 is fucking hilarious"

Those lucky basterds are sleeping! 
Why would you write a book *For* her in the first place? 
"I mean, it's true. I could make double the money selling to strangers and I don't. I lower the prices and make it accessible.

the gangs in my area are violent and not everyone wants to deal with them, I offer an alternative way"
Thank you for doing this! I couldn't truly understand what this actually meant until I experienced opiate addiction myself.

"Well, they've built those ""poles"" alongside the pedestrian area of the promenade, added more palm trees and changed the surface of the pedestrian area. I believe they've also made the Promenade a lane narrower.

In the parallel street, they built a tram.

Overall, the place is pretty neat now, and I keep going there with my family every year."
"Do you not hate her because it's hard to hate someone you love, or do you not hate her because you feel it's a waste of energy/time and is simply not worth it?"
"This statement hits me hard. Glad you're not suffering financially, too. #isAmerican"
Because it is embawwassing

Probably just look like you’ve got a rich parents and you’re an only child to the other students 
"A dealer used the money I gave him to shoot a child on my doorstep. On the same week another friend got robbed for $400 by his dealer. I said fuck it after my friend collapsed after taking laced cocaine at a party.

It wasn't easy though and I get anxiety attacks from it sometimes.

The legal repercussions aren't worth it, but the moral benefit and safety of my friends are, I'm an empathetic person. Why let people suffer when I can help."

Because they say they haven't had sex with anyone else. And I kinda believe them after his slimy ass :D
"Medical bills, bankruptcy, etc you name it. I understand I have more money than I’ll ever need in my life but I don’t feel an obligation to help absolute strangers.. "
"It’s definitely unfair. There’s not a lot of help out there for my sister either, so I have a feeling we have a long journey ahead of us. "
"Please ensure that the visits are always conducted with the proper supervision, and that the situation is held in a safe environment. I grew up very very close to the Powell house. "
"I don't. In my opinion, there is no way to anticipate something like this. Whatever measures you take, someone can and will find a way to get around and/or exploit them."
"I don't anymore; my PTSD started about 18 months after the attack, and went away after another 5 or 6."
"It was her birthday on the 16th. I purposely didn't reach out.. she has a couple reasons to reach out to me.. the lawyer sent a letter asking her to respond for a divorce agreement, which she had not.. and a dresser of hers remains in my house.. I said I'd drop it off because she didn't have help moving her stuff out ( She assumed I'd help her move her things out I presume) she never asked for it yet..

Seems like it!

"Kind of an asshole move, that the name of the condition which makes you unable to pronounce Rs starts with an R, isn't it? Like how would you explain this to someone IRL? "
Buy a burner laptop for like $100. 
"It's very similar to holding hands, just not hands."
"Pretty much non existent. I am a very fit, decent looking man, so I can pick up women at the bar. But once the pants come off they either laugh, or never come back. One chick I was with for a few months loved oral, but I think she needed a real man."
"How did you get introduced to the family?
"
What’s happened with her other kids?
"Well, I mean, she's good in every way except for the promiscuous whore part, and I think that part can be mitigated in a lot of people, but yeah, thanks. 

Thank you for the kind words. Hearing stuff like this really helps. "

Your parents would willingly pay for your apartment? God I was born into the wrong family. Any chance they want to adopt a 20 year old?
