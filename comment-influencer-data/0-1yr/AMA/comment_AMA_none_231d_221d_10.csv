You're such a noob
"Hahaha, found the eleven year redditor!  
Greetings, old man!"
"Hello from Wisconsin. No questions, just wanted to agree that it is so cold that my spit froze instantly. Power went out for a few hours last night. Let’s hope that doesn’t happen again. Stay warm my friend."
Do you know any students that also use reddit? Do they know you use reddit?
Polar vortex and probably something to do with that damn groundhog. 
Instantly. Tested. 
"I honestly have no idea. I know of a few student's youtube accounts because they have shared them with me, but reddit isn't even a conversation piece in schools. Obviously with the size and popularity of this glorious site I have no doubt there is a good amount that do."
How long does it take for your spit to freeze? 
Hmmm. I should make a list. I’ll come back a little later with it!
"I know lots of blind people who are incredibly racist. Racism is of course linked to the colour of someone's skin, but it's got far more to do with hatred of a group that you don't belong to. And blind people can be just as hateful and judgemental as sighted people. 

I obviously think racism is horrible, but I'd be lying if I said blind people were excluded from it."
"Almost everything is closed. The mail isn’t coming, schools closed, most restaurants, and so on. Public transport is super limited. "
"So this is really interesting because I'm on a group for parents of blind kids, and someone asked how to teach their blind child this. Up until that point I had no idea that sighted people actually look at the paper, that's just so weird to me. 

Not really sure how to explain it. You just know by how the paper feels against your skin. "
"Beep boop Beep boop reddit has shut down

Error 404: Not found"
Reddit is like fight club. First rule is not to talk about it 
Please...

"Yes, I've always passively used echolocation. So that is naturally picking up on sounds around me without actually making the clicking sound. But when I was 14 I was lucky enough to meet Daniel Kish who taught me how to refine the technique. I wish I was more proficient, it's definitely something I want to dedicate more time to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm frequently surprised by how much I don't know, and often I only find out that I don't know something when I physically encounter it. I always knew, for example that a giraffe was really tall. But once I went to the zoo and I was able to touch the leg of one and I was amazed that this was as far as I could reach, because I'd never realised quite how tall they were!"
"So I had to actually think about this question for a moment. I guess that means you get brownie points. 

When I think about empathy, and how it's described, like a way to sense other emotions. In a form, I can sense how people are feeling, but I can't care. It doesn't connect, and in many ways, I think it's liberating. I won't care about some insignificant 30 second thing, whereas someone can milk it for sympathy for days. 

For example, when I was working at a gas station, a woman was prepaying her gas with coins, so I let her use my fuel points for points off of a gallon. She had told me she lost her debt card, and I let her use my points, because it seemed like the nice thing to do. I didn't care that she was in a predicament, I just didn't want to hear her bitch about it. Someone, or well most people, with empathy would sympathize with her, I just wanted her to shut up and leave. 

In conclusion, I think not having empathy is actually a good thing. I can move on with my life."
"Music! I've taught a year and a half as a Middle School choir, and I just switched to an Elementary position. I also work with my district's Marching Band."
Too cold for that shit. 
No- only Apple Jacks so far. 
Going into a homeless shelter that had a great support system and good connections and introduced me to a certain program. Not only that but it took myself to get the drive to pick myself up and succeed no matter what for my own future.
I learnt to touch type when I was around five years old. And I use software called a screenreader (literally does what the name says) and navigate using keystrokes rather than a mouse.
"I no longer tell people about reddit because they insist on giving them my username, for some stupid fucking reason &gt;:C"
What are your favourite subreddits?
Why is it so cold?
Well my parents were both very shitty people and all around made my life hell (mental and verbal abuse ect.) so one day I said fuck it and left home
"That sucks dude, make yourself some hot chocolate, here’s my recipe

"It was a combination of things. Daily therapy in the beginning, isolating myself from people that were using &amp; honestly, weed lmao for the withdrawals "
Other kids didn't want to play with me because I laughed when they got hurt.
"Any events cancelled for you today, work/school?"
How do you know you wiped enougth after number 2? Serious curiosity 
"Hi there, Psychological &amp; Brain Sciences Major here and I am doing some work on empathy in my free time. 

From your perspective, does empathy or the ability to entirely “take on” the content of someone’s emotions seem to be a hinderance or enhancement in the grand scheme of living as a primarily private entity (with a mind exclusive to himself)?"
"I haven't because I don't want vision. Whilst regaining vision can be a good experience for people who lost their sight, the few people who have been blind from birth or early childhood who underwent these kinds of procedures found it really traumatic. We don't know a lot about brains still, but there is evidence that suggest the brains of people born blind adapt to having no vision, and so our pathways don't quite form in the same way. So we don't actually know how to interpret all that visual information."
"It's so weird, but all trips are I guess. Mine were all auditory, so listening to music was a really intense experience. Time felt really distorted and the air around me felt like a physical, vibrating presence. I had one very funny trip where me and my friend laughed about all kinds of shit for hours. But I've also had a bad trip where my anxiety was high and I felt like demons were trying to talk to me. I found having my dog next to me was quite comforting because she was a very reassuring, non-threatening presence."

"Have you tried echolocation? 

When you near objects that are very large how often are you surprised by the shape and dimensions? "

"I don't. I have what you could describe as a vague, abstract interest in colour. But not a favourite because I can't conceptualise it enough."
"Pro tip: Go buy a super soaker. Fill it with water. Become Sub-Zero from Mortal Combat. 

Be careful with how you wield these new super powers. "
"Well, the questions about feelings were a bit amusing, because I have no idea how I could even begin to think in terms of menial things like sadness and happiness. Having said that, for the most part, this experience is alright. It's got some questions that are more interesting than others, and thankfully a lot less edgelords than I expected."

"Thank you, my guide dog is the same. She loves to play when we are at home but in harness she just wants to focus."

"Don't have a question, just wanted to to comment. My father is blind and had a Seeing Eye dog named Bishop. I am amazed at how Bishop is a regular dog when he in around the house but as soon as you put his harness on, he means business. Its amazing how service animals help people. Have a good night!"
"For the short term my main goal is to graduate highschool, after that I'm looking to hopefully be able to put myself through college as somehow through all this I've managed to keep my grades up "
"Yes, I've tried lsd."
Do you like long walks on the beach?
"Mainly I think it was too much of a niche market. It was a turn based free to play game, so think Clash of Clans, but also MMA themed. So the audience wasn't as casual, it was for people who understood and liked turn based strategy, but they also needed to understand the world of MMA, to an extent. Active users was high at first but didn't stay that way for long. Also, outgoings were far too high - a team of 20 people working on a new starter at a new studio, is unheard of in the industry (for a reason). There's a few other things too. "
What turned it around 
"Obviously your answers are very interesting to all of us, but are our questions at all interesting to you? How is this ama going for you? Do you find it boring like the many other things you've mentioned?"
Agreed. Only among my closest friends has reddit use even ever come up in conversation.
"I don't. Visuals aren't something my brain can even conceptualise. For example I might know that grass is green, but it's just a fact and nothing more."
"The teachers and general public are starting to get the ball rolling in the right direction, but overall it's very broken. While I support and understand the need for standardized tests, it's very wrong that schools and students are almost completely judged on their ability based solely on the results from those tests. The tests should be used as a guideline on what schools need to put focus on, but not used for how the Govt. sends out funding and grant favorability. 

On top of that, teachers pay is WAY low. I realize that we do get three months off every year on top of the other breaks we get. I don't believe that we should be getting paid $80,000 per year as a start, but most schools start between $35,000-$45,000 per year. The ""Middle class"" in the USA range starts around household incomes of $40,000. At no point should the people educating the youth of our country be paid what is considered to be ""lower class."" Starting rates for teachers should be (in my opinion) $50,000 minimum."

Blind guy does better AMA than 95% of AMA'rs
I don't think so. I have led a pretty tame and boring life both online and offline.
"I don't remember ever not knowing that I was blind and other people were sighted. Perhaps this was a difficult concept for me as a really small child but I'm not sure. I always understood that people could see, but I didn't really understand the mechanics of sight. A good example would be that I was amazed when I found out that if you are up high, for example on top of a hill or a tall building, you can see for miles. That's such a strange concept even though I now understand the science behind it."

"Considering they had two other kids, both they were vocal about liking better, I'm sure they're getting on just fine. They always made a big deal about how I'm some broken child, then when I moved out they wanted to use ""but we love you"" as a reason for me to not move on with my life. I don't really know, or understand what the issue was. I was never violent, loud, or particularly rude. I just made it very clear I don't give a shit."

"I don't like leaving my house if I don't have to. I didn't go to my graduation ceremony, prom, and the only wedding I went to only had 20 other attendees. I'm not the best for this question, however I can say that I don't try to ruin a positive atmosphere. If the mood is happy, I'll put on a smile, but it's a politeness thing. If I'm being a prick, my life will be more difficult than it needed to be. 
I don't really have much experience in party based activity though, so I may have entirely missed the point of the question."
"It was very dramatized and the therapist was overly generalizing. He did what he had to do for views, and I don't really care about it. Some sociopaths are killers, most are not. All are treated like killers."
"I would recommend for everyone to check free testosterone, because total testosterone could be very high (700-1000) and you could still have low testosterone symptoms.

"Yes, I've definitely felt the pain of exclusion. Every single day I have to contend with ignorance and sometimes outright discrimination and it's absolutely the hardest thing about being blind. People decide that because I'm blind I am somehow less capable and this has horrible consequences when I am doing things like applying for a job. I think the way people perceive blindness is far more of an issue than my blindness itself.

I was bullied as a child. I was kind of nerdy and when you combine that with being blind I was the perfect target for bullying. Kids can be really mean."

No matter how much I try to put that knee-jerk emotional reaction on the back burner, I'm constantly gritting my teeth with every feeling I take in from the outside world.

"Mental health clinician here. No it doesn't. He's describing apathy while soaking in the attention of an AMA. If I had to put money on it,  I'd say he's just a bored kid who thinks he's very smart (which maybe he is.) Antisocial personality disorder typically comes with high impulsivity and an inability to deeply and meaningfully process consequences. This leads to ANTI-social behavior such as violence and other crimes. Not Asocial behaviors like not caring about a lady losing her debit card. "
"I definitely think I'm as much of a victim (if you want to call it that) of conventional beauty standards as everyone else can be. We all consume culture even if it's not visually, so I learnt from a young age what was expected of me and my body and definitely felt like I had to conform to that. But I do feel like my judgement of other people is altered by my blindness. That's not to say we as blind people don't judge, we do. But it's not going to be as immediate as it is for sighted people, because I might not know things like a persons physical build until I am close to them. Whereas for a sighted person it's the first thing they see.

&amp;#x200B;

I have things that I look for in a partner in the same way as sighted people do. I guess the difference is I'm going to access that information in a different way. I'm probably going to get more hung up about things like physical build, height etc than I would someone's eye colour because I can't see it so it's just not an issue. I often wonder how much of my judgements are formed by what my culture tells me is attractive, but I guess we all have to deal with that."
"I’m glad to hear I provoked some good metacognition! Thanks for the detailed response, I’ve been intrigued by and lurked on AMAs like this but you felt the most genuine in your demeanor. 

As someone with hyper-empathetic qualities I often envy that nonchalant attitude towards the emotional turmoils of others—it so often, as you said, seems like we’re all just quietly annoyed that someone needs US to listen to THEM instead of being the person that gets to vent all of their concerns to whoever is willing to join them in their emotional experience of the event. 

Are there ever instances where you find yourself confused by the more positively-valenced group experiences of emotion, such as at concerts or music festivals? I would assume by your previous answers you might not be the most outgoing, let’s-go-stand-in-a-massive-crowd-for-hours kind of person, but even in say, graduation ceremonies or weddings, does it feel like there’s a component missing to the atmosphere for you? Or is the annoyance the predominant thought most of the time in those circumstances?"

I am bothered most by how people treat me. Random people will grab hold of me when I am walking around because they assume that I'm blind so mustn't know where I'm going. I don't even look lost, I'm just walking along, maybe heading to class or something. If I pull away or ask them to stop touching me they most often act angry or offended, like I should be thankful that they are helping me, even though I don't actually need help. People act like that because I have a visible disability I don't deserve the same respect or personal space as other people.

&amp;#x200B;

I am also often treated like a child rather than an adult. A good example of this happened recently in a train station. I asked a tourist for directions to the taxi pickup point because I didn't know the station, it turns out neither did she. But she was cool and found someone who worked there and asked him. He started to give her directions so I approached and explained they were for me, so he could just give me the directions. He refused, instead he forced me to wait ten minutes for another staff member to walk with me, despite me insisting multiple times that all I wanted were directions. It turned out the taxi point wasn't even 100 feet away. I was furious but the staff member totally dismissed me, saying he felt ""more comfortable"" if I was with someone. He would never feel like he had the right to impose like that on someone who isn't blind. Lots of people try and justify these actions, saying the person is just being nice or helpful. But the reality is they aren't because they don't value me in the same way they do another adult. And they assume that even though they don't know me, they know more about what I am capable of than I do."

"Well mostly my own poor decisions whether it was financial or being a responsible ""adult"". I can elaborate a bit more but it's a long story."
I agree if you are in fact a polar bear. 
Oh.
"Don’t give up, take what you learn and use it on the next project. 25 years of throwing shit at the wall eventually something will stick, i have worked many projects for free just for the chance of landing something big. Eventually it paid off for me."
Is it true that it's too cold for it to snow? Is this the coldest weather you have ever experienced?
I’ve got Donovan’s tune on my mind.
"In general, yes. I just don't bother with people, nor do I sleep with them. I have, and it's not particularly interesting to me."
Each comment = one bath 
Pfffft
No it’s cool I dealt with a lot of stuff in therapy. My long term boyfriend out of nowhere broke up with me &amp; i filled the time I used to spend with him connecting with old friends from school. They were into coke &amp; id done it a few times before but it just spiralled out of control. I moved onto opiates when I realised they took away the shitty jittery fieining I would get on the comedian. Realised I liked them more than coke and the rest was history lol 
Can you describe your social interactions before and after T?
