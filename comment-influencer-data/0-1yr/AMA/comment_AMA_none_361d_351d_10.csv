"A lot of it, I didn't realize was sociopathic at the time.  I was a kid, and I didn't know what was normal.  She shared WAY too much information with me from a young age, often graphic information used to scare me (rape, murder, etc).  She shared all the details of her dating life.  She made sure I knew that if I crossed her in any way, she'd come back at me ten times harder.  She constantly accused me of lying and punished me for it.   She ruined a lot of my relationships by convincing me my friends were on drugs, or talking behind my back, or bad people.  She accused me of being a lesbian and wouldn't allow my best friend to spend the night anymore.  All of it was about control, and it worked.  I was completely under her thumb and didn't know it.   "

"UPDATE: I left. Told him I was a little disappointed and that I had hoped that we would have talked more. To quote his response: ""I'm doing homework. I don't talk when I'm doing homework."" Now sitting in my dorm laughing with my friends about it.

Considering he is a redditor: Man, I'm sorry if you see this and it hurts your feelings, but this was SHIT. Homework or no homework, man, you gotta fuckin' talk to the person you're with."

Don't even trip. If that's how she is then you're better off without her. Especially considering your situation of dealing with a personal matter involving a health issue of a loved one. The last thing on your mind is your cell phone. 
"The fact that I'm *this* active on this thread during this uncomfortable mess should tell you how much he's paying attention to the photographs and/or math homework on his computer as opposed to the redditor sitting next to him..

It would be hilarious though."

"Of course I resent my mom, very much.  Not only for taking away time, and a relationship, with my dad, but also because she wasn't a great mom, and I could have had a much different life.  I loved her and still do, but in many ways she was abusive, and it's hard to look back on my childhood realizing I could have lived in a healthy environment.

My dad had always hoped that I would reach out to him.  It was weird.... I didn't have contact information for him, but I was able to get contact info for his wife, and when I emailed her, my intro was ""I don't know if you've heard about me...."" She later told me that she'd been hearing about me for 33 years, keeping a diary of all the presents they'd bought and sent (which my mom threw away), and all their therapy sessions in which my dad discussed whether or not to seek legal recourse to see me, etc.
At first, he was skeptical because he didn't know anything about me.  Was I contacting him because I wanted money?  A kidney?  But then it became obvious I was looking for the truth because I wasn't nice at all... just asking really hard questions.

Definitely thin crust."
Who does homework on a date?
"I had an abortion. My brief pregnancy was horrible, I would throw up all day. I'm grateful I found out early on. 

I have a three month old nephew now and I love him very much, but I've never wanted my own kids and never will. "
"I’ve seen people who have been rotting on their mattress for a little over a week, I’ve seen people who have died in a chair near a radiator and weren’t found for a week...

But the worst body I’ve ever seen was a man who hung himself to get back at his landlady. He was hanging from a rafter in the house for a week and a half. Thanks to gravity, his entire body was stretched in this demonic, Slender Man type of way.

When I went to get him in the body bag and cut the rope with my partner, all the fluid that had accumulated in his knee caps (thanks to gravity) had exploded all over me.

I later went home and genuinely was so disturbed it caused me to hallucinate. That image haunts me to this day."
What would you do if you have two 9's at blackjack? Split them stand them or hit them?

Hope you're doing fine.
"When my mom was alive, it never occurred to me to question my mom's version of things.  She had a pretty strong mental hold on me.  Later, I guess I wondered whether the abuse really happened, because I didn't have any concrete memory of it.  But for me, it was about risk analysis:  maybe this guy (a stranger) was okay, but why would I risk my safety and my family's safety over a ""maybe""?
After my mom died, and my grandmother soon after, I started having serious health problems and my doctor said I really needed to get my health history from my dad's side.  I sent him a letter saying ""I do NOT want a relationship, this is NOT an invitation, and I'm sorry to have to ask this, but... can you fill out this health history form?""   He did, but he also sent back a 7-page-typed letter.  It was a record of his meeting my mom, their courtship, early relationship, how she left him, etc.  At the time I got it, I was too emotional/freaked to read it.  Hands shaking, stomach upset.  I just put it in a file.
Four years later I was cleaning out files and I found the letter, and it was easier to read.  Apparently shortly after they got married, my mom accused my dad of being gay and didn't allow him to see his childhood best friend anymore.  (When I was in high school my mom accused me of being a lesbian and wouldn't let my best friend spend the night).   She accused him of cheating with men and women, and of being on drugs.   (I grew up hearing my mom accuse basically everyone of being ""gay,"" and she made me break off a few friendships because my friends might be on drugs).   When he cried because of her accusations, she said ""If you didn't do anything, why are you crying?""  (Said the same shit to me, and constantly accused me of things I didn't do).
The letter went on and on, and the similarities went on and on.  I realized maybe SHE was the problem?  I wasn't convinced, but I started asking questions.  Mostly my mom's sisters (older and younger).  Comparing their versions of events with hers, and putting everything together.
It was hard because my mom and grandmother were dead, and I wasn't talking to my dad about anything yet.  
But it quickly became clear that my mom's version of events (in terms of her removing me from the ""abusive situation"" and informing the family what was going on) did not line up with reality.
Like, 6 months after my mom moved me out of state, my aunt asked my mom if my dad was going to be seeing me, and my mom said ""No, mom and I took care of it.""  Meaning my mom and my grandmother handled it?  My aunt didn't find out there was abuse involved until much later when I told her.  And we're not a secretive family.  "
"My manic depressive ex stole my kids and has been doing similar.  Ive been trying to be in their lives for almost 4 years, but she makes lie after lie to keep them from me.  I feel your dads pain.  "
"Okay hi. Prepare yourself.

There are SO MANY small joys. First category would be the hedonistic ones - things just for me. I love driving. My route is long and takes me along some beautiful country roads. It's 30 minutes from my base to my first pickup, and it's just me and Martha (my bus). So much peace. 

Next would be the standard ones - blah blah blah, changing young lives, making a difference, being a reliable and useful member of society, kids are cute (no they are not.), stuff like that.

Finally, the important things. I'm what I call a Peripheral Adult. You know me, you see me every day, but you and I are not in any sort of relationship. This makes me a safe haven for a LOT of kids. And this is my favorite part. 

Kids show me their weird in a way they can't with parents and wouldn't with peers. I've had kids try out comedy routines (all terrible), ask me about boys or girls they like, tell me their terrifying dreams or their aspirations for their futures. 

One little girl, a twin, was telling me what she wanted to be for Halloween. She wanted to be Anna, and her sister was to be Elsa. At the school, her sister came up to me and shyly said ""I will be Elsa because that's what she wants. But I REALLY want to be an evil vampire, so I'm going to pretend in my head that I am.""

I've had kids choose me as their coming-out person, I know whose parents are getting divorced, I know who is moving and who is scared and who hates when their mom drinks. 

It's beautiful. This being trusted, this FAITH that they have in me just because I show up on time and tell them they're awful but I love them anyway. 

Edit: a space.
Thanks for listening."
"I'm really sorry that happened.  Keep reaching out to them (letters, gifts, whatever).  KEEP RECORDS.  Photocopies of the letters, receipts for the gifts, a diary of what you're going through.  All of that helped me understand my dad's side of the story and really believe him when I finally reached out to him.
Don't give up.  Your kids will grow up and the truth will come out. "

"I've been fortunate and haven't had many ""worst"" student incidents. Just your usual ration of fistfights, pot smoking and shenanigans. But some of the more memorable were the nerd who broke a bully's nose badly enough he needed plastic surgery with one punch (so proud of him!!!), the girl who proudly handed me her bottle of THC oil after I caught her dripping it because she was so stoned she thought I wouldn't mind, and the 5 year boy who announced he was going to murder his dad. 

Oh wait. One girl called her mom and said I was kidnapping them because I pulled over to wait for them to sit down. Which leads me to...

Worst parent experience - the woman who tried to climb in my window to ""snatch me bald and beat my ass."" But it was only worst on paper. Her face when she tried to extricate her hand from my firmly closed window was fairly priceless."

"Thanks stranger. The surgery went well when I got here so there was some room for me to go adventure and I ended up going to the countryside of Wakayama Prefecture. 

As it turns out, bus transportation is super limited, as well as connectivity. I was there on my 3rd day so it was impossible for me to call her. I ended up only texting everyday but that I guess wasn't enough"

"Smaller things that are all building up. He was late because he was ""watering his pet cacti"". Chose the one place in the entire coffee shop where we wouldn't be sitting facing each other (because the chairs were comfier apparently) so talking is nearly impossible. Not to mention he  isn't talking except about his photography (so much about his photography), his math homework, and he has yet to ask me a single question about myself."
"I hope he steps on all the legos. Oh, and if those other girls knew he had a girlfriend then I hope they develop burrito allergies."
"Me too. They both definitely knew about me. One of them continued to flirt with him till I left him. But shes such a miserable person, I bet she doesn't even like burritos. "
"I am very cabable of feeling love and joy for people first off, i have a girlfriend of 4 years whom i love alot, she often helps me in times where I dont understand how i should express myself

Socially it really only affects me in that sometimes people think of me as kind of an asshole since im incabable of ""feeling sorry for them"".

This is not to say i go around and talk shit and such because of it. I have lived with it for years, but didnt know what it was until about half a year ago. Since I have lived with it for so long, I have kinda learnt to fake feeling sorry (that sounds bad but its really my best option)

"We look practically identical!  
We both leave cabinet doors open when we're working in the kitchen or getting ready in the bathroom, making our respective spouses crazy.
We're both prone to depression and overanalysis.

We're introverts who like people.
We have trouble sleeping and have anxiety about it.

We both love action movies and 13-year-old humor.

"I once did a removal at a nursing home, and a woman in a wheelchair came across me and said “I’m going to be an angel soon!” and she seemed to be very excited. I continued on until I saw the white cross on one of the doors, indicating someone had just died.

I got the body I was there to receive (took about 10 minutes with paperwork) and started making my way back across the floor. But something was different. There was another white cross on a door that didn’t have one when I entered. “Did someone just die in the 10 minutes I was gone?” I thought to myself. My coworker who accompanied me was also confused.

We went down the hall and I noticed the room only had nurses in it, no family. So I entered to enquire about the situation.

The woman who had told me she was going to be an angel went straight to her bed and passed away.

It was and still is the most beautiful thing I have ever witnessed."

"I was sick in my bed (because I was pregnant) and on his laptop (he had left it). I was trying to email myself pictures on his computer of a recent trip we were on. I got nostalgic and looked back at our earlier photos, then came across a weird POV one of a girl, flirtatiously laying on a bed. I checked the date, and sure enough it was while I was in the psych ward. 

I called him and asked, what the fuck. And he confessed. Except, it was about another girl. I immediately started puking. Turns out, the night I went into the psych ward, he was sooo distressed that he fucked his model friend at a party at his house. He remained in contact with her ever since and denied any of my suspicions. The photo was of another girl he hooked up with while I was in the psych ward, just three days later. It was his coworker that I'd seen a few times. Two girls while I was hospitalized for a week. He never even visited once. "

I'm sorry.  Keep copies of the letters.  Keep a diary.  Keep records so you can show your son -- that's part of what helped convince me about my dad... seeing how much commitment he put in over the years. 
"Honestly, it wasn't. I'd been talking with them over the phone for almost a year and on the forum before filming, so we were pretty comfortable with each other. There was one interview that I didn't include in the film that was downright terrifying looking back, the guy said I deserved to be raped etc. At the time I was young and naive and it didn't hit me until way after that that was a scary situation."

"I actually decided in high school! I was asking my biology teacher why she never taught the death/dying stages as they were also a part of biology. She told me it was something I’d have to go to school for.

Later that week I started a coop program and when they told me they didn’t have any options for biology I said they may as well put me in a funeral home. They did, to my surprise, and the funeral Home said “you can do this, go to school for it!” so I did.

"Ya dude. Drop her and move on. Especially noting that you texted her daily so you were at least keeping her up to date. Plus not to mention the time difference,phone issues, connectivity. You communicate when you can and sometimes the elements and different time zones don't allow for that. If she's assuming you cheated then she's probably already carrying alot of emotional and personal baggage from a previous relationship that messed her up. I wouldn't go chasing after her, nor would I care to bring her back if she wanted back in but that's just me. if she's willing to break up with you over that then that's probably a headache you don't need to deal with to begin with. It's just the opening of a door to deeper underlying problems and red flags "

What motivates you?
"How do I describe this....hmmm

You have to be able to let yourself feel genuinely. You also have to know when to show it and when to channel it into actions that make a tangible difference in the world.

You also have to have the ability to read people’s body language and emotions. It helps a great deal in how you approach the person, which ultimately can be the deciding factor in making them feel a little better.

The sadness is very real. One time, last year, I went to a house call to remove a woman who died. Her husband was a nurse and cared for her up until her death at home, under the knowledge of and cooperation of the hospital. I’m supposed to be prompt in my removals, but he held me up at the door and talked to me for about 10 minutes about how much he loved her and how much he was going to miss her. He told me her favourite shows, and how she loved to knit, and how she made *the best damn ginger snaps you’ve ever had*. I stood there in my trench coat and suit, staring at him with the attention of a dog begging for food. Then he stopped and said, “and now I’m all alone. Life is beautiful but I’m 92 and I still don’t understand it.”

I left the house with his wife as he stood in the doorway and I got her into our transfer vehicle. Then I turned the corner and pulled into a grocery store parking lot and cried for 20 straight minutes. I’m crying right now typing this because it just killed me inside. But I had to let myself feel it because I went home and hugged everyone in my family and looked them dead in the eyes and told them how much I loved them.

Love is a powerful thing. It’s the only thing that beats sadness."
