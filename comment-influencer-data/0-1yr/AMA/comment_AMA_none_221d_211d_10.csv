"I suffer from all the above as well. What is your current med cocktail that works for you right now? 
Meds are also the only thing keeping me going. "
"Ok, two years, non violent, too young for serious white collar crime though....was it counterfeiting? "
"Yeah, not much to do though"
"Well, the film's never claim to accurately depict him, so I don't go into them expecting them to be anything more than some good media. Personally, I like them. The action is pretty good and Chris Hemsworth is amazing."
"You probably avoided talking to people because you didn't know if they were attackers. Terry on the other hand is none the wiser, he still has much to learn"
Hire me?
"Yeah I second this comment,
 Or to add like how do you attract guys/make it past 3 dates "
"Also another quick question, do like the TV show ""vikings?"""
Also my man every artist style of producing is different we all have our own techniques sound cartridges I do not use. But I am sure you write some really awesome material. I have not done it very long either I started getting into it as the 1st track I produced was categorized in the chip family so I have my own signature style and flow as I am sure you do as well. But to be recognized as a artist in a category is a great start. 
"When speaking strictly of the US, of I had time and money I definitely would. I mean, who wouldn't want to see as much of the world as they possibly could? Theres so much to experience!

It is worth mentioning though, I live in Texas by the way, that when I was younger, 12 or 13 yrs old, my family and I drove up to Canada (Edmonton, in Alberta) to visit my Grandmother. It was up and down as opposed to across, also I wasnt driving haha, but that's as close as I can claim üòÅ"
"How big was Bono in Ireland, and is does he have his place in Irish culture? What about the band U2?"
Both.
"I don't know a Jacob P, sorry."
"Does being ""considered black"" mean that you are culturally more close to black people? How does your interactions with white people go? "
Howie is exactly the way you think he'll be.  He's terrific with fans
"I focus more on Jesus and his message and what he did as apposed to the Bible as a whole. I still have a great amount of respect for the Bible, but yeah I suppose I‚Äôm a Christian spiritually."
Shrooms are better
No not really
"Wild berry is my favorite pop-tart, what‚Äôs yours?"
"Well, you should.  I'm in the US, too.  I've done it twice.  "
How do you feel about the marvel comics movies depicting Thor? Does it anger you or do you enjoy the films? 
"Awesome duo, I loved your act on AGT! How long have you been friends with Terry and how did your first meet?"
"Howard was not interested. Never heard from him again. Don‚Äôt even know if he liked us, or if it was scripted. 

I do have a normal job. 

I make about $50-$75 per video I upload. YouTube wants me to upload 3 videos a week. I didn‚Äôt so they slashed my views.  Could be good money, but I haven‚Äôt made a video in 4 months. I only do it when inspiration strikes, I don‚Äôt force it. "
"I will soon, maybe tomorrow, I'll do my best to keep it in mind and get it to you üòÅ cheers"
"You should check out the Pink Floyd laser light show at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry while on LSD sometime. When I went with my neighbors one time, we had an awesome time!
"
Are you king of the tards? 
Well tell him to save some pussy for the rest of us!
"Thank you, that means a lot. Though, even if I were to find a way to get us away from him now, it would not be advantageous for me and my mom. He's the provider, and she's disabled. Yes, you read that right, he has beat his disabled wife before. It's probably a big chunk of why she is disabled, that and my fucked up birth. But yeah, I'm taking her and I away from him when I turn 18 and can move out. My dad in the past few years seems to also have taken up the spicy water, Whiskey more specifically."
You could just teleport into bank vaults and steal money though. 
"I'm aware of the fact, but the prospect of anal masturbation just seems too personal to do in front of someone else, in my opinion at least"
"Which part of ""cus"" and ""lil"" makes you mature?"
Would you be interested in becoming gay?
"What DAWs? I've been producing for about a decade as well, I use FL Studio in Ableton, but mainly stick to FL Studio. I got a couple smaller synthesizers too, mininova mainly. The Roland you have is pretty good! I really want a Jupiter synthesizer myself.
It's very interesting you make chiptunes using a synthesizer, most producers who make chiptunes use a tracker because the program is laid out specifically for creating chiptune kind of instruments"
"Day goes by insanely fast. Figuring what stories to put in, where the reporters are gonna go, who's gonna read what story, what video we're gonna use... Makes the day whiz by. Which is good because I don't particularly like the job lol"
Do you call people autistic out of anger? 
"Why do you consider yourself the school slut? Surely there's worse, right? "
Ive had sexual interactions with a few animals
ehm not sure. probably not much to some of you - to some -&gt; opposite 
If I do not answer all your questions in depth as I don‚Äôt know everything there is to know about technical terms I just have fun being creative and writing music and playing around with as many sounds as possible tell it sounds right.  But most chip music is created with synthesizers. It‚Äôs a very classic arcade sound that when you play keyboard and understand software you can manipulate those sounds to be what ever formation you want I hope that makes sense I am trying to answer to the best of my knowledge. 
"So you just think people wake up one day and go ""ah, I think I want to be gay"""
True true
So just whatever he says is what's gonna happen? That's pretty hot actually. 
üëçüèª
"It's really just a lot of open and honest communication about how we feel and what we want. We talk before we do anything new, we have hard limits that aren't ever crossed, and we have a safe word in case anything ever gets out of hand. 

We also have kids, so it can't always be as full-time as we'd like. "
You didn't stockpile on szechuan sauce for that very moment? Shame on you!
"I don't care how much fat someone has, but a lot of fat indicates an unhealthy lifestyle. Early death that family members have to deal with. The public having to bare the burden of Medicaid and Medicare costs when major health problems set in (assuming you're in the US, if not, same question about the programs who pay your healthcare). How do you feel about all that? "
T-Series..... 
NO I KISS YOUR MOTHER WITH THAT MOUTH. HAHAHA .
Do you realize pretty much no one read that?
"Yes. They're not usually on the spot like right when I see them, but I'll get lost in my imagination playing out scenarios where I'll beat some guy up for saying something mean or just being an asshole to me or someone else. That's what I would say is the most prominent"
How many times have you tasted your own cum?
"What would you say are the biggest mistakes when people write? My native language is Spanish, and I would like to work as a translator in the future. I have an exam in a month to enter a translation course, and I would love some tips."
Medical science journals do a lot more for me than Google.
what‚Äôs the color of your toothbrush? 
Lol nah. I've done lemonade before. Not really an OJ guy. Plus I'm doing a light trip tonight. Just hanging out
what made you want to become a coroner?
I‚Äôve heard this. I don‚Äôt see the similarity. It is one of my favorite movies. 
"I would probably think the same thing if I just heard the phrase ""ocular albinism"" but it's natural looking. No one I've ever met can ever tell I have any condition or eye issues. My vision is still generally better than most people with the condition too since I can still drive and see everything.

As for the diagnosis idk if you could guess but ethnically I am indian so my parents kind of suspected something was off since I popped out looking Caucasian and more like the nurse who was delivering me's child. But my parents are still generally whiter than most indians so it wasnt that weird since they are pretty fair and I am just a little bit whiter. Usually with ocular albinism the eyes are only effected while hair &amp; skin still remain normal toned which is my case. 

When I was around 7 I started having issues seeing the boards in my classes from the back of the room. My eye doctor was easily able to detect the cause because ocular albinism is often associated with nystagumus and poor depth perception which I had. 

It is an extremely rare condition and even rarer for females to have it at all. For males it's like 1 in 60000 have a chance of having it.
"
I admit I have a bit of a crush on a much shyer person than I. Its really hard to tell if she likes me hahaha. 
I‚Äôm straight. But high and feeling curious lol
Uh at home lol
Why you rip off Napoleon Dynamite so hard?
At homer lol
Fair enough. Do you think the other people at the movie theater are going to notice?
"Im the opposite, im ready to work my ass off monday"
Which country?
"Thanks! I wasn‚Äôt nervous because it‚Äôs really hard to mess up, when your act is supposed to be bad. 

I will probably go back to the gong show season 3. Done with AGT for various reasons. "
"\*love

&amp;#x200B;"
"My favorite series even as an adult were Shivers, Goosebumps, and those old Christopher Pike books. It was just a style of writing I felt drawn to and loved. And it suited me. I like writing creepy/scary books but also love happy endings where the protagonist wins. "
Im really not trying to make an argument or troll you but seriously am interested in conversing with you. If drugs were viewed the same way back then as they are today wouldn‚Äôt alcohol be considered a drug as well and why was this drug ok to give to his people but not other substances? Also how does god differentiate a drug from a medicine? 
"Why would you lie about the age of your account when it's so easy to fact check?

&amp;#x200B;"
What are some ways that the dynamic extends? is it always in a sexual way?
"Fortunally It is a good thing we don't have technology like the movie minority report, you can't criminalize a crime that has not been committed. My point was that crime happens regardless if police is patrolling or not. Yes police presence will deter crime but not all crime. It is not possible for police to ' keep us safe' "
I‚Äôm interested in religion as a whole
"D:

"Hopefully just to sit down with them seperately and just tell them. If i'm too scared to, which i am, i'll just leave a note for them probably"
Dose anyone know about your situation besides your immediate family? 
r/subsithoughtwerefake 
Fair enough... lol keep up the laughter and good work. Sorry if I was a lil brash at first. 
Haven‚Äôt watched since I was on it. Kinda ruined the the whole idea. 
"Normal Life. Had some big opportunities that I‚Äôm either to lazy to do, or I didn‚Äôt want to relocate. 

I have shot a pilot for a major network. Done some behind the scenes work on several different shows, and wrote a few scripts that I could get produced if I chose. 

It did get me some really good connections in the business if I ever chose to use them. "
Married. 
"His humor has remained, or even somewhat heightened, now. He also stays up late and sleeps a ton, and everytime he wakes up he thinks he's in a house that they visit frequently in Kentucky (his house is in Indiana) ans confuses me for his brother who lives there. But I haven't really been around him often enough to know about anything else new. I hope you're okay after experiencing this as well. "
I‚Äôm open minded and will try most things once so was high enough to want to go for it.  Been in forever and haven‚Äôt cum still
"None off camera. The one judge I spoke to was Mel b. I said hi, she didn‚Äôt respond, rolled her eyes, walk d away. 

Howie did eat with the crew he seemed cool. "
"You should visit the giants causeway, not much to avoid really"
"This could mean 2 different things depending on gender. 

Female: middle school/high school spent slouching and waiting for boys to get taller. 

Male: don‚Äôt know, didn‚Äôt grow up as a 5‚Äô11‚Äù male. "
Means go big or go home essentially 
"That must have been my second operation. Before even beginning the operation, when we were still heading to our first forward base, we got under sniper fire. At that time is was still light enought for snipers to see. It was in the early evening. It was quite intense, but it was short due to it was just a T road we were crossing. After taking our second or maybe it was third house in the operation, we get under mortar fire, and there came some near hits, that I did not like the experience of. Especially because two of us, me and a kurdish heval were guarding the door alone, 3 floors down, while everybody else were upstairs planning how to take the next house (checkpoint) in our operation. When we were heading forward into ISIS held ground from the final house we took before we had to pull back, we got ambushed and some kurdish hevals got injured. Then we pulled back. Thinking that it was safe after w had walked a bit away from the frontline, guess what ... we get under sniper fire again. At that point we all had been up all night, and it have become morning again. It wasn't exactly the most exciding operation, and it failed. I heard a little bit after the operation had ended, that the two other groups that we were supposed to link up with on the operation, had taken some death casulties. I guess my unit and myself were lucky. 

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, during our second house or something like that, an explosion appeared out of nowhere, in a house right beside us. I could see the glimt. It must have been a mine that went off. Maybe an ISIS member walked into their own mine? I don't know. We all gave the window some rounds. "
Omg thats horrible. As the days go by the stints get easier to deal with. Sleep is normal also. The only thing is that the scabs inside the nose form so quickly its hard to pick them out. Kind of annoying.
Yeah you sound like you need a dog 
"What do Irish people think of Canadians? Or do they?

"Mines a bit of a weird and more... vigorous self discovery

When i was young i always wanted to be female characters from movies and TV shows. It gradually developed over time to dressing as a girl (first tried it a 9), looking at women and wanting to be like that, feelings of femininity and identifying more as a woman, then the growing disconnect with my body, trying makeup, more dresses, bras, wigs, feeling pretty and feminine. Erections were always really uncomfortable really and i treated my genitals quite badly. The first time i tried masturbating i cried afterwards, it was an incredibly disgusting awful experience for me that made me feel like a freak. I tried again in women's clothes to be sure it wasn't a weird kink, and yeah, in that moment i fully concluded that i'm a Transgender woman and my body definetly isn't right for me if it wasn't obvious enough from all the obvious indicators of disconnect with my birth assigned gender and body.

I identify as Bisexual (despite what i said i'm comfortable with the male body as long as i'm not in it haha)"
Pretty normal
"On AGT, are the winners cherry picked ahead of time because the studio has a list of clients looking for certain talent they can get a cut of the rights to? That's always been my theory, anyway. "
"No Simon when I was there. Howard, howie, Heidi, and Mel b. Howard was pretty cool. "
No worries. I just saw about 20 comments with zero replies yet. I‚Äôve received my downvotes for mentioning it. 
"I did, finished on wednesday if i remember right"
"Practice makes perfect, my friend. Enjoy!"
"Do you have anyone to talk to?

Question | Answer | Link
---------|----------|----------|
Do you have unwarranted mean thoughts about strangers?|Yes. They're not usually on the spot like right when I see them, but I'll get lost in my imagination playing out scenarios where I'll beat some guy up for saying something mean or just being an asshole to me or someone else. That's what I would say is the most prominent|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/am9cuf/im_just_some_random_dude_but_if_you_want_you_can/efkbt2u/)
Opinion on using a bidet?|I've never used one, but I imagine that its pretty refreshing!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/am9cuf/im_just_some_random_dude_but_if_you_want_you_can/efkd05s/)
Have you ever gotten poop on your penis from anal?|I'm a dude, a technically ""mostly"" straight dude; I'm not gay but sometimes I just dont give a fuck and when one of my gay friends starts flirting and wants to get down and dirty I'll just be like ""What the hell, why the fuck not"" and while I've tried to take dick (there is no greater pain, especially when you have an anxious asshole that refuses to relax) I have given dick and while it definitely smelled like fuckin poop (the worst part of gay male sex: the smell (i'ts not that bad though tbh just kinda like ""dang"")) I actually have not pulled my dick out AMD found poop on it. Remarkably clean, Anthony Sullivan would be impressed  Thank you for the question|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/am9cuf/im_just_some_random_dude_but_if_you_want_you_can/efkbe1f/)
Ever tried sucking your own dick?|I have actually, but to no avail. Maybe if I started doing yoga though  Thank you for the question üòÅ|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/am9cuf/im_just_some_random_dude_but_if_you_want_you_can/efkbj3z/)
How many times have you tasted your own cum?|A handful of times. There's always that one time when your 12 or 13 and you're curious, for everybody I think. Intentionally though, maybe like three or four times.  I remember one time I was jacking off when I was 15 yrs old, i was laying on my back on my bedroom floor, and right when I was about to climax I threw my legs up in the air so that I went upside down, balancing on my shoulders, my cock right above my face and I just straight up jizzed all over my face. And because of the sheer excitement of the situation I actually had a SECOND climax 3 or 4 seconds after the first l. However weird that was, that's the only time, even to this day seven years later, that I've climaxed twice in a row  And then there's other times when yanking it while laying on my back in bed that the trajectory speed and velocity was greater than expected and it just happened to get on my lips, neck, armpit, where ever really  Thank you for the interesting question!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/am9cuf/im_just_some_random_dude_but_if_you_want_you_can/efkc7z8/)
Have you ever owned a sports car?|I owned a car a couple years ago (2016-17)that was definitely sporty looking, but technically was not a sports car. What I speak of was a 2003 Hyuandai Tiburon GT, but I didnt take good enough car of it and the radiator blew a hole in itself (I've learned my leason). I sold it to my friend for 300 USD or soemthing like that|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/am9cuf/im_just_some_random_dude_but_if_you_want_you_can/efkdzdq/)
Have you ever driven across your country?|I live in the U.S. so that would be extraordinarily time-consuming haha üòÑas cool as it would me to see more of the U.S. though, if I were able to stay in say Europe under more than ideal financial conditions I would visit every place that I could since there's so much to see, cultures, people, and scenery, and all so relatively close together and learn as much as I could üò™ Thank you for the question Mister Bill!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/am9cuf/im_just_some_random_dude_but_if_you_want_you_can/efke4qa/)
What makes your blood boil?  To the point it might, under the right circumstances, incite you to violence?|Ignorant and arrogant people who refuse to even consider or think about other possibilities that are opposed or different to whatever their beliefs are, and it could pertain to anything: religious beliefs, superstitions, opinions on any drug whether beneficial to body and mind or simply harmlessly recreational. People who refuse to listen to straight up logic get me seething to some degree but what gets to me most is radicals and extremists, and this ties in with my aforementioned pet peeve, just to a greater level. What made me mad that I mentikmws last time but worse, such as radical feminists or any  other activists pushing for movement of their group through unethically sound or devoid of sense (not even common sense (that's how low they've gone in my eyes(just my opinion, nobody take it to some galactic level please))), any far veering political party, and so on (you get the gist)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/am9cuf/im_just_some_random_dude_but_if_you_want_you_can/efkebcw/)
Have you ever inserted a foreign object into any of your orifices?|Yes, I am able to shove my pinky up my nose as far as the second knuckle ( a pinky isnt foreign now that I think about it but whatever) but also the same with my pinky and my going g behind my eyeball, just not quite as far A nd I've shoved a squash using petroleum jelly up my ass to try and activate my prostate (unsuccessfully I might add, I need to do more research to reach the locate it and commence the #ultimatepleasure?)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/am9cuf/im_just_some_random_dude_but_if_you_want_you_can/efkgkxc/)
How do I get into a relationship? Should I try to pursue one or let someone come to me? Not feeling desperate, but just wondering|Well just going off of my personal experiences of:  - ""failures"" * *( using 'failure' for lack of a better word, I dont mean it to sound so harsh)* *  - seeming successes that either ended up in failure or even mutual understandings that we simply were just pretty much bored and over the whole thing  - Asking someine out and dating, and then a week or two on she says she doesn't think its working out or something along those lines   It's my theory *(existing theory I guess, that I'm elaborating upon and adding to)* that all these scenarios can be avoided by simply being yourself  ""Yo wtf! We've all heard this a hundred times!"" You may be thinking  But what I want to say which probably hasn't been said very often before about that is just hang out around them. Make yourself at least somewhat familiar to them so that they have a chance to create their own impression of you I suppose  Dont focus all your attention on them alone, if you're part of the circle interact with the whole circle accordingly. Dont, at first at least, hit on them or flirt and shit. Let them see who you are. Then they'll like you for who you are if they do happen to be interested, but this doesn't even have to be with your crush, it could be with literally anyone you already happen to interact with on a daily basis, you may not be their crush but who knows what may come of it if you just take the leap. Familiarity is the first step in my theory  This is all just my speculation and what I think I've figured out so dont take it for fact of how the Universe works or nothing lol But I'm tired of typing haha, if there was any specific thing that reached out to you that you would like me to elaborate on though I would be happy too üòä|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/am9cuf/im_just_some_random_dude_but_if_you_want_you_can/efkhy4e/)
What do you think is the most interesting conspiracy theory?|I'm a bit of a conspiracy nut so I already have an opinion, but just to sum it up I'd say the hold the government and other higher powers have over us, anything that we've been thought is what we've been allowed to learn. That pretty much covers everything üòÖ|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/am9cuf/im_just_some_random_dude_but_if_you_want_you_can/efkii1v/)
What is the best kind of vegetable?|Maybe spaghetti squash? I haven't had it in over a decade but the way my mom made all those years ago has made quite the impression lol. That possibility aside, I have lots: spinach, broccoli, potatoes, (tomatoes depending since they're technically a fruit), squash, zucchini, watercress and many other garden variety veggies*bud-um tsss*  All time favorite is probably asparagus though|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/am9cuf/im_just_some_random_dude_but_if_you_want_you_can/efkiwzr/)

"Being a friend, you mean? It depends. If they don‚Äôt creep me out, then we stay friends after. 

I have some ex-clients that are now my friends and some that aren‚Äôt my friends but I check up on them and talk to them every now and then. Especially those clients that paid to be me to be their friend/girlfriend during a dark time in their life.

What mostly happens when they stop paying/talking to me is when they find a friend/girlfriend in real life who they don‚Äôt need to pay because I usually help them find the confidence to talk to other people and be more open to their friends in real life or find other people who they can be their true self.

So they become busy in real life and stop talking to me."
Is it true about what the internet speaks of ‚ÄúAlabama‚Äù?
How painful was the salt and what type of salt was used?
i don‚Äôt particularly know what defines as serious issues. 
Satanism is pretty against things like worship and being afraid to mess up so i can guarantee that no satanist finds it offensive to not capitalize it 
So ignore the next step if the step before was positive?
"I always thought its the guy from the bible.

So why that name ""satan""?

Will you ever do rule 4 &amp; 10?"
I smell a bit of FBI
I don't! 
"It began in 1948-ish when Israel became a nation, and continues to today. Both parties want control of Jerusalem and they want security. There have been many attempts to ratify a two state solution plan. 

Further than that, I would start telling my opinion, which would result in the subtraction of fake internet points from my post. 

"
Thanks. 7 years. 
Do you believe in the God from the bible?
"Tbh its kinda like I have a hard time saying ""no"" and that's just how I am in any situation, sexual or not, workplace or home, friends and family, I like up do what I can for anybody, that's just my mindset. Im a people pleaser, no pun intended

Not that i'm submissive or let myself be manipulated or abused or some shit (just to get that out of the way)

I just go with the flow. I've turned down as many gay advances as I've accepted, if not more. It really just depends on my mood at the time and whether or not I feel like going through all that stuff (which 90% of the time is just oral, i'm not all that about butt stuff)"
How does it feel?

I know it‚Äôs confusing but we don‚Äôt really believe in a physical satan or hell or even heaven we think it‚Äôs possible that there‚Äôs an after life but we don‚Äôt know what is is nor do most of us care the reason we‚Äôre called satanist is because the Latin word for opposition is satan 
"well firstly, you‚Äôre gonna be okay. you‚Äôre gonna see some really weird shit but just don‚Äôt try to hold on to yourself for the time being, stay safe, and enjoy the trip."
Ok no worries. I'm around 15-19 and am about to take shrooms what advice do you have.
no i don‚Äôt believe so 
Amazing! What a rush- what was it like to be up there and feel the love from the audience?  
oh shit you‚Äôre pretty experienced lol.
"You fool. I backtraced your account info and found your IP address. I have your name, residence, etc. All of New York is about to reign down  on your operation. Tough luck"
"Do you think shes a pedo/into shottas?

Are you going to marry her?

Do you cheat on her?

Do you love her?

Where did you meet her?

Do your parents know?

Do you think this relatio ship will last forever?

Is she sexual active? 

How often do you guys get into an argument?

Yeah that happens a good bit. No one in my family but I had a couple of friends in school who had parents that were cousins. It‚Äôs more of relations than relationships. The communities in my surrounding area are so small and so far apart that the dating pool is tiny. It‚Äôs totally disgusting and mostly the poor lower class (that I‚Äôve noticed anyways). 
"Kudos to you for being able to stop yourself. I know how much it sucks to be in a country where majority of the people don‚Äôt really understand how important mental health is. 

You were able to control yourself when you were weak and now you‚Äôre stronger than you were. Stay strong, man."

Music is a great idea! Good luck with the rest of your evening! 
I really can‚Äôt stand how they make Christians as a whole look bad. Kinda like how Myanmar make Buddhists look bad or how ISIS makes Muslims look bad
Did he seem like the guy that would be capable of such heinous acts?
Reach out to me if you ever need to talk. Or if you need me to help find local resources for you. I‚Äôm sorry. I came from a verbally abusive alcoholic father. He was never physically abusive toward me but he was at times toward my mother. It was hard. I couldn‚Äôt wait to turn 18 and move out. 
"not really. i developed depression before my bipolar disorder. for a long time, however, bipolar disorder was diagnosed as ""manic depression,"" so that could be where you're confused. bipolar disorder can lead to depression, but not always."
I've never seen you before. This is the best thing I've seen all week. I'm still laughing. You guys tapped into something but I don't know what that is.
"As a matter of fact, I do! Typically I just call police in an effort to fight human trafficking. However, I did lose my temper on one once and gave some very specific threats regarding which dumpster she would be found in, and exactly how many pieces they would find, if she knocked on my door again. (She knocked 4 times in 20 minutes at 3ish AM.....)"
Lot lizards. Got any experience?

"Oh, my bad. Headphones was a good idea though. Just watch a movie or something, it'll keep your mind off of that. "
I don‚Äôt agree with them for the most part so I just kinda ignore them. They can be funny sometimes in the ‚Äúeveryone‚Äôs getting angry‚Äù kinda way
"Yes, he is a ladies man actually. He‚Äôs single. But he has had plenty of relationship opportunities!"
Thanks. New stuff is coming from Dustins dojo and life of Greg on the YouTube channel. 
"any big differences between you two? Like what stands out, age wise"
"Thank you for taking the time to write all of this out, and showing me some perspective. I came to my family and talked with them, along with some close friends aswell. I will keep going, its the journey that makes the man."
"It's 1 am in my country, but thank you dear redditor, likewise. "
Were you mad that only two judges understood how freaking hilarious that was? 
Around 10 minutes I think. After that I heared them talking again. Not sure though cuz I closed the door and started playing music after 10 seconds.

"What was your act for the Gong Show?  I'm assuming that your partner there is also ""Terry""."
"Have you received any backlash because of it? I always imagine that if the killer dies before justice is reached, that the next of kin start getting attacked instead. "
I will check it out. thank you
Dude I loved that act! So funny.

Some people would rather feel good for a short while than make the right choices. 
Ty for tips!  Like a wand with a large and angled head. Vibrates a bit. Just couldn‚Äôt get the O despite feeling so great. I‚Äôll go till I do lol
A bit late. Also I gave him 6 months of no-contact and he really did seem like he needed the problems spelled out. I think he mighr have finnaly figured it out and for the spell broken today
Thank you! 
We try to be! 
"Which one did you get?  

Basic process:

Use the bathroom first. Not trying to be graphic, but both ends. In the gay community it's jokingly referred to as ""gunning it out"". A lot of guys use a shower wand, fill up, use the toilet.  Rinse repeat until clean. Then make sure you have peed.  The sensation of a prostate orgasm is very similar to having to pee. Also, if you haven't peed before, some will come out when trying to get a prostate orgasm. 

Everyone is a little different, and toys are different shapes. One that is a but of a horseshoe shape works best for me. If the massager has a pulsate setting, I would not use that.  Just a straight steady vibration is best.  Insert it and find the spot. If you are already hard it's easy to know when you found it.  If you put pressure on it with the toy, usually a bit of semen will come out. (Of your cock; probably don't need to point that out, but.....). Anyway, that's the prostate. Keep pressure on it with the toy, maybe a little side to side motion, but don't let off. It can take up to 5 or 10 minutes some times. When you get that feeling like you are going to pee, you are close.  It's usually a lot of liquid, almost like urine but a bit thicket and slimier. Have a towel handy. "
Thank you so much!
"No dont have the lunch.  You're done with him, it's been made clear and he needs time to figure it out. "

Didn‚Äôt Moses lead the Israelites to freedom? I don‚Äôt care about the other ‚Äúpro‚Äù slavery passages. There‚Äôs a whole book about freeing Slaves
Not painful.... it was baby powder. 
"Maybe spaghetti squash? I haven't had it in over a decade but the way my mom made all those years ago has made quite the impression lol. That possibility aside, I have lots: spinach, broccoli, potatoes, (tomatoes depending since they're technically a fruit), squash, zucchini, watercress and many other garden variety veggies*bud-um tsss*

All time favorite is probably asparagus though"
This is definitely you Jacob. You moved there from CT.
"Thank you for your support :)   


I am happy to hear that they were spared the fire's wrath. "
"Perhaps it does. But hell is not a place of fire and brimstone, it is a place of dishonor. Basically imagine Hitler having to clean the toilets at a Jewish deli"
Yes I want to know these reasons too.

What do you know about this history of Israel and Palestine?  
"Essentially nothing really. Should I have declined my bid to join nothing would have happened, I would of been aware of what was going on clearly, but would just not be involved of course.  But often untrustworthy members would be barred from any involvement. "
Who said they were?
"I have not! Though that'd be one hell of a way to propose, to be honest. 

My press story is funny: I've collected broadsides for ages--there's a Robert Bly one about ten feet from my head at the moment--and I've always wanted to make one on an actual press. Well, MN is home to the Minnesota Center for the Book Arts, home to Chandler &amp; Price presses, Vandercooks, you name it, not to mention a type library that's just incredible.   


A couple of Christmases ago, I told my wife (for about the 43rd time) that I really want to take a letterpress class. She said, ""DO IT"" and before I could hesitate, I signed up. It was wonderful, and I made my first prints, including a poem, and I was hooked. I immediately wanted a press, but they're, uh, expensive. I looked and I looked, and lo and behold, a couple over in Wisconsin (about five hours east) had one, a Pilot. I countered (by a lot) on their offer, promising cash, that day, and they agreed. I called into work and told them, I AM DRIVING TO WISCONSIN TO BUY A PRINTING PRESS, and they understood. (Plus, it was a Friday and I had a vacation day.) I drove 10 hours or so, loaded it up with the seller's help, and then managed to set it up in my basement by sliding it down the stairs on my ice-fishing sled. (WELCOME TO MINNESOTA.) It worked, and the press worked just fine, and now after a few instances of being ""out of sorts"" I've been setting a small broadside. It's slow-going, but damn it's satisfying.   


I'm calling the press HAYMAKER PRESS, though it remains to be seen how productive I am with it."
Weaponized Autism?
Why would you do such a thing?
I never blamed the world for my sadness lol
Not my kind of Satanism.
"That was My first big appearance. After doing others shows on screen and off screen it kind of makes you feel exploited. Other shoes treat the talent really well. Gong show treated us 100x better. 

The crew at Agt was nice, but once they they get what they need, they‚Äôre done with you, but expect to to keep working for them. Flights were booked last minute. Scheduling was last minute. All shooting plans were last minute. Sometimes you would sit in a room for 6-8 hours with no purpose and they wouldn‚Äôt let you leave.  Could go on but won‚Äôt. 

Gong show crew was truly welcoming and friendly. They still keep in touch. "
That's fucking nuts
I can imagine. Lots of good thoughts headed your way! 
"you can get involved but it is incredibly tough, merely because of the fact that everything is based upon trust and who you know. There are hundreds of different roles that are assigned to really anyone, often non Russian members of the family itself. However, main members are based upon family members and those incredibly close to the family. Essentially, if you meet the right people and attain honor, eventually you may get to join the *family*."
