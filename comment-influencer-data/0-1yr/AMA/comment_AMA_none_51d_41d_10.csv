"middle seat on an airplane, on a tuesday, sitting next to the former prime minister of lithuania"
"Step 1... Find air marshal
Step 2... Act like a terrorist
Step 3... Get them to kill me.

The middle seat makes it so much more difficult. 

Step 1. Jump up, face the pm (do not put butt near) and run to the back of the plan. 
Step 2. Throw underwear into the toilet and flush. 
Step 3. If pants are also soiled, hang out in the toilet until the flight lands. If pants unsoiled, compose myself and locate the nearest attendant and explain that I had an accident and would like to change seats to the back as I am not feeling well. Hopefully they can oblige. 
Step 4. Consider acting sick enough to get them to land the plane."
"Nope. After you’ve seen what the plants go through, you could never allow tobacco smoke to enter your body."
This year we are actually piloting a small hemp crop. Very experimental in nature
"Dirt, the ground, chemicals, old,dusty, dirty barns. They are not treated like something a person is going to put near their mouth, and that’s the norm as far as my knowledge extends"
"I started farming before I knew what it truly was and went for, and it goes to cigar wrappers. There is always the small bit of regret, but the passion for the successful growth/process of farming far outweighs that. After all, have to make a living"
"1. Shift my hips forward as much as possible to take pressure off of the load. 

2. Try to remain calm and act as if nothing happened while attempting to remember the closest bathroom to recover in. 

3. Following the completion of the ride. Scurry to the bathroom, to assess the damages. If it has gotten through to my pants, pull out extra set of pants in my bag. While in the stall, use toilet paper to wipe out as much poo as possible from the underwear. Throw underwear in trash after cleaned. 

4. Free ball in new or old pants. Leave as quickly as possible to home"
Do you not feel so good because you're squished or are you sick?
"I don't ever poop myself. I get really fucking close.  Once I was at work realized I needed to poop, got up and started to hurry my way to the restroom. Halfway there I had to just stand straight up and clench as tight as possible without moving. Had I loved it would've flowed out of me. Since then I always have a plan."
Are you a smoker?
You're on a date with the person who may be the love of your life. Your boss and your parents show up and ask to join your table. You try to say no but your date insists that they join. You are pinned on the inside of one of those round booths with two people on either side of you. Someone is sitting in a chair at the head of the table. You fluff once and it's wet. You feel a mass of white hot sludge filling your colon. Your twitching sphincter is the only thing holding in a quart and a half of sour water with gelatinous chunks. The waiter shows up and begins to take orders. Everyone has questions and complicated instructions. The waiter painstakingly writes everything down. Now you learn that the waiter and your mom went to high school together and they are holding a long conversation. The wavelength of your sphincter spasms is shifting rapidly. What do you do?
To be fair he didn't say he lived through every one of these plans
"Jesus Christ lol.

Step 1. I am fairly confident that the fluff and splash can be smelled by everyone at the table. Tell the table that you have had a rough case of food poisoning and thought you were over it. Apologize, and excuse myself from the booth.

Step 2. ~~Don't come back, quit my job, emancipate from my family, take enough anti-depressants until I forget how to love.~~ Go to the restroom and clean myself up, hopefully none got through to my fancy pants or socks. Wipe thoroughly. Try to take a nice poo. 

Step 3. When I return to the booth, request a chair to sit on in an effort to strengthen the food poisoning excuse. Call the waiter over and cancel the food order as you are not feeling well. Switch to water from whatever you are drinking. 

Step 4. Try to enjoy the night, but be sure to make regular trips to the restroom. Hopefully someone will inform you that you look very sick and that the dinner should come to an early end."
"Oof. That would be horrible. 

1. Hope for the following: there is enough water in the raft to semi conceal the stench, the rapids are strong enough to take any attention off of what is going on inside the raft. 

2. Depending on how long we have, stand up more than I had been, maybe a low squat or something similar. Don't want the poo squished. 

3. Once we get to the end, jump into the water immediately. Slide pants down and wipe out with hands and clean them off all under water. 

4. Probably smells awful, but it is likely that I have an extra set of pants because who wants to white water raft in the same thing you're driving home in. 

5. Throw pants away, wash hands thoroughly, act as if nothing happened."
"Stuck on a rollercoaster during a heavy rainstorm, go!"
That's because I haven't walked into the room baby
"I’m excited to see your interest and am happy to share as much as I feel comfortable anonymously on the internet! 

1. Currently, as our main crop is smaller and has shifted to feed corn, the extent of our airborne use is by drones for security concerns. The terrain is not optimal for air spraying due to tons of random trees. 

2. As we have been a small family only outfit since inception, the majority of our current tobacco-specific equipment was made in the early 1940s and has held strong. As it is such a delicate crop, precision is of great importance, and comes at creat financial costs. 

3. Absolutely not opposed to cannabis (thc) but first we have to get through the hurdle of what this hemp may bring!

4. As we have stores of seed and snub flowers at growth, bees generally have little direct impact on our specific crop. 

5. We work very closely with a group of scientists when we have extremely specific questions such as this, but generally, a dark green color, uniform leaf proportions and distribution, growth rate, and (by rule of thumb) appropriate look of a plant by memory judge a healthy plant. 

6. My family owns and runs every aspect of our harvest, with about 300 owned acres of crop and 200 rented from local farmers too old to tend fields themself. The closest we deal with ‘mega corps’ are the massive landscaping companies we sell our turf to. 

7. Vandalism due to trespassing is the largest problem. Luckily, due to natural terrain barriers, we have few neighbors and little to no disturbances otherwise. 

8. Due to the longevity and compact scale of the farm, we have remained extremely wholesome, and have assisted in pioneering the future of farming in the area. My grandfather taught me to be honest and just, and with our local legacy, no one much bothers us."
A little of column A a little of column B
Would you grow weed/hemp instead if it became legal?
"I actually joined a medically supervised weight-loss program. Most of what I do for myself is actually about appetite control and regular eating times, though diet and exercise are definitely a vital factor as well.  


**Please note that everything I talk about is from my incomplete understanding of how this all works. I'm not a doctor, or a weight loss specialist, but this is my understanding of how things go with regards to weight loss.**  


So the real key to it all is knowing what the requirements are for your body to stay in a fat-burning state rather than a fat-storing state. There are a number of requirements that are needed to maintain this, and frankly, I struggle with being good about it all the time. But here they are:  


* You must consume enough calories to meet your basal metabolic rate. Your basal metabolic rate is the minimum number of calories your body needs to burn in order to keep the bare-minimum functions of your body alive. If you eat less than your basal metabolic rate, regardless of anything else, your body goes into a starvation mode and stores as many calories as possible. If you stack exercise on top of this, it actually makes the inherent starvation response even stronger, which is actually why exercising on a starvation mode could make weight gain even worse.
* You must eat at routine times. Another thing about the body is that if your body has no idea when the next meal is coming, then it also tends to store as much as possible. I eat about 6 light meals throughout the day at 2-3 hour intervals to retrain my body into expecting food at the right times. The other important thing is that when you have a regular meal schedule, it can actually help align your sleep schedule. Which brings me to my next point.
* You need to get enough sleep. If your body doesn't sleep well, and sleep at a regular time, it can throw a lot of your body's equilibrium stuff out of whack. If you don't rest right, you can't exercise right if you choose to do so. If you're excessively tired, you can't control your eating routine times and self-discipline as well and then shit goes off. You might choose to take a quick nap instead of eating the meals needed to regulate your meal-schedule. It can cause a cascade of shit not going well and make everything fall apart. It's a bitch to get it all together. 
* You have to limit your carbs and sugars. The body naturally burns carbs and sugars before it burns fat. So if you don't have any carbs and sugar to burn, the fat is the natural fuel source to go to. But if you end up in starvation mode, your body will actually use it's muscle mass first before fat, as fat is the emergency storage and muscles are more nutrient dense than fat. So it's important that you keep the first three bullet points in mind.

&amp;#x200B;

So much of what I do is about self-regulating meal times and the like. Hope that helps answer things!"
"It wasn't a single moment, and more of a gradual understanding over several years. I think perhaps the first time something changed within me was when I made a racist comment in front of a woman I enjoyed being around and she reacted *extremely* poorly to it (and rightfully so). The shame I felt resonated within me. If your personal beliefs make you feel shameful or guilty, they aren't good beliefs and you know it."
What exactly have you done? I’m assuming “diet and exercise” but what specifically?
Well now you have to expand- what do the plants go through?
"Knowing this, and that you’re selling to addicts, is there any internal conflict in doing our work?"
"Currently, planting is finished, so it’s getting equipment ready for harvest, therefore we’re looking at 8-5 every day besides Sunday. During the planting and harvest, it’s closer to 6-6 to ensure everything goes smoothly. I have to add tobacco is not our only crop right now, and some of that time is dedicated to corn, turf, pumpkins, etc"
"Just roll with it and accept it.  Oh, stand sideways to the door and give the pushers a nice elbow to keep them from squashing up into your junk.  Holding a wet umbrella also keeps people away from you."
Next situation. White water rafting with your fiancée and future in laws.
"Oh man..

Step 1. Announce that I have Crohn's disease and what comes with it is uncontrollable diarrhea. (I don't actually have Crohn's)
Step 2. Force them to turn around while I try to clean myself up. 
Step 3. Pick up the phone in the elevator and talk to the fire department and explain that there is a biohazard in the lift and resolution of the situation needs to be expedited.
Step 4... Hope people don't vomit."
No. But a girl collapsed in front of me yesterday. I think it was an epileptic seizure.
"In our current culture climate, it is good to read about a person who was a former self proclaimed white nationalist and now is committed to working to eradicate racism. Good for you, with all respect to your journey, I wish you well in all your endeavors. We are all immigrants from somewhere else, that is how America was built."
I feel like this is a really well worded description of what anyone would do if they accidently shit on a rollercoaster.
"Throw yourself into the rapids, lose pants under the water, and show the inlaws what your fiance will be working with."
Hah I'm imagining someone with a wet umbrella when it hasn't rained in weeks
"I appreciate that. There really isn't anything special about my plans, I simply have hundreds of them. The more complicated they are, the more difficult they become to execute."
"Depends on what you mean, if it's from butt play, then I would apologize and ask for something to clean myself with. 

If my bowels decide it is time for a surprise appearance, I would do the following.

Step 1. Poo. 

Step 2. Immediately force myself to start crying in an effort to make my face flushed and eyes puffy. 

Step 3. Tell the person that I have IBS and that I didn't have a chance to take my anti-anxiety medicine. 

Step 4. Rush to get cleaning supplies. 

Step 5. Following the clean up, offer to purchase the person a new bed. 

Step 6. Probably have to buy the person a new bed, make some silly joke about the situation and part ways for life. 

Step 7. Try not to do it again."
How often do you poop your pants?
"Okay, I'm starting to get interested in this AMA:

1. What kind of airborne tech do you use? Drones? Agwagons or other spray planes?
2. Do you use any robotic tech like fully automatic harvesters?
3. Any interest in dipping into the Cannabis growing industry as prohibition ends in the US? Do you have the land and climate for it? I saw you're looking at hemp - how about Cannabis Sativa? Would CT allow you to experiment with it?
4. I am not an outdoorsman - do bees affect tobacco, and has the variance in bee prevalence cascaded through the growth chain enough to affect tobacco?
5. How do you know if a tobacco plant is healthy, other than condition of the soil and eyeballing it. Do you feel it, taste it, conduct tests, centrifuge leaves, etc?
6. Are you a megacorp or an honest to God family-owned-farm owner? Does the megacorp own the land and you do the farming? 
7. What crimes are you subject to? Vandalism? Theft? Other? What's the proximity of the backwoods meth industry to your land or business?
8. How much corruption is there? Do you engage in bribery, pay protection, spy, etc in order to be successful? I mean this respectfully, and you can ignore the question if it offends. I'm interested, not judging."
"Great, great grandfather came from Lithuania to grow potatoes. Family kept growing in our area and since I could walk I’ve been around plants and tractors!"
"That means either the rest of the applicants were shit, or the job is gonna suck ass."
"You missed a step, take a viagra while in the water."
Yes but it's a very very rare sight and only on certain lines.
"This one made me laugh pretty hard. My best friend deals with IBS as well.  He and I have talked through many situations. I think if I pooped myself right before the beginning of the service, there are two options: 1. The responsible thing to do. 2. The easy way out.

&amp;#x200B;

1.Try to find someone else to officiate. Following locating someone to fill my role... 

Step 1. Go to the nearest restroom and clean up.

Step 2. Find a large trash can, throw as much of the clothing away as necessary. It frankly isn't worth trying to clean poop out of a white linen suit. It doesn't really want to come out of anything. 

Step 3. Depending on how far from civilization we are, I'd call someone to bring me pants and underwear. 

Step 4. Apologize profusely to my best friend. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. Immediately faint.

Step 1. Collapse over and start having a mock seizure. I actually have epilepsy, so selling would be semi easy. 

Step 2. Push a little harder and maybe pee myself. 

Step 3. ""Come to"" and ask to go to the hospital. 

Step 4. Build a huge amount of debt to avoid admitting I pooped myself in a nice white linen suit."
"Yes but if you can't stand the heat, stay out of Kabukicho as they say"
I'm travelling to Tokyo next May for my honeymoon and the thought of your exact situation makes me incredibly anxious. Any tips?
Take Viagra before the trip. Establish dominance regardless of pantshitting.
"Well, I know now that there is no proven correlation between IQ and race and that regional factors can have a great impact on results regardless. But back then, when I thought that race and intelligence were linked, no one discussed East Asians. It was only ever a topic brought up to dehumanize black or brown people, because that's what fit the narrative."
I salute you and your ability to come up with a contingency plan!
Far from it.
well that took a turn for the worst
Thanks for the response. How many hours do you put in on an average week? Does your schedule change based on the season?
Stuck in a lift with 6 more people for an hour. Your move.
Surprisingly honest and elegant. I would have liked to see you better address the likelihood of uncontrollable release due to the oscillating b-hole - including maybe some kind of risk mitigation strategy. But - I accept. 8/10.
"\&gt; Be me, 4th grade. Ropes summer camp.

\&gt; Go on high rope, 2nd person up. Terrified of heights.

\&gt; Ate some spicy breakfast tacos before starting the day. 

\&gt; Get to the top. Feel stomach roar. Person in front is frozen in the middle. Person behind is closing in. 

\&gt; Sweat starts pouring down face, back and crack. 

\&gt; Water hits hole and my sphincter tightens to a new level, but realize it cannot withstand the advancing infantry. 

\&gt; Let out a mighty scream that I need to go to the restroom right now and that I cannot make it down before I go. 

\&gt; Person in front breaks out of their trance and scurries along. 

\&gt; Get to the top of the opposing base and essentially fall to the ground. 

\&gt; After reaching the bottom, sharting starts. 

\&gt; Power walk to restroom, feeling shart accumulate in underwear. 

\&gt; Make it to the restroom before the dam gives in. 

\&gt; Call mother crying."
Supply and demand. He's not an asshole for growing tobacco. It's not his fault people smoke. It's like blaming Mc Donalds for people getting fat.
Are there paramedics on every train?
I guess I'm just a colon-half-full kind of guy
"Not personally as I was raised around farming it, but it will forever prevent me from smoking."
Wrapper for cigars only
Been there.
"Of course! And thank you, I’ll pass the sentiment on to my family! Agriculture is so often overlooked that I enjoy sharing as much as I can, even if I may likely be the last generation in my family to experience it"
"I weigh myself at a weight loss clinic every week. My focus is really more about logging my meals and doing good healthy meal prep and fixing my routines/lifestyle choices.

There's been weeks when I've lost only a half pound, but when I get checked at the clinic, it turns out that the the increases in my lean muscle mass actually cancelled out my loss in fat.

So the numbers can be deceiving, I've had enough occasions where weighing myself, I thought ""Oh GOD I made no progress, my weight reached a plateau!"" When in actuality, I lost 3lb of fat and gained 2.5 in muscle, which is a GOOD thing and significant progress!"
Is it true they have professional pushers that shove people into trains? I always wondered if that was a myth.
Unfortunate. Is the heat bad up there?
"Oh wow! This was a fascinating read. I just read it to my wife, too. Thank you *so much* for taking the time to reply in such detail. I am very impressed with the world you have built there, and wish you much success in the future!"
are you rich?
"To be honest, shart is easier to deal with than a full on poo. This has happened to me. 

Step 1. Head to the closest restroom.

Step 2. Grab paper towels then go into the handicap stall. 

Step 3. Assess the damages. If none has gotten onto the pants, take off the underwear, wipe the shart up a bit. Throw the underwear away in the trash. 

Step 4. Pray that no one conducting the interview was in the restroom or the elevator."
"Do you have IBS? Crohn's disease? Because what you describe is very real for those people.

Either way great to see you have a sense of humour about it. I don't doubt it's less than funny in real life."
IBS yes. It is rampant in my family. The situations that I have lived through are not fun. I have a mental map of my office and the best routes to take to avoid people and get to a restroom or to my car.
"In an elevator, on the way up to a job interview you wanted to let out that little fart so it didn't come back mid interview, but oops it was a shart"
What was the moment where you realized those weren't your beliefs?
Ever thought of writing a book on the subject? It could and should become a bestseller around the world.
CT actually
I didnt think conservatives knew how to travel.
"Im sorry, but I need to know. Mid-sex?"
"I grew up in a home with a lot of casual racism which laid the groundwork, and I had a rough childhood for a variety of reasons. As an older teenager I struggled with finding friends and was very sheltered and naive. Some of the first adult friends I had came across as normal, cool, and interesting people. They introduced me to their ideas slowly over a period of time so that it seemed less extreme, and the way they spoked seemed so educated that it was easy to accept certain things as truth."
You gotta get creative. Or else things get really boring.
"Not sure if you are serious, but I could make a funny info-graphic type book. My girlfriend has an amazing eye for design."
"First off, as a person of color who is exhausted, thanks for coming around.

We now often hear about this trope:

*The troubled teen (always a boy) wanted to find somewhere to fit in and turned to racist ideologies to assuage his insecurities and give him a sense of community and belonging. He was radicalized from the increasingly pervasive recesses of the internet, but as a man learned the error of his ways from interacting with a select number of open-hearted leftists, and now is a staunch progressive  and activist, advocating for people of color*

My question is: what percent of the white supremacists do you think can be categorized under that familiar trope and how many are just plain racist assholes that truly believe that whites are superior? Is this trope overused or is it accurate in reflecting the majority of white supremacists? Would you guess that Richard Spencer and other leaders fall into this trope or somewhere else?

Do you think education, namely lack of higher education, contributes to this ideology?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your time, and thank you for your advocacy. We need you."
"Missed opportunity. Open the phone box and make your one call. Afterwards, spread your cheeks apart as far as possible and press them onto the open phone box - making as much of a seal as possible with an emphasis on the bottom. Blast it into the phone box and close the door. Clean up with an extra clothing accessory - yours or someone else's. Jam it into the phone box too."
"Some say you are still standing there, replying to this thread butt-clenched statuesque."
"The sad thing is that my family has lived in non-white, non-english-speaking countries, but everyday racism is so pervasive and it is hard not to react with denial or outrage when accused of it. When it's something you've lived for many years, it takes a lot of time and empathy to unravel yourself from. Thank you for your well wishes. I feel terrible for my past and while I never did anything violent to anyone, my words alone keep my up at night sometimes. There are many ways to hurt people and my thoughts most certainly did that."
"I remember reading this horror story: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/5t95ch/til_that_in_2015_someone_did_a_shit_so_bad_on_a/"
"'I mean, there's only SO many different ways you can shit your pants...'

'I'll be damned...'"
How many fake breasts do you see daily?
Pretty sure it's just you losing hot air 😆
"I just want everyone to know - this scenario played out in real life for me and it worked out great. I was so focused on tensing my drawstring that I lasted forever - and I got super squirmy which is apparently advantageous. Afterwards I had to do a light speed ""harvesting static electricity"" shuffle down the hall to the most distant bathroom - which raised some brows. Overall - 9/10. Would do again."
So what’s the story of who started it?
"Does the solar flare or the electronic device cause me to poo? 

If the lack of electronic devices causes me to poo, then I am calmly walking to the closest bathroom. Moral of most of my plans, do not drive, sit down or in anyway spread it."
"&gt; Step 7. Try not to do it again.

Jesus fucking Christ XD"
"I didn't know everyone's backstory but the ones I did know were almost always societal misfits or had some reason to be angry at the world. There's only one, maybe two people I can think of who retrospectively seemed to truly believe themselves superior, and they were leaders in the group. I think the trope is likely true more often than not, but I think it's safer to always assume you're dealing with the narcissists. I don't have much of an opinion on Richard Spencer only because it feels like armchair psychology. I think his ex-wife's stories of abuse tell us plenty about his capacity to care about others, and I think he is dangerous. That's about as much as I have to say.

I do think education plays a part, for a variety of reasons. Better exposure to other cultures, better critical thinking skills, learning how to identify fake sources etc. are small things that can make a difference.

I'm not sure if this is surprising, but I'm actually a woman.

I feel odd about being thanked, honestly, but I appreciate your kindness."
"There is not, but I have a Master's in Education and charmed the right people."
That sentence needs more punctuation to be complete.
You're officiating your best friend's wedding at an outdoor space and you are about to begin the service. You are in all white linen.
"Yeah that's a tough one. You'll also need an excuse for why the waters in the raft is slight brown and smells. I'd stay silent on the matter unless it's brought up. Then if it is, make up some lie that you read that this stretch is where salmon come to spawn and die, thus darkening the water and making it smell bad.They only reason you can't see it outside the raft is because the water is moving so fast... Plausible enough to buy you enough time to do the cleanup."

"Indeed. Speared five plants to a lath, four tiers high, as long as the barn goes for a few months to cure."
Will there be a sitcom?
No.
[Never meet your heroes.](https://i.imgur.com/K5xp0F7.png)
Any moral dilemma?
"Step 1. Lift butt off of the seat as to not press the poo into any material. 
Step 2. Loosen belt and button to allow the poo to get off of my butt. 
Step 3. Hazards on, get into the breakdown lane. 
Step 4. If I get pulled over, calmly explain the situation and inform the officer of a bowel related disease that causes this to happen. Hope for no ticket. 
Step 5. Go home and clean up.
Step 6. Call job interview and tell them I had a medical emergency and that I'd understand if I lose the opportunity to interview.
Step 7. Go back to dream care auto wash and get the borchhcrob special detail package."
"No questions here, just wanted to wish you continued success on your health journey, fam."
"A part of it was being sick of having my body be the one thing stopping me from doing what I want: hiking with friends, sports I used to enjoy, etc. My body was stopping me from enjoying what I wanted to do, and because of this, it worsened a lot of mental health issues I wrestled with.

But really, the big kicker was watching my father's health deteriorate badly over the last decade because he didn't take care of himself and neglected his health. It was horrible to see a man go from running his first 5k run and being super fulfilled, to watching him smoke, drink, and neglect himself to the point where his memory and body is failing him more each day.

I vowed never to let that happen to me without a fight, and that I would prevent a generational cycle of self destruction start anew. That's the straw that pushed me to change my life.

Honestly, looking good for others has nothing to do with it for me. I wouldn't mind being chubby or stocky as long as I'm healthy and fulfilled."
"OP has said they want to lose 100lbs which I'm guessing means they are quite overweight. When you go from putting on weight/maintaining a large amount of body fat to actively dieting and exercising, your body loses quickly at first and then balances out. When I first started losing weight I lost 30lbs in 3 months too but after that my body regulated itself and I was losing around 1 to 1.5lbs a week on average."
In VA?
Amen. That pose is worst experience a person can go through. One move and your underwear will witness a splatter fest.
It depends on the job. Usually I start at $20 + gas + expenses. So it adds up. Plus it's all under the table and cash.
Any of your crops end up as chew or dip?
"I am pretty ashamed to say it nearly happens 1-2 times a day. Random situations. Sitting on the couch, in a movie, at work, deep cough, swinging a bat."
were you gone? reduced to atoms?
Solar flare that tales out all electronic devices. What do you do?
"That's honestly an easier situation. Pooping myself may make me a laughing stock, but it would definitely draw attention to the show. 

If the bubbles are on:

Step 1. Let some come out, immediately shift to a spot a few feet away, but definitely not straight across the hot tub. 

Step 2. Wait until the first person reacts. Then freak out and get out of the hot tub. 

Step 3. Quietly make my way to the restroom and complete the deed. Hopefully I am not confronted about the situation."
Actually a lot.
Are you straight?
Holt shit OP turned out a little disappointing
That's interesting. Are there professional certification programs for this profession?
"Because my beliefs now don't involve anyone being superior to anyone else, and have been molded by considering other people's hardships and not just my own. I took a lot of time to carefully consider the things I stand for now, regardless of how popular or unpopular they made me. I can feel good about my stances now."
"I would consider myself quite far to the left (as far as what Americans consider left) politically and socially, almost the complete opposite of how I would have identified then.

I think social platforms make these ideas more accessible to people who are the way I was when I got drawn into it - angry, isolated, feeling downtrodden or persecuted. When you're angry or depressed, and you don't know why, it's easy to buy into a magical answer - ""this is what is causing your problems, and you can get mad at it with other people just like you!"" Content on YouTube is good propaganda because people can have scripted, professional-looking videos. They can sound educated and like what they're presenting are facts, and viewers don't necessarily question how extreme it is, because it's on a popular site that kids visit."
"It's a bit tough right now, due to the sanctions imposed on our country. Most people are just struggling to supply their family. Besides that, we have never had so much personal freedoms, but it's not a priority now under this tough economical circumstances. But people are always kind and empathetic and warm in Iran. That's one of the few things that keep this whole diverse nation together."
What was that for
Brilliant way to save face.  Everybody will assume that the bowel evacuation occurred postmortem.
"This may surprise some, but anti Semitism was always where I drew the line. I met someone at the time who was a Holocaust denier and broke off our relationship partly because of it."
"So you’d said you’d never smoke because of what goes in it/on it. 

So what’s that stuff you refuse to put in your body."
"Ah, I assumed I already pooped."
I feel like I could achieve this if I stopped smoking the weed and eating an entire pie before bed.
Does it affect your ability to go to work/school? Is there a medication that helps?
"I would say I've had it for about 5 years. Due to medical issues I went from being slightly overweight to underweight and people would always tell me I was too skinny and looked unhealthy. I was aware I was an unhealthy weight but there was nothing I could do about it. It started off with your usual insecurities and developed overtime into where I started to notice I wasn't thinking right. It becomes a bit of an obsession where you either constantly look at your body and analyse everything that you hate, to avoiding looking at yourself completely. I go through stages where I'll put my head down when I pass a mirror so I don't see myself. 

I don't believe compliments people give me as I believe they're doing it out of pity."
"Of course I am serious, think about it, one bestseller that comes to mind is world War z which is basically a zombie survival guide. But how realistic is such a thing? Diarrhea is unavoidable in life, so why not learn from the master how to avoid disasters in life."

No. I am a white guy and I made sure to treat everyone equal based on their behavior. Inmates tried to play the white card on me all the time and I always told them to fuck off.  I am proud to say I did my best to treat everyone fairly.

"Those making the extraordinary claims are the ones who need to show god is real. If I claimed the universe is run by an invisible purple unicorn who likes to play ""Yahtzee"" and said ""Well you can't prove me wrong!"", that doesn't make the invisible purple unicorn true.

"A couple reasons, I have chronic hives and hot water makes them worse, I work in the heat all day, and also I work around a lot of fiber glass. With that being said I actually prefer a cold shower now. I used to make my self take cold showers before I had hives or worked when I was surfing a lot so I could acclimate my self to the cold water for winter swells."
"I think his comments are horrible and the fact people are not only excusing it, but actually applauding it, is frightening.

I think some of the best things we can do is call it out amongst our peers, even when it's uncomfortable for us. Be kind for the sake of it to other people. Take time to include people you normally wouldn't. Always educate someone if you can before kicking them to the curb. You can't make anyone care about other people, and you can't make anyone learn, but you can at least provide them with the materials they need if they choose to use them."

"I have not, though I familiarized myself with the concept of intermittent fasting.

I think that while it works for many, I'm not sure it was the best choice for me. I know that when I did try to fast, far too often I over-ate on the first meal afterwards, and it would sorta backfire on me.

But I can't deny it's worked for people. What works for one person may not work for another."

"99.99% of the kids that I watch are boys so anything where they can runaround or explore always works. Especially hide and seek (even older kids) or Nerf War.

"I'm sorry to hear that. Now, a question. Ronald Reagan or Richard Nixon?"
"It depends on what you mean by glamorous? Interestingly, a lot of the kids that I watch have issues. I honestly believe it's because the parents have them and that their parents were well in their late 30s or older when they had them. So that brings an element of chaos. You still deal with all the crying, tantrums, etc. Probably more.

Travelling isn't all that. Sure you get to go to nice places, but it's a working holiday. Trying to keep one to four kids busy all day is hard work."
"It's the 23rd mile of the NYC marathon. You're leading the race by 50 meters and feeling good. Both you and your nearest opponent are going all out and neither is giving up ground. There's TV cameras all around you. There's motorcycles and crowd control vehicles following you. The crowd is cheering your name.

Suddenly, you realize you shouldn't have eaten that whole bag of prunes and box of Fiber Crisps ten minutes before the race began. Probably that Super Burrito last night was also a bad idea. And that family size bag of sugar-free Gummi Bears is not high on your list of best decisions. And washing it all down with a six-pack of Milk of Magnesia, just bone-headed, let's be honest.

You feel a world record attempt brewing between your butt cheeks. It's in a dead sprint from your stomach to your final safety valve, which is now bulging under the pressure. At your current pace you're still a good 15 minutes from the finish line. 

What do you do?"

"Goddamn. Okay, here's one. 

You're on a bus. Imagine a Greyhound, except there's no bathroom. You're going a distance of 250km (I don't know, 150 miles?). It's a hot summer day. Bus is cruising, AC is on, but because of the nature of the bus, you can't roll windows down. Bus is jam-packed, and it's warm. You've got your own seat, but there's not a lot of wiggle room. The row behind you? A mother and her child. Row ahead? Young couple. Row beside you? Man in business attire. You've got your spare pants with you, your iPhone, a book and some headphones. You guys pulled out of the parkway 10 minutes ago, and the bus driver says your next stop isn't for at least 45 minutes, but depending on traffic, can be as long as an hour and fifteen minutes."

"I adore them. I would not work with them if I did not like them. I had a few families that I quit on not so much because of the kid, but because the parents were batshit crazy or tried ripping me off. For me, it's more important that the parents and I get along than the kids. The kids will always like me. Usually I am like God when they first meet me, then they hate me, then I become like their favorite uncle."
"We do not use Round-Up as our seed is legacy harvested and not immune, but we do apply small amounts of other chemicals directly to the stem of the plant with the intent to not get it on the smokable leaf or in direct contact with the ground.

We irrigate using ground water, so protecting those sources from contamination is of great importance to us."

"The big thing I'm wondering is whether you are losing weight too fast. The danger in doing so is losing muscle along with fat. Have you done the dunk tank tests to check to see whether you are losing muscle along with fat? I'm familiar with the BMR approach and am highly in favor of it, but when I looked into it (and used it to lose 30 pounds), what I read cautioned not to lose more than a pound and a half a week. Lose more than that, I recall reading, and you're probably losing muscle -- which you do NOT want to do.  


I like your general approach a lot, but if I were you I'd get myself to a dunk tank every few weeks and make sure I was losing only fat."

Not really to both questions.
I did that for 5 years and never brought in anything illegal. I trained 5+officers and know they never broke the law. Getting illegal drugs into the system is much harder than you'd think. At least in my county. The amount of strip searches I performed scarred me.
Never. I held my position for 5 years and always treated everyone with respect

You have a backpack on full of beer that you and your friends brought to the party, but you were selected as the carrier. You live roughly 10 blocks away."

What you described is an unbelievably tricky situation... 

Depending on the time of day, the number of people involved, and whether or not you are inside of the pool there are a couple of ways to navigate through it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Night time, less than 4 people, not in the pool yet:

Step 1. Quickly put separation between you, your date, and the group. Try to find a darker region in the area. 

Step 2. Wait until everyone is beginning to strip down, quickly take your pants and underwear down and try to throw the underwear over the fence without anyone noticing. 

Step 3. If no one notices, you are good. If people do notice, do not say you pooped yourself. It will not look good to your date. Play it off as if there was some kind of terrifying bug in it, or something else. Blame an external factor.

Step 4. Make sure you are 80% clean before hoping in, otherwise the poo will in fact disperse off of you. 

Step 5. Have a good night, free ball it, you are kosher. 

&amp;#x200B;

Night time, more than 4 people, not in the pool yet:

Step 1. Step back away from the group and say you need to grab something from your car. You'd be surprised how well poop will stay within your underwear. 

Step 2. Hop the fence, scurry to the car, clean yourself off, throw out the underwear, grab something of note from the car.

Step 3. Return to the pool and have a good time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Night time, less than 4 people, in the pool:

Step 1. If it isn't straight water, you should have enough time to play it off before it comes floating up. If you see it... you can try to commit to grabbing it and throwing it out. That is an expert level move and a huge margin of error. Risk reward is heavily skewed. 

Step 2. You may be SOL... 

&amp;#x200B;

Night time, more than 4 people, in the pool:

Step 1. Swim to another part of the pool, do not go in a straight line, do not go to the opposite part of the pool. Be calm.

Step 2. Wait for someone else to react, play dumb and repulsed by someone else's actions.

Step 3. Hopefully life goes according to plan.

&amp;#x200B;

In all 4. Do not admit to it, do not move in a straight line to avoid, act natural. 

&amp;#x200B;

Day time... It's easy if you are clothed, follow the first two. If you are already naked, just leave."

"Wear your backpack facing forward. Just squish in with everyone make sure u don’t smell because it’s gonna be hot , wet, and humid. They don’t mind foreigners in big cities I was just in Tokyo yesterday no problem at all. Also there is no ladies first rule so just barge through with your spouse. ( don’t push or force) you’ll be surprised how many people fit on the damn train. Also hold on to the railing on top because of you slip you might take out 20 people along with you. (Happened twice in one train ride in Osaka) you’ll be fine enjoy the good food, yakiniku, yakitori, sushi, teppanyaki, wagyu, and don’t forget unagi bowl ! Check out Chinatown in Yokohama, pretty cool spot, cheap Chinese and pretty damn good too.  Get the rail pass trust me it’s a game changer, one way shinkansen ticket can be over 100plus dollars."

"&gt; It has much more chance of becoming radical under the Democrats

More radical than concentration camps? 

&gt; Contrary to popular leftist belief, the Nazis were very much a logical development of the early 20th century American progressive movement.

Uh, no, actually leftists agree. America loved nazis until nazis (well, Japan and the Axis) hurt America. Nazis gleamed a lot of their tactics on how to oppress and kill minorities based on 1940s, pre-Civil Rights Era America.

But since you drink bleach, you're dumb enough to think ""leftists"" made nazis. But somehow, I have a sneaking suspicion that you think nazis (like Trump and his administration) are good, in which case, how is it bad that democrats take over if they're also fellow nazis?"
Both. I have a plan to evacuate from the situation and a plan to complete the action.
