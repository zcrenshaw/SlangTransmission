"So this saga started on Wednesday. I called at my lunch hour around 1:45PM EST and asked to cancel my membership, the receptionist told me only the Operations Manager can cancel memberships and she is on lunch. I asked when she would be back, and was told 2:30PM. I called back at 2:45PM and was told she was still at her lunch. I called one final time on Wednesday at 4PM and was told by a different receptionist the same line of ""Only an Operations Manager can cancel memberships and she is on lunch."" I left a message with her and waited for a call.  
 
At 3PM on Thursday I called once again and was told the same line. (Call 4)  
Me: ""That is fine, I will hold until she gets back.""  
Receptionist 1 (R1): ""Are you sure? It might be a while.""  
Me: ""Yep I will wait.""
--- 5 Minutes Later---  
Operations Manager (N): ""Hi this is Naomi, how can I help you?""  
Me: ""Hi Naomi, I would like to cancel my membership.""  
N: “We only cancel membership in person between the hours of 10AM and 3PM, Monday through Friday.”  
Me: “That isn’t going to work for me Naomi, I work.”  
N: “Well you can send in a form, but that can take weeks to process.”  
Me: “No, you are not charging me for extra time, we are going to cancel this now.”  
N: “I cannot do that.”  
Me: “Why not?”  
N: “Because we cannot verify who you are over the phone.”  
Me: “But you can through mail?”  
N hangs up.  

 
I immediately call back. (Call 5)  
R1: “Hi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?”  
Me: “Please redirect me to Naomi, thank you.”  
--- Hold for 10 minutes ---  
N: “This is Naomi, how may I help you?”  
Me: “Hi Naomi, it seems like our call dropped, this is BabstheBeagle again. I would like to cancel my membership.”   -	Side Note: I know the call didn’t drop, I just have worked in customer service before and know that a nice person is more likely to get their way.  
N: “As I said, we only do that through person or through the mail, I will not be able to help you today.”   
Me: “Yes you will Naomi, I will continue calling until you are able to. I know you can.”  
N: “I was trained in December and that will not be happening.”  
Me: “Yes it will be, I do not care who you have to call to make this happen.”  
N: “I will not be canceling this membership over the phone.”   
Me: “Then we will be..”  
Boop, N hangs up again  
Me: “speaking a lot today.”    


Call 6  
R1: “Hi this is..”  
Me: “Transfer me to Naomi.”  
Boop, R1 hangs up.    

 
Call 7 – 10   
The receptionist never answered my call, they just put me on hold.

     
I work in an open office space so all my coworkers have heard me trying to cancel this membership at this point. I borrow a coworker’s phone and call back. (Call 11)  
R1: “Hi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?”  
Me: “Hi, can I speak to the Operations Manager?”  
R1: “Sure! Let me transfer you.”  
--- Naomi almost immediately answers ---  
N: “This is Naomi, how may I help you?”    
Me: “Hi Naomi, this is BabstheBeagle again.”  
Boop, N hangs up.  
  
This is where I start to have fun. I borrow multiple coworkers phones, calling back and asking for Naomi. After 4 more calls, they eventually get me to Naomi. At this point it is around 4:50PM. (Call 12)  
N: “Hi BabstheBeagle, you know I cannot cancel this.”  
Me: “Naomi, you must know that I will not stop calling until you do. Why again can’t you cancel this over the phone?”   
N: “Because I cannot verify who you are.”  
Me: “I will shoot you a text with my fingerprints, face, nostrils, I will even buy you plastic surgery so you cancel this for me.”  
N: “I cannot.”  
Me: “Please transfer me to your manager.”  
N: “I already spoke to him, I am not allowed to cancel this.”  
Me: “I do not care if you spoke to him, transfer me now.”  
N: “I will not be doing that. Have a nice day.”  
Me: “NAOMI DO NOT HANG UP ON ME.”  
Boop, she is gone again.   
 

Call 13 – 15 they keep on ignoring me.   
 

Call 16 – 5:01PM  
Receptionist 2 (R2): “Hi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?”  
Me: “I am just trying to cancel my membership.”   
R2: “Well we are unable to do that, only the operations manager can and she just left for the day.”  
Me: “I do not care, I will continue to call until you find someone that can cancel this membership.”  
R2: “I am here until 10:30PM, talk to you soon.”  
Boop, hung up on again.   
 

There is a funny thing about LA Fitness call system. When they put you on hold a message pops up saying “Thank you for calling LA Fitness, your call means a lot to us, we will answer you shortly.” Every time I heard “Thank you” I hung up and called again. This was purely to make sure that their phone was constantly ringing. This happened for call 17 – 24.  
 
Call 25  
Ross (GM): “Hi BabstheBeagle this is Ross, you have been told that we can’t cancel your membership unless the Operations Manager does it. She is no longer here. I am the General Manager and I can’t even do it.”  
Me: “Hi Ross, I have talked to your Operations Manager multiple times, I will continue calling tonight unless you cancel this membership. If you can’t do it, find someone who can.”    
GM: “Give me a minute.”  
Me: “Sure Ross.”  
--- Hold for a minute or two ---  
GM: “Alright BabstheBeagle, this is the number of another location. The OM named Caleb is expecting your call and he will cancel your membership.”  
Me: “Thank you Ross, you are clearly the only one there with brain cells.”  
GM: “Have a good one.”  

 
Call 26  
Receptionist 3 (R3): “Hi, this is LA Fitness, how may I help you?”  
Me: “Hi, I am calling for Caleb, he is expecting my call.”  
R3: “Yep, he is just with a client right now, please hold for a minute.”   
--- Hold for a bit ---  
Caleb (C): “Hi BabstheBeagle, how can I help you?”  
Me: “Hi Caleb, you have to cancel my membership.”  
C: “Have to?”    
Me: “Do you know how I got to you?”  
C: “Yes, you wouldn’t stop calling.”  
Me: “What makes you think that will change just cause you tell me no.”  
--- Long Pause ---   
C: “Alright, let me verify some information and I will cancel this for you.”  
Me: “You are a saint among ding dongs.”  


Caleb proceeded to unhappily cancel my membership. This call ended at approximately 5:30PM.  I did not curse once, but I think every employee at LA Fitness hates me now and I couldn’t care less.   
 
Also sorry if this is horrible to read. I am a sucky writer and honestly have no intention of getting better.

"Sister: I'm sorry, I can't join a gym over the phone.

LA Fitness: Why not?

Sister: Because I can't verify who you are."
"What's amusing is they're so eager to sign you up over the phone. I went to an LA fitness with my sister a few weeks ago and they WON'T STOP CALLING. 

So--good for you. This story made me laugh. "
TIL my wife is asexual 
"You planning to tell your ex-wife and say ""Who's your daddy, now?"" "
She was better
"I'm gonna need you to talk me through the whole timeline of this, your majesty."
DON'T YOU WISH THAT EVIL ON ME!
"She sent me a text last night while I was at work and asked if she can borrow some money. I said sure I’ll be home after 8 pm. She got to my house at 845, came in and we just talked.  I offered her a bottle of water and we sat on the couch but not too close to each other. No hints of any kind of attraction, it felt like normal conversation we’ve always had for the past 14 years. 

Suddenly she said she really appreciates the money and she’ll pay me back the following Friday. I said don’t worry it isn’t that much it’s fine, take your time. 

She then reached out and placed her hand on my inner thigh. She looked at me and chuckled. She said, “Will you let me suck your dick?”

I was stunned and immediately replied, “Um, it’s not that much money you don’t have to do that”

She said it’s not because of the money your borrowing me, I really want to do it. I said “umm, sure”

She kind of helped pull it out, it was already hard.  She stroked it for a minute, took off her shirt, pulled her breasts out of her bra and just did it. "
I bet you still get billed next cycle.
You just have to submit a customer service request for your order and you will receive a full refund if your order was never delivered. They only give partial coupons if they deliver the food and something was missing/incorrect

I'll be impressed if you can successfully get Serius XM to stop calling you.

We ran that stop light way back.

"This brings back memories of trying to cancel my 24-hour fitness membership. 


I went into the place on my lunch since it was near my work. Like you they said it had to be done by a manager, which they called over. When he got to the desk he asked the person I was talking to what the issue was. When they told the manager that I was looking to cancel membership the manager just shook his head no at them, never once acknowledged my presence, and walked away. The front desk lady gave me an 800 number to call. 


Of course I was on hold for an hour. At the time I worked a retention line for a customer service team so I knew the game that was about to be played and spent the time on hold developing a plan. 

CSR: Hello, how can I help you today?

Me: Yes I need to cancel my membership. I tried to do it at the location but they said I had to call this number. 

Verify some information to pull up the account. 

CSR: now before I continue I have to enter your cancel reason. 

Me: I have diabetes and in two months both my lower legs and one of my hand will be amputated. I will be going through an rehab program and I will not longer be able to use the equipment available at your gyms.

Short but noticeable pause

CSR: Are you sure you will no longer be needing your membership. 

Me: Yes.

CSR: Ok, I will get that cancelled for you now. 


Of course I think this is over, but was I ever wrong. 


I went on with life not giving it another though, until a month later when I got charged again. I went back into the local gym and they verified there was a note to cancel my account added on the date I called. So the lady at the front desk, the same one I had originally talked to, said that she would clear it up but was not allowed to refund the last payment. I was like whatever, I just want it over. 

And again, the next month, boom I get hit with a charge. 

It took several more calls and going into the local gym while having the same conversation before it was finally done. 


I WILL NEVER EVER JOIN A GYM OR SUGGEST TO ANYONE THAT THEY JOIN A GYM.


Every now an then 24 hour fitness will come to the office to try to sign people up with a discount. Every time they do I go to my HR department and tell them my story that I am very upset they are allowed to swindle others. A few times that has ended up with them being asked to leave.

Amicably ramming your cock into your ex-mother in laws mouth. I'd have done the same. 
Definitely always wanted to. You missed the signals.
"You know, it's actually pretty crazy. There wasn't a single moment on that beach where I thought that my injuries would have killed me. They didnt hurt that bad. I could still walk, sing, and climb high enough to avoid the tide. 

It wasnt until I reached the hospital and they told me that someone with my injuries would normally only have a 20% chance to survive. And that's if they had been treated immediately after receiving them. I forgot to put in my post that I also had a collapsed lung. 

I wouldn't have had any idea that my injuries were actually deadly. I never felt close to death on that beach. So death never really ran through my mind. To be honest, the experience wasn't even necessarily a sad one, on my end of things. 

Like, I had a plan for day 8. For a new way to get the attention of the drivers at the top of the cliff. Giving up wasn't on my mind at all. 

When I first realized that I was in an accident I thought, ""you know, you've had a pretty beautiful life, Angela."" 

I felt content, really. With either way it could have worked out. "
"Yes, I did. I might have said dinguses. "
I'm just going to chill and relax tomorrow.
No. 
I work in the medical field for 12 years and I've been burnt out for a long time. Had a difficult patient (adult patient temper tantrum) this morning. I feel like I have reached my limitfor dealing with peoples bullshit. 
"Good job not talking with the police. I'm a criminal defense attorney whose practice is focused on defending people accused of child sexual abuse. The number one reason innocent people end up in prison is because they talk to the police.

"Next time she asks about your kids, you can point out she ate the last batch."

At any time in your past did you have both arms in plaster at the same time?
"This was amazing! I applaud your persistence and patience!

PS - Did you really tell Caleb 'You are a saint among ding dongs'?"
"I did this once, and within 24 hours was working at nearly twice the salary... sometimes it's the right thing to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Go look at doing things that you have dreamed about."
"I'm not currently working with any TV series, news stations, or magazines. And I don't really have any plans to work with any in the future.

I feel like once people do that, the story no longer becomes theirs. It becomes whatever they think the public will want to hear or eat up. My story feels simple to me, because it was simple to me. 

As for flashbacks, I've only had one really. My mom was driving and ran over a rock and it made a sound similar to what I heard over and over again while rolling down the cliff. Kind of shook me a bit, because it's such a unique sound. 

I definitely have dreams about the whole thing. I would never say that what I experienced was traumatizing to me. So, when I look back at it, it feels beautiful. It feels like a lesson. And my dreams reflect that. "
"Don't want to hijack your AMA, but I want to pop in and just say, **FUCK LA Fitness.**

I took them up on their offer for a free 1 on 1 with a personal trainer. I knew they were going to try and rope me into signing up for it, but what I didn't expect was how aggressive they would be about it. It was frankly disgusting.

I went to see what sort of routine one expects with a personal trainer and wanted to see what it was like. At the end of the experience, I told them I needed to go home and think about it, and they went *batshit insane*. They did everything in their power to keep me from leaving. They spent over 2 hours trying to talk me into it (*""Why do you need to think about it? What is there to think about?""* over and over and over); the manager pretended to call a ""higher up"" to get me a ""better deal"", which he faked SO badly. He tried to tell me that my girlfriend might leave me if I don't get in slightly better shape, and when that didn't work, he started to argue that eventually I might *die* from health problems (""No doubt in my mind you're probably pre-diabetic"", despite the fact that my doctor said otherwise *and* I'm not even that obese...) and he literally, I shit you not, began to say, repeatedly, ""I'm trying to save your life"" and started to conjure up scenarios in which I was dead and how it would make my family feel. (**edit**: For the sake of clarity, the dude saying that was the manager on duty trying to sell me on the trainer's service, not the personal trainer himself. The personal trainer was, at worst, complicit with his boss's shady tactics, and while also a douche, was not overtly offensive like he was.) 

That's when I was like holy FUCK I have to get out of here *now*. As soon as he walked away to help another customer for a moment I fucking bolted out of the gym. 

When I came back two weeks later to cancel my membership - on the final day that I could before the next month started - they refused to cancel it. It was, of course, the same fucker as before; He told me they couldn't cancel it after 5 PM because no one there had permissions to do so. This is probably the first and only time that I *lost my fucking shit*. I went off on the dude, how he is full of total shit, how this is a fucking scam, etc. And *this fucker decides to get mouthy right back at me*. On the fucking job. He starts cussing back at me, dropping F-bombs, and at one point, he grabbed a box of donuts and sarcastically was like ""You want one? You look like you could use it.""

So yeah. Didn't get to cancel until the next day at which point they charged me for the next month anyway, but the GM there who listened to my tirade was actually pretty nice and apologetic, said it was impossible to refund though. She said she would investigate the problems I went through and would take action.

But yeah. Fuck LA Fitness. I hope these shady fucks go out of business.

TL;DR - LA Fitness is skeevy as fuck and tried to shame me into signing up for their personal trainer and then made fun of me when I tried to cancel my membership."

"I only tried to eat something once, but it wasn't out of desperation. I knew I had to eat something because of the length of time I had been down there. To be honest, my stomach didn't growl once that entire time. I never felt hungry. It was more a logical thing for me. 

There were aloe plants scattered throughout the shore and along the cliff. I know aloe is edible so I figured I'd give it a try. I ate one leaf, but then freaked out because they were all a reddish &amp; green tint and I had no idea if they were actually safe to eat. I felt that way about all of the plants along the shore. I wasn't sure, so I didn't try. 

My family definitely knew something was wrong. My sister knew something was wrong the same day as my crash. 

My family &amp; friends worked together to try and find me. They used every resource they could have to spread the word of my disappearance and even drove up and down California searching for me or my vehicle. I'm so humbled by their efforts to find me. 

I've never felt more love in my life!!!"
She is on lunch.
Is one side of your face sagging?
"I “canceled” my LA Fitness membership by calling several times, mailing their sheet, and then finally showing up in person. I had to try showing up 3 separate times on different days to get this on my lunch break during the recommended time window and finally finding the operations manager on the 3rd visit. 

I got billed the next month.

I called and was able to cancel it by insisting I had already shown up in person and got refunded. It was a miracle. 

I do genuinely think that if I had acted like I already canceled from the start it might have worked from the beginning, but I definitely don’t want to sign up again to test my theory. "

"PlanetFitness did the same thing. I called them up 3 months before my 1 year membership expired and they explained their early termination fees which just happened to be higher than the remaining three months, so I told them I would cancel in 3 months. I call the first day into the last month and they cancel my membership. However, before the month ends, they charge me a renewal fee for the next year. I call them back, explain the situation and they tell me that I'm out of luck. I laugh and tell them THEY are out of luck. 

I called up my bank, explained the situation and had that shit charged back within a day and blocked all further transactions from PlanetFitness.

Fuck 24/7 gyms. I refuse to set up direct deposits for services nowadays because of them. "

"Thank you, I have a ton of respect for criminal defense attorneys and I appreciated my attorney being open and honest as to how hard of a battle we faced, but also outlined his entire strategy with multiple backup strategies.

"I once called a car dealership 322 times over the course of 90 days until they threatened to call the police on me for harassment.  

Long story, they didn't make good on promises IN WRITING citing that the sales person that made those promises had no authorization to do so.  When i asked why the manager signed off, i was told (and i shit you not) ""the managers don't review each and every letter written on a ""we owe you"" form"".  

In the end, i got what was coming to me, but it took a lot of effort to do so.  I'm also the guy that never ever ever goes away.  I will happily spend more time cost than value if i feel like i'm being screwed.  I applaud you, OP."
"Oh I’ll be sucking up to her, literally. "
"I argued with the patient, which I never do. I always just tell them what they want to hear, kiss their ass. Not today. I argued with her and then packed up my shit, sent an email to my bosses, and left. fuck it."
... so your children’s grandmother is cheating on her husband with you? 
What are you planning to do tomorrow?
Now for your ex to suck you dad’s dick. 
"That’s the easiest way I’ve found to cancel these kind of things. 

1. Phone call telling them to cancel
2. Follow up with an email to the gym including who you talked to, when it took place, and explaining that this is now cancelled and you will be disputing any charges with your CC. 
3. If they charge you again dispute it with your CC issuer and provide them a copy of the email. 
4. When they gym calls saying your monthly renewal didn’t go through and they need an updated CC to link to the account remind them you cancelled and if they’d like to try to charge you they’ll have to contact your CC issuers legal team. 

It’s not like these gyms can afford to get into a legal dispute with MasterCard or visa, so they just give up. At most is 2 phone calls and 2 emails and you’re free of them. "
"I think the amount I second guess myself.

That was one of the most heartbreaking parts."
No regret at all right now. It's been long time coming. When I got in my car I cried tears of joy.

"First, enjoy those dreams.  Mine got crazy after I quit smoking.  Second, the first month is the hardest, another month from now and you will have days where you don't even think about smoking.  Third, if you do decide to smoke again, take it easy.  Your tolerance probably already reset to that of a non-smoker, it will hit you hard as fuck.  Fourth, congratulations.  And finally, what was your favorite thing to do while stoned that you don't enjoy sober?  For me it's video games.  They're so good when you're stoned that I don't really enjoy them anymore.  I played my whole life, way before I started smoking weed, but after I quit pot I just didn't enjoy them anymore.

"I went to the ER where they confirmed I had a tapeworm, and they gave me this medication called Biltricide, an anti-parasitic. I took it last night and I’ve had the worst stomach ache since. I learned about this last semester actually (nursing student) We have these white blood cells called eosinophils, which target parasitic worms. I haven’t learned why, but for some reason the worm has a defense mechanism where the WBCs can’t successfully engulf it. So, the medication paralyzes the worm (paralyzing it’s jaw so the teeth can’t hold onto the intestines anymore—this is what keeps it in place) and simultaneously kills it. The eosinophils begin to eat it, and whatever parts don’t get eaten will come out in my poop. Not excited for that last part, that’s how I found the worm in the first place. I felt very violated. "

What kind of relationship do you have with your surrogate mum? If any at all.
This concept has never occurred to me but I think I’m going to kick my own ass. Liar Liar style.
Reminds me of the story of the guy trying to cancel his planet fitness membership and they threatened to call the cops if he didn't stop calling. After the cops got on the phone he got his membership cancelled.
So how does that work then? Does she bite the proverbial bullet for your sake/pleasure or is it enjoyable for her once things get going? 
She didn't listen. 
"Background: my dad got into the government in the late 90s. He is province level officer ( not sure how to describe it)  He wasn’t corrupted at first, but then he was threatened by the other corrupted officers to take the bribe and “ do convenience”. So that’s basically how he didn’t get fired at first and kept ranking up until now. I had pretty good relationship with him until I was sent aboard when I was 14 and then we got not so close because both of us are not the type of person to express our feelings. Btw I’m living in Australia now and got a pretty good paying job on my own and dad is about to retire in 2 years. "
"Sounds strait out of a porno, crazy. "
roll tide 
"Honestly I didn’t really think about it.  I was drinking hard then and had totaled two cars, flipping one on a main road.  I knew I had to do something or I was gonna die.  So yeah I guess I just went with it."
Yeah I would have never let them get away with charging me after I’ve canceled 
That is much better than I was expecting. 
"That is very true! It amazes me how she can be so wise, help me out physically and emotionally, raise my children, and help encourage me to be a great wife, yet not be bossy or pushy.  

"
Not really sure? We were close but more like in a motherly and son kind of way. When I was married to her daughter she was always nice but never showed any interest sexually 
"The way I played it when I was young was that if someone had to pay a fine or bail the money would get put on free parking space, and if you landed on it you got to keep it."

McAfee?
Yes
"At any point, did you want to give up? What went through your mind?"
"I’m not sure why people are asking why you punched him. It’s obvious, and good for you. Oftentimes, it’s difficult to respond with anything other than shock. I don’t have a question, just good for you. Never let someone put their hands on you without consent. "
She’ll cremate me. Then over the course of a year she will empty my ashes in the local dog park on a daily basis via a sack mechanism concealed within her pant legs. Sort of like what the prisoners did with tunneled rock in The Great Escape. 
"Wow, that’s actually extra fucked up that the divorce was only finalized a few months ago. Imagine how much of a betrayal it might be considered if even your ex-wife’s *friend* were pursuing you now only a few months after the divorce, let alone her own mother. I can’t imagine the devastation that pursuing this could/will cause if/when the secret got out, if you were to pursue it. 

I don’t mean to shit on the “fun-and-games”/fantasy aspect of this, but to be completely frank, this reeks of crazy. What kind of mother would betray her daughter, husband, and grandkids like that? She sounds like a very unstable, mentally-unsound individual. As they say, I highly advise you not to stick your dick in crazy. If you don’t want to eventually see your ex-wife/kids crying because think you’re an asshole over the fact that you fucked their mother/grandmother, please don’t do it. I’m not trying to be mean or something, but I just want to be realistic with you about the truth of this situation rather than letting the fantasy-porn-colored glasses take over. There’s a good chance it would also catalyze yet another divorce in the family, and your kids would seriously suffer from all of the instability and betrayal. Please don’t let her be around you alone anymore, and please try to think of the reality your kids see, which you paint for them. Truthfully I just can’t see a positive outcome to this after the short-term pleasures are over. 

If you’re really lonely, maybe consider getting a hooker to pretend to be your mother-in-law or something, but playing this kind of fantasy-porn game with actual real figures in your life is really not advisable. Good luck."
"Is she capable of achieving orgasm? I know some women, including women with strong sexual desires, are not, but no idea if that's even related."
"Make sure he knows, and supports you, don't pressure yourselves to have sex, 

For Him, respect her space "
"""The number one reason innocent people end up in prison is because they talk to the police."" This is terrifying. Can you elaborate?"
.... You missed the anniversary as well didn't you 
username valid.  lol.
"One bj is still cheating and besides, who’s to say that you’re the first? "
Yes
Oh God I hope not
"Great question!  Luckily we didn't make it to a trial stage so we didn't have to face the prosecution head to head.  Talking to the detective was like talking to a brick wall and I think part of that was her trying to get me to ""crack and admit doing it.""  We unfortunately had to roll with the punches since the detective got all of her indictments from the grand jury.  This is very unfair because the defense generally isn't allowed and the hearing dates aren't made public.  

Being able to prove that I was with my roommate at home the night of the alleged offense was my greatest evidence.  Also, I was grateful that Google follows my location and I was able to have my map history from the entire day showing when I was home etc.  "
What are your thoughts now that you've had time to process everything?
She married? 
"Unsolicited advice, if you feel your partner doesn’t understand you as a human and you are already worried about the wedding you need to sit down and talk seriously about the concerns. If you go into a marriage with serious concerns, don’t go into the marriage"
Turns out most married women are asexual. Neat. 
"I am not. I repeat, I am not good at the words. "
"You can also have a friend call, pretending he's you attorney. ""Hi, I am calling from Satchel &amp; Brown. I am Phil Turd, assistant to Bob McFelon, miss Jones' attorney. Miss Jones told us she's having difficulty cancelling her membership with LA Gym. Apparently she called twice and could not get a satisfactory answer. I just want to make sure there's no simpler way to handle the situation before we look into it. '"
I wish I could upvote this ten million times
Lesson learned! Pretend I already did it. 
Absolutely. We all live together
"Did you try to eat anything out of desperation? 

Did your family or friends know something was wrong when they hadn’t heard from you? 

"
Why did you make an AMA and then not answer any question for several hours?
thank you :)
Clearly! My coworker used to work there and she said they definitely could cancel it over the phone.
"Fuck no. For one, parasites are disgusting and secondly, I actually didn’t lose much weight"
OP. You have to do this. Please...take one for the team. 
Have you tried turning her off and on again?
I think here we have a law that says that cancelling any service must be as easiear as singing up. Can you sing up via phone? you can cancel it via phone
"pretty sure you went beyond ""amicable"" when she sucked your cock there, champ."
Each woman knows of the other women? 
"There are several documented explanations.  Many of these nurses and doctors love the excitement of a code.  That is when a patient is in distress and the staff is called to try and save them.  The killer will intentionally put the patient into a code and then respond.  This is referred to as Munchhausen syndrome by Proxy.  That is intentionally harming a person then showing everyone how compassionate you are and skilled trying to make them better. 

A simple explanation is sometimes the patient just rings the buzzer too much

Patients have been murdered in hospice because they are their too old and the insurance company or governments won't pay for services any longer.  "
I made a complaint last week via the app cos the delivery driver took his sweet ass time ignoring my messages and being lost and my cold rock melted. I got a refund within like 24hrs. Have you submitted feedback on the app? 
Rest in peace.
Did you have any buddies that knew about certain things?
Exactly something a tapeworm would say.... 
"Absolutely! He has been taking morphine for his fractures since birth, I would love for him to get relief using something less dangerous. "
"I work as an uber driver and during a routine uber eats sushi delivery a seagull came through the window, grabbed the bag, and out the other.

Found it perched on the corner of a roof of a gas station, spent 30 minutes trying to get the sushi back (guy called twice and he desperately wanted this sushi, I didn't want to let him down) before giving up and cancelling the order.

AMA."
"1. How would you explain this a family member or friend who doesn't yet know about your setup?
2. How did this start? Did you discuss it beforehand or was it something that happened organically? 
3. How do you all manage jealousy?
4. What are the biggest pros/positives?
5. What are the biggest cons/negatives?
6. Do you think you will ever go back to a monogamous relationship? 
7. Would you ever introduce another man into the relationship, and if not: why not? 
8. How do you manage paying/splitting bills, chores etc? (Just curious how a household of 5 busy working adults manages this from a practicality perspective!) "
This makes my blood boil. 
"Any fears before making your life changes or was it ""just go with it"" attitude?"
FYI you’re wrong. 
I do not have a plan and I'm going to take some time to not even think about it before I start brainstorming. I have enough emergency money saved to last me about 10 months. My poop goal is to have awesome healthy poops as much as possible. 
The only person that can sign me up is my Operations Manager and she's at lunch. 
"Lmao, hold a pork chop there to lure it out and smack it with the chicken leg to stun it"
I don't understand how any of this is asexual
"Most of my family was on my side throughout everything.  I think my sister told my aunt and uncle something because no one has heard from them since, but otherwise everyone has been supportive through everything.  

My sister made false claims to the Department of Social Services against my other sister that resulted in my nephew being taken away about ten years ago.  At that time my sister had offered to babysit him so my other sister could go out of town, then immediately called and said he was abandoned etc.  She did this after a huge fight with my other sister, so again, a retaliation move.  

Then there were incidents with my mother and sister where my sister called police claiming my mom assaulted her because my mom refused to give her money.  "
I want everything to be amicable. 
"There are a few reasons, but the primary one is that people will hurt their case without knowing it. The police seldom ask the ultimate question (did you do it?) until the very end of the interview. The majority of the interview will be questions that are designed to confirm the background details. People will answer without realizing that they are confirming part of the story.

There are also issues with putting the accused on the stand now, because they have just given a statement that they can later be impeached with.

Finally, anything you say becomes part of the theme of the case. I might see better ways to win, but now I'm locked into the statements that you made. I can't change those statements, so my flexability becomes limited.

If you're bored and really want to be terrified, you should look up the Reid method of interrogation. That is pretty standard practice throughout the United States. "
"He is married, so his wife is kind of like a head wife and we are girlfriends (we use the term concubine it sounds sexier) This is a mix of real life and fantasy, we know it can't last forever, but I'll be in it for as long as they are."
Damn good choice
"It's fine guys, Don't worry she is cool  "
"You don’t flirt or kiss passionately? It just seems such a huge gap, even without the act itself. Slaps on the bum, neck nibbles, a quick squeeze. I feel bad for you, although thats probably wrong of me."
"Osteogenesis Imperfecta in layman terms is brittle bone disease. My son has a defect in his collagen and so it causes him to fracture extremely easily. He will have fractures his entire life unfortunately. It has slowed down a wee bit. The first year of his life he had over 80 fractures, some were from sneezing, coughing,holding a baby rattle and lots were from doing absolutely nothing. It is a very tough life. "
"Well, you certainly came *near* her mind."
"In bed mostly, sometimes all of us, sometimes some, sometimes with just two people and all sorts of combinations. "
"I had no idea planet fitness did that. I would walk right out of a gym that only accepted checking not credit, the only reason they have for doing that is making it harder to cancel. "
"We keep in touch because sometimes she’ll call or text me regarding my kids, she would drop them off to me, pick them up etc;"
"She feels stuff, but its meh to her"
Keep it in the family!

"I have thought of calling back Naomi and saying ""I WON!! HAHA!"" and then hang up but I really do not want her to uncancel my membership. "
Don't judge Naomi for how much she eats. 
"Get well soon :(. 

How do you think it got in?"
"""dear kids, your grandma ate my dick once"""
I don't have a phone
"I was pretty a-symptomatic, just a little tired and had a bigger appetite without gaining weight, so it went pretty unnoticed. 

Honestly, the only bad symptom I had was my ass itched all the time. I thought it was because my underwear was too tight? Nope, tapeworm. 

It’s probably not a symptom, but part of the worm coming out of me was for sure the most awful part of this entire thing."
"He feels every fracture like we do so yes he feels alot of pain unfortunately. We have to have pain meds with us at all times, but he isnt on pain medication constantly, just the first few days after a fracture or surgery. But he never complains and he often tries to hide fractures until he can't anymore. He just had rodding surgery on his femur and tibia Tuesday, which included cutting the bone right across so they could insert the rod into the bone where it was curved and he rated the pain a 8 out of 10. He has never said he has had a 10/10 because his pain tolerance is insane. "
"$3800 a month for rent.  


Subtract 300 for the breakfast, 130 for Internet and cable  


$10 for washing towels.  


$100 for electricity.  


$100 for other utilities and expenses.  


That's still $3200 a month - you can rent a nice place for a lot less than that."
"Upvote for ""gnarly"""
I shouldn't have to pay to cancel a membership though! That is ridiculous.
I actually just started going to a personal trainer instead! Its so much worse!!!
