My wife and I had an argument and she got in her car to 'go somewhere and cool off'. She crashed and died. That's the one moment I regret not saying sorry and calming her down.

Never put all your eggs in one basket skills-wise. There are two ways to nearly assure that you'll succeed in life: 1) become the absolute best at one thing, and make everyone reliant on your talent at that one thing 2) become above-average in various skills that interest you, giving yourself a unique combination of skills that nobody else can duplicate. Since you're unique, you're valuable.

Statistically speaking, you and I are never going to be *the best* at any one skill- not the greatest athlete, or investor, or artist, or whatever. So that leaves option 2. Basically, find anywhere from 3 to 7 skills you're interested in learning and become at-least above-average in them. This'll allow you to be a unique entity."

"Glad you do this...I think.

I say that because **as long as** no innocent people get caught in the cross-fire.

In Canada, some group called [Creep Catchers](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=creep+catchers+innocent+dead&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=videos) have fucked up some innocent lives over their careless vigilantism.

Be well and be careful with this hobby."
"So he told me six years ago. I have consistently been in therapy (2 to 4 sessions per month, depending on my state of mind) since our separation and divorce. I don’t remember exactly when - it started as an “absolutely not” and moved to “wait, maybe” then full on acceptance - “fuck. I can’t believe I did that.” I just apologized to him this week for it. It took six years of deep soul searching to realize how fucked up I was. 

I have all the reasons WHY, but none of that matters: what matters is my ex spouse felt abused and his feelings are valid regardless of what I think or my reasons."

"Not really. Teenagers were disobedient in the 60s, and they're the same now."
"I don't exactly know how ""normal"" attachments work but I can try.

People without ASPD naturally want to help and protect their family and improve their lives. I imagine they are emotionally drawn towards comforting someone who's suffering. Likewise, that person actually *wants* to hear about their problems and are happy for other people's successes.

For me, these actions are forced. I know how I *should* feel, so I act accordingly. I care about my family because I know they care about me. I don't know what it's like to care about somebody so much that you would give yourself up to help them, but I know that my family loves me in this way and for that I admire them and I feel that I owe them my respect. I would get angry if anyone hurt them, because my family doesn't deserve it. I have thought up of ways of getting back on such people. But I'm not emotionally invested enough to actually want to listen to my family's problems if I can't do anything about them. However, I know that me showing interest in their struggles really matters to them, so I do it. I know I should be proud of them when they do something great, so I congratulate them. 

I suppose I'm much more detached from my family than the average person, which means I could cut ties with them very, very easily. But as long as they care about me I feel obligated to care for them back. And I'm fine with that. In fact, I wish I could feel more towards them, but I can't. I don't know why people would care so much about a single person, but I know that for one reason or another, the people who care about me are good people. I hope this made sense."
"Pay your age was an event where bonus club members could come to the workshop (on one particular day) and make any bear they wanted. The price would correlate to the age of the child who built the bear. Unfortunately mommy blogs picked up on this event and the news caught wind and people signed up for the club the day of. Across the United States lines so long they circled the malls formed. Fights broke out, the police were called, and all the stores ended up shutting down early.  I recall hearing a story from one workshop that said people were pushing strollers away from parents and threatening to drop kids off of second story railings. 

It was supposed to be a celebration of the “pay your age birthday bear” launch. Instead, it turned into a huge scandal and controversy that really negatively impacted the company as a whole, but mostly the bear builders."

"That’s a difficult one! The parents tend to be to way worse than the kids. One little girl in particular once gave me a horrible ear ache. This little girl maybe about 7 y/o comes running into the workshop and drags half the bears off the wall and rips apart all our bins. She cries when her mom says she can only have one (she ended up with 3) and when she had to wait in line would not stop yelling about how she’s been wait FOREVER! The little girl convinces her mom to get her a sound, heart beat, and smell in each bear. Each was accomplished by crying and screaming her eyes out. While doing her heart ceremony she said it was stupid and workshop was very stupid and only stupid people go here. She rolled her eyes when I tried to ask her questions. She told me to “shut up and stuff the bears”, and “stuff quicker!” Her mom let her get away with everything. Eventually she went to go dress her bears and at one point she was literally laying on the floor screaming and pounding her hands and feet. She fully dressed all her bears too and got a whole bunch of play toys. Her total racked up to more than 400$. No one said anything about her screaming and put up with it because she was a big ticket."

Before that experience I had only done acid one time in my life when I was in high school. Matter of fact, I took it DURING school lol. Apparently it was a weak batch or a low dose because the visuals were very minimal but colors were enhanced and I was ‘giggly’ the whole time. 

One day at the dealership I worked at, the service advisor there (I use to get weed from him) came up to me and told me he got some acid. I told him I wasn’t interested but he insisted and offered a free hit. Remembering the ‘giggly’ experience I had in high school from it, I figured why not. 

[It was one of these...](https://9gag.com/gag/ayLb0zq) 

Little did I know what was about to happen and although I didn’t do a complete 180, this experience was about to change my life...for the better...in a scary way. 

*I did the math*

I get off at 6 o’clock. 

It’ll take about an hour to kick in. 

The kids will be in bed by 8 so I can take it right at 6 o’clock, get home by 6:30, take a shower, kick it with the kiddos, tuck them in bed and enjoy a ‘giddy’ night with the wifey. 

“LMAO!” - LSD


I put it under my tongue at 5:45, assuming I’d swallow it at 6:00 and be on my way because...

*I did the math*

The warm and fuzzy faze almost kicked in instantly. The 30 minute drive home was an interesting one. It was summer time so the sun was about to start setting (usually dark by 8) and that day the wind was blowing exceptionally hard. A white hue was starting to engulf anything that moved and the “pre-depth perception distortion” was creeping up. Very stupid move on my part driving like that; underestimating how quickly this was happening. I mean after all;

*I did the math*

By the time I pulled up at my house it was climbing hard and fast. I have light green eyes but at this point they were already black so it was very obvious I was zooted. To top it off *I had the biggest grin on my face when I walked in the house. 

*I must preface this detail of the story because it’s a major one. 

My wife of (currently) 12 years, at that time in our lives, finally had come to the conclusion that I had become; and would remain a spiteful miserable cunt...

You see, by the time I was 17 I started helping my parents with money because my dad’s businesses had gone down. He simply tried helping too many people too quickly and it broke him. My dad had told me about how he was a transient vendor when he first got to this country. It’s really simple: find a street corner, set up shop with clothes, shoes etc and make some money. 

He got me a cargo van and I would do it after school and on weekends and made very good money. I use to drive to school in a Chester molester van filled to the brim with merchandise and some days I’d say fuck it, skip school and go set up shop. The money was great. I was profiting about $2,000 tax free *a* *week*! I ended up skipping 52 days my senior year in high school and barely graduated by going to summer school (I’m class of 2002 &amp; 1/4)

I would keep maybe $100 of that after my expenses. I felt a sense of pride every time I’d hand my parents big wads if cash on a daily basis. Despite all the things they put me through growing up amongst 4 brothers and 2 sisters, I stood by their side and I had become “the golden child”. My brothers did their own thing and other than my older brother, they didn’t care to help. Eventually my older brother got fed up as well and went off his own way. It was all on me. 

*I did the math*

Mortgage - $2,000 (it was a big house and my dad bought it when he still had his businesses)

Utilities/maintenance-$1,000 give or take)

Groceries /cost of living- $2,000

That meant, just to survive I gotta make $5,000 no matter what. 

I figured I’d do it for a few years, invest in something or start a business and establish myself. As the saying goes; “We plan and God laughs”

The months turned to years. The smiles turned to tears. My “pride” of being “the golden child” withered and what replaces it was “resentment” and a realization that I was “the whipping boy”. What my parents once “appreciated” was eventually “expected”. If I wasn’t producing or bringing something to the table, I wouldn’t even get looked at. 

Hatred filled my heart though I kept doing what I could to help them. My good intentions ended up being intentions to feed them so they’ll leave me the fuck alone.  I ended up building a wall around my heart and chose not to trust anyone and certainly not befriend anyone. I slowly changed into someone I never thought I would. 

Before I knew it I was 24 and married expecting our first child. I had met my wife when I was 22 and thankfully she’d fallen in love with the man I was before I built these walls around me. She saw the Man I was on my way to be before I did a U-turn; the man I was suppose to be. She witnessed it all and tried to get me to open my eyes to see that I was being used. 

I had gotten in the car business and made really good money but I was still giving my parents pretty much half of what I made even tho I had a house, wife and child. They even resented me that I not only married a non Arab woman/relative of mine, but also because I couldn’t give them as much as I use to. It was insane how quickly I went from “golden child” to “lying, greedy piece of shit who dishonored his family”.

And still, I kept giving! It strained my marriage, my home life, my psyche and my sense of worth. I felt like I had ran the marathon of my life and expended every single ounce of energy I had to “give it my all”,  to reach the finish line and fall down from exhaustion only to look up and see my parents looking at me like “is that all you got?”

I became a zombie. I honestly can’t decipher what happened in what year or anything. Everything became a blur. The years passed like days and I became a cold, bitter human being. 

I never smiled anymore...

Ok back to te LSD trip. 

My wife seeing me grinning ear to ear when I walked in was strange enough for her, but when she saw my eyes she goes, “what the hell did you take?”

*I did the math*

If it’s only been about 30 minutes and I’m feeling as if the universe is calling me right now, in about 3 hours someone or something inside of me is about to answer. 

I told her there wasn’t much time to explain and that I didn’t know what was about to happen with me. I told her to take the kids to bed right now and come downstairs. 

At this point it was about 7:00 and she went upstairs to get them ready for bed (yes an hour early; poor kids). I was sitting outside just staring at our neighbors’ horses across the street and the visual still gives me goosebumps. The “white hue” became thicker and engulfed everything. The wind was blowing and their manes looked as if they were disintegrating into the air.  I hadn’t realized how majestic horses truly are and it was a sight to behold. I was rapidly climbing to the peak and I felt the life of the earth embracing me and reassuring me that it’s ok to be scared and that it’s something I need to witness. 

My wife came back out around 7:45 with hot tea and wide eyes wondering what the hell is going on. The sun was finally setting and the awe of it all started taking a dark but necessary turn. 

I just started talking. Then the talking turned into laughter. Then the laughter turned into crying. 

It was finally dark outside. 

It represented the darkness that had consumed my soul.

 It was revealing the truth. 

I was finally at the summit. 

My conscious awaited me there. 

It was showing me what I need to see with a tangible visual. It answered questions for me that I didn’t ask. It was revealing to me who I had become, how I became that way and what I needed to do to fix it. It showed me what I needed to see. 

All without words. Only energy. 

Before I even realized it I was crying like a little child. I’m talking the hyperventilating and snots and all that shit. I was squeezing my wife’s hand professing how much I loved her. How sorry I was. How much she and the kids meant to me. I just couldn’t believe it; I finally felt the shame I was suppose to have felt long ago. I finally felt the guilt of putting them on the back burner and totally disregarding their happiness, well being and future. I finally felt the sadness and resentment of letting so much time slip away. 

*I finally felt*

It made me remember that I won’t live forever and at that very moment, as I astroplaned  through he cosmos of my mind; the possibility of death became real. It was scary but also liberating. I almost began to panic, breathing heavily squeezing my wife’s hand so hard that it hurt her as I travelled a million miles through my thoughts. 

Every wall I built around me to “protect myself” from ever being taking advantage of finally cams crashing down; one by one at light speed and I was the wrecking ball. 

Finally I felt weightless. I felt all the anger dissolving from physical and spiritual body. I kept grabbing my chest so much that my wife asked if I was having a heart attack. 

All I could say was “no, my heart is attacking the demons.”

The real reason was because I finally could breathe. I finally felt the weight I’ve had in my chest for years finally fall off. I felt reborn. I felt like I walked through a door and I literally kept telling my wife “I can’t go back through that door”, over and over again. 

It didn’t allow me to lie to myself. It revealed the truth to me. It even showed me that even though my parents had done me wrong on so many levels, I understood what made them that way. The struggle changed people. I no longer carried that resentment towards them but I also was no longer going to put my family on the back burner. They were priority."
"I don’t do anything to him now - we’re divorced. 

But I would keep heckin close tabs on his whereabouts. 
I’d show up to his office to “make sure” he was there (he DID cheat on me repeatedly, and he did gaslight me, but I should have just cut him loose knead of quasi-stalking). 
I’d demand his passwords to Facebook, Insta, etc. 
I would ask to go through his phone, although I never actually did. 
I’d scream and yell if things weren’t done perfectly (either at him or at myself). 
I manipulated situations to make him feel terrible about his choices. 
He would go out with friends; I’d find a sitter and “accidentally” show up where he was. 
I gave him a curfew. 
I (unsuccessfully) tried to keep his schedule to a minimum 
I held our finances hostage."

"The short answer is that he said he need help with getting a car fixed and he just generally looked like he wasn't in a good way, also there was a wife and kids involved. I'd been in a similar situation years ago and had to rely on others (Though, family members in my case, not strangers) there too so I wanted to pay it forward. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't even really start to worry about it until after he ran off with the money before we made it to the shop and I realized I never actually got to see the car or the family I was helping."

"Part of me wants to try and spin this in a way that makes me seem a little less braindead but here we go. Very long post ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was going into work yesterday I ran into this guy in the parking lot who didn't look like he was having a good time of it. Sweating, crying, the whole 9 yards. There are a lot of homeless and very poor who like to hang out in the area because it's near an over pass where they like to sleep and panhandle. I try to help out sometimes when I can, because the golden rule and all that, but it's usually small things like buying groceries or spotting a few bucks for a bus or a room for the night. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, I end up walking up to this guy and asking what his whole deal is. He tells me he was in a car accident, but in hind site never really goes into detail, instead explaining that his wife and kids are involved, which credit where credit is due was the point  where I just had to help him. So I excuse myself from work (I'm close with my boss, and the store is never really busy so thankfully I didn't get into any trouble on that end.) and we hop in my car and head off to what I thought was just a short trip over to a gas station. 

&amp;#x200B;

Instead we end up driving on the highway for a while and we get to talking about all sorts of stuff, the city, music, how sad it is that people don't help each other anymore (he brought this one up), and of course his family and financial situation. He explains that he needs to get about his tires fixed but that he's not sure he'll be able to get it fixed since he won't get his check for a few weeks and he can't pay for food, and he won't be able to get to work without it, and so on and so forth. I know nothing about cars other than that they're expensive to get fixed So I ask him how much, and again in hindsight this is where the whole thing starts to change. We end up stopping by the bank, and we start off at the low-low price of $500 for the car, but you know if he could just have a little more, he'd be able to feed his family too and of course he'd pay me back as soon as possible, and he even offered to give me his wedding ring as collateral. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still feel sorry for the guy so I tell him not even to worry about it, and I give him $500 from the bank and toss him an extra $140 I had in my wallet just to make sure his kids get to eat. At this point he's eternally grateful, he has me write down my name and number so he can get into contact with me to make sure he finds out how to repay me and I am absolutely convinced that I am doing the right thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

We drive up the road for another 15 minutes or so to roughly the place where the mechanic shop is supposed  to be but I have to stop at a gas station because I'm running low. Conveniently the shop just happens to be a little further from here and he knows just how bad I need to get to work so he tells me he's just gonna hoof it from here. Admittedly this didn't feel right even at the time but I'm a doormat so I didn't say anything. I spent the rest of the day thinking about it and really tried to convince myself that it wasn't that weird. 

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't until this morning that it really dawned on me just how funny it was that I never got to see either the car or the family I was supposedly going through all that trouble for. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can honestly say I've never felt that stupid or angry before."
Lmao I love you.
The acid trip is a long story and I’m about to head home from work. I will resume answering questions when I get home but to put it in the most simple humanly terms possible: I met my conscious that night and it answered questions for me that I didn’t ask but subconsciously needed answers to.
"1) Yep, the main technique is the ""Memory Palace"". The human brain is naturally good at remembering locations/spatial recognition, so assigning abstract information in these locations helps you retain them. I just learned it through the internet/books. I suggest you give it a try!  
2) Nope. I'm not a savant in any way. Memorizing is 99% a skill. I trained a lot to convert abstract information into images that my brain can remember easily. My skill arose from practice alone.   
3) In school, it helps if there are stuff that I need to cram. If, for example, I have a biology exam the next day, it's  2nd nature for me to memorize terms like what I do in competitions."

"I'm still trying to piece it together, but I've figured out a few things. I remember that when I was a child, cheap thrills would scare the living hell out of me, more than the average person my age, so I wasn't born like this. But once I hit puberty I had my first of many bouts of depression that I still have today. This was when my desensitisation began. My dad developed anger issues and had frequent violent outbursts, so I became desensitised to fear because nobody else in my family could. I snatched a knife from his hands once. Cheap thrills such as horror films and roller coasters no longer did a thing to me. Then my parents got verbally and psychologically abusive, they would taunt me and yell and pound at my door for days at a time. This went on for years. My sister never helped, and I had almost no friends at the time. I remember my parents' words used to hurt me so much. Until eventually, they didn't."

"Salam to you! Yeah LSD was a god send for me. I try to keep it as a quarterly “cleansing”. It’s like years of therapy in one session so every 3 months usually works out great for me. 

I’m not the type to say “everyone should try it once”. It can bring forth some major inner demons and have you questioning your sanity. I’ve had 2 scary experiences but was able to gain control of them eventually (music is a big tool in doing this; Tool, the band is fucking incredible to be specific). 

What still kind of hurts me is that, in some weird way, I know my parents “meant well” and tried their best with what they had to work with. 

-They grew up in the old country

-They immigrated to pursue the “American Dream”

-They had hoped to give us a better life here in America yet still have us adhering to the “old country” cultural ways. 

-They anticipated having children that, like them; would follow them blindly and without question or resistance. 

-They began by lecturing us about “our culture”. 

-They saw that that wasn’t working so then they would blatantly lie to try and brainwash into falling in line. 

-They realized that didn’t work so they tried to do it by force. 

This backfired because 

-We didn’t grow up in the old country. 

-We were born in a country and a culture they told us “wasn’t ours” and forbade us to partake in it while also lecturing us on “our country” in which we had never been before. It was confusing to say the least. One of those “look but don’t touch; smell but don’t taste” scenarios but instead of a simple, hypothetical ‘scenario’, it was every day life. No friends at the house. No sleeping over friends’ houses. No girlfriends etc. 

-Thankfully our oldest brother was an integral part in our “free thinking” because he noped the fuck outta everything they tried to do. Unfortunately, me being the second oldest boy, they went extra hard on me because they realized he was a lost cause and their frustration only added to their intensity on me. 

-My brother took the “party like an animal”  rebellion route to stick it to my parents. I chose the “read and learn some shit to contradict what they’re telling me” and “smoke a lot of weed and hang out in the back seat of my car with my (ex) girlfriend” route. 

-The ass kickings only sped up and power upped said rebellions. Younger brother followed suit. “Rebels without Allah”!

Whats your favorite color?
Biggest regret in life?
"Damn I didn’t realize how long this post is and I’ll elaborate more later. My wife is already looking at me like “WTF?” because I’m suppose to be helping her make cookies right now. 

I’ll end it with this; I’ve had about 40 different LSD trips since that day and each time I take something away from it. I’ve became a much better husband, father and son (well, kinda lol) but that first trip was something I’ll never forget but barely remember. 

PS~ Trippers beware; even though it all makes sense to you at that moment your at the peak; someone listening just sees a rambling madman. 

Cheers folks."
"He claimed, and I don’t remember tbh, that he only cheated because I was emotionally abusive. 🤷🏻‍♀️ That’s between him and his conscious. His wrongs didn’t give me a free pass on my wrongs. I was hella controlling; ultimately that’s what I mean by emotionally abusive."
😐

I feel you bro. Good on you for breaking the cycle!
"Does food names taste like the actual food?

It would be pretty confusing tasting the word ""Strawberry"" and have it taste like bananas"
"I’m a glazier, install glass in them big Skyrises if you didn’t know lol, well soon anyway"

Perfect reply
"After seeing your answer, I'm not sure if ""Describe your perfect woman"" is the original or edited question."
Well that wouldn't be the forst time I heard that sentence. Lol. Thanks for asking.
Those are ***ROOKIE NUMBERS***
"I grew up in a house that had a massive garden surrounded by a forest. I used to like going to the forest. They called me ""the forest girl"". I liked to yell and hear my echo...but as far as monarchy or communism, I remember the picture of King Michael at school. We liked looking at his picture in the morning, all the girls liked him because he was very young and handsome.  
As for a comparison, let's say the system has changed, but the scoundrels stayed the same."

What does Kim taste like?
"Oh man, I can't imagine how heavily this must weigh on you.

I am so very sorry."
"in one word, what's the feeling you have for you mother"
Probably convincing you that you are doing all the work while I up-sell you on expensive things to go inside an expensive bear

Thanks Uncle Ben

"I’ll give the company credit when it comes to this, the bears (when made right) are extremely high quality. We get many people who come in with bears they made in the early 2000s that are still put together. Some sounds still work after a couple years, I don’t know about heart beats. Most impressively I can attest to the fact that he scents you can put in last a life time. That being said, if a bear builder doesn’t do their job right the bears will fall apart easily. The strings need to be pulled and tied very tightly otherwise they will bust open (though we will re-sew any BAB that comes into the shop). We do get a lot of defective bears with holes in them or weak seams but a good bear builder always checks the seams before giving the bear back to a child."
Must be Italian...
Sorry to be the guy that asks this question. Are you afraid of death?
How awesome would it be if he actually ends up calling you to pay you back
"Well, I believe card counting really only involves math, but yeah I guess it helps in card games haha."

"Any advice for a late 20 something early 30 something adult, any advice you would have told your younger self and really emphasized"
"Back in 2002 or 2003, my 12 yo daughter was “caught” with her top off in the middle of the night, in front of the computer, by my then bf.  He continues to say she was seducing someone and harbors resentment toward her to this day.  This was before “online predators” were a thing.  She was a victim of some pervert somewhere.  I thank you from the bottom of my heart."
You've never been to a Disney park have you?
This is hilarious.
"Hey! I had a friend who was diagnosed with ASPD. He had some issues with empathy, of course, which in this case, his main issue stemming from this was dealing with authority figures and holding down a job. While his attachments to friends and family maybe weren’t the same as a normal person, he made it out to be more of a bond based on loyalty. He didn’t have much of either, but the loved ones he did keep in his life, he had their back."
"I don’t know if I would call it weird but I once saw a man with a rainbow dash bear pick out a fedora, lightsaber, tutu, panties, and captain America shirt"
You’re like ultimate at card counting huh?
My name sounds delicious hahaha
"Thank you and we agree; we're lucky to have the space and resources to make it work - it isn't for everyone also! We've showered at 63 individual places so far, from family and friends to truck stops to our foot pump shower near a river. Truck stops tend to be the nicest on the road but the most expensive at $10-15 a pop. The worst was honestly a bachelor guy friend's seemingly never-cleaned shower 😂. In Baker, Nevada we showered at an old gas station with two stalls marked 'honor system, $2'. Shower shoes and biodegradable soap are always a must."
How was the acid trip? How much did you take? What’s the backstory to them wanting you marry your cousin?
Knew it! Life would be so much simpler if that was still the case.
"Thanks for answering! I’m glad you think so, haha."

Glad to surprise you
Sure would.
"I graduated high school in 17, and didn’t want to go to college and needed to do something with my life. So I knew someone who was in that trade and found it really interesting, so I just talked to him about it and whatnot and it all kinda just panned out."
Are you ok?
"How do you feel about the adults who come in for bears? My husband got me the BAB Toothless as a birthday present years ago, and I treasure him, but I feel a little awkward in Build-A-Bear as an adult without a kiddo."
What is your favourite animal?
"Who did they murder?

Was the friend romantically involved with your mother?"
Ye that's the hardest part of me is that I cant just go do what I used to be able to
"I really want to believe he will, but I'm not willing to bet on it. He said he would call me when the car got fixed."
It's been a long road but I think I'm coming out the other end. I just wish it hadn't taken so long to recover. I now have no idea how to get a career on the go.
Well so is the bride.. but each to their own
"I am so sorry--I have been there. It will get better, I promise. 

To give you some context, 10 years ago,I had an amazing job I loved making $85,000/year, owned a house and was married at that time for a little over 10 years. I had a long term heroin addiction that I eventually beat. I thought things were looking up..but within a year (2012-2013), my daughter was in a near fatal car accident, I lost my job,  my house went into foreclosure,  and my husband of nearly 16 years, had a mid-life crisis of sorts, and left without warning. 

Omg, I was 42 and thought I,was way too old to put a life together again.

It is now 6 years later. I moved to Florida from Philadelphia almost immediately after my ex left. My daughter,  who had some brain injury, and a ton of physical ones, is nearly fully recovered-she is now 24, works full-time, goes to school full-time and is getting ready to move to Vancouver Washington. I have yet to reach the level of professional success I had before, but I love my life. I wake up happy every day. I have an amazing spouse, who is better for me than my ex ever was, we share a lovely home and I just love my life now...much more than I ever enjoyed my past. 

So sometimes stuff happens because you need a change,  and you don't even realize it. Or perhaps all the bad luck can be a catalyst for you to make big changes - just know you probably aren't and haven't lived your best life yet...give yourself the opportunity to create a new and better one. 

I was convinced my life couldn't get better at my age and because I lost so much..but losing everything allowed me to pick my new starting point!

Think about what your next steps should be.  I always wanted to live in a warm climate and I wanted to start fresh.  That was the first decision that set me on the path I am on today.

Take a little time and figure out your new starting point and try to enjoy the journey!!!"
Everybody ask your name and she’ll tell you what your taste is!!!

"Groom is older, in his 50s. Bride is in her 20s. I met the bride in college."
"I'm sorry that this happened to you.  As a father of two daughters, sexual assault is something that I worry about..... Looking back over my life (here in the Silicon Valley) I can say that I had many different ""life dreams"" growing up.  When I was in high school, my dream was getting into college, when I was in college, my dream was getting out of college and getting a job.  When I was working, my dream was to get a job that allowed me to move out of my parent's house.  You are now 10 years older and 10 years removed from your 23 year old self.  You lived your 23-year old dream back then.  Ask yourself what your 33-year-old self dreams of.   What kind of success do you want?  What job do you want. If coding still calls to you, then pull yourself back in.  Start networking, look at current skill set requirements, etc.   On the other hand, perhaps your 33 year old dream is something other than coding.  Jobs are often just a means to secure rent and food.  You're teaching pottery now.  Is there another job that could be more enjoyable  for you than teaching pottery and  that pays better?"
Idk ask your Mom.
OP got taken this time.
Fancy yourself a chance with the groomsmen/bridesmaids?
How rich is he?
We listen mostly to music and podcasts; haven't dug in to audiobooks as much but should! WTF podcast with Marc Maron and Stuff You Should Know are our go-to's.

No problem
That's terrible. I hope you can bounce back as soon as possible.
"I don't enjoy being that guy, but i'll bite the bullet this time. That situation is not a catch-22, sorry."
Vroooooom
"I would like a relationship, but I don't think I'd be able to have one properly. I've tried in the past, but once I got over the initial thrill of the new experience, I lose interest pretty quickly. I hope that was just because I haven't met the right person, but I fear that I won't ever be able to provide the affection a romantic partner deserves."
Are your parents related?
Was this forced on your siblings as well? Did any of them end up marrying someone related to them?
Lol nooo I am much younger than all of the groomsmen
"The company had to hand out vouchers for people waiting in line. Eventually people started running to the back of the line to get more and more. Bear builders were harassed for weeks by parents who chose to wait in the lines as if it were our fault. We turned over half our staff (because people quit on the spot) and bear builders would have to go into the back room to cry and have anxiety attacks frequently for several weeks as the voucher were still circulating. The company put a gag order out on the event. In training to this day they teach us that if the topic is brought up, all we should say is something along the lines of “yeah a lot of friends wanted to come build bears, we’re so glad you came to visit us today, what are you celebrating” (or something along those lines). My workshop has remained understaffed ever since."
How many people have you dated?
"Sort of. I was a huge supporter of the 2nd wave. Third wave is more complicated, and I think the 'wage gap' is a much more complex subject than many feminists give it credit for. 

My viewpoint has always been very moderate, leaning liberal socially. Even back in the day, I was pretty okay with LGBT people and minorities. But in voting, I'd say I switch back and forth a lot 

Here's my voting record:

- Johnson in 64

- Nixon in 68 and 72

- Carter in 76

- Reagan in 80 &amp; 84

- HW Bush in 88

- Bill Clinton in 92 &amp; 96

- Al Gore in 2000

- Kerry in 2004

- Obama in 2008 and 2012

- And didn't vote in 2016"
Because there is one of these every day
"I thought about suicide every day from about age 13 to 25.  Only  was hospitalized after each of my 3 attempts.  I felt like psych hospitals were complete horse shit, a total scam.  They never helped me at all, they just made me feel worse for being scammed and used.  What do you think of 'the system'?"
"Never counted, but around 10 maybe"
What is your job?
I was going to ask about kumquats ...
