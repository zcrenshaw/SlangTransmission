they scare me when i'm driving
My bio mom was 34 and he was 13. It was not romantic and she did go to prison over it.
What is your opinion on potholes in the road?
"The boss is a former Marine and that is probably his version of Live, Laugh, Love."
How old are you?
What is something small and gross?
Do you guys ever go to Costco?
I’ve worked in a place like this before. If you’re not early you’re late.
"Depends on the American to be honest. I think there's a hell of a lot of misinformation spread about Arabs, I feel Iraq in particular is known for war and war only. Many people think of us as backwards, uneducated people, which.. my mother and my 3 aunts are all engineers. My grandad was a lawyer. We are educated, civilised people, and it frustrates me that this is surprising so some."
white but there's a fuzzy blue cover on it
the pimple on my forehead
21!
Who is your least favourite dictator?
i honestly don't have one. i don't think about them much
i didn't hear about that! that's awful. what a shit person.
What color is your toilet?
"not right now. i think i want some in the future, but not for a couple of years!!"
Plot twist: the question hasn't been edited.
"Damn.  Your brother wasn't old enough to be a father at 14, so your parents raised you.  Where is the mother and how is she not in jail?"
"FREE. It took seven months and three tries and a lawyer’s help and also a photo ID for me to get my name removed from the records of Mormon, Inc (even though none of that was required for me to join!) and I recently received confirmation that they finally removed my name on June 21st (Summer Solstice!), so I am a very happy woman now.

Thank you for asking! :)"
Tou have kids?
"What do you think about that woman who pushed that old man off the bus, which later killed him?"
i don't know but i am as well for some reason
"I think sometimes you meet someone and you see the great side of them, and they see that in you, and you overlook your differences. Then enough time passes and you learn to love so much about each other, but then those differences surface again, and this time you love each other far more...which makes the fear of losing the other one even more unbearable to think about.   Eventually, those differences surface and you must acknowledge that maybe you just aren't all that happy together. Once you bring that emotion to light, there is no going back."
you :)
Why am I wide awake at 325am EST?
"If you could have dinner with anyone, dead or alive, who?"
Thats fucking heavy.
Some older woman who lived in the neighborhood. Apparently she was banging a lot of the high school kids and she raped my brother when he was in the 7th grade after getting him high.
"I had known about the rumor for awhile, but I saw my birth certificate when I was 17."
Next time be 20 minutes late
this is so hard!!! pad thai maybe. i like all kinds of noodles
"High-demands cults like Mormonism, JWs, and Scientologists, they don't just \*let\* you stop attending. They hound you and stalk you and pester you FOR LIFE. Even if you move away, they hunt you down online and send more church people to your door, call you, email you, send stuff in the mail. And with me, I have a spouse that goes and kids to consider, so I wanted a clean break. 

Also I wanted to talk about the abuse I suffered in Mormonism, and as a full-fledged member I could be publicly excommunicated for speaking out against Mormon leaders--it is very important for me to leave on my own terms and not let them have that power over me, and the only way to do so was by getting my name removed from their records, first. I had no idea, however, how HARD that would be, wowsa"
19 and I was 17 and I was disappointed but felt bad for my brother/dad
"TBH, they weren't much older than my friends' parents who were like 40 when they had their first kid."
What’s your favorite food?
I still see him as my brother. He actually is a teacher and I go to college.
probably arms. i could live without legs i think
"I'm asian...

I'm sorry, I tried not to scare people but unfortunately I failed.

Is this excusable."
"Then it makes sense to him and his world. 

I've worked on international projects and the Germans were sitting ready for meetings at 9am easily 10mins before starting, just getting everything ready. Due to the formal atmosphere I was also certain not to give any bad vibes. 

At 9am some of the brits could enter the conference room talking and going over to the little table with biscuits to accompany the tea they were making ready.  

I'm used to or open for both, I preferred the UK style, but with limited time we'd all of course benefit not wasting 5-15 minutes just to get everybody to sit down. I'm Norwegian, we have really laxed business environments, not much of a hierarchy to speak of either. 

Your boss sounds like he wants to keep the world he's used to and that means no room for error, or errors are even an insult to him. Does not sound like my dream job, but just being on time is all he asks, and probably to be at your desk working as the clock passes 8.00am."
Thank you for realizing he was raped by that pedophile and I’m glad his parents wanted to take care of you as their own child.  I’m glad you grew up with people that love you.
Yep Helter Skelter and Sgt. Pepper. Unfortunately he didn’t sing anything but it was still indescribable to see these two men with their shared history performing together live.
"Wow, that's a little messed up to be honest with you."
"Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity, to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment, would you capture it? Or just let it slip?"
Smart and Final.
Grandparents.
what is your favorite limb?
How are you feeling today?
"I have no question, just want to let you know that I love this idea"
"Wow, I was 31 when my oldest was 14. That really puts it in perspective for me. That is just... unthinkable, in my mind. I am glad you are here, though."
"I've been this boss. Happened because of how I was raised - very timely parents. I was also new to supervising. Learned I was really hurting the team by being nitpicky, and adjusted.

In some situations, it doesn't work to be a minute late, like jobs where an important task starts at 8am but needs 15mins of prep. I learned to schedule people at 7:45am, and if they came late but were still ready at 8....whatever."
"I was born in Oklahoma. Went to California in 1998, and was asked if we still rode horses and chased Indians. Misunderstanding culture is a human trait. The antidote is travel. I’ve been all over Europe and few of my American friends can truly relate to the experiences I’ve had there. smh"
Last resort by papa roach was playing.
"You know I get asked that a LOT and I can't find one! There were a thousand tiny cracks in the dam. The abuse I experienced as a child...the abuse coverup I witnessed as an adult...the way I was treated my entire life as a woman in a male-dominated cult...the way I watched my mother explain away the way she was treated too (even as a little girl I used to ask her about it and her answers never quite satisfied me!). I could write a book about the many, many thousands of paper cuts that led up to it, but I suppose the biggest crack of all was when Sam Young was excommunicated for launching [ProtectLDSKids.org](https://ProtectLDSKids.org), because I had been abused during the very abusive practice he was decrying. Also, the McKenna Denson abuse case was another huge crack, because the church put out a hit piece against her whie listing her rapists credentials and her abuse case was very similar to mine--very powerful male leader, nobody wants to believe the girl because her life is a train wreck (which is what happens after a girl has been abused, hello!). That is exactly why I didn't report my abuse, because I knew that nobody would believe a white trash girl versus a powerful, successful Mormon man with lots of credentials!"
"Yes and ?. 

My husband was born and raised in a town that is 99% Mormon; he was a Mormon missionary abroad like me, but wasn't abused like me so he is befuddled as to why on earth I would leave. But my childhood abuse made me bold enough to investigate Mormon history (which Mormon leaders tell us to NEVER do) and I uncovered the century of child-rape by Mormonism's founders which, as a child sex abuse survivor myself, I cannot support. But Mormon leaders tell their followers to never read such things because they ""will lead you astray"" and are inspired by the devil. My husband, bless him, thinks I was led astray by the devil. He won't read the stuff I read because he thinks it is evil and will infect him with a bad spirit. He reports to Mormon leaders about me--like when I stopped wearing the Mormon underwear (yeah, SUPER awful having grown men talking about my undies behind my back, CRINGE)

&amp;#x200B;

I have removed my children from attending Mormon church for their own safety because of one-on-one worthiness interviews, which are one place where my abuse occurred. You can read more about them here: [https://protectldschildren.org/](https://protectldschildren.org/)

&amp;#x200B;

My kids, however, are not happy about it, because Mormonism has led them to believe that their mom is infected with a bad spirit (Satan). I can only hope they will listen and believe one day that mom did this for their own protection."
"How old are you now?

When and how did you figure out?

How did you react when you figured this out?"
"He was more like raped. It was not romantic in anyway,"
I don’t know what to say besides “Congrats!” That’s really impressive!
"Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. 

Great ending to a great movie series.  I love how Sam had a family and the actor showed how at peace he was."
He's actually pretty distant from me.
He was really strong for telling his parents. And they were freaking awesome to call the cops.
Did you ever wonder why your parents were so old?
"Without getting too negative, I will just sum up by saying this:

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine being a child sex abuse survivor.

&amp;#x200B;

Now imagine that you discover that the religion you were raised in and thought was founded by nice, godly men, was actually founded by a cult of child-rapists who fake-married 15 year-olds against their will (Joseph Smith married a 14 year old, 16 year old, and many more--some were his foster daughter/house servants, other teen girls he threatened their parents with eternal damnation if they didn't give him their daughters!). Brigham Young did the same, marrying a little 15 year-old when he was something like 47. I have young teen daughters myself, so this was a HORRIFYING discovery, but the fact that I even read this stuff makes me an evil apostate among my own people--remember, Mormon leaders preach that ""research is not the answer,"" we aren't supposed to read this stuff; we are only supposed to read books that praise Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, books written by Mormon authors.

&amp;#x200B;

Now imagine that, as a childhood sex abuse survivor, you not only discover your lifelong religion was originally a child sex abuse cult and manage to escape it, but that your spouse of 20 years refuses to listen or believe this? Not only does he worship the child-rapists who founded the cult, but he wears the underwear they invented as a secret marker of their polygamous child-raping! Every night you lay in bed beside this man and wonder: what do I do? He is the father of your children, he is a smart man with an advanced degree, but he has been so thoroughly brainwashed that he 100% believes the child rapists were godly men who saw angels and that those angels told them that raping kids is okay--or at least, when you tell your spouse that they raped kids, he thinks you are influenced by satan for believing this. What would you do? Especially if you were still raising young and teen children?

&amp;#x200B;

It is quite the dilemma."
What do you think of Americans?
Who do you consider as your parent/s?
"I just want to say that I hope your beautiful country continues to progress in security stability so that it can be the tourist destination it deserves to be - as the birthplace of civilization. I would love to visit historic sites, and experience iraqi culture-  as I am sure would people from all over the world."
So...... what was wrong?
It’s good so far. Its worth it. It’s making me more aware of my self destructive behaviour but I have miles and miles to go still.
"Do you mean they're more mature? I've noticed that among a lot of schoolkids in Iraq. They're a lot more.. I'm not sure, adult-like in the way they speak and act than my classmates and I. It must have to do with being brought up in big families (many siblings, grandparents living with them in the house, etc), or having lived tehough rough times (war). 

I learned English at school and through reading books and watching television. 

My day's going pretty alright, a but bored over the summer."
Basically an older woman raped him when he was 13. It fucked him up. He told my parents and they called the cops and she was busted for having sex with him and some high schoolers. She was pregnant and they did an DNA test after I was born and he was the dad.
It fucked my brother/dad up so no?
"So as far as how it went down for me, they all came over to my place knowing exactly what was going to happen. But I only knew 3 of the guys previously, the other 2 were friends of theirs. We hung out for a while because I did want to get to know the other 2 a little first.

As far as the main event, I got naked and let them touch me a little bit. I played a bit with myself as well for them and just generally tried to be eye candy. When they got comfortable they all got naked and basically yeah from there on it was just them stroking away and I was using both of my hands to help as much as I could. So I guess you could say there was a bit of build up. :)"
I like being used and humiliated. I really love dick too. :)
no they don't
I thought I was the only one!
Favourite film and why?
I don’t know why I snort laughed
"I don't know, really. Maybe it was taking a step back and looking at these forums from the outside looking in, and realizing how unrealistic and radical these posts are. Or maybe it was just me talking to women in online games, and realizing how normal they are. I dunno, that whole time of my life was a blur."
"Yes, but I suppose if you went deeper, the ""principle"" could be so that they don't have control over my name anymore. Though technically they never do delete it. They keep it right there because they do hope that all their members will come back. If I ever ask to rebaptize and re-do my temple rituals, they will just reactivate everything with the click of a button (ugh). Not that I ever would, not in a million years.

Even if angels came down and said to me, ""That pedophile sex cult from Joseph Smith founded in the 1800's really is God's true church!"" I would say, ""Then I'll take the hot flames of hell, thanks!"" I don't plan to spend my eternity hanging with wife-swapping rapists, nope."
"I've been visiting my mother more often, and have been playing a ton of apex with a girl I know online. I've stopped visiting incel forums/r9k and have been trying my best to stop myself from thinking self destructive, mysogynistic thoughts. I've also been more involved in the LGBTQ+ community. It's tough, but I've come a long way."
"i'll give it to ya, you got me there"
Do not do this
"How has the equation with your brother/dad changed?

What does he do?

What do you do?"
It evolved that way. My brother/bio dad was 14 when I was born and obviously was not dad material and my (grand)parents had regretted only having one kid.
When did you find out?
It was not
"Hey im F35. My dad died in December and i didnt shed a tear, hadnt seen him in 20yrs, didnt know the guy. Two weeks later i had to put my dog down and i fell apart. I still miss her derpy ass, like a physical ache in my chest. 
Allow yourself to be sad, its not a macho thing ya gotta ignore. Dogs are way more loyal than hoomans, so ofcourse its gonna be heart breaking and thats ok to feel. You will be ok!"
Perhaps I will.
"ahh the classic ""swimming pool ass"""
Did ringo play any songs with Paul and the band?
I call him by his first name.
Because you gave us permission to ask you anything..
I honestly don't know. She was older than him.
"PSA: If you adopt a child from the Texas foster system— they have free tuition &amp; fees to any public college in Texas! 

If you were ever a ward of the state of Texas— you might be eligible as well (its a more recent program so more likely to be the case for young adults)."
"I don't have much to say to them, they're pretty far gone if they're bigoted in this day and age.

I'mvery very interested in the history of the middle east, classical Arabic music, linguistics, and reading I guess. I'd like to be a psychiatrist."
Never work in Latin America. Fuck. Those guys will be 45 minutes late to their own god damned funerals.
I really hope there was some music playing in the background or something. I feel like it would be really awkward to just have no noise except the sounds of multiple people stroking it haha
"Honestly it’s mostly all the mental ptsd and what not. Everything is a little too good to be true, so every day I’m just waiting/expecting to fall apart (when in reality it would take years, not day). Aside from that, the asthma sucks too hahaha"
"At my worst point, I remember a time I had hose clamped a chefs knife to a broomstick, and wrapped myself in a bedsheet.. I was shitting my pants and throwing up from dopesick and was desperate.. I robbed a man at an ATM for his phone, wallet, and forced him to do a withdrawal.. He actually took pity on me and did so, and called his phone later to talk to me.. He proceeded to form a trusting relationship with me after leaving care packages in dead drops, so thankfully the lack of charges pressed allows me to share this."

What is your cellphone wallpaper?
Yes.
"Iraq is more chill than you would expect. The people are cool. The food is fantastic. 

The west.. hmm. Better weather, less wars, that seems nice."
How old were you when you said your first word?
one i think?
14
"I used [QuitMormon.com](https://QuitMormon.com). It is the easiest because any other way requires you to interact with church leaders, but QuitMormon is a former Mormon lawyer who interacts with Mormon leaders for you, ProBono! He is the REAL saint! :) I was so grateful that I donated money to him anyway, bless him"
I am bored. I have no problems with any question
"It is an extremely painful experience so I will try to just give an outline:

&amp;#x200B;

I witnessed a man sexually assault a child at a church activity. She was a very little girl (only five years old) and too little to speak about what happened and nobody saw it but me--I had followed the two of them because, as a sex abuse survivor myself, I thought it very inappropriate that he was going off alone with a child that wasn't his, so I quickly darted after them for a sec, just to make sure everything was okay. I was a counselor in the primary presidency (children's auxiliary at church) at the time, so I felt it was my duty to make sure one of my kids was okay. I ended up witnessing this man humping up against the little girl and then running off before I had a chance to scream or alert anybody. 

What happened after that is a nightmare I will spend the rest of my life trying to forget. It brought out the truth about how little Mormonism value women and children and how hard they work to protect the men. It was doubly painful for me because I was a childhood sex abuse survivor myself, something I made the mistake of telling the leaders at one point, which made them throw up their hands and declare I must have imagined the whole thing because of my own emotional scars--um, no! They are what made me more vigilant and alert to the predator in their midst! 

No matter how long and hard I fought to stand up for that little girl and what happened to her it didn't matter, At the end of that nightmare, this man is still a Mormon priesthood leader in good standing and I, after being disgraced, moved to a new congregation because I was a supposed liar, [as you can see](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/cdjm98/hoping_to_find_former_students_on_here_pm_me_if/) I am now a disgrace of an ex-Mormon among my people, so it is obvious how little I was believed. It was a hellish experience and the church spent months trying to silence me and get rid of me and my entire family--and they succeeded."
"Also, no.. I wouldn't say it's the closest to feeling dead, nothing feels like that except being dead.. Or being asleep and not having a dream, which is what an OD is like.. I never had a relapse either because I was high from the age of 14 until now.. The only thing pushing me really is the will to live, and get off the street.. I had an experience where a good friend of mine almost died.. I had no phone, couldn't call 911, or get to help.. My friend was going blue and dying.. I had to give him oxygen for 3 hours, vomiting from him throwing up in my mouth, until he sobered up.. That was a huge wake up call for me, it was highly emotional..   


I'm not depressed, I feel fine actually. It's weird.. I just magically lost the urge to get high any more..."
"So who did you brother /dad have sex with in order to have you? Everyone please refrain from saying "" mOm """
What's it like to be a hero
"Well, why did they get the idea that your wife is a horrible mother? And on what bases would they take your child from you?  Why do you need to kick her out? Don't want to interrogate you or anything, I'm just curious how people come to such harsh and hurtful ideas or opinions"
I'm so glad to hear she was jailed. I hope you were able to come to terms with having a piece of garbage for an egg donor.
How is the therapy going?
We don't talk but he pulled I'm an adult card when I was younger.
"So, does he make bro jokes or dad jokes?"
"Hi kid, do your parents know you use reddit..."
So your Elon Musk
I feel you. My husband and I decided to separate after almost 7 years of marriage (16 years together). Internet hugs for you.
"Very well, I'd say. All my female relatives are educated, my grandmother was the principal of a primary school way back. They're free to work (all my aunts do) and"
"I started to disagree with you, then I remembered my friend who is married to a nigerian. An engineer, mind you. People here regularly ask him what his village is from. He is from a city with close to 10m people....so maybe you are right."
"Damn, that's pretty weird. You're right, simply hearing about other cultures is not enough to truly understand them."
I wouldn’t call being raped as a kid much better though
"you kind of answered everything in that novel you wrote. coming from an ex dope addict, congratulations. my struggle with opiates started at 18 with percocet, then that became too expensive so i moved to heroin at 19 i think and i was on and off that until just over a year ago im 26 now.

when someone asks me what's it like being on heroin, after telling them straight up that it feels great, i tell them its the closest you can get to being dead. would you agree?

before every single time i relapsed i found myself basically almost having a complete breakdown. a total ""holy shit what the fuck what the fuck moment"". same for you?

to stay sober you need to have something that pushes you every day. what is your thing? 

also, i would recommend you talking to your doctor about antidepressants. i've been on them for about 6 months now and i haven't looked back. it made the floor of my emotions not as low, so evem when i get really sad and depressed it's never as much of a big deal anymore...

remember that there are millions like us. not just recovering dope addicts but people struggling with mental health issues. it's never a shame to reach out for help because it'll only make things better. i wish you the best of luck brother and i wish the sun shines for you every day."
Bio mom did time in prison and we didn't say much. Kinda knew.
Whats the nomenclature that you use for him now?
"I became an incel for a few reasons, pretty much every woman in my life has hurt me in some way, and I found it comforting being able to blame my problems on women rather than myself and my shitty mindset."
Username checks out
"What was your breaking point? What made you say ""yep, this is it""?"
my nose. i'd just get a nose job
"I heard that Iraqi children tend to grow up a lot faster than they do in the west, is that true?  


What's Iraq like?  


How do you view Israel?  


Where did you learn english?  


How's your day going?"
I just want to say I think you're brave to speak up about this. Thanks for doing it. We're all human beings. We need to get rid of the 'Us Vs Them' mindset that too easily divides us.
"Seeing people die around me that didn’t get a choice whether they were going to die or not, and the way that impacted people who didn’t even know them, let alone loved ones. I have that choice and I know there’s a cure for me, I just have to believe in it."
"If you had to choose, all your fingers turns into penises, or, your nose turns into a giant penis. Remember, they still function as real ones. What would you choose?"
"Did they all finish near the same time, or was everyone waiting on that last guy to cum?"
"I love who I know I can be, I hate the person that I am and the fact that I’m not what I want to be."
"I’m stunned by it honestly, an act of god?"
"i can't take credit, it's been done a million times. i didn't know there was a whole sub until now!! glad i could entertain though"
"Damn, well said and unfortunately relatable :/"
"Ah, I see. I'm really sorry, but I hope that you and your brother/father are able to move on from this in whatever way you need to. You don't have to treat him like a father just because he is biologically yours, you can still be brothers. I wish you guys the best of luck"
"Hmmm. I move with my vibes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Viking metal lately as lame as that sounds."
"No, there's nothing anyone could have told me.. I had to figure it out on my own, as it goes with most addicts.. And yes, I love cantaloupe. ;)"
i used to have the biggest crush on him when i was 14
"I'm an intelligent guy, I just fell through the cracks.. I was a troubled youth.. I still have done a lot of reading over the years.. I value education and knowledge. Just because I'm an addict and a punk doesn't mean I'm not an intellectual."
"I use to date a girl that I thought this same thing. Her parents are old enough to be her grandparents. I worked with her dad, Mr Johny, and he was such a great person that I could see him doing a great deed like that. Do you feel betrayed or grateful? IMO worst of all you could have been adopted, that's why I think the grandparents are heros."
Not at all.
"It's not always the best job, but somebody has to do it"
"Curiosity is good!

Everything that happened to me was all out of the blue. None of it was predicted or foreseen - it truly all was just shit luck. The doctors noticed something was weird the on my first night and I was in surgery the next day. As far as the special needs, wheelchair, etc (mentioned in the initial post)  was because of the heart surgeries, but also because of everything else (nissan fundo plication \[apologize for that spelling\], paralyzed diaphragm, inablility to keep food down, yadda yaddah). I was on breathing and feeding tubes as a kid and I wasn't expected to be taken off. I also was on the heart and lung machine during surgery for so long (minutes away from the guaranteed 'will have special needs after surgery' minute mark) and that's when the doctors were realizing I could have a pretty shit quality of life if I lived. Everyone (including the priest, docs and therapist my family was talking to), and I mean everyone, was all ready to let me pass on. My dad said no and honestly it was the best decision he ever made, cause here I am drinking a beer and typing this 22 years later. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was not born premature also. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom always said a book. I always said nah. For the first time ever, i think maybe i should write a book. Thanks for opening my eyes to that, kind stranger."

Grief isn't necessarily a bad thing. Just a couple nights ago I went to hang out with a girl and before hand we had been texting about having sex. Cant wait... But we talk for a while and ask each other questions and she is on the topic of when me and my gf at the time were heroin addicts living in a motel. Not really a happy topic. She asks what happened to her? She died I said almost crying at that point. She asks something like did she overdose? At this point tears are rolling down my face and my throat is tight and I  answer suicide. I'm trying stop the tears while I explained what drove her to that point. to It still hurts after all these years. She has her own sad stories I found out and we ended up bonding and getting very close emotionally. So I didn't get laid but I got closer to a friend. Maybe a special girl you know is waiting for you to call her. And you'll tell her you need a friend to talk to. I'm not really awake hardly bad spelling I bet. What are your two favorite cereals? And do you ever mix different cereals together for new flavor?
"No, that's why I ate mom's spaghetti."
"Wow, i read  she ""did not"" go to jail because that's what I expected to read. I had to reread it twice after reading your comment."
Too full. This was after dinner. I'm breathing deeply
"Oh yeah. I was potty trained at 2, I got my period at 10 and a half."
"Because we would leave the baby with them when we went out, and they would help out a ton. But like I said, they volunteered. We would try to step in and take care of the baby, but they would push us aside. There was no bases for taking our daughter away. It was the height of the argument and they were mad. Originally, my dad wanted me to just kick my wife out of the house, but I told him if she has to go we all go."
How much older is he?
No ones parents know they use reddit lmao
"The way that is worded, I thought you meant two of the dudes fucked each other after.  Which may have be surprising."
Why?
"In the beginning he was, but as I got older he had issues with the circumstances. I felt icky when I found out."
they serve their purpose i suppose. they're appropriately rated.
"Yes, actually, she's now a furry, living in Bombay Beach, and takes BDSM pictures with her fat neckbeard furry boyfriend. Lmao. And I think that's one question I shouldn't touch.. The whole killing people thing.. One time I threw a molotov at a trailer owned by a guy that killed a friend of mine, though.. Maybe he died? I dunno.. I just wanted to fuck up his shit."
Is your family still in the church and what is your relationship with them?
Do you know the name of the guy in a wheelchair who wrote The Theory Of Everything?
"With your husband still being a devout Mormon, do you think your marriage is in jeopardy?"
Thank you very much for the lovely words. ♡
Did they ever ask you why they held the information from you for so long?
I'm curious as to how the event starts. Is it just like everyone shows up and strips and then a bunch of dudes just start rubbing off like madmen? Or is it built up like foreplay before the main event?

"This is Reddit. Everyone is obviously working harder than their bosses who are, of course, extremely incompetent and should be fired."
"My parents believe social media is a big waste of time, although literally everyone back home is on Instagram and such (my grandmother in particular is a Facebook ADDICT). My mom doesn't let me use Instagram/Snapchat/etc. 

To be honest with you I'm not sure how they'd react knowing I'm on Reddit. I think they'd be alright with the news/learning aspect of it, like TodayILearned and those sort of subs, but the chatting-like style of AMA.. not sure how they'd react."
Tbh thats how most people probably feel.
and do you call your grandparents Mom and Dad? well if they’re still alive.
Are you Canadian too by the way?
Why'd you need to get rid of your name? Can't you just leave?
Why wait? The early bird gets the worm.
He's 3 and I see him as my nephew.
What convinced you to stop being an incel?
"Tell her to PM me! I was a Mormon missionary and I trained Mormon missionaries, too.

We taught our missionaries to seek out people going through life transitions (newly married, just experienced a death, divorce, relocation), because people in transition were more statistically prone to join new religions. Translation: they are most vulnerable to cults! If she is in a vulnerable place right now, tell her to take a breather, get on the Meetup app and try meeting people who dont have any agenda but just want friends first, because Mormonism love-bombs the heck out of you but only because they want you to join the cult. It is fake friendship. 

The minute you leave the faith you lose all of those friendships, so they were never genuine friendships to begin with. Joining a bookclub or a social justice cause or a collecting group on meetup however gives you a genuine friendship that lasts because even if you disagree about a book's quality or what kind of fundraiser to do or which stamp is worth colelcting, at the end of the day you are still friends! :)"
"No, just a good friend."
What causes you the most issues now?
"This sounds more likely to give you PTSD than build character.

How are you now?"
"Me too, man, and it rubbed off on me.. I've done a complete 180. Lol. Now I help charities and all sorts of stuff.."
I feel like there is a lot of things you left out.
what was the conversation you had with your family after you found out? what did they say about why? and what did they say about where your bio mom is?
"Actually, the thing with the Jews, even when I was a devout Mormon that one really upset me because I worked as a genealogist and I knew exactly what they were doing: sending a message to everybody the world over that Holocaust victims can't make it back to God without Mormonism's help. Major slap in the face!

Same goes for other sacred populations (Native Americans, African American slaves, victims of genocide, etc). When Mormons take their names and do these twisted rituals in their name, it sends a message to future generations: ""hey, your ancestor may have died for their beliefs/may have died under tragic circumstances, but as an FYI they will not make it to heaven without our kiddie-raping cult's help."" Now in the annals of Mormon history, all those HOlocause victims are posthumous Mormons, alongside Hitler and his cronies. So gross.

As for becoming indifferent to Mormonism, I am like-minded with Mike Rinder, on the show Scientology: The Aftermath. When his second wife said to him: ""Why don't you just stop doing this? Stop doing this show and just leave Scientology alone?"" he answered her, ""Yeah but I still have kids in there, and I did that to them! I am doing this for them because I owe it to them""

Unfortunately, that is my situation too. I have a child attending a Mormon university because I brainwashed my kids into this cult before I knew the truth about it. That is my fault--I did that to her! I owe it to her to raise awareness of how dangerous Mormonism is, and hopefully it will get back to her. I tried gently talking to her about it and she won't listen, because people who leave Mormonism are infected by the devil remember, but I will keep talking wherever and whenever I can and pray that it gets back to her somehow"
"Oh so your father was too young to be a father, so your grandparents raised both of you... His parents! Got it."
"Congrats, same for me except I'm only coming up on four years clean"
I don't trust older women.
Thanks! I think it’s pretty cool too
"Nice job recycling the same comment you used for my AMA on addiction.

From a very brief glance at your comment history, you come off as a very angry man who judges everyone else, rather than staying in your own lane and looking at your own life. I understand everyone has been though their own shit, but immigrants, drug addicts and overweight people have literally never done anything to you (if those groups have all personally wronged you in some way, you should do your own AMA because that story would be interesting as fuck). 

The prize for staying clean is serenity and peace; for the individual and their loved ones. What's the prize for laughing at people on the margins of society?  You pick the low hanging fruit. Punch up my dude, no one gets points for punching down."
If he does this at work imagine his home life.   Wow.  One minute late and dinner not ready!!!  Omg. Just shrug it off. Do whatever you have to do to follow all the rules perfectly but be happy you don’t go home with him. Enjoy the rest of your day

"Have you been late prior to this? 

In jobs that I haven't cared about, I'd usually show up bang on time, or slightly late, because in all honesty, I didn't want to be there. My boss did pick up on this, and brought it up with me in an appraisal. One of the main reasons why I didn't set foot in the door a second before my start time was because he would have asked me to start doing work before I was supposed to start.

Now, because I have a job that I care about, I try to arrive at least five minutes before my start time, although if I'm in the office, then I arrive earlier so that I can have a coffee and get my shit together."
"As someone who has ""left"" the church but not had my records removed, how do I start that process? I haven't yet because of the affect it might have on my family. My brother had his records removed years ago and it really hurt my parents. But after reading this I just want fully out, I can't have my name there anymore."
"Yeah I have a friend from Ethiopia and I asked him what it was like with all the famines. He said motherfucker we were rich in the city, no famines when you are rich in the city."
It's too easy to confuse loving someone and loving something about them.
"r/unexpectedfactorial

Also when does the next season air miss Wexler?"
"A was actually sober for a long period in slab city after my ex left me.. It was weird, you think it'd make me do more drugs.. But I think sobriety felt more like a high to me at that point than any drug, so it was kind of reverse for me.. During that period I had an experience where we saw half a persons body turn invisible.. I saw it, people who were high saw it.. It was fucking weird, no explanation.. They phased back in and that was it.. The person it happened to had no idea that it happened..  


I've also seen a very strange experimental craft there that looked kind of like the arrows in The Sims over peoples heads.. It took off so fast that it appeared to be ""stretching,"" then rubberbanded itself and shot off in to the horizon..."
How do you feel about Harry styles?
"If you work with a German, they’ll be on time or within 30s of the meeting and get offended if you are more than 3 minutes late."
That's what you think.....son.
I think my brother wished that I was aborted because it fucked him up.

"It was a 5 guys for the bukkake and as far as fucking, 2 of them did afterwards which was surprising lol"
Do you think the sequel is going to be as good as the first?
"I was scrolling through Reddit and saw an interesting looking AMA about musicians I love.

My first reaction isn’t going to be googling the set list of a gig when I could ask OP and potentially get some insight into how the performance was as well as just the names of the songs.

There’s no need for the negative vibes."
"That's the middle east. Start time is a suggestion, Finally Meet, fuck off for an 30 minutes , than have the meeting"
Its when a mommy and a daddy and a daddy and a daddy and a daddy and a daddy and a daddy and a daddy...
We don't really talk.
Upvotes for personal growth.
"Not to be an asshole, but we all get that ""you look normal"", everyone with aspergers has that happen almost daily. Not that interesting inside, or out in that conversation.

Source: I have aspergers."
What have you been doing recently to improve yourself?
So basically getting your name removed from their records means they will stop harassing you?
Futurama :)
"It interests me a lot, the way the human mind works. I'd like to help people overcome their struggles instead of suffering in silence like many do."
