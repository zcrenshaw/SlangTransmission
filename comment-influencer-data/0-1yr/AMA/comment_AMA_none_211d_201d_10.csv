Exactly! Lol.
"Regarding the update: While ""socialist"" and ""communist"" do have specific meanings the words themselves have been coopted by the ultra right to denounce those who are left of their position. They called Obama a socialist even after he bailed out the banks post 2008 housing crash. I find the whole ""democratic socialist"" label a way of leaning in to the whole ignorant name calling. ""Yeah I am a 'socialist' and if you expect the government to pave your roads then so are you."""
No no you're okay. I don't feel out of control of my body. I feel like I know everyone here. And they know me. They all agree that they are extensions of myself. And I've never heard of a kind spirit possessing someone before.
Well put
I never got the idea!!!!
"Did you think about ending it all?

Do you hate God a little because of this?

What do you think you need right now to make you feel alright now?"
Yes! I couldn't believe that this is legit happening. Orgasm after orgasm. 
"Is this based on previous experiences? If so can I look up a review on Yelp?

                  "
"Indeed. Twice actually! The next morning we ended up spooning for a while (I love cuddling) and that was really nice, but then we had to get going because we had a long drive. Bam, blue balls again! The first few runs of that day were rough, but I shook it off "
"I am completely sure I have never had any dream. And it is not I can not remember them. I remember that every time I have woken up, the last thing I always remembered as last before falling asleep was closing my eyes. 

"
The most pleasant of feelings.  Peace &amp; be wild.
"I mean you‚Äôre also advocating for capitalism and wage slavery, so... good job on being better than other liberals."
Please tell me how jealousy doesnt even seem to be one of your traits i wish that was me lol
Would you have anonymous butt sex with the Prophet Muhammad for 10 shekels?
"You think Social Democracy is the same thing as Democratic Socialism, it‚Äôs not an insult to say you‚Äôre uninformed."
did you marry again ?
what happened ?
Nope absolutely not. He really got the message that I‚Äôm not interested and he‚Äôs a smart guy. He‚Äôs not the type to waste his time wishing for something that will never happen. 
i say uncertainty and music.
Yeees :D Absolutely especially the visiualsü§î
how would you describe the pain
"Im pretty sure I have an electric drum set somewhere lol, time to make some noise!"
What if you have an android phone thats hooked up to the gmail account in order to get apps and stuff. How do you bypass that
Means to an end? What do you mean? And you'te okay!
"And lunch, apparently. And more than likely dinner."
Can I stop by after work?
Some sort of medical reason? 
"I‚Äôm not 100% sure no, especially since he was unemployed when we first got married and so he was home all day when I was at work.... hrm... you might be onto something ;-)"
I did respond to the wrong person! I‚Äôm sorry!
There needs to be a test people take before they are allowed to have children. 
"For me, the pain of labor was much worse than the c-section. My first was an unplanned, emergency c-section after 18 hours of back labor, 4 hours of pushing, 3 failed epidurals, and zero progress. Baby was positioned so each time I had a contraction, her head was pushed against my lower spine instead of towards my birth canal. And that‚Äôs exactly what it felt like. Towards the end, close to the decision to have the c-section, at contraction peaks I couldn‚Äôt see or hear anything, it was like the pain enveloped everything and I couldn‚Äôt think about or feel anything else.

I didn‚Äôt feel anything during the operations, I had a spinal so was numb below my rib cage. Afterwards, if I kept on schedule with my pain meds it just felt really sore as though I had worked out my abs too hard the day before. Moving made it hurt pretty bad the first week, coughing and sneezing were absolute agony the first few days. Like a knife stabbing me. That‚Äôs also how it felt when I tried to be ‚Äúbrave‚Äù and wean myself off the pain meds earlier than prescribed after my first c-section.

Recovery was much easier and faster the second time because it was planned, so I wasn‚Äôt also recovering from no sleep and prolonged labor. I also knew to just take the meds as prescribed, take it easy and accept help."
"I mean I could call you ignorant and it‚Äôd still be just as apt, Lib."
"26,000"
"I mean, u got some coins and you can give me gold ;D. thats how u do it.."
"Outstanding move

Seriously though, I had thoughts similar to that you've just suggested. But after a some time after I rejected that possibility."
how old are you?
How many identities do you have?
no i am not  Muhammad 
Keep this to yourself in real life.

"no idea . i don't want to know either. i hate game of thrones, very overrated for me."
What is it that you like about religion?
I've never done LSD. What happens when you take it?
Wait so where did your alters go?
"because i am not you, you are not me . i am me and you are you."
"so, what games do you like ?"
Another person with D.I.D. There's quite a few people like me as I recently found out
"How do people keep calm during their second MRI? If you weren't claustrophobic before, the first MRI will make you one. 

Bonus question, why dont they make MRIs more in CT machines form factor"
"Me too! I had to have R and L written in my hands for driving lessons. 

I also have fucking awful balance and coordination 

And every time I walk out of a shop I turn and start walking the wrong way (I.e the way I‚Äôve just come from rather than the way I should be going)

"
"Initially I had to wait 6 weeks after the c-section to have sex, after being cleared for it at my follow-up appointment. We had to take it easy since my abdominal muscles were sore for a few weeks. Once I was healed, didn‚Äôt affect it at all. But having a newborn did lol"
"Government run businesses aren‚Äôt Socialism either. And yes, worker owned co-operatives are a thing that exist now, worker council and union run shops and factories have existed in the past. And yes, Norway is Capitalist, less laissez faire about it but still ultimately capitalist and still bad because the Scandinavian system still relies upon the imperialist exploitation of other states.

TL,DR: Socialism isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwhen the government does things and the more things it does the more socialist it is‚Äù. It‚Äôs democratic control of the means of production by the people who use them."
"Speaking of Split, i was curious as to what kinda goes on. Like are you ‚Äòconscious‚Äô when you switch (you can still see what‚Äôs going on but more like a passenger) or do you kind of black out?"
Go back to your country
"Ah, I see. Also, do you ever ‚Äútransform‚Äù into these other personalities kinda like the movie split, or is that just a Hollywood dramatization of DID?"
"Yea, you get 0 coins for silver, 100 for gold, and 700 for platinum "
have you considered that this might be an agreed-upon arrangement by your parents? not every marriage is monogamous.
Sounds dope lol
Ouch. Good luck on redoing the homework.
"What is the most attractive non-physical attribute that you see in a man?(kindness, intelligence, money, know 2 languages?, etc)"
Yaaaay two christmases!!!
"What's she gonna do, folks?

Depends."
"While you should test your shit, that can‚Äôt be true.  
"
Damn are you going to find a hooker to take your virginity? 
"He told me to kill myself or hed do it for me, so we kinda grew apart.

He was extreme right wing. I was extreme left wing. Kinda sucks and i wish nothing but the best for him"
Did they die or did you two just grown apart/become combative?
What's your best memory when you were high?
Where do i sign up? 
"True. Id rather keep the vague memories, and share the stupid shit"
Why?
Are you 100% sure he wasn't masturbating to porn (without your company) nor getting wet dreams occasionally when you were married ?
Do your alters have their own Reddit/ social media accounts?
Are you Roronoa Zoro?
"Well, I just became upset that the upper class could live in luxury for the rest of their lives without having to work a day due to their inheritance, and still hoard obscene amounts of money."
At least he's honestü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"I think you're overreacting to what's actually being proposed but I understand why it rubs you the wrong way so much. This is an area that I'm willing to compromise on because I think the other things Bernie stands are much more important to me than owning a gun. But, I understand why you hold to that very strongly. I don't think we will come to any kind of agreement on it though."
and what about individual aspirations?
"Are you stressed everyday?

Whats your favorite food?"
"I've seen the usual suspects of shampoo bottles, cellphones (he was a prisoner), and other phallic shaped instruments.

Oddly enough.... EVERYONE insisted they ""fell"" on it. Except the prisoner. And one kid who was surprised the bottle of Dove got stuck. He said...""I have gotten much bigger things in there.""

That guy was awesome because he didn't give any shots. He was honest and owed up to pegging himself. Lol!!"
Are you a pothead?
"I read both kinds of authors, but do so rarely.

I will read it soon."
"I can but it's actually really difficult. Soon it's one hour and I think later, I can't. :)"
I mean it's a fantastical super hero movie. I dont think it was meant to teach people or really imply that people with the disorder were like that. At least from what I saw when I watched the movie. I'm a pretty big fan of the series. 
"Would you rather dress as Germa 66 or Power Rangers?

Did you like avengers?"
So she left you eith blue balls of death.?
haha there is no curtainü§™
They usually named themselves. They sort through things they liked or disliked and stuck with the one they felt the most like themselves
Nope
"I love Queen. I'm not all that familiar with that song to be honest, but I just listened to it and I enjoyed it."
They have dreams?
"&gt;Ostrich

Dinosaurs don't Count. But good choice."
"People showing their IQ? Or EQ? Either way, very disheartening"
"I have some joint dislocation issues, but nothing related to your issues.  In my experience, the dislocations don't hurt.  Getting them back in to place hurts a lot.  Is that true in your experience as well?"
Thank you!
"From 1-10, how upset are you really?"
"I just built a small greenhouse (about 1,200 square feet) in Oklahoma that I intend to use for a commercial grow. Do you have any tips or advice for a first timer?"
What was it like for the family to wake up to a different person each day?
Would you rather be rich or find true love?
"how old are you?  are you normally wild during sex, or do you feel a hidden wild side that may come out now?"
try me
would you use it as an added stimulation next time you're with a guy?  what other toys do you have or want?
"This is how i helped my friend learn. Which hand do u grab dicks with, Ok thats ur right hand. Frim now on that is ur dick hand.  Dick hand = right"
"Did you buy one of those magic wands? Lol they are supposedly the best... ya know, from what I‚Äôve seen in the pornos! "
What'd you do?
Did you go through anything traumatic when you were young which cause this?
Not even I only ended up getting  few hundred coins
Thanks for answering. Now I understand. If you don't mind what would be your (BAP) daily routine in 5he morning.
We used to try and freak each other out with a strange record. 
"Thank you! I‚Äôve actually been busy all morning taking to prospective employers and scheduling interviews. Things are definitely looking up that I‚Äôll be able to work from home, which means I get to see my kid more &lt;happy dance&gt; &lt;happy dance&gt;"
Do you have some music on ? If so what‚Äôs your trip music of choice ?
"Why, it‚Äôs not relevant."
"Ily shark boi. One day you will bless me and pop my award cherry. 

Shamen."
"Depends on what drug, design of the trial, and the therapeutic area. In general I study the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of drugs in development. "
Guess so. Does alcohol lower your inhibitions at all?
"Not until about seven years ago, when my kids were mostly all grown and moved out."

I was on a school ski trip to Switzerland and completely screwed up skiing and ended up falling down the slope breaking a lot of bones in my body
No. If that was a fact then you‚Äôd cure your cancer through the use of vitamins. 
I‚Äôm thinking that I probably don‚Äôt study the kind of drugs you are hoping I study
What is your greatest regret in life?
"Hey, thanks for doing this. I hope you still have time to respond. I do have a couple questions as my fiance disassociates sometimes.

What are your triggers and how do you avoid them so that you don't have a sudden alter change?

I'm sorry, what is the hosts name so I don't act like you don't exist as your own individual person? Do you, as the host, have a dating life outside of the altars? Or does any of your alters date someone? How does that work for you?

And lastly, if you don't mind my asking, how exactly do your altars get created?

(Sorry for the way I spell altars, spell check won't let me spell it differently tly. Sigh. I hate this phone. Galaxy Note 8."
"tell me then, what  is that you desire most"
"Damn, man, that doesn't sound like weirdness. That sounds like some righteous fucking planning."
"Are you involved with Redneck Revolt or any group focused on organizing rural, primarily conservative areas? (Hello from a lefty in Alabama btw &lt;3!) "
Why are you conservative? Does your conservative contribute to you suppressing your sexual orientation? 
"You mentioned that you‚Äôve had different alters at different times. How do alters come into being, or fade away?"
"Depends on what ""worst"" means.

Most gruesome? Definitely arms and legs ripped from the torso. I have also seen open chest cardiac massages. The patient's heart was purposefully exposed in the ER and manually pumped by the physician's hands.

If you mean most fucked up in general? I had to perform skull x-rays on a guy that just shot himself in the mouth after killing his wife and daughter."
"How many levels of trauma center are there?

Do the levels go up or down?

What would a level 8 trauma center look like?"
"What is the worst you've ever seen?

(an*)"
"Hmm idk, I see your point and know that the end result is more satisfying when you can take these meds at a young age due to your biological hormones developing during puberty. But as open as open as I am I wouldn't let my daughter get a tattoo, get plastic surgery, etc. when shes 9 or 13. I know in your situation it's different than just looking in the mirror and saying I dont like my nose, etc. Its more of an uncomfortable ""I was born with the wrong body"" type of deal, i can only imagine what it feels like to feel I'm born the wrong gender and this is a confusing time for any young teen let alone one in your situation. 
   I wont pretend to know jack shit about trans people but I feel like it would benefit you to maybe talk to a therapist/counselor or find some support system (although I dont think it's a mental illness) but it could benefit you to learn to love yourself as you are before you make dramatic, permanent changes. "
"Nuuk and I didn‚Äôt have a job due to my age, I was young and moved around 14 to attend American high school "
"It's not a question but interesting just the same. I'm not sure if I could handle being a waiter, but maybe a bartender? I bet that would give me a similar level of exposure if not more, and I'd meet some really interesting folks along the way. Thanks for the suggestion!"
Stupid is as stupid does.
LOL typical American bigotry. My house in BKK is bigger than your's. Both of my parents are Lawyers and I will be also soon. 
"We‚Äôve been divorced ten years and he‚Äôs occasionally met the guys I‚Äôm dating. As far as I‚Äôm aware he‚Äôs never had a problem with it and never ever wants to get back together with me because I‚Äôm not into monogamy. I always encouraged him to get out and date after the divorce but he just doesn‚Äôt have much sexual interest in women or men. A few women have pursued him since the divorce and he‚Äôs turned them all down. And he did that while we weren‚Äôt living together and he only had the kid on the weekends so he certainly had ample time/opportunities to date. Before I moved in here we had a serious discussion (that u brought up), about how my presence would negatively affect his romantic opportunities and he was fine with that. And I know him well enough to know that he‚Äôs being straight with me. "
"Hey, slfxx, just a quick heads-up:  
**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  
Have a nice day!

^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
Congrats
"Uhhh no shit. You can ""fix"" an asexual üòÇ"
Sounds like someone‚Äôs been rejected a lot and is pretty bitter. You sound like a ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù
That is interesting! Like your brain was trying to construct a stable relationship?
I should be working again in a couple weeks. I have a job interview today actually :)
Which party
We tried an open marriage for six months before we got the divorce. Scroll around this thread for more details. 
There's a lot of of assumptions being made here. I forget AMAs are just everyone else talking about OPs life. 
"Bruges, Ghent, Brussels and Li√®ge are nice cities to visit if you‚Äôre not from Europe. The architecture and city-planning is very different from other places. Each city here has a pretty nice cathedral. 

Check out Brussels if you‚Äôre a comic book fan. Tintin &amp; the smurfs are probably the most famous ones from here, but there are a ton more of em.

WW1 is remembered in the north, while most WW2 museums, sites, etc. Are in the south. Esspecially in the north west of our country it‚Äôs hard to find a place without a graveyard of hundreds of fallen soldiers, thyme Cot being the biggest (spelling might be wrong there.. If that interests you check it out. In Ypers there‚Äôs a memorial every single evening at 8pm, under something called the Menenpoort, a big arch with names of soldiers that couldn‚Äôt be burried. It‚Äôs genuinly bone chilling.

Trains to paris are advertised in the airporthall where international flights arrive. I found it funny for a long time, but Belgium is a pretty nice stop for when you travel around Europe.
Paris -&gt; Brussels, Ghent, Bruges -&gt; Amsterdam -&gt; ...

Not only that but if you‚Äôd go to belgium you can get to a new city pretty easily. So if you‚Äôd have a hotel in Brussels you could visit any city, see all the sights and still get back for drinks in your hotel bar."
"Yea, this I don't get at all. "
Possibly but I‚Äôm no expert. He did see a therapist after the divorce but I don‚Äôt think there was ever a formal diagnosis. 
You literally refered to your child as yikes above... Now you claim you wanted it?
Gitchy gitchy goo.
"It's hard to describe how fun it actually is, if you're good at it. You get a rush similar to a runner's high. Love it!"
"She still hangs out with us about as much as your average teenager. We do family dinners most nights and I‚Äôm getting them both into Star Trek right now. We took a family vacation together recently and she was fine with her parents dragging her to museums, etc. The usual stuff you‚Äôd see in any family. "
"That's smart. Need to remember this one. And also...This might suggest that the person might not want to answer this question at all. 
On the other hand the persom might have missed your question trice. You never know for sure. "
It was at this point that he knew... He'd fucked up.
Miami and San Diego might be better locations lol
"Not to burst your bubble, but at 47 y/o it's really, really difficult to get hired, no matter the trade.

The odds of you becoming employed again become thinner by every passing day."
"Yesterday was good me and my best friend were in a celebratory mood because he‚Äôs doing well at work and my job hunt is going well. Also the kid is really doing great and that makes us both giddy. So there was a lot of laughter and weird jokes yesterday. We went to the store, stopped by a Pok√©mon go event, and then we watched the season premiere of survivor with weird ‚Äúsurvivor‚Äù snacks. (A tradition for us going back years). "
You obviously could just be into cross dressing but have you considered that maybe you're trans? 
"California, United States"
"It could be worse my friend, you're not blind or got diabetes. Live life to the max"
"Bromley or magic for local mountain feel. Killington , stow or smugglers notch for bigger mountain. All in VT"
"Just temporarily. I‚Äôm not sure why I added that I was trying to be accurate to this moment in time but for the vast majority of my  life I‚Äôve been gainfully employed and easily supported myself. I actually turned down several
Job opportunities in other cities so I could live with them and I‚Äôm currently trying to convince employers that I can do the work remotely. I have a job interview today actually :)"
"Haha I was sleeping but I just woke up and I‚Äôve been typing answers. The short version is I wasn‚Äôt 100% sure at the time about monogamy but I was sure (and still am), that I wanted to be his best friend for my whole life, and even though we weren‚Äôt having sex (and in sex therapy for that), he wanted to get married. He saw it more as a social construct than a sexual relationship. "
Hahaha that makes a lot of sense.  Thank you :)
"So insightful, please share more truths."
How did u discover them? Was it just the bug bites or did u physically see one on u? I'm terrified of bugs so I probably wouldve moved out of the house if the same thing happened to me bc I'd be paranoid all the time. 
How predictable.
"You too my dude! Keep your head up and always look for a reason to smile, if you don't find any then make one"
Sammy or Dave?
"Has this kid ever had seizures before? Do doctors have any idea what caused the seizure?

What kind of first aid did you do?

What kind of seizure? Was it tonic clonic? (The kind where they stiffen up and then start twitching.)"
"No questions, but reporting in that my parents had the same arrangement when I was a teenager after my mother's divorce from Stepfather #1 so she could move from another state to be closer (well, that was ONE of the reasons - my mom also has a fear of being alone that she denies, but that's another story). I also found out a friend from college had parents with the same arrangement growing up. Fortunately my parents also co-parented well and it wasn't all bad for me except for one boyfriend who didn't want to come to my house because he was weirded out by it. My friends understood, though."
"Oh, what else do you normally eat? I‚Äôm a chef that‚Äôs why the food interest"
"All of my issues don‚Äôt go away. 

It‚Äôs a connective tissue disorder that affects collagen, joint hypermobility, the GI tract, skin, and a lot more. "
Pretty sure the downvotes are because they're being serious
"Not exclusively, but a good 15%"
Are you going to bribe her?
"Well you did the right thing - you took care of a drunk person even though that wasn't part of what you wanted and honestly, she's lucky to have you.

How long have you been snowboarding for? "
Two years ago I had to break up with my ex. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make.
"I thought we were going to hook up. We were flirting all day and shared a hotel room.

She got very drunk and I ended up taking care of her.

Where would I like to go in the future for snowboarding? I'm in New England so there's plenty of resorts to check out. I'd like to try Wildcat."
"Oh, well that explains everything. You didn't experience the effects of racism growing up in this country. You're just some rich Republican foreigner who doesn't know what they're talking about. Shame on you for acting like you have some sort of understanding of what it means to be a black American! "
"What hurt more, the lightening or your collarbone ?"

What a great person u are. I bet u make everyone around u happy
Did you cheat on him while married?
Do your children know? 
Cheese flavoured cheese.
"Moon sickness is a well documented, however not proven disorder where people have troubles falling asleep on nights with fool moons. I have had it since a child as far as I know, and I can't explain why. 
I meant to say amirite not amr."
"I think gay should be acceptable to use as an insult as long as it isn‚Äôt in an offensive context, but I can see why you were banned."
Has he asked for a DNA test to confirm that he is the biological father of your daughter?
Racist country?? Omg I‚Äôm talking to one of those puppets from the left. I should have figured.. get the fuck out of here you puppet 
"That's insane. My parents pointed out to me recently that their Visa bill comes with a note to say ""if you only make the minimum payments, you will pay off your card in 2042‚Äú. The bit of advice they gave me most growing up was never get a credit card "
beautiful
does the church have any KKK members
Bro I started longboarding and broke my collar bone ffs
thats pretty gay
"Not really, you‚Äôre obviously talking about ghosts, spirits or whatever bullshit. It sounds more like you hear a door slam shut or see a strange object in a photo and assume it‚Äôs a ghost ‚Äòcause it‚Äôs ‚Äúunexplained‚Äù. Lol."
"I think this is a good example of how two people can love each other deeply but still be incompatible as a couple. I think it‚Äôs great that you both realized your relationship, and your relationships with your daughter, were more important than trying to force some socially traditional family unit. As long as all three of you are happy, that‚Äôs all that counts. "
"Whats your pay rate on the lowest budget film?  

Also is it realistic for a set PA with some experience on lower-budget productions in a smaller city able to find work Vancouver?"
Proof for some humans that there is no hope

"I can't help it.  I'll never get over her.

I guess I will try going around."
That‚Äôs the biggest thing that stands out to me lmao
"it depends on where you‚Äôre located, honestly. I mostly worked through fetlife, there‚Äôs not a huge scene local to me and that was the best way for me to meet submissive men.

as for safety, I‚Äôve only come at it from the point of keeping myself safe from potentially dangerous clients, so I can‚Äôt help you there. You can ask for references, but not every domme will give them to you. I know a couple clients who were taken advantage of by scammers, so it can be a concern for sure. "
No. I now have a pretty decent relationship with my mom we are cool now.  Her dad died when she was 14. Her mom was a little crazy. I have a step grandpa and he's all I've ever known. Easily one of the greatest people I know. And on my dad's side his parents are pretty great too.

What's your favorite type of cheese?
