My son has been looking at me weird since I told him fortnite was for losers. 
Get your arse back to NA meetings today. A small backslide is not a complete failure. Keep working at it.
"No offense taken. Yes, I am Autistic."
"Honest question not intended to be offensive:  Are you (or do you think you might be) autistic, Aspergers, or somewhere on the spectrum?

I ask because I'm autistic, and your thoughts/feelings are not uncommon for those on the spectrum."
He isn't good enough to get a victory royale over pops.
Wait did you just say brother? Did I misread that? Did no one catch that? Wait wait wait.....
He was great. We both really enjoyed it.
Which member do you suspect the most 
"It was nothing like I imagined, and that's a good thing."
He's going to kill you and then floss dance all over you 
Just open it and watch the rest of the episode 
"Before we met each other, I had never gotten serious enough with someone to have sex with them, and I don't like the idea of one night stands.

I suppose the idea of sex kinda freaked me out a little.

She had been with people who just used her for sex.

It was a mutual agreement between us to stay abstinent until our wedding night.

It was because of her that I became more comfortable with the idea of having sex and made me feel ready for it.."
ah so you paid extra for this problem? nice!
Was he any good on his first try?

"Yeah I think you’re over thinking this. It’s not like high school where everyone is just waiting to pounce on the first thing they can make fun of your for. 

20% of your class is too hungover to care, 20% is too high to care, 20% is up in the front of the class intently listening and doesn’t care, 40% of your class stayed home to finish watching good eats or whatever they fell asleep watching last night. "
Some random non celeb who has had too much to drink and thought this was a fun game to play? 
Yes. Because then when I opened the laptop I would be immediately be transported to flavortown where there would be no judgment  
Did it meet ypur expectations?
Once in class this girl opened her laptop and that club going up on a Tuesday song started playing really loud. That was four years ago and i still remember.
"Well, he looks at me like a person who he absolutely adores, who just so happens to have had sex. 

No, I've gone long periods without sex. It wasn't difficult. Yes, I did want to make love to him, but I respected his decision and he respects any decisions I make. It was a mutual agreement between us."
"My husband is an Aspie.  He lost his virginity with me, on our wedding night.  

We weren't diagnosed until we were much older (when our kids were diagnosed). 

He was the only guy I dated who ever really ""got"" me.  My best friend, my brother, my husband.  I'm so happy we were able to find each other.  Happy you found someone too.  "
"Not a question but I wish you the best. Alot of people like to judge before they realize they haven't had to battle addiction, it's not fun. I hope you get your shit right and stay away from that shit my dude."
Why don't you plug in a headphone?
"Hey Reddit, this came up as trending. You're slipping."
Thats a whole different way of getting out of the friend zone that I cannot fathom. 
dude you almost won no nut november.  you were so close.
I quit yesterday. So... -1 day.
Amy Schumer because this isn’t funny
"Yes! I now suffer from severe dry eyes and blepharitis (chronically inflamed eyelids). I use Systane Ultra eye drops all day long (I’ve found those to work the best for me) and at night I put a thick petroleum jelly type eye ointment in my eyes, essentially making me blind all night long. 

I also use Occu-Soft eyelid scrubs twice a day and prescription Avenova eyelid spray twice a day. Warm compresses and hot steamy showers help too. I’m looking into getting a humidifier as well. "
Nice try Jennifer!
"Happily! 

One of my favorites is from when we were just starting to develop feelings for each other. 

During our senior prom, all of our friends were out at the prom. That wasn’t his &amp; I’s thing, so we hung out downtown waiting for our friends to leave the prom to later meet up with them at the hotel we booked for everyone to spend the night at. During this time, we went to a Vietnamese restaurant. It wasn’t a date at all, him &amp; I would frequently go out to eat together so I didn’t think anything of it. Well, I ordered pho &amp; began eating it with a spoon. He started freaking out &amp; was like “what’re you doing?! You eat it with chopsticks!” I told him I had no idea how to use chopsticks, despite tons of practicing. He spent a solid hour teaching me how to use chopsticks. Once I finally got the hang of it, he just kinda watched me eat my pho with a sappy look on his face (which is never the case for him). We both agree that it was that day him &amp; I realized we had feelings for each other. Of course, since we’re both shy as hell, no one made a move until 2 months later lmfao. "
I see you're familiar with Canadian attractions.
"Does your husband look at you as an expert of sex? 

Also, is it difficult going abstinent when you’ve already had sex?"
Where were your parents?!
I did meet with a medical malpractice attorney but decided not to pursue a case against the urgent care facility. This drug is routinely given out for nausea. If anything I wanted to sue the drug manufacturer but no attorney would take it on a contingency fee and basically told me that Big Pharma has such deep pockets and there are already so many Reglan class actions going on. They said there was no way I’d have the resources or money to go after them. They would fight it to the death. And it’s very hard to sue an FDA approved drug. IMO it should be taken off the market. Google “reglan tardive dyskinesia” and watch YouTube videos of people suffering from this drug. The fact it is still on the market and given to people like me for nausea is absolutely insane to me. It has changed how I approach medicine entirely. It is a highly potent antipsychotic drug. One pill caused permanent neurological damage in my brain. 
)) no. Ride a Bus
Right? OP must be a freshman in his/her first semester. 
Isn’t wonderland closed? Or is that Christmas market already open? 
Do you need to use eyedrops to keep your eyes from drying out too much?
Yes. It’s True. and I am ashamed of such Russians)
"I'm a little tipsy, very bored, and thought it might be fun. You think I'm the only celeb who lurks on reddit? Get real! "
Were you abstinent on purpose? 
"Haha of course. I usually just chalk it up to ignorance, it’s not something that ever happened with anyone significant.

At my college, I once had a random student place his hand atop my head and attempted to excercise demons inside me. I haven’t noticed any demons in me recently so I guess it worked."
"Yeah it sucked at first but it is truly amazing what someone can get used to. I’ve learned that it takes about six weeks for something to become a “routine” so now I’m so used to it it doesn’t bother me anymore. My brother told me a great analogy I love. He said if a dog loses a leg they don’t mourn the loss of the leg. They get on with it and live their best life with three legs. My goal is to be like a dog, haha. "
"It is a total nightmare. My eyelids start to contract and tremor violently upon prolonged closure. Here is what I’ve experimented with:

1. I tried using tape to tape them down but my eyelids wormed their way out of the tape and I woke up with the tape stuck to my bone dry eyeball. Having to pull that off really sucked. 

2. I tried weighted eyelid masks. The tremors caused me to experience vertigo so couldn’t do that. 

3. Now I’m using external metal eyelid weights I tape to the outside of my eyelids. I wear really tight moisture proof goggles - so tight that they almost cause pain around my eye sockets. The pain from that can distract my brain a little from the tremors and I’m able to sleep. When I’m asleep the tremors stop apparently and my eyes open. 

4. I also take a high potency magnesium pill every night before bed. 400 mg. It has changed my life. Relaxes me and helps calm me to sleep. The anxiety from the tremors just makes my tremors worse so it is a vicious cycle. The magnesium helps keep that in check. "
"I used to sometimes think if I was to do it, it would feel a bit unpleasant, and possibly hurt a bit...but damn...after it happened, I could not stop thinking about it. Go to 3.30mins of this video I'm linking to and that's how I was for days...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6t9R4GBejo"
"Haha I was waiting for this. 
Okay, so they have a book that's fairly thick and is loaded with rules. One of those rules was that men have to be clean shaven. I asked them, and their reason was that in the '60s they wanted to look different than the hippie movement (they quoted a verse in the bible about avoiding the appearance of evil). I asked why they still had it and they couldn't give me a good reason. Most of them dont even think it makes sense but they all live it because if they challenge it they'd be considered ""worldly"". 
That's what ultimately made me break away. Fucking facial hair.
That being said, I also started questioning at like 14 (I was an incredibly thoughtful and mature 14 yr old) why we couldn't watch any sort of videos or have the internet.

Isn't there a sound disable button on your keyboard that will allow you to quickly open it and disable the sound before it starts to play?
Not OP but I was groomed by a 28 old guy when I was 14 and my mother was completely fine with it. She was a teacher and all. Sometimes you can't count on parents even if they seem decent.
I'm always a wizard.
Do you go to work on a tank?¿
Why don't you walk outside for 30 seconds and open it?

"My parents are both dysfunctional as hell. My dad has always been a pos, but my mom was amazing up until she randomly did meth out of nowhere when I was 15. Hasn’t been the same ever since. 

I’ve always been a good kid. Never got in trouble growing up, made good grades, never smoked or drank, had a good friend group, everything. So my parents trusted me. My ex boyfriend would make me call my mom when he wouldn’t let me leave his house to tell her I was spending the night at a girlfriends house. :/ "
"LOL he started out as a good friend, then my best friend.  We became such good friends, and knew each other so well that he was like a brother to me.  The attraction/relationship came later.  "
Probably myself
"I think its very sweet, having read both AMAs.

Did you feel that decision to abstain made your relationship stronger in any aspect?
Did it make any part harder due to restrictions on the physical intimacy? 

I also have to ask, how many times the first night (or day)? 😬
"
"Did he do anything during sex that had you thinking: ""Yeah, totally a virgin."""
"My tinder date fell through so I went to a club to have a drink, dance a bit, maybe make a friend or meet a new lover. While there I ran into him and we started catching up. As the night went on it became pretty apparent that he was at kind of a low point, feeling alone rejected and yeah horny. My heart went out to the guy, I know what that’s like. I suffer from depression and anxiety, and physical contact with other people is the fastest way to set me straight, and he’s similar to that.

He made a joke about making a pass at me, and I know he finds me extremely attractive, so I decided to help a friend out. I just grabbed him and kissed him, slapped him on the ass, and reassured him that he was a great guy and to get back out into the game. 

After I went home he texted me asking if he could give me a bj. I thought about it and said sure, why not. So he came over and gave me a bj. He was really good at kissing the surrounding area and sucking my balls, but tbh I’ve had much better head.

He then asked if I’d put it in him, and I thought about it and decided hey why not? He really wanted it and it’s not like it would bother me so I agreed and I put on a condom and he lubed up and I fucked him in the ass. We only did cowboy and doggy, and I much preferred doggy so that I didn’t have a dick on my stomach lol. 

After he finished I made breakfast and we hung out and played video games till he went home around 6am. 

The only thing that was not okay is that he hung the hand towel he used to clean up his cum and ass lube BACK ON THE RACK. Who the fuck does that? I texted and told him that was super nasty. "
"They are definitely great for a fast food joint. The place where I worked has two cashiers and four kiosks, but it doesn't really help anything when the restaurant is overflowing, like McHappy day, the kitchen just can't keep up. At one point it did more harm than good because the receipt printer was busted. So customers had to keep asking us what number they were."
"I went to a very religious high school, and she had been included in some of our praise and worship chapels before making the switch to pop. I can distinctly remember having a chapel praying for her to find her way back to Christ and to repent after I kissed a Girl was released. I started skipping chapel more frequently after that. "
Yup. My mom loved him. My dad didn’t know about him. 
"&gt; Did you feel that decision to abstain made your relationship stronger in any aspect? Did it make any part harder due to restrictions on the physical intimacy?

Yes it made us stronger. I found it easy. We still spent a lot of time kissing each other and finding other ways to express our fondness of each other.

&gt; I also have to ask, how many times the first night (or day)? 😬

The first time was on our wedding night. We only did it once that night.

Metoclopramide (brand name Reglan). I was given it at an urgent care for nausea when I checked myself in with severe dehydration from food poisoning. One oral 10mg pill did this to me. This happened one year ago. It is permanent and incurable and the dystonia (movement disorder) may spread. Reglan is the DEVIL. 
I heard that many russians are against homosexuality because people aren't getting well informed about it. I also heard there's a widespread belief that pedophilia and bestiality are basically synonymous with homosexuality. Is this true or just a rumor?
What was the first thing you remember noticing that was wrong (or bothered you) about your cult?  Were you in college before you knew something wasn’t quite right?
"If he wasn’t great on his first time would you have told him, just how ruthless are you? lol "
Have you masturbated before?
Are you still religious or has the experience of leaving the cult changed your religious views?
Good to know the anxiety I had when this sort of thing happened to me was completely accurate!

"He’s been there for me in the past, been a great wingman at the club, always helping me pick up women, and just a good friend in general. The poor guy was just feeling really down and alone and horny and I def knows what that is like, and I know he finds me extremely attractive, so I gave the man what he needed to feel better. "
"You mention that, while you wouldn’t go back to your old job, sacrifices have been necessary. Can you elaborate? What has been gained and what has been lost? And how much have your previous earnings made this transition possible? Would it have been possible to make this transition from a less lucrative position?

The idea of shaking things up and pursuing a less “prestigious” but more meaningful career holds some intrigue to me. But I don’t think I’m as dissatisfied with my job as many, so there’s a little more of an opportunity cost in my case."
Have fun at Wonderland! Old gypsy predictions aren't real.
No. A have penjaja XD
Nothing too crazy. This one lady didn't know how to use the McD's app and wouldn't give us her phone to help her. So she contacted the owner of that place and said we were rude to her (even though we tried everything we could to help). She got a full refund on her food that she had to order through good old fashion face to face conversation.

People can still have fulfilling lives without sex. Just taker your time. My husband has a relative who lived to their 90s without ever having a sexual encounter. That person felt fulfilled with everything they did in life.

What do you think of the new self-ordering kiosks that are being put in at many locations?
Honestly I'm on of those people who have a sense of humor and know about questions. I'm fine with it. The other day I was at Longwood gardens and a kid with his father was walking by. Tiny kid. The father pulls him in and whispers BE NICE! I chuckled. 
"One guy wanted a burger with only the bun, meat, and ketchup for his son. This, though, he only told me after two failure burgers. First, he ordered a cheeseburger with only ketchup. But that burger comes with cheese unless specifically ordered with ""No Cheese"". This was done on the kiosk. He goes to his car but then comes back. 

He then asks me to get him a McDouble with only ketchup. This, too, comes with cheese unless specified. He goes back to his car for the second time. He comes back and tells me hysterically that his son hates cheese and wants nothing but ketchup on it.

I give him a hamburger with only ketchup, the burger that he wanted. This all took about 20 minutes and we laughed fairly hard about it. He said that I should get a rise for my patients and helpfulness.  "

"My dad died of an overdose 2 weeks ago. It’s suspected that the cocaine was cut with fentanyl but we won’t know for sure until the toxicology results come back. He lived in a small town in Georgia and there were 3 other fatal overdoses on the same day. We were not close for a lot of reasons but the main one being his addiction. 

The thing I’ve heard from his friends and coworkers over and over again is how good of person he was but that he could never get himself together to make his life right. Now he never gets that chance to turn things around. To be perfectly blunt don’t let that be you. As the child of an addict seeing the damage that it does not only to the person but the people who love them I implore you to seek help. You are literally putting your life on the line every time you get high. The overdose epidemic shows no sign of slowing down and you never know what is actually in the drugs you’re taking. It only takes one time. Just once. 

I wish you lots of luck. I know it’s not easy. "
"Would Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives have been a better option?"
"I absolutely love manhattan. I’ve lived in New York my whole life (Long Island and Queens) but just moved to the city in the summer. Love the broadway shows, comedy scene, etc which has made it a blast. Plus my commute went from 2+ hours to 15 minutes.

I’m not much of a beach guy but I’ll hang out on a boardwalk occasionally. My Twilight-esque pale skin and heavy machinery are not too equipped for hours on the sand.

I’ve used dating apps with mixed results and was in a relationship recently for a little over a year. I think that format is much more friendly for people with disabilities than going out to bars, clubs, etc.

"I wouldn’t say I was ever bullied, but there was definitely times growing up where I felt excluded and somewhat isolated. I’ve gotten far more social over the past few years, and have a pretty typical social life nowadays, but that was a bit more difficult growing up.

I have had friends suggest to others that they should rearrange plans to make them accessible so I can join, and that’s a great example of someone stepping in on behalf of me."

"I had a similar experience, except mine wasn't permanent.

I took loxipine for about 6 months, basically the same type of drug as reglan, except for different purposes, and I had these eyes problems as well. Except my eyes would tremor and twitch all the time, along with regular blinking. I had to fall asleep with one eye open to at least make it somewhat comfortable. It was painful and really irritating. It took me a month to figure out the cause of this sudden problem. I am so thankful it didn't stick around, or I caught it early enough, because I was reading things that this kind of side effect is usually permanent.

"Yeah. It was Christianity. It's on the borderline of cult and non-cult (they say they aren't one 🤷‍♂️). The main cultlike thing is that they have an additional book they live by besides their holy book. Also, in the day to day they live like a stereotypical cult.

Its 13 (I think) churches throughout the midwest (mostly IN). Their theology is based in surprisingly benign christianity (methodism, nazarene, Wesleyan), but they use all of the rules from over a hundred years ago in terms of how they dress and live. They proudly say ""never change"" to each other... it's like their mantra. Basically, throughout the past few hundred years these core groups have split up over and over... they were always the most conservative group."

almost all stereotypes are wrong. we are the same as the rest of the planet. but we lived in a closed country for 70 years and know little about the rest of the world. therefore, we often react to some things with isolation.

We were raised in a small town cult and their age difference was a non issue for the parents.

Back to the couple: 
They are married with 2 kids  now. I moved away (far far from the cult) so I see pictures of their family on IG. But her and her Sister in-law (his sister) have dead eyes. I talk to her sister a bit and she went into therapy after she got out. I want to scream save your sister!!!

Date? I have panic attacks going outside even when I need something. Lol. Date. You kidder you. 
Yes.
"&gt; It's okay, you said in another comment you are different. All you can do is educate your friends, if that doesn't make you a target :) Have a nice day and thank you

Thanks you. thanks for the question and for the communication"
"Surprisingly not as many as I would have expected. I think the main problems I had were when I would want to go out and visit a place in the city but it would be getting dark and I wouldn’t want to go alone. 

Never got harassed or threatened or even talked down to. It definitely helped that I was also in first world countries for the most part. I think as long as you’re safe, vigilant, and prepared, travelling alone can be a great experience.  "
"It's not bad
7/10"
*i* see you’re a man of culture as well
She was completely okay with it.
"I'm not a monster, I peel pieces off like it's supposed to be eaten"
No
Has anyone ever patted you on the head? What did you say? People lean on my wheelchair headrest every now and again but I’ve luckily not experienced a pat on the head 
"I too was in the financial industry, quit and have been in the blue collar workforce for 15 years now. What exactly is your job title? Carpenter, Iron Worker?"
"This is an important question and wish it got upvoted more. The sacrifices have been, besides pay, a general downsizing of life. I'm not jetting in and out of town for weekend trips. You will not be rubbing elbows with ""movers and shakers"" of industry or politics or media, which is sometimes a perk of working in Corporate America. The internet is slower. There is a certain amount of culture shock, like the people I work with are into hunting and racing their trucks rather than backpacking through Thailand and going to music festivals. There are no ""cool"" or ""trendy"" places to see in town, and you need to be deliberate about making friendships and relationships with the people in the community - it's not like you can go meet 100 new people at some event. None of those things are particularly sacrifices to me, but they definitely can be for some.

Also - working with your hands is both good and bad for your body. You will be stronger, but it will grind you down. And there is far, far less availability for upwards career advancement.

My previous earnings helped me pay off my student loans and put a little money in the bank so I could move unencumbered, but I have no big nest egg. It would be absolutely possible for anyone who could put a few grand in the bank. I would say that mere job dissatisfaction would not be enough for me to recommend this jump for people. For me, the biggest benefits were leaving behind yuppie culture, shorter commutes, less people, more nature."
How long were you clean before you relapsed?
