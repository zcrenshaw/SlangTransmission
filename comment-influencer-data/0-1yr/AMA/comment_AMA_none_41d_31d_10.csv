"See the comment from u/takemymoneynow? That sentiment was driven home alongside a bunch of fake data showing that the EU was not only taking over the UK, but was bleeding them dry (plus, stories about how immigrants were dangerous). The reality is that while beauracracy is real and a valid issue in general for all levels of governance, the UK had a massive seat at that table and played a huge role in directing the EU, rather than the other way around. The UK also gained far more from trade/EU policy than it spent to be a part of it, but these facts were essentially supressed under the avalanche of bs that Cambridge Analytica threw at susceptible folks. 

I'm not saying there isn't rational argument to be had, but I am saying that the vast number of people who voted on either side voted without full knowledge. And those few who had the facts straight overwhelmingly voted Remain."
"I absolutely hate when people dont tip. Or if they pretend to give me a good tip and say something like ""you can keep the change"" and it ends up being $2. Also when people freak out over nothing like not having enough napkins, or when they try to get my attention by yelling across the resturant. My coworkers are cool, we all talk mad shit about the people. The schedules cool, I work 3 days a week and make enough to pay the bills, school, and take vacations. The moneys good tho, I guess the customers are the worst part. Ive seen some things that I never thought people would do"

Did you get caught by police?
"I understand you feel insulted by the dude, but why are you going down the list of bigoted lines? Like why are you using bisexuals and the liking of trans people as insults?"
How to heck did you learn this? I'm guessing it's not very easy to find a proper way in the internet. Did you have a chemistry background and someone taught you.?
"I tried LSD when I was 19 and fell in love with the trip. It cleared my brain. My friend knew a chemist and I was always interested in chemistry so I was always testing new product from him (he would also grow psilocybin mushrooms of various strains). Casually hanging around with him led to me getting to know lab products, start having a deeper understanding of the synthesizing process of LSD-25 and from there on it was history. It was how I lived for 13 years before I was busted."
"Please pm because I forget to check back on posts that say they will update. Also, when saying my name, I know I fucked up. I did menance instead of menace"

This oddly sounds like America. Not that I'm actually from there but that mentality and politicians encouraging those beliefs even if it's really against their own good. Propaganda is scary.

" Sometimes I feel my muscles (or even nerves ? ) tic on my head (around brain area and around my ear)  , especially when I make angry or sad thoughts . Any advice ?"
"Yes! I love my life now. I was in a bad environment living with my mother, and because of this incident the police sorta looked into my background and saw it wasn’t safe for my sister and I to live with her. We now live with our father, and we moved away from where the incident happened, and I love my new school and my new friends so much. So whilst the incident was awful and I’d never want anyone to experience it, in a way I’m thankful that it helped get me to a better place."
"It’s a really lengthy processes that requires thousands of dollars in lab equipment. I won’t go through the whole process because there’s info all over the web but I extracted my LSA (lysergic acid amide) from a plant, then the lysergic acid (main chemical of LSD) to LSD through all the over hundreds of steps."
"Before going further, does your discord grade mean a lot to you or your problem come from what you see like a betrayal?"
Why?

"My grade meant a lot to me, i felt like a responsibility, and I felt like i was pretty good at it, but the betrayal comes from the fact that my friends did it."

Yes.
"No the prison system is pretty archaic. Dont get me wrong there are some criminals that belong there. There are alot that dont. Rehabilitation in some form other than prison is best for about 80 percent of the people that are there. The consequences for committing a petty crime (1-2 year sentence) AND going to prison are crazy. Even if you do your time with no infractions and get out
1. Your at the bottom of the labor pool
2. You parole or probate in the same area you were causing trouble in.
3. Theres an 80% chance you will re affend within 2 years.
4. Wash, rinse, repeat
As far as improvements, prison is a basic communal living system that is as self sustained as it can be. To house humans at the lowest cost possible, federal, state and private.
For most states prisons take up about 60 to 80 percent of the budget for the whole state.
I'm sure by putting those two forces at work you can see where the problem lies.
Criminal Justice reform I believe is the answer to our prison problem.
Now as far as mental health. EVERY Prison and Jail in Every state, city, and county are the DEFACTO mental health wards.
Then you add Detention and Correctional Officers with very limited mental health training into the mix.

TL;DR Dont go to prison you will probably go back, they cost the most of your tax dollars and are ran cheaply, criminal justice and mental health reform laws need to happen."
"From what you said, you are closer from one of the co-owner than the others and the fact that he voted against you is what amplify your feelings the most, am I right?"

What’s a prepper? What is arsed
What's your favourite movie?
I ask because I have something similar and my experience is the total opposite.
Game of thrones the mountain vs the viper
I am extremely curious about this because death is ultimately where we all go. Do you feel like these experiences are real or just the result of blood deprived brain?
Robots vs wrestlers himym
"It's probably depressing for some people but I do think these experiences are ultimately triggered from lack of blood to the brain as the brain is still functioning. A scientist in this field would probably be better at answering this but if you were suddenly obliterated I feel like you would not have the same experience. However, we have no way of knowing what happens to our consciousness once that connection is severed so it's all belief and philosophy after that."
how many hours of sleep did you get last night? what were you doing to get so many/few hours?
"1. Do you have any perks, discounts or benefits as an employee?
2. Have you ever come across a situation where an FBI or police raided your hotel?  If so, can you tell us what happened and what was the outcome?
3. Is working at the hotel is your full time job?  If so, what's your next professional goals?  If not, what are you currently studying in school?
4. Most hotels have employees who are fluent in second or third language.  Do you know more than one languages?  If so, can you list them and give reasonings why you learned this language?"

Def not a question. Haha
"It’s normal and very common with LSD abuse and it’ll probably never go away, but I can tell you my HPPD has gotten better. I still am spacey, see the trails, floaters, colors shift and mix, I see the visual snow and the “lightning”, all that. My HPPD is totally visual."
Did he ever give you creepy vibes?
How are you still alive being ran over by a frucking tuck??
"1. In your past life, did you originally wanted to become a correctional officer in the first place?
2. In your prison system, is there a fitness centre?  If so, can you describe the setup?  I know that it depends on different areas, but I do know that some prison do not even have a fitness centre due to using weights as a weapon.

I come from a very school/university oriented family and can't quite shake the status/obligation of a degree and at the same time I have increasing doubts about going to university.

Also I come from a family deeply affected by suicide and have struggled with depression myself so I see just living in a way that keeps you above ground is beyond honorable; it is world changing."

I've often thought about this if I won. I think I'd pay off or purchase a home for the handful of loved ones I have. And a brand new car for each of them instead of cash gifts they could irresponsibly manage. Youd still be gifting them a massive amount but ensuring their future is successful too. Living mortgage free is a dream.

"I knew I had anorexia around 13, when my friends started to notice, and the term anorexia was used lots. I found the symptoms to be strikingly similar to my condition, though i be never been diagnosed; In my mind intervention is sometimes an immediate solution, but in the long term will just throw the sufferes back into full relapse; though many of my life goals involve my weight, some don't. I want to finish school, to into independent studies, and open a BAKERY(ikr the irony). And in my mind, recovery is so far away, and my ed has started to become addicting, so it will be many years before a full recovery."
Did you have a dream and how long did the dream feel
"Gal Gadot is good looking but I mean I've seen probably the most beautiful girls ever at the club.

That shit is friggin toxic as hell in these amounts. Stay safe dawg.
You think your dog would get jealous if I slipped in and beat them guts?
I have been having unprotected sex with my partner for the past near 11 years on a daily or near daily basis. And there was no pregnancies. You have competition!
"I personally would kill an animal as soon as it became a necessity for my survival.  Fortunately,  in our western society, we have the option not to kill animals for consumption because we have other options for our nutrition. It would however become necessary to kill if I were trying to defend myself or family. The other ethical reason to kill an animal would be to  to put them out of their misery like we sometimes do with our pets. Also, there are different forms of pest control that are natural like getting a cat where they naturally eat meat for their survival."
r/ihavesex
What is your typical customer?
"Yeah it was very fast,I couldn't even think about what to dream about before I fell asleep,normally it takes me 30-50 seconds to fall asleep."
Your forgetting one major thing here. Cows eat way more plants then we do. The calorie conversion of filtering our nutrition through a cow is significantly smaller than if you just eat plants. We currently grow enough plants to to feed the world and still have a huge surplus. Problem is a lot of the world is hungry because we feed most of our plants to animals.
"Plants might have a chemical reaction to their environment but it is not categorized as pain considering they literally do not have pain receptors. They cannot experience suffering in the same way that plants do. Again, it is irrelevant because we reduce the amount of plant consumption if it’s not being fed to animals. No where does it say that I think or do not think the life of an animal does not matter. What I said was the condition of the argument for that scenario. Don’t be presumptions yourself.  You bring up the point of food deserts. It’s a good point because in that situation, you may not have the choice. It that scenario, you may have to eat meat to survive making it ethical to preserve your life. Fortunately, a lot of us do have the choice and then eating meat becomes needless making killing animals a pleasure or want rather then a need. If we went vegan, the amount of animals that need to be bred would reduce, reducing the need for crops to feed them, which means those drops could be used to feed humans more efficiently.  To your last point, I don’t believe plants have a nervous system so I don’t think it is unethical to eat plants. I was just creating the scenario for the sake of argument. Also, we have plenty of land and crops to efficiently feed the entire world but since most of it goes to animals, third world countries that sell there crops to animal agriculture ends up hungry. They could use those crops to feed themselves if we didn’t eat so many animals because there is plenty for them."
"Thank you! I dont know what youre doing, but have fun in that too"

"Yes I'm very very sure, from 4:10pm to 9:40 am."
Okay but have you ever accidentally farted on someone?
"Yeah It was a retarded move,won't do it again."
"Great job picking and choosing the pieces of the authors many arguments that verify your confirmation bias. The point is to have a general idea of how our digestive system works compared to the rest of the animal kingdom. It clearly shows, with credible resources, that out physiology is more closely related to that of a frugivore. You are definitely more closely related to a cow than a wolf. If you think you are I challenge you to eat the diet of a wolf which is raw uncooked flesh, do it using only your teeth and no knife. Then, eat some grass. Which one has a worse effect in your body? Only eating grass will not sustain you but it will not harm you. The link shows that you are not a cow/herbivore. It shows that you are a fruigivore and you need to have fruit in your diet as well as plants."

"Yea, I thought that I may as well just go for the upper end so I won't need to think about upgrading for a awhile. And I am still sitting around thinking about upgrading, just the curse of having components always coming out and being able to change it up. The i7 9700k isn't that far off the i9 and performs on par in many things. Just need to make sure the i9 stays cool as it is a warmer chip and I have it running at 5ghz.

In your case the i7 9700k still outperforms the current ryzen line in gaming so your good there. That's until the r9 3950x comes out probably, but that's a $750 cpu its questionable whose really going to buy it for gaming."

Yes. Humanity has colonized much of the solar system and even several neighboring star systems to a lesser extent. 

&gt;Are the depression rates lower among humanity? 

Yes. Mental healthcare is both more advanced and more accessible in my time, and the freedom from labor for most of the population has removed many of the stresses that plagued people in your time.

&gt;Are there still poor, war- stricken countries? 

Both poverty and war have been greatly reduced since your time. Some regions of the world are less wealthy than others, but the average human lives a relatively comfortable and safe life.

Someone does not like me too much. I knew I would get some sort of hate for this. I used get hate from male.
I use a saline spray then use a plaster if needed. I've jever needed more than that
"1. I’ve never met somebody in person like me but I often go to r/synesthesia and look for posts about sound to color synesthesia and how others experience it. 

2. No I don’t

3.  I was about 14 or 15 and me and my sister were listening to the song the scientist by cold play. She said it sounded blue, as in sad. I was like ??? What do you mean? Chris martin’s voice is yellow! Cue a conversation where she thought I was a fucking maniac, a couple sessions where I asked my therapist about it, and my own research and I came to the conclusion I have synesthesia. 

4. The colors I see are often random. The first time I heard a recording of a theremin ( a type of instrument) I had no idea what I was listening to. However, I knew it was a like green type of color. Even when I learned what it was it was still the same color. So when I don’t know what something is I still see whatever color my synesthesia tells me it is. I know that sounds confusing, sorry I can’t seem to find a way to explain it any better. 

5. The same sound will forever be the same color. I play the flute, and flutes for me are lavender. No matter when I hear a flute, I’ll always hear lavender. 

6.i can see multiple colors at once when hearing multiple sounds. For me I see lines of colors at the edges of my vision, so let’s say I hear somebody with a red voice and a guitar which is green. I’d simple see lines of both red and green at the edges of my vision. 
 
Hope I answered in a way that’s understandable, sometimes it’s hard to explain. If you have any more questions feel free to ask!"

2. Does this ability is genetic meaning does your other family also share this trait?

3. Do you keep in track with hearing colours into your journal as cross reference?

4. Please correct me if I’m wrong and no worries if you don’t have an answer.  I heard that Deaf people whose first language is ASL may or may not have synesthesia.  Have you ever came across with this findings?

5. Assuming that you found out when you were a child, does this freaks you out?

6. Can you tell if people are lying to you?  If so, what colour do you see when people verbally give you false information?

7. What colour do you see when you hear calming and emotional music?  Same for angry music? 

8. Does the colours change when you hear different foreign languages?  If so, how do you describe?

"A friend of mine had a family member in a close to the same situation. There's was a rape and murder and they didn't have the capability to solve the case until 2014. The rapist was caught the night of the murder with my friends uncle, so now it has been connected he was convicted for being apart of it.  I think he gets out next year because he told the story."
Watch John Oliver. He reports the news this way.
"There were things not too unlike this that happened to me when I was about your age...

I went on to have dysfunctional relationships and it led to dysfunction in my marriage. I had a warped sense for years that it was “OK, not a big deal,” when it was really something ugly in my psyche that festered slowly for years. 

Years of therapy post-divorce sorted it out. It was hard work and lots of tears and years of antidepressants.

Don’t trick yourself into thinking this was normal. It wasn’t, and you couldn’t truly consent. That’s why there are laws against this sort of thing. 

And in your case, dude went to jail for whatever reason. Context clue: not healthy, not good. 

Therapy is your friend, and I mean that with all sincerity. This is nothing to make light over. How you handle it — or not — can impact the course of your life."
"I'm feeling totally self conscious and debating deleting this thread.  I'm not going to do it, I just wanted to share."
How many of your peers got married in college?
"Hi! I’ll try to answer all of these as best I can. 

1. I found this out a few years ago when I was about 14 or 15. Me and my sister were listening to “the scientist” by Coldplay. She said the song sounded blue, as in sad. I was like huh? Chris martin’s voice is obviously yellow! Cue a conversation where she thought I was fucking crazy and a couple of session with my therapist and a bit of research and I found out I have synesthesia!

2.synesthesia is in fact genetic. I’ve asked my father about it, and he does not seem to have synesthesia. I’d ask my mother because women are more likely than men to have synesthesia but I have not seen her or had contact with her since I was a child so I’ll never know. However, although synesthesia is genetic it does not mean that my specific form of synesthesia was passed on to me because a relative also had sound to color synesthesia. Many different types of synesthesia exist, so they could have had synesthesia with the association of colors to numbers or letters etc. etc. it also means that if I have a child and they end up having synesthesia, they could have a different form of synesthesia than what I have. 

3. I do not

4. I’ve never heard of that, so I’m not sure. However I will look into it because that’s very interesting. 

5. It does freak me out a bit. I find it really weird that not everyone experiences this. Although half the time I don’t pay any mind to it because I’m so used to it, I can’t imagine not having it. Music especially for me is an experience, especially going to concerts. I can’t imagine going to a concert and not hearing the colors of the music and the crowd screaming or singing along. 

6. Sadly, I cannot. Wish I could!

7. It’s not really the emotion that goes into the music. It’s the instruments involved and whatever color the singers voice is. 

8. Colors don’t change based on language."
Sounds like a magic 8 ball response. 🎱
"I see the colors as lines at the edges of my vision. They’re not completely opaque. Have you ever seen a lighting gel? It’s similar to that in opacity. I am constantly seeing colors, and to me that’s normal. I’ve always been like this and I never knew it wasn’t normal. I’ve compared it to walking down a busy city street. It’s loud and obnoxious, but as you walk down the street you stop paying attention to it. The volume level of the street is the same, but you’re used to it. For me it’s the same thing, I’m very much used to it as I’ve been like this my whole life so I don’t necessarily pay attention to it."
Is this a surprise to you?

"Now, let me please begin with a snickers without peanuts, i feel like this would be very interesting, although i do enjoy snickers, i prefer Mars bars so i would probably be happy with this, although the whole point of a three muskateer in my opninion is the joy of eating the nougat, so i would probably contact the company, ask for a refund and make another AMA on reddit"

"She has low empathy also, but not in the same way. Well we don't have huge fights really they are just temperamental flare ups, mostly on my side. She ignores me, I leave it alone and the situation resolves. No, there isn't really a point at the moment. When there is a financial benefit we might."
Thanks!
"This is just amazing!!! I have a few questions:

1- have you ever met someone like you? If so, did you compare colors?

2- I know you see colors when you hear sounds. But do you eventually think of the sound when you see a specific color? For example a sou d you really hate could be grey and when you see grey you think of the unpleasant sound

3- how did you found out and at what age that other people couldn’t see it?

4- when you don’t recognize a sound or don’t know what it is, what color do you see?

5- do colors ever change or the same sound will be forever the same color?

6- when you have more than one sound (which I believe is almost every time) do you see all the colors separate or together or how does it work?

Ok I thought it would be like 2 questions but I got carried away ahah, sorry if it is too much but I’m dying of curiosity!

Have fun with your colors, it seems like you days are much fun"

"I admire your perseverance for learning multiple languages and the fact that being deaf does not hold you back from achieving greatness.

1. I know that you already listed the languages.  For each language, can you provide a brief description on why you learned this language X, Y, Z?

2. Assuming you date, do you find that your attractive level increases by the number of languages you know, thus, improving a positive and successful date?

3. What made you fell in love with the idea of being a polyglot?  Was there a YouTube video or encounters with polyglots from your earlier life?

4. Assuming you make friends through language meetup, has any of them invite you to their intimate life events such as being a best man or bridesmaid at the wedding because a friendship can be so strong due to a common language.

5. Can you share any funny stories where people bad-mouth about you and call them out in their foreign language in public situations?  Also, tell us if you have any eavesdropping situations!

6. During travelling, have you come across a dangerous situation with locals and the language skill set saved your life?

OP, I’m damn impressed and keep it up with your language skills!  I appreciate if you can answer all my questions!"

"I'm British and have just come back from Northern Ireland a few days ago and saw this post. I won't add too much to what u/takemymoneynow has already said but instead talk about why the public opinion has changed. On the day of the election a large poll was taken (Lord Ashcroft poll -[https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/](https://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/) ) and it broke down how and why people voted the way they did.

Most of the media looked at this and started to paint half the population as a bunch of idiots this plus with a government who were inept to carry out leaving the EU and basically went to a negotiation by giving up everything to begin with and then try to negotiate from there. The whole thing has been a mess and some people and politicians who voted remain have been trying to get the country into another referendum or even reverse the process altogether. On top of that something that wasn't made very clear back in 2016 was how Northern Ireland was going to be treated if the UK left the EU. I have family back in Northern Ireland and I don't think anyone there wants to see the old style hard boarders back again or any return of the troubles.

Regardless of however I or other people voted, once again the media and the politicians have played us with the old 'divide and rule' plan. The political discussion has dragged on for too long and it's put people against each other when before there were no issues.

Most people I'm guessing now in the UK have Brexit fatigue and are losing hope with politicians, they either want the new UK PM Boris Johnson to hurry up and get on with it or have hope that any delays mean that the UK will either stay in the EU or have some arrangement in which we stay in the customs union. My sister is already thinking about having an Irish passport alongside her British one and I know others are thinking the same just in case the whole thing goes wrong."

"1. Knew of him throughout high school through mutual friends (we went to different high schools). One night I took my friends food to “randomly” pick a number to prank text - secretly picked his because I thought he was hot haha &amp; from then we became friends and eventually start dating.

2. He is hands down one of the most caring guys I’ve ever known in my life. His loyalty and devotion to me throughout our entire relationship - even now. Also he is an extremely hard worker. 

3. Mostly everyone in our families were supportive. The only struggle was my mother in law - whom I have a great relationship with today. She just felt we were too young and not “mature” enough. But mostly everyone else in our families said quite the opposite. I think she was projecting her first engagement in her 20s that she called off because she wasn’t ready. My dad and step mom were kind of negative about it but I don’t have a close enough relationship to then to care. 

My husband and I also had been dating for 3 years before getting engaged. Most weren’t shocked that we got engaged - actually our families were involved in the proposal."

"I have never really been a person that sleeps tons

but yeah, this is STRANGE that I have actually been able to forget that I havent slept. Not because I am foggy or losing it, but just cause I dont feel it at all. So getting carried away in conversation, with my usual ""wonderful"" memory I am carried away from that fact. And the slight tired feeling actually completely goes away if I forget how long I have been up.

I feel like I imagine a person would feel half way through the work day. I could sleep, I think. but I havent felt a tired-ness worthy of it. just like a ""yawn at 8 am"" Kinda feel at most.

But I havent felt tired in a while, so I am making this assumption as a shot in the dark.
I also havent felt emotions consistently (I did for a few minutes a few days ago) in nearly a year but were about 2 months off that anniversary.
Thats a STARK contrast to me before my birthday (the day it changed)"

"For example, in 7th grade history, we learned about a war between Vietnam and another country. Vietnam won and the enemy general was captured, our king feared further conflict so he decided to send the general back via ship, that’s how it went on in the textbooks. In reality, the king actually sent someone to swim below the ship and poke holes in it. The ship sank and the general died, after that our king just pulled a “oh, he died in an accident so it wasn’t our fault!”. I only knew of this information thanks to my grandfather"

"That’s fine, I’m always happy to answer questions. It’s better that people get informed opinions of all beliefs anyway.

1. The UK is far less disparate as a collection of states than the EU. Whilst each state has a different culture (and a different second language which isn’t in common usage most of the time), they are united in the vast majority of culture. The English and the Scottish are far closer to one another than they would be to the Serbians or the Italians. Britain has had 800 years of Parliament and c100 of democracy so I’d argue it’s fairly well suited for it.

2. (Slight generalisation based on the opinions of those I know), Brexit isn’t so much about the economy. We’ll probably see short term losses but providing that Britain can adapt properly and reach out to other nations for trade I think we’ll be better off in the long term. It’s true that the EU helps with trade negotiations and Britain won’t have that collective economic might, but it’s the world’s 5th largest economy with an extensive diplomatic network and soft power outweighing its size, so it’s pretty well placed to survive on its own.

3: I wouldn’t say that there was actually any particular ‘plan’ among leave supporting politicians, since the motivations for leaving were so diverse. Britain won’t turn in to a tax haven because the government has a hugely popular welfare state to prop up, but tax cuts and measures to boost productivity wouldn’t be that bad imo.

4: I’m in favour of leaving with a deal, but not May’s deal which was objectively awful and deprived us of most of the benefits of leaving whilst keeping the downsides in order to minimise short term losses. The story of her negotiations is one of wasted opportunities, and largely frictionless trade could have been kept at the Irish border with simple solutions such as customs pre-clearance etc had a tougher negotiator been in there. I’m not a fan of Trump, but even he could have done a better deal imo.

5: I would rather Scotland didn’t leave, but it won’t be a tragedy to me if it does. The nationalist movement there has been strong for decades, and Brexit is another opportunity for the SNP to push its agenda, so questions over independence are larger than simply a Brexit related issue. I don’t want a hard border in Ireland, but a backstop isn’t required to solve it. In our day and age there are a large number of technological solutions to solve it and, although they would take some time to implement, this could have been easily provided for within a transition period. Although it is a valid concern, the issue was weaponised by the EU as a way to keep Britain closely tied to it, and an intransigent pro-remain civil service didn’t help (they ignored the findings of one of their own reports that said a technological border was a viable solution, for example).

Hope this clears some stuff up and have a nice day!"

"Torn between aiming to be a nurse in the ER or being a nurse in a psych department. I have always loved psychology since I was younger.

I can function pretty well in “professional” environments. Like in school, I’m fine. I can function well enough to get my work done, which helps me make friends SOMETIMES. But once work time is over and it’s just normal social interaction? I fall apart. I think it’s because in school, I know what I’m doing so I’m more comfortable. In a job I’m trained for, I would be comfortable because I know what I’m doing and belong there. So I think waitressing or being a nurse would push me out my comfort zone a little because while it’s a work environment, I still have to communicate effectively with new people constantly cycling through.  And hopefully that’ll bring me out my shell. Plus I just like helping people and there’s no way I can become a doctor now, like my original goal.

No pets, they aren’t allowed in my apartment. But I would love a dog. My fiancé says he wants one too once we move sometime next year."

"I'm speaking about Saint-Petersburg, but anyway if you're looking for spicy food try and find something Korean you'd not be disappointed."
Does your whole field of vision get taken over by the color or just the thing making the sound? And if it is your whole field of vision how opaque is it?
It was a Chevy Colorado
"I’m not talking about rural areas exclusively or even geographic area. London is set apart as a city in its population and culture. London and Sheffield are both cities, but are still very different, hence why there’s often so much talk of the ‘London bubble’. Again, I’m not saying that the views of Londoners aren’t valid, just  that they aren’t representative of the majority of the country both rural and urban. 85% of the English population may live in cities, but only 1 in 6 live in London, so I’d call the majority of people who don’t live in it pretty vast. Much like someone from England couldn’t claim to be representative of someone who lives in Scotland, even though it’s technically the same country, the UK, someone from London can’t claim to represent the views of England. It’s got nothing to do with rural/urban, because it’s about London versus the rest of England."
So it was not a specific issue? Just a mutual disdain for the other?
The dungeon master is the one that tells the story for the players and describes what's going on
"The way you are framing your comment makes it sound like the country could be divided into London-sized geographic squares, each counting equally. That's absurd. Nearly 1 in 6 people living in England live in London, and ~85% of the English population lives in urban areas. Forgetting culture, economics, and politics, just by sheer population you couldn't say London is *nothing* like ""the vast majority.""

I'm not attacking those who live in rural spaces, mind you. I live in a country which does tend to value rural and non-urban spaces. It's called Scotland and it's ace - you should come visit! I'm just saying that land, while important, is not the same as people. Two farming families might own as much land as a few thousand live on in a really dense place, but that doesn't mean any two of those city-dwellers are less English just because they hold less space than the farmers."
"Nah, it has a pretty good definition in law. 99.99% of people manage not to break that law there just fine."
What about tom hiddleston then ever yanked to him
Did you feel well rested when you woke up?
"Well it has two parallel sides of bread that are touching the sausage, so it counts as a sandwich in my book. I can see how people think that it wouldn't be.

A wrap has always been a sandwich to me. You find it right next to the sandwiches in gas stations, it fits my logic. A taco is the same. Even though I don't really like tacos, it still fits my rule and I think it deserves to be a sandwich."
I’d love to be a financial advisor for a corporate company!
"Thats not the point.

Homosexuality is about two people who know what theyre doing. Pedophilia is not. While i agree thats its important we talk about, its also important to protect the children"
What does porn sound like?
"Strangest thing I've seen was right out the window of my apartment: a weird amorphous and slightly anthropomorphic blob hovering in the sky and moving back and forth for about five minutes (with and against the wind). Wasn't the only one to see it, and still not sure what it was.

If you mean on a trip... I ran into what I assume was the remains of a Thule campsite in Baffin Island.  Something about it triggered a feeling I would best describe as horror."
"I don’t think he had me in mind, I’m pretty sure our argument happened afterwards. 

What personally bothers me is people who reason with others when it’s convenient for them. I had a post about cops he didn’t like so he starts making fun of my self harm post out of no where. But with other redditors (like you) that are unproblematic to his standards, mental illness and self harm are serious matters.

Be consistent. Don’t tell people to cut themselves because you have different beliefs or you’re pissed off."
