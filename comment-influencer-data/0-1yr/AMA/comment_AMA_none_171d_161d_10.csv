Up until recently the hardest thing was being around people who expected me to know how to take care of myself as soon as I got out. I got locked up for a year when I was 17 then 19 for 24. All together 17 years in seg. So mentally I'm like a teenager in some ways. I never did anything for myself before. I hadn't even closed a door in 24 years. (I'm always leaving the fridge open and walking away haha) I don't understand how my friends and family expected me to know how to pay bills or how to download apps on my phone. I had no idea what YouTube was or anything like that. Now life is way easier with her in the picture. She teaches me new things every day. If it weren't for her I'd be back in prison for sure.

"I became a janitor because after I graduated I was going nowhere in life, and a childhood adult who was alway in my life was the big boss. 

As far as most interesting conversation; somehow a group of boys didn’t know I was working next to them as they talked about being worried Boy A his girlfriend pregnant. All the while, skipping class smoking weed in the bathroom. 2 hours later, I overhear a group of girls taking about a similar story, out two and two together and figured they were the boyfriend and girlfriend. Turns out girlfriend was using a fake pregnancy to keep the boyfriend from smoking weed.. go figure."

Initially I was arrested for forging a few checks and stealing cars. I was in the state jail waiting to be sentenced when I saw a hole in the fence. Two guys jumped out and I saw the bar across the street and thought 'fuck this place'. I was on the run for 3 hours. I was a fool back then.

"That's a tricky one. Most noteworthy events are pretty funny. Only one story sticks out in my mind right now:

A pool cleaner was using a machine to clean the floor around the edge of the pool, he lost control of it and the main body of the machine fell over the ledge. He and three others were trying to pull it back up by the handle but it was too far gone. It sunk to the bottom of the pool and could be seen still driving itself around trying to clean the pool floor. It's not as funny in a retelling, but everyone in the control room was pissing themselves laughing."

It's still so confusing. Luckily I started dating someone who has taken the time to show me the way. Most people just wanted to do everything for me cus it was easier.  I just learned how to use an air fryer and turn on a treadmil as a matter of fact. Up until 5 months ago I couldn't even reverse the camera on my phone. I don't think I'll ever learn to use a computer though. I don't like it. Too many boxes.

"Hey this is the girlfriend writing! I think it's easier for me to answer the mental health thing. He has never been evaluated since being out. Nor has he researched anything. He shows so many signs of PIS (Post-Incarceration Syndrome)  Anger for no reason over small things he doesn't understand (he usually just sits in silence with a confused mad look.  No violence thank God), he used to drink non stop up until a few months ago. He has paralyzing anxiety when we go out. He can't look people in the eye for very long. I order for him at restaurants cus it causes him so much stress.
He has come a long way in a few months. His irrational fears, like me leaving him while he's at work even though we aren't mad at each other, are starting to go away. He stopped giving me his debit card and cell phone when we go to parole since he always thought he'd be arrested for absolutely nothing. At first I almost left him but he just needed someone to help him and guide him. We were pen pals in prison but only friends so I moved to help him with his life and ended up falling in love. He just wants to be loved like everyone else. His coworkers are ex cons and act very similar.

Oh he read lots and lots of books. He had a radio. He made money by betting on sports teams. He said he almost always won. We're gonna have to sign up for fan duel soon so we can make some money. Haha "

2. Construction worker fell onto a sheet of glass he was carrying and sliced his wrist open. Severed an artery, lost a lot of blood very quickly.

Took me maybe an hour tops to clean it all up.

"It bothered me at first. I was right out of high school when I started and obviously had an ego. Growing up you become more mature and realize a job is a job. Money is money. A lot of the kids relate to me because I’m young so they arnt as harsh. I’m a supervisor now and it’s sad seeing how they treat the older custodians.

In the end, it’s like the casual job title is janitor, the professional job title is custodian."
I was on the second story of the jail in the rec yard and there were no guards out there. I watched two guys slip out through a hole in the bottom of the fence and jumped off the building. So I was thinking for a second about the bar across the street and how  I'd love to have a beer. I also knew there was a pay phone right by the jail so I thought I'd call my buddy to come get me.  But as soon as I got out I just took off like a bat out if hell. Three hours later the dogs found me. They shoved my face right into an ant hill. When I saw the Warden he was talking shit so I told him to go fuck himself. He punched me right it the throat. It sure shut me up quick let me tell you.

They can do whatever they want to you. Especially back then. I watched my cellie get murdered the first day I went to prison. Guts spilling out as he looked up at me. The guards took me and had me standing outside in the freezing cold for hours in just boxers. Kept me in solitary for two weeks trying to get me to snitch. When they finally gave up they sent me back to the wing where the murderers were. I was just a scrawny little kid too. Thank God they never came after me. The guards don't protect you. The more we fight with each other the better. If we all got together and fought the guards nobody could do a damn thing. They are told to provoke us. It keeps the attention off of them. Oh and I found out later that dude was killed over some shower shoes.

I think I've seen every kind of porn there is within that first month of me getting out. Even things I didn't wanna see just because I was so blown away by it being right there instantly for free. Before I got locked up we had VHS tapes and had to be all discreet about it. It was a big deal just to get one. Haha. Also I started getting all of these strange messages saying they were girls in my area that wanted to sleep with me. I guess I was clicking on all these links that knew my email. Everyone still laughs at me for that. But it blew my mind. "

I'd listen to my radio and read books. For a few years I'd just sit and stare at the wall not thinking about anything. Every once in a while I'd get a letter. Sometimes I'd help pass out commissary and contraband with my line. My cell had a big ass hole in it so I'd get some shit from the mexicans when I threw it to their buddies down the way. Talk to some dudes through the wall. My cell was only 9 by 5 feet. I gave up on working out after a few years in seg. "

Awe thank you! I actually was really struggling with finding myself when I started helping him. He has completely changed me as a person. I am so loving and understanding and constantly trying to better myself. It was a win win really. Him and I were never supposed to meet.

Yeah it's fucked up. My cell was 9 feet by 5. Just to be clear I was in seg for 3 years and then later for 14. More people should be protesting the way they treat us. It's like we're animals. I've seen them put a rich young kid who got arrested for selling a bit of weed into a cell with a murderer who was three times his size and not his race. The boy was missing for three fucking days. The big dude was fucking his dead body under the bed the entire time. Man that caused some crazy shit to go down. I ended up getting transferred just cus I was in that wing and I was the same race as the kid. 
"Had the same thing. 

I was 18 when i worked as a janitor (uni has different vacations than highschool over here, worked there a month in the summer between coming from HS and going to uni).

Ranged from students hitting on me, thinking i was some kind of shy/anti-social new kid. To teachers being utter assholes and me being able to put them on their place.

Knew a lot of guys that were actually still going to school there, so it was a lot of fun."
You should go on r/drunk and ask everyone to celebrate for you.
Yes sometimes
Hell yeah. I was in a 9 by 5 cell 23 hours a day. I could touch both walls without even stretching my arms all the way out. They didn't put me in seg until years later.  These dudes escaped and killed a bunch of prison guards. A few weeks later I was in the wrong wing of the prison cus this dude owed me money. I was waiting outside of his cell and a new guard realized I was in the wrong wing. I wouldn't tell them why I was over there. I actually have two escape charges cus I slipped out of a cop car while he was in the store. So they saw the two escape charges and they put me in seg for a year. I just figured it would only be a year.  Every year after that they denied me to go back to population. They said I was too high of a risk. One time the guy actually approved me to go back. I was all ready and going that day and then they got a phone call saying I was denied again. That really fucked me up. 
Okay to break it down my mom was going to carry us cuase she is 5 years younger but was unfortunately unable to. So then my momma carried us and ofc gave birth to us. My sperm donor is different from my sisters 
Seen anything happen to someone that would be really embarrassing if they knew you saw it?
Ever seen people have sex?
"Ha! No. Usually just browse Facebook/Reddit/Youtube/Ebay on my phone while glancing up at the monitors every couple minutes. If something is happening, it's usually the boots on the ground who alert us, and we just get a visual on the situation and track back to get some additional context. Otherwise it's pretty easy to spot when something is out of place.

I do try to do a full detailed sweep every 10-30 minutes depending on risk factors."

"Most of the control rooms I've worked record in excess of 3 months worth of footage from hundreds of cameras operating 24/7/365. It is impossible to manually delete anything that has been recorded within that rewind period.

"Hey girlfriend here! I sort of had him trying the voice to text recently. The only problem is that he has a super southern accent. Google can't understand him. Haha Actually when we were pen pals I used to send him letters doing that. Feels like so long ago! If the letter is gonna get written it will be because I organized it all.

Girlfriend here! Yes I've seen that. He won't watch tv or videos. I read that that is a symptom of Post-Incarceration Syndrome but I will check it out. I was thinking of trying to make us a channel. I may write a channel to interview us and maybe we could get paid? That would be nice. I'm surprised no one has contacted him to run tests on him since it's not very common and the damage it causes. I did just read that 60% of people released from prison go back to  within their first year. Not him! Yay!
I have two moms and two dads. The moms are together and the dads are together. My mom and dad were together when I was young and then I guess both realized they were gay?
I never got bullied just kids asked a lot of questions I'm also in Canada where I feel it's way more accepted. 
"I shared this with someone earlier. 


There is a triple risk model that most researchers believe in. It involves these three happening at once. (1) a vulnerable infant, (2) a critical developmental period in homeostatic control, and (3) an exogenous stressor(s).
A vulnerable infant would be considered one born early, or one born with the brain defect that 30% of babies who die of SIDS have. A critical development period is self explanatory, but most of those happen within the first 6 months they are what people call the “leaps.” And exogenous stressors could be the baby becoming overheated, a major change that has caused stress, chin to chest position, soft sleeping surface, a cold, a respiratory infection, etc. 

If all of those things combine, they hypothesize that this sis what causes it. 

My son was born 3 weeks early, but weighed 7 lbs 11 oz. He was incredibly healthy. Ate like a champ. Slept all night. Was never sick. And weighed 15 pounds and was 24 inches long when he passed. We had no idea. Which is why it was so shocking. It was the last thing I ever thought about. He just started daycare two days prior and it made him very tired. But other than that he was perfectly normal and had a perfectly normal night with us before we went to sleep. 

I have as 7 1/2 month old now and she is totally fine. We did everything exactly the same with her. 

When people say unsafe sleep is what causes SIDS that’s a lie. It’s a contributing factor, but for most infants it doesn’t matter. I’ve met moms of SIDS babies whose babies were wide awake when it happened and just stopped breathing. No sense of panic. Nothing. They just stopped breathing. Some were able to be revived, but could never be taken off life support and sustain life. It’s a horrible thing that people don’t know a lot about. 

I have anxiety and I refused to read about it when we got pregnant because I didn’t want to be scared. I said it would never happen anyway. And then it did. So I knew nothing before hand. I thought I was protecting us by not allowing my anxiety to steal happiness away. "

"Best part? I actually did enjoy the sexual component. I had never had anal sex before this, so it was mostly a pleasurable experience (even if I was tied up during it).

Worst part was probably having to be completely naked for 24 hours. I'm a self conscious person, so it took some getting used to. Also being used as a foot stool. At my age that hurt like hell."

I deleted my Facebook about a year ago after I saw certain friends of mine creating their own personal echo chambers and literally ending real-life friendships as a result.  
"My favorite part: is getting helped from students. Many times I will be pulling a trash bag and a kid will run over and just hold the lid for me. Little things like that go along way in your day. 

Least favorite part: puke on carpets. We can clean anything without a machine but if it involves puking on a carpet we have to go across campus and get our very heavy machine. It’s more of an annoyance, I really do love my job."
"Just continue to be the person that you have been. You can throw subtle hints out that they may be having a problem (that's what it took for me to finally realize I needed to change) or just sit down and have a casual talk about it. 

Whatever you do DO NOT corner them and have a intervention type confrontation. They do not work and will more than likely end up with the end of that friendshio.

One big thing is the person has to want to get clean. The best thing you can do as a friend is convince them that they want to be clean, not force them to do it.

Keep in mind everyone is different and my advice is based purely off my experiences. Different people and different drugs have different addictions. "
