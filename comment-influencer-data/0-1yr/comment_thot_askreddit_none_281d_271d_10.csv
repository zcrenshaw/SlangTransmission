"My ex posted a picture of her in her underwear to a band fan page for ""Thot Thursday"" after we had a conversation where I said I'm not comfortable with her doing that and she called me controlling.

She texted me drunk from a party complaining that the guy she was flirting with started talking to somebody else and she felt rejected, but I NEED to understand because it's just validation and she wouldn't have done anything with him.

I considered both of those acts to be very borderline."
