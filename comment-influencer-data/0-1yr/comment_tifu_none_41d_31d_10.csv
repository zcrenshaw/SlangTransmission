Any insult or does it have to be particularly hurtful?
"I thought it was an autocorrect too, but it turns out insult in medicine means damage to tissue or organ. TIL. Also it’s funny OP didn’t know you were indirectly calling him out."
"""He might've been your father, but he wasn't yet daddy."""
"Brain injuries are heterogeneous- meaning the same injury would produce different results in different brains. The magnitude of the insult is thought to be related to the symptoms that I mentioned above. I know some labs do some biomechanical studies of how much force is required to cause certain injury severities, but I don’t know much about it. In my lab, we consider injuries a concussion if the person exhibits any of the symptoms I listed above. You can also use things like the Glasgow coma scale to assess more severe injuries."
So did OP's date.
But I cried the whole time
"For real, he was really pulling on the heart strings until that TL;DR. A total curve ball."
Idk.. I'd say people who break promises are dicks. getting a divorce just one month after promising to be with someone for life is a dick thing. Getting a divorce after one month and pushing all blame onto your partner is even more of a dick thing. Getting a divorce after a month with your pregnant partner is an EXTREMELY dick move.
Now I'm questioning whether or not my dad is my real dad. Ugh. My mom's a hoe 😩
My office is dead silent right now and I’m full on snorting at this TL;DR
"Tbh the fact that, a TIFU post makes you dig that deep makes me think you're insecure as hell man. I like how you picked my purposely cringey picture and not my newest one cause you know I slay."
"Well tbf, shouldn't the characters have already been developed for the most part by the time you watch that movie?"
"your dad is the man that loved you and raised you, dna tests are cheap if you want to know for sure."
"Literally it's NOT their job to tell you what to do. Both morally &amp; legally. 

He either didn't go to the appointment or he's making up his own story regardless of what was actually discussed in the session.

Eitherway, he's a real dick."
I personally vote comically oversized spiked dog collar with an equally comically oversized laser-etched tag.
The cheating part did that for me
I was thinking that since she mentioned he's a good actor...
"Mind you I mentioned the entire Cinematic universe, not a specific movie.

Certain movies mean certain transitions or cementation for some characters.

Like how in Guardian if the Galaxy 2, Rocket had issues to resolve; then afterward in Infinity War and Endgane we see that he has indeed accepted how much his team meant, mean to him."
"If missing a word is a sign of a concussion, I’m fucked"
"Your housekeeper is an ass for eating your food, but the way you talk about her is so dehumanizing"
It was also the only porn he had. He had a hard time coping that he had wanked to her for three years. It damn near wrecked him.
"Why should they show compassion for someone who broke trust multiple times, stole from them, and then proceeded to be half naked all over their property. Sorry but I would not be nice either."
"Wait, are you telling me adding insult to injury is just how most things medically happen?"
I hope you have a new house cleaner. The fact that she disobeyed your orders and completely disrespected your house by eating (which is stealing) your food on multiple occasions. She got what she deserved and maybe she will think twice about pulling that shit again. But who knows what else people do in your home when you aren't there if she is willing to keep breaking your trust like that. Karma !
"Honestly, true. I would never do a DNA test now that I think about it - I bet that crossed his mind during the divorce but he loved us still and cared for us. He even put himself in substantial debt so I could go to Eating Disorder treatment - I think I need to stop talking to my mom."
"This attitude has nothing to do with the therapist unless hes like the worst shrink in the world. This guy is a weak dude looking for an excuse to bail, clearly freaked out by the baby situation and becoming an adult."
"He might not be your father, but he is your daddy."
I’m publishing my PhD dissertation on brain injury. I assure you this is the currently accepted definition.
"""Today I fucked Myself"""
"Now we’re left wondering what he said to get so many awards. It’s like when you hear people laughing hysterically over a joke, but they won’t tell it to you."
Even the fire?
"No matter what the genes are in your blood, your dad is your real dad. It's best to think of it like this, because he was there for you, cared for you, and made you into the person you are today. Even if you had another biological father, that doesn't in any way change that he's your real dad."
They dressed up as Han and Leia for halloween.
Think we overshot a little bit
"He's still the asshole honestly, she's very recently pregnant, but he was going through this depression and suicidal thoughts/attempt at the same time he was knocking her up"
"That's what I thought; he wants out and is making excuses. I suffer from depression and have a horrible habit of getting overly frustrated with my partner and even hate him sometimes, but I also recognize that it's the depressed part of me looking for a scapegoat and a person to blame. It's ridiculous to blame someone for your lifelong depression even if you've known them as long as you've been depressed. 

Any good therapist also won't give actual advice on what to do with your life, instead they'll advise you on how to figure it out for yourself, i.e. pros and con charts. Their job is to help you figure yourself out, not to tell you what to do. This guy is just seeking an excuse and creating his own problems."
"Really? I just watched infinity war and that was completely void of character development. I'll agree that for some. admittedly, I haven't watched all, but it's not a Marvel-wide guarantee."
Pro tip: don’t let her see your TL;DR
Let's hope Sarah (changed) isn't on Reddit and sees this thread
"I saw the subject of ""knocked the fuck"". I assumed this was by a girl who got ""knocked the fuck UP""."
"FBI, open up."
I would keep planting food with weird shit in it like a bunch of laxatives. Maybe even set up a nanny cam for the things that aren't apparent. Ugh people using and going through my things totally irks me. No clean house is worth that breach of privacy.
There have been cases where Wal-Mart has pressed charges against folks returning items they say they accidentally took. I know one person it happened to personally.
"It's not necessarily lying though. My recent ex-wife was in therapy and she was told that she needed to ""focus on getting herself better and not worry about other people's problems"". She took that to mean, ""leave her husband and not consider that her teenage son was having issues of his own and move out three months before school ended for the year."" She literally said that she wasn't going to worry that her kid was failing every class, was depressed and not going to school because she 'needed to focus on her own issues'.

I get it, she has mental issues but some therapies really need to tailor their therapy and not make it a one size fits all because they can start using it as an excuse. She didn't even tell her psychiatrist because he told her not to make any drastic changes in her life. I don't even know anymore. She's an adult and is still allowed to make her own decisions."
"I've met a couple of people who lie about what they and their therapists discuss, in order to manipulate other people, or excuse their own behavior. I imagine it must be pretty common. 

I've never known a therapist who just gave permission to give up on things. More often than not they try to help you develop coping mechanisms, so you can function at a nominal level; not admit defeat. My friend's wife would have you believe her therapist:

* Told her that her compulsive shopping is probably something that she'll never be able to change. Her husband just needs to accept.

* It's perfectly understandable to let the dishes pile up in the sink, because cleaning them exacerbates her anxiety.

It's a selfish, cowardly thing to do. Hiding behind your therapist. I'll bet OP's husband would refuse couples counseling. It seems to be a trademark of people who are lying to their therapists about their families, and/or lying to their families about their therapy."
"So am I. Despite feeling guilty, I was on crutches and am still saving to put a replacement tooth in."
"Reddit got me again
Spillin my fucking beer during work because of laughter... Shit"
Nope. Generally mild TBI has a loss of consciousness of 5 mins or less. Anything longer than 5 mins is considered more severe.
"I once got stuck behind Ted Cruz at DCA. We were in the TSA Pre check line and he was wearing these massive fucking cowboy boots which, of course, set off the metal detectors. So the TSA people told him he had to take them off and he kneeled down IN FRONT OF THE METAL DETECTOR and spent like 5 minutes struggling to take them off while the line grew behind us. So I can confirm that Ted Cruz is a certified dick. 

That's my fun politician encounter story."
Don't matter had sex.
"That was my exact thought. It seems people will say ""marry her"" or ""she's a keeper"" to any story on here. There's still no basis for understanding how she communicates her emotions/ feelings, how she handles stressful situations or obstacles in life, or how their families get along or their goals in life. I think people romanticize relationships (pun intended I guess) based on movies."
Start looking for a new job
"And then you post it online, for everyone else to see..."
"We had something similar happen somewhere around 13 years ago. 
TL;DR, Our 6 horses got out of their pasture while we were on vacation. They lead the cops on a small chase as they romped round our small, country town, until they almost got caught, and went home on their own. Later met one of the officers involved by chance, and she counted it as one of the most fun calls she was ever involved in.


Long version: a family friend owns horses, so we board our horses at her place. While we were on vacation with said friend, we had arranged for a mutual friend to stop in mornings and evenings to feed the horses and so on. About half way through the week, a call from the friend we had scheduled to stop in, saying that they had apparently escaped at some point, since there was a note from the police on the barn door when she arrived. 

Turns out the gate hadn't been latched properly, and what ensued was a herd of 6 horses going for a winter romp around town with police attempting to catch them. From what we were told, while the police were trying to box them in, the herd leader made eye contact with one of the officers, before charging and weaving past her squad car, with the other 5 following suit. Police followed them, and the horses just made their own way back home and into the pasture as if they hadn't just spent the last 40 minutes causing minor chaos. After that it was simple as closing the gate and leaving a note.

Fast forward to my senior year of highschool, 5 years ago. The co-op I went to was having g a sort of health and safety day where firemen and police showed up and gave a sort if seminar about basic stuff. While we were being shown the squad car of the officer, she was answering whatever questions we had. Someone asked her what the most interesting call she ever had was. She told two stories; one of them was her husband's experience when he got nailed in the face by a rotten strawberry by some idiot teen throwing them out of a car.  The second one she recounted, was the time she got to help herd a bunch of horses that had gotten loose one winter, and that she could have sworn the leader was going to jump over her squad car when he made eye contact with her. She was greatly amused when I informed her those were ours, and showed her a picture of the horses in question. 


We decided not to tell her that the idiot teen that beaned her husband in the face with a strawberry was my older brother.
Oh the glories of small town living."
"For those who missed it, long story short, OP's tinder date basically dropped him on his head while trying to spin him around during sex. There was a line involving him comparing her to Hulk Hogan, they continued, and the post ended with her accompanying him to the hospital because he's concussed.

OP told it better."
That’s.... not racist..

I still love him to death and can't imagine life without him. To top it off, I have full legal and physical custody, and his mom pays me child support.

Edit: he's 10, so there's no way I'm giving him up."
"He's not a dick because he wants out of the relationship. I mean, yeah he should have been more honest but being that honest is maybe one of the hardest things to do in life. I feel a lot of pain for OP and her situation but isn't it better to find out now then 1-10 years from now?

"I wouldn't ever get a DNA test unless I had to for medical reasons. 

We're in the age of information, that information is sold as a commodity to the highest bidders, yes that includes your genetic information. Cloud computing, data science, and machine learning methods are being leveraged to track everyone's thoughts and decisions, 1000s of companies have profiles on all of us and they want every last bit of data they can access.

Keeping your personal information secure and your digital hygiene clean should be a priority for everyone, if you don't understand why look at things like the citizen score system in china, that's just a first generation system which will be improved and copied in the the western world.

Information is more dangerous than ever before. If your genetic information falls into the wrong hands it might effect you for the rest of your life. Think insurance, especially if you live somewhere without free healthcare especially.

Teach your friends and family how to keep themselves safe in the future. And think about why you're getting a DNA test before you do it and if it's worth the potential consequences."

"It's possible this couple should not be together. But I also wonder if he's just being selfish. Or if there might even be another woman (very much not mutually exclusive to being selfish.) Unless you're really incompatible with the other person, you should be capable of loving them. It's a choice. And choosing not to love someone can be very selfish -- you made a promise to this person that you would be there for them for the rest of their life.

I feel bad for the OP and hope things work out. But it also sounds possible that you might be better off without this guy. If he's going to pull a stunt like this, it might be better if you don't wind up spending your entire life together. Dunno."

"Thanks! My dad called me back and reassured it wasnt my fault. He thanked me, too. It's just the aftermath now that I'm dealing with. I definitely fucked up because I'm learning more and more from different family members that I didn't need to know. Apparently my mom started a fight at the alter the DAY OF THE WEDDING and almost called it off - looking through their wedding album I realised a lot of the people in the background pictures look ""unamused"""
"No he did not,  such an unnecessary comment. OP is not responsible for his mothers’ actions!"
Just do your best to be there for your father. Maybe seek out therapy or see if you can do some group therapy with your father and siblings at some point. Not communicating is what started this so voice your fears and concerns. Trust me your dad has his own just dont pry if hes not ready to voice them. Start working up to forgiving yourself and maybe even your mother at some point. Work on you and your family is all that matters at this point.
I'm glad. I wish you and yours the very best. You deserve it and more.

From what I have read on Reddit over the last years (German here, not American!), the benefits are not only monetary, but also that one gets to live outside of the barracks with his/her family.

There are quite some subreddits and memes referring to such wives (they're commonly called ""dependapotamus"" or ""dependas"")."

"As a former military member with a couple deployments, hearing this shit makes my blood boil. I hate all cheating, but there’s something particular about a military spouse cheating while their partner is away that’s just the worst to me. This goes both ways though, it’s super fucked up when the person who is deployed cheats on their spouse while they have someone at home waiting for them. Your dad seems like a solid dude though"
And then 11 years later find themselves married with 2 kids because they never had the stones to break it off.
"I actually did have one say this to me once. Left immediately and never looked back to be fair 🤷🏽‍♂️

Edit; didn’t make sense at first"

"Haha, I'm sure you're dad would have figured it out too even if you kept quiet. It's not like you can live with a guy for however long and then have everyone pretend it never happened XD"
"As they say, it is what it is!  Been like 25 years since my parents split so a lot of it is water under the bridge.  Tbh, it's been that long since it's happened and it's now weird when my parents have a civil conversation as for the first like 10 years or so, my dad couldn't even be in the same room as my mum (likely felt guilty as he hadn't just lied to us, it was also his parents, siblings, friends etc!)."
"Hahaha! Fuck!! Good catch - I’ll give you a bonus story detail as a gift - I was wearing a red t-shirt when I went out there, and one of the kids called me Ronald McDonald!!! Love the random insults kids come out with. I’ve been randomly chuckling about that all evening ..."
"Well there is a rule in place for that, but only applies if both people are in the military. It’s against the UCMJ and they can be prosecuted for it. It’s difficult to prove though and usually just results in 1 person being quietly given a general discharge. It is ridiculously common though. I used to think there was something about being in the military that attracted that kind of person, which felt kind of dark. Eventually I realized the much darker truth, which is the only reason that military members and their spouses cheat so much more often is because they are more frequently put in situations where they can. If everyone had to spend 6+ months away from their spouse every couple years, people would cheat way more often. That then just becomes the normal for a lot of them, and they cheat more generally. I knew a dude who was in my squad and was my roommate while deployed, and he cheated on his wife with another woman who was in our squad. But his wife was deployed on a different squad but to the same base at the same time. She was in the same dorm building as the woman he was cheating with. I knew her before this too and she was a great person, I couldn’t fuckin believe this guy. People are ass"
Or maybe don't make a serious commitment like marriage if your unsure you want to be with the person?
Hurray for the original!

You didn't cause shit. Children aren't the problem and can't ever be the problem. Its between the parents.
It is and it isnt. I fucked up in a good way by finding out who my mom really is as a person.
My stepson quoted this to me once. He’s a great kid.
"Your mom is a lot like my mom. She cheated on my dad through chat logs though she claimed she never met the men in person (I think otherwise). This was like 2003, I was 4. I saw in my your comments that your mom was a manipulative woman and my mom honestly was the same way as well. She'd talk me into giving her my Christmas money that other family members gave me so I could help her buy groceries and stuff. Being around 9/10 I did it because it made me feel good to help her. I learned later in life that her actions were for personal gain. 

Thankfully my dad raised me, though he married a very toxic woman 6 months after the divorce was finalized (it took almost 2 years to serve my mother papers since she kept running from them), I'm probably a lot more well behaved than I would have been if my mother had custody. She handed it over to my father without a second thought. 

I don't know if you have her in your life now, but I understand how rough it can be having a mom like that. My mother comes and goes as she pleases and still tries to beg me for money that I won't give her, but my therapist and I came to the conclusion that she thinks about herself so much that she doesn't know how to parent a child. 

I wish you and your sister the best though."
"The joys of asking parents.

&amp;#x200B;

I've asked my parents a few times why my two brothers lived with my mom and her new husband and I was with my dad and his new wife.  I was with my brothers and mom before she remarried.  They always skirted the issue directly etc.

Dad passed away 2 years ago and mom was now in a  home, more because of health reason.  She was there mentally, most of the time. But she would let things slip over the year of stuff I knew she wouldn't normally say as it wasn't meant for my ears.  Anyway, we had a good visit once and lots of talking about the past etc and she casually mentioned that my maternal mom's husband didn't like me and made her choose between me or him.  Guess who went to live with dad."
Ur mom probably cheated on her second husband too haha
I don't understand why people think their children will help them keep their dirty secrets.
"I have a similar story almost exactly. My parents divorced when I was 8 and my sister was 4. Before it happened, we had been driving past a neighborhood with my dad and I pointed to a house saying, ""Mom's friend lives there."" My dad was like ""What friend?"" and then my sister and I told him about our mom's male ""friend"" who she often visited while leaving us in the car. My dad later comes to find out that my mom was cheating and they divorced soon after. I don't remember any of this besides the initial divorce but my dad's told me the story many times.

I guess the moral of the story here is that kids *do* notice things and are a lot smarter than people tend to take them for."
"I almost fought my mother in law because she forgot my wedding shoes. The shoes I reminded her to grab via text message, that she “ignored because I figured it was for someone else”, when she’s the one that offered to keep my shoes/dress so my husband wouldn’t see. She also misplaced my wedding straps/tie so yeah that was fun. She’s much better now though, she realized my level of crazy is much higher than hers."
I'm curious about the week that your mom disappeared. Do you know where she went and why?

Thank you! Might take a while tho ^^
"My parents' divorce was finalized when I was 14. They separated when I was 12. 

When I was 18 I asked my dad a bunch of questions about a supposed half-sister and found out I had one, and my parents split because I woke my dad up one night around 2 am because I was worried that my mom wasn't home yet. 

They got back about dawn and a few weeks later they separated. Turns out my dad had found her at a former friend's house...

So I feel ya OP.

"Yes, I did wait 30 days before I sent them the money back. Did not hear back from them even once. I don't think they cared too much but it was my own little victory to treat them back the same way they treated me."
"This happened about eight months ago but the after math is still the same. We got our kitten six weeks after being born. The first few nights she would not stop meowing. Since I am the stay at home dad she bonded with me the fastest. She always fell asleep on on my leg at night and since I didn't want to shun her away and think her master didn't want her I let her have free roam to do what ever.

A few months later she won't stop meowing. It lasted for a week. We thought maybe she felt alone or wanted different food. We tested everything we could think of like if she was in pain, but nothing. Well about a week later she stopped. Two and a half weeks go by and she starts again. This lasted a few days then another two in a half weeks later she starts and this time it's super bad. She wasn't letting us get any sleep at all or peace throughout the day. Then it all became clear when she got in position to be mated. She was in heat.

I guess maybe I'm uneducated in cats because to me a three month old kitten going into heat sounded very strange. Well we call the vet to get her spaded and the next opening was two months out. She was literally going into heat every few weeks. What fucking cat does that!?

My wife and kids were gone. I was laying in bed listening to music on Alexa while playing my 3DS since I had nothing better to do. Here comes our cat... meowing. I couldn't tell at her for being in heat but I had to think of something. I started to scratch her tail end thinking that might relieve it some. It made it worse.

She lays down on her back and just keeps going and going. So the brilliant idea comes in my head. If I rub the fur down there without touching anything else I might be able to calm her ass down. Very awkwardly I put my hand to a fist because I didn't want my fingers to go in somewhere and I start moving my fist in a vibrating manor on her pelvic area. Those meows get deeper and more aggressive sounding until she lets out the weirdest sound I ever heard a cat let out and her legs start shaking.

Right then my initial thought was...I just gave my cat an orgasm..I just molested my cat. I didn't get no sick pleasure from it I was just trying to get her to calm down...and it did. After that she didn't meow for the rest of the day. A few days later she was back to get normal self but something was off. She was way more clingier than normal. I wasn't about to do that shit again. That was out of Mercy, no way was it becoming normal.

So after this and even after the surgery, she will not let me close the door anywhere. She always has to have her eyes on me and she will only sleep near or on me. I can't get a break. It's like a crazy ex girlfriend thing. She even starts getting upset if me and my wife cuddled. Right now as I'm typing this I have an eight pound cat on my hip and she's actually spooning my leg.

I tried to break her from this but she'll start acting distant for a few days then she won't leave me alone. Masturbating is fucking awkward. She either claws at the door or just watches me. If you ever have a kitten. Don't give them a pity orgasm with your knuckles if they go in heat. I never had an animal act like a second girlfriend until now.

TL;DR: My cat kept going into heat so I rubbed her pelvic area until she had an orgasm. Now she won't leave me alone."
I think my solution is never going out in public again but that’s a great plan B!

Op got really lucky, and he’s out just in the nick of time.

"A very similar experience I had, but this was the regional manager in some important meeting with another regional manager for a company that we hosted services for. I was attending as I had some insight on some things.

When the meeting was over, my regional manager had heard about fistbumps, and how ""Hip"" this was. (To note: Each time we came into work we gave eachother fist-bumps because we're coool....)

He approached the guy in what I assumed was an expensive suit, and asked him if they should fist eachother. My mouth dropped and I tried to control the laughter, keep it inside. My chest felt strange. and I think if I had held it in any longer, the bloodveins on my forehead would pop. I burst out laughing from the face of shock of our partner's regional manager, and my boss looked confused as to why the sudden change of atmosphere in the room.

This happend 6 years ago perhaps, and I still chuckle at the thought.

TL:DR my boss asked in a meeting with a customer if they should fist-eachother."

"With this reaction I would be surprised if he even really went to the psychiatrist. Every first mental health appointment I have ever been on has been a ""getting to know you"" type of session.

No therapist I have ever heard of would tell someone they should leave their wife after one session."

"My mom did the almost the same thing. My dad was shipped off to war when I was like 12 (2006/07) and my mom cheated on him the whole time he was gone. He was gone for a year, they made him come home early because my mom had gone MIA and neighbors were starting to worry about me and my two little brothers. She ended up marrying the guy she cheated on my dad with. My mom is a serial cheater though, she's been cheating on my stepdad with different men for like 10 years now. Fucking Wild. Anyway, your parents divorce IS NOT your fault. Please do not blame yourself for your mother's narcissism. Best of luck."

OP doesn't mention that husband even knows she's pregnant though. It sounded to me like he didn't know.
"Two possibilities here IMO:

A) Husband wanted out of the marriage long before this and it was just a convenient excuse.

B) Your husband didn't realize how much he was going to hate seeing a psychiatrist and opening up to a stranger, he left there feeling angry, and is projecting that on to you because you encouraged him to go, so he's (incorrectly) blaming you for how shitty he feels."

you letting you dad know the truth was really the for the best.  i doubt he deserved to be cheated on while he is deployed. i dont think you fucked up.

"There's a special place in hell for guys like that... and an even worse place for the women that support them.  I'm not over here talking shit about your mom or anything, but I don't know that I would talk to her at all if I were you.  Yuck."
Your dad's awesome. Sounds like you still had a good upbringing. Show some love to your pa.
"As a husband and a masters student for counseling / therapy this breaks my heart. First and foremost, I'm so very sorry this happened. I don't know all the details of your situation, but I do know that living with somebody that has a mental illness is so challenging, and being blamed for it when you know you are not the source would be incredibly frustrating. I will say that the first session is meant to be assessment in most cases that I'm aware of (though, I'm still very textbook so far). Your husband was probably asked a lot of questions and may have come to that conclusion on his own, without the therapist intending to induce that conclusion. Most therapists will be very very careful to recommend specific actions on if their client should stay with or leave their spouse.

I hope you can talk him down, hopefully attend therapy with him and help him realize that you are not the source of his depression. Even if the relationship is not salvageable (I personally feel that most relationships are if both parties want it to be), it is very dangerous for him to view that big of a life change as the magic solution to his mental health. It's a total cop out, it won't solve his issue, and it's going to damage both you and your unborn child profoundly if he goes through with it. I'd strongly recommend some couples therapy if he can agree with it. Again, so sorry OP. This breaks my heart and I hope it turns around."

I'm the second (and last) and he split when I was little. Joe is the guy on my birth certificate. I don't know him. I only have one memory and it's a bad one. When I was young my mom was on and off again with ""uncle Jimmy"" who was young. My mom made a comment about Jimmy and I having the same mole... I had mine removed a few years ago, but all of a sudden, years later I'm like ** hold the phones ** and have ""pieced it all together"" I'm not in contact with my mom due to other reasons and haven't been in years. Neither Joe nor Jimmy are seemingly stand up guys so I'm like do I even want to know the truth and what good would it do? 😭 Still rotating on that. How would I even find out without either male DNA?"

The little update makes me happy
"That's so sweet! I think you're meant to be.
I knew I loved my gf when she casually leaned to the side while we were talking and just let it rip and then go on talking like nothing happend. Getting knocked the fuck out while screwing is in the same league, and we have  been together for 12 years and have two children..."
"&gt; insult to the head

heh"
"Nah the Hulk hogan thing was a joke, iirc op told the woman something like 'Well shit Hulk Hogan is here'

Edit: the post is back up, so you can get the context now lol"
"That’s it, married in a year....that story can’t go into nothingness and not be pass on to kids and grandkids....."
Still counts !
"Don't feel bad, she's the one that made a joke of it in the first place."
"Right?  Most guys I know if you offered them the opportunity to have a session of incredible sex but you are going to get knocked out, will take you up on that offer."
Thats a marriage story. Marry that girl.
"So that's a real story? I only saw it here - https://youtu.be/LuP1gyj3W64. I'd have assumed that if there was an original, it wouldn't end as gruesomely."
But she kept looking at her watch
Why did she try flipping you over? Was she about to peg you?
"""How was your night with your first tinder girl?"" 
You: ""It was a total knockout. Perfect"" 

Well the question is... How much of the night do YOU actually remember? O_o"
When training new guys how to wrap the tortilla I used to make a stupid joke about rolling blunts or joints. Depending on their reaction is how I know there're cool the the devils lettuce or not.
Fill it with weirder stuff. There's always weirder stuff.
"You found you a girl who can protect you, she's a keeper"
"Depends on the doctor. A lot of doctors dismiss people to get out of work. If a doctor ever doesn't want to run tests because ""it's probably"" whatever, tell them that you need it written in your chart that they recommended against tests.

They change their minds real quick.

Edit: this is especially bad for women, POC, or women POC. If you're a white dude, I can see why you haven't gotten this advice - but minorities, poor people, and disabled people are often dismissed when they have legitimate problems."
I have to wonder if people would be thinking this would be rapey if they fucked while *she* had a concussion.
Can you feel it brother?
"Bet his parents had some new foreplay to try out

I gotta know if his dad ever dressed up as Han Solo"
"This will be such a funny story later on to tell to friends, kids etc. I hope you all end up together!"
"/r/beetlejuicing

I'm sorry it took us three tries to get it right."
Sounds like a keeper bruh! Hard to find a good woman and a bodyguard.
 Bruh if anything I think you should stay with the girl. Ain’t nothing like getting knocked out mid-sex lmao.
y'all gonna be tellin ur grandkids this story lmao
"If this is only ""weird"" to him, I want to know what else happens in his life"
She deserved it.
The floor got more head than him.
Btw lowkey stalked you and your cat is GORGEOUS
Yea ok bud. Keep telling yourself that.
""" and his father was really fucking intrigued"" - oh, I bet he was."
This should read “TIFU by falling in love on the first date”. Amateur move
"Loctite, blue.  You need some.

Glad you're ok and btw, NICE SAVE!  That is not easy to recover from, and you kept the (oily) rubber on the road!"
You should be able to get the money back. I've done that before - it isnt hard
"Maybe you should tell her. Take whatever consequences she wants to dish out. Because if you ever crack and say anything, the longer you wait the more betrayed she might feel"
Lucky bastard.
WIFE HER RIGHT NOW OP
"I know, she ate the cookies without permission but the way he/she talks about her shows zero compassion."
"yea my son, come forth to the hulkster  so thou can hath your punishment, brother. 

Yeah checks out. I came writing that comment."
Most likely. Loss of memory is pretty common in more severe types of concussions.
That's one way to remember your first date
Can I join your ska band?
"Or Luke... Ya know, for the lightsaber..."
Or a Judo gi.
Do you mean Frankie Muniz?  I wasn't aware that Daniel Radcliffe had any concussions.
Yep! Sorry about the jargon. Sometimes it’s hard to break out of.
Don’t tell people how to live there life’s on a cell phone app maybe???
This 100% what I would do. Once insinuated my girlfriend was worthless when i meant priceless.... ugh.
"You must leave the words of your furry companion intact, they know best.♥"
"Hey, that could have been God at work. You really could have helped her, she was crying. Don't dwell on it, consider yourself a generous idiot."
"Well you should just get married because you aren't going to get a better, ""What was it like when you two first met"" story."
"you know what I reckon OP might be australian actually, sanger is more of an aussie term, we'd say sarnie and I just looked up dardy and it's australian slang for good, I think. Plus getting put off by the rain? Not very british. Slang is pretty similar though"
Yep I bet it'll be like Frank's Hot Sauce-you put that shit on *everything*.
Are you another One of those that have concrete bedrooms?
Best of luck with your new... uhhhh *BROTHER*
"So pure, I love this."
"""How did your first date go?"" ""Oh she yeeted me headfirst into the wall and knocked me out."""
"For me personally, it’s Suits!"
More or less!
Can't wait to hear the wedding toasts.
I
Get it to 6.9k and we'll win
K
*wipes with experience*
Nah you had it covered yourself all along mate
THIS IS LIKE A MOVIE I HOPE U GUYS GET MARRIED
It's gonna be tough to outdo that story... lol
"To be fair, sometimes they start out as friends. I waver on the poly side - my partner as well. Sometimes someone who is just a friend becomes more than that

In our case it's always cool with everyone and we respect each other. 

And kids don't ask as many questions if someone is a friend"
Young You is a real homie
Well...let’s just hope it’s not something like you said 😂
Jody destroys everything.
"Yeah I played a hand in my parents divorce at around the same age. Turns out waking up to the sounds of your mother being raped and beaten and mistaking the sounds my mother was making for laughter and going downstairs to see what was so funny was just about enough to seal the deal and get legal separation and divorce.

Early 90s Ireland divorce was an incredibly hard thing to get, turns out making your youngest see his mother being beaten and raped was just enough to get separation. A few years later divorce became easier to get and she took it as fast as she could even though the terms were incredibly unfair. I still remember not understanding what I saw but being asked by the barrister what I saw."
Dont be so judgy. It was wrong for her to cheat and she should have ended it with him. But when people are unhappy they are unhappy. Shes not a hoe.
"It sounds like it was her fault—you didn’t break up the marriage, you were just the guy who told your dad that some Jody was fucking his wife.

You should never feel bad for telling someone that their wife is shacking up with Jody while they’re out of town: If he didn’t know about it, he deserved to. On the other hand, if he’d been in on it you need to know that so you don’t put your foot in it."
Ya but it was not what I hoped that would happen and it's still embarrassing
"Don't be afraid to re-enter therapy in the future if you need it.  I'm a few years older than you and, while my mother didn't cheat, she was a raging narcissist and probably shares more than a few traits with your mom.

I'm on my second round of therapy.  The first one helped but the second one\*, which happened about 7 years later, has been life-altering.  Speaking for myself, the scars left by the emotional abuse were causing me pain that I had lived with for so long that I didn't even notice it anymore.  Purging yourself of that kind of pain can take time.  Don't be afraid to ask for more help if you find you're not over it.

\* Same therapist"
Mom was the problem bro
"In the nicest way possible, your mums a moron. 

Everyone knows kids can’t keep secrets. She was asking to be dobbed in, so don’t take any of this on your shoulders. Your dad sounds lovely."
Fuck those stupid ass family members. I would want my son or daughter to tell me.
"I am disgusted, yet intrigued"
So the third guess then.
Hoy me cagué
"couldve been much worse, you both handled it well enough i would say. you apologized for a minor fuck up and she acknowledged your ignorance in the moment and didnt make it a big deal. but the bottom line is her husband died and something else couldve easily gotten the emotions rolling. honestly youre good try not to worry too much about it. maybe if you find a good moment in the near future apologize once more and make sure shes ok, but only if you think it would be a good time and place to do so."
"I’d support it.

I’d support paying more in taxes to accomplish it, since I already pay the out of pocket maximum every year as is.

Rather it that in taxes and get free healtcare, than the system we currently have."
"Honestly though, what kind of idiot defaults to wasabi flavored anything when grabbing for someone else?"
Same
Paragraphs you lazy fucker!
I think this is the sweetest/cutest TIFU I’ve read in a long time.
Can't be America as no one would dare to go to the hospital for a potential concussion - that be 40k.
"You could have gone right to the hospital but you kept your prioritys straight.  Good sex, even when concussed, is worth it."
Why is she eating your food?  It's not respectful. It's unethical and immoral to me.
"while most of the time it's fine you should absolutely, definitely see a doctor. there can be multiple serious problems if you get hit so hard on the head that you get a concussion from it and the consequences range from being a vegetable to being dead. i would never take that chance."
"Symptoms persist for 18 years, and the infection may reoccur without lifestyle changes."
At least nobody got knocked up...
actually lol'd
"**""Those sperm were my brothers, and you ate them like animals MOM!""**"
"This is like a Larry David scene, I love it."
r/doesntmatterhadsex
"Well, I’m glad I am not a vegetable then, because my go to was always, go home, shut the blinds and sleep."
ASS MAN!!!!
Put me in the screenshot with an American Flag.
"This isn't a TIFU, but I'm okay with stumbling upon a wholesome story like this

Congrats man, she sounds like a nice girl!"
Especially RAW
CUMcussion
"When guys knock them out, it's sexual assault. When girls do it, we fall in love."
"You know, I thought you had been some fool who went inside for some sexytimes, but got knocked out by criminals then robbed/raped/organ-ripped. 

They had us the first half, not gonna lie"
"&gt; Little update: I think I'm in love and she's accompanying me at the hospital cause I am concussed

Are you in love, or is that the concussion talking?"
"Or you're just weak. They also didnt crash, just stopped abruptly."
"That's the opposite of a fuck up, I wish that happened to me"
"Dude could have just left with a ""dont use old bank bags next time"", chuckled, and moved on happy that it wasnt anything serious."
If you’ve been a bartender before you know to tip cash so you can help me commit minor tax fraud
Babies. The most expensive STD of them all.
"Absolute winner. Delete Tinder, you've successfully reached the endgame."
Not a fuck up at all you lucky b.... Congratulations
Wait... Where's the part where you fucked up??
"&gt;and I literally felt like my cock had infinite life, I could keep going FOREVER and never cum... It was awesome... for me.  


Wouldnt YOU want to climax  as well though?? 

Sorry about your dick"
Why can’t you live with her?
It was just a brag in the end lol
He hadn’t noticed the resemblance until I pointed it out. He couldn’t unsee it after that. It freaked him the fuck out.
better than twilight
"Unsurprisingly, things always went missing. I have no doubt that she stole her fair share of shit from us, but given the situation i described above, i was really powerless in the situation. My ex was fucking useless, and basically tolerated all of the house keepers nonsense purely because she had worked for the family for decades. I literally caught her sleeping in the guest bedroom during the ""workday"" more times than i can count. In fact, i had a house guest from out of town staying with us, and while we were all out during the workday, she came back first only to find her fast asleep in the guest room she was staying in."

I feel a happy update coming in 2 years like *Update: Today I married the love of my life.*
I'm not seeing the fuckup.
"I think it’s really important to review mild TBI- there’s a lot of misconceptions about mild injuries. Even though most people recover from them, you still should have examination. For years mild head injuries were considered fine by both the lay public and medical professionals. We’re now learning more and more that there are microscopic injuries (to places like white matter tracts) that occur even in mild injuries and can cause lifelong deficits. Furthermore, it was also thought that earlier brain injuries were better because if a child was injured early in development, the brain would be able to adapt. We’re finding the opposite now- most early childhood injuries result in deficits that last the lifetime of the child. Pm me if you want specific references :)"

"yep, you're right, i meant frankie muniz... afk going to the doctor myself."
Didn't this shit get banned from weekdays? I thought this was going to stop.
Today i fucked up?! No! Today i fell in love!
"Felt great all day, sorry to disappoint you."
"I had an accident like this with my bf, vo0ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppalso bawled my eyes out :"") This story is kinda cute though?! Although it must have been scary too.

My cat walked on my keyboard, hence the weird ""vo0p"", I'm not gonna delete it."
"Probably found a keeper. If my wife thought she killed me she'd probably start laughing and say something along the lines of, bout damn time."
wife this bitch ASAP
You finished while having a concussion? That’s some commitment right there
"Wait a minute, this has a happy ending!"
Almost universally a guy would take a bump like that to get laid.
So when's the wedding?
Careful dates like that are how you end up married!
Excuse me! I was reading this....😅
Jesus dude
"Unrelated but I genuinely did not know there were guys like you... That's nice, she's a lucky girl."
Somebody tell me what he said.
Damn haha just googled a picture. You learn something every day
She tossed you off the bed? Are you like 6 stone wet?
Wishing you a speedy recovery and a long relationship
Your post we are currently commenting on.
*Heavy moth breathing intensifies*
I literally just read this to find out if it was a guy who got knocked the fuck **out** or a girl who got knocked the fuck **up**.
"Reminds me of the dialogue from F.R.I.E.N.D.S : *""Monica darling, it's Amanda calling""*."
Found out last week people can see my eyes through my sunglasses. Spent the last week thinking about how many people noticed and them thinking how much of a creep I am
"Yeah for sure my BDP stems from alot of abandonment issues in my early life. So essentially the dream had created a pseudo abandonment scenario that when I woke up I thought was real and that I was in the middle of it. Put me into an unstable emotional state so, I wasn't able to just logically break the dream down at the time and figure out what was real."
So did you actually wait 30 days and did they threaten you during that 30 days?
That‘ pure gold! Had the best laugh in ages!!!
"Yes you can! Europe has chipped their competition horses for years and in the US we just implemented a rule last year (? Or the year before, I forget when) that competition horses (in Olympic events) have to be microchipped to compete in national competitions."
We were walking our Dane yesterday and passed a family with a toddler. The dad told her to wave hi to the horsey and it was the cutest thing.
Plot twist : *SHE IS A MEMBER OF MEN IN BLACK AND YOUR MEMORY WAS WIPED OUT BUT ONLY FEW FRAGMENTS OF IT REMAINED*
"Yea you did kinda forget the question lol, but someone else made me feel like a dunce. But yea I've helped a vet with teeth cleaning, from the outside it looks super barbaric due to a power drill being in a horse's mouth but it's fun to be apart of.

 Another interesting thing is (gross) that horses obviously can't clean the smegma off their dicks so as humans it's our duty to help them get it clean. When I helped a vet he grabbed the horses doing and just went to town getting it off, I was cringing so hard at it."
This is a wholesome story. Thank you for sharing!
He honestly hates being around other horses. The barn he was at tried to turn him out with many different horse Companions and none of it worked out. He's actually amazingly happy having this huge field to himself

"Well obviously cash it then tell them it's your policy to issue refunds only after 30 years. Or better, once 30 day time frame is expired and they request it let them know, ""Oh, all refund requests must be sent by mail to be processed and it's 30 days from when we process the request."""

Yup it is and funny the office did come into mind while reading this.

I sat near Al Franken at the Nationals game over the weekend but other than that first time I’ve seen a politician in the 3 years I’ve lived here. I think they travel by secret underground tunnels.
Keep her.
I’m glad this didn’t end the way I thought it would

"&gt;"" to protect us while Daddy is gone""

This is the grossest part to me, I'm not sure why. It's not like she fucked some random in a hotel bar. To invite someone into your home and acclimate your kids to them as a normal part of their lives while their dad's away...so sick."
"Your not the proplem don't blame yourself he obviously didn't like the marrige and wanted a way out

Please don't blame yourself"
"I'm a woman (so nobody hate me lol) and I know there's sadistic men and women alike out there. But I swear on average women cheat so much worse than men.

"I started asking questions about my parent's marriage at one point, and holy shit did I stop quickly."
"&gt;before you kissed her.

Why would you kiss your mom on her lips?"
Bro same fucking thing. I feel for you. My mom is still suck a super slut and cheats on my step dad all the time. Even though she has MS! My dad straight out kicked me out of the house we rented together because we had a disagreement and turns out it pissed him wayyy off so he told me he might not even be my dad and flipped shit on me for a hot minute. I’m sorry you’re dealing with this shit I really do feel for you.
Agreed.
No Reddit doesn’t count. It’s anonymous.
"he propose to that bitch, that''s the FU"
OP. It's all good. At least you've got a good fire brigade that will actually show up to help. You could have been seriously hurt and they woulda been there for you. I used to live somewhere where kids would pull the alarm all the time so the fire men would assume it was a false alarm. Until it wasnt and I had to call them to tell them they should really show up this time. Unit below me has a kitchen fire when kids were left home alone and the kids where trapped in there. They got them all out. And the only unit effected was that one.
Always better to know the truth...
That was a really cute TIFU story haha
"I too fucked up in this manner, about the same age as well. Mom also remarried multiple times even marrying the guy she fucked over my dad for twice. People are just fucking weird I do not think ultimately anyone can be trusted to do anything but serve their own self-interest"
"Just remember it's not your fault. This is entirely your mom's fault. She is a terrible person, and you can't be at fault for doing nothing wrong."
"Aw man, I'm a ""save the marriage"" baby too, in this case my dad was cheating. My mom knew but stayed just so we could have a father figure. Now that I'm older I disagree wholeheartedly, I'm glad your dad got you away from your... less-than-perfect mother."
Yeah but the fight usually isn't between the bride and groom!
"Honestly, I wouldn't blame yourself. 

I blamed myself before because I remember my parents started arguing after one argument involving me but I look back to it and it was bound to happen.

Your mother had committed an action that had consequences, until consequences happened she would have kept doing it until she was caught."
"He is your real dad. Even if not by blood, he is still the one who raised you and always loved you. You weren’t the mistake. Sounds like your mom might’ve been the problem if she has married three times."
I wouldn't necessarily say this is a fuck up
