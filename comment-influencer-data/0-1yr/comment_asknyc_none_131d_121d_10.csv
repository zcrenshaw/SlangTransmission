"-when traveling on Amtrak, wait on the level between the main timetables and the tracks at Penn Station. The tracks will be announced on the small TVs and you’ll be able to go right to your track without waiting in the line upstairs 

-order delivery on the phone when applicable. It’s often cheaper than Seamless. 

-ride the public buses down 5th ave during the holiday season. You can catch the Rockefeller tree and the decorated stores and be warm at the same time. 

-download library books to a kindle really easily with an amazon account and NYPL login. Our system gets a LOT of “copies”/licenses of digital books, so even if you put a hold on a popular book, it’s usually available in a few days. 

-If you buy monthly unlimited metrocards, get the expresspay one that refills itself 

-list things for free on Craigslist that you want to get rid of quickly without taking down the stairs. When I was moving, I would list things I didn’t want to take with me and say it has to be gone within 30 mins (for safety make sure you’re not home alone). Saved me so much time and energy bringing heavy items out of the apartment to the curb. 

-if you can manage it financially, overlap leases by a week or two if you can when moving. Makes such a difference."
Never. If living in New York has taught me anything it's to not take anything personally.
"Finance world, a lot.  Academic world, minimal.  All of my finance friends hate their job, life, and themselves while the academic wish they had money."
"I would try to narrow your search to be:
- North of 43rd Street
- West of 8th
- East of 11th
- South of 57th street
These parameters will keep you far enough from Times Square and Columbus Circle to avoid the busier, less residential areas.

On top of this, go for an address on a street rather than an avenue (i.e., 555 West 48th St, not 555 9th Ave). The avenues can be much busier and louder. Be forewarned, summers along 9th Ave in the 40s result in non-stop beeping on Friday afternoons when everyone is jammed up trying to get out of town via the tunnel."
"For  years I've seen a crazy guy midtown, around 50th/6th, always in rags,  pushing a cart and yelling, sometimes into a microphone about nothing coherent.
Today, I saw him sitting outside a coffee shop, speaking with another fellow dressed in suit, and the two carried on about current affairs like he was Walter Cronkite.
Blew my mind...."
"NYC is the only place I’ve ever lived where I met a ton of casual coke users. I have barely encountered anybody I’d call a real addict, but I know a fuckload of folks that will do a bit here and there or in the right situation. In other places, it’s just not a thing the way it is here."
"Cafe China (Michelin star) has an $11 lunch deal w an entree (comes with rice), hot/sour soup, and spring rolls!"
"What's this ""removed"" you're talking about? Does not compute."
I hope you enjoy sitting in the back while two cops sit on their phones while parked on the sidewalk
Staying inside helps avoid the crowds!!
"Because you might get stabbed. Seriously, my philosophy for surviving here is, ""you never know how much crazier than you the other person is."""
"It seems like every year some moron gets hit by lightning standing on a rooftop to watch a storm.  So, yes."
Holy shit I now know what I’m doing with these pot brownies.
"Never anymore. When I was a teenager I lost it a couple times at people (most memorable was when a middle-aged couple kicked my seat at the theater because I put my head on my mom's shoulder), but now I do not ever engage. If I'm mad, I imagine a response in my head and try to get the satisfaction without actually getting into a fight. If it's not working I walk away. It's not worth it."
"I own a row frame house in Brooklyn, the old adage applies, In an urban area the quality of your life, depends on the quality of your neighbors."
"I also get disoriented when places put up those plastic and vinyl vestibules in front of their entrances for the colder months and then take em down as it gets warmer. 

Every time they transition them off or on I feel like I'm lost."
To increase your quality of life. Make more money
2) use commas
"Couple weeks ago I saw a dog trying to carry an enormous distinctive-looking branch down the sidewalk, with his owner pulling it away because it was blocking everyone’s way. An hour later, and several blocks away, I saw a dapper young man strolling down the street using the same branch as a walking stick."
"Okay, so NYC paramedic here. I 100% suggest you file a report. There are cameras everywhere that the police may be able to access to get the plate. Plus your ankle could definitely turn into something like a tear and having a police report can help your case with medical bills as new is a ""no fault"" state."
"Take the cash first, then let them test ride."
"Will it be anything like Superbad? If not, you can count me out."
You only looked at two apartments. It's a numbers game like dating and job hunting.
Ask your buddy.
There was a very intoxicated man caressing a pineapple on the N train tonight.
It doesn’t add days. You have an unlimited 30 day stored on the card that will activate the first time you swipe after the current one expires.
"Only responsively — and maybe once every couple of years.  Sometimes someone decides to be confrontational and you might want to yell back.  But I do prefer to avoid it.  

(The last was a woman who was upset that I was pushing a normal-sized stroller on a narrow sidewalk and so had to take turns getting through — which annoyed her tiny dog.  She yelled something about not taking up the whole sidewalk (it’s one person wide...) because her dog has to get by, and I told her to shove her tiny dog up her ass.  Good times.  But, come on, say something bitchy about my baby daughter?  You deserve a chihuahua up the drainpipe.)

I don’t include in this yelling on my bike to warn people when they’re jaywalking — “coming through,” “heads up,” etc.  That’s just good manners."
Package Free Shop in Williamsburg has one brand of biodegradable glitter in stock at least - Bioglitz (full disclosure some of my friends work for them). I wouldn't be surprised if they have other brands too since there are a few good ones out there.
"Anyone saying it isn't that bad on weekends are lying to you, it's always that bad in the Heights."
"Make sure your lawyer takes a good look at the financial disclosures for any buildings you're interested in. Don't want to buy into a corrupt co-op.

Buying is generally sweet though. My co-op's cost stayed pretty stable while prices in Astoria exploded. Own a house now in Astoria. It's good but oh god everything is expensive to fix/replace and paying for heat is expensive as hell."
"I did it when I was in college. It was a fun time. Rode in the back of the police car while they patrolled the east village and told me stories about the old days of alphabet city, when Ave A was adventurous, B was bold, C was crazy and D was dead. They dropped me off at my dorm and everybody was asking if I got arrested."
"- *Always* look both ways when crossing bike lanes
- On a related note, when crossing the street glance between the cars to see if there are any bikes coming
- Carry a reusable water bottle around with you"
"Do you have rainboots and umbrellas? If not, first go to your closest cheap shoe store and buy cheap rubber rain boots and get an umbrella at Duane Reade. Now go do whatever else you were going to do."
"You could hone in on a social hobby. For me, it’s skateboarding. I can go to a skatepark and always find a few people to be friendly with and get to know eachother. Tbh, I don’t normally take it past skating together but I’m fine with knowing the regulars on a first name basis and being able to ask them for change for a drink. Also, and helpful in your case, the potential to hang out eventually

Another piece of advice is a job that requires social skills or the development of them. I worked at Starbucks for 5 years. When I came in, I was 17 and very shy. By the time I left, I knew all the regulars, made friends with some customers, got some girl customers numbers, even got inspiration to go to business school. Most importantly, I made life long friendships with so many coworkers over the years. That job was truly the best thing to happen for my growth from a quiet teenager to an extroverted adult. 


Some other suggestions:
-try pushing up bed time to around 11:30 
-go to a quieter bar 
-get a coke or a drink without alcohol in it


Good luck brother!"
"I have a pretty hard ""Finance bro"" look to me. I got offered cocaine 5 times in one night when I was up in midtown. 

And the stereotypes are true. Almost every finance buddy I know has a story about how one of his friends did some stupid shit on cocaine."
"Unless she quickly stabs you before you can react. it doesn't take much and shit can happen quick. ""big"" people die plenty often it being tall and fit doesnt magically stop a blade or bullet from ripping into you."
"late June to early August, late day pop-up thunderstorms are common. needs to be hot and humid. could be raining in midtown, sunny and dry downtown."
 I get my chicken and waffles fix from Buttermilk Channel in Carol Gardens when I'm feeling homesick. The waffles are PERFECT and they work with both sweet and savory sides.
"Everyone I know does, has done, or knows somebody who does cocaine frequently. It's super, super common here. My friend does it with her coworkers at her marketing agency."
"I'd avoid spa castle and go to Sojo in Edgewater, NJ. Much cleaner, and soooooo many pools and saunas to visit. There's a shuttle that leaves every hour from 42nd &amp; 8th."

"A house? No. A home? Yes. 

Most middle class people don’t own their own freestanding building. They own a unit in a co-op or condo building."
Machismo.
"That’s a funny point, while none of my friends are coke addicts a lot of them do it casually. It’s funny too because it’s not specific to any particular group, sure my finance friends do it but so does the waitress, receptionist, software engineer, community center coordinator, etc."
"Because FDNY are the ones that actually deserve respect, NYPD are scum, and they know it... voila there's an artificial rivalry."
"Understand that you may truly love dogs, but they aren’t party props. 

It might sound like a fun idea for you and your friends, but not for the dog who would be trotted out into a loud, overwhelming party. 

Be conscious of yourself and please realize that even though it is not your intent, you are endangering the animals and set a precedent for others to do the same."
Hotel lobbies are great for bathrooms too.
"I drove out to the beach in the middle of the night last week to scream into the ocean. It was cathartic enough until I realized I gave up my parking spot to do it.

Otherwise alcoholism has been very effective in helping me blow off steam. How important is *liver health* to you?"
Service industry is full of casual drug addicts.
Have you talked to his parents? He seems to listen to them lmao
It might sound stupid but the kitchen world has a lot of coke users too.
Drugs are fun?
"I was sitting in Metrotech Commons in Brooklyn, just people watching. Along comes a mother with two young children (both under 10), and both kids are riding scooters.

I turn my head elsewhere for a moment, and then when I turn back, seemingly out of nowhere a male little person (dwarfism) with a backpack, who is unrelated to the mom and kids, walks past them and somehow becomes a referee for a series of scooter drag races between the two siblings. I hear him shout, ""On you mark, get set, go!"", and the kids come racing toward him. He declares a winner, the kids go back about 50 or a hundred yards, and repeat the whole process again. 

This guy calls about three or four races for them, then goes on his way, sits down on a bench, pulls out his phone, and starts reading. A mother and her two children go on their way, and the moment is over."
Jean George is pretty reasonable. One of my favorites.

"When catching a car from JFK, take the airtrain to lefferts blvd.  there are Ubers sitting there waiting for people and the place is mostly empty so you can avoid the chaos of getting picked up in the airport arrivals area. The airtrain is free if you get off at lefferts."
"

My roommate has used meetup and does a every other week board game night but they don’t hang out with anyone from there outside of the game nights. 

I’m with you, I’m not a fan of being out super late either. You could start with co workers if there’s any you click well with. Or find any local events happening in the area that interest you. Like example being the Strand has events every now and then or when Back when the Drama Bookshop was opened, they’d have free readings. What I’m trying to say is start with something that interests you and do some research. NYC is full of tons of things. I wish you luck!"
"Axe Throwing is not a cathartic event at all. It's really carefully controlled (for necessary safety reasons) and is basically like a highly-supervised of darts that you might play at any old bar, but with axes instead of darts. 

Personally I recommend just going on long walks in the park."
King Spa is a Korean bath house in New Jersey that often has deals—they pick you up in a shuttle van in Ktown
"When you come across a don't walk signal, don't stare at that signal instead look at the crosswalk signal for the other crosswalk/s and look for their countdown along with the traffic lights and traffic (turn signals help) around you for the earliest sense of when it'll be safe to cross the street. 

I realize most people are too chill/slow walkers for this to be useful and the aggressive/fast walkers like me likely already figured most of this out."
