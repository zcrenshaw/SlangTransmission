0,"\&gt;  a lot of guys don't like blowing me because I'm pretty leaky

Their loss, our gain.  Precum in my mouth gives me the motivation to keep going.

Edit: and now I'm hard as a fucking rock."
1,I think they're cool. wear whatever you want.
2,"I don't have any friends, can't relate."
3,Think of it as an appetizer before the main course.
4,I love that this thread about being careful on Grindr turned into porn sharing.
5,No.are you serious about hot romanian and bulgarian dom tops? They exist??
6,They wouldn‚Äôt matter to me.
7,"It‚Äôs a selection bias. People who are good looking are more likely to show themselves off online. Whereas on Grindr, it‚Äôs basically anyone."
8,"It's not good to withhold your virginity for several years holding out for ""the one"".

I don't think you should also lose your v-card just for the sake of losing it, either.  But sex is awesome (usually) so if the other guy is cute and y'all are jiving well, I say go for it.  

I lost mine during a houseparty with someone I'd met there; was a blast."
9,"No, the idea itself is not an insult to gay people. Of course a lot of straight people are homophobes, but that doesn't mean closeted gay people can't be or are not. I've personally met several homophobic people that I've later seen with someone of the same gender or swiped left on on Tinder. Usually they're Christians who can't come to grips with the fact that their religion is regressive medieval ideology that would justify them being burnt in Hell for their attractions. Don't pretend they don't exist. A lot of gay people cannot admit it to themselves and it's important not to make them feel even more invisible."
10,"Bot, NSFW this immediately!"
11,Poor selection in one of the US's major cities??
12,Good for you.
13,Silvia is such a ho.
14,"First off, props to you for being able to say your true feelings and not just stay with it because you didn't want to hurt your partner.  Takes a lot of courage.  

With that said...if you are really over the relationship, the best is to, in my opinion, not answer or respond.   I ended a 10yr (4yrs married) and tried the ""let's keep talking"" route.  Short term it seemed to help, but actually it was just making the long term hurt that much more.  You have your partner a second shot, and it didn't work out.  You tried and you know now that it won't fulfill what you need.  

In the end, you have to love yourself and be happy, because if you're not, how can you share that with someone else?   Good luck bro"
15,Isn‚Äôt 8mile in Detroit
16,Good job fetishizing black men. I hate people like u
17,"Not sure, maybe too much porn has desensitized you?"
18,My first boyfriend killed himself after being bullied for being gay and my brother feels really bad for being one of those people so for this guys sake and yours I suggest telling your friends to stop being assholes and contributing to someone's trauma.
19,My career
20,"You don't need anyone's permission to break up with them.  Tell him once more it's over, and then block him."
21,I learned that the world didn't come to an end when I turned 30...
22,"Dominance. That‚Äôs what a lot of rape is about anyway. It‚Äôs not to actually enjoy the act but to show dominance and power over the victim, making them feel worthless"
23,"Congrats for reaching 30 first of all.  It's a great decade coming up so don't stress about it. 

I have learned how to rely on myself more, love myself more because, even with close ones around, we are alone facing our life and our problems. I try to cherish my good friends and make new ones along the way. I pay attention to character and intelligence much more than I did before.

Life is a journey and we should keep growing as we move forward."
24,"The one that involves lots of french kissing, cuddling, making out, licking and kissing each other's full body, tickling, mutual masturbation, fellatio, fingering, laughing and lots of intimacy."
25,"You're thinking Calgary, 300km South. It's slightly bigger but not by much. Some people there love to make fun of this place, as if they're any better, the two are mirror images of each other üòÇ"
26,"My boyfriend used to precum heaps, so much so it wud create long glistening strings... we were at a nude beach. I used to love watching it swing around in the gentle breeze. Pure male sensuality. It tasted so sweet tooüòã"
27,I learned that I don't owe anyone anything. I stopped trying to please people to fit in.
28,"My experiences have generally been the opposite.

Granted, I don't do apps or bars, and living in a fairly conservative area probably explain the difference."
29,It is really very very low risk. Don‚Äôt worry.
30,Social validation post at its finest. The only opinion that should matter is yours when it comes to your life. The rest is arbitrary.
31,"I think some guys make a new profile because it resets everything so no one has blocked them and they have an empty inbox. Also some dudes are just dumb and can't remember their password so they make a whole new account. 

I knew a guy that had two profiles on Jack'd, one for his iPad and one for his phone. He would message me back and forth jumping between them and it was annoying."
32,Bullying is wrong. Don't be a pussy.
33,"Yup.  Completely serious.  These dudes are cocky and love to be worshipped and serviced and to take charge.  For what I'm talking about check out Gencho &amp; Friends vids by Harlem Hookups.  It's real.  There are tons of guys like this.  Here I'll go ahead and give you the links.

34,Sorry that‚Äôs happened to you.  Keep your head up. Not everyone is like that. But awesome job with the weight loss. You look great.
35,"i guess the wet spots can be annoying to handle, but i find precum rather hot, if i may say so. i am the opposite and i am not a huge fan. guess we always want what we can't have."
36,Yes
37,Don‚Äôt do anything you‚Äôre not comfortable doing. Rules of consent don‚Äôt change at a bathhouse.
38,"Celebrating 30 years with my husband, starting our own business , quitting our day jobs and completely relying on ourselves to make a life together."
39,‚ÄúNever speak to me or my asshole again‚Äù
40,username checks out
41,I‚Äôve seen guys wear these and a lot of them are so revealing they might as well not be wearing a shirt. Which is just how I like it.
42,"Edmonton, Canada. See. You don't even know where it is xD"
43,how about Budapest? I though they call us hunGAYrians for a reason
44,"I‚Äôm all natural, knew a guy that was super into that and even though I haven‚Äôt seen him in awhile it just sort of stuck with me and haven‚Äôt shaved or trimmed after that"
45,"It's wrong because it has the ability to disrupt the family dynamic. When you have a family. An innate sense of unity is created. Everyone is together like a chain link, unromantically. 

When incest happens. That link breaks and gets all fucked up. The intensity of the fuck up can vary if it's a parent child or child child incest. Depending on the circumstances.  Chances are. The couple may know it's wrong already. I dont think anyone has incest thinking it's right  and is surprised by the backlash unless they're depraved."
46,Yes Keep trying.  Maybe 69 would be fun too.
47,"Managed to wriggle out of going to Atlanta this year, for work. I was told there was nothing much there. 

I went to Marseille again, instead, which is a personal fave.

A city I keep going back to because its phenomenally interesting, is Istanbul."
48,I'm sure being a medical professional the sight of a gay person won't rock his world
49,could be a bit of bruising. definitely not an STD
50,Your cock is beautiful and don't let anyone tell you otherwise
51,"I didn't see it. Is it on Netflix? I'll look for it. I know on the surface what's going on sounds ridiculous, but it's not."
52,He's a bottom in a city of bottoms. Happens...
53,"Jesus, way to be overdramatic"
54,"yeah, a lot of bi guys are very straight-acting"
55,I mean it‚Äôs TV so they‚Äôll do whatever is entertaining
56,How do you verify someone's gay?

58,"It‚Äôs actually backed by research. They may be repressed and unaccepting of a gay identity but are attracted to males. Further, sexual assault is often as much about control as it is sexual attraction. Sexual assault is in most cases a way to victimize and express one‚Äôs dominance on another person."
59,"I've had dates walk out or ghost me because they see my cane (I don't use it all the time) or I open up a bit about my physical limitations. It's just part of the general immaturity of people. I suggest raising your standards a bit and have some personal rules for when those things happen. Each time it does it's only one person, not everyone. And that person probably won't be a part of your life anyway. I know it can be very discouraging. I've had better luck with Tinder because it's less revolved around hookups."
60,Tasting precum while sucking a dick is the best. Your leaky dick is natural and should be appreciated.
61,"I also live in one of the largest metro cities in the US and feel the same way at times. Maybe it‚Äôs just the group of gay men I hang out with, but there is a level of shallowness that doesn‚Äôt resonate with me and I‚Äôve been pulling away from the group. Kinda surprising since you‚Äôd think that the behavior would reduce as we get older."
62,"No, I have not experienced that.  My gay friends are so much more fun than my straight friends."
63,Yikes. I hope I never get this lax about sex where I nonchalantly do a threesome after almost being a victim of a hate crime.

65,"&gt; I‚Äôm not even great looking,

i mean we can make out right now so i can prove how wrong you are about yourself"
66,Seeing this post made me really happy because I've recently met this guy on tinder who is 20 years older than me. We really feel like we have a connection but thoughts of my friends not approving were kind of stopping me from going further with this person. Now I am a little more sure!
67,chickenhawk was one term I heard when I was younger.
68,"&gt; California is literally paradise

As a Pacific Northwesterner, no.

Burn California into the ground."
69,"Is there no way to get the blood test on Friday, and are the results immediate?  Because that would solve your moral problem: you could wait for the confirmatory blood test.

Letting him sit all weekend though without getting his own appointments set up while a possible infection is spreading through his body, and you know about it, would be a horrible betrayal. 

Call around to whoever you have to to get an appointment tomorrow for a blood test.  Call blood testing labs in your area, do whatever you must.  If you can't, the only right thing to do is to tell him now.

I'm sorry Luigi.  E-Hugs and love to you."
70,The risk of HIV transmission via oral sex is so low it's virtually 0. You need to educate yourself on HIV transmission and consider seeing someone about your anxiety.
71,"Oh man I‚Äôm sorry to hear how you were treated. That guy was an asshole. We all have things that make us less than perfect. The thing is to find someone that loves you enough those things don‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôm currently seeing a guy that‚Äôs got a problem with social cues. But I just make sure to explain to him more clearly when he is missing something.

Be strong it gets better!"
72,Really? Why? lol
73,"Hahah, ok"
74,"I‚Äôve traveled solo extensively and have lived abroad for most of my adult life, usually in new countries where I barely know anyone. Traveling alone, at first, can seem scary, but it‚Äôs one of the most liberating and best things you can do for yourself. Because at the end of the day, you will only do things that you want to do. Every decision you make is for yourself and you don‚Äôt have to worry about accommodating someone else‚Äôs interest. 

In terms of your concerns, download maps.me and you can download offline the maps of the places you‚Äôre traveling to. I believe google maps has the same functionality. You‚Äôll be able to get around without data or WiFi. Also, in Spain and France, most people understand English so you‚Äôll be fine. 

Getting pickpocketed is possible in the bigger cities in Europe, but getting mugged is not as common from what I‚Äôve heard. Be aware of your surroundings and you‚Äôll be fine. I‚Äôve lived in Europe for over 2 years and have traveled extensively throughout the continent and I only personally know of 3 instances of friends who have got pickpocketed. In terms of assault, I don‚Äôt personally know of any (though it does happen). 

Overall, you‚Äôll be more than fine. Enjoy your trip!"
75,"Get drunk, smoke weed, use poppers."
76,"I lost my virginity to a Grindr hookup and I don‚Äôt regret it. Saving yourself for someone you love is kind of an outdated concept, but all the power to the people who do adhere to it. Just go out and enjoy yourself and your sexuality. You‚Äôll never know what you like or don‚Äôt like until you try. Just be safe!"
77,"This is such a problem with gay culture. You need to be happy with yourself first. When you love yourself, guys see that confidence and THAT attracts them."
78,"Definitely overthinking it. It's common, don't feel ashamed. It takes a while to relax especially with new lovers. Just remind yourself you're having fun. The emotional connection seems more important to you than the sex and that's totally fine. Hot, if you ask me."
79,"You're already starting from several bad assumptions and I doubt you're going to be discussing this in good faith.  That said...

Being open means that the relationship with your partner is MORE THAN just sex.  imo even in an open relationship the majority of sexytime still ought to be between just the two in the couple.  Sex is often a vehicle to express love, but sometimes it's just its own activity.  And having sexytimes with someone that isn't your partner is often enjoyable/novel and potentially gives me something to try on the partner next time.  

I mean, is one free to have friends other than their partner, even in a non sexual capacity?  Someone who I might share hobbies/interests with that my partner does not participate in?  Whose company is welcome and are nice, supportive, and genuine?  Why is sex the one activity that's restricted to be only between the two in the couple while time shared outside of the partner going hunting or someshit is deemed as normal and okay?  

Is going hunting (e.g.) without my partner showing that I'm not fully committed to my partner?  Is not joining my partner when he goes hunting showing a lack of commitment as well?"
80,That‚Äôs a very kind comment. Thank you very much for taking the time! You sound like a very kind guy yourself :)
81,Are you ***serious***? Right in from of ***my salad??***
82,Absolutely - focus on you for a while and enjoy singledom!
83,Yeah I get it! You‚Äôre welcome
84,"Maybe you're right after all, though. Appreciate the advice if it really is objective."
85,That's considered the gold standard.  It looks like a really easy program to me and I've heard nothing but great things about it for beginners.
86,I'm just going to leave [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/lstdy/a_note_regarding_the_socalled_researchers_that/) here. I'd recommend anyone who's even considering participating in this to read it.

89,"I, personally, don't. If you're packing more than 9 inches, me and my asshole are taking our business elsewhere."
90,"Check out the book, ""Healing from Hidden Abuse"" by Shannon Thomas."
91,"No, not really. The only 'Dad bod' I'd put up with is one that looks ripped and chiseled like Hugh Jackman or Brad Pitt. As for those beer bellies, I'd gladly pass, in fact thinking about it just send a shiver down my spine."
92,"I love this community. It's people like you that have genuinley saved my life, Thanks to both of you for supporting each other in a very difficult time, Sending my love guys !!  ‚ù§‚ù§"
93,"The feeling is mutual, at least for me. Be sure to show interest though, because I don't ever want to feel like an old creep hitting on a young guy without some sort of invitation, even if it's non-verbal. Eye contact and a smile is good enough, I'll approach you if I see that."
94,"treat dating as a fun thing you do, and not the negative experience you seem to be doing. I said this earlier to someone but it appears on this sub, well, and elsewhere, lots of people are turning dating into this really negative experience when it isn't. it gets better after that.

and, you can work on yourself too. you can actually do both at the same time"

98,"You said he agreed to meeting again..... so why be afraid of rejection?

Msg him. Go with the flow. You aren't asking him to give you a kidney or get married.."
99,I wear underwear. I'm shocked by how many people don't.
100,That‚Äôs hot.
101,"Having a good pic is essential. Having no pic is better than having a bad pic (in terms of getting messages).  To be honest, I don‚Äôt really read to much into the bio , especially if it‚Äôs long. Keep it short and to the point."
102,"There's no such thing as ""mutual cheating.""  The definition of cheating varies for each relationship, and it isn't simply limited to having sex with someone other than your SO.  It's on the couple to decide what is considered cheating or not.  Again, ""mutual cheating"" is not a thing.  If it's mutual, it's not cheating, and if it's cheating, it's not mutual."
103,I see good looking guys of all positions on grindr. maybe it's just where you live or how you've applied your filters.
104,Thanks for the info :)
105,No...I dont mind interracial porn. I hate people who cal black people BBC
106,I can see that. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs in reference to Foghorn Leghorn and his chicken hawk buddy.
107,Did you end up reaching out to him again?
108,Guys with self esteem issues...
109,"I tried hooking up several times and I never enjoyed it, so I guess that I'd prefer to do it with someone whom I have an emotional connection. Even in my sexual fantasies intimacy is something that is present."
110,omg this is a real sub?! yessssss
111,It's especially tragic when one party tricks the other into marriage while being fully aware they don't want to remain monogamous. They know the other person will not agree yet ... Dirty little spiders (I know lots of people only realize one isn't enough when 'its too late')
112,Hooking up can be fun and exciting.  So go get all the dick.
113,Try it out man. I hate it now but I get lonely so I just go for it. Would def recommend trying to invest in a boyfriend but I know that‚Äôs hard. And since you‚Äôre young so meet guys in public first so you don‚Äôt get your throat slit.
114,"I made a baby!!!! ***PROUD, PROUD BABY!!!!!!*** I did it by fucking the cum into the butthole!!!"
115,"He's my boss, and many of the staff, patients, and their family complain that he's unprofessional and borderline negligent, which is important when you work in healthcare. 

Oh and he allegedly screwed one of my coworkers in one of the rooms at work *and I'm totally not envious, guys.*"
116,Stopped at a rest stop in Kansas at about 1 in the morning. I walk in and there's a guy butt naked on his knees by the urinals jacking his dick. I watched for a while then had him suck my cock as three different guys came in. Two stayed to watch and one just opened the door and noped the fuck out of there lmao

119,"I was there last year. It was the 3rd bathhouse I‚Äôd been to and definitely better than the other 2 I‚Äôd been to. I like just sitting in the hot tub and watching guys go by. 

I tend to wait for guys to approach me. If you approach someone, don‚Äôt be pushy. You can make eye contact or say, ‚Äúhey, what‚Äôs up.‚Äù If they respond, you can continue the interaction."
120,Patience poppers and perseverance
121,"&gt;You start sentences with ""but"" which is a common mistake even with native speakers.

I wouldn't even call that a mistake. From what I can tell, the major style guides don't have any issue with it, and it certainly doesn't make the writing any harder to understand. Not to mention it's extremely common and shows up pretty much everywhere."
122,Yeah
123,"For real tho. I'm looking to have a good time, not to feel like I crammed an eggplant up there."
124,"bruh cooking is so fun, especially making sweets like homemade waffles are the best"

127,"Wtf, Mohamed. Just stuff her into a burka."

130,If the account is verified by someone‚Äôs credit card or id it will be easier to locate someone so these things could put people off from committing a crime.
131,I was expecting some ghosting story... Be careful when meeting people online people.
132,It's relatively cheap for it's size and significance. I'm in the process of moving. The city where I'm coming from has a higher cost of living. And it's only a city of little over a million full of endless suburbia with very limited entertainment and LGBT options
133,"I just completely shaved for the first time in a decade and now I remember why I hated it.  I have a smaller dick so it just made me look like some wierd man baby. 

 Trimming is a lot easier and less time consuming. Plus not razor burn or ingrown hairs."
134,Damn üòÇüò≠ I just don‚Äôt wanna get embarrassed or hated ya know
135,"Amsterdam. I went to an underwear party at a club called church.  Hot fit guys everywhere. Hundreds of them!  Dicks were out everywhere... upstairs, downstairs, on the dance floor.

I also had fun in Barcelona at this bar with a dark room in back. I accidentally came all over this guys jeans because this other guy in our circle jerk came in my hand."
136,"No harm, no foul."
137,"A lot along the line of everyone else. Realizing I can either be my own advocate or work against my own interests. That it‚Äôs okay and sometime healthy to be alone and choose where to spend my time and energy.

140,I'm sure you still look amazing ;)
141,"I was 13. I was going out with a girl from the next town over, but I'd known for a while I was only doing it to hide my sexuality and that wasn't fair on her. I texted her and we met up down the park. Sat down on a bench with her, told her we had to break up, she started crying, I started crying. She asked why, and through tears I told her I was gay. She took a few minutes to process what was said, but stopped crying and eventually said, ""That's as good a reason as any I suppose.""

We laughed and cuddled and remained friends. Bit heavy for 13 years old, I know."
142,Butte-edge-edge
143,Only a crazy person would refuse an offer like this

152,Cool :)
153,"Hmm interesting. What do you like about socks? Do you like the smell, the way they make the calves look? I've always been intrigued by foot fetishes lol"
154,It cost about 30-45. Depends on the day. But i suck gis dick for an hour and a half and eats my ass in between. It takes him.a while for him to cum though
155,Lol I dont even drive more than a mile out of my way to get fucked. No way in hell I'd drive that far to give head.
156,"I loveeeee totally bald guys, especially when they have a beard. Im starting to think i may have a fetish for guys with bald shiny heads lol."
157,because they're ignorant as fuck.
158,He covers one way for me. But i paid round trip once.
159,"Ok, cool"
160,Yeah 5mins its not worth it man lol.
161,"That's a good point. I live in a very large liberal city here in the US. One of the largest, and fitting in and being accepted by the straight world is not an issue here."
162,"Montreal as somewhere I can go for relatively cheap and still be in another culture.

absolutely loved Paris, Rome, and LA, but after a few weeks in each, I had no desire to ever go back... Montreal is somewhere I could easily go to and just hang out for a week every year."

164,Epic!!
165,üòÇ
166,"After your response I would say the same thing. He asked you if you‚Äôre gay therefore he left you some space to claim you‚Äôre bi, just for sake of exploring his motives for original question.

171,Was ist because of her homophobia or was she rattled because her crush doesn't like her sex?

I can't right now but in a few months I'll go as hairless as possible."

175,"Fair enough, +1.  I got my registration updated on the 1st so I can at least vote by mail.  I'm still going on the election day holiday though."
176,Yeah I definitely prefer girls to guys but there‚Äôs just something about giving guys head that turns me on. I just hope to have an experience that‚Äôs good and maybe find a regular
177,No. There was a guy in college who made two accounts so when someone blocked him he could message them to see why and then didn‚Äôt understand why he got blocked again
178,Well yeah but you should still be safe
179,"I agree.  If I would have went no contact with my parents back in 2010, it would have been incredibly painful at the time but I maybe could actually have had a life this decade.  Coming to terms with what is basically a lost decade, spent in misery and depression trying to please my religious parents, is much more difficult than that would have been."
180,"Thanks for the words of encouragement and support, it means a lot to me."
181,"doesn't matter to me.

lack of self confidence is an instant turnoff to many though."
182,Yes because i care of what someone behind a computer says ü§£ü§£ü§£
183,"The primary focus I see with nofap is that people believe that masturbation and watching porn has hindered their life in some way. Instead of focusing on their goals they are too busy masturbating and watching porn. Also they believe that porn and fapping cause ED. Its meant to build confidence. If you dont fap you have this new energy and confidence (superpowers lol) Ive never made it longer than about 2 months but I've definitely wanted to see how 90 days of nofap would affect me.

 There are thousands if not millions of members of nofap around the world. If you want the support from the community don't let 3 or 4 ppl who have their own theories make you think everyone feels the same way. You don't need the community to focus on nofap. Simply just don't fap and no porn. Sex is still okay. I say simply but not fapping gets difficult after a week. Goodluck if you decide to do it!"
184,I'd take his word on it if your really only going by one incident years ago. Stimulants are pretty notorious for causing poeple who are 100% straight sober find gay things hot. Check r/stims  or r/drugs for many stories of this happening.
185,"been there, done that, no problems."
186,"Tons of respect for you and your friends. 

I just couldn‚Äôt stand a friend grabbing me or kissing me just because we are gay. It‚Äôs still offensive for me when people introduce you to other gay men because, YOU OBVIOUSLY GONNA MATE LIKE TWO DOGS IN HEAT. Because we‚Äôre gay and that‚Äôs what gays do. 

No, I want my friends with boundaries and the power to make out and kiss the people I desire."
187,"When travelling I bring my older phone with me as a backup - because I would be royally fucked if I lost my phone. My main phone has my main account with a display photo and a nice bio. 

My backup is the ""nasty"" one. Usually has my hotel name as the display name. Bio is some variant of ""Tourist from [flag emoji]. Swallowing loads in my hotel room starting at 8pm tonight."" I don't browse with this phone, I usually just get my profile on the grid every few hours then pick through the messages later on. Best of both worlds tbh."
188,"Yes! When you have sex, are you strictly a top? Do you kiss/make out? Any foreplay? Nipple play? Into any role playing? You gotta just live in the moment"
189,I have my reasons trust me he‚Äôs an ass

196,You took the whole thing?
197,I live three and a half hours away from my boyfriend so i know you are going to have some bad days and good days. We make phone dates to talk and watch a movie or tv show together. We send flowers on random days. He both visit each other every other week or at least once a month if stuff comes up.  We have been together for a year and one month. Communication is key. Never let your thoughts or emotions fester because distance can amp that stuff up like crazy.
198,Thanks x
199,"In the south Queer is and was the go-to insult for homosexual men. Faggot being a close second.

So for me it's the only word that makes me feel some type of way. I hate that word with a passion and I absolutely refuse to identify as such and I refuse to use it in reference to others."
200,That's two generalizations in a single question. Most straight guys aren't like that and neither are most gay guys on the opposite end. These things become rather simple to understand when you don't shuffle every person who fits into a specific label into a circle of behavior. People are individuals.
201,LOL
202,Can cook most things. Learnt as a child.
203,"There is no such thing as a gay player.  At least, I have never met one.

Sex is so easy to get in the gay community I have no idea why someone would go out with another guy on dates just to trick them into some fun, only to dump them later on.  It just seems psychotic at that point when you can easily get your dick sucked by logging onto Grindr or going to a bathhouse..."
204,"I remember I stood up on few occasion for smaller guys who were bullied in high school. I had the chance to be the one the biggest guy in my class and kind of had influence on my group of friends.

Guess what... I met one of those guy who I stood up for 15 years later on the street. He immediately came to me and told me he still remembers what I did for him on that day. 

It felt fucking good. Do it, you futur self will 100% approve."
205,"Honestly, coming out"
206,"I found out years after the fact that through both High School and University that my brother, and most of my close male friends all were on the brunt end of homophobic harassment to varying degrees for their proximity to me.  

When I asked why they never told me about it, they said I had enough to deal with without feeling bad they were being dragged into it as well.  It almost makes me tear up just writing that.  What a good group of fellas."
207,I Wouldnt mind getting my toes sucked üòå
208,"I'm nearly 60. During my teens I was regularly bullied. Not 'heavily', just lots of verbal abuse and snide comments. It wasn't for being gay - I didn't come out until decades later - I was just different. I was bullied because I liked different music, had different interests etc. The damage that did though was severe - it impacted my life for years and years. Bullying even if it seems 'low level' is not acceptable and you have no idea of the damage it can cause."
209,"There‚Äôs no skill involved in getting a gay man to have sex with you. 

Women have standards."
210,I'll still be going there. Not ideal but there's no better alternative for me.
211,Hahaha!!!!! Kinky fucker lol
212,Hell yeah
213,"Anybody who requires you to go to another site to do ANYTHING on Grindr/whatever is scamming you.

Not talking about ""add me on insta"" but ""pay money for this service"" or ""I only talk to guys on this site"" with a link."
214,"I'm surprised I am going to say this, but...

Weed helps. They best buttsex I have had, is when I'm a little (or a lot) stoned.

The other advice offered here also applies.  But I think weed is more useful than booze, when it comes to buttsex."

217,Not my thing
218,"Standing up for your beliefs (and someone else's) will often feel weird and awkward, it's honestly supposed to. Get over it, though, and help the kid out. ;)"
219,That wasn‚Äôt my implication. It‚Äôs just an outlandish experience which I think is great.
220,This guy makes a new account every few weeks and posts the same nonsensical shite trying to be funny
221,It's not safe to assume anything about a person you've never met or spoken to.
222,Yes. It doesn't change how hot I think they are and would still fuck them given the chance
223,I‚Äôve only completely shaved once and I hated the way it looked and plus the grow back was terrible. So I only keep them trimmed.
224,"Love can die, or be killed. Sounds like he killed off the love you had for him by taking you for granted. 

This is a terrible, and often unnecessary, way for a loving telationship to end but it happens all the time, unfortunately.

You need to move on. A break up isn't contingent upon both parties agreeing to it. Sometimes one party doesn't even know.

Regardless, move on with your life. Maybe tell him he can still occupy a place in your life as a friend (if you so choose) and he can control himself. Otherwise he will lose you completely. 

I've been fortunate to have maintained friendly relationships with all my exes. It's ideal and it takes work on both sides. However, it's not always possible for everyone.

If you can remain friendly, awesome! If not, you have to block him and completely remove him from your life entirely. 

Good luck."
225,"&gt;You dense motherfucker

Not very kind of you to say. And I have to tell you that I don't fuck mothers or even women in general since I'm gay."
226,Interesting. I‚Äôm a year and a half away and I expect to become a withered old husk on the very day.
227,Indeed that sub creeps the fuck out of me.
228,"Mine was during a presentation I was giving at work, and we all had to pretend it wasn't happening but there was of course no hiding it."
229,"That sounds like it could either be the best thing ever (cue Mormon tabernacle choir going doooo-wahhh!) or given the age of the participants, it could be just very, very awkward indeed and come across as tacky. High risk."
230,"My entire teenage life. Semi was my effective default state from early adolescence up to the age of 19, and it doesn't take much to provoke more than that.

Honestly, I developed this attitude of stubbornly *refusing* to be embarrassed about my male anatomy, when I was in my early teens. Aside from a couple instances of someone having cleverly made it an awkward thing for the humor of it, all in good fun, I just plain wouldn't allow myself to be overly self-conscious."
231,"These people are allowed to have their own opinions, so all you can really do is ignore them. I face an inverse problem, with many people I know being religious while I am not. In fact, I have many problems with established religion, but I will never shame someone for their piety (assuming they don't try to convert me). It's up to the individual whether or not they decide to be religious, and some people want everyone to be the same as themselves. My advice is that you state why you are religious (i.e. it provides a sense of purpose, etc.), and end the conversation."

252,"Sorry i didnt mean to come at you like that, i apologize"
253,"Oh to be 22 again. I would have done everything SO SO differently.

I am going to tell you what I would have told my 22 yr old self had Reddit existed:

Play hard, work harder. Boys will come and go. Invest in yourself. Concentrate on the career goals. Keep the dates casual."
254,"Just constantly improve yourself for now. Find new ways to challenge and grow yourself and do new things. The more you put out the more you get back and maybe, just maybe on one of those self betterment adventures, you‚Äôll run into someone special :) 

Let go of the attachment to wanting to be noticed.

I‚Äôm 22 as well. If I‚Äôve learned anything yet it‚Äôs that when you let go of the pursuit of someone and give that stress to the universe (god, higher power, etc.) I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll feel a little better.

Good luck on your journey. This is a WEIRD time in our life‚Äôs where not much makes sense."

262,"Exactly this.  The number of times I've told someone to politely fuck off and they ignored me is enough for me to have learned that ghosting is way better for those kinds of people.

Also this to the rest of it."

265,Do you want to look back on your life for the next 60 years and be proud of who you are?
266,"If you are 14, then you definitely can take it as a compliment. Please kiss your teachers for me there in Latvia. You sentence structure is good throughout your post. You start sentences with ""but"" which is a common mistake even with native speakers. The way you express yourself in your post is not that of a 14 year old but rather an older person. Sorry for my skepticism but I have been teaching English for years to non native speakers and few have been able to write as well as you do."
267,"I have a pretty decent relationship with Mr. Blue. He's large and blue. He vibrates, but I can't be bothered with batteries and he's fine as is."
268,I never grew up with it being an insult but I definitely sympathize with those who did. I personally just don't like the people who use it as gay-erasure.
269,Agreed.   But I also think this is one reason why AGB is more interesting than GB.
270,That's very kind of you. Thank you. But it's not your fault and no need to apologize for others actions. But like anything else in life the negative gets around faster than the positive. And as I said earlier not all but a lot masc4masc are like that. I mean seriously read some of the BIOS and profiles on these dating apps. And you'll see what I'm talking about and it's not just them it's the community as a whole. The community is so divided its sad.

If you are young and or beautiful, guys may be very reluctant to approach you out of fear of rejection. Your best bet is to let them know you're interested. Say hi, ask if they want to do around, and take it from there.

Have a great time."
275,"Thank you! Everyone here is seems a tad judgy. I dated a girl and was absolutely in love with her but I knew I could never sexually be into her and to this day she's my best friend and I still love her, but in a different way now.

290,"A hot fellow bi guy on grindr was wearing one of these in his profile pic.  Better: he just moved into my building and was checking me out on the elevator hard.

You need good arms, pecs, and serratus to pull it off though."
291,"Well, let me offer this different view point: what about a straight, who enjoying getting head from a guy and that's it??

I've blown this redneck guy more times than I can count on both hands (fwb sorta?) We don't kiss, fuck, or cuddle.  He usually just wants a bj, and I oblige. He's watched straight porn while I blow him. He's even said he's ""straight mostly."" 

And I personally don't care.  He's hot AF and nice piece of meat between his legs. 

So does that make him bi? Probably. He's never actually said that he was. But it's just  a label. 

Just something to consider."
292,"I used to bother with fully body shaving: face, pits, chest, belly, pubes, ass and legs. Damn that's a lot of work ha ha Now, I'll just trim the pubes shave my face and chest. Seems to work well enough for me."
293,I understand what you‚Äôre saying but I honestly don‚Äôt feel 100% honest if I say I‚Äôm straight. I‚Äôm publicly straight but some people know why I‚Äôm technically bi.

298,"Well, I threw up over the side of the bed while getting fucked, does that count?"
299,"Man.... I always forget that for people in major cities 8 miles is a lot for a hookup.  I'm from the countryside &amp; 8 miles doesn't seem like anything.

But uh anyway why even entertain the dude if you're not interested in what he's offering.  If you want to fuck tell him you want to fuck.  And also his height has literally nothing to do with his sexual ability as a dom top &amp; you sound shallow as hell saying that."

308,"That is very strange if related. I think there wouldve a huge issue if the father found out his brother was fucking his son or daughter. 

Let's assume things were a bit different say the daughter or son was 18+ . . . Man it still doesnt fix that. If I were to have a son or daughter and I found out my brother fucked them I would be fucking livid. No matter their age and i would have a damaged relationship with my child and brother and our whole family would be awkward and in disarray."

310,Hope you know /s means sarcasm
311,A friend kiss is not high risk though.  We're gay for fuck's sake; we can kiss our friends on the mouth if we want.  I would advise against initiating tongue at this point though :P
312,"I worked in a convenience store throught high school / university. In the summer it was hard to avoid popping random boners at work. 

Fortunately, I don't think anyone noticed.

Later, once I became a teacher, it would happen between classes. Rather awkward having to adjust and hide behind my desk a bit. I was wearing dress pants, but you can still see the bulge. Hard to reach in and make adjustments in the middle of class.  Just had to wait them out for a few minutes."

322,"Yeah. September 18, 2005. 

I was 15 and had known myself along with a family friend who was my age as we‚Äôd done stuff with each other but I hadn‚Äôt came out to my parents. So I told them and my older sister on that date. 

I was happily surprised that they all took it well. My parents were cool with it and my sister was a bit over the top excited but it was thanks to her that I started a relationship with my first boyfriend later that month. 

My parents told me a while later that they had pretty much figured it out years before lol"
323,"I always thought the argument against incest was weak. It's definitely not my cup of tea, but I wonder if it's because I've been trained to think like that. It's not like we ban people who have a high risk of having unhealthy children from having them (e.g. older women, people with highly hereditary illnesses), so on what grounds are only incestous relationships banned? If you say that it is a law that came in place naturally in various human societies across various time periods to help preserve the human race, well then we as gays wouldn't be very welcome in that aspect as well as we don't contribute that much to the extension of a healthy human race, and have been similarly prosecuted in various societies historically."
