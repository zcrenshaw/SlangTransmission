1,"Your boyfriend is at least a little bit bisexual if he's wanting another dude's dick in his ass, let's be real about this. "
2,Just make sure the first thing you message us isnt BBC??Nothing turns me off faster than seeing that in the first message. Makes me not want to give it to you. Lol
3,"Why don‚Äôt you just not voice that preference and date who you like. If they happen to be black, keep those thoughts to yourself. I don‚Äôt think anyone wants to feel liked because of their race. With me for example, I find it unsettling to date black guys that exclusively date white guys. I feel weird like ‚Äúdoes he just like me cause I‚Äôm white üôÑ?‚Äù I‚Äôd much prefer a person who is truly ethnically blind and will date any color. "
4,Try grindr
5,"Sorry you feel that way. Hope that your attitude changes in the future. If I had a choice between being gay or being straight, I'd still choose gay."
6,"The drug is a reverse transcriptase inhibitor. HIV is an RNA virus, meaning it's genetic information is stored in RNA. This is unlike cellular genomes which are stored as DNA. However in order to make more copies of itself, the HIV genome must be turned into DNA. Reverse transcriptase facilitates this process and is encoded in the HIV genome. As for Truvadas presence in the human body, it is likely not in every cell, if any. HIV is known only to infect a specific blood cell type. Viruses often only infect a specific cell type. 

There is no chance that it is mutagenic and likely doesn't influence immune cell function. It is, as far as I understand, a molecular barrier to HIV. It has been extensively studied for side effects and these are vigilantly screened for in the clinic.

7,Low rise briefs or jockstraps only 
8,Natural brownish red :P
9,"This is about where I land. All my relationships have been with POC. Not planned. Just all the white guys ghosted - lol. I‚Äôm happy with any quality guy, any race or color. "
10,"If you're dating them for ""BBC"" or their ""thugness"", then you're fetishizing them. If you happen to be primarily attracted to the appearance of black people, Thats not fetishizing at all."
11,"It's only a perk for hook-up oriented guys. If you're more relationship oriented, like myself, it's not."
12,"It‚Äôs prevents people from contracting HIV and considering the stigma it‚Äôs what most people are concerned about.

You or anyone on prep should 100% use a condom when having sex with strangers "
13,I‚Äôm 24. I usually get hard without touching if I‚Äôm watching porn. I usually stay hard for a few mins if I stop touching unless I‚Äôm unusually tired or stressed. I also usually stay hard for 2-5mins after I get off
14,Ginger
15,"&gt; I have, however, found that some guys who are perfectly coherent and articulate in person cannot string together a proper sentence in writing to save their life. I have no idea why or how this happens, but it happens.

100% can confirm this. A few of my friends can easily articulate and speak on an intelligent level, but then text like a 14 year old valley girl. It makes zero sense. "
16,"As a gay Mexican man thank you.  

White guys usually have a hard time understanding or seeing racism in the gay community.   Thanks for understanding 

Not all white guys are bad but it seems to be whites that are more outwardly/vocally/written about ‚Äúpreferences‚Äù



"
17,I don‚Äôt have to take this asshole seriously just because he‚Äôs an older white guy with a tweed jacket and a Harvard pedigree. 
18,"+ Eeeeh? I don't agree that most white men are racist trash. Are there some that are yes! But most I have met seem to be pretty decent.  I think I should note that when I say most I have met. I mean...In actual non romantic daily interactions.

I have noticed that a lot of the complaints about gay white men being ""racist"" stem from other guys of diverse ethnic backgrounds butthurt because they want attention from gay white men particularly on grindr. And it is most specific in regards to white gay men &amp; their ""preference"" for their own kind. Which is kinda stupid because a) I see white men in relationships with Latin men (Lmao the shade) like all the time! &amp; b) Everyone has a type or preference (including these butthurt  ethnically diverse gay men that clearly are stuck on stupid &amp; must have a white man at all cost...And by cost I mean a loss of dignity). And further more mayyybe because I live in New York &amp; people here have zero hang ups about dating outside their race. I can't agree with OP's deduction. I have gotton hit on by white guys before. Im just not adventurous like that cuz I've seen one too many serial killer programs (Omggg!! thats fucking racist bro). üòÅüòÅüòÅ No but seriously. White guys scare me a little. 

Me? Yes, I have a type. But more importantly my preference is for whom ever is into me for me. The rest is just noise I dont have the time for. And maybe, perhaps one day I might work up the nerve to date a nice, boring, responsible, sane, white man. I just hope he don't throw me in a hole in his basement &amp; force me to rub lotion on myself so he can make a jock strap out of my skin. üòÇüòÇüòÅ Relax mofos, thats clearly a joke about Silence Of The Lambs."
19,"I knew a guy who said him and a friend had a flirtatious relationship for years, but we‚Äôre both in committed relationships. They joked if they were both single they would have sex in a hot tub full of jello. 

Ten years pass and one day it happened, they both had ended relationships within about a year of each other. The friend of the friend, asked him to come over to help him out. He got there and the guy and lined the hot tub with plastic, filled it with hundreds of packets of jello &amp; water. 

After they laughed, they went at it. My friend said it was weird at first but very sensual. 

It had too bad parts:

1. Cherry flavor stained their skin. They couldn‚Äôt leave the guys house for a couple days. 

2. Trying to throw all the jello away. Said garbage guys looked at the dozens of trash bag blobs very strangely. "
20,"Race play, joggers, cuffs, feet, role play, strangulation, spanking, guys in Pakistan and middle eastern clothing, army uniforms, police officers, play gang rapes. "
21,"Yeah, it'd be a deal breaker for me üòï"
22,"Nothing clinical, but two thoughts to offer:  almost everyone loves English spoken with a French accent. It sounds melodic... Then you need to keep this in your mind at all times - people are just people. The old saying that ‚Äúhe puts his pants on one leg at a time‚Äù is true. Everyone sits on a toilet and has to wipe their own ass. Rich or poor, educated or not, we all seek much the same for ourselves and our families. In person or on the phone they come to you with a need, with a question, with a concern. Just try and see them as that... someone you can help with an answer or directing them to the next step. Treat them with courtesy and dignity and you will do fine.  You‚Äôre up to this!"
23,Nope. 
24,"Everyone sees the obvious agenda you are perpetuating on this sub, as well as the multiple accounts you use.

If you are not paid for your disinformation, you need to ask yourself some serious questions about why you are behaving this way.  You‚Äôre not well mentally.  "
25,please let us have an update OP! I'm rootin for ya
26,"Yeah, why not?"
27,"&gt;  straight passing

I mean, it's right there in the descriptor. If you call yourself ""straight passing"" it's because you want people to think you're straight. 
"
28,That‚Äôs tough then! Be strong my friend. Just know strangers all over the world are thinking about you and rooting for you. Hopefully your family comes around. 
29,"I had a friend tell that once, then he asked me out after him and his girlfriend broke up. I told him I wasn't interested, (because he's a sleazeball) and he didn't want to talk to me unless he was bored, so I just stopped talking to him completely.
"
30,Right on the money.
31,Technically it's not pre-marital if you just never get married...
32,Briefs all the way. 
33,"Dude, it's a priest fucking a boy. If this is not hypocrisy then I do not know what is."
34,"Cruel but straight to the point, lol!"
35,thongs are underrated 
36,I take it they aren‚Äôt convinced it‚Äôs not a choice?
37,"Funny you should post this today... I‚Äôve heard guys who go their lives wearing jockstraps and I‚Äôve always been scared to do that. For many reasons. But now I‚Äôm living on my own and no one can stop me! So typically I‚Äôm a boxer briefs/trunks kind of guy, but today I decided to wear a jockstrap. Freedom I feel in the back makes me feel sexy and I really like it. I want to get used to the feeling and kind of ease into wearing them more. It‚Äôs a little colder where I live but when it warms up I wanna rock a jock more often. "
38,"The one near me honestly is. They‚Äôre still fit, but... They have a good mix."
39,First same-sex relationship was when I was 24
40,"As a PoC I gotta say, I know that not all white people are racist, but white guilt  is not a good look either."
41,"hey! i know the  feeling. have lived quite a few years here in chicago and, though it's been great, have been bored for quite some time. have begun making plans to move to new england which i think suits my flinty personality better than midwestern affability. lol.
"
42,Contracting HIV
43,That‚Äôs awesome that your dad chose you and your mother over their opinion! No one should be placed in that position with an ultimatum like that. 
44,"Thanks for sharing those thoughts I'll try to keep that in mind, those are good advices :) "
45,Would you say it's by choice?
46,Red hair baby all the way
47,Best 
48,"Probably female-female crossdressing. This involves a gal attempting to appear as if she's a guy trying to dress like a woman. I have no idea what to make of it, but it's out there."
49,"Well considering that it protects against many strains of HIV, it is *safer* by a relative measure.  

Is it *safe*? No. "
50,"Oh whoops, I was actually talking about posts in this subreddit XD"
51,"Why the downvote? Someone mentioned ""taking control of your health."" This is OP's decision. Yes it's definitely not a good sign that OP is worried his partner will cheat... but it would be even worse if he was right and failed to protect himself and take control over his own health. It's your body. Trust your instinct."
52,"You know a way to get syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia besides condomless anal sex? Condomless oral sex. They all spread very easily that way, as does herpes. Condoms also don‚Äôt provide reliable protection from herpes or HPV. "
53,[removed]
54,Yeah people are kinda brutal on here
55,Continue to see your doctor. He spent several years in school learning just for this very reason. 
56,"Too easy, just go about your business as usual, go to gay bars with your girlfriend as you do usually do, when approached again by someone you find attractive then suggest that you would experiment with him as long as it includes your gf to your M√©nage √† trois, there problem solved. Your welcome!"
57,"If he discover it, he will think you bareback behind his back.
I understand it is hard to ask to come back to condoms, but you could ask him about your fears.
Anyway if you can't ask him to use condom, and you have some fear, take the prep. "
58,[deleted]
59,"Just enough contact to say I‚Äôm back and let me know when you‚Äôd like to get together. Not too pushy, not too clingy. Shows confidence with the assumption that he wants to, but puts the ball in his court. Then leave it alone. "
60,Silver and short
61,"I am from Razgrad, Bulgaria. "
62,No u

64,"Nope.  Nothing wrong with liking ass play, but the moment you decide you rather have real dick over toys, you gotta turn in the straight card."
65,"+1 Under Armour, these things are great for sports and daily usage, best underwear I ever had"
66,"Omg you are are so disgustingly GAY!!!!  

If I had emotions I‚Äôd be jealous, but I think I‚Äôm dead inside. I‚Äôve been seeing a great guy for the past month or so. 4-5 days per week. We buy or cook each other dinner, I stay at his place on the weekends, we enjoy psychedelic drugs together, AND he‚Äôs got a big huge fat... rock collection? And he knows how to use it. He‚Äôs like my perfect dream boyfriend if I had such a thing. But I have absolutely zero desire to date him or anyone else.  

What‚Äôs it like to feel things?"
67,"Death Grips

I've gotten a couple of weird comments about it"
68,"You don't really get to speak on behalf of anyone but yourself, mate.

It's okay to be white."
69,"You? Yes, I can see you being single forever. "
70,"Well if that‚Äôs the case then ask him, what‚Äôs the worse thing he says? No! Also at some point one of you might catch feelings so also take that into consideration. "
71,"I live in the beautiful Washington state. 
I've lived all over the US and there's no place like it here. "
72,Beliefs but commando most of the time. 
73,"Dude that's awesome that you did that and that he didn't freak out on you. 
Why can't all guys be like that? Just flattered that you asked even if it ain't their cup of tea? "
74,"Obviously are amazing. I only have one pair of briefs from them, but they‚Äôre my favorite. Also Andrew Christian almost naked are pretty great as well"
75,"I had a similar bromance, same thing was said as yours. Nothing ever came of it. Don't act on it either as it's not worth losing a friend. "
76,"This is a tough one... personally, having just come out of a 5 year relationship where I found out my partner met up with his ex-boyfriend and lied to me about it, I agree with the stance of protecting yourself. My advice would be to take it.

Ideally it should be 100% open communication about things like that - if you have trust issues or worry about him cheating on you, it may be worth talking about. I was on the other end with my ex. I didn't trust him at all and made that pretty clear after finding some texts 2 years ago, forgave him, and gave him another chance. Lo and behold, years later he did it again.

My point is that it's hard to 100% know anyone (I'm a bit pessimistic right now) and given such serious health risks he could expose you to, the fact that you're already a bit worried given his sex drive and the distance, and your correct viewpoint that it's your body and you can do what you want. Taking PREP is not hurting him. But again, my username is love\_is\_h3ll."
77,"arrrrghhhh! no--i can't remember the 2 which were standouts but, in one, the mother asks point-blank and unexpectedly if her son's a top or bottom; in the other, the guy listens to a cassette tape on how to act gay and, while following the steps, impressively transforms into a roaring flamer. oh, hell, just google and check things out. it might be more fun that way. :-D


"
78,"Conversation went like this ‚Äòhey um I‚Äôm not sure which way you‚Äôre inclined but I think you‚Äôre cute and would like to take you out to dinner‚Äô 

Then he replied
‚ÄòOh thanks that‚Äôs honestly really nice but I do have a girlfriend currently, thanks for the offer though‚Äô

Then I said something like 
‚ÄòOh haha seems I need to tweak my Gaydar lol‚Äô"
79,"&gt;yearning to move to the UK...

Your timing is not great. I'll trade places if you like though üòÅ"
80,Why did you go straight to insults? Do you need to put other people down to feel better about yourself? Sure seems like this thread hit a nerve.
81,"Thank you for your answer, you‚Äôve explained things very clearly. I remember learning about transcription from DNA to RNA in high school chemistry. Is reverse transcriptase needed for any other function in the body apart from HIV replication? Is there a downside to blocking this? Like, would a healthy person‚Äôs body ever need to transcribe RNA to DNA if no viruses are present?"
82,"You make a nice point, I don‚Äôt think he would‚Äôve told you about it if he didn‚Äôt mean to see you ever again. 
I think you should text him something along the lines of ‚Äòhey, I‚Äôm back tomorrow. Do you wanna hang out or something?‚Äô 
You don‚Äôt have anything to lose and a lot to gain, so just do it :) 

I hope everything turns out fine and you guys hit it off, lemme know afterwards though :P "
83,"Prince Edward Island. Smallest province of Canada. Beautiful place with great beaches, rich potato farms and red soil"
84,Briefs
85,"I like boxer-briefs with longer legs for working out / strenous activity and briefs / jocks for the look and feel. Except when the strap ends up twisted, that's annoying.."
86,"Immediately: Fill and empty your lungs completely 10 times. If you‚Äôre not calmer after that then keep repeating until you are physically calmed down. 

Exercise. 

There is a direct connection to physical excitement and emotional excitement(think fight or flight when someone scares you) so physically releasing your pent up energy WILL help. 

ASAP: Talk to friends. On the phone or as face to face as possible. 

Spend time on hobbies. 

Also, and this may take some intense work with a therapist and introspection, remember that you will get through a break up if that is the case. It is not a reflection of your worth or you as a person. Life just happens. 

I am a huge advocate for people getting into therapy, so I would encourage that for some long term results. "
87,It's okay to be Serbian.
88,I've never tried them. But maybe I'll get a few. 
89,"are u asking for titles of books and movies, or are you focused on real life? if it's the former, check out ""call me by your name"" (the book's better than the movie, although timothee chalamet's worth the price of entry).
"
90,I think u need 2 sit down and talk to him. One on one and go over the dos and donts. Of you see him talking 2 someone and they give you a bad vibe then let him know. And vice versa. I am not here 2 judge you as I get turned on by some shit that pple might frown upon as well. But just be honest and your feelings do matter. Good luck man
91,"Are you me? Am I you? This is written, and I read it, as if it were my life RN. Every detail of this. Except for the failed regimes bit. The corruption, I won't even. üòí"

3. Minimal coverage for better air flow / air conditioning
4. Eliminates swamp ass"
97,"I wear briefs, jocks, and thongs. Boxer briefs aren't bad but I don't feel sexy in them"
98,You should cut down on watching porn and masturbating. If it doesn't help then yeah definitely go ahead and see a doctor. 
99,"I agree with that - it is very easy to get laid.

&gt;I told him it‚Äôs only easy if you‚Äôre willing to lower your standards lmao.

Your standards might be too high then. Because it's incredibly easy to hookup with guys that are at least on the same level as yourself."
100,I keep forgetting Washington exist and I live in America. I feel so damn ashamed

102,Never tried them. I've heard they're great though. 
103,Brown and black.
104,"Haha which is fair. But then because some people are so brazenly fetishizing you guys it makes me almost embarrassed about that just being a slight, harmless preference "
105,"It's cute that your flair says ""no snowflakes"" when you're the one who feels attacked 'cause someone said trying to pass for straight was a waste of time and energy."
106,"Ha.  I meant musky smell, not shit. "
107,They‚Äôre projecting their own view of what a FWB is rather than acknowledging different people feel differently about those relationships 
108,Yeah because the only repercussion is a downvote lol
109,"Well it takes a little more work than complaining on reddit and can be difficult but yeah, actually it does. "
110,"If you're unsure, it's time to talk about it. He might not care or he might care a lot. There's no finding that out without asking."
111,"Naw, I keep them at home and in the car but not on me. "
112,Actually you‚Äôre right dammit 
113,Green Day
114,"yes.  And at some point make him aware that you're into dudes either directly ""btw, I'm gay"" or indirectly ""man, that dude on TV is hot"".  

Sometimes, at this window/conversation the other guy will be ""oooooh.  that's cool"" and then provide their own orientation in some weird show of reciprocity."
115,Just tell him you have a boyfriend. 
116,"Even with the NSFW, I was not prepared for this. Time to go search Shawn Mendes‚Äô Calvin Klein picture. "
117,"""wau"" a recent new one for me. The chat didn't last long."
118,You mean coitus?
119,"I'm gay (lost my virginity to a woman and quickly confirmed my suspicions) and I can tell you that sometimes when I'm scrolling down /r/all in the morning and it's filled with porn, many times I'll click a link and it's a naked woman or a woman showing her breasts fall out of her clothing. And even though I'm certifiably gay, sometimes I look at the picture or gif and think ""She has nice boobs"" or ""Her butt is shaped nice"". Hell I've even seen some vaginas that made me think ""Well that looks awfully inviting"" (üòÇ) 

Point is,I don't think that makes me any less gay. I know that I'm not interested in sex with a woman because I tried it and didn't enjoy it. I know that I don't want to touch those boobs or suck on the nipples. But I don't think I'm any less gay for admiring a pretty woman. You shouldn't feel any less straight for admiring the male form. Just because you can say that a guy has a nice chest or arms doesn't mean you want to have sex with him. I don't think there's anything wrong with you at all and I'd wager that most people occasionally see someone of the same sex and think ""That guy is handsome"" or ""She is really pretty"". Seems normal to me. My 2¬¢ at least. "
120,"I feel your pain, man. Me penis is so large that whenever I get an erection I pass out due to a lack of blood flow. I wish my penis was smaller. "
121,"I eat pretty healthy ~~im vegan~~ and I have a bulb. Like I said, I stay pretty perfectly clean during long sessions but some times shit happens, no pun intended, so I‚Äôm just looking for different ways or new things to try lmao. Thank you!!"
122,Not necessarily illegal. It depends where this is.
123,"he's got a girlfriend i bet she doesn't kiss him, mwah"
124,"You should just burn that bridge and move on. Friends come and go; there's no rule that they have to last forever. She's gonna be stuck in that town sulking while you're out happily living your life. I had a best friend in high school and after but we had to stop being friends since she became an energy vampire and got herself into bad situations all the time. Just think about the better, more mature people you will meet."
125,"Don't worry about it, mate. I'm a top, but love a cock in my mouth. Also, recently been enjoying having my bf finger me while I want. There's so many variations of different roles and positions so best not to fret about what you *should* be enjoying and just get stuck in! :)"
126,"You are exactly right. For me, it's mostly emotional and mental reasons keeping me from living my life. I didn't start to really want to explore my sexuality until October of last year, and now I've realized just what I've done to myself over the years. While I know better, it's still hard to get myself to stand up and believe that I am not worthless or an abomination, as a lot of my friends and family would say. 

The good thing is that she is pretty fit to care for the kids. I support them by being a parent figure alongside my mom, so I don't do anything that she can't do other than manage the finances, help with their education, and drive them around.

At the same time, I don't want my mom to struggle because I decided to go out and do something that benefits me. There's that awful mentality creeping up again! It's just so hard to put myself first. Hopefully, I'll have a positive experience with the therapist and can work through some of this. "
127,Face is important so
128,You're fucking got as shit
129,"Mono isn‚Äôt herpes. HSV-1 and HSV-2 are STDs, mono isn‚Äôt an STD, because you can get it from someone as simple as a water fountain. It‚Äôs spread by saliva."

131,There's so many people the odds of meeting him are slim
132,In theory I can. In my case I can't.
133,"Possibly unfortunately for you, it doesn't work that way. You won't necessarily be thrilled by sex with men just because women aren't giving you the time of day. Feel free to give it a try. I'm just saying that you might be disappointed."
134,"Thanks, I was just a bit worried that I was becoming dependent on sucking cock for a good time, and if that was unusual or not. Pretty new to all this lol."
135,"I'm in relationship, why would I need a condom for random occasion?"

143,"It‚Äôs just sex!

Just don‚Äôt do anything you might regret and enjoy yourself!"
144,"Thank you so, so much for sharing your experience and advice!

I wish I had time to say more right now. My feelings are even more complicated at the moment just for the fact that he pulled me close to him in bed as I was waking up this morning. He kissed my face and hands, and in those moments I felt safe and in love, forgetting for about 30 mins that he treats me like a chump 90% of the time. If I walked away from him today, I don't think he would shed a tear or beg me to stay; he'd reach out to his attention supply and have someone else in his bed to replace me in short order. I'm so disposable at the end of the day, and that's what hurts the most right now. 

Anyways, thank you again. All of these posts are exactly what I needed to see this morning.

147,I like people like him in the Democratic primary because it exposes the republican-lite candidates
148,Yeah sorry for not being clear on that.
149,We didn‚Äôt have sex. We made out and he wanted to do tongue so I did. I‚Äôm so pissed at him.
150,Well it‚Äôs up to you ultimately. Take what your friends and what we say to mind but don‚Äôt let those words be the only guiding light. Figure out the pros and cons and try and picture yourself on that position. Take the plunge into unknown territory if you want. Worst case scenario you decide to leave the job and you‚Äôll have come out stronger and with a better idea of what your limits are as a person. You can really only grow more from this experience.
151,It just feels weird to think about having a virus for the rest of my life. I have to tell my parents and I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôll judge me.
152,"Ok. This is going to sound rough, but you really need to hear it. You need to get this out of your head that you are inadequate. Less than 1/100 sons would take in his family and support them financially. Your house is YOUR house. You do not owe them anything if they do not accept you for something outside of your control. When they find out, they can choose to stay or not. To be honest, I don't think your mom is in any position to make choices when SHE is the burden for you. This guy who wrote this comment thinks you are some 16 year old without anything to your name. Your sisters will be fine regardless of whether they stay with you or not. On top of that, if your mom is unfit to serve as a legal guardian, I am sure you could fight for custody of them easily. You are not weak and you put up with way too much shit because you've been taught to hate yourself. "
153,"I hate to say it but you probabaly didn't have close connections because you weren't real with people. You were doing an act and maintaining your emotional distance from everyone, even without realising it I think. You could try and spend some more quality time in smaller groups, or just hang out more. "

There is a happy medium between showing no interest in a relationship and being overbearing. I would get annoyed with a daily good morning text. Some guys would love that level of attention. 

As always, there is nothing wrong with communicating about communication preferences. "
157,Never heard of it
158,I love the fact that many people aren't getting this. üòÇ
159,What is mono?
160,"But it‚Äôs not harmless because I‚Äôve been sick for over a month. As in fever, mildly sore throat and swollen tonsil for a few days and swollen lymph nodes."
161,"No, though haven't opened my app for ages. Not out of any self esteem or stuff like that, but just kinda got bored. Seeing the same dudes around and stuff like that. Though if on a trip someplace I'll open it up to see who's around.


Also I don't mind random hookups, but I don't have the time for them anymore. Days I do have the free time I'd rather catch up on relaxing and gaming. We pretty much plan slut vacations to let us let loose a bit."
162,"&gt;Mono stays with you for life

So does chicken pox. Who cares? You really are reaching for things to feel sorry for yourself about."
163,Maybe I am naive but I would like to believe every person who is fairly reasonable knows that the jussie incident doesn't prove that actual hate crimes don't happen and that all victims are liars. If anything this made people more cautious to not take sides unless there's (further) evidence. 
164,'sup?
165,"So why date, then?  "
166,"&gt; For a while he was less active on here...

Ahh, the good ole days."
167,"I enjoyed night shifts at amazon when I worked there. 6:30 pm to 5 am in the morning and I enjoyed it quite a lot as long as you have somewhere quiet to sleep. The most stressful thing I found was being woken up by people who don't understand that 2 am in the afternoon is the equivilent of their 4 am in the morning!! leave me sleep! 

9 pm till 7 am doesn't sound that bad to be perfectly honest. Come home at 7, either go to bed or chill out for an hour or two, go to sleep at about 9 / 10 am or earlier, get full 8 hours sleep and you'll have a few hours to mull around in the evening to get stuff done. it really doesn't seem that bad to me. i'd take it anyday"
168,"WTF is wrong with you, seriously. You need some professional help. Where does this agony about having a ""virus for the rest of my life"" come from? It makes no sense. Your body is teeming with bacteria and viruses, that's what it means to be a living organism. Who the fuck cares if one more is added to the pile if it literally has no effect on your health? What you're complaining about is so scientifically ignorant it's devastating to read."
169,What is gay 2020?
170,"Ugh the things I would do to you, boy"
171,If I'm being honest... I'd want you to pin me up against the wall. üëÄ
172,"I‚Äôm with you. I think it‚Äôs impact is overstated.

I can‚Äôt think of any other incidents where someone staged a hate crime for attention / false sympathy. It‚Äôs a bizarre isolated incident. "
173,OMG the resemblance to a turtle is uncanny lol.
174,"Don't shit where you eat.

This sounds messy as hell.  Unless you have a backup living situation, I would just leave it alone and keep things platonic.

Maybe bring up his boyfriend more often.  ""How is Y doing?""   ""When is your anniversary?""  ""what are you two doing for valentine's day?""  ""Do you miss Y?""  "
175,I never carry one with me. I have sex less than once a year.
176,I don't because I don't have casual sex lol so literally no reason to carry one.
177,"That's a pretty small, albeit seemingly functional, wallet. "
178,How are you going to start college when you haven‚Äôt finished high school?
179,"See that's the thing I'm not trying to manufacture a moment.
I follow the energy they put in and reciprocate it back.
What I'm saying is that the guy shows significant amount of interest in the first interaction and conversation and once that moment ends (i.e. it's late or we've already spoken for 1.5 hours) it seems to always die there.

The conversations or interactions that follow next suddenly feel like they have 0 interest or enthusiasm.
I'm just trying to figure out why because it's the same thing happening everytime and I can't figure out what happens all the time between the first interaction and the literally the next one that feels like I'm talking to 2 different people."
180,Not sure why you got downvoted but I agree with you. I don‚Äôt really remember the people I message unless they respond and we meet up.
181,"I get treated the moment I found out, guys. It has long gone but I much as I know, it‚Äôs there and can resurface anytime, that‚Äôs why I was afraid.

Anyway, thank for your advice. Will tell him and try to be funny about it LOL"
182,"My point is, when you throw the ""Nigerian"" narrative, you are pin pointing to the fact they are African Mandingo Warriors that just hoped on the plane here.

That isn't the case. These guys are African American actors with Nigerian roots. That's all. "
183,I wish there was a hybrid word for the two. 
184,"Maybe give it a shot with a guy.

I don't think you see yourself romantically involved with a man because society tells us men belong with women.  If it was normal to date men or women, people would not be so conflicted.

Experiment with a guy sexually if you can and see what it's like.  "
185,"Yeah  nobody knows who this McSwiggan guy is. There's a huge difference between a gay Youtuber and an actor who is on a primetime TV show on a major network. 

We don't need to invent conspiracy theories about secret societies and ""ritual shit"" to find an answer for what Smollett did. He's a racist attention whore with a sick desire to be seen as a victim, it's pretty simple. "
186,It‚Äôs the eyelashes that I don‚Äôt like. 
187,"Posting pictures of you rejecting people is rude, but I don‚Äôt see why whether they complain about Grindr is relevant. OP could have just complained about people who post screenshots of them rejecting people (although that is a pretty rare thing - I didn‚Äôt know people did that). "
188,"Slytherin is all bottoms, half being the nasty, bitchy/queeny type and half DL cheating on their girlfriends.

Hufflepuff is mostly chill stoner bottoms.

Gryffindor is mostly type-A tops and some bottoms but they‚Äôre all vers.

Ravenclaw is mostly bookish submissive tops."
189,Sounds like someone who hasn't actually listened to any of the candidates 
190,"We've been through this before. When you're the only child being homeschooled, of course you're going to have the highest IQ. "
191,"I find unnecessary texting very annoying.  I want to focus on what is going in around me. If there is something to be said that is important, great but just texting for the sake of making sure someone is still out there is tedious.  A good morning once in awhile or a thinking of you after awhile is just fine, but everyday seems a bit much. 

Remember when you start dating someone, you are a new variable in their schedule. It will take time for you to work onto their schedule more often. They may have family commitments or vacations or events or work that was on their schedule before you. That is normal. "
192,"It's very difficult.  Many of this struggled with this earlier in life.  

What are you most afraid of?"
193,Make sure you use a straw.
194,"Your ethnicity is where your bloodline is from.
Race is based on your skin color 
&amp; nationality is place of birth. 

‚ÄúAfrican Chinese‚Äù ok. "
195,"As long as you're not leading these men on and are upfront that you're just trading nude pics, and those pics are indeed of you and you are over 18 I don't see anything wrong with it."
196,"Really happy for you dude, I'm also in the ME and pretty much in the same boat as you. It's not always as bad as it seems... Anyway, I'm down to chat as well if you ever wanna talk. Cheers!"
197,You‚Äôve seriously never heard of a wet dream before?
198,Sit on my face with that hairy ass u may have! 
199,"No. 

They're both dead. "
200,":(

Sorry for your loss"
201,"No, I‚Äôm 18 too and I do that too, it‚Äôs exciting and that‚Äôs the truth, there‚Äôs no shame in having some fun and excitement, if you want someone your age to hookup with let it be known on there, or you could try tinder, there tends to be guys on there who are looking to date and maybe you‚Äôll lose your virginity and get a bf so a double win"
202,"It's something that teenage boys do. I remember back in high school it was the cool thing to have a condom in your wallet at all times ""just in case."" 

In reality, most adults who are sexually active will have condoms at home. Unless you're someone who plans on have sex in a car or an alleyway somewhere, I don't see a reason to need a condom on your person at all times. "
203,Just be careful not to include your face in your nudes or that shit will turn up on a porn site and could ruin your future career or be seen by people you know.
204,"With all due respect, if you can't think of any, you aren't looking very hard.  Don't you remember the lesbian who alleged rape by dyke hating rednecks?  Who was caught on camera doing the graffiti on her own dorm room?  Gosh, there have been dozens of such proven false accusations over the last eight years.  Far more false accusations than proven hate crimes."
205,... is this a joke? Like ur hot as fuck dude chill lmfao
206,Most bottoms Hufflepuff most tops Slytherin or Gryffindor
207,Stop the nonsense! Beautiful body!
208,"It doesn't matter to me one bit what a candidate's sexual orientation is. Whether s/he can govern and has the experience to do so, matters a great deal to me. No more ""I'm not a politician"" politicians. Of course what their platform is matters to me also. But I would ever vote for a candidate simply because s/he were gay."
209,How can you not have an email? Do they work? Like.... Even to pay bills.... I don't understand. 
210,Your bi probably. Im 13 too. Welcome to the club.
211,I feel like I am considered attractive but I lack sex appeal. 
212,"I believe it's about personal preference, but it can also be media putting this into your mind, kinda like the stereotype that all gay guys are super muscular and built  which adds to it.

I'm kinda the same as you I guess, I know it doesn't matter but I get the need to workout to help with my confidence even though it's all about personality that (most) people are focusing on/want.

If someone is going to date you just because of your body type, then let's say you gain a few pounds, would they still love you? The relationship would end fast and not be a healthy one at best.

Hope this helps."
213,He's basically a discount Bernie. He holds nearly the same political positions - with less commitment.
214,"Mono shouldn‚Äôt stay with you for life... it‚Äôs like a more severe flu honestly, it‚Äôs a short term illness."
215,I feel like ravenclaws are vers
216,There are multiple types of albinism. Only some present with the pinkish iris. I‚Äôve seen some with normal blue irises and some with such pale blue irises that they appear pink in certain light. 
217,"..or a remote. This isn't 1970. There are more than 3 channels on TV. If you don't like what's on, change the station. Or go get some fresh air. "
218,I'll try that
219,Uhm yeah?... ask those gays who never had a relationship and ended up alone forever in their 80s...
220,"Lordy, it sure does. I was in college. Some bros threw a remembrance party and ended up being shown on CNN. Lol. Someone sent them video or a pic and CNN showed it. "
221,People either love bernie or hate bernie. I like him but i like elizabeth warren more. I have nothing against the guy it‚Äôs just that i had so many bad experiences with bernie‚Äôs supporters in the 2016 election when i was campaigning for hillary that it just sorta soiled him for me a bit
222,He looks like he could be Mitch McConnell's inbred cousin
223,"Sexy, I love the hair. Give the gym more time, you'll notice more progress but it takes months, make sure you're doing compound exercises and avoiding machines if you can."
224,"Sean Connery, the original James Bond. Class, brawn and sex appeal."
225,"Theres definitely some muscle definition, just not a ton."
226,I feel like hufflepuffs would always be vers
227,"I wanted too!  When I was 17 I fell passionately in love with my karate instructor.  I did everything my virginal mind could think of to seduce him.  Stayed after the class to strike sexy poses while showering.  He quit taking showers after class.  Always leaping to be the one to partner with him for stretch exercises.  (One on occasion during which I felt his most impressive erection through the karate uniform.)  He stopped doing stretch exercises.  I hit him above the belt, I hit him below the belt, I hit him with the belt!  Nothing doing.

Three years latter in my first gay bar who walks in with his lover, but my karate instructor.  His lover was me 15 years on.  At one point the lover actually came over to me and said, ""is this the one?  He is cute as a button!""  My former instructor had the decency to blush along with me.

His honorable behavior made a great impression on me.  From that time forward I have known that gay men can and do keep their oaths, and can and do act honorably towards the young.  Even when the young put on the full Mata Hari act.  There are loads of good men in our community.  Goodness just doesn't get a lot of attention."
228,"Tastes change over time. Eventually, you'll become bored by whatever you're currently interested in and you'll begin to appreciate other flavors. "
229,I‚Äôd trim the mane a bit but overall u fine
230,Trolling for compliments.
231,@ultra_nox
232,"Nah, if it makes you happy then keep doing it. I‚Äôd be sure to properly vet them before you send pics though. Also, don‚Äôt feel pressure to conform to any societal norms. "
233,"&gt;Because I don't see any reason for him to make this up.

The Chief of the Chicago Police said his motive was that Jussie felt he wasn't being paid enough for his role on Empire. He sent himself the fake hate letter with the white powder and threatening message, and when nobody cared he invented the fake hate crime to get more attention.

He made this whole thing up because of greed.

"
234,"That's a great outlook, and you articulated it very nicely. I do agree that finding a significant other is only a small part of life, and while it's not a necessity, it's a good addition nonetheless... Wish you all the best, hope you find happiness wherever it may be."
235,"We are in the same situation, except I'm in Europe (Still struggling with this issue since I'm religious)

Did you leave Islam or are you trying to be both? just curious."
236,"Aw, thanks! "
237,I want to lol but im really anxious 
238,"Except *you're* the one who made it about age by highlighting the *guys all over 50 years old*.

Age has nothing to do with sexual violation."
239,"People don‚Äôt refer to mono as herpes. Chickenpox is also a herpes virus, but people don‚Äôt refer to it as simply ‚Äúherpes‚Äù because it would be confusing. "
240,"Huge Jackman since I was a kid. I didn't know I was gay at that point, but I wanted to hug him and be held by him. "
241,If you don't bait the hook you're not going to get a good catch
242,"That's the thing, it's never happened to me through puberty but I guess I was pretty horny last night then :/"
243,"I think my ass looks hotter when its smooth, but I also get A LOT of tops saying they want smooth hole so I do it for both reasons"
244,Finish what you started. Your instinct was right now you need resolve.
245,"Race is based on physical appearance. Ethnicity is based on lineage. Nationality is based on place of birth and citizenship. 

'African' is an ethnicity or nationality. Black is a race."
246,"Their parents were from Nigeria. The brothers flew to Nigeria the very same day after they staged the attack. A lot of people who are the children of immigrants identify with the country of their parent's origin. There are plenty of people who are the children of Mexican immigrants who calls themselves ""Mexican"" even though they weren't born in Mexico. I know Chinese, Indian, Korean people, etc who will call themselves that because their parents are from those countries, even though they've never even set foot there. 

If you look at the Instagram page of the brothers, you can see that they identify as Nigerian. Look up @team_abel and you will clearly see the ""NG"" on their profile to represent Nigeria. 

I'm sorry, but you don't get to gatekeep someone else's ethnicity. If they choose to say they are Nigerian, then who are you to tell them otherwise? It seems like you are the one who's being the racist here, dictating how other people are allowed to identify themselves. "
247,"No, but my back does. Lift with your legs, son. "
248,"how do so many of ya---actually, never mind. i already know why so many of y'all don't know anything about how your bodies work. it's not your fault.

anyway, totally normal to have a wet dream. please go find ""our bodies, ourselves"", the version for males, and learn about your genitals. "
249,Real talk: leave him alone.....
250,"This is fantastic to hear. My hope for your generation and the ones that come after - hell, for anyone, really - it is that we will realize that true, satisfying connection comes from one-on-one, vulnerable relationships with real humans. Not images on a screen, not the photos and words we carefully curate for one another - flesh and blood connections that require feelings and experiences to flourish. 

You realizing that you are responsible for your own happiness and self-worth is huge, and your dedication to working on that is even bigger. Someday, maybe, when you love the person you are and have found purpose in your life, you‚Äôll attract the right person. Maybe not, but at that point it‚Äôll be okay because you and the friends you make along the way will love the person you‚Äôve become. "
251,k
252,"Your body is pretty much PERFECT. The only thing I can say is that I don't care for the body hair, but that's just my preference. Tons of guys love body hair and think it's hot as fuck. "
253,it is during puberty but there's no reason it couldn't happen as an adult if you're horny enough.
254,Or overly hairy ‚¨ÜÔ∏èüòÅ
255,Brad Pitt in Fight Club. Hands down
256,I would not
257,Ugh that sucks! They can‚Äôt just give you a taste and then cut you off. How was his dick?
258,"Ah, nice. Yeah, big fan of One Piece, but I'm super behind right now. "
259,"Uhhh, you can find someone attractive without seeing their face. And also he asked for honest opinions, and that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs getting. Idk what your issue is."
260,Get that dick and don‚Äôt feel bad about it. Use condoms for anal every single time. 
261,"These are stupid questions.

They look like a pale person who's nude. 

Yes."
262,Human affection. Sex is a human need and I‚Äôll just end up raw dogging a trane or something 
263,"It's not just me. I talked with my friends when I started having problems dating him (nice that I actually have this option) and they told me about their similar experiences and how horrible it was for them too. 

People don't just have no friends for no reason. There's always a reason and it's always negative. "
264,Oh werq science fish. 
265,Alexander Skarsg√•rd or Joe Maginello from *True Blood*. 
266,Confused how a Bernie supporter has to ask this question. Pick just about any Democratic senator or congressperson and chances are they're republican-lite millionaires who greatly profit from the current system just like their Republican peers. The party is kind of changing as progressive people put more pressure on them but they fight even the tamest policies tooth-and-nail because they know it means they'll lose out on $$$ while everyday moral and regular people they're supposed to be representing barely float by and too often drown.
