0,I really don't- or rather just can't quite come to terms with how any right winger can think that the right wing has anything except contempt or hate for LGBT+ people
1,Thank you for sharing this. Corporate allies and their visibility benefits the community as a whole by reaching the homes and minds of those who might otherwise never be forced to address the fact that we exist and we have a right to happiness and love.
2,"I'm 5'6"", half asian/white, a twink, and prefer to top. It has always been a little disheartening getting turned down for being too short or not masc enough for some bottoms :("
3,"Debate is healthy. It's not complaining, it's concern.

Just recently YouTube touted inclusivity through celebration of pride month via cute rainbow graphics. YouTube also refused to close down hate speech, white supremacists channels, and directed bullying of LGBT individuals.

Rainbow capitalism is the visibility without the equality with the added benefit of predatory behavior. 

They want your money and your faith."
4,"That‚Äôs happened to me. I was out with a group of people (a mix of friends ,including my BF at the time, and friends of friends). At my end of the table people started talking about pride, the lgbt community ect. I‚Äôm out but people who don‚Äôt know me usually don‚Äôt guess that I‚Äôm into dudes until I or someone else says something. I have my opinions on pride and this girl called me homophobic. My bf had been at the bar ordering a drink and came back right after she made the comment and I said ‚Äúwell do you want to tell my boyfriend or should I‚Äù. She stayed quiet the rest of the night."
5,"What they said was completely inappropriate and unprofessional. You tried to tell them it made you uncomfortable and they ignored your request. If anything like that happens again go immediately to Human Resources and file a complaint against them and your boss, who was present but didn‚Äôt react. Good luck!  You deserve to feel safe and respected at work."
6,"My husband has always been on the beefy side, which I *really* like but he gets insecure about sometimes. I call it my 10% extra free üòÅ"
7,"Virtually every member of my family said the same things to me.  When asked why I didn't tell them, I looked them in the eye and said, ""Because you go on and on saying AIDS is God's punishment for people choosing to be gay"".  They have all been left sucking air at that point.  Many have never put down gays again.  Sometimes people do learn when confronted by their deeds."
8,I hate it when people ask me ‚Äúwhat have you been up to‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat do you like to do‚Äù like the hell if I know.
9,"Same with my bf, that belly is great for comfort when hugging him and to feel his added weight when he crushes my skinny ass while pinning me to the bed is just orgasmic."
10,I think it's interesting. All of the people asking why we need a parade and need to feel special and degrading Trans people. It really brings light to the fact that homophobia is still immensely prominent. It reinforces everything people are calling out in their posts. We need pride because of the people that still don't understand it's necessity. Pride just needs to bring the community workshops and more education to the forefront. Unfortunately it isn't profitable so it isn't practical. But it's clear to me that pride is as necessary as ever
11,I've never been sexually harassed at work but almost all of the sexual harassment and sexual assault on a night out has come from straight women.
12,"First of all that‚Äòs a lot of drama both of you have been going trough.
I think if you want to save your friendship you have to get over being that impulsive.
You need some time to figure out your sexuality, your feelings and personal identity.
And he needs some space to think about everything what happened and hopefully realize how important your friendship is either way.

No more screaming, falling down to the ground or running out of situations. Don‚Äòt let this phase ruin your friendship."
13,"I mean it should be allowed. For example, Victoria‚Äôs Secret put a rainbow on their logo despite saying they won‚Äôt hire trans models because that‚Äôs not the image they are going for very recently."
14,It‚Äôs not small. It‚Äôs huge. This is a huge step.
15,"There was an irish guy (from Ireland, not just an American claiming Irish roots) who was hit on, ass slapped, and talked dirty to all the time...

The guy had a wife and new born baby and didn't want any of that shit, real straight up family man... He quit because of it and HR said that men can't be sexually harrassed.

Straight women are just as toxic as anyone else."
16,"I agree with you. It's perfectly fine not to watch RPDR or be a ""scene gay""

I don't think you're homophobic based on your story.

That being said, it is homophobic to think less of gays who do like RPDR, or look and dress femme. There is a high correlation between the gays that boast they hate RPDR and those looking for masc4masc üòÇ
 
Gay elitism happens on both sides unfortunately...."
17,"As  gay dude who loves Eurovision, has been to two Gaga concerts and got hooked on Drag Race last season... fuck these guys. You like what you like. One of our biggest fights is the fight to he allowed to he ourselves. If we don't want to have that denied to us, why are we now denying it to each other?

I may joke about ""revoking your gay card"", but just like that: a joke."
18,Tfw you become aware of pride and want to go to pride but then you find out that pride already happened a month ago where you live bc fk June for some reason...
19,you have a build that is likely desirable to a lot of dudes.
20,"Congrats!

Your mom probably could have handled that a little better (like letting you know he found out and was cool with the whole thing), but I'm glad things worked out for you.

A lot of times, having a gay family member, relative, or friend is all it takes to change ""the gays"" from a foreign thing to a relateable thing in someone's mind, and feelings can change along with it. (It's why I feel like being out and open, where possible, is helpful in the long run.)"
21,We did. He said after he kissed my cheek + was about to go - ‚Äúdo you want my number?‚Äù And I‚Äôm like ‚Äúyeahh sure‚Äù and he gave it to me
22,"I can‚Äôt wait until they go back to their subs and leave us alone. 

Nobody wants them here. They get downvoted into oblivion constantly 

Yet they still come back. 

I think they like being hated."
23,"This gives me hope. I gained some depression weight in the last few months. My bf swears up and down that it doesn't bother him. But I have such a hard time feeling confident in my body right now. 

I still want to lose the weight because exercise helps my mental health and I like the way I look when I'm thinner, but maybe in the meantime, I don't have to feel so crappy about it all."
24,"My ex was brainwashed, both mother and father were pastors of a rightwing extremist cowboy church. He was an anti-vaxxer, believed the Clintons were rapists and pedophiles, supported Trump as a savior, saw Rightwing folks as just misunderstood when they said gay slurs and that gays should be killed, believed women were forced into abortions by liberals, and believed about every rightwing conspiracy video he could find on Youtube. 

Sometimes people are beyond help."
25,Hello. You can send all asian tops my way
26,Do your parents get to control access to your nieces? Talk to your sibling(s). Talk to your aunts and uncles and cousins and grandparents. You‚Äôre a grownup. Your parents don‚Äôt get to decide who you can continue to have a relationship with in your family.
27,So did you at least exchange numbers??
28,"I‚Äôm full Asian, 5‚Äô3‚Äù, and a top. I feel your pain so much. Guys always assume I‚Äôm a bottom. I‚Äôm not, Ive done it a few times and didn‚Äôt enjoy it. But, that‚Äôs what most guys always expect of me to do."
29,Walk away.
30,A little louder for the bottoms in the back please! üó£ haha we gays tend to judge books by their covers.
31,"Speaking as a bisexual guy myself, I experienced this in my own dating life, and it was hurtful. You should be with someone who respects you for who you are, and there are plenty of women who will. I'm sorry that she wasn't able to be that person, but please don't hide yourself away. There's no shame in being you."
32,"When I was 8 years old I went to a summer day camp where I was assigned a camp counselor named Chris. In retrospect Chris was probably just a very average college kid and in fact was perhaps a little dumb, but I WORSHIPED him. He had everything that made a person cool in the early 90s, which if I recall correctly was actually only two things, spiked hair and a puka shell necklace. It was a simpler time.

Anywho, long story short, Chris gave me a piggy back ride in the shallow end of a swimming pool. I'm talking skin on skin contact, my face resting on his sun-tanned shoulders. Let me tell you, the warmth that filled my body in that moment, that unbridled joy, it opened my fucking chakras. For one brief eternity I was in an avatar state of superimposed homosexuals through the ages, I was Wilde, I was Alexander, I was Ai and Whitman. I was every nameless, faceless individual who had ever succumbed to that love which dare not speak its name. It's the gayest I've ever been and can ever hope to be, my adult homosexual life is, but the final ember of the homosexual inferno which first awakened me into the gay mind stream.

On god, if I ever run into that man, even if he's old and fat I will do unspeakable things to and for him."
33,Me.. sometimes i feel like a failure
34,"OP has no perspective.

They say that no big company would dare to market to lgbt people 15 years ago. 

15 years ago was 2004. 

Subaru has been [actively courting lgbt customers since the 90s](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/06/how-subarus-came-to-be-seen-as-cars-for-lesbians/488042/)."
35,So she is OK sucking a dick but if a man does it somehow it is disgusting?    So is she disgusting?
36,Seriously. Google was a great help to this year's Pride in Seoul.
37,"&gt;What should we say to him?

Well, it's pride month so it's a decent talking point to just bring up as something you and your husband are supportive of.  And let your son directly know that if he or any of his friends happened to be bi or gay or whatever that you'll love them regardless and are welcome in your home at any time.  

I don't think you need to ask questions at this time, but a simple broadcast will give him some reassurance."
38,"Could be Opposite Florence Nightingale Syndrome.

Make sure your feelings are legit otherwise it could be devastating for him and the friendship."
39,Run
40,"This means so much to me. As someone who was born in this beautiful country this honestly feels amazing. 

This gives me hope.

Hope that I can finally tell the boy who's been in the closet for the last 6 years I love him.

Hope that one day, I will be able to get married in the most beautiful country in this world: my home. 

Hope that one day I will be able to give my children a life as half as blessed as mine. 

I hope everyone has hope today too. Because it's out there. 

Here's to a future filled with hope x"
41,"IMHO, gay trump supporters are either mentally ill or are white supremacist who identify with whiteness more than they do homosexuality."
42,"It confirms their victim complex that they use to justify being dishonest, manipulative dicks to others. We ""started it"" by being ""mean"" and ""intolerant"" and trying to ""silence"" them. They think that balls-to-the-wall toxic vitriol and obnoxious trolling is just giving us the taste of our own medicine."
43,And YouTube often demonetizes lgbtq content
44,"LPT: Anytime a guy starts a conversation with you and/or touches you, that generally means he's interested."
45,"I'd still be careful.  He is literally nursing you back to health.  He's been there for you when no one else would be.  That's hard to not fall in love with.  However, i would get completely well and take a step back from the situation so you can see things clearly.  Once the knight in shining armor takes his armor off are you still going to be in love with the man that he is?  Or are you just so grateful for him taking care of you that you're clinging to him like he's the last boat off the Titanic.  I'm not trying to be cruel at all.  I'm just saying you need to be 2000% sure before you even suggest something like this.  Knowing he had a crush on you then giving him false hope is crueler than anything i can say here.  I think you're too far in the weeds to see your situation clearly.

This is the very reason that doctors are not allowed to take patients.  Patients put the doctors on a pedestal since they saved the patients life.  It can turn into a power difference and people get hurt. (Yeah i get your friend probably isn't a doctor but he's your caretaker so its pretty close)"
46,Death by snu snu?
47,Yup. But I have accepted my reality and am now working to become a hot sugar daddy when I enter my 40s.
48,Thank you! I'm pleasantly surprised by an Eid wish in this sub. Made my night. I just arrived in my hometown to be with family.
49,"dude...my fianc√© has been on military deployment for a long time. I've been living in a city I don't really know many people for a few years now. I work - go home - go to the gym - hang with my dog - do some adulting. Netflix and chill party of one. lol. 

anyhow. I had a colleague / supervisor ask me all these questions....do I know X restaurant....tried X wine...know about X event...so I said no. he goes....so what DO you even do?   


I was so blown away and both insulted and wanting to say go fuck yourself you jerk off (but didn't bc I want to keep my job ;) but also embarrassed and kept thinking...am I a boring loser? 

&amp;#x200B;

in the end...no. that's just who I am. I'm low key low maintenance, not pretentious...and enjoy my virtual dates with my fella. this jackoff colleague's life sounds exhausting and as if he's constantly trying to prove something. F him and anyone who judges you.

&amp;#x200B;

that doesn't make us boring. it makes us comfortable with who we are."
50,"Be confident in yourself. Validation from other people only last so long, but self love builds a strong foundation for secure people."
51,"If someone hits on you, don't say ""I'M STRAIGHT!"", just decline - you're sexuality isn't relevant. Also if someone is nice to you, don't immediately assume they are hitting on you just because you're in a gay bar. 

Otherwise have fun!"
52,"That's a RIP from me fam, hope you have fun if you go though!"
53,Bahahahahahahahaha
54,"They'll earn money, we'll have more visibility and, hopefully, more acceptance (and their pride themed products), it may be a win-win situation."
55,"Here's the thing: corporations don't lead public opinion, they follow it. They show up *after* all the hard work has been done, which means their ""support"" is worthless."
56,...can you eat beef if the cow ate whole grains?
57,You should really report this and call them out on their sexual harassment
58,"Um excuse me that's gay for ""did you fuck"""
59,"tell him exactly what you said in the third-to-last paragraph, the one before all your questions.

i‚Äôve been in a similar situation, where the person i fancied was my best friend - i didn‚Äôt want to lose him, but i also couldn‚Äôt get over my feelings for him, which i (like your mate) had had for almost the entirety of our friendship... all in all, we worked it out and have been together for almost 6 years now. he‚Äôs bisexual, i‚Äôm gay.

but yeah, we did a lot of kissing-without-talking before figuring things out."
60,"My life has waves of activity. I have like three weeks where people are in town, everyone is calling me to do things, it‚Äôs kind of hectic honestly. Then three weeks where I feel like I have nothing going on at all. It‚Äôs really strange."
61,Ignore her...Be with people who accept you. Be yourself.
62,He must have been hot as fuck to put up with more than a minute of that.
63,Just remember that the official GOP stance on marriage is that it's between a man and a woman. FUCK THE GOP
64,"""thank you for telling me"" seems like a nice, supportive, neutral thing to say to me. I would certainly be fine with that!"
65,It's abusive and toxic. Get out because you deserve better.
66,Not transphobic
67,"The thing is, pride month is an excellent opportunity for homophobics to start yelling, and its also an excellent opportunity for the LGBT to start yelling back. It's not that the internet gets homophobic, it just gets louder."
68,Cheers. I‚Äôm only really asking because I downloaded grindr for the first time last night and all I saw was dudes with abs. I‚Äôm usually confident but it made me feel a little insecure
69,"He hid 90% of it from me at first, and slowly opened up more and more about it. Eventually I had to get away because it was becoming a herculean challenge to try to talk sense into him."
70,Well just because your gay doesn't mean your not homophobic.
71,Why is this 18yo having sex with a fourteen year old?
72,"I never would have thought about this perspective, but thank you for bringing it to me. I'll be a bit less pessimistic with rainbow capitalism from now on."
73,Cishet Becky's should not be the ones calling out gay men as homophobic though.
74,She didn‚Äôt deserve you!
75,Absolutely he looked remarkably like Wolverine
76,"Mostly I've seen are people complaining about companies that pretend to carter to LGBT but don't do it really. Like Google and Youtube that makes their logo a rainbow but continue do demonetize LGBT content and give special platform to homophobic content.

Regular shops selling LGBT things are a non thing to me. Never saw it spread here on BH as much as it seems prevalent on US major cities during pride month."
77,"Honestly not surprising, the fetishisation of lesbians and bisexual women is still super prevalent among straight men, it's seen as entertainment because for many men it is entertainment, it's among the top most watched porn genres by straight men, I knew a guy that said he only watched lesbian porn because he didn't want to see a dick while jacking off. 

This also results in some men internalising the weird ass idea that lesbians are one great dick away from turning straight, because they don't see homosexuality as anything but a kink or a fetish that can infect you (when they are afraid of a gay guy turning them gay) or to be removed (when they ""turn"" lesbians straight)

As a small sidenote, it feel unnecessary to point out this, but Lesbians and Bisexual women are rarely spoken in gay discussions, but it's important to remember that they have to deal with the same bullshit we do as sexual minorities or even worse for being sexual minority women that is seen as a commodity by many. For some reason it seems there's a pretty big rift between the two groups in casual conversations, even though personally I always had lesbian friends so it's super weird to me."
78,I am doing something about some things I want to accomplish.  A couple of major things I'm not really acting on.  You've gotta take things one step at a time.
79,"Subaru ran those ads incognito though. They used signalling, such as license plates on the car in the ad, to signal to lesbian and gay populations that they should buy this car. It's the same as saying ""they're family"" or ""I'm a friend of Dorothy"". It's mostly only understood by the in-crowd. It's a world of difference to have large corporations putting rainbows and actual same sex couples in ads specific to Pride month."
80,"I‚Äôm an Asian guy who prefers to top, or flip flop occasionally. Too bad only folks interested in me are sixty year old white daddies who expect me to bottom lol."
81,"**Sure, but there are rules:**

**1. Stay hydrated**

**2. Wear comfortable shoes**

*""3. There is no whining at pride**

**4. Use plenty of sunscreen**

**5. Have fun!**"
82,"Damn, you didnt have to spill the truth THAT hard

Well actually, it is good that you did. Some people will swear up and down that there are ""no tops"" but when a top hits them up, they reject them unless they tick every single one of their boxes"
83,It was a little awkward...all that quacking.
84,"Dude, trust us. Walk away. He's one of the worst guys."
85,Yes
86,"So, I can say that sexual harassment in the workplace, from my experience, is a lot harder to pin down for LGBT people. The comments we get aren't always *intended* to be serious, but that's only because being LGBT is still largely treated by men and women as some kind of personality trait, like being a fan of Games of Thrones or having a thing for baked pastries. That's why the majority of our experiences in the workplace aren't *outright* inappropriate advances, but more often comments people‚Äîespecially women‚Äîmake around us that to *them* sound like they're ""meshing"" with us, but in reality are them being ignorant and stereotyping.

If the survey actually measured *harassment* then I highly doubt even one respondent would say, ""No, I've never dealt with that."" Because *harassment* is the thing we have to dodge because company policies will refer to ""sexual preferences"" instead of ""sexual orientations"", or give women the impression that *gay male* colleagues are as likely as *straight male* colleagues to sexually harass them (which is proven bullshit) by oversimplifying these issues as gender-specific only issues.

My male boss might suggest that I'd be ""distracting"" for a client, but my female boss is the one who thinks it's appropriate to do a ""YAAASSSSSS QUEEEN"" as I'm just trying to get to my desk. My male boss might exclude me from ""family""-oriented events, but my female boss will most likely introduce me to her family as the ""gay guy she works with.""

In general, I'm not surprised at all. I can't speak for the experiences of lesbians, but I can certainly say from my experience as a gay man that workplace harassment is definitely not a *male-*only issue."
87,"My brother would probably be ok with it but my aunts/uncles definitely wouldn't. It'd just be odd for me to spend time with my brother's family without my parents, I feel like I'd always be thinking of how good it could've been."
88,"Reminds me of when an article was posted on Instagram saying that someone that was in a meme was gay. So I commented ""hah I knew it"" cause my gaydar went off. Some girl then writes a whole essay about how homophobic I am, and how I'll never understand the struggles of a gay man. She blocked me after I just replied that I am gay."
89,"That cum be free range, organic, vegan, and allergen free. Slurp it up henny"
90,"I worked in an office that was 75% straight women with my boss and my bosses boss being women. I felt constant unwanted physical contact from them that I just didn‚Äôt want to deal with and I found hypocritical because they were uber feminist ‚Äúwomen aren‚Äôt allowed to succeed in the workplace‚Äù types (despite them being in high levels of power at my institution and the % of workers being vast majority female). It didn‚Äôt make me incapable of working and I could deal with it, but it was annoying and uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt think things like that should escalate to a Human Resources level, but I just found it hypocritical because I know if roles were reversed, they‚Äôd report it in a heartbeat."
91,"Amateur, I *constantly* *know* I'm a failure"
92,"&gt;corporate allies

nyet comrad"
93,"But disagreeing with certain public aspects of Pride don't make you homophobic. Because you can hate certain things about pride, and or gay culture and it not be about homophobia."
94,"‚ÄúI know I‚Äôll get downvoted by the intolerant left but trans people are disgusting‚Äù

They always post things like this. You downvote them because of the filth they say and they just use the downvoted as confirmation of ‚Äúthe intolerant left‚Äù rather than their hateful statements."
95,Yess so wholesome :)
96,"My best friend years ago used to constantly say homophobic things to me all the time and clearly didnt like gay people. I remember I came out to him while we we playing Diablo 3. I told him I was gay and he looked over at me and said that's cool but we have to kill this boss.

After that moment I never heard a homophobic word from him and he immediately decided we should and the local gay bar to our list of places to frequent. His whole behavior did a complete 180 in an instant. 

Sometimes people are homophobic because that's what they were taught and they have no one in their personal lives they care about that it affects and all ot takes is them having one gay person in their lives to realize their views are retarded and abandon them."
97,"imo its weird if theres not a single LGBT person in your group, but thats just me"
98,"I was chatting with a good friend of mine (who is straight) about this very topic.  He feels that the LGBTQ community doesn‚Äôt have it that bad and that the whole gay thing is being shoved down his throat.

After discussing it further, it turns out he really doesn‚Äôt understand that homophobia is still a thing and that we still struggle on a daily basis.  We discussed many of my experiences and my perspective and I think he‚Äôs starting to get it.

It is really hard for straight men to relate to how we have to hide who we are.  They just don‚Äôt have the experience nor the perspective.  We just have to be patient and help them understand."
99,"Yeah, my family disowned and tried to kill me when I got outed. Be careful if your family is extremely religious."
100,"Anti-trans rhetoric needs to go. Debating over the in and out group of being queer is one thing, arguing that a large portion of these people are mentally ill and need to be treated like children is beyond the pale.  
  
This place stops being a resource for young Queer youth when we cross that line."
101,"When it's just my sister and me, we're great. Whe it's just my mom and me, we're great. When it's all three of us, or even just those two, there's gonna be a fight.

I don't think it's odd to see one family member without others. I go out of my way to do it."
102,"I'm basically the opposite of y'all. Larger dude, a bit scruffy. The assumption I'm a top is common and, frankly, frustrating. I'm a bottom, and I surprisingly tend to like guys who would get assumed to be bottoms. But be it where I live or just not looking in the right circles, anybody who learns I'm a bottom just kinda gives me a funny look and walks away."
103,"I have no problem with his sexuality. The only issue I have is that they both have girlfriends. Other than that I'm we're very accepting of the situation. In matter of fact we embrace it. 

As for school policies, if there's any sort of discrimination being done towards either of them, I would bring hell fire down"
104,"‚ÄúCool‚Äù is perfectly acceptable. It means I get it and it‚Äôs not an issue. ‚ÄúThanks for telling me‚Äù  as someone else said, ‚Äúcool‚Äù ‚Äúright on‚Äù. All are good delivered when delivered with a smile. We just want to know you‚Äôre not gonna punch us on the face of it comes out accidentally or without our knowledge. 

It says a lot about you to want to be understanding. That‚Äôs sort of all we are looking for."
105,"the main organizer is a neo-nazi, so this is going to be hilarious."
106,"Honestly... I feel the same a lot of the time.  But I think it has more to do with interacting with people you actually feel some kind of connection with.  A lot of times... I feel boring around other people... but here's the thing: most other people BORE ME.  I find most people boring as fuck regardless of whatever crazy adventurous lives they live.  I can be at home starring at the wall... and find something interesting in that lol.  It's just a matter of finding someone who ""gets"" you.  Most of the time I find hanging out with other people pretty boring... unless that is... I'm with the few friends I have who I actually enjoy talking with.  You're probably the same."
107,"Hahahahaha a month ago, for me it was gaypril"
108,Yeah I definitely acted really childish in the moment. I was just at a loss for what to do. Thanks for the advice friend.
109,Sorry if its a serious concern it just sounds hilarious at a glance
110,"I was around when it was unheard of to see rainbows everywhere and it still bothers me. While I appreciate the overall support, it's important to still be able to hold companies accountable. There's a difference between simply profiting off our community as is the way of businesses and profiting off the community while also hurting it. YouTube is the easiest example. They're always big on putting rainbows on the logo, but do little to help promote their LGBT content creators and do just as little to enforce their TOS in regards to hateful, often homophobic, language, as is currently being openly shown in regards to the Steven Crowder/Carlos Maza situation. It'd be like if Chick-Fil-A created a rainbow version of it's logo for Pride month. We know it wouldn't be genuine support considering where they donate money. You can be happy for the overall progress and still critical of the individual companies participating in the ""inclusivity."" Furthermore, a lot of what I've seen is typically people asking if any percentage of the money will go to help LGBT people by being donated to an LGBT charity or if it is simply a company using our marginalized community to line their pockets with zero thought behind it. To just brush past valid concerns and basically say 'just look at the pretty rainbows and be thankful' is naive and shows a lack of understanding in where the complaints are coming from.
The concern is similar to that of companies and products during Breast Cancer Awareness month - slapping pink or rainbows on something to show support means nothing if there's no real action behind it whatsoever."
111,Literally me üò≠
112,He wasn't made out of money.
113,there‚Äôs just more to love ü§©
114,"I haven't been through this but I have an FWB that has and we have talked about it on occasion.

This is rough and it's easy for people to become hateful and attack your family or their beliefs. But, the bottom line is you love them and in a odd way they love you too. They think they're helping, in most cases.

My advice is not to lie to them to maintain relationships (not that you would). You have to be honest about who you are.

Try to take the high road, even if they say or do hurtful things. When people start aging and dying (not trying to be morbid or dramatic) remorse can set in. If you've stayed on the high road then you won't have as many regrets.

Live your life and be the best person you can be. You can't fix their issues for them. All you can do is be patient, love them from afar, and hope they eventually come around in time.

This isn't fair but that's life, all too often.

If you allow this to change you, become bitter or vindictive, then you lose twice. You lose your family connection and you lose a piece of yourself. You have to be the bigger person here and take the high road for your own peace of mind.

I'm sorry and good luck."
115,"As someone who was on the opposite end of this, don‚Äôt do it!

A guy said the same thing. Then snapped out of it and realized he was wrong.

118,"I mean how homophobic are we talking? I meet people all the time who use homophobic language, call things gay, call people fags, etc Then there are people like my family who would call gay people ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù or ‚Äúabominations‚Äù and say they were going to hell. 

Sometimes people are insensitive that doesn‚Äôt mean they are at their core homophobic.

Its pride month after all, show your stance on LGBT issues. The issue that is a bit troubling is their girlfriends.

138,"People get the concept of ""pride"" twisted often. LGBT pride is not about feeling great about yourself like you have accomplished something tangible by being born LGBT. Anti-LGBT people often ask ""Why do you need pride? You didn't do anything to be LGBT"".

Gay pride is more accurately depicted as a sense of contentment with being LGBT and being confident in being open about being LGBT in a society that is still filled with many who would despise you for it. 

Gay pride is not about celebrating our individual accomplishments necessarily, but it is about making ourselves heard and to show bigots that we aren't going away anytime soon, so might as well get over yourselves and accept that we're here to stay.

There is no straight pride because straight people haven't organized any more or less. Ask your straight friends why they don't start creating straight pride parades themselves rather than feeling entitled for others to do it for them. But there's also not much of a push for straight pride because straight people never experience any cultural or societal oppression/pressure to stop being straight, or to stop talking about being straight, or to stop doing straight things or to stop making straight characters in media.

As for equal rights, in many places in the US at least gay/bi people are pretty close to equal under the law. There are still inadequacies  in protections for jobs and things like housing though. Trans people still have a huge struggle, especially with the Trump administration revoking so many of their protections and advancements."
139,"You know no one here going to have that answer for you. It's 100% of up to both of you to make this work, communication and committing to seeing each other is extremely important, also don't be afraid of just randomly swinging by to just see him I promise he'll really love that especially after a tough day."

150,"Gay Republicans have every right to be on this sub, but that doesn't mean I can't lambast their idiotic asses for supporting a group that is hostile towards the LGBTQ+ community. It doesn't help so many gay conservatives tend to be trans phobic. That shit ain't welcome."
151,"Gotta admit, the title had me worried, but this is a really good post that I really needed to see right now."
152,"You could be somewhat curious/bisexual/gay. 

However, I would be really careful with this. You've already said how you have no family around, and this guy is your home and everything. Using him for a bit of experimentation could wreck this friendship, and that is even if he feels the same way.

Spend some time thinking about your feelings, and slowly talk to him about it. Don't go for big gestures or trying to do everything at once. 

There is a real chance that the emotions you are feeling are down to loneliness/thanks of his care for you, and if you did get naked with him you could find it to be a huge mistake."
153,"It‚Äôs things like that that change minds. Gay rights are won on a case-by-case basis. The unsung heroes are the ones who came out facing adversity. It‚Äôs easy to ‚Äúhate the gays‚Äù when you don‚Äôt know any. When ‚Äúthe gay‚Äù is a son, daughter, niece, nephew, etc. , it forces good people to reassess their beliefs. Not all will. But a lot will. And that‚Äôs progress."

159,"""what do they actually expect ppl to text them?""

They expect you to do all the conversational work. Since they're incapable of handling basic greetings or steering a conversation in certain ways or just ignoring other bad chatters, they whine about it in their profiles and hope you put in the work while doing none themselves.

173,"&gt; gay trump supporters are either mentally ill or are white supremacist

Porque no los dos?"
174,Whilst I agree some corporations celebrating pride is fine not all companies are the same. There are banks who give loans and do business with countries who sentence gay people to prison or give them the death penalty who ‚Äúcelebrate pride‚Äù and Military industry who come to pride parades yet provide military equipment to regimes that commit crimes against humanity. The LGBT+ community has always stood for human rights why should we let people who destroy liberties around the world into our parades just so we can get some exposure?
175,"I honestly was unsure what RPDR stood for, until I saw your post, and clued in it is Drag Race.  I have seen all of four episodes, and enjoyed them but do not watch faithfully at all.  The amount of gay guys I have met who literally get offended by that makes me feel annoyed.  I am 'masc' for lack of a better way to describe myself, but I am not looking for masc, I typically like feminine guys, but the hostility I get when people find out I am gay and prefer NFL and NHL to RPDR makes me feel like I am somehow a shitty gay.  We all have it hard enough being in the minority of society, why do we have to make it harder on each other acting like that?"
176,"I'm one of those 30+ community members, and I absolutely believe we need to step back and take pause with this ""rainbow capitalism"". I understand your point, but at the same time, it's still  horseshit. There is still no federal law (talking US now) that protects LGBTQ employees from workplace discrimination. You better believe it's still the good ole' boy's club where there is still a uniform standard--which many already know what that standard exactly is. I work in an industry where sexuality can still be viewed as an issue. We have a president and vice president who aren't exactly warm towards us. Obergefell v. Hodges is only 4 years old, and only *allowed* gay marriage through judicial fiat, not some all  encompassing legislative process. And it's not exactly that secure.

I grew up in a time where, while acceptance was slowly creeping forward, it was still absolute shit to be out and proud. As you said, it was career suicide. These businesses where nowhere to be seen helping to advance a cause other than making money. Now it's different, great, but you speak about those times as if they were decades ago. It's only as recent as 10 years ago we still had many of those issues. 

They've now jumped on the bandwagon. The purpose is clear: it's to take advantage of current trends and make money. That's all they give a shit about. We're now a fucking commodity. Rainbow symbols were symbols of pride and even rebellion. Now it's a fucking Nike swoosh and Xbox icons and on symbols with the only intended purpose to ""buy! buy! buy!"". 

Lest we forget, pride was in large part started to commemorate the Stonewall riots. Pride was an act of rebellion, rage, and fighting back against discrimination which included physical assault and even death for gays. We're not whores to be pimped out for the sake of corporations and capitalist assholes who would just as soon throw us into a fire pit if it would make a buck."
177,I had no idea that was such an intense question for some people.

Side note there are a lot of gay guys with a straight guy fetish, on the flip side there are a ton of ""straight"" guys with a gay fetish too so it can go many ways."
180,Except when they‚Äôre talking to me. They usually want me to go away.
181,"I don't get this mentality. Should they be against LGBT, then? What's the problem of supporting LGBT for money? They are supporting it, right?"
182,"as a young gay who goes to a Christian school, I just wanted to add this. a lot of the girls in my grade view me as this mythical, hilarious, scandalous person who's super fun and silly to hang out with because I'm gay. they see themselves as these kind of rule breaking ""outsiders"" who like to hang out with the flamboyant gay kid. but at the same time, none of those girls treat my lesbian friends with any kind of respect. the straight girls view them as gross deviants and the straight boys view them as these *super hot whores who could be getting SO MUCH of thier dick if they only tried*. lesbians aren't treated right, and it makes me really sad."
183,"As a gay bro I have received it from strait women in my office who already know I'm gay.  
Unwanted touching has happened and also being asked if they can turn me strait or if I would pretend to be their bf for one reason or another.  Not enjoyable if the roles were reversed I would be fired or worse."

187,It‚Äôs kind of hard for me to get tops only because I usually get rejected for my height I‚Äôm 6‚Äô6 and most times they want someone shorter in my case especially if the guy is really short so I kind of get the wrong side of the stick for that but otherwise bravo.

We have all kinds of voices on here. We don't gatekeep. This is why most of the other LGBT subreddits hate us.

As a progressive I could careless about their posts. I'm just here to answer questions and help where I can."
192,And you know what? That's completely okay!
193,They are racing stripes to acknowledge your competitive nature.
194,Bel Ami guys are gorgeous. The sex always looks so phony and dramatized though.
195,"I think its something, and I appreciate it. They could not do anything at all, and they definitely face backlash for even the Pride stuff. I think its a good step in the direct of universal normalization of LGBT identities, since conservatives and homophobes will have a harder time every year to find businesses that at least outwardly celebrate Pride."
196,Lots of love to you :)
197,"Honestly I think you should tell him all of what you posted here. Be super honest and frank that you don‚Äôt know what exactly you‚Äôre feeling and that it‚Äôs scary as shit for you too. Admit you‚Äôve started watching gay porn too, honestly this might convince him a bit. 

And then remind him that his friendship means more to you than anything, and that that will never change. You should ask him what boundaries he would want to set if you want to continue being friends (maybe no more making out?) Or maybe tell him you want to take him out on a date. 

On a personal note, you should think about your identity too. You may be bisexual or pansexual. Or you may be straight with an exception. At the end of the day, we are all just humans looking for companionship, and sexuality is a messy messy messy thing."
198,"I think it's a combination of two factors: 

- Caring more about other kinds of policies 
- Assuming that the throwback in LGBT rights won't affect them. 

You can see that with people like Guy Benson. Celebrating getting engaged on Instagram without thinking that if it depended on people like him, he wouldn't be able to get married. 

I'm going to go for the mos charitative assumption and say that they probably care more about lots of other issues than about LGBT rights and think that the positive of getting other issues solved outweight any potential restriction on civil rights. 

I mean, I can understand the mindset. If we had a candidate that combined a solid position against climate change with wanting to ban gay marriage, and one that wanted to do nothing on climate change and was all for gay rights, my vote would probably go for the first. 

Where my understanding fails is in thinking what kind of positions do conservatives propose that are a good tradeoff for these guys."
199,"Honestly, from a gay guy to a guy who‚Äôs questioning. You both need to sit down and talk, not make out. Sure, diving into your feelings seems right now. But in a few weeks you might think differently. You‚Äôre watching Gay porn, which is ok. But Porn Rewires the mind. Not in the sense it makes you gay, but that it muddies the mind. I think you should distance yourself from porn until you can think clearly. Sit down with your friend, tell him your doubts. Ask him about it, and really consider how you feel. It‚Äôs a lot of emotional pressure you‚Äôre putting yourself under. Statistics show that the ratio of homosexual/bisexual people are greater than we previously thought. It‚Äôs ok to be Bisexual. But still, the biggest thing is communication. Slow down, and figure things out with each other. That last guy that commented is right. No more emotional explosions in response to him leaving. Explore your sexuality. Find your comfort zone."
200,"Keep a written record of date, time, place and content of comments."
201,"I'm Canadian and I live in China. I wouldn't exactly say that the LGBT community is persecuted here but it's definitely a fact that activism, etc. is not super possible, and generally speaking the government's attitude towards LGBT communities is somewhere between indifference and fear (of AIDS, and subverting the ""traditional"" values of the family, etc.). 

China is consumerist enough now that those big companies, especially the massively popular ones like Nike, Adidas and Starbucks, do have their Pride Month stuff available here, which I think is really cool because Pride Month is not a thing at all here, and the Pride Parade is impossible (not necessarily because of repression but more because parades of any kind in China just do not happen), so it is cool to see big companies bring these things in the mainstream. In fact I think it's a really good strategy for a country like China because people here really like to buy Western brands, and generally kind of look up to the West a bit in terms of knowing what's cool and trendy, and no company in China would really ever do this kind of stuff for fear of making waves, but these huge companies can do it, so I think it's great."

205,"Hey bro,

Taking a suicide ideation to a conscious active attempt is a very serious thing, as you surely know at the moment. Everything else I am going to say is as much for me as for you or someone else:

As part of your effort I would suggest a rather global shift in perspective. Suicidal impulses are about mitigation, avoidance, and desperation. They attempt to manage the unmanageable. Pain and fear join anxiety and together achieve an exponential occlusion which then hides other very large portions of reality. 

In order to refocus, gain perspective and manage anxiety, fear, and emotional pain, several things can be employed. Self esteem building by doing ‚Äúesteem-able things‚Äù and daily affirmations provide some focus other than pain/anxiety. Activity like walking, jogging or running provides a relief valve for dealing with the overwhelming pain and fear by siphoning it off. Activity is stress reduction and movement is very good for recenter and introduce a way to remove some of the load. 

Do not introduce depressants, (alcohol and others) because they work and right now depressants have narrowed the field ahead. Introduce herbs and uplifting things - spend time in nature, reflect on your self worth."
206,"I disagree. Most people don't like American corporations. In latin America american companies are known mostly for stripping the land of resources and paying people very poorly.

When a bunch of rich foreigners come to your country and take all the resources, then tell you that gay people are actually good, it doesn't work. Because why would anyone trust them? Most people globally resent the power and influence of corporate America, so when they hear corporate ""allies"" advocate for our rights it pushes them in the opposite direction. People often think of the local gay community as a symptom of foreign influence/decadence, and that is bad for gay people."
207,"I would say the inability to cook makes a guy less attractive, which technically makes you right. I think knowing how to prepare food is a basic adult function though."

212,"we were both terrified at the idea of losing our friendship - but also acknowledged that if we didn‚Äôt work out in said relationship, we would absolutely still be constant figures in the other‚Äôs life.

we discussed how it might affect others, namely our other best friends in the ‚Äúgroup‚Äù that we are a part of. we also discussed what we were looking for in a relationship, our boundaries and how fast/slow we would be comfortable taking it, how exactly we‚Äôd adapt to our situation to a more intimate one, etc... jump-starting these conversations was the difficult part, but we never did anything more than kissing until after.

215,"I gotchu man! 

1. Ik it seems like you should just bounce up and down, but for the best feeling, it's actually better to just scoot forwards and back, rathed than doing squats on his dick. It'll save you stamina, and it'll feel better for him. 

2. Use those hips homie! Use your hips to rlly work it and swivle around dat dick. Feels friggin amazing and it's very aesthetic to watch a guy do.

3. Wait a bit to cum! Just focus on riding and get as much pleasure out of it as possible. Ik if I ride a guy's dick while jerking off, i'd cum in like 10 seconds, and riding a guys cock is alot harder after you've already came, so I usually wait to touch my dick for when it looks like he's getting close (cumming in unison is a beautiful and life changing thing) 

4. Don't worry about numbers 1-3. Enjoy yourself!! I'm sure he already friggin loves it. The more you worry, the more he'd wonder what he's doing wrong."
216,"I was in my late teens on a beach with some friends. 

One of my friend introduced her cousin, he's cute, lean dude with hairy chest and stomach, and I can literally feel my eyes tracing him from his chest to his crotch, specially the line under his armpit to his hip just like how I look at girls. When I realized that I've been staring at him I just exclaimed ""Holy Shit!"" aloud and walked away."

227,Do not let your parents run your life. If they cut your access to your nieces it will be tough and you'll miss them but it won't be nearly as tough and damaging as getting a gf even a fake one. You'll never be happy and you'll grow to resent your parents and perhaps even your nieces for what your life has become. The best way is to cut your toxic parents off but be open in case they grow and let go of their hateful ways and want to repair their relationship with you.

Say how grateful you are that your parents love and accept you unconditionally, and that you hope the rest of the family can open their hearts like your wonderful parents have. 

There is no win scenario for your parents at that point. They either have to tell the extended family that they're actually shitty and are cutting off communication with you, or they have to go along with it to avoid further embarrassment. Your parents will hate you, but they're the ones that decided to make it an issue by being shitty human beings, so is it really that big of a loss?"
238,"I'm an introvert... I once dated a guy with a very similar personality, and we never went out, just stayed at home ordering takeout and watching tv. even *I* got bored of that.

245,"The Stonewall Riots were started by Sylvia Rivera, a transwoman, and Marsha P. Johnson, a gender non-comfortist. Dropping the T from LGBT on the one hand and quoting those Riots as the important historical and cultural event they are is a pretty bullshit move."
246,"I‚Äôm in a similar situation dude. I was 100% I was straight 2 months ago. I can relate to that feeling of ‚Äùhave I been in love with my best friend without knowing it myself‚Äù? I still have no interest in guys, so I‚Äôm not gay and I wouldn‚Äôt view myself as bisexual either. I feel like if your love is strong enough for someone it can surpass your sexuality."
247,"For real. Some sexual harassment could be considered common, though still awful, and just fixed through normal asking them not to do it. That particular story required a very loud ""What the fuck is wrong with you, Brenda?"" followed by an email to HR."

250,You don‚Äôt need to be made out of money to sue a person/company for sexual assault. Only correcting you because that type of misconception could cause another person to avoid attempting that course of action.

252,"Shout out to Lebanese grandmothers! Mine surprised me as well. 

‚ÄúYa Habibi, love is love‚Äù"
253,I love your optimism lol
254,"No. It is not transphobic to not want to fuck someone with a vagina. In the same way that a straight guy not wanting to fuck a man doesn't make him a homophobe, you not wanting to fuck a trans man doesn't mean you hate trans people. Your ""friend"" is an immature jerk who would absolutely be called an incel if he were cis.

Remember when the trans community said someone not being attracted to a trans person didnt inherently mean they were transphobic and no-one - including them - was owed sex? That was nice."
255,"If the embassy wants to do it, what's the point of denying them?"
256,"My friend always tells me how people think lesbians are more accepted because in a patriarchal society in which straight men decide what is acceptable and what isn't lesbian acts are viewed as merely entertainment for straight men.

Alot of gay men are ignorant to the homophobia and suffering lesbians often go through. Lesbians face weirdly intertwined homophobia and misogyny.

Lesbians in third world countries can not leave the country if they wanted. They can not choose to stay single. They can not even leave the house without permission in case they are married. They can't be free. It's because they are women. 

The sexuality of gay women is constantly invalidated, disrespected and ignored. 

Straight men will invade lesbians spaces and gay dating sites pretending to be women (no I am not talking about lesbian trans women) making it hard for them to date and hookup. 

Lesbians are objectified, ignored and fetishized.

Sure gay men are often the targets of violent threats but that's because our sexuality is acknowledged and therefore seen as a threat by conservatives while they probably only view lesbians as a porn category.

Speaking of porn categories. How come theirs is often times in the straight section of porn hub? Why don't they have their own like gay males do? 

Also I would like to add underage gay girls who get thrown out for being gay are under huge threat of becoming sex slaves, sex workers... etc.

So no lesbians are not ""more accepted"". 

In fact they face way bigger challenges beyond homophobia due to the intersectionality of the gay and the female identity."
257,I know a guy in my area who had a similar experience. He was devastatingly I‚Äôll and a good friend was there taking care of him. Both straight. They‚Äôre married now.
258,One of my exes was a big guy like you and was a bottom and i was way shorter than him. My now bf is really tall and such and we flip fuck sometimes. Its hot fucking a guy way bigger than you imo. Makes me feel powerful lol.
259,"Other guys here have written very insightful things, so I'll try to address something about the consensus that I kinda disagree with.

Despite what you might hear traditionally, having a friendship that's so strong that's skirting the line of a romance is a non-zero sum game. Don't fall for the false dichotomy that forces you to choose between keeping the friendship and exploring your feelings.

My two cents are as such:

* Playing it safe and not going into the romance -which both of you want, you at least somewhat, him desperately and for a *decade*\- in no way guarantees that the friendship will survive. The guy loves you; now that it's out in the open, you can either reciprocate or not, but he can't just icebox his feelings for you again after you've kissed him back a handful of times. There's a considerable chance that if you reject him, he'll leave you to protect his feelings.
* Exploring your feelings for each other doesn't have to kill your friendship. Two points here:
   * If you go into it with open minds and good communication, even if the relationship fails, you can deal with it as adults and remain best friends. I've seen it happen, I've done it, it's definitely feasible. A relationship not working out romantically doesn't have to mean burning every bridge with the person.
   * Forget what you know about straight relationships, that social conditioning doesn't apply here. As a guy, having a boyfriend almost guarantees that he's gonna be your best friend, and not in the married couple, cliche ""my spouse is my confidante and my best friend"" sense. You'll still be best buddies, you can literally just keep doing the same stuff you've always enjoyed together, beers, gaming, sports, music, movies, whatever- you're just in love the guy you have so much in common with, on top of it all. That sort of thing comes much more naturally in same-sex relationships.

Overall, I think that you should be brave and explore your feelings with that guy further; if anything, just to honor all of his years of having your back just because of how much he loves you, without expecting you to love him back. But also because backing out now, in fear of losing your friendship, might just be the thing that destroys it, whereas going forward might not simply save it but perhaps allow it to become more than just friendship."
260,"I'm so sorry, man. She's wrong about all of this. 

Coming out to her took so much courage. I'm sorry she betrayed your trust.

On the bright side, the trash took itself out and you didn't waste any more time with someone incapable of loving you unconditionally."
261,"You were downvoted, but it's probably because you haven'y probably articulate dyourself probably. 

You weren't into it, and that's the bottom line, so good on you for not doing it OP."
262,"I always get bothered when people say it's shoved down their throats.

Like, compared to what? Any given day of the year (even during pride) how many ads do you see featuring gay people, or TV shows or movies about gay people?

How many holidays are literally all about giving straight couples shit or religious holidays. Christmas is advertised like right after Halloween some times."
263,I dont care for big dicks either.  Big dicks fucking hurt. Im quite happy with an average or a small dick.
264,"Well of course not every religious perosn is homophibic. I would just like it if when a religious person does act homophobically, the respective community would actively speak out against the person. Just going ""WeLl we'RE NoT All LiKe ThaT"", helps no one. People know not every religious person is a bigot, but there are enough bigots playing for certain religious teams to the point where it's a problem."
265,He‚Äôs not actually a nice person.

268,Lol unfortunately I am neither
269,"Had to reach back over 100 years for that one, huh?

It's the official stance of the Republican Party of 2019 that confederate statues should remain up and not placed in museums and that Jefferson Davis was a swell guy. Fuck off with your equivocating bullshit."
270,"The silence you gave him instead of communicating is a red flag that this doesn't work.

This isn't your dream but a reality where this guy might not be good for you.

Leave or try to be honest/open with him. He can't read your mind."
271,What were some of the things you guys talked about before you jumped in to the relationship? Hearing from someone who‚Äôs been in a similar circumstance would be really helpful.
272,And how many of these people are using this excuse as they‚Äôve arrived at said date and quickly determined there is no love connection?
273,When I cast my vote I like there to be a hot stinging sensation in my foot as I realize I just shot myself
274,He flat out manipulated you into lowering your self esteem enough so you‚Äôd have sex with him regardless. He doesn‚Äôt deserve the gift of life if he‚Äôs going around treating people like this. You‚Äôre WAY better than this scum.
275,"This exactly!  I hold a fairly unpopular opinion about Pride in my city, where the organizers won't allow LGBTQ Police Officers to march in the parade in uniform.  They have to be plainclothes, but fire fighters, EMTs, and military can call dress in uniform.  This is in reaction to another city in Canada no longer allowing officers to march in uniform so we have followed suit.  I have argued this point and been called homophobic once which has nothing to do with the argument I am making.   Even though as a gay man I feel they should be allowed to march in uniform makes me homophobic because my opinion differs from the majority of the gay people who think they should not be allowed.  That is not at all the case.  People need to think more before they throw that phrase around loosely, especially against their own community."
276,"Well I would be really Frank with him, that some older guy probably only wants him for his body or to take advantage of his misfortune, and that you understand he wants to go somewhere more accepting but that he should do it on his own terms. 

He is a teenager so he will likely ignore everything you say, but also make it clear that he is welcome back if he does Go, and that you will be there for him if you can. It's a tough situation so good luck."

283,"Born in 2001, I‚Äôm 18 now.

In my experience, and this is coming from someone who lives in the south, and goes to an all male Catholic high school, it‚Äôs actually very accepting. 

In my case, I think people kind of just *know* I‚Äôm gay, I give off that vibe I suppose. And I‚Äôve yet to experience any *real* bullying and whatnot. In fact, I‚Äôm one of the more popular figures in my grade, having lots of friends who‚Äôre totally accepting of me.

So considering my location and social climate, I‚Äôd say Gen Z doesn‚Äôt view LGBT as a really taboo subject. To them I‚Äôd say it just is what it is."
284,"It's intentional and completely disingenuous. They aren't hurt or offended or victimized--they just recognize those terms as things liberals care about and try to exploit them in their ""arguments"" against us.

You see it happen all the time. It's like conservative fake outrage using liberal lingo Mad Libs."

288,"Pride month isn't thta big of a deal in Germany though we have our CSD-Parades. They get some hate, mostly old white women and their husband's, but our far right parties and their supporters are still hating extremly on the refugees and Islam."

290,"I think the reason not to attend is fairly obvious in a big city: crowds, heat (if it‚Äôs NYC, LA, or Chicago), can‚Äôt see, etc.

Last year My friends and I were in an apartment along the route so it was clutch: had ac, bathrooms, snacks, drink access, space. Idk if I want to go this year purely because I was so spoiled last year haha"
291,"I‚Äôve been sexually harassed at work. I worked in one of those hard-charging office environments where there were a lot of good looking guys (I wasn‚Äôt one of them). Once they figured out that I was gay, they got a lot of enjoyment out of teasing me about it. The VP on the office was the most enthusiastic about it, teasing me about a particularly attractive man that he hired and whispering directly into my ear (while leaning his entire body over mine) about how frustrating it must be to have to look at this straight guy I couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúhave‚Äù all day. There was no physical threatening, but there was definitely a lot of mocking and, from some of them, hostility. 

I wouldn‚Äôt say it was traumatizing for me. I‚Äôm a big guy, so there wasn‚Äôt any physical intimidation like others face. Once I realized what was going on, I felt free to retaliate by pointing out the various metrosexual habits most of these guys had and how homoerotic a lot of their behavior was (typical frat guys who never grew up). 15 years later, I work in a very different environment where I would never accept not participate in such behavior. I also recognize how someone different could be traumatized by what I experienced. I‚Äôm sure it would have been frightening for someone smaller or less able to defend themselves (both physically and through humorous deflection)."
292,"I don't think you're very far left at all. This post sounds like it was written from the exact center. I'm complaining about rainbow capitalism just like I am critical of capitalism the rest of the time. 

Mainstream LGBTQ acceptance feels nothing short of a miracle, and I am so privileged to be living in a time where I can be understood and accepted by my peers and strangers. However, I also care about the gay men and women that toil away in sweatshops. I care about the LGBTQ members of society who are homeless. I care about LGBTQ immigrants. Blind allegiance to capitalism is abhorrent to me, despite its popularity. I am not satisfied with the gays with money having acceptance and business support. I'll be happy when every LGBTQ American is protected at their work, has guaranteed housing, food, and healthcare, and that we stop exploiting laborers in dangerous conditions in other countries.

I understand why it fills you with optimism. But capitalism is soulless. It looks ethical sometimes, but only when profitable. They only blow with the prevailing winds. Companies didnt create mainstream acceptance, countless activists and protests and an endless series of brave people coming out did."
