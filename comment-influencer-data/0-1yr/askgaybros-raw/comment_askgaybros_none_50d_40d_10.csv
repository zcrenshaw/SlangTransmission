0,"You do realize that not all old men are gross and spend their time creeping on young guys, right? That‚Äôs just a small minority. Older guys do fine, and I‚Äôm not concerned about that."
1,So wait me and y boyfriend can get a boyfriend and a dog Jesus why didn‚Äôt I know this sooner
2,Cry.
3,"as an ""old"" I often find those threads entertaining, because I'm not particularly into young guys, especially younger than 26, but damn if they aren't the ones pursuing me on the apps with considerable persistence. 

so think about that. when you get old, you may end up with more twinks than you know what to do with!"
4,"yet another ""I alone can do it"" strongman.

can't wait to see how he pulls off a better Brexit deal than May negotiated with the EU."
5,Having a huge number of girl friends and having my guy friends call me a ‚Äúplayer‚Äù lmao only if they knew
6,Get bullied
7,"So true. A lot of guys seem to have standards for who they'll date or how they want a date to treat them, yet they don't even met their own standards."
8,It drives me insane because these are like obviously very fit and muscular guys who just ate lunch and aren't currently oiled up and flexing. If they have dadbods then no dad has ever actually had a dad bod.
9,"In a nutshell, you only get out of dating what you put into it. If you're not prepared to make the effort, then prepare to be disappointed!"
10,I don't get it. He has thousands of Instagram pictures where he looks richer than me. Why does he need a gofundme campaign exactly? Pool parties and expensive clothes tell me otherwise.
11,"Me and my husband always reference this video when we see exactly that. 

https://youtu.be/5ay3wex7g3A"
12,"My friend saw him cycling towards him and half heartedly booed him, he got annoyed and said ‚Äúyou could at least put some effort into it‚Äù so my friend booed him louder and he said ‚Äúmuch better‚Äù."
13,"I'm legitimately concerned about the rise of authoritarians. There are too many stupid people in the world who want easy answers to nuanced problems. In the past they just stayed out of complex politics, but strongmen like Johnso  and Trump are appealing to the uneducated who don't know enough to realize how complex the world is, and who distrust intelligence and education.

There's nothing inherently wrong with being anti-establishment. It's the combination of anti-establishment and anti-intellectualism that's so dangerous. It makes people vulnerable to mass manipulation and scapegoating."
14,"This exactly. I'm nearly 40, and I'm well aware that if I start unrelentingly pursuing the 18-25 crowd, then I'll be one of them. But I don't - I enjoy seeing cute younger guys, but I'm not gonna hit on them."
15,I too have gone to the sauna/bathhouse to enjoy the jacuzzi and the steam room etc. It's also a cheap place to take a nap during the day when visiting a city. But if you want action you have to go in the wee hours on a weekend when the clubs are closing and the old men are asleep.
16,Yes! Be the guy you want to date!
17,"It‚Äôs because of your username, ‚ÄúSlutDaddy69.‚Äù"
18,"Getting old doesn‚Äôt mean your have to get fat, nor does it mean you be alone and relying on Grindr for hookups. I‚Äôm older, and neither gay, nor single. Life is great at 54."
19,"Shamefully calling someone at school gay even though I myself was a repressed, closeted guy myself. I can remember I upset him. :("
20,If you are on dating apps come off right now. Install an app called Meetup and go and meet people and make some friends. Love will happen when you least expect it. But you must learn to love yourself before anyone else can love you.
21,"if everybody who complains about Grindr all gave just 5 bucks.... 

your friend would be free 

&amp;#x200B;

best of luck

thanks for posting"
22,"Ever go on a date and the guy keeps going on his phone?

That's the worst. lol"
23,"The guy says he is targeting Netherlands and Germany, you should tell him that if he speaks French France is a good alternative, especially if he immigrates as a student, as Algerians have 'simplified' immigration processes and visa requirements (as a former colony). France isn't perfect but it's totally fine to be gay here."
24,"Right, but if you end up separating the dog gets your TV."
25,"There isn‚Äôt a lot of advice I can personally give. But what I can say is that your friend might‚Äôve been through something similar, talk to him, be open about everything and see what he has to say. If he is open to you experimenting then go further. Just be completely honest with him and see what happens!"
26,"Thisss !!! I am from Tunisia , Algeria's neighbour, and I assure you that someone like this is very likely to have  a non homophobic family , rich parents that can afford more than his whole studies and life abroad, that has relatives abroad he can stay with whenever he wishes, that probably travels abroad three times a year and has fun with guys as much as he can . 

Don't buy into this bullshit , there are a lot of guys like me that have it way worse than him and that are living in poverty , fear and denial . If you want to really help fellow bros in homophobic mislim countries donate to associations  here working to reduce discrimination and provide refuge for people in danger. If you want I can look up links for you ."
27,You're 17.... your hormones have been doused with gasoline and set on fire.  That's why!
28,I guess I‚Äôll have to date men of my own age!! Oooh the indignity!
29,How do you hold your phone gayly?
30,"The secret of Grindr is that it isn't a hookup app, it's a validation engine. At least half of the guys on Grindr would rather get the brief high of feeling sexually attractive enough to hook up, than actually hook up."
31,"Move to Austin. Disgustingly beautiful people, tatted up, running with their disgustingly cute dogs. You‚Äôd never get anything done."
32,"This right here I think is the reason he's so popular. Imagine telling this little anecdote across pubs in Britain. You can picture so many people going ""I don't like the guy but that's funny, he's a good laugh!""

It's that carefully cultivated image of the ""everyman"", who's relatable and a bit of a buffoon. Even then I found myself thinking along similar ish lines, despite the fact that I loathe the man. A broad swathe of the country/party think they could grab a beer with him, and that he's ""real"". Policies be damned. And of course the other swathe of the populace are rich banker twats who here tax cuts and breaks and flock to his banner.

Johnson is insidious."
33,"Scam. 

OP will split proceeds with ""friend"" after GoFundMe account fills up.

Via his Instagram, he's better dressed than I am and seems to be doing just fine hanging at the pool.

This is not somebody who's dealing with a life threatening situation.

Don't fall for this."
34,neither of them are unfit or fat. I've found the whole thing a bit hilarious.
35,Lol he‚Äôs Britain‚Äôs first non white  prime minister (Turkish family)üòÇüòÇüòÇ
36,So you‚Äôre a bottom with a great butt looking for a top with a big dick?
37,"He won't even get to renegotiate another deal. It will be exactly the same as with May, where the PM can't command a majority and we're at a gridlock."
38,stop telling my secrets or else üòÑ
39,Please don't bully anyone
40,"Your post made me sad. My family was accepting, but I dont take that for granted and know there are many like you out there. I hope you can still manage to live your life to the fullest, and know we are thinking of you."
41,Being the quiet kid in the back of the classroom.
42,"I live near a military base and in the end of the afternoon all the guys from there go out to jog

I can't describe the sight"
43,"He was a good boy, he deserves that t.v."
44,I'm shitting my pants just thinking about having that conversation. I don't know if I'm more scared of being turned down or of not being turned down. I guess I do need to just do it and see what happens... Thanks
45,Stole bixers from guys in locker room to sniff and jerk off... Oh and suck cock... Thats pretty gay
46,"Fewer health expense issues, less religious issues, fewer legal issues, better education - none if this is a judgement.

US guys - we have our problems here in the UK but they don't feel as bad when I read your posts. Feel bad for you sometimes *hugs*"
47,"so I get the other stuff, and yes every other app has the same feature, but this whole ""my self-esteem is going to be ruined!"" is indicative of something else. I feel if someone viewing you and not saying hi is going to wreck your self esteem, perhaps you shouldn't take the app so seriously."
48,Feel uncomfortable in the locker room
49,"Also be prepared to be disappointed even if you do make the effort.

üòî"
50,Go to a Sufjan Stevens concert alone
51,"I loathe the man but he's voted pretty consistently in favour of LGBT rights since those comments were made, so that's one thing I'm not really worried about."
52,Put effort into bettering myself?? But that takes time and Reddit is easier!
53,"Literally, the worst. I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre texting or checking your Grindr/tinder messages, but it kills me a little inside."
54,"As a 50 year old the notion of dating someone around the age of anything less than 35 fills me with dread.

Young people are clueless about the world. Young people have very little to actually say conversation wise that I have any interest in what so ever.

I never got the obsession with the young. Young is great when your young and mentally at the same level with similiar interests and points of reference. But when you get older your so different to how you were when you were young. I want someone I can not only fuck but have a meaningful conversation with as well. I often find the mind much more a source of attraction than physicality."
55,"I am sorry I cannot do much more to help, but try here [https://www.rainbowrailroad.com/gethelp](https://www.rainbowrailroad.com/gethelp)  
Definitely run from Russia, it's not that gov is avoiding the problem, from my perspective it's encouraging. There is no future for LGBTQ in Russia until something fundamental will change there."
56,"Oh god you just reminded me of this time... 

I‚Äôd been seeing this guy semi-long distance, when suddenly my brother had passed away, so I flew to the funeral and back. He drove into town to come spend time with me. We didn‚Äôt know each other well, we‚Äôd only just started seeing each other. We were lying in bed...I‚Äôm faced away from him, just totally overwhelmed with everything. 

I roll over, and he‚Äôs talking to some guy on Scruff. I‚Äôm like...dude...we‚Äôre not exclusive obviously, but there‚Äôs a time and a place to do that. What the fuck... 

I asked him to leave my apartment and he called me a dick, then said, ‚ÄúIf this is how you treat people, it‚Äôs no wonder bad things keep happening to you.‚Äù 

I was shaking. I said, ‚ÄúOkay. you need to leave. Right now.‚Äù 

Some fuckin‚Äô people, I swear to god...."
57,One had the audacity to go on his Tinder account while sitting next to me. That was so awkward.
58,"The fem-masc obsession is something that I've rarely found irl (some degree of it in apps tbh, but not much), but I don't know if it's an american thing or just a ""this sub"" thing. 

Also: the apparent focus on status and salary/earnings when looking for a partner and all the issues around religion that american guys seem to face either directly or indirectly (through religious parents and/or communities)"
59,"He is going to be both an embarrassment to himself and to the party. He likes to have others do the work for him. He's lazy. Thankfully, Britain's parliamentary democracy makes it impossible for him not to compromise."
60,I‚Äôm on Grindr but I‚Äôm just looking for attention tbh.
61,you'd be surprised at how many fat old ugly men have 20somethings chasing them. they wouldn't message y'all if they didn't have success.
62,"All true! I quit years ago - it stinks, costs money and will kill you. It literally has no upside."
63,oh and that of courseüíÄ
64,Having Turkish ancestors doesn't mean he's not white.
65,"For me, I think the issue is half-dating, i.e. dating someone while talking to other guys. I feel like many in the community have unrealistic standard. When they meet someone they like, they decide to date them, but still talk to other guys just in case they find someone better."
66,Man I‚Äôm a 6 foot construction worker and 98% of my underwear is what you‚Äôve described. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a problem and to hell with anyone that thinks they have the right to judge
67,Being really good friends with all the girls in my class.
68,"I literally laughed out loud when I saw the news. 
This crazy world."
69,"You might not be gay per se, sexuality is weird so don‚Äôt overthink it. Tell him you like him (I‚Äôm pretty sure he knows after that kiss) and take it from there. If he‚Äôs not feeling it, he‚Äôll still be your best friend. 

You don‚Äôt need to worry about it. If you can just talk through it with him and take it from there. You don‚Äôt even have to think about sex yet. You just know how you feel about him and hopefully he feels the same and you can deal with the sex and your family and other worries if or when your get there. 

Enjoy the feeling and make it apparent how you feel about him."
70,I'm 27. When does it end?
71,"But don't you think some people are genuinely open to both dating and hookups? I don't think those goals are mutually exclusive. Being single sucks there's nothing wrong with a slump buster. And dating is nice too, but that's not always the situation we find ourselves in now is it"
72,"I wouldn‚Äôt be scared of anything, if my straight best friend came to me questioning his sexuality. I would 100% help him if I was attracted to him or not. 

But the fact that he re-engaged the kiss makes me think there might be something there. You got this! Trust your friend and lean on him for support! And then when you two are dating post a cute picture ‚ù§Ô∏è"
73,Okay but that's not fair either. I'm a young dude and I like to date older guys. You cant say that they're into younger guys because they've failed at life...
74,"I'm so sorry. My parents are bombarding me with gay conversion therapy ""literature"" and all kinds of ""being gay is a sin"" crap at the moment so I know how you feel."
75,"Sorry, but I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and one-up you here.  I live in Honolulu, and I go walking a couple miles along one of our beach parks every few evenings.  You think joggers are hot?  Try surfer dudes with ripped bodies all changing at their cars in nothing but a towel, along the sidewalk... just praying that towel falls!  Even better, there‚Äôs also open air showers along the walk where people rinse off sand and saltwater.  Last night, one of the most god-like men was rinsing his surfboard in one, then set it down to rinse himself.  It was literally the hottest thing I think I‚Äôve ever seen.  I could just imagine him naked in the shower at home.  Of course I don‚Äôt stare, but I‚Äôd be a blind fool to not glance.  And since the temperature is the same here, year round, there‚Äôs never a shortage of eye-candy."
76,"Nick Jonas is my favourite body type. He's clearly muscular and seems like he's chill with his body. There's a fact that building more muscle requires a lot of energy. Protein too, but can't really build anything if you don't eat enough. He may be bulking for all we know"
77,Avoid dating or looking queer to stay safe in high school.
78,"Lol. Good tip. I think I‚Äôm good for now. Before I do that, I‚Äôd like to work on getting a few regular FWB‚Äôs going."
79,"People underestimate how much angles and lighting can play a role in how muscular someone looks.  If they turned the right way, or the sun hit them at the right angle, I am sure they would go right back to looking ripped."
80,"I'm 57, not fat and not ugly. I don't use your stupid apps and I have zero interest in young men. I get plenty of attention from hot mature men.

And if I say hi to you at the bar, twink, I'm just being friendly. Don't flatter yourself."
81,"I fantasize about falling asleep immediately after.

Then waking up with a coffee beside me.

I'm really wild like that."
82,He's way too hot and hypnotized by beige buildings everywhere to know that he's suffering
83,You grow a beard And enter the bear community.
84,I used to make a fake account on MySpace lol cuz I wasn‚Äôt out yet. Catfishing before I knew what that was lol üòÇ
85,That's way more elegantly said than how I say it
86,too real.
87,"&gt;‚Äútank topped bum boys‚Äù

That's funny as fuck"
88,"If memory serves, when I was about that age, my hormones went haywire all the time.  It is possible that you are going through a period when your Testosterone levels are fluctuating.  It could also be that you are 17.  Relish these feelings (you may or may not have them your whole life) and also do your best to live your authentic life and don‚Äôt let your hormones get the best of you."
89,Not everyone ages the same way you did.
90,Fair to say the boyfriend's getting split in more ways than one  üëâüòéüëâ
91,I'd argue than anti-intellectualism is dangerous on its own. The concept of completely discounting someone's input on a subject specifically because they are qualified is ridiculous to me.
92,"Same has happened to me, after dinner, after I paid for the food, and the guy was like...‚Äùoh, well, this was just a friend thing, tonight.‚Äù Literally wanted to smack his phone out of his hands."
93,Douching obsession is weird too.
94,Who upvotes this? That is some creepy incel shit.
95,"Yes, it‚Äôs easier for algerians to immigrate to France than any other nationality. Just has to follow the administrative convoluted procedures without missing papers and steps."
96,Thots and prayers*
97,"my boyfriend has scars all over his face and body, gnarly ones too. he‚Äôs also very lanky. but i think he‚Äôs the most perfect person in the world, and his entire appearance is sexy as fuck to me.

there‚Äôs definitely a person out there for you, so i wouldn‚Äôt give up just yet. it‚Äôs going to be more difficult, especially because a lot of people are shallow as hell, but you‚Äôre also not going to be ‚Äúdisfigured‚Äù in a lot of people‚Äôs eyes."
98,"They did. I had the same guy reach for my crotch 3 times! You'd think he'd understand I wasn't interested after I swapped his hand away the first time, but no. Thankfully, I was forewarned by a more experienced friend about these type of incidents so it didn't catch me entirely by surprise."
99,"For the record we didn‚Äôt vote for him, and I can say with some certainty, never will."
100,"What if someone finds you attractive but they're also too shy to approach you. Don't complain about feeling invisible, if you're acting invisible too."
101,"I regularly contribute to Rainbow Railroad, because this is a huge issue.

They seem like a great place to help."
102,i mean you could try ;)
103,More like there‚Äôs a cloning factory in NYC cuz he and Trump are both from New York...
104,"Not a sad rant at all. It's better to get these things out in the open. This is a healing process, the first step. 

I can say that there will be others. In your journey, this was the first of many relationships. Some will end, others develop into best friends, and one will set your shorts on üî•.

So don't worry, remember and cherish those great times you both had, and look forward to the next cute one.

All the best. IMHO."
105,"Yes, there are lots of people who are faithful and into monogamy. I myself have been with the same person for over 10 years.

Also, people can hookup (while not in a relationship) and also be into staying faithful if they're in a committed relationship. Those two things are not mutually exclusive."
106,"...You had an exciting first date and freaked out. It happens. I know it probably feels like you squandered the love of your life, but it really was just a first date. You had a connection, and it sucks that you blew it, but it was just a connection. There will be more, if M doesn't come around.

That said, get a handle on the melodrama here. I know in 2019 it's romantic to imagine yourself as this traumatised soul who couldn't possibly love, but it really isn't that hard. We've all been closeted, we've all been around people who don't get it, but ultimately the responsibility is on us to get over it and move on. You misjudged your brother. You fucked up a first date. All that this means is that you're human like the rest of us. 

Apologise to M for freaking out, respect his silence if he doesn't reply, and do better next time. That's all you can do. In the meantime, if someone seems like they want to date you, assume that they know the risks of a relationship and are willing to take them on. The impulse to not date someone to ""avoid hurting them"" is usually just poorly-disguised fear on your part."
107,I struggle with body image. I don't feel comfortable being shirtless at the gay beach and I have never been to a bathhouse even though I totally could. I am self-conscious about feeling ugly and undesirable.
108,"You aren't pathetic, you're adorable lmao."
109,"Seeing his Instagram and how he seems to be very wealthy, he doesn't need a GoFundMe. A person who lives like that can pay a ticket to somewhere in Europe and just not go back. 

I dunno, this seems kinda fishy."
110,yes according to US penal code 6969 unless a form W19 is filed in advance.
111,Thank you for making my day and showing me this
112,Guys are hot. Just embrace it. Get your dick wet
113,I'd love to suck some daddy dick. Only big bears with bellies and fur.
114,So.... you're with this guy because..... sounds like a serious brat to me.
115,The show ‚ÄúYears and Years‚Äù was meant to be a cautionary tale not a bloody prophecy üòÇ
116,"Nah, that‚Äôs my ideal body on a guy. I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of the ultra-cut 3% body fat look."
117,Yes. We're gay. It's askgaybros. The clue is in the title.
118,"That‚Äôs actually what a ‚Äúdadbod‚Äù is.  Someone who looks like he works out but doesn‚Äôt have much in the way of abs.

But for some reason, the term ended up being co-opted by fat guys."
119,Do you approach average or unattractive guys in clubs?
120,Jerking off to and spying on my best friend on a daily basis; jerking off to straight porn because thats all I had access to at the time.
121,üëå‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è‚¨ÖÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è‚¨ÖÔ∏èü¶¥
122,"Last year when my ex girlfriend cheated on me, my friend said ""don't worry about it, love is shit anyway... let's play Mario Kart"". :D I hope he only said it to make me feel better."
123,"The posts that are like ""I've been douching for 30 minutes and I'm still not clean, what do I do"" and I'm like:

1. It's not that big a deal
2. Clearly you're douching wrong"
124,"This enrages me. 
Give me your parents‚Äô number. I‚Äôd like a word."
125,"Yeah, I did a bit of googling and I haven't really found any ""labels"" that would work for me. It's usually just ""straight except..."". I can't see myself ever being with a guy that isn't him.

I'm sure you're right about him probably knowing how I feel after that kiss, but he didn't say anything. He just smiled and we continued talking about random stuff the rest of the night. I wish he would have said something or asked more about why I did it, maybe I'd have the guts to admit it."
126,"Some guys don‚Äôt know how to take a hint. If you even slightly raise your voice at them, they‚Äôll disappear like cockroaches. Nobody wants that kind of attention at a bathhouse."
127,"Just like any big app, everything they do is geared towards getting you to spend as much time and money on the app.

All big apps and social media networks suffer from this problem."
128,"I can also confirm. Lived in Austin a few years back.

So.Many.Hot.Shirtless.Joggers (with cute dogs).

It was unbelievable."
129,"I‚Äôm not sure if this counts (happened right at 18 first few weeks of college) but ruined many of my friendships when I was forced out by a my gay neighbor in my dorm. I asked to talk because I never met anyone else who was gay before, instead he drunk, gossiped to some people, they knew people from my hometown, and it spreading like wildfire. All happened in the first few weeks of college but I didn‚Äôt know until maybe a month after when a lot of my friends list turned up ghosts- which made it even harder to figure out why. 

Sorry to make this a pitty party but gayest thing I ever did for sure. I‚Äôm over it. 

Second gayest would be finally taking he knot on my medium bad dragon after a month of practice which was also pretty fun."
130,Thank you. I don't buy it one fucking bit lmao. Has 7k instagram followers and thinks his life is worth 6k while there are ppl doing much worse than him.
131,The men's underwear section of the store was my favorite as a kid. That was a good clue. Followed up by not ever being attracted to girls when all my friends started to notice them. I wanted to know what their dicks looked like
132,Boxer briefs in general tbh.
133,Good boy. I love taking my good boy for walks. Except for the fact that I have to vacuum my house every other day during shedding season
134,"Everyone's saying basically the same thing, and they're right--but I'll tell you, too. My husband is exactly like you: otherwise basically straight as an arrow, but stumbled onto what is apparently the first exception to that in his life.

Don't let labels define you. You kissed your friend; you liked it and apparently so did he. Where to go from now? Wherever this leads.

Maybe you really did find your true love right at 18, and you'll be together forever. Maybe your sexuality is more fluid than you thought, and you're some degree of bisexual and just realizing it. Maybe you're pretty much straight and this is a kink you're discovering, and there's no long-term potential here. You can't know until you see where this goes, so don't be afraid to. 

You're 18. You're in the middle of a period of significant change in your life. This could be a permanent thing, or just a quirk of hormones and will be over with soon. The only thing that anyone can tell you is this: whatever it is, *it's not a bad thing.* So don't be afraid of it."
135,Enjoy being 17. You have so much time for so many things. You really want dick right now. It's not permanent. Just enjoy feeling like this. Someday you will be old and will want to remember this feeling. LIve it up while you can.
136,"Straight crush which led me to have a stoner phase since I wanted to be close to him

I guess doing something like that because you like someone is a typical teenager thing, too bad it had to come with the heartbreak of incompatibility

Doesn't help that he was the first person that showed he cared about me after being bullied heavily in middle school either"
137,"It's ok to catch feelings because of the person, regardless of gender, and regardless of your orientation. Love is the greatest thing."
138,"I actually like nutty Boris on some things. 

That said, whoever the PM would've been, they would've been elected to do one thing and that's handle brexit. Boris has said he's willing to do a no deal brexit. That's fucking insane, and so are the torries for fucking their country with this geriatric economic policy that seems to be lost in the dream that Britannia is still an economic powerhouse. 

Oh, also a no deal brexit would place a border in Ireland, something that is universally agreed will lead to people getting shot in the kidney. 

We talk about how dysfunctional the US is, and we are, but idk if I've ever seen a modern day, first world country so hell bent on fucking themselves over for almost no reason whatsoever."
139,Yeah you don't have to shit on younger people to make the point about age differences. I think it's enough to say that a 20 and a 35+ year old are typically going to be in different headspaces or want different things and that's ok.
140,"Yeah, the Vice President of the EU made a press statement after Johnson was announced as PM, that there were not going to be anymore negotiations with the new PM."
141,Or else what?? üòà
142,Trump's a moron who's trying to pretend to be a genius. Boris is a fairly intelligent man [pretending to be an idiot.](https://reaction.life/jeremy-vine-my-boris-story/)
143,"You're overreacting to something that is BARELY a thing.  When I first found out about the Momoa ""controversy"" it was mostly people getting upset about people complaining.  So that the people getting upset get the topic to trend.  

If you're going insane, take a break from the internet."
144,Don't think most in the UK run into religious problems/ people as anyone in the US.
145,But not thumbs to work the remote üëâüòéüëâ
146,"For me that's: drug addict, smoker, alcoholic, non-monogamous, extremely jealous, possessive."
147,Beige is a known method of torture.

If you end up with this guy forever everyone is going to assume you're gay even if he's the only man you're ever attracted to, but it doesn't matter what they think.

The thing which always surprise me, when i read here, is the importance of money. Someone doesn't have a job? Then he's not independent. That's SO WEIRD to read that for me : ""he has to have a job, he has to be able to handle himself"", like if life was some kind of jungle, and and job the proof on anything...

Or some people who say they can not ""go out"" because they have no money (or no car), which is extra-weird for any European living in a big city. Or talks about loans, debts - i know nobody in my friends who has any debt... Seing someone asking how much a medical treatment cost is also kinda exotic.

The second thing is the weight or religion, which seems everywhere. I don't know if it changes a lot of things regarding homophobia (people in Europe don't need religion to be homophobic), but that's still so surprising in a modern society."
199,"Getting old does not always mean getting fat. There are old people who work out a lot and maintain a ripped physique. Most weigh the benefits of being fit at their advanced age and decide against putting in the effort understandably.

I had smoked 420 just to take the edge off, but I guess it made me more in tune with my emotions so when another guy who reminded me of my dad touched my leg I reactively twitched and held up my hand to make him stop. Poor guy probably didn't know what happened, but can imagine him taking it personally--as if he was scary or something. He ran out of the sauna so quick!

The GoFundMe is vague as to what the money will pay for. The description says he needs ‚Ç¨10,0000 but he cut it to ‚Ç¨6,000 for the GoFundMe. It doesn't say how much the visa application is. And there isn't much mention of why he can't get a job now besides that he is a student. Which really doesn't make much sense to me because kids all over the world get a job as a student. And then the pics kind of seem to indicate he isn't exactly poor. There are also no specifics about his current living situation or how he seemingly lives openly gay while living in the country despite such a significant threat. It's just too many unanswered questions for me to donate money."

There were rough periods, but by God were my days (and nights!) varied and interesting!

I have been pleasantly surprised though, to discover, after leaving the scene, that it was (and is) such a tiny slice of a world that‚Äôs even bigger and more wondrous than I could have imagined. 

My tastes have matured, mellowed and metamorphosed in the 16 years since I turned 30 and though I have no regrets over my previous incarnation, I‚Äôm excited for my future, free from the laser-sharp judgementality of the babygays, whom I‚Äôm hoping will experience the many epiphanies that come with advanced years. Youth may well be wasted on the young, but I‚Äôd offer the caveat that this is only true if they believe they‚Äôll be forever young...taste every moment! x"

Someone to cuddle to sleep and chit chat about whatever.

233,"Speaking as a doppelbanger, I'm already there, mate."
234,"Not European (Australian) but I noticed that some commenters have really strong opinions about age differences. Like some people say it MUST be predatory manipulation if a 27 year old has sex with someone who's just turned 18. Or ""why would a 25 year old want to get involved with a 19 year old? Something's not right"". 

Meanwhile I'm sitting here thinking: age of consent here is 16. I was graduated from high school and completed my first year of university at 17. And at 18 you get all the freedoms and responsibilities of adults. Sometimes an 18 year old simply is mature enough to decide to sleep with someone older than them. 

Also, there's far less worrying about masc/fem tops or bottoms. Most people here are pretty comfortable with what they like, and aren't so strongly influenced by porn culture."

238,"Dude - as an ex smoker I can honestly say - you are an addict. 

You will literally say anything to justify your addiction - no judgement, I did the same thing! 

'Learn good hygiene' - no. We can tell. A non-smoker can always tell. You might not smell it but we can. Brutal honesty here - you reek. Unless you're washing your hair after every cigarette, showering, changing your clothes and downing an entire bottle of listerine after every cigarette - we can tell.

The reduction if stress? Also no. A lot of the reason you're stressed is the nicotine withdrawl!!! I remember the feeling - it's like anxiety and stress and worry and panic all rolled into one - when I stopped smoking it disappeared - you're smoking to chase the feeling of calm - because your brain is screaming for relief from withdrawal.

When you quit - especially if you're a heavy smoker - food tastes amazing, you can smell things, your stress levels drop through the floor, you have more ¬£$¬£ to spend on yourself, you don't stink up the room and you're less likely to die of the 1000's of illnesses smoking can cause.

I know all that was harsh so I apologise for that - you do you - so long as you're happy! But as an ex smoker I say again - it has no upsides. Self-justifiction is a powerful mental tool, but can also work against you. *hugs*"

255,"&gt;But if you were a happy, well adjusted 40 something, would *you* want a partner you have nothing in common with, who is financial dead weight and who is physically in a very different place than yourself?

Yeah, if I'm single and he comes along and wants me and we get along well. Frankly I've been out of the closet for 30 years and Mr Rights are few and far between, and a guy comes along and we get along well and we think each other are sexy and he happens to be young and not financially able to keep up with me because of his age and doesn't know anything about my interests... I can *teach* him about sewing and knitting and cooking and music and architecture and flowers and art and dogs and travel (if we get along well he's going to have an active enough mind to want to learn and be kind enough that he is willing to pick things up from me over time), and there's a *reason* I literally killed myself to earn enough money to be able to be a good provider.

If he wants a decrepit old man who is kinda hanging on to life but who has decades of experience behind him and a lifetime of trying to be a good and interesting person, who am I to argue? It actually used to be quite common among gay men that older man A would have a relationship with younger man B, and eventually after man A dies, man B has gotten older and has a relationship with younger man C, to whom he can pass on the money and possessions and the cycle can continue. No, by no means is it necessary that anyone in particular has to be into this, but among guys who are, it's a way of life that works."

258,"Sorry I just pictured him,  ass up texting while you fuck him and couldn't stop laughing. 

Seriously though, do it back to him. Either he'll notice or he won't. 

Maybe just ignore him completely and when he finally notices you've moved out, taken the furniture, the food and TV and rent is due he'll realize what a complete tool he is. 

Or you could just accept that he's an inconsiderate twirp and you should've dumped his ass a long time ago."
259,I don't smoke but I don't really mind guys who do.
260,Yep - anything with 'cooling' or sensation coatings are not meant for bum-fun! I tried a warming lube once - never again! Felt like I'd been raped by a blowtorch.... ü§£
261,"It's *worthwhile* to come out, imo.  

When I was in the closet, acting like I'm into girls and trying to ""blend in"" with my straight friends is exhaustive.  I'd need to constantly mind my pronouns and when I would do something gay centric (or sometimes even suggest I was gay) I'd just shrug and talk in very vague terms.  Like, ""I watched this awesome movie called Weekend and omg it was so good"" turned into ""I don't know.  I didn't do much.  How was your weekend?""   

I'm just free to make small talk and be myself and it's soooo much easier.  You don't need to actively come out with a megaphone with everyone you meet, but don't lead them onto thinking you're straight.  If they ask if you have a girlfriend, don't just say ""No"" (even though that's literally true), say ""nah.  I'm into dudes.  But I don't have a boyfriend either so about the same"""
262,Oh it is so disgusting and horrible!  Now a days the costs are ridiculous!  Some places have a pack of smokes at $15.... $15!!!!   I started smoking and they were 75 cents a pack!

280,"That wasn't his point.  First of all, the thread says that ""We always talk about old men with such disdain"" and that was hardly disdain.  But that's a separate issue.  

To be very simplistic, here are some examples:  People who were born in the 90s and around 2000 will have no idea what the world was like before 9/11, for example.  The same cohort will not get pop culture references to movies and TV shows on in the 90s.  I've run into this already with quoting a very infamous movie that was out in 97 with someone who was 25.  They were ""clueless"" about it.   Further, younger people (for obvious financial reasons and because they're in school) are less likely to have traveled much / left the country or experienced nearly as much in their careers...which is a big topic of conversation.  It's really not that complicated of a concept that he's trying to get across.  You also took the statement out of context because he was talking about having *conversations* with them as I also reiterated above.  This was the rest of his sentiment that you did not quote:

&gt; Young people have very little to actually say *conversation* wise that I have any interest in what so ever.

That's the main point.  I could write several more paragraphs about this but apparently you think its indecent and disrespectful to point out these basic things &amp; so I doubt it'll change your mind.  But for other people reading this thread, that was clearly the point.
