0,"Lol that‚Äôs honestly funny... like it‚Äôs cute he wanted to make you breakfast, It‚Äôs just a toaster bro... get to know him a little more "
1,"I saw a room for rent advert once, it described the room area etc then ended with 2 funny sentences: ""Housemates are Muslim, you must be tolerant if you want to live here.  No homosexuals."""
2,I thought this was going to turn into a story about getting robbed. Sucks about your toaster but at least there's some innocence behind it.
3,Hahaha that is completely adorable. Although too fast for all that. I think you should talk to him and explain you aren‚Äôt really looking for that type of attention. Let him get you the new toaster.
4,OP got mad at a guy for not asking permission to use a toaster. Should be a red flag for the other dude. Probably slept on couch and ran because OP is cray cray. 
5,"A week ago, me and a very conservative and introverted colleague of mine were traveling for business. 

While at dinner, he asked me what my aspirations were within the company. He continued the conversation by expressing his appreciation for what I contribute to the team, and that ‚Äúthe boat would sink‚Äù without my ambition. He finished by stating that he wanted to share something with me. 

He said, ‚ÄúYour sincerity and genuine care to make a difference changed my views on homosexuality.‚Äù

He admitted that he was homophobic before meeting me - because he grew up in an openly homophobic home - but after working together for a few years, he‚Äôd finally reached a place where he felt comfortable enough to share the impact I had made on him - and that because of it, he now sees the world a little bit differently. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre you. You‚Äôre human. You‚Äôre a good human. And you‚Äôre one of the most incredible humans I‚Äôve ever met.  You deserve to go as far as you want to go, and you‚Äôll always have my support.‚Äù 

It was honestly one of the most validating moments I‚Äôve ever experienced, and I now feel a little more whole. 

Edit: grammar, changed homophonic to homophobic "
6,In all my years of dating I've never never had someone even attempt to make me breakfast. This guy deserves a second chance...but also supervision while cooking. 
7,That's the climate around a lot of the world when it comes to gays. 
8,*Ironic*
9,"So that's basically the end of tumblr then. It completely obliterates my page for sure lol. I like post 97% porn, 1% NSFW gifs and memes, 1% pokemon, 1% SFW memes and gifs"
10,Good for you. Now go kiss him and tell him how much you love him. 
11,OP is the red flag for sure.
12,"Just on Thanksgiving I was talking to my aunt with CP and she asked if I was dating anyone (which I am) but I told her no. My family is made up completely of conservative Christians and when she asked why I wasn't I told her because everyone here wouldn't approve. She looked me dead in the eye and said ""I would"" and my heart melted. "
13,"Right?! I'm so confused by the negative response. This is cute and hilarious!

Honestly my first thought (before reading the end) was ""I bet he tried to make breakfast, started a fire, panicked, and disposed of the evidence."" \*reads to end\* Yep!

I have definitely done something like this, but it was more along the lines of overflowing a coffee maker and sending boiling hot partially brewed coffee and grounds everywhere. Oops. It's hazardous using unfamiliar appliances!"
14,"seems good enough, and kudos to you for being an honest man."
15,I hate it when they say they‚Äôre cool with wrapped then in the middle of foreplay they pressure you to do bare like that‚Äôs not cool.
16,"I see, well send him an asshole pic and tell him when he gets home dinner is ready. 

Edit: a word."
17,"I‚Äôve been well aware of the disgusting homophobia still exhibited by supposed progressive young people in the workplace. Fortunately for me, I can pass for straight so many homophobes on the job assume I‚Äôm one of them and they let loose with the vitriolic toxic rhetoric about gays. It‚Äôs disgusting, and I always make sure to tell them I don‚Äôt wanna hear that shit. "
18,I came off liking the burnt toaster guy way more than OP
19,"You are the parent that we don't deserve but we need. I wished my parents actually cared about my well-being and sexual health, but no, they stopped asking questions altogether since I came out as gay. For some reason, after coming out as gay all sex-related topic became taboo :/ props to you for mustering the courage to ask!

I would say that gay-sex talk and straight-sex talk is no different from each other: remember to stress the importance of using condom and lubrication, and he always reserves the right to say no even though he agreed to something beforehand: refer to the [sexual consent explained as tea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQbei5JGiT8) video, it is digestible and easily understandable.

Also, remind him that you will *always* be there if he needs somebody to talk to. Keeping a channel open and ready for conversation means the world to a lot of kids."
20,Guarantee they block perfectly PG sites with LGBT content. That's the problem with these types of filters. LGBT topics are ***always*** blocked with a broad stroke while sites composed of chicks in nothing but thongs drenching themselves in milk remain available.
21,"Yeah... I'm usually there for everyone and I'll listen and give advice to them, yet they're never there when I need them."
22,"Post-nut syndrome. It's nothing unique, lots of guys get the feeling every now and then or all the time"
23,Uhm yeah... at least he tried to make it up...  Why don't you give him a second chance? 
24,i cant hes at work
25,It sounds like it was a perfect date! You did good. 
26,"I probably would have ended up dropping out of college during my first semester, had it not been for my roommate, as I didn't initially take my change in circumstances very well. I was dealing with culture shock, serious homesickness, separation from family who I'm very close with, and had just ended the two year relationship I'd had with my first boyfriend. The latter was made even worse for me because neither of us wanted to break up, and to this day we acknowledge that we'd almost certainly still be together had we been able to go to the same university.

He was basically determined not to let me brood in our room between classes, and more or less badgered me into getting out, having some fun, and being more social until I'd snapped out of it. I doubt he'd ever admit it, but I'm pretty sure this wasn't just because he didn't want a lame roommate putting a damper on his crazy brand of fun. I do owe him a lot for that, and he was a very cool roommate.

He wasn't made aware that I'm bisexual until we were no longer roommates, but just found it humorous that he'd never picked up on that. He did figure part of my problem at the time was a breakup, but he'd just assumed it was an ex-girlfriend back home."
27,I like Carlin's view on it. Unless they are having sex in your front yard or waving their dicks around in front of you just leave them alone!
28,I‚Äôm glad you stuck up for your principles. He‚Äôs the one with the problem. 
29,Ill probably get downvoted but i cant support islam from the homophobia and hatred I‚Äôve experienced by angry muslim men and women. Its ridiculous like some christians promote discrimination but not like what I‚Äôve experienced from muslims
30,"That is a hard and fast line for me. If I am meeting you off the internet for random sex, I don't care if you are on PrEP. Condom it is. Yes, other shit is (presently) treatable, but no. "
31,"Be your own best friend. 

I was in the same place once and I got tired of it. So I decided to learn more about my self. 
Started to edit my list of friends and cut out the ones that were not real. 
Started to dedicate time for me, take myself out on dates. Just do things that called my attention, so that I can learn more about my self. 

I said to myself, ‚Äújust because I might end up single for the rest of my life, that doesn‚Äôt mean that I have to let my self go. I need to take care of my health, body and mental health. Learn how to self motivate myself and make a good adult out of me‚Äù 

My 20s are about me, myself and I. 

"
32,Who said romance is dead üòçüòç
33,"By shouting (in the middle of a group) ""I knew it!"" you're making it about you, stealing the spotlight, and causing the rest of the group to assess the friends' previous behavior instead of focusing on the now.  Don't do that; you did good to hold your tongue.  

Having a side conversation to the tune of ""I kinda suspected beforehand.  I still love you dude"" is not-rude and welcome.  "
34,Women. 
35,I was in the hospital for a week. My husband was with me every day. Every nurse and Doctor addressed us both as a couple. Every conversation. Was incredible to feel validated as a married couple. 
36,"Holy.Fucking.Shit 

The devil possessed and fucked you from the inside out."
37,"Honestly what your date did sounds like something that I would do. I am adhd and super clumsy. I can totally find fantastic ways to try and do something nice and make some ridiculous mess. Honestly some times the most logical option seems like its to panic. Its definitely ridiculous what happened but I mean doesn't seem malicious haha pretty comical to be honest

&amp;#x200B;"
38,"Awesome! Sucks you didn't get the date, but that's a huge thing to get comfortable doing. Hopefully next time works out better."
39,Happens all the fucking time. Even had a guy says he always plays safe then literally tries to stick it in raw with spit üò´. And I have to be the one telling him to put the condom on. 
40,The usual stuff plus using lube (water or silicone based and the simplest available). Not using lube may result in condoms breaking and discomfort. 
41,I‚Äôve seen this porn
42,relationships only work if honesty is involved. just be frank with him. say your not comfortable being dominant in bed and you'd like to lighten the kink in the relationship. tell him how you feel and that the idea of using abuse in a sexual nature makes you feel very uncomfortable and that you don't want nor like the idea of hurting him.  tell him your limits (how far your willing to go sexually) and see if he's ok with that. if he's not then the relationship was doomed to begin with
43,Same with me. Everything is disgusting after cumming üòÇ 
44,no were human people
45,I read this as ‚ÄúI finally asked a guy out in prison‚Äù üòÇ
46,"I would add in which part of your body you contracted it (i.e. oral, anal, or genital) as that can assist in assessing exposure, identifying potential symptoms, and figuring out who they may have passed it on to."
47,"Pretty much. Give it a few months and they'll be like, ""fuck, we're dying, just kidding, bring back the porn!"" "
48,You need to chill. 
49,"It seems rather absurd to me that someone profiting from a service that facilitates easy gay sex feels compelled to publicize his own fine moral distinctions. 

Sorry, honey, you're the madame of a big virtual whorehouse.  "
50,"&gt; The usual stuff plus using lube

I'm so glad I've never had a talk about this with my parents..."
51,at the supermarket 5 cent each
52,"my sims are unrelated to me, furries, and one of them is a ghost. they have sick-ass visible-dicks-through-transparent-body-parts ghost sex 

but I decided the alpaca-shaped dog I got for them was boring and when I put it up for adoption, my actual self-sim was chosen as the animal care guy who came to pick him up, so I mean he's got that going for him

even my self-sim is tangentially related to the lives of everyone he knows oof"
53,"Also, he had the heat on blast that it was uncomfortable for the guy you invited over to spend the night? He didn't turn it down, turn on a fan, or open a window but, ""yea, you can sleep on the couch."" "
54,A red flag. You read a red flag.
55,"Younger brother--former frat guy in college, super broey, into powerlifting, the works. A guy you'd think would be all about ""no homo"" and the like. Anyway he's in grad school in another state and told me about a time when a classmate made a disparaging remark about West Hollywood and ""the gays."" Without flinching my brother stood up to him and all the snickering about how it's 2018 and they need to grow the fuck up. Made me feel warm and fuzzy inside to hear him essentially stand up for me even when I wasn't there. Coupled with stress from school I've been feeling pretty lonely and down lately (doesn't help that we came from a rather homophobic upbringing), so this was uplifting to hear. It's always been just us two and it's definitely brought us closer &lt;3"
56,Rather cute innocent story. Me thinks you are over reacting.
57,"Imagine being the guy on the couch, some guy just fucked you and makes you sleep away from him.  and then freaks out about some toast."
58,Big fat bears keep ya warm in winter.
59,"obligatory: pics for proof! 

&amp;#x200B;"
60,I'm with you 100%. It drives me crazy how so many liberals defend Islam in the name of tolerance but the homophobia and sexism in the culture is so extreme that I could never defend it. It's my one big gripe with my party. 
61,Your best friend is amazing. That actually warmed my icy cold heart üôà
62,RIP Tumblr 
63,"I was working at a regional hospital that had a softball event. People were drunk and yelling ""faggot"" during the game. The CEO was there and he didn't care to address it. People suck."
64,"Yeah, might make them feel uncomfortable. "
65,"He could save others from being intolerant, but not himself."
66,"See, where I'm from, a Grindr date gone wrong is you got catfished and he murders you. "
67,"Damn, you‚Äôve been putting that work in eh?"
68,"We both got the idea to try role play from porn. Except every time it came to him he busted out laughing. He couldn't compose himself and we both ended up losing our boners lmao

Also sex on the beach..... Sand. In crevices that should *not* have sand in them. "
69,"It's funny how just reading something like this can snap you back into reality and a good mood. I've been so depressed over this guy because we were going great and then he got all weird and stopped talking to me, not showing any interest, blah blah. But dammit your right! thanks :)"
70,"Dude you handle the situation like a proper adult, dont question yourself anyone who would be mad that they didnt get more, then you know thats all they are after and you are probably better off without them. Well done young man."
71,"One of my exes had a horrifyingly awkward no-face-pic hookup. He'd been chatting with this guy and finally invited him over. When the guy arrived, my ex opened the door, and **it was his psychotherapist.**

And, no, they did not hook up. 

Edit: I think this happened back around 2000, on gay.com, and the norms of online behavior that are now standard were still being worked out. Also, many people didn't yet have digital cameras. I know my ex had a pretty primitive computer setup and was on a dialup modem. "
72,"&gt; I‚Äôve never actually spoken to them since we work in different areas, but i‚Äôve seen one of them on Grindr. He seems to be a normal, nice guy, but at work no one gives a shit about that, he‚Äôs just a faggot. He‚Äôs a faggot before anything else.

Personally, I would send the one on Grindr a short message of support and respect, and ask him to discreetly pass it on to the other guy. Sometimes it helps to know that you're not alone.
"
73,It‚Äôs only ‚Äúsocially acceptable‚Äù if either 1.) you‚Äôre in shape or 2.) there‚Äôs a body of water nearby.
74,Yes. Very much so
75,"On one of my first dates with my current bf, about 1 1/2 years ago, we were walking some trails in a nature park. A couple came up to us and the girl said something along the lines of ""we just wanted to say you two look so cute holding hands. It's really great that you're so open like this. Fuck the haters, you guys are awesome.""

It was nice of them, but also kind of embarrassing. It was one of our first few dates and neither of us were really ""out"" per se. Also the girl pointed out that her bf was bi, which I thought was odd.

But it mostly just gave us the giggles that someone would notice us and think we were worth talking to, so it was a nice memory."
76,I *like* her.

80,"Yeah. I‚Äôve bounced around different tech companies over the years and it‚Äôs at all levels. It was really bad at one company though. The moment people feel like you‚Äôre safe or part of their in group the flood gates slam open. Oh Mr Burro? You‚Äôre an army veteran like me?! Let me rant at you my abhorrent thoughts on the queers! When I left that place as was doing an exist interview, some incidents were brought as it related to me never wanting to work for them again. But the HR Director flatly told me that this place was the first company he‚Äôs worked at in 25 years where he didn‚Äôt feel safe to have a photo of his partner on his desk. And that fear was tied to a couple of c-levels"

96,"I‚Äôm the super-intendant of an apartment complex and I just moved in a couple into an apartment this last month. They just immigrated from Russia and they are a gay couple. They are really nice and don‚Äôt speak much English or French so it makes it very difficult to communicate but I can‚Äôt imagine what they went through fleeing from Russia. Luckily they seem to have a very strong and supportive community here in the city  which is just great. 

Oh and I did not feel the need to tell the landlord of the building about how they are a homosexual couple. He is an elderly man and I have had past experiences of him being prejudice and racist and sexist so I just decided that there was no reason at all to mention they‚Äôre sexual orientation to him. It makes no difference to me and it should not matter to him so I just left it out purposefully. "

We were alone near the end of the night and very drunk. He asked me if he could show me his dick because he wanted a gay guys opinion. I said of course...it was lovely...but knowing he was straight I kinda looked away and was a bit like wtf. Anyway I went back to my friends house that night and he messaged me on Facebook at like 4am and said ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt show me yours‚Äù

107,"This is my concern.   If they are going to have their filter automatically block a specific common site like PornHub it‚Äôs not a big deal.  
  But I once put money into a coin-operated computer at the mall and I soon found that it was filtered and I could not look at practically anything an adult might look at.  I got frustrated and checked out the filter by trying keywords like ‚ÄúTowleroad,‚Äù and ‚Äúbreast cancer‚Äù and it was blocked.  Any news article mentioning the name Dick Cheney was blocked. I tried to log into my local public school board‚Äôs site and it was blocked.  I got home and checked their webpage and saw the reason: a sign-up link for an information session on ‚Äúhow to discuss sex in your family.‚Äù

After like 20 minutes I said my legs were numb and then he said he was cold so he went to lay in my bed under the sheets. I told him I‚Äôd prefer if he didn‚Äôt do that cus I used to be a bit of a germaphobe and didn‚Äôt like people touching my sheets. Then he said that I probably would hate it if he went naked under the sheets, and I said yeah that sounds terrible. He left my room and I didn‚Äôt realize what happened until like 2 years later lol."
112,"&gt;implying I hate middle eastern people because I don't think of them as progressive

OK work"
113,"Honestly the sex talk is more or less the same for gay kids. With the addition of using lube. Make sure you stress the importance of condoms. Just because you can't get pregnant doesn't mean you can't get STDs. Even with a boyfriend ensure he knows to have them both get tested before they decide to go without a condom. 

Also, stress the importance of lube. Like, it's rare but anal without lube can lead to an anal prolapse. I'm fairly sure no one wants that. 

Edit: additionally, if he doesn't have the best grasp on actions/consequences, make sure you get through to him on like, consent and what not. Tell him that he doesn't have to be peer pressured into sexual acts or anything. Not to say this boyfriend may do that. But it's always a possibility with current and/or future partners. 

Edit 2: save your son some money and let him know most pharmacies sell a generic brand lube for way cheaper than KY Jelly and all those other brandsb "
114,"100%. I'm that guy who is there for a lot of people, and never tries to start drama, always tries to go above and beyond for my friends...but no one asks me about my day or tries to remember what's going on in my life.

I would have literally laughed my ass off if a guy I dated did this.

I once came home from work to see nearly every pan and pot I had stacked in the sink and on top of the stove. I was pretty annoyed at the mess and asked my ex, who was head down at his laptop at the kitchen table, ""What the fuck...?"" And he goes, ""I was trying to fry an egg."" And I asked, ""In a pot?!"" And he goes, ""*Clearly* I used up all the pans!"""

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt think that posting that essay was a good idea. I think it was rather inappropriate but he wasn‚Äôt advocating for violence and he wasn‚Äôt attacking anyone.

He tried so hard to be cute and sweet. Like... d'aww, come on man. He wanted to cook for you?? That is sweet as hell! I'd be really flattered if anyone wanted to do that for me.

Call him, ask him to go to Target together and get a new toaster, then take him back and fuck him again. Then give him a second shot at making you some food.

He sounds so clumsily cute, and I would be totally into a guy like that. His reaction of taking the toaster shows he cared enough to not want your place to catch fire, but he was also so embarrassed that he left. I'd have done the same in his situation."

Out of character, I flirted him up and got his snapchat, super into him... only to find out at the end of the D&amp;D that he ironically was my best friend‚Äôs boyfriend (and had been for quite a long time)!

I felt the need to bring it up to them at some point though just so I didn‚Äôt carry any guilt or sense of needing to hide something, so I told her and while she was completely fine with it and found it funny, I was hesitant as to how he‚Äôd react because we were newly friends and I didn‚Äôt want to change anything or scare him off. 

Welp, he didn‚Äôt give a shit. He laughed about it with me and the only thing that actually changed between us is the fact that the most sarcastic bastard I know now has this shit on me and can tease me about it anytime he wants to -_- 

I‚Äôm really grateful he was so cool about it because he‚Äôs grown to be my best friend and I‚Äôm grateful to have him in my life.

Regardless of whether you ‚Äúpushed‚Äù him too much, he‚Äôs way too old to be having destructive and assaultive outbursts, let alone walk into a house you both live in and fail to acknowledge you. Whatever happened at work should have stayed there, there‚Äôs zero reason for him to project that anger on to you. 

It‚Äôs typical to think that if you left him alone, maybe he wouldn‚Äôt have freaked out, but if not this time, then when? And if there was a this time, when will the next time be? Will his punch hit your face instead of the wall next time? 

You obviously have a kind heart. Please don‚Äôt waste it. Please think of yourself because at the end of the day that‚Äôs what matters, and once you get stuck in a cycle of abuse, it takes everything you have to get out of it. "

And this guy looked like what you might think when someone says redneck. He noticed my discomfort and started saying something to the tune of ""I'm so sorry if I was rude, if you're into guys that's fine too."" I was a bit surprised, never expected someone like him to say something like that. I felt kind of bad for breaking my own rule of don't judge a book by it's cover.

192,"Make a [""Want, Will, Won't""](https://youtu.be/xoYxd3E3UXU) chart each.

Basically make three columns and put what you want to do in bed, something that really gets you off. What you're willing to do, stuff you're okay with but it isn't a priority. And what you won't do, absolutely no, hard limits. 

Both of you do this without influence from the other. So you shouldn't put feet in the want just because you think your bf wants it, it has to be honest and real of how you feel about things. But after you make the charts, review them together, and compare.

The things on both wants, you'll definitely do, things on one ""will"" and another's ""want"" do but not too often, this is where the negotiation and compromises come in. Like you would put feet on the will list, and he puts it on the want list, so you can compromise and do it. And if something is on a ""won't"", never do it, it's not even up for negotiation.

Kink is all about negotiation and respect. If your boyfriend cannot accept that you cannot provide for every kink he has, that's an issue. It actually is showing if he is accusing you of controlling and jealousy for not being comfortable with sleeping with one of YOUR friends, then he is not respecting you. It doesn't seem that you're saying no to threesomes, but that it's a no for now, or it's a no with this specific guy (there is probably more so idk).

It is clear that your issue is less of wanting to tone it down, and more that your boyfriend is not respecting your boundaries and limits. If your boyfriend calls you controlling or jealous because you have limits, that you are not okay with doing every kink, that gets into manipulation territory with him making you feel bad for not giving him what he wants. And that is were you can start your conversation with him. How you cannot provide everything for him, and he cannot be mad that you cannot provide everything for him. 

My final suggestion, and don't do this until you are on better groups, if at all, is to maybe open up the relationship. It allows for him to explore his kinks open and honestly, without you doing things your uncomfortable with. You two will still have the emotional connection, but he will have a release. But don't do this if you are uncomfortable with doing it!!! Never feel like you have to do something that makes you uncomfortable just to make your partner happy.

Edit: added a video that is where I got the ""want, will, won't"" list from and does a much better job explaining it!"

Movies, Ads, Media, Online, and especially Video Games are full to the brim with inhumanly sexy women. Sexualized in so many creative ways that it's insane. Meanwhile the most I can hope for is occasionally seeing a fit guy without a shirt.

I can only imagine how much more I'd like Game of Thrones if it had half as many sexy men doing nude scenes as it does women. Or if sexy scantily clad men in videogames were so commonplace that the rare appearance of a male character that is actually fully clothed is celebrated as a menimist icon.

261,"Last night at the Fleetwood Mac concert in Sacramento. There was a 25ish young , attractive male couple, one of them quite buff. Obviously boyfriends, though not making out or anything. A brooding disagreeable man behind them demanded that they not stand at all. But a lot of people were standing, when Stevie Nicks starts twirling around it's hard to stay seated. The cute couple leaves for awhile and comes back, by then it's the last few songs and Christine is humming away ""You make loving Fun"" and now this brooding guy has enlisted those around him into a small mob to demand they sit. They sit for awhile but come-on, Stevie rips into ""Free-Fallin, ""Im gonna write your name in the stars."" So when they stand people start yelling faggot at them. Mind you, they don't say anything about the others standing. One woman yelling ""faggots"" is this elegant 55ish with a pink stripe in her hair (yea, guess that stereotype didn't hold up well.) Someone alerts security and security sides with the gays and demands they leave. They go but not before a few more threats and ""faggots"" and the lady throws her drink in the buff ones face. 

The last song is a duet between Stevie and Christine ""it's time to say goodnight and finally turn out the light"" ... so I walk up to them, the buff one is crying now and I hug them both. I point to my friends and tell them ""we all have your back."" I tell them you are already way ahead, because the homophobes have to be them. 

I think the buff guy stopped crying and his BF hugged me back and said, "" I know , I felt your energy the whole time.""

If he'd posted the same story but said you have been distant and not showing affection and now going to have drinks with someone you've dated in the past everyone would tell him you're a cheating bastard and to dump you. Personally, I think you both need to compromise. He tells you what he wants - more attention and affection. You tell him what you want - more space and trust. I think you should give an honest effort to work on it, then break up if it still isn't working. Communication is key "

I think ""love yourself first"" is bullshit, but if you expect a boyfriend to make you happy, well he might, or you might discover a year in you're just as lonely. "
269,"UGH THIS IS SO HEARTWARMING!! Coming for a Taiwanese-American family as a 1.5 gen, it has been hard. I‚Äôm happy for you because for me, my grandmother moved back to Taiwan and the last thing she told me was that I was a disgrace to the family and that I waste my mom‚Äôs hard work and my grandfather‚Äôs life."
270,"I didn't watch love Simon, because I could tell from the trailers that seeing him have his sexuality would just spark too much emotion in me. I've seen some ads for Boy Erased and it looks like it would hit too close to home also. I go to the movies to be taken away for two hours, not to be reminded of everything that makes me sad. And to be reminded of that with a bunch of people around not feeling the same thing would just be alienating"

273,"I'm bi, and dated a single mom in my early twenties. A couple of years ago, her son chatted me up.  I was fifty, he was in his early thirties.

Awkward."
274,"This is exactly what you need to tell him.

During the discussion, pick up on how much he respects your position in this. 

If he asks you questions to better understand and accepts your limits, you‚Äôre good.

If he doesn‚Äôt and he insists or tries to force you, you‚Äôll have to say clearly that you need to respect yourself and your feelings most of all. 

Don‚Äôt keep doing something you don‚Äôt feel ok with, especially when it‚Äôs about sex. "
275,I'm pissed. Tumblr is a safe way to watch porn or pics. If I wanted a pg meme community sharing app I'd download Facebook! Fuck tumblr. I hope they completely go under and get replaced with someone who actually knows what people want.

280,"Back in the 80s they used to make these things called Pillow People. My brother and I both had one that we'd held onto for years. When I was 12 I started getting boyish urges and really wanted to know what it would feel like to hump the pillow. But I thought if I did it to mine my mom and dad would notice too quickly... so I stole my brother's and cut a hole out in the mouth area. Weirdest orgasm I've ever had. 

Also, when I realized my brother would beat my ass if he figured it out, I proceeded to rip it to shreds and blame the dog for destroying it. "
