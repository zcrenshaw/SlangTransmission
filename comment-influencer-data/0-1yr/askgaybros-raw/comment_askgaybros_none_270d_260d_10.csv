0,"I'm a mother. I hang out here, mostly lurking, because I have a gay son. I want to understand the cultural, legal, and rights-based issues he'll face as he gets older, but I can find that info all over the place. What you guys teach me is a lot of the day-to-day social stuff he'll deal with. Subjects like this one: it never would have occurred to me on my own that my son is likely to have his heart broken a lot more than my daughters will, just because the smaller dating pool is by nature going to cause him to be rejected more than my girls will be. They'll all fall for a lot of straight guys and the occasional gay guy, but that works out fine for my girls, and not so well for my son. 

I'm here because I love my son and I want to be able to relate to him and support him. I can't imagine any mother who loves her children is going to die inside because both of her sons are gay, just for the fact of being gay. If she's hurting at all about it, it's probably sadness that maybe not only one, but *both* of her sons may face more difficult social situations, more cruelty, more rejection, and have a harder time finding partners. I assume she loves you, and that being the case, it seems like a fair guess that finding out her sons might *both* be gay would just make her twice as worried about her children's happiness and well-being. Not any unhappiness about your or your brother's gayness in itself.

Edit:

Several people have brought up the subject of grandchildren, which I had overlooked. I figured I'd copy my response here to save repetition.

Yes. I realized after I wrote it that grandchildren are a concern of a lot of parents that I forgot to give credence to. I already know I will die young - this will probably be my last Christmas. Because of that, I have already come to terms with never seeing grandchildren, or even seeing my children graduate high school, get their first cars, etc. Without realizing it, I think I have come to start thinking of my own legacy very differently than most parents do. I think of it as what I teach my children now, that will affect who they will be in the future. I hope I can teach them to make the world better for their own children if they have any, but mostly for everyone their lives affect. Because of my own circumstances making grandchildren such a non-factor, I simply forgot to factor it into my attempt to relate to OP's mom. You are absolutely right."
1,"I am a stocky bear.  My ex was a twink.  He got similar crap from other twinks.  At the same time, I got crap from other bears for dating a non-bear.   There really is no winning.  "
2,"Sorry, dude... :( that’s quite painful to hear I’m sure.

Consider yourself part of the collective gay family. We don’t think you’re a piece a shit."
3,There are weirder kinks out there.
4,"I think it’s worth mentioning how I know my mom would die inside. In my human genetics class, we learned that if one twin is gay then the other twin has a higher chance of also being gay compared to the general population. When I told my mom that, she had a disapproving look on her face and said “you mean he’s gay, too?” So, yeah, I know deep down she would hate to have two gay sons. "
5,"Dad walked in on me with a childhood friend. We got hammered the night before and woke up naked next to each other we zero clue what happened the previous night. We were spooning and I had my head in his neck when I heard the door open. It was like deer in the headlights. He didn’t know said friend was gay, luckily we were under the covers so he didn’t see anything. But he knew what was up.

When my friend came out to his family word spread and my mum mentioned it one day like “I didn’t know John was gay” to which my dad mumbled under his breath “I did...”"
6,"&gt; IM NOT THAT HOT

You're hot enough to get someone to come from the excitement of looking at your naked ass.

Be proud lmao. "
7,"20, which I think is too old for this bullshit. "
8,"Hey mate, some simple advice for this and arguably most relationships.

Be grateful and take this for what it is, interest in you. If you want to text and meet him for a drink then be interested it’s a drink. Don’t build a future into every exchange, take each interaction and live in the moment."
9,"A lot of young guys who can be described as ""twinks"" think that they are the perfect object of gay desire, because their bodies are the type that are most seen in mainstream gay porn. 

Same thing with the bears who think they're the pinnacle of manliness and masculinity and that anyone who would fuck a twink might as well just fuck a girl. They place too much value in things like beards and hair, thinking that they make a man more of a man. 

People are bitchy and cliquey, and it feels like the gay community is extra susceptible to this kind of tribalism.  Just let people like who they like and mind your own fucking business. "
10,FYI Kids: this is how you dated before hook-up apps. 
11,"I don't know stupid Malaysian law. He wrote a letter to immigration saying I was up to ""criminal activities."" "
12,"Know the feeling^^ 
But there is a lot more underwear ads for me nowadays x)"
13,"Sorry to read this happened to you. 

But don’t make the mistake of saying “5 years down the drain”.

Even if your relationship didn’t last, you have grown and learned more about yourself and about how relationships work as well.

Once you’ve processed the end of this relationship, you’ll be more ready for the next one. But don’t worry about that next one yet, take the time to let the waves die down first...

All the best man, take care..."
14,I love you. 
15,"Would you be ok watching him try dating women, while being his friend?!

Well, fuck that. I don't know about you, but I'd run..."
16,How old are you?
17,"You won’t feel it now, you won’t think it now, but you’ll be fine again. 

Go to your Friends, not combined friends. Your friends and crash at their house. Give yourself 2 - weeks or 3 weeks (depends how long your friends will have you) to be devastated, cry, negative and feel the hurt. No more. You can’t let it go on forever, and you can’t be that way forever.  The world carries on. This doesn’t mean you are going to feel normal on the Monday on week 3, but you have to scrape your ass off the couch, shave, get dressed and get moving again as difficult as it is. Don’t get stuck. 

You’ll be irrationally sad, you’ll be over emotional, it’ll take quite a while before you feel normal and a very long time before you trust someone again and that’s normal and understandable. But put one foot in front of the other and put back your world piece by piece and don’t seclude yourself away from the world around you. 

What does help is to Create and / or stick to your routines, there’s a lot of change and a lot of upheaval coming. Divorce, separating your stuff out, moving, a new home and starting fresh. The routines like waking up at the same time, making breakfast, going to the gym, going to work, coming home, going for a run, having dinner, then spending time reading, then bed, then rinse and repeat helps lay down new boundaries and normal. It lets you Autopilot. If you find you go stir crazy, or being alone makes you sad then spend as much time with friends and family (loved ones and people who care about you). "
18,Wow so your dad can request your passport be blocked even though u r older than 18?
19,"Considering that you posted on this side of Reddit, as a Malaysian myself, I really suggest you start detaching yourself from your family bit by bit.

I don't mean this in a ""fuck your family"" kind of way. I mean this in a ""you need to start looking at the possibility that your family will never accept you for who you are, therefore it's high time you start being independent.""

You don't need to do anything drastic. Just look into yourself and ask yourself what do you want later in life, and work towards it slowly - without any expectations that your family will be supportive of you in any way. It sounds very harsh but considering how your parents behaved in such a toxic manner, it seems like it's going to be necessity for you.

As for Netherlands, I know it's devestating now I'm sure you'll go in the future. Look into getting all your refunds back ASAP. You still have a long way ahead of you since you're just in your 20s. You have time on your side. Plan ahead and use it wisely.

I'm sorry for your loss. All the best!"
20,This is me exactly. I have asked my BF to do the exact same thing. A heavy musky scent is the fastest way to get me from zero to horny as fuck.
21,"My first boyfriend and I got walked in on my his mom.  Neither of us were out at that point, and it pretty much ruined the relationship. We were in HS at the time, so very naive.

Is what it is I suppose ..."
22,"Same deal, except we were in the 69 position with me on top. In walks his brother who looked 20ish and he is looking down staring at his phone as he's walking and talking as though my bf (his brother) could hear him over the deafening sound of Christina Aguilera blasting on the stereo to cover sexy noises.

Bf doesn't notice because he's facedeep in my ass, I am locked in paralyzing anxiety. Suddenly my bf pulls his head back and kinda lovingly slaps my ass(hole) and it makes a smacking sound (smack smack smack smack).

*This* is what makes bf's brother look up from near the doorway from his phone and instead of going away he just stands there like a scared little perv. Meanwhile, I'm laying on top of his older brother like a cat with its ass in the air as his brother is spitting on my asshole and so I just start pinching my boyfriends leg really hard to get him to OPEN HIS FUCKING EYES.

He does, he is up and off the bed in like a half second after tossing me like a blanket, dick-a-swingin in the breeze, physically pushing his brother out. 

Then had to do the walk of shame through his house AND he wanted me to meet his family. 

Wtf. 

Still makes me cringe."
23,"Hey man. First just wanted to say I’m proud that you’ve come out of this seemingly stronger and better.

I had a rough childhood. Dealing with parents struggling with alcoholism, addiction, mental health issues (mom has attempted suicide, and I found her), dealing with abuse as a kid, etc. has made life tough for sure. When it comes to dating, I’ll usually say I’ve been through a lot and won’t open up until I feel ready (being ready and not forced is so important). I never dealt with sexual abuse though, so that adds a layer for-sure. 

I would recommend just being honest with who you date initially (not the details, but just say you’ve been through a lot that has made you hesitant to date). If you find a good guy, he will accept that and accept you...

Best of luck man"
24,"This sounds fake, but if it isn’t courtesy would be to let your hook up know instead of surprising him. "
25,You’re the mom every gay person should have
26,This is the sexiest thing to me. I’d rather take a glimpse as the waist band compared to seeing a penis or butt!!!
27,"Incoming post on AGB: *I found the courage to say ""you're cute"" to a guy on the bus. He ignored me…*"
28,GRATZ!
29,"I am an old man now.  I have spent my whole life in three long term relationships.  I am of mixed race, Native American, and Celt.  Built like an NFL linebacker.  Average as far as pretty goes, but big and strong, and fit.  A career military man, a martial artist, and looking the part.  I have spent over forty years in two relationships with petite slender Asian men.  They were very twink, but very fit.  Ripped like Bruce Lee.  Both of them martial artists as well.

We have taken a lot of crap from all sides because we are so different.  People have given my two Asian lovers grief over supposed ""low self esteem"".  They have been told they should only date other Asians, and that their attraction to a big white guy is due to inferiority feelings.  Granted they are both GQ beautiful, and I am not, but that doesn't mean they have low self esteem.  They just like the corn fed American football player build.  For my part, their graceful, slender, cat like grace and agility sends me to the moon.  

I spent 16 years with my first lover, and my current lover and I are over twenty and going strong.  Yet folks still accuse me of having an Asian fetish.  For some weird reason folks want lovers to be the same.  My lovers and I are only attracted to those who are different.  I see that trait even in my friendships, and in my taste of movies and stories.  I am always attracted to what is different, and looking for windows into other worlds.

People don't stay together unless they are getting vital needs met.  That is just how humans operate.  Whether it is mixed generations, or mixed races, or mixed cultures---if two humans stay together the mix is working for them.  Others should just butt out of what doesn't concern them.  In an often harsh and ugly world I am gratified when I see any successful loving in the people around me."
30,"Just get to know him. At the least you have a new gay friend. If you're not really into him, I wouldn't advise getting into a relationship, however"
31,"Reads like a love story, good luck to you both!!"
32,"they don't have wasting police time laws in Malaysia?

&amp;#x200B;"
33,He should have eaten you out until you came that's just the courteous thing to do.
34,"&gt;We don’t think you’re a piece a shit.

Lol, the bar is set low there. I would go even further to say we think you’re great, OP."
35,"Remember that time when Jesus said, ""Hey Faggot!?"" 

No?   

Me, neither."
36,This is honestly so tame that it's hardly even kink. There are pheromones in the sweat that we are turned on by. It's less of a kink and more of a normal biological reaction. 
37,That was fun to read. I’m glad people still share light stories like this. Don’t mind the downvoters.
38,"The gay agenda does it again, folks. 

All jokes aside, glad to hear you’re happy!"
39,"You: don’t build a future into every exchange
Me: damn that is so astute - bet he’s handsome and neat, too - can’t wait to move to Paris w him"
40,"What you’re doing here is that extra step little gay children like myself desperately needed from our parents. An attempt at understanding. 

I kinda teared up reading your post because of things I’m going through with my mom, but seriously, thank you for making this effort for your child. "
41,"Post gym sex is fun! Buuuut after that, yeah, sorry, I am  showering. I don't like to fester in my own filth.... "
42,It's honestly concerning that people can dedicate so much of their time to caring about the asthetic nature of other people's dicks.
43,Malaysia literally has Sharia police so I wouldn't be optimistic about their justice system . . .
44,Thanks. I love you back :)
45,This shit’s gossip girl level juicy 
46,"I don't think you are a piece of shit. I think you are a wonderful person growing into a good man. You don't need his approval to love yourself, nor should you give him the power he attempts to usurp. 

Forget him...you are a good dude and it's Christmas Bro!!!!"
47,"Oh this is so sweet! As someone who had a long term long distance relationship with someone in Melbourne (I’m in Sydney as well), some things that worked for us were having lowkey hangouts, like syncing up Netflix and chatting to each other while we watched, or sharing music that we were enjoying and listening to it together. I guess my main advice is to find easy ways to share the things in your life that bring you joy. Good luck! I hope you two find happiness (and that February comes soon haha)"
48,"When i was in my 20s it somehow came up that I was gay at a halloween party. This one girl was absolutely fascinated with it in the worst way. At first she offered sex. She told me she would sleep with me out of the kindness of her heart and let me see what I was ""missing out on"". I tried to keep the peace with a slight chuckle and a no thank you but it sort of pissed her off. She ended up telling several women that I wanted to fuck their boyfriends and that I was a creep. Every guy in the party stared at me with venom. I remember a few of them would make moaning sounds if I came anywhere near them. Eventually when I couldn't take it anymore I decided to just walk home. Once or twice a car full of angry drunkass frat guys would drive up to shout bullshit at me and drive off.

The friend who'd invited me was also under the impression I wanted to steal her boyfriend. She refused to talk to me when I tried to explain. Shitty friends all around"
49,"&gt; Even though we’re in our 20s and you should be experienced by now.

Ouch."
50,"Congratulations, that is an amazing accomplishment on its own,  even more so given your circumstances.  
 
"
51,"There can only be 1 supreme, obviously, and you won."
52,People have sex. The guy should be mature enough to realize it. If he makes a big deal out of it that's on him. You don't owe him an explanation. All you can do now is work through your feelings and thoughts after the incident.
53,Happens when I look at my boyfriend still sometimes. I’m so lucky.
54,People are assholes.
55,He was embarrassed about his premature ejaculation. Leave him be and suck it up.
56,"I met this guy on a gay forum back in 2015. He texted me, saying he liked my posts. We exchanged messages back and forth. But both of us don’t think anything will come of it. He’s in Europe and I am in Australia.

Both of us met people in our lives but stayed in contact. We both grew fond of each other. But one day, we confessed that we actually like each other, far too much. So I asked him, come and meet me in Australia (he said he always wanted to come). He took the leap of faith.
 
Now, almost 2 years together. He is now sitting next to me in his family home.

TLDR: If you think he is worth it, go for it. Fight for it. Love fearlessly. "
57,I think I need to get tested by just reading this post
58,"Your dad is a dick. I just can't imagine a father seeing his son on the street and calling him a POS.

I'm a dad. I can be your dad.

You're doing great, son. I'm proud of you and I love you."
59,Tell him to stop projecting his own insecurities onto you.
60,"If so, I'm learning how from you guys. Everybody I've talked to here has given me really great advice and perspectives I hadn't thought of. Thanks for letting me hang out here."
61,"I know I have been trying to live independently, such as living in rented rooms on my own, buying my own clothes, etc. But I guess it was a mistake to go to them during my semester break. Devastating, really. One slip-up and they just destroy my life. It's an uncomfortable situation and to make matters worse, they will not admit they are in the wrong. 

My parents are definitely toxic and I'm looking forward to being completely independent next year. At this point, it's not worth it to get their help (internet plan, etc) because everything comes at a hefty hidden price.

If you ever wanna hang out on the weekends or something, hit me up, I'm always going back and forth Perak and Selangor. "
62,That made my day
63,"There should be a filter for ""Guys who have sort of OK social skills who want to meet guys so they don't feel so lonely but it may or may not lead to hooking up but probably not."" "
64,Hey man! Glad you could overcome bro! Happy for yalls friendship.
65,"Damn brutal, but I wouldn’t lose sleep over it. If he wants to be a little bitch and act like a child then let him. You’re all adults so don’t be ashamed of doing adult things."
66,"Mine hasn't said a word to me since he found out. 

You're not alone.  "
67,"Well done bro, I kept my secret for 22 years until a close friend leaked it. I've come to realise I literally don't care. "
68,"Text him.  Say you are flattered and want to hang out over a coffee, coffee usually says “We’re not going to fuck when we first meet”.  Meeting for a drink says, “I’ll fuck you maybe if I’m drunk enough.”  Meeting to watch Netflix definitely means oral sex and possibly toys.  "
69,"Yes, just act regular, introductions, smiles and casually sit down 😂"
70,Not everyone has their first time at 15. (I'm talking to OP)
71,"As a bi man, I wouldn't expect any guy, gay or bi, to just wait around while I go off and be with women. That is having your cake and eating it to. Fuck that. "
72,"I like being able to cover someone fully while doing doggy style, or being able to pick a guy up physically during sex, which is easier with shorter guys, generally."
73,"Am Malaysia. 

We have a special Muslim squad that go around hotels and catch Muslims having unwed sex"
74,"I didn't do any experiments or what not, but when I first joined Tinder I avoided saying generic things like ""hey how's it going"" because I thought it was a bad thing. I always tried to mention something from their pictures or start with something clever. That strategy did not start many conversations. Then I got annoyed so I took a break from Tinder for a couple months. Once I was back on, I just went for the ""hey how's it going"" since everyone else was doing it. Interestingly, people responded way more (albeit still not at a high frequency). Lastly, now I kind of just say ""sup"" and I think people respond to that more than anything else. Conversations don't last long though.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never tried it, but I am inclined to believe that you are right. I don't really want to hook up with a stranger though, so it's a little annoying that's what people mostly respond to. I wish there was a way to filter them out if that's not your goal, so that its not so tiring."
75,"Missing somebody? CALL

Wanna meet up? INVITE

Wanna be understood? EXPLAIN

76,You have big dick energy
77,"I do exactly what you do but I don’t emphasize it like I’m correcting it. I act almost like I didn’t even notice they used the wrong pronoun, I just respond using the right one. Usually works with minimum embarrassment for everyone involved."
78,"I dunno, the British Broadcast Company is pretty gay..."
79,Only 2 hours and 15 mins? Short party...
80,"&gt;submissive top

""Submissive top"" is the term for a submissive top. "
81,Go on...
82,"It sucks to befriend girls. I really like women and my closest friends are women, but when I meet girls on parties or during work, they usually mistake my interest in them as romantic or sexual interest and seem to feel a bit intimidated. So I tend to briefly mention during the first conversation that I'm only into guys, but that can get really annoying as I don't particularly like to talk about my love life. 

&amp;#x200B;

And it's even harder to befriend gay guys because they usually don't notice me as one of them."
83,"Baking, yes. Gardening, not as much anymore. I grew tomatoes, Roses, and Tulips for quite some time until recently."
84,"As a server, I once snuck my number under a guy's elbow while I was passing his table. Then I found out he was there with his dad...yikes.

88,"Because there’s not a lot of evidence or records of historical people’s personal lives, outside of things like marriages, kids, and major tragedies. Speculation about “obviously gay” historical figures - even if true - would be as substantiated as tabloid journalism. "
89,You can’t see the aesthetic when it’s in your asshole.

91,Kinda waiting for a follow up where the roommate wants to start to hang out with you all of a sudden....
92,"Dude, I feel so sorry for your situation. At least you're extremely lucky to have a supportive friend. And fuck your dad. "
93,"Wow.  I had to re-read this sentence:  ""My guess is the same amount considering he won't let his 20 year old son **who's living away from home** watch R movies....""

When that 20 year old finally rebels and breaks free, that should be a sight to behold."
94,"On one hand I feel like this is made up because this isn't how most of the guys I talk to on dating apps responded, my conversations are not nearly as sex driven as your experiences

but then again I only talk to guys 30 and above

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand I think I will never understand the deep obsession of dick pics or hookups or just the appeal of having sex with completely strangers in general for the mass majority of gay men. I've once had a guy that's 40 miles away from me and he drove for 2 hours to my place just to have sex, I don't know whether I should be flattered or concerned, but I did treat him well and took him out to dinner afterwards."
95,I upvoted halfway through but then I read the rest and I had to take it away. 
96,"Honestly scent is such a powerful part of our deepest brain structure and emotional triggers that I think you could even figure out someone’s sexual orientation just based on which scent turns you on, male or female. 

Some guys like “raunch” or “filth” or whatever, and that does nothing at all for me. Less than zero. It’s a turn off. 

But no guy stinks after a work-out, it takes hours and hours for anything rancid to kick in and I would definitely want him to shower eventually. 

But you put a freshly-showered guy in clean gym clothes and let him work out for an hour, if you are remotely sexually compatible, his shirt is going to smell awesome. At least it does to me. "
97,"I'm not allowed to be around my nieces and nephews with my husband because we are gay and my siblings don't want their children to respect a homosexual. (Highly religious Mormons)
It's to the point that if we even end up in the same place on accident they either leave or ask us to leave.

Somehow my parents don't seem to care. So I've chosen my husband over them and rarely see my family anymore, which they all say hurts them. But they also aren't willing to change any stances so here we are. "
98,"To be fair, there’s a lot of uncut-shaming too. "
99,SFTU I'm so tired of muslim apologists. If they're a backwards muslim gay hating country get your head out of your ass and get back in the game with the rest of us. They're our enemies. They hate us. There is no debate about it. There is no 'islamophobia'. Our ire is self-preservation. I don't want to hear this apologist crap on this sub anymore.
100,"I am leaving him be and I am sucking it up, I’m just venting :-("
101,I like to *get* baked. Not much of a cook :(
102,"This happened to me 37 years ago, with my husband.  Do not hold back.  "
103,"His mom made me sleep out on the couch.  We had slept over each other's houses for years, since like elementary school. I overheard his mom and dad discussing whether or not to tell my parents.  Luckily the didn't, but they did tell his older sister, who was like ""I know what you did last night "" in a real menacing tone to me the next day.

He was so embarrassed or maybe his parents said he could no longer see me or be friends and we stopped hanging out.  He wouldn't even make eye contact with me at school. It sucked, but he turned out to be a real airhead so I think I ended up dodging a bullet haha."
104,"I work out at home and am toned. 

I don't eat wheat products, or I barely eat them, I eat cake and snacks but not bread, pasta and rice(I just don't like it) and I know that's why I'm low body fat. 

You have to eat .8 - 1.2 grams of protein per pound of body weight if you want to gain muscle.

I'm 160 lbs, eat around 100-120 grams of protein a day. 

Top foods for me are 

Oranges and kiwis for fruits ; high protein

I eat mozzarella as a snack a lot with olives or tomatoes, mozzarella has a ridiculous amount of protein in it, you can get half your daily value in a snack(50 grams for me). 

I eat yogurt every day. 

I eat a lot of fried chicken and beef. 

I always have peanut butter in the house in case I didn't get enough protein I'll just eat a bunch of it. 

I eat seeds and nuts often. 

I also eat spinach / green peas daily cause they're high in protein. 

Literally I work out while watching TV or waiting for my food to cook, it's random, and I'm pretty toned. 

I really don't make sure to eat non-fatty foods, I just avoid wheat in general and that seems to keep me slim, bread is FULL of carbs it's like eating sugar. Fat itself really isn't that bad for you.  

I don't recommend protein shakes, it's better to get a high protein diet through normal food because you absorb it better and get a variety of nutrients. Just learn what foods have high protein and start eating them. 

About 10-15 grams of my protein comes from fruits and vegetables a day

Another 10-15 from nuts / seds

20-40 from dairy

40-50 from meat. 

I'm late 20's and still ""teenage"" slim almost or like right before the college fat hits you slim, and it's 100% because I don't eat a lot of wheat. Doesn't mean you can't have it, just don't have a lot of it, or eat it in every meal. You can actually eat a lot of fat if you don't eat wheat, I cover my vegetables in butter, like over the daily values worth of fat in butter every day . 

*Also edit, this sounds crazy but seeds, especially pumpkin seeds make you feel AMAZING.

I mean fucking amazing, pasta and bread makes you feel like shit. Pumpkin seeds are literally like doing a drug, honestly go buy some, eat half a cup of them, wait 30 minutes, and you'll feel like you took a Xanax almost lol.

Not even an exaggeration, pumpkin seeds and seeds in general make you feel so good, they get rid of anxiety, it's actually insane how well they work for me.  Everyone should try getting seeds in their diet, it's definitely something humans have been eating since the beginning considering how good it makes you feel. "

106,That's a beautiful story. Don't be afraid of enjoying these moments together. You're fortunate to experience these feelings. 
107,"The one thing I can say is that hooking up with randoms will not fill the hole that he left. If you want to go out and have sex there’s nothing wrong with that, but the only thing that will heal you is time and a good support system of family/friends."
108,"I can't imagine being married to a guy and still using condoms. 

If you were my husband, wanting to keep using condoms at this point would signal to me that you don't trust me. 

Getting tested when monogamous should be maybe just something you do at the yearly check-up or as a ""while I'm here""  thing if you have to go to the doctor for something else. Personally that would also signal that you don't trust me, but it's not as big a deal as using rubbers every single time we have sex. "

122,That's a real simple mistake no big deal honestly. 
123,"You have to remember one thing through this: you are the most important person here.

You like him a lot, that's obvious, and it is all too easy to brush off red flags no matter how much you may look back at the past and think ""holy fuck that was a shining, blaring, giant red flag"". And the fact he thinks he might be ""better with women"" brings up so many. Most prominently is that means he probably has some internalized homophobia, and that, unfortunately, he isn't happy or satisfied being with you. It hurts, but it's the truth. If he's expressed desire to be with another person, male or female, and has gone so far as to suggest you two break up so he can date them instead, that means he is not happy with you. That hurts, but you know what?

You deserve better.

You deserve so much better than that.

You deserve someone who actually wants to be with you, not someone who suggests he could be ""better with a woman"", which, mind, is no different than saying ""better with someone else"".

And because of that, I say go to him and tell him to his face ""After thinking about what you said about you dating women instead of me, I am no longer happy in this relationship. I deserve a guy who wants me, and your suggestion to break up so you can see if you would like a different person more than me is insulting and disrespectful to me. So, go and find the person you actually want to be with, and I'll find the person who actually wants to be with me."" And I do mean it to be that harsh. He has said to your face that he wants to date other people more than he wants to keep dating you, and you deserve more respect than that.

Coping will be hard, but you need to take that giant red flag and tear the bandage off now. You will find a guy who genuinely wants you for you. You will find a guy who would be ashamed you would ever think it would be okay for him to value you so little as to suggest he could be happier with someone else."
124,"I’m kind of obnoxious when it comes to showering.  I absolutely love them and easily could shower 3+ times a day if it weren’t wasteful and unnecessary.  

And I don’t mind sweating at all — in fact, I love an intense workout/sweat session.  But the second I’m done, I have to shower.  Being sweaty/dirty physically makes me feel like shit.  I feel bad for any potential bf who’s into that type of thing then 😕"

151,"When my family threw me on the street for being gay it was a pack of Jesus freak hippies that took me in, and who insisted I not drop out of school.  It was those Christians who insisted that God did not make scrap metal.

When I went off into the military I had the great good fortune to fall in with a whole spread of older gay Christian men.  They adopted me out of the goodness of their heart, and raised the half savage little barbarian I was into a half way decent human being.  They took me under their wing, and taught me how to survive and prosper back when they were taking us gays off to prison.

When I met and fell in love with my first long term lover, his parents, both Methodist ministers, owned me utterly, and presented me to their world as their other son.  They were the only real parents I ever had.  When they were incapacitated latter, they asked my partner and I to take in and raise his two much younger brothers.

There are wonderful Christians, and dreadful bigots.  There are wonderful atheists, and dreadful bigots in that camp too.  There are wonderful pagans and Wiccans, and there are violent ones who conduct dreadful sacrifices.  You can get on with any background if they are genuine, and loving, and responsive."

Maybe you could over look some of this, but when someone's Grindr profile says they're looking for a relationship (when they're in a relationship) it's a huge red flag.

You're lucky to have what sounds like such an amazing friend. I hope your relationship with your family improves or you're able to gain more independence. I don't really know the point of this comment. I'm just in an emotional place right now and I want you to know that everyone here has your back and I really hope you feel better soon.

If you are coming home and feeling like you want to cry over the stress from a job or the way people at work make you feel, then it’s time to look for something else.  

I wouldn’t come out to these jackasses, they are not your friends and I can guarantee that they do not care about you.  They may be “nice” at times, but ultimately, they don’t have your best interest in mind. I think coming out will only make your situation worse, not better.  

Just my 2 cents.. "
188,"Straight women have a different experience I think, let me break it down.


**Straight women:**

- *You are the controller of the good that’s in demand.* 

A girl is always going to have a selection of men to choose from without much effort, whilst a straight man  is going to have to be “competitive” 99% of the time.

- *Women tend to seek casual sex less than men.* 

Which means that they also don’t care if they decide to just have no sex or stay single. Guys are the ones always desperate to get their nut, which means that the women have control in this “exchange”. 

**Gay men:** 

- *You don’t have any specific power over potential sexual partners.* 

I don’t care if you look like a donkey’s asshole, there is some gay dude out there willing to get fucked by you. 

- *Hell, most “ugly attributes” are considered sexy attributes for a wide variety of gay dudes.* 

A lot of gays are into chubbier, hairier men, a lot of gays are into anorexic looking twinks, a lot of men are into older guys, a lot of men are into exclusively 18 year olds. There is a ton of variety in the gay community, and everyone can be loved for something that would be a major negative in the straight dating game.

Can't remember what it was, but I over-heard this one girl stating to a couple of the guys to not eat my food cause you'll probably catch AIDs.  (This was 3 years prior to being tested positive in 1988.)  I went to my boss and told her that either she fired that girl or I would quit.

208,"I fell in love with my best friend too in college. I came out to him and he was very accepting and kind. He even claimed he always kinda knew. After a while he started being more sweet, calling me wifey at times and being an utmost gentleman. Of course, my fragile heart fell. Then he had a girlfriend. It was like a slap in my face. I was angry, blamed him for my misery because he lead me on. I avoided him like a plague and eventually he gave up reaching out. He messaged me saying how hurt and angry he is that I won't give him any explanation. 

That was many years ago. I regret letting our friendship crumble. I've always convinced myself that it was him who ruined it, for making me feel special after knowing that I had a tendency to feel more. Nowadays, I just wonder if I've misread the signs, if I'm really the one who ruined our friendship for expecting more. Still, I knew that if I stayed friends with him during that time it would break me. It hurt when I see him with his girlfriend and he spent less more time with me.

223,"Hi Dave,welcome to the gay.

A representative will be mailing you the gay agenda shortly. No need to come out to your family to receive it!

Enjoy your homosexuality :)"
224,"My husband came out at 37.  He waited until we were dating to come out.  The only down side to him waiting (from my point of view) was that he came out to his family and then just a few months later told them we were engaged.  I think they were still adjusting to him being gay and then had to absorb that they’d have a new son/brother-in-law.   It wasn’t really a problem exactly, they are very liberal and accepting people, but there was some adjusting to the idea and they were a little uptight at first.

I will say that it was important to me that he come out because I didn’t want to lie to people about our relationship.  Living together and pretending to be the roommate or something would not have worked for me.  It wasn’t an issue though - he was ready to come out and took care of it.  

It worked out - 14 years in, two kids, doing well.  His mom loves being a grandma and his sister loves being an aunt.   I doubt they really think about us as any different from any other couple.  "
225,"Y'all are so cute! Also hugs, I love being the taller one because I feel protective and stuff. "
226,"My brother came out years after me, I knew he was gay at a young age but my mum wouldn't have it.

My mum also wanted me to be straight initially when I came out asking about girls I liked at school. I came out at 13 ( in 1993) I was bullied badly at school getting into fights and daily verbal abuse so I think my treatment put my brother further back into the closet.

We aren't twins however I feel your frustration, maybe try and talk to him about it. It's different now because your generation has the Internet to reach out and talk to other guys about what's going on so you don't have the isolation factor I had growing up.

Me and my brother weren't close, I even remember seeing him at. A gay club and he ran away from me in the club so between us there was no open dialogue. 

If you can't speak to him about it then you just have to get on with your life and not worry about his or your mum's feelings and actions.  Regardless of how your mum feels about it she can't live either of your lives for you.  She ain't gonna stop your brother from Coming out.  It sucks that there still is a pressure on us to be a certain way out of some parents expectations but that's just society today but people's thoughts are  slowly changing . 

The grindr thing is also annoying but again but unavoidable if your brother is using it . I don't think it's fair of you  ask him stop stop using it but at the same time you must feel like he's moving in on a space that's yours.  

My brother is a bit of a prude and isn't on grindr but it crosses my mind that I may have spoke to or sent pics to friends of his. But hey what ya gonna do? I gotta live my life. If I thought about what he and other thinks I'd not do anything for fear of what others think. 

I feel for ya man it's a tricky situation but you gotta ride this one out. Do you, be you and just know that one day it will all figure itself out.

241,Then why did you get married....
242,"Armchair history hypothesis: for most of history in the West gay men weren't allowed to have relationships, period. So we grow up not seeing them, being isolated from society and not believing ourselves worthy of love. Now gay relationships are slowly gaining representation, but that doesn't apply to adults. Add in modern hookup culture and how easy it is to get casual sex, and you end up with most gay men not having healthy relationships or attitudes towards sex. *The Velvet Rage* by Alan Downs is a little old, but it discusses many of these concepts and the pyschology behind them, as well as offering a better perspective on gay dating. Highly recommend it. "

""Oh really?"" 
""Oh yeah, He has a CADC-1 credential, and has been working for non profit XYZ bringing relief to addiction at risk populations ever since we first met.""

I gloss right over the top of it. People catch up, and they appreciate your flexibility in accepting that it is fine for them to make a common mistake. If they ask for an explanation I give it to them, but nine times out of ten, they catch on quick enough without all that extra emphasis or coaching. "
244,"Some people like to give one person a coffee enema, drink it out of their ass with a rubber hose, gargle it and then spit it back into the asshole before viciously fucking it with a turkey baster full of cream gravy."
245,where is lube in this story?
246,"the first time I was asked out by a waiter, I made a joke when he said “God I could really go for a fag right now” and I said “Well I’m right here” and he laughed and asked for my number lmao "
247,"Yeah, imagine actually waiting till you’re 15 to have sex..."
248,Pics or it didn't happen 
249,"Haha, sometimes when I’m struggling, the reaction from the top would be A) a giggle or B), they’d do this cute thing where they take it off for me. "
250,How did the guy you were hooking up with react? Was he cool about it or awkward?
251,"The bringing a person home rule should apply equally to all. Regardless of sexuality.

If your roommates (assuming male) can bring home females then you should be able to bring home guys.

Obviously follow common courtesy stay out of shared spaces, thier rooms, don't keep them up.  Make sure the guy you are bringing back is going to be trustworthy.

It's a discussion you need to have regardless of being gay or straight.

252,I thought it was in FuckOffMormons chapter 6 verse 9? Guess not
253,Rapid onset homosexuality... I've heard of a few cases before
254,"Went through something similar. Not married, but 5 1/2 years and then he had found himself a new dude that he cheated with and then actually got engaged to. 

Be sad. Get a routine. Stick to taking care of YOU right now. Cut him out. Don’t check his social media posts. Don’t answer his texts. Do not let him define your happiness. "
255,"I'm an atheist and I just think I would have a very different worldview than a 'devout' Christian.  Religion has done far more damage than good in this world in my opinion.

Not sure why I would get downvoted for answering your question. "
256,I wouldn't think twice about it.  This doesn't seem the least bit strange. They're using their mouth to get you off after all... 
257,"To any guy that doesn't like being rimmed but let it happen anyways:

&amp;#x200B;

You don't need to fake moans, the person already enjoys it a lot by eating you out. Thank you for being tolerant."
258,"As long as he's 18 or older, I don't see the issue.

Get him, boo. "
259,"I don't think anyone was acting like a ""little bitch"". If my roommate was fucking someone I would have done the same thing, just don't say anything and back out. 

The actual adult thing was for the other guy to let his roommate know ahead of time not to come into the room. In addition, actually for the OP and his hookup to communicate with each other after the incident and apologize for leaving/getting out of the mood. 

Also, like you said, people do adult things. OP shouldn't let this get to him too much, it happens. But just be careful doing those activities in the MC (gay, straight or whatever else) in accessible areas. "
260,Thank you for your insight. 
261,Ultimate form of masturbation
262,"Just don't have unprotected sex. Seriously. Sex parties are fun, but also a great way to catch something. "
263,Don't shit where you eat...
264,You've never had alcohol but your already going to a sex party? I don't know why I find this hilarious. 
265,"Mom 2 minutes before I come out : ""tell me anything . Even if you commited murder, I am your mom !""

Mom 2 minutes after I come out: ""I retract what I said ....)

Mom 1 day after I come out : ""I think we can no longer be in touch with each other....""


Honesty just doesn't work with some (conservative) people ."
266,"r/creativewriting 

4/10 at best. Do some research on irl cruising before writing your next erotic short story. "
267,"I'm a somewhat chubby guy. My boyfriend-ish is a total twunk. I mean, he's been told to be a model many times. 

I hear people talking about 'why is *he* with that fat guy?' A lot when we're out, and I hate it. I hate that he gets crap for people thinking he's selling himself short. I hate that this is a facet of the gay community. We (the community as a whole) pretend to be accepting and a lot of the time, we're not. 

Anyways, thanks for listening, internet. "
268,Is your mom having a hard time accepting it? Forgive me if I'm overstepping a boundary by asking - I just wondered because of how you said that. Are you okay?
269,"I feel you. I’m the shy, down to earth, Netflix and ch...more Netlix, kind of gay. I dont even enjoy anal sex all that much. I feel like an alien against all the Insta hotties I see strutting around. It feels like Gay Culture is telling me that if I’m not a ripped, ultra confident supermodel with 10,000 followers and partners lining out the door I shouldnt even bother. Thankfully I have a boyfriend who’s just as laid back and outside the “scene” as I am, and Im forever grateful. "
270,"This kind of ignorance makes sense. You cant dismiss adolescent trauma easily.

The best and possibly only way to cure this is more experience. He needs to know that there are wonderful transwomen out there. Ones who would never bully someone. You cant talk this out of him, he has to meet them himself. "
271,Oh you nasty.
272,Like a goddamn fool
273,So are you indirectly telling me to fuck them?
274,He ordered a Shirley Temple.
