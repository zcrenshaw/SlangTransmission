Most of us grow up assuming we are straight because that's the norm of society, I know I was conflicted for a long time and only accepted I was bi at age 20. Just know that whatever you turn out to be: straight, gay, bi, or other, that there is nothing wrong with that. In regards to your relatives well there's no easy answer and I can't say I have sorted it out myself. I know keeping a secret like that can be a struggle, but ultimately whats most important is you feel safe and comfortable in your own home, and you certainly aren't required to tell your parents, grandparents or anyone for that matter.  Feel free to ask me anything or just chat. 

Also know that bi specific spaces like r/bisexual exist. 


Edit: For anyone just seeing the top comment I wanted to add in that another commenter was right to recommend r/lgbteens
"
1,"1) Keep it away from bright light

2) Don't get any water on it

3) Never, never ever feed it after midnight"
2,A lot of guys dont like to eat too much if they think sex is a possibility
3,"That's so cute. I'll upvote you, so someone can help you.

#tl;dr This guy is looking for a bi guy to relate to"
4,"Looking back, If I Knew what gay was at 7, I would say I would have known.  I remember not caring about the cute girls in my class.  But I do remember looking at certain guys and thinking they were cute.

I am glad you are supportive of it if he is indeed gay, but I think it is a mistake to keep asking him or trying to push him into discussing it.  If he is not ready to talk about, or he feels bad about, pushing him into talking about will only make him more uncomfortable.

Instead, keep being loving and supportive.  Instead of asking him about girls or boys or who he might like, keep conversations gender neutral. Remind him what you said above that you will love him not matter what.  When he is ready to talk about you can have that conversation.   "
5,"""if I can prevent my son from being Gay, I will""...

Well, You Can't, So You Won't."

7,"I’m verse. So had it both ways. And assuming we are saying BOYFRIEND. I’m also assuming you have made your bottom cum already or simultaneously while you came. 

First, don’t rush to pull out. Ask if you should pull out? If he wants it, move to a spooning position if you are not already. I love the feeling of being ‘full’. Falling asleep post orgasm in a spoon position. I’ve also had a lot of boyfriends ask me to do this. 

Whisper in his ear how much you love him. How good it felt. What about him turns you on and why. 

Another option, with or with out #1, reach around front and cup his junk. Some ‘sub’ guys want to feel safe. Cupping their junk is very intimate and relaxing. 

One boyfriend was great. He would pull out. Tell me to lie perfectly still. He would run and get some hot wet towel and clean me up. All the time giving me sweet kisses all over my body. A few times, kisses even on my sore hole he had just wrecked. But it showed how much he cared. That he appreciated me and the ‘gift’ and ‘intimacy’ I’d just shared with him. Then would lie down and caress me. 

The biggest thing is some intimacy. Being fucked is being probed and violated. Assuring and thanking your bottom ensures they will want to do it again. 

Also, very important. Do not make your bottom feel ashamed if they fart. It is very common after you have shoved a lot of air up in them. If you can, laugh and say it is YOUR fault. It is a sign of a good fuck session. 

Hot showers are good. 

Ordering room service and feeding them are good. 

If they have not cum, and you are versatile, slide them onto them and make them happy too. Flip fucking is the best! Can then make you hard again, and you might be fucking him again before you know it!"
8,"Thanks you have no idea how much this helps, just telling someone makes it easier I guess. I'll check out the subreddit, thanks again."
9,"If they’re bottoms, they like you.

If they’re tops, I’m not sure."
10,"Wow, people weren't kidding when they said the Oscars were having trouble finding someone without the potential to be a controversy landmine"
11,you're supposed to have sex first and *then* go out for dinner.

14,Just have Ellen do it every year tbh
15,He also said this on a Netflix special. It’s not just tweets from ten years ago. 
16,"Absolutely yes, I over analyze everything. This also creates an over drinking problem if I'm at a bar or something by myself, I get too nervous and don't consider how much I'm drinking"
17,"I do wonder how many relationships fail before they can develop into something permanent, because of preferences and labels"
18,"Once a week.

For half a year.

Just don't even bother responding. Like why... Or if you do respond then just brush it off and say ""yeah whatever"" or ""I don't care""."
19,"Lol I'm in a Muslim country and I do the same... let hot guys preach to me and try to reconvert me back into Islam as an overture to becoming closer to them. 

Allah this, Allah that, mhmm... while all this time I'm tracing a line from his bicep to his lips using my eyes. "
20,"Everytime I criticize the gays about this matter on other subs I literally get downvoted to oblivion

Edit: im just gonna spill the tea. By other subs I mean /r/rupaulsdragrace and /r/popheads"
21,"I was a Mormon missionary in Brazil, and I was on that end of the conversation you described more than once.  I behaved myself the whole two years, as do nearly all of them.  When I came home, I left the church and cane out of the closet.  I wasn’t the only closeted gay missionary.  "
22,A model level hot guy will look good with or without glasses. Not sure if that has the same effect on my face lol 
23,"But I murdered that ass.

I'll show myself out."
24,Sigh. I did this also much to the ire of my super religious and homophobic mother. 
25,Im the bottom usually 
26,"ok, absolutely off limits, you should look at your best friend's family as your own family..."
27,Interview with rolling Stone in 2015 on the matter did not help either. Guys a homophobe. People want to deny that like little children throwing tantrums but water is wet and Kevin Hart is a homophobe.
28,"Yea gays are just the second largest group for number of hate crimes in 2017 despite being an ""invisible minority"" and making up only 3% of the total population. Conservatives are...uh...the left disagrees with them and tries to prevent them from making life shittier for certain people! Won't anyone think of the poor conservative straight white males???!!!!!

edit: third, pardon me c:"
29,This. Being a bottom isn’t an easy life. 
30,"Reminds me of a line I heard once: “it’s not a ‘gay wedding,’ it’s just a ‘wedding.’”

I hope we as a society get there someday.... "
31,"insert your finger in his butt

if he said ""ugh"": he is gay; if he said ""ouch"": he is not"
32,your mother is a medical professional and that was her response?  she sounds charming.
33,I'm currently loving myself. Would someone care to lend a hand?
34,“I’m not racist but if I can avoid living next to black people I will” is the same sentiment. Saying “I’m not X” doesn’t make you not X.
35,"When he’s asleep wrap a bit of string or paper around his finger and mark the size, then take it to the jeweller to measure. Good luck!"
36,That story was fucking hilarious. I’ve had a few like that where I wanted it to become a regular thing so badly I put foot in mouth. I had one the other day where I couldn’t tell if a hug was wanted so we shook hands. Fucking shook hands. Jesus. 
37,I feel like you can be conservative in certain aspects (ex. economically) but still care about gay rights.
38,"It's gotten to the point where he has said it is negatively affecting him emotionally:

&gt;""In the back of my heart, I feel like I need to go be seen with someone -- like a girl -- in public, to prove to people that I'm not gay,"" he said. ""Even though in my heart I know that it's not a bad thing. There's still a piece of me that thinks that. And I hate that side of me.""

https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/27/entertainment/shawn-mendes-interview-gay/index.html

Gay people are literally making this guy who is basically still a kid feel insecure with his sexuality. If that isn't enough then something is wrong with you. This is something almost all of us should be familiar with and know how shitty it is."
39,"Keep talking - it DOES help.  Sometimes just getting your thoughts out and having someone acknowledge you is unbelievably therapeutic.  

It’s okay to be unsure about things.  It’s okay to have these feelings.  You don’t have to figure it all out right now.  

You be you and be proud of it.  Straight, bi, gay - that actually means very little.  What matters is that you allow yourself to be happy regardless of who you are attracted to.  Be happy because you are valid, you matter, and you are a human that deserves love and respect.  Don’t let who you are attracted to define you, because that is just one single trait - that isn’t all you are.

EDIT:  Be Safe!  If you are certain your parents will be supportive, please talk to them.  If not, don’t!  Your #1 priority is to ensure your safety and well being."
40,"I told my mom I had a crush on a boy at school in kindergarten so my mom always knew. Just let him figure it out on his own. Maybe mention how you support the LGBTQ community if it comes up on the news.

He’ll be just fine with your love and support. "
41,"I don't think you're wrong at all. He came to you for advice and you went freaking above and beyond. And whether you did help him or not, there is a good chance that he would've messed around anyways. I know for a good bit of gay gays that when we come out we start exploring lol. Now he is having safe sex thanks to you. Awesome man. "
42,"Maybe you're just so damn interesting, charming, and gorgeous that they forget to eat because they can't stop admiring you."
43,"Just roll with it. I did a 180° from being pretty homophobic to being pretty open to any kind of sexual activity with women, men, trans, etc. I like what I like. That is who I am; nothing wrong here. Do not think too much about a _definition/name_ for your sexuality; rather, start _experiencing_ your sexuality! "
44,Just start eating theirs
45,"its not the same :,( the tumblr blogs were way more personal and there were a ton more with more diversity. there were like at least 5 gay tumblrs dedicated to one very specific kink/fetish or body part"
46,"I think this is how being vers works for all of us. Like, sure, you are going to have a few people with whom you flip-fuck, but for the most part being vers means you change your position depending on the other person and your mood."
47,"I did this a few months ago. He called it a proper ""gay date"" . Learn something new everyday. Lol."
48,Agreed 
49,"I've been fooling around a lot with one of my bi friends recently. 

The first time I saw him naked I was honestly surprised that he didn't have a huge dick. That was my first thought. It's about 1 inch soft and 4.5 inches hard pressed to the bone.

Now I'm definitely no size queen. In fact I really prefer dicks around 5-6 inches over bigger ones.

But he's 6'2, about 185ish lbs and he's kinda cocky. Not really in an arrogant way but he's confident and sexy and he knows it.

He's bragged about how big his dick a bunch of times (and yea I know most guys have bragged/exaggerated about how big their dicks are). 

One time he challenged one of our friends who said he had a bigger dick and he was like, ""nah bro for real i'll whip it out right now lets go i'll prove it"" and it was funny af but it was a ballsy and believable bluff lmao

Mine isn't huge either but I'm quite a bit bigger (only 6.5 inches). He's a bit taller than me though so it also appears a bit smaller in proportion to his body.

I'm also friends with a girl he's hooked up with in the past and she said it was ""like 7 to 7 and a half inches"" LOL! She's a bit ditzy so I should've known.

But there's something really sexy about a guy with a smaller dick that just exudes confidence. He's the definition of big dick energy, albeit with a slightly smaller dick. 

Since I prefer smaller and average sized dicks over bigger ones, it was actually a really pleasant surprise lol"
50,"That's the problem with ""straight"" guys. They don't reciprocate because that's ""gay"". "
51,I think 90% of men feel really confident and sexy when they're wearing one. The other 10 just don't like wearing suits.
52,Which is why I felt this post was warranted 
53,probably yes. don't encourage him but don't discourage him either. give him some time to figure it out
54,Cuddle and kiss him for at least five minutes after. I fucking hate it when guys jump up and grab a towel right away like they need to clean up a crime scene.
55,Don’t be such a persnickety downdoody and just relax and enjoy them.
56,Show them. Shatter their world. Shatter it
57,"Funny, my boyfriend did similar to me."
58,"I would also add that because we are surrounded by a lot of straight role models, we don’t have a lot of positive gay role models. Having such people in your lives will help him figure out who he is. At the minimum watching as a family tv shows with healthy gay couples will help him realize that this is normal, that he is normal for (maybe) having those feelings, and that his family is accepting of those tv relationships. Don’t let him figure out who he is solely on the Internet, that place can be unhealthy."
59,"Look at mister social-outgoing, going at bars and shit. I drink alone in front of my computer like a normal social outcast"
60,I don't know who Sean Cody is. Does he do porn?
61,to determine the answer to this i conducted an a/b test by measuring my tendency to be self-critical while being gay and while being not gay
62,"It might be hard now but hang in there.  Within months of graduating, high school and the people you’re worrying about will literally never matter again. "
63,I would be getting ready for all the kisses I wasn’t getting. 
64,"&gt;""I'm not homophobic, I have nothing against gay people, do what you want to do, but me, being a heterosexual male, if I can prevent my son from being gay, I will""

I had a friend whose father thought like this. It ended with child abuse and regular beatings. And hint: It didn't change his gayness at all. Just made him depressed and suicidal. So fuck anyone who utters these words. "
65,"Oh, look! :O It's a once-in-a-lifetime post where @lazy\_summer\_god is wholesome! :O"
66,"I DEFINITELY AGREE.

Bonus points if the guys balls hang low enough/are big enough to make lewd sounds slapping against me when I bottom"
67," Literally me just now hahaha, I should add that they had THE nicest asses"
68,"As a lot of people have already said, cuddling after is definitely a win. My bf and i usually have a shower together as well afterwards. Plenty of hugs, kissing, and scrubbing eachother down. After all of that, my bf usually makes me a cuppa, and it feels like the best thing in the world."
69,this is the real circlejerk i came here for
70,Just start eating them. ftfy
71,"My ex used to wake me up on weekends by sucking my balls and nuzzling my cock with his face and mouth, sniffing my balls, taking deep breathes of my junk  until  a minute or so later...I was hard as a fucking rock, wide awake, and grinding his face. By then, I was pretty much ready to fuck his face or his ass, which is my favorite way of getting off. 

Serious turn on for me. Made me feel like he worshiped my junk. "
72,Uhm teach your kid to knock? tf? Youre not wrong for being in your own room wtf
73,"It doesn’t always have to be this big event. 

My bf Of 10 years and I were driving on the Belt Parkway leaving a friends wedding. I said to him “ what are we waiting for? I want to marry you, do you want to marry me?” And he said “ yes of course I do” so I said “ good. Let’s get married. “. We shook hands and drove home. It was perfect. We have been married 2 years and still love telling that story  

Do what feels right. Don’t over think it. "
74,"Muscle-memory from applying chapstick since age 11 actually put me ahead of the curve against my homorivals and has made me the elite, platinum-level cock-sucker I am today.

💁🏼‍♀️"
75,"Tip: if you wanna suck someone to wake them up, first jerk them off til they're hard then suck them.

 Otherwise, you run the risk of them peeing in your mouth (unless you're into that)"
76,I was your son when I was 7 and I can tell it is possible. He's lucky to have open minded parents. 
77,awww cute! i wish the best 
78,"She's the new Jay Leno/Billy Crystal. She's way too goddamned safe and bland. I say go with someone reliably funny, but not overwhelmingly divisive - someone like Martin Short, Stephen Colbert, Steve Martin, etc.

Or just get Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: You guys are naming some funny broads. I love the idea of a woman (or several) hosting the ceremony. But none of that ""ten hosts sharing the night"" nonsense like they had in the 1970's."
79,"People have been making jokes about how he's supposedly gay and a bottom since he was like 16 because he can be a bit effeminate despite him going on the record that he's straight.

https://www.them.us/story/shawn-mendes-is-heterosexual

It's coming up again cause of a story in *Rolling Stone*:

https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/shawn-mendes-cover-interview-756847/
"
80,Kevin Hart spend a good proportion profiting from homophobia. I don't believe an apology is good enough. 
81,"No, wait until he’s ready and he initiates the conversation.

Good on you for asking this sub though!"
82,I've wondered the same thing. I dated a lot of guys who just wanted boxes checked. Fit? Check. Professional? Check. etc. It taught me to patiently wait guys out to find out who were the ones interested in sticking around and which were secretly checking a list.
83,My first thought was “damn his chest hair looks sexy.” Shortly thereafter replaced by “god he’s just sexy all over”.
84,Yeah when someone does that I instantly stop talking to them completely 
85,Smack his ass then go beat him in Smash Bros.
86,Exactly I want her to accept me sooo fucking bad but its not worth it anymore 
87,I wish I had an S.O to know lmao
88,I don't think Mark is a bottom... I think he's a Muppet and doesn't have anything from the waist down.
89,"I disagree with the ads part. All I use Tumblr for is porn and there's definitely never been a shortage of ads. 

They get ads based on cookies, search history, linked email addresses etc. So while my Tumblr is filled with pictures of guys butts and hardcore gay sex, I'll get adds from Amazon and eBay all the time. I even had adds from Disney after looking up presents on their site. 

Pretty sure they'll be taking a hit on this one."
90,I had sex with a mormon on mission in my town. He said his family was okay that he was gay. They just believed that gay sex was sin and marriage wasn't something they could accept. He felt like he was luckier than most. That was an interesting summer. 
91,"woken up at 4 am? yes, I'd be super annoyed and grumpy.

woken up at 9 am? not at all."
92,"They will always be bigger hoes, specially in the gay community. I guess you are just a OK hoe."
93,"Your mom sounds like a bitch.... 

Yes, you will, it's fine - and common. "
94,"Glad to hear you’re living your true self, dude! "
95,"Hey bro, take it from someone who as a teenager was caught several times by family members with gay porn on his computer. It's extremely, painfully humiliating when they confront you about it, and it only drives you further into the closet. I'm 22 and I still cringe looking back at those times. Do not confront him.

My best advice would be to create a welcoming environment and demonstrate to your lil bro that you are accepting about gay stuff and will always love him no matter what he is. Mention casually something about how one of your friends or classmates came out as gay and how great that someone can do that in 2018 and still be so loved, accepted as if nothing ever changed, etc.. Or ask him if he's seeing or has a crush on someone, but only use gender neutral terms like ""person"" and ""they/their."" Catch my drift? 

People who are in the closet will literally pick up on anything and everything gay related, positive and negative, that comes out of the mouths of their loved ones. Get creative and drop those subtle hints... believe me, he'll pick up on them. Best of luck! "
96,"As someone who's worn glasses his entire life, this isn't really a thing. It's normally when you see a person without glasses wearing them out can become hot because it's a fashion accessory whereas with everyday people, You dont see them because it becomes a part of their face. Know what i mean?"
97,"There's nothing wrong with fantasizing, but you absolutely have to remember that a fantasy is just a fantasy.  


As I've told a bunch of dudes on this sub already, you have (presumably) done the work to come out.  The absolute minimum cost for any dude to be with you is for them to have done that, too.  The best way to walk around life is to just assume that every dude you encounter is straight and off limits unless they actually tell you otherwise.  Is that fair?  No.  But it's the reality of the world we have to live in.  Pursue a dude that at least has the potential to be into you.  


You can fantasize about your hot straight friend all day long.  Don't invest your heart into him, though."
98,"A great face can make up for a subpar body, but not vice versa (imho)."
99,It working out every time we fuck.
100,"Yes, all the time. 

Everybody else seems so witty and quick thinking and I always struggle to come up with appropriate responses. Also, everybody makes fun of me for being weird and socially awkward and saying things that don't make sense sometimes. 

It makes sense because I have Aspergers as well as psychological problems. "
101,Totally get it. Younger and sweet looking and my cock’s rock hard instantly. Mature and rugged looking and I’m salivating. 
102,I am able to donate *sigh*
103,"As a bottom, I still eat normally because I'm not compromising my health for the possibility to get fucked. Douching and planning are the solution for me."
104,are you seriously gonna be a lil bitch in front of an 11 year old?! show the little prick who's boss!
105,"He sets my gaydar off too, but I agree leave the poor kid alone. "
106,True. I have a friend who is socially liberal and economically conservative. He should be allowed to make his own choices in who he wants to represent him. Not every republican is socially Conservative. 
107,"He must be so insecure about it probably based on previous experiences, 

Call him and tell him straight up that you don't care and he must not hide it from you, it would be a good way of getting whatever goes on next between you and him on the right foot  (no pun intended) 

I had a similar thing with this extremely charming tall southern guy, but he just would not get naked because he had a small d, which I really diddnt care about, eventually we had a serious chat about it and he slowly started getting more and more  comfortable with it "
108,"I always compare myself to guys I'm in love with and ofcourse being in love gives the illusion that the other person is perfect. So I end up trying to look perfect all the time, even though I know perfection will never be achieved. 

So, to answer your question, yes."
109,"Also check out r/lgbteens. Full of bi, gay, trans, etc. teens like yourself! Good luck."
110,Seems to me your Aunt is more interested in keeping her son as her little boy than letting him grow up. He's 18. Of course he's going to think about sex. Whether you helped him or not he's perfectly capable of doing the same thing on his own. 
111,People don’t like to be told they need to check themselves. It ain’t new 
112,"Wait, I thought the whole farting thing and nobody giving a damn was one of the perks of being a dude? Also, if they don’t get off ffs please provide some gaysisstance. Also, breakfast. Always. Or lunch if you ignored the sunrise and just kept fucking."
113,"I doubt that the reason he blocked you was that he didn’t like hearing about pineapple.  More likely it’s something like he hooks up with random people sometimes, then feels awkward and doesn’t want to say another word beyond what’s necessary once he’s wiped himself off.   He could even be trying to convince himself that he’s not gay as soon as you leave the truck, deletes his hook-up app and then in a moment of weakness 3 weeks later downloads it again. 

 Just a guess.  But it reminds me of a couple of years ago when I tried out the Tinder app.   There was a “straight” guy in a conservative suburb who had several photos with his frat type buddies. He would match with me, say hey, and tell me “You should drive out to the suburbs and get in my car and suck me.”   And I would say no and change the subject and then his profile would disappear suggesting he’d deleted the app and was embarrassed he’d made a pass at a guy maybe. Then he would match with me a week later (meaning he had downloaded the app and made a new profile) and he would say something similar and the whole cycle repeated.    I suspect if I had said yes and gone through with it he likely would have wanted to never run into each other again.  "
114,"That awkward moment when you just want to top every now and then, but you've turned your bf into a total bottom. "
115,I just want a body like his. It’s perfect
116,It’s from all the walking 
117,Sounds like something Leslie would say to Ann
118,"Yeah I remember watching that with my flat, generally I'm not bothered if comedians make gay jokes especially if they're known for lashing out at every group and not targeting us specifically, but in that special literally out of nowhere he just says he deeply doesn't want his child to be gay; not even as a joke either, just doesn't want his child to be gay. Haven't found him funny since."
119,"As long as we're equals outside the bedroom, this is a huge turn-on for me."
120,If they know you're gay and you were having gay sex what is there to explain?
121,"And so as one power falls, another shall rise in its place...

126,"Gay sex is better and feels naughtier, it's just way hotter. The best blowjob I've ever received was from a goofy dumb blonde twink with a tongue ring. Dude could suck some dick.

129,"You know when you are filling out a form online and the selections are round and you can only pick one? Sexuality isn’t like that. It’s more like a slider bar where there are an infinite number of possibilities between being attracted to girls and being attracted to guys. Where you finally wind up won’t happen until later in life and you’ll probably slide back and forth a bit on the scale...some people slide a little, some people slide a lot.  When you are so young, though, a slight breeze can make you horny.  Give it time. Experiment, fantasize... as long as you aren’t hurting anyone you’re fine (unless that’s part of the fun, then just be careful and have a safe word).  Don’t put so much pressure on yourself to define who you are right now. I’m 34 and in high school I dated 3 girls and exclusively date men now and two of my old boyfriends exclusively date women now.  Ultimately this is not what will define your life, it’s just a small peice of the whole. Relax, breathe, and jerk off to what ever makes your dick hard that day."

131,"Hey, I'm a working comedian. 

&amp;#x200B;

What Kevin Hart said initially was a joke. Wasn't funny, but I can forgive that. All comedians have dud jokes. But his insistent behavior after the fact is what sold it for me. The dude legitimately is uncomfortable with gay people. If you watch his interview with Graham Norton, the whole time he's on edge and feels weirded out. At first I thought maybe it was just an American being in a new land type deal. Also Graham is a ridiculous host anyway so it can throw most people off. 

&amp;#x200B;

But his response about how he wouldn't apologize? All he had to do was say it was a bad joke that didn't take. The fact he's so defensive isn't because he's protecting a joke. Tons of comedians protect jokes but apologize for the situation around it. This is a homophobic asshole who is defiant because some part of him genuinely believes what he says. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck him. And the fuck the lot of people over on /r/Movies for protecting him. The situation is nowhere comparable to James Gunn either for those who want to make that comparison. Gunn actually apologized before the tweets had surfaced, apologized after and still had stuff taken away. That was kind of harsh. Kevin actively gave up his role in the Oscars because he's either too proud or too homophobic to apologize. Fuck him. "
132,"You could always talk to him about it and open up the conversation in a casual way. 

“What’s your opinion on getting woken up with a blowjob?”

If he responds positively, then ask if he’d be okay with you doing that to him. Let him know he shouldn’t expect it right away (since I understand you want to keep the element of surprise here) but want to know firsthand since you want to respect boundaries and all. 

If he says yes, then go fucking ham on that cock."
133,I don’t think they’re our forbidden fruit.  I think we are actually their forbidden fruit!
134,"This is his special love language. 

Do not shame him, or make fun of him. Be open to letting him be the best, most nerdy, fucked up version of himself he can be. 

Example. Eight years ago I met a guy who had two shih-tzu dogs. He began to refer to me over time as the dogs’s “momma”.  At first hated it. I felt as if he should validate my masculinity. As time went on I realized I didn’t need him to validate my male identity. Co workers often take me for straight unless I come out, I am extremely butch, quite male, not really a sissy, and so on. 

Now a days it is the cutest thing. All my friends are jealous because he is a Southern Alabama boy, and he will take the dogs for a ride in my car on the weekends to “fill up momma’s gas tank” and all my friends think it is so cute. He is a doting partner, the dogs are easily the best thing ever, and I actually love being the “mom”. I also have a son who laughs and joke along too, referring to me as momma. "
135,Why? You lack confidence. 
136,"So, a friend and I were in a music store in town and a bunch of bros came in. My friend, whom is normally Jack from Will and Grace just hyped up a couple notches. He was extremely loud on purpose trying to get their attention and giving them this squinty eye look.

I said, what the fuck are you doing?
He said flirting.
I almost pissed myself I was laughing so hard.

143,"My brother knew before anyone else. I'd come to him for advice over our dad because I figured he'd have better insight on my problems. He was the one who understood it the most, I think. After he found out I was gay he had a switch go off in him. He went from arrogant and selfish to very protective over night. He helped me keep my secret for years, always diverting attention away from me whenever our parents wanted to talk about why I didn't have a girlfriend.

My mom was second on the list. She'd made jokes about homosexuality before so I wasn't too sure if that was how she really felt or if she was just saying it to go along with my dad. I'd sat down to tell her and I kept stuttering the entire time never getting anything across. I told her I wasn't ever going to have a girlfriend. (I guess saying the words out loud was the hardest) She starts going into a long bout of how I can't think that way and there's a lovely woman out there waiting for me. My brother, as he was passing by, says very nonchalantly ""He's gay, mom."" She looked like she'd seen a ghost. Then when she'd processed everything she asks if I hate her for all of the things she's said in the past. It was a very emotional coming out. We went for ice cream after.

My dad was arguably the easiest. We were out on a miniature golf course and I went with him to get hot dogs while mom and brother found a seat. He says I should go talk to the woman standing at the end of the stand. I said ""She's not really my type, dad.."" He grunts and turns his head for a few seconds. He then points at a guy nearby and asks ""He your type?"" with a giant cheesy smile. I then made a joke that I liked my guys a little beefier. It wasn't as awkward as I thought it'd be.."
144,I've only had one straight friend ask to see and it blew his mind. He was legit upset that he can't get it up for a dude once he realized how easy it is to get dick. He then yelled at me for not being slutty enough since I don't really hook up. Poor guy...
145,"Or just propose without a ring, and go get matching rings together &lt;3

To answer your question OP, there's no way a gay wedding ""should"" go, unless you ask people who work in the wedding industry. IMO we're freed from a lot of the expectations placed on straight couples. $10k on ONE night? ***FUCK*** that, more like 10k towards a house downpayment to build an entire life together!

Keep loving your mother, but don't worry about correcting her.

&amp;#x200B;

She's an adult, you're not raising her, if she loves you (which I am guessing she does), she'll accept you eventually. In the meantime, as long as she doesn't force you to do anything, just let her find her way to acceptance.

&amp;#x200B;

If she never fully accepts your sexuality, it happens, remember that this is one aspect of a complex individual.

165,"This is her problem. 

* If you keep enabling her, she will never get over it.
* Someday you will talk to her and she will ask ""what have you been doing?"" and you will think ""well, I went to dinner with my gay friends, I can't talk about that, I volunteered for the gay community center, I can't talk about that, I went dancing at a gay club, I can't talk about that, I went to dinner in the gay neighborhood with friends, I can't talk about that, I went to the gay bar, I can't talk about that, I had a date with a man, I can't talk about that,"" and you will say ""oh, nothing,"" and talk about the weather. Eventually you will realize you never talk about anything any more and stop calling her. 
* Someday you will meet someone. Plan to keep him a secret from her forever? How do you think he will feel about being ""your dirty little secret""? How long do you think it will be before he leaves you because you make him feel like you are ashamed of him? If you do reveal him to her, how do you think he's going to feel when she bursts into tears and cries for an hour? 

She's supposed to be an adult. She has a \*child\* for goodness sake, it's not like she has any right to pretend that sex never happens. It's time for her to become a responsible adult and get over it, for her child's well being. Give her the number of your nearest PFLAG chapter and tell her she needs to learn to deal with it because you can't live your life for her benefit forever. "

However, around Dec. 1st my father calls me and says that my mother is really sad and he would like me to go home before Christmas. The conversation was:

Dad: “Kiddo, you have to come home before Christmas, please, your mother would love to have you here this year, you know how she’s with Christmas” (this is for another history, she hates it)

Me: “Dad, I already bought the ticket, for January 3rd, I’ll be going home soon!” (LIAR)

Dad: “It doesn’t matter, I’ll pay the difference so you can come around 24th, I already looked the prices, I’ll buy your new ticket today”

My only choice was to come clean to him, right?

Me: “Dad...are you close to mom?” 

Dad: “Yep”

Me: “Okay, I need you to go in the garden, I need to speak with you alone”

Dad: “We’re your parents! Everything you have to say to me you can say to her”

Me: “No, Dad, please”

Dad: “We will love you no matter what, you can tell us both anything! Is it because you’re gay and are afraid to come back home?? We already know”

Me: “...”

Dad: “...”

Me: “No, I,  uhm, you knew??”

Dad: “Yeah”

Me: “Oh... But no, I was trying to say I already bought the ticket to 24th... I was trying to make a surprise, I planned everything with Brother”

Dad: “Ooooooooh”

Me: “Yeah...”

Mom: “So you’re not gay?” (This way I discovered I was on speakers)

Me: “Bisexual”

Mom and Dad: “Isn’t it the same thing?” “No it’s like when you marry two people” “but two? He doesn’t even have a boyfriend yet!”

Me: “Mom??? Dad???”

Both: “We love you, son, see you soon”

The moment his clothes were off (6 weeks after our first date)  and he was standing in front of me I had a huge smile. He is muscled with beautiful proportions. His pecs are big and muscular with medium/large nips that get hard when he gets hard. (HOT as hell!) And he is hung a true 9"" X 6"". (Years later I measured) My two favorite parts on a man are pecs and cock. My husband is perfect (to me) Deciding to wait to have sex was incredibly erotic. We were falling in love. We were getting to know each other and went on 3 (or more) dates a week leading up to getting naked. The wait was worth it. 10 years later very much in love and I still love seeing him naked. "

By the way, 10-year-olds have no business being at a gay club at 03:00 in the morning - let alone at a gay club at any time of the day, or anywhere other than their bed between 22:00 and 08:00 the next day.

The child should be asleep at 03:00 and when he’s awake he should be at school, watching telly, climbing trees, doing homework, playing video games, doing sports, taking swimming lessons, playing with toys, spending time with his friends who are close to his age... not *this*. *This* is straight up child abuse.

I had crushes on men in my favorite movies (I was around 5 or 6). So I didn't fully know I was gay but that I was different and maybe the ""liking girls"" hadn't kicked in yet at my age. 

I believe it's said that children start developing sexually traits at six so for the information given in your post, he could be.

I had a crush on one, I still remember his name. His mom hated me so much, she literally transferred him to another school because she noticed my odd behavior and crush. If I may give a suggestion OP, something my dad did to me or around me when I was younger and still does to this day is he always suggests “which girls do you find attractive, which are you gonna marry? etc.” Now when he would do that, it would make me feel awful, question myself, feel like I MUST marry a girl only, like I had no other option. My dad would do it to me and my two brothers, and he would push it. Your husband sounds much much more compassionate and sweet than my dad, so please please don’t take this as me saying he’s doing something wrong ):, I’d only suggest for him to ease on those jokes since I know that’s how they made me feel when I was young. You both are so, SO loving and caring, and doing an incredible job. If only all little LGBTQ youth had you as parents growing up (‘:. Be sure to give him time as well to be sure that’s what he truly feels. You both are doing so perfect. (: "

* To get the ring size, take a trip to the mall. As a ""lark"" go to a jewelry store with him. Find a ring you like. Then say you want to know your ring size... then casually say as you are getting it, ""Hey, how about you?"" That's how I did it. I should have won an academy award.
* I asked my now husband at dinner. I had the restaurant serve the ring as a course. I planned it with them all in advance.
* A wedding planner can help you do everything... including translating what is done for straight people in the gay context. You get to be creative with them... and they do lots of stuff like arrange flowers, food, budget, guest lists, blah... blah... blah. Worth every penny.

Best of luck!"

We had multiple mutual friends but I was too pussy to add him on Facebook. One day he held the door open for me and I was so nervous and happy. Turns out he was gay and a friend of mine put in a good word. When I met him we hooked up and got closer, and closer. Learning his flaws ruined this picture perfect image I had of him and  it made me realize everyone has flaws they’re hiding. "
231,"Although I love them, theres just something about enacting my sexual will onto another man and vise versa thats so much hotter than with a woman.  "
232,Or show them a picture of the San Francisco Armory and ask if they’ve ever seen this place before 😏

234,"I think there's a difference between being attracted to guys that often end up being straight (what you described) and getting off on the idea that a man being sexual with you is straight (""straight fetish""), and that they don't really come from the same place at all necessarily. "
235,"Same. I had just figured out how to download videos.

That said, the CP had gotten out of hand and they weren't willing to moderate it the way it required, so this was the next best answer. "

237,"Just remember high school is complete bullshit. Just get through it, it will get much better!  Don’t worry about the friends you loose who can’t handle you being gay. They aren’t worthy of your friendship. "
238,"Invest your time and attention in yourself, not in him.    

He's falling in love with you, but then you get into a relationship and you change.   You're suddenly hyperfocused on him.    You are, apparently, more interesting to a mate when you're not with somebody.  

So figure out who you are -- sans a partner -- and improve your interests and aptitudes for those things that you already like and enjoy.   And when you do attract another someone, stay with your own life -- don't abandon it for his.  

A good partnership is two circles that intersect about 20%.  He is still himself, you are still yourself.  You both are complete, alone.  But that 20% where/when you intersect, you're greater than the sum of your parts.   You are his best friend and, to be that, you still have to be you.    You can't be his ""mini-me.""  "
239,Nah bro I’m straight. But definitely don’t ask me again: I feel safe with you and am so weak. 
240,"Picking up some flowers. My guy and I may be the more ""masculine"" type, but flowers are always nice.

241,"Your mother wants to keep her lazy, self-flattering bigotry without *looking* hateful, and your siblings don't want to have to deal with conflict.  In other words, none of them are thinking about you at all. You have to be the one who cares about you, *somebody* has to.

You're being gaslighted by your mom and your siblings when they act like you shouldn't care, or that your mother's contempt for your life and identity and indifference to your happiness and well-being are compatible with ""love.""  You are allowed to have respect for your dreams, your fiancé, your relationship, and your identity, and it is reasonable to expect your own family members not to attack and disparage those things without provocation. You are totally within your rights to uphold healthy boundaries by not submitting to your mother's manipulation, and if your siblings tell you you're being ""uppity"" for having a healthy and appropriate degree of respect for yourself, you can stop taking their phone calls too. Worst case scenario: they sit around complaining to each other about how badly you ""wronged"" them by not accepting abuse with endless tolerance and charity and an utter neglect for your own well-being, while you go on living a happy life that doesn't include wasting your time and your gifts on such self-centred people who don't appreciate them anyway.  

If that's an unfair assessment of them, they can pleasantly surprise you and prove you wrong at any time by deigning to treat you like a person - whose life, feelings, and aspirations matter. It's really not much to ask. But if you just meekly accept this kind of treatment, they'll never have any incentive to do so.  They'll continue to prefer avoiding conflict over working through the damage your mother is choosing to inflict on your relationship and your family as a whole, and nothing will change. Your fiancé will have to deal with being treated badly every time you see your family, and that will take a toll on your relationship.  If you have children with him, they will grow up in a shamed and disrespected family, which will be an alienating and insecure way to grow up.  How are they going to trust people, or recognize their value when their own grandmother and uncles and aunts feel entitled to treat their family like crap, and their father says that's acceptable?  It's not selfish of you to prioritize the well-being of your partner and potential children over your mother's prejudice and your siblings' lazy aversion to conflict."
242,I was once a Mormon missionary. It’s just as frustrating on your mission to be around so many hot guys. I had one particular companion who used to get naked in front of me. He was a beautiful man with a gorgeous body. He once laid on top of me when I was sleeping and I laid there enjoying his warm body. After I  got home from my mission I would track down the missionaries and befriend them just to keep hanging with them. 
243,"Yeah, it's easy when they are already hot lol"
244,That won't stop me :D
245,First of all... Shawn Mendes
246,"Welcome to sex life, buddy. It's underwelming and awkward, and only gets better when you practice. Cheer up, get another man, learn from your mistakes and do it again."
247,"I told her ""I will become straight when you become a lesbian."" She doesn't comprehend logic. She just resorts to ""I should have aborted you"" when I one up her. "
248,"That’s awesome, I was in a similar boat with my BF except we were both primarily tops. I had only bottomed a few times and never enjoyed it. Finally bottomed for him and it was unreal, I felt like I got blasted into outer space lol"
249,"At least you had a guy that was understanding of it.  It shows that he was probably more caring about you than you might think.

Maybe in the future you don't need to explain the abuse, but just explain that you are really shy and get nervous easily the first time you are intimate with someone.  Explain it ahead of time so the guy expects it instead of being surprised by it.

251,"Oh crap, I forgot to get a boyfriend for this Christmas!"
252,Maybe he has different expectations for the relationship and doesn’t want something exclusive.  3.5 months is more than enough time for a romantic relationship to develop.
253,"My neph is fine with it, even though he's young, he's already quite vulgar at his age. But he just love to make my life miserable so he's sure to exaggerate everything.

254,"Lucky you, maintaining body hair is awful."
255,"Yep. Honestly. If I didnt have bad anxiety,  I would be much more attractive. I just lack confidence. 

One of the main things about myself that I hate is that the guy of my dreams use to like me when we first met until he realized how different we are. Hes very outgoing and likes guys who are very confident and outspoken, goes to parties and just let's lose. Its frustrating because I can be that person and actively seek out opposite people because I have a bit of a mirror personality and will learn and become just as outgoing as they are.

Now, he tells me he doesnt know how he feels about me sexually. I dont even know what that means, cause we still have sex "
256,And if he never went for it. What would you do?
257,Everyone goes on about the straight fantasy but straight guys are the worst people to have sex with
258,If anything I’m more so shocked people would state that on their Facebook
259,"&gt; but I also have Tinder notifications off, and check the app at weekends, at most

That should be in your bio if it’s not already the case, others cannot really guess that. For most, a lack of answer within a certain timeframe come across as a lack of interests and they move on.

That’s why I left dating apps because everybody has a different definition and opinion of chat etiquettes and it’s hard to find a balance."
260,"Dear OP, it wasn't rape because there was no penetration. It was definitely a sexual harassment, though."

266,"[Well there’s this...](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/09/11/politics/kfile-roy-moore-kevin-swanson/index.html) 

[And this about Ted Cruz...](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/opinion/campaign-stops/ted-cruz-and-the-anti-gay-pastor.amp.html)

[While not a GOP official, but certainly more evidence of my point about the religious right..](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-hateful-pastor-all-too-happy-to-be-left-behind-when-it-comes-to-gays)

Full disclosure: **Neither Ted Cruz or Roy Moore actually said gays should be “put to death.”** 

**However, actively embracing people that do, infers that they are either complacent or condoning of the people that do make those claims.**

I realize you may try to pin me down on my words about saying “the GOP and many of it’s members.” I will admit where I made a mistake. I should have been more clear.
But when I said members of the GOP, I didn’t just mean people that actually held office. I should have changed my words and said “people who are conservative in ideology.”

I also realize you may point the fact that I linked 2 “liberal/left” media sources. They are not the only media outlets that reported on these stories.

But once again: As long as members of the GOP (public official or not) still associate with the Religious Right, I will never support them.

Is my ass still loose now?"
267,"You don’t have to be closeted.

Come out. Take the loss. Get into a fist fight with a homophobe. Go the gym and get real big so you’ll scare your relatives. Get a neck tattoo. 

Choose life. "
268,"I know! But that little ~~shit~~guy always wanted to make fun of him. I can't even punish him because he's not my kid. And WHAT's WORSE, my bf is quite fond of him and they hang out quite often. That ~~bitch~~kid is only 11 yet he's already in control of my life."
269,Maybe they’re doing all the talking and you’re just busy chowing down.

273,"When I was 12 or 13 I inadvertently came out to my older brother. I'd crushed on his friends before but nothing like what I felt for this one boy I knew. I remember going up to my brother and asking what I should do about my crush. He got really excited that he could finally help me talk to women. I told him no I wasn't crushing on a girl, but my friend who regularly came over to hang out with me.

My brother gave me this big ol bear hug when I said that. And after a lot of stuttering, finally tells me that I might end up scaring my crush off as most boys my age would be looking at girls. It finally hit me. *I was gay*. I held out in telling my crush about my feelings until I was 14. Then, as my brother predicted, it scared him the hell off.

But I married him, so obviously I didn't scare him off too badly."
274,"Yes, he may know at that age.  I knew when I was 8.  "
275,"I went through a similar situation with my now ex best friend. Let’s just say I was able to take it for about a year. I mainly did it because she had been a fundamental part of my life for long and I kept on telling myself that it didn’t matter. When it became too much, I politely asked her to stop saying stuff like that because it was hurting me. 

She didn’t and I simply had to learn that some people are just too damaging. I ended our friendship.

276,"Time square is good to see if you’re a first time tourist in nyc. I wouldn’t spend more than a couple of hours there. The food is not good and it’s overloaded with tourists. I would suggest going to Gramercy Park, East Village, SOHO, Greenwich Village to see the real New Yorker parts of nyc. Don’t get food in time square. 

You should also checkout the High Line and Grand Central Station while you’re there. Oh the Brooklyn Bridge is pretty cool too. "

282,"Even if he *were* gay, then we should support him when he comes out; we shouldn't force him to come out or joke about his sexuality / imagined sex life -- particularly when that rhetoric is based on the same sort of stereotyping and homophobia straight people use against us.

&gt;You fucking guys are so lucky I’m not actually gay and terrified of coming out"
283,"Did a variation of this last night. Invited him over to watch a movie; didn't get through the opening credits. I prefer this approach because it gives you the chance to back out if you're not feeling it. ""\*yawns\* Well that was a great movie but I gotta get to bed. Do this again?"""
284,"Former Mormon here. They’re nice and cute but when you’re actually one of those missionaries and gotta live with one 24/7 it’s fucking annoying. I had an attractive companion but damn he was stupid AND annoying. I ended up hating him and is the only companion that I no longer speak with. They’re attractive cuz they’re young and dumb. Some are nice. Some are weird but trust me, looks fade."
285,Better douche tomorrow night 🤭🤭
286,Interesting to know there are Mormons who have some leniency when it comes to gay sex. I always assumed they were pretty black and white with that stuff.

293,"when you meet the right guy, you won't have worries about anything moving too fast.

every relationship I ever had, I set strict time tables in my head... third date = sex, 1 month = define the relationship talk, only see each other 2-3 times/week early on, etc.

when I met the guy who eventually became my husband, none of that mattered... we fucked on the first date, defined the relationship after like a week, and spent every single day together."
294,I like low hanging balls because I can get one in each nostril
295," Not that creepy at all. Humans are a social species and we like physical contact with one another. However, guys (i assume you're a guy)  especially, don't get enough platonic physical contact.

A huge reason guys kill themselves so much more is because we lack proper support networks (both emotional and physical). Many studies have shown just normal skin - skin contact can help treat mental illness and increase overall health."
