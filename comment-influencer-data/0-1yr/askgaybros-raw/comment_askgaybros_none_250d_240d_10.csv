1,"Before anyone comments, go through OP’s history.

That being said, I would choose to move past it. I don’t see why it’s unforgivable. Some people were brainwashed by religion. Should we just assume someone who was once religious can never be fully atheist? That’s nonsensical to me."
2,"100%. Gay people, especially on this sub, can be just as ignorant and bigoted as the people who marginalize them, unfortunately."
3,"Same old tired crap, I am sure. "
4,"I've seen more trans people claiming transphobia simply because some people don't want to date them than I have gay people who truly don't like trans people. Maybe it's more common in hookup circles like grindr, but I've only ran into one gay dude who left me with the impression that he straight up doesn't like trans people. "
5,Got me crying over my lunch. Beautifully written :)
6,"You said you're from Indonesia, I would absolutely recommend that you use condoms every single time. Your country is in the middle of an HIV epidemic. There are almost 50,000 new HIV infections EVERY YEAR in Indonesia. 

http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/indonesia

&gt;In 2016, Indonesia had 48 000 (43 000 - 52 000) new HIV infections and 38 000 (34 000 - 43 000) AIDS-related deaths. 

And gay men like yourself are higher risk than the rest of the population. 

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use condoms. Your life depends on it. "
7,"I don't think you have any obligation to tell him, but obviously don't have sex if you see him before the test results are back (or at that point decide to tell him). Well, correction, I wouldn't tell him *unless* you have had sex already and may already have passed it on to him - which if you did, then he may have passed it on to others, etc. etc. "
8,Should we start naming the representation of feminine men in media? I'm willing to bet it's not even comparable. 
9,I understood that reference
10,It didn't.
11,"I was 11, he was 13"
12,I don’t understand why he would ghost someone he’d have to see regularly like what a moron. A break-off conversation is not that difficult?? 
13,Im no gay or bro.... but like just wear condoms and make sure the person you’re getting intimate with is STD free (careful cause some kids lie) 
14,"Gay cruising is still definitely a thing. Usually among the older crowd. 

I was made fully aware of this when i went to a park toilet. It had about 20 other guys in it. It was only after i took a piss and walked out that i realised that i was the only one using the urinal. Everyone else was just standing around. Then it dawned on me...."
15,"People are not computers you can get according to specs you like. There's a great role of random chance in who and when will be your boyfriend. No guarantees, just keep being nice to guys. You should try learning to depend on this random chance less, be self content more, and genuinely happy for the couples."
16,"Me too!! There are people out there who want to date and have relationships. It took me over a year and a half to find someone who likes me and isn’t only wanting sex. My advice would be to stop hooking up and only meet dudes who want to date. 

You just have to hang in there and find someone you actually want to be around. 

Good luck!!"

19,"It does seem to help, but it also seems like a dangling fruit that just lures you in to need it more. I'm sorry you have to keep it bottled up so much, that is definitely a hard situation to be in..."
20,not enough electroshocks
21,That's great man! Maybe not the ideal way to come out hahaha but it worked :)
22,"Get some therapy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because:

1.) To maintain a good relationship with any guy, you have to be okay with yourself and be happy on your own. You can't make your happiness dependant on other people. It will smother them and drive them away.

2.) You won't find a boyfriend with that negative attitude. People are attracted to positivity, not to downers.

3.) Once you worked on yourself, your fears and insecurities, and gained some footing, life will get better and you will get a boyfriend, but it will still not be without its troubles. Life will always be with its challenges."
23,You never gonna be bland. Stop describing your accent like that.
24,"Same here. I think a lot of guys confuse sex and love. 

I have zero interest in monogamy but I have a great boyfriend who I love a lot. I can go enjoy amazing sex and a good conversation with another guy and still know who I want to go home to. "
25,What does he do - lead you round a stadium like in a dog show? 
26,[Citation needed]
27,Also he needs to clarify what he means by not living alone.  Is he with his parents?  (bad).  Does he have roommates to save on costs?  (Good).  Huge difference.
28,"I would drop you so fast if we were dating and you blew me off to go fuck a rando. Shit or get off the pot, bud. "
29,You too! 
30,I’d be supportive as a friend but we’d break up. It’s not my thing but I’d want them to be happy 
31,"I'm so sorry, friend. ❤

Sending you Love!  ❤"
32,I think tinder is more dating oriented than most apps 
33,Is it? actually in some tv series i think its definitely an over representation 
34,"Yeah, sucks to know I’m missing out on the pleasures of sensitive foreskin... "
35,"My fiance and I are 12 years apart and we've been mistaken for almost every familial relationship. Father/son, brothers, cousins, uncle/nephew"
36,"Lol me

I’m a total “macho” straight guy as in I can hang with my straight friends and I loved that jock life. 

But when a big dick fucks me good? I buck my big ass and moan. Guys love seeing a big muscle dude bitch out in bed "
37,hell yeah. 
38,"In the age of the internet when we find each other by search terms, surely you can see the complication of googling ""men who like men"" vs. ""gay men.""

But regardless, *why not*? What's the harm in having simple language to describe experiences? What advantage does ""I'm a man who's pretty much exclusively attracted to other men"" have over ""I'm a gay man""?

If the potential that ""maybe someday I could be attracted to a woman"" is nagging at you, why not try ""queer"" on? A lot of folks like the ambiguity of it."
39,"If someone asks if you’re gay, and you explain you’re attracted almost exclusively to men but don’t choose to identify with that label... they’re still gonna see you as gay and they’re just gonna think you’re insecure about it. Why not just own your gayness and make it your own? The more of us who exist as diverse examples of what “gay” can look and act like, the faster we can break down those toxic stereotypes."
40,All those times I was in Europe and wasn’t out... fuck. 
41,"Do not panic, it's not a problem. Just breath and go step by step. Talk to me in PMs if you want"
42,Wut. 
43,"Phew. Of course it isn't.

That would be a rdiculous thing to say, tbh. "
44,"Wait, are you saying it is, or it isn't?

I've never heard anyone say it. "
45,Downvoted by the guys without boyfriends I suppose lol.
46,"I could never do an open relationship. I don't think my BF could either. No judge for what other guys are doing, but I don't think I would like the idea of him fucking someone else, it would bother me a lot. I think wanting an open relationship would be a deal breaker for me."
47,"Just wanted to say, your story touched me and I'm so, so sorry for your loss. From one gay man to another, I send my sincere love and hope that you take the advice you were given and survive for both you and your husband's memory."
48,"&gt; The truth of the matter is this: we are all dying, every one of us

this is often difficult to process but also a comforting thought. no one ever truly goes alone. thank you for sharing your experience."
49,To answer your question - No. But I knew a guy with a sensitive anus who would come 2 or 3 times whilst being fucked
50,"I do work it's just that it's not enough that I could live out my own in my own place devoid of cost of living sharing.

And I live just by myself with my little brother."
51,"If you have the means and that’s how you want to spend your life, being a parent is a great idea. Gay-parented kids are doing fine and probably much better on average than their hetero-parented counterparts. 
Bigots will  have negative things to say no matter what, but facts stand on their own-very VERY few gay couples have kids on accident(obviously). 
It is usually a meticulously planned process and the parents are dedicated to raising their child. 

if you’re worried about being a bad parent now, you’re already doing better than most parents. Any kid would be lucky to have you as a dad or mom "
52,"About half of republicans actually support gay marriage. Doesn't necessarily speak for the entirety of conservatism, but a majority of Americans support gay rights"
53,Porn is always better if the people doing it are actually enjoying themselves. There is nothing more off-putting and more of a boner killer than people not enjoying themselves and not being into each other.
54,"because any masculinity is toxic masculinity, apparently. "
55,I went to Starbucks with a guy and he was blatantly checking Grindr the entirety of the date.
56,"1. Very much so
2. Makes sense. Thank you so much
3. Definitely! I trust him :)"
57,That's a pretty grim way to be. Any particular reason for it?
58,Probs gonna jack it. 
59,Good luck to you as well.
60,Scotland 
61,"ONE OF US

ONE OF US"
62,Sometimes the head of my dick gets so sensitive after a while that it actually starts to hurt when ppl are sucking or jacking it and I make a noise(out of pain) but 9 times out of 10 the other guy just thinks he's doing a bomb ass job and gets even more into it....not fun.
63,"""Frat Boys Fuck Tied Up Bitch"" on Pornhub. It's good for those who can't find a good rape scene."
64,I like myself some Chris Stapleton and Sturgill Simpson!
65,"Thanks for all the advices, and for helping me clarify the situation. I'm 23 yo now, No I won't be near him alone anymore."
66,"Personally I was pretty much the same, but it bugged me so much I one day thought fuck it there's only one way to know for sure if I like it or not, and downloaded grindr. I found someone who was kinda attractive to me and asked to meet up after a while of back and forth messaging to make sure he wasn't a serial killer or catfish. Met up, sucked his dick, enjoyed it, never saw or heard from him again. I'm still me, still the same person, still like girls, but I now have a boyfriend who I love and my life is a million times better. Just gotta take the plunge man (in a safe, sane and consensual way of course). "
67,"I guess my point being if someone invited me over to watch a movie, I'd just assume we'd be watching about 15 minutes of the movie and then sex-ing. "
68,I’m from Southern California. I get weird looks whenever I say how sexy the German language is. Hard to describe. But it’s very clipped and authoritative. I am too. Maybe that’s why. I also think the posh English accent is incredibly sexy. Like Fassbender in INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS. Trans-Atlantic is also really hot to me. Very similar. 
69,"Don't wait until you feel like you look good enough to go to these places because you will run into the ""never enough"" problem real quick. Go to a gay bar/space without any expectations, or any distractions, and just be there for the experience. It is absolutely taboo at this point to look at peoples' reactions there as confirmation of whether you're attractive or not.

Only about 5% of the crowd is going to find you attractive, and the more calm and open you appear, the more approachable you will be for that 5%. 

Believe me I didn't see myself as attractive. I just sat there alone sipping on my beer watching the drag queens perform not expecting anyone to hit on me. To my amazement I had a few hot guys stare at me intensely, a couple approached me and commented on me, some would touch my arm too, and I even had one cute guy kiss me, which was absolutely surreal to me. 

You know how when you look at a guy and see that he does not fit into the image of a model yet you still find him insanely hot? Well what's stopping other men from looking at you the same way?

The most important thing is to be confident, you don't have to be the best of the best, just appear relaxed and like you're having a good time. Nervous energy makes it hard to approach you, which is why it is important to see this as an experiment rather than validation of your looks. Give yourself permission to go and go there to have a good time, not soley to seek approval. It can be really cool to just go out and do stuff compared to just standing in front of a mirror critisizing yourself to no end."

don't think that was it, but thanks.  looks like it has a lot of really good info!

am going to keep looking anyway, but keeping track of this."
72,"HIV from oral is VERY rare.  You’re not really in any danger especially if you’ve been tested twice in six months and clear both times.  

At this point, you should address your high anxiety about sex with a psychologist or a counselor.  Otherwise, you’ll be miserable for the rest of your life. 

Also, talk to your doc about taking PreP which prevents HIV infection so you can lower your anxiety and live your life.  It will help."
73,"Yea. I told myself I would go back on apps when I'm happy with my weight. It's been about 11 long months. Ugh.

But I'm 4 days into my diet and down several pounds already. I want to drop about 10-15 more pounds so it's doable.

I don't know how some guys are looking on Grindr when they're 200+ pounds and not muscular. I would be so self conscious."
74,Internet culture is becoming too sensitive.  Racey jokes are still laughed at in person...
75,"A raccoon was stuck in one of my empty garbage cans this morning, should I have called animal control instead of letting it go?"
76,I don't subscribe to the notion that all straight people are homophobic.
77,"We would have to break up. I’d try to be supportive, but generally I don’t remain friends with my exes anyway, so I know in all reality I’d likely separate myself entirely. "
78,"Because people are individuals, and not everyone has the same opinions. "
79,"If I like and want to get more acquainted with a date, I stop hookups/etc. There is no rule that says this must be the case unless we actually talk about exclusivity or whatever, though. However, if I am into him, I absolutely wouldn't ever blow him off. That seems a quick way to make sure he doesn't reciprocate being into you."
80,"In any significant number? The fact is that the vast majority of people are fine and exaggerating the experiences of the minority only serves to unnecessarily scare people into thinking they need to hide who they are. It does more damage than good, in my opinion."
81,"Just be careful this isn't someone playing a joke, probably not but worth considering. "
82,I’m a bear and happiest I’ve ever been as a gay man
83,You forgot the water/silicone hybrid lube. You get a slicker lube that lasts longer than water based and can be used with silicone toys if the silicone is not to great a percentage if the lube
84,It breaks down the silicone toy
85,"I am confident you'll get your dream real one day dude and I know you'll be a great father no matter how you get there. 

Where there's a will there's a way. And beware.. sometimes that ""way"" might not be the way we thought it would be.."
86,Yes
87,How
88,Interesting!!!
89,The toy breaks down and can harbor bacteria easier because silicon is a porous material. 
90,That’s been suggested. I’d just rather show my face. I almost wonder if I’ve made someone angry and they continually report me...
91,Congratulations! :)
92,Creepy.
93,"I recommend you purchase a series of butt plugs of increasing girth and length to practice anal stretching.  Take your time and relax as you do this. If it hurts then stop. I found it helpful to get to know that part of my body just like I learned about my dick. I played with it to see what felt good and what didn’t work so well. If you take this approach you can enjoy the journey as you prepare to bottom. Relaxation is also key. Being anxious tightens the sphincter. Not good when trying to avoid pain. Cleaning out properly also helps to relax. At least it lessens one concern. Not only do I recommend you experiment with toys, I recommend you finger yourself. Try using. A single lubed finger to feel around your butt, then on your hole itself. See how it feels. Go up to your taint and back down. Get to know and enjoy your body at a deeper level. Then SLOWLY insert a finger. See how just having your fingertip in feels. Go a little deeper and move your finger around. Try fucking yourself only to this depth. After you’ve explored that go deeper still. Only a few inches in you should feel for a walnut sized gland called your prostate. It is chock full of nerve endings and us therefore incredibly sensitive. At first prostrate stimulation was overwhelming for me it was so sensitive but after awhile I was begging guys to pound it as hard as they could! Lol. Here’s the thing. Some guys like to bottom. Some don’t. Some bottoms can handle a lot more than others ever care to even try. This is your body and your journey. Listen to your body to know what feels good and what your limits are, at least for today. Who knows? Maybe you’ll be getting fisted in the new year!"
94,"You'll sure find a partner who shares those interests.

One of the most pleasing sensations when dating (my opinion) is to introduce your SO into your hobbies and passions. You'll be surprised of how fun it feels to hold their hands into something new for them that you already ""mastered"" and enjoy"
95,Trade him in for someone who will...
96,There's plenty of guys like that. I'm one (except the rodeo). But if you hold out on very specific traits you'll miss out on some awesome people. It's fun to interact with others and share your interest as well as learning theirs.
97,Pointless arguing with a child 
98,"So I had no idea somnophilia was a thing or that other people had the same interest. I thought it was rapeish so I always hid it. I decided to Look it up on here and figured out it was a real thing and that other people share. Even after finding that people share that interest I still think its pretty close to rape.
To get to the point.. my girlfriend was sexually assaulted when she was 13/14 she's 23 now.. But obviously rape is something she hates and its very touchy subject and Rightfully so. I've only done this with my girlfriend and would never rape or touch a random sleeping person just want to make that clear....
But I'd like the opinion of a girl preferably. Guys can share there opinon as well. Should I tell her about this or act like its not a thing? She has woke up before with me touching her so she knows I've done some stuff while she's asleep.
Again just would like an opinion on if I should tell her or not. Thanks."
99,"I had a mate a while back who when he wanked next to me in bed, shot his load then eat what was on his abs. Grossed me out! Straight from the dick whilst blowing him, I could do, but just watching him scrape up the cum was totally awful. I gagged more from that than deepthroating him 😂"
100,"It was a space and auto correct, but it still stands that your dickishness wants to stand out today"
101,Everyone should move to Twitter like RIGHT NOW. Made an account in 2013 and never left
102,"No it's not you stupid fucking piece of shit, not unless you both have bloody open mouth sores and he cums in the open sore"
103,Yup
104,This isn't a fucking diary 
105,"Yeah I definitely don’t feel like those are all boxes that need checked in a potential partner, but they’re on the list of “things that will make this relationship easier”. Especially CFB! "
106,Oh wow....well I guess I just have to not gurgle the cum at all or just not suck him off at all. 😭
107,"lol, seen gifs of this but never heard it."
108,"Hmm... There could be a lot of factors. Some of these may sound harsh but my intention is not to hurt you but I also don't want to sugar coat.

**1) Attraction to bad boys**

Even though it may seem illogical, many people are attracted towards 'abusive' assholes because they confuse confidence with arrogance. If you grew up with bad self-esteem, it may be difficult to differentiate between arrogance and confidence. Arrogant people are usually very insecure despite their appearance (and hence the need to boast). Media portrays 'bad boys' as rebels (in reality, they just don't care about others and rules that are applicable to everyone else). So these sort of people use 'I don't give a fuck' as their defense to behaving like assholes. When we have bad self-esteem, it is easy to be swayed and enamored by assholes.

**2) My love will change him**

This is the fantasy narrative that people tell themselves to justify why they continue to put up with such assholes. Narcissists are very good at convincing us that they need us. Usually the script for this sort of drama is something like this: ""I fucked up because I am broken. Everyone always leaves me. You're the only one who understands me. I need you. I swear I will work on improving myself."" Rinse. Lather. Repeat. 

Sometimes these narcissists will intentionally hurt themselves as a form of emotional blackmail to prove 'See... I need you.' People who are empathetic get torn between the evidence of bad behavior and the empty promises of change. You may genuinely care for him but you cannot change someone who has no intention of changing. So instead people stay in abusive relationships hoping that their love is strong enough to change him and someday he will see how wonderful you are. 

**3) I am a giver**

This is very tricky. Some people genuinely enjoy taking care of others. But there is usually a hidden backstory. When someone says they're selfless, they usually mean 'I don't know how to accept love'. These people are really good at taking care of others but are very bad at asking for help and accepting others love. So 'giving selflessly' is a sneaky way of staying in control. If I am the giver then I am not in a vulnerable position. Do you think you are able to accept love? 

**4) I have no limits**

All humans have limits and that is healthy. Endless patience and forever forgiving is actually very dysfunctional even though it sounds very nice on paper. Forever forgiving someone who treats you like crap means that you really don't respect yourself. There is a difference between being patient and generous and being a doormat. 'I have no limits' is a nicer way of saying 'I have no self respect'. Let's say you have two toys, one valuable and one cheap. If someone broke these two toys, which one would upset you more? Why? What is the value of your love if someone walks all over it?

**5) Martyr syndrome**

People who have bad self esteem usually opt to be the martyr. Such people view their own suffering as something virtuous - suffering for a cause. Many people in abusive relationships tend to take the martyr role and justify to themselves that they are doing something noble by taking abuse. Also, being a martyr makes one feel morally superior which often manifests as condescending behavior. They expect the abusive person to feel ashamed of their actions. But narcissists don't have shame because in their world there is no one else but the narcissist. So instead, the dysfunctional relationship continues - the martyr continues making sacrifices and expects the abusive person to change.  

&amp;#x200B;

Treat yourself the way you would treat others. Have healthy boundaries in all your relationships. Loving someone does not mean 'no boundaries'.

You're ready to be patient, loving, and generous with others. Can you do the same for yourself? Can you accept love from others? "
109,How would I pm you? XD
110,Want kids so bad. Adoption for me.
111,"Bro it really is, my friends have all noticed after meeting him there’s been a huge change in me and they’ve seen me go through some shit. 

I’ve made that mistake in the past in idolizing people and it didn’t end well. I’ve been careful to not make assumptions with him. Just how the fuck is he remaining so cool and calm if he feels the same. 

Yeah that’s an obvious red flag but I understand and I’m in love with him not his parents he is out to his friends. 

Thanks for your message man. I’ll go kill myself in the gym and try and keep calm. Thanks. "
112,How much does  a surrogate cost if you don't mind me asking?
113,"Definitely do it on apps sites (Grindr, Tinder, Recon) where the goal is to get some.
Not on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, where the goal is not."
114,"I mean, I've used them when it was the only option, but I hate them, too. Especially when there's friends of you pissing right next to you. Ugh."
115,That’s so cool I’m happy for you. Was it scary? Did it hurt? I have never done it before and I’m kind of scared
116,"I am dating a vegan! I know that is very lucky :) we live together so it makes veganism, grocery shopping and holiday dinners much easier - his grandma often makes vegan options for us (she is Italian and loves to cook) sometimes if we are going to other parties we will bring food with us (like chipotle) or we will cook something vegan to bring with us.  I do feel like i have increased stamina (in bed too lol) I am actually training for a marathon currently - something that I would not necessarily have done before (dont necessarily think this is a side effect of being vegan tho I just wanted to do this)

I was not vegan when we started dating but I cant imagine living with a non vegan boyfriend&lt; at the end of the day if you love someone you can adapt your lifestyle or find someone that is respectful of yours.  

I think that with time there will be more vegans which will make finding a vegan partner much easier! Hang in there :)"
117,Dude please take care of yourself. Jumped on this thread as an older guys saying we not all douche just looking for a throw away lay but tbh more important u protect yourself.  Some nasty ppl out there man and u rly can't tell until it'd too late sometimes x

119,"Your boyfriend should be more attentive to your concerns about PDA. It's not just about feeling self-conscious, but it's also a form of self-protection to monitor your behavior out in public. 

As for the 'babe' thing and the effusive compliments. That's the type of behavior that you would expect from a girlfriend. You should tell him that the power of a compliment lies in its sparsity, not its frequency.

For the record, it could also mean that your boyfriend is insecure about your affections and constantly feels the need to remind you that he thinks the world of you, so that you won't dump him out of nowhere."
120,"Yeah, I'm just not very good at that. Burned too many times when I was younger and I guess it just made me afraid to put myself out there like that. I dunno how to get over that fear. I guess it feels like maybe it'd be easier if it was more outwardly visible.

I do pretty well at making close friendships with other guys, I just don't have much luck getting past that point."
121,"Determine how much advice the guy is really asking for. He might just need a compassionate sounding board, and it sounds like you’d be a good fit for that.

If he wants to know what to do- you don’t hafta have all the answers, you can just tell him what worked for you.

Also, not at all your job, but if you’re interested in helping, just compile some resources like hotlines he may be able to speak to or local LGBTQ groups so that he knows what options he’s got.

Most of all, it’s important for you to recognize that it’s not your burden but you are acting kindly and compassionately so, as someone who was the first to come out publicly in his school and decidedly did NOT have someone to turn to, just know that you are appreciated."
122,This is what gay bars and clubs are for. 
123,"You are so brave, thank you for sharing your story. "
124,You under quoted and over delivered. Classic sales tactic tbh 😉
125,"Once I get a small drop in my tongue just to know how it tasted. I’m a little disgusted about it. I don’t eat any other of my body fluids, except saliva, so I don’t se a problem with not liking it. That being said, I fuckin love being sucked and swallowed... "
126,"I want them, but I also don’t? But I do?

We were trying with a surrogate when I got a life threatening condition. Now we’re pushing the reset button a few years later and are trying again.  We’re in a good position (dual professional incomes) but it feels crazy the obstacles we had to go over to get to just “trying”. It’s not that it made me want it less, but it’s harder to get excited when you spent the time arguing with lawyers, getting wishy washy answers from multiple medical staff and figuring out where you draw the line financially.

But it means a lot to my husband and his unwavering confidence is what’s motivated me to just get every obstacle out of the way... 

Tl;dr: I do but i still have concerns/hesitations but it doesn’t mean I don’t want it. Husband is like 120% in."
127,"Unpopular opinion - I still like Tumblr even since dec 17. The hardcore stuff has gone, but they still allow 'erotica'. It might even be hotter than before. It's sexier. You can get gaping assholes and shit stained balls almost everywhere else on the internet. "
128,Then the only option is to meet friends of friends. Your gay friends will know who's gay and who's straight.

133,^This. 
134,wow. you must really have to go ... 
135,It might be a generational thing. Straight guys today are a lot more chill. If I had done that to one of my fraternity brothers I would have been black-balled

139,"&gt; Prep is very effective but not 100% effective

There have been some case of infection even with prep ? Last time i checked, there was none, but maybe it was just the France numbers ?"
140,"that is good advice, thank you! i think i panic too much, speak too fast and too much about myself. if i show a big interest in him and speak slowly i think that would help a lot"

146,"I love living alone!  I come and go whenever I please.  I do whatever I want.  I can bring home whoever or whatever I want.  I can leave a mess behind.  No judgments.  It is great.  But then I'm an introvert, so I don't really get all that lonely.  I've done it for so long, I don't think I could cope if I had to share my place.  I work nights, and I'm typically the only person there in my team at night.  We don't get time off for a lunch break, so I always plan on eating at my desk.

Having a dog really helps.  There is nothing like coming home to  licky-licks and a wagging tail after a crappy day at work.  Even if I just made a quick trip to the grocery store, he greets me like I've been gone for days.  He is getting older though and leaving him alone while I'm at work is a bit of a concern."
147,This makes no sense whatsoever.
148,"I feel like that's what I've been doing all my life. Being myself, meeting cool people and having amazing friendships. But I just end up developing feelings and getting hurt when it isn't reciprocated. That works great for making new friends, but isn't working for finding something more than that."
149,I beg to differ but go off.
150,"I sure hope it's not, I have seen that"
151,"I would be absolutely apeshit furious. 

I would say ""If she asks I will answer honestly in a manner appropriate for her age."" So if she's 2 and she asks ""who is that?"" I would say something like ""That's Joe."" If she asks why he's there I'd say ""he's with me."" If she asks why he's with me I'd say ""he lives with me, so I bring him with me."" If she asks why, I'd say ""because I want to."" I really doubt it would even get that far. If she's a little older I might say ""that's Joe, my boyfriend."" I really doubt any further questions would be forthcoming, but any answers would be no more explicit than that because I wouldn't give any more explicit answers to an adult for the same questions, and at most I'd end up saying ""I don't think that's an appropriate question to ask,"" or maybe ""you should ask your mom that."" 

And if anybody who knew me well had to ask me what I'd say, I'd be angry that they felt it necessary to ask the question in the first place - they should know me well enough to know I would give appropriate answers - and very angry if they assumed anything I would say would in any way be inappropriate for a child, and utterly furious to the point of leaving and probably not speaking to them again until they apologized if they tried to tell me I had to hide myself in any way from their child. "
152,"Prep is more than 99% effective against HIV if taken daily. I believe there are 6 known cases of HIV infection among people following the regimen correctly. Condoms alone are closer to 92% effective. Prep’s effectiveness does not *approach* that if condoms, it *exceeds* it. "

158,Why ? Don't you want to use condoms ?
159,"I want to adopt. Honestly, not wanting kids is a deal breaker for me. I can compromise on a lot, but I won't on that. I thought about surrogates before, but there's a lot I don't know yet, so right now that's a no. We'll see about in the future. There are just so many babies in the foster system who need loving homes and parents. "
160,"Same here, 40k for the surrogate 30k for the fertility clinic 10k for the surrogate insurance, 10k for our insurance after the kids were deliver. (Their NICU bill was a little over half a million, insurance covered all but 10k) and other miscellaneous charges. All in all we spent a little over 100k. But again it was worth every penny, but if you’re going to do it shoot for twins that way is more “cost effective “"
161,"No idea what that means Tbh, usually if someone is extremely feminine I just count them as gay, everyone else, I wouldn't know. ""Gay vibe"" &lt;---- NO clue what this means at all. "
162,"I love kids and would really like kids - in theory. In practice we just got a dog and, while we love her, I'm already beginning to mourn my ability to control my own time. She barks at 1am and I gotta say, not being able to sleep through the night is *not great*. 

So right now I'm keen on just being a cool gay uncle. "
163,A bottom in disguise. ;)
164,"Dude, wake up. 6 people on thousands (136,000 in the US alone) ! 
And we talk about people who took it daily, probably as a substitute for condom, probably with multiple partners, in a city (san fransisco) with on of the highest hiv prevalence in the western world !

For you we are talking about using prep only for blowjobs ! (that mean using condoms + prep for anal sex).

Chances to have aids threw oral sex : 0.04 %
Chances of non-working prep : 0,00004 % (6 on 136000)
Chance of having a gay partner with HIV in big city : around 15%

So, taking Prep for oral sex means you have 0,000006 % of being infected... If you're still scared, then, therapist is the solution."

169,"Ah yes a safe word is a good idea. I’ll talk to him about that, although aggression isn’t an everyday thing in the bedroom for us. Just sometimes. 

Just to clarify, him leaving a mark wasn’t sexual aggression, it was an accident, but it turned me on to imagine him hitting me really hard"

181,Yes wear a pink triangle. 
182,"Your friend was probably lying to make you feel better.

While it’s true that fem guys are more obviously gay to everyone, any gay man that says he’s never had a crush on a tall, attractive straight guy before is lying. Over 90% of the world is straight, it’s practically guaranteed.

Maybe you’re ugly? If you really wanna know for sure go to a gay bar and see how they react to you there.

*sips spiked tea*"

184,"I want five kids, 3 girls and 2 boys. I've wanted to be a father since I was in my teens.

And I remember being so incredibly happy when I read in 2015 that British scientists have found a way to create egg and sperm cells from skin cells (they revert the skin cells into stem cells, then cultivate them as sperm and egg cells), which meant that many couples who could not traditionally conceive (most prominently, same-sex couples) would be able to use this as a method for conception.

I hope one day I can find a good man to marry and we could save up and use this method (although we could probably only afford it once, since I expect it to be very expensive)."
185,"Lots of possibilities here:
1. You have been hit on but you didn’t notice.
2. Your friend was lying.
3. You’re not around gay men in contexts where they might hit on you enough for it to have happened.
4. You talk so much about women that people take a hint (or are conspicuous about being in a relationship with one).
5. You’re messy in a way gay guys don’t find appealing.

There’s really no way of us knowing, but it could be any number of reasons."

187,"I wouldn't beat yourself up about sharing you have a new boyfriend. It's exciting news, and your parents should've responded way better. 

Yes, learning in less than a month that you are gay and have a boyfriend is a big change for them to absorb.  But that in NO WAY excuses their horrific behavior towards you.  You should expect more from your parents.  "

Bonus points if there's a drag show or something.  You can watch the show, scope out the crowd during it, and then afterwards saunter up to some one else who appears to be in a similar boat to you of probably there alone, attractive, and strike up conversation yourself(!) but you can reference the show y'all just watched as a starting point.  "
193,"I like the comment on making sure you have a back up plan if things don't work out somewhere mid trip. 

However that does imply that you are going. The first question you need to ask is if you are ok with him paying for all that stuff and if you can afford to do something in return if you feel inclined to do so. That is something only you can answer, but based on what you wrote, it seems you are already feeling a bit awkward with it.

Also keep in mind, that him paying for all this stuff is his choice. it in no way means that you need to do something for him, whatever that may be. "
194,We need more tops.
195,"You consider yourself average and are reserved. He's not reserved and in the eyes of his strong affection, you are one of the cutest, hottest guys he's ever seen. That is a plus! It's not disingenuous in his culture. You are right, culture is probably a major factor. He's not like the guys back in the Balkans. You should feel very lucky he adores you so much. However, if he's public affection makes you uncomfortable let him know that in public it embarrasses you and makes you feel bad."
196,"They are not straight but simply testing the waters and then are too afraid to act on it when they get a positive result. If you are interested in them, leave it open so they know you are interested if they ever get the courage to go for it. "
197,"Well, I don't mind going primal from time to time. But not to the point where I'm hitting him to leave black eye.

I like that type of aggression as well, but not exactly towards people I would stick my dick in."
198,"#exactly

I swear to God my conservative friends tend to be more sensitive and tolerant about that aspect of my life because they at least know when to keep their mouths shut and then my liberal friends act like spoiled hateful children when I say not all conservatives are bad.

210,"There is a *small* chance he just doesn't want his friend to know about it and it was fine and he's just a quiet and private person, but the overwhelming likelihood is he didn't have a good time and is avoiding you.  "
211,"Thank you for your input Throwawagae1. It may interest you to know that it's been nine days since we've broken up, and a lot has happened in those nine days. If I'd written this directly after he'd left, it probably wouldn't have sounded as ""cohesive and lyrical."" As I say in the post, ""He leaves, and I go sit on my bed, feeling more numb and empty than I have in as long as I can remember."" Yesterday, I chose to write about how I felt. I spent time trying to express the, the still fresh experience. I'm sorry if you perceive that as being too contrived. This process allowed me to think through every detail of that night, and many details of our relationship, some of which I mention in the post. I cried a lot while writing this; it was a much needed cathartic experience. When you say ""someone who's supposedly a mess from a breakup,"" or ""fic,"" or ""romantic comedy vibe,"" you're insinuating that this isn't real. Looking at my post history, you'll see former posts line up with this post, but often the posts don't form a complete picture. For instance, I posted about our breakup eight months ago. There also was a post called something like ""Will my relationship survive the stress of school."" No helpful advice was given in the comments, but after making the post, my bf and I talked about things, and it was here that he admitted to self sabotaging our relationship to make a breakup inevitable. I reference this in this post as well. My history may not show the full picture of my relationship. It doesn't have to. But it was real, and now it's over. I'm sorry if my grieving process doesn't align with how you think it should look."
212,"If I met up with a guy to hookup and either he smells or his place smells, I’m getting the fuck out of there. I wouldn’t even try to offer a shower. He should have the initiative to CLEAN UP if he’s going to be messing around with someone. Some people are so f’ing nasty.

215,"Thank you for telling us this.   I think it is really important, because I always lived with the assumption that I was ugly.   It took a really good man to break me out of that mindset, and I am eternally grateful for it."
216,"Agreed.  I make sure my place is in great shape, smells nice and I’ve prepped.  I don’t need an odor to kill the mood.  I always ask “are you clean” and I’ve meant that both disease and cleanness.  I always play safe, but a funky guy comes over — aint no amount of shower going to rob me of that first impression."
217,I’d vote for that!
218,"I grew up in the Kingdom Hall, too, but I was fortunate with being blessed with parents who loved me unconditionally and wanted nothing but happiness for me. I knew many kids growing up in the Hall and under strict rules that didnt fare so well.

My husband and I tried the adoption thing 2 times and it didnt work out for us (legal issues), so we kind of gave up on the thoughts of having a child/children. If we were to do it again, we would probably go for private adoption, less paperwork agency involvement. "
219,"Wow man, I hear ya, and could have written that myself word for word. I’ve even tried wearing a ring that has rainbow stones on it just in the hopes that gay dudes may actually pay attention to me instead of instantly writing me off as being straight (doesn’t work haha)."

222,"I'm well hung, so most guys want me to top them. And while I'm vers, I prefer bottoming..."
223,"feel u. one of my main issues when beginning to figure out I was gay was that literally everyone in my life had already made up their minds about my sexuality and was constantly berated afterwards that ""we already knew"". it takes away your power to define yourself and also just how you wanna live and be. being verse (mostly top) myself, it annoys me whenever we are pushed into top or bot roles and all these things connected to them. why can't u be a top, but deeply affectionate and cuddly? I love a good cuddle, damn it."
224,"I’ve never shown, been asked to show, or been shown anyone’s test results. A negative HIV test result only means he was negative 3 months before the test anyway, due to the incubation period. You simply take whatever precautions you’re comfortable with, whether that is prep, condoms, or both. Prep will protect you from HIV better than condo s will, but it will not protect against other STIs, mist of which condoms will offer some degree of protection. However, most of these others also spread easily through oral sex, no matter if giving or receiving. "

233,Xtube has a lot of people making some money selling their amateur vids. 
234,"I want to second this. Come out to him, and see if his behavior changes in any way. If he ceases all this activity, it's probably because he doesn't want to lead you on. If it increases, it's because he knows he has a shot with you now. If it stays the same, then well, we'll cross that bridge when we get there! "
235,Tumblr is dead. They just haven't realized it. 
236,"Casual sex made me question my self worth and if people were only interested in me for my appearance or my dick. I almost consistently felt devalued either during, or after the act of casual sex or hooking up. A few times I questioned: ""Why am I doing this?"" while getting railed by some dude I didn't find quite as attractive in person as I did in his photos on grindr. Casual sex also carries with it the innate risk of STDs or the risk that whoever you're hooking up with could turn out to be a total loon - that has happened to me too. 

I'm glad you find value in it but it's definitely not for everyone and I'd encourage people who find happiness in casual encounters to broaden their horizons a bit and try and find value in things beside what they have to offer the world on a sexual level."
237,Do you want to do this? 
238,"I definitely want kids, and my plan is to adopt. I think I’d feel selfish doing surrogacy - which takes more money and effort - when there are already children born into the world who need loving families. "
239,"I really don't, but it's common for people to decide based on my color what they want to see me as.

The more they do it the more I talk about what I know about my dad's heritage.  He immigrated here legally alone as an adult, I'm the first generation American on his side."
240,"No I know for sure.

I agree with the liberal mindset almost exclusively for social issues but I swear some of my friends can be so closed minded and awful and they just say nasty generalizing things and then accuse conservatives of being that way.  But it isn't true.  Conservatives just don't believe in most of the hot button social issues liberals do.  Which makes me mad sure, but when there's a double standard in play that makes me mad too."
241,Owning and being proud of your sexuality is an important step to being happy and confident. That could mean very different things to different people. There’s no reason to be ashamed in being sexually adventurous if that’s who you are.
242,So what's the question again? 
243,"Yeah. I wouldn’t put my name, face and foreskin on the internet for god and the world to see. That might just be me. Call me old fashioned. 

And there are so many dudes on here thinking about doing porn. Cannot understand it. "
244,Propose and got shopping together. That’s a thing too. 
245,Yeah I’ve been sort of dating the person for a couple of months. So there is some weight to my feelings but I’m not sure if they’re justified. 
246,Use it as lube? 
247,"I've had this internal debate with myself for years.  

Morally I would rather adopt, there are kids out there who need parents. Although the qualifier here is that there is *huge* competition to adopt babies. Those kids *will* be adopted anyway, most of the time you're not really saving a kid from care by adopting just after birth. And I'm not sure if I'd have the skills to adopt a child at an older age as my first kid.

However, I'm a biologist.  And there's a part of my brain that thinks about how I'm the result of an incredible, unbroken string of billions of years of lifeforms successfully passing on their genes.  I know it means nothing in real life terms, but do I want to be the end of that string? I don't think I do.

Financial reality then comes into it as well.  Surrogacy is *insanely* expensive. I think I'd only be able to/would want to attempt it if one of my female friends offered to carry it. This means if the child is a girl, she would in a way have a mother to teach her things I as a man don't know about.

I think it's a really complicated and very personal decision to make, so I try not to judge other peoples choices too harshly.

A friend of a friend got my number and texted me lots after we first met, but on that first meeting he was staying over my friend's place and did not have the foresight to bring a toothbrush.

His breath was repulsive in the morning (fair enough) and I just couldn't get that lasting impression out of my head.

255,"I have no idea what you mean by hiv certification? As in a negative test result? People don’t just carry that around generally. I’m just saying to use a condom if you’re worried and not to trust random guys you meet. 

Yes, I have. That’s why I’m saying to treat everyone as if they’re positive and practice safer sex. "

257,"I was a trainee engineer in a big production plant for four months.

258,"Haha. I had a gay neighbor who always offered and finally took him up on it and realized nothing about it was weird or felt wrong or anything and that I really enjoyed it. But I also still enjoyed sex with women. After awhile I just decided I was I mostly interested in relationships with women, but open to sex with either. So I guess that made me bi. "
259,I mean Overwatch's Soldier 76 was just revealed to be gay. Heavily masculine. Past with a leadership role. Acting as a vigilante. And a grumpy/sexy daddy. Reflective but not entirely defined by past romance. If anything this is the variety in character I think we should urge more for.

270,My mom’s friend’s son smelled like shit and left a strong shit odor wherever he sat and I asked him if he cleans his ass and he says no because it’s “gay” and his ass shouldn’t be touched... it sounds like he doesn’t even wipe after shutting...
271,"thank you lets hope so, (weird that this situation is a win for me at this point). I will let people know of any updates"
272,What is the adoption process like?
273,I know I’m new but I am so attracted to feminine men.
274,"Keep us updated! I’d guess that you’ll probably be fine, don’t kill yourself worrying about! 

*sips fine wine*"
275,FetLife might work too
276,"This is subjective.  What you consider smelling good might be someone else’s smelling bad. If you don’t synch with someone, you don’t go further. Period. 

Personally, I don’t like BO but I also don’t like guys who smell like deodorant or cheap commercial soap. For me, you’d better smell like straight after a workout or a really good cologne. We all have our preferences. 

What I really hate is guys who demand that you change to suit them, whether it’s scent, clothes, or what-have-you. "
277,"8"" is fine... if they're hot."
278,Damn. My 1000 followers are waiting and I have no clue where to move my blog.
279,thanks I will try but I'm predisposed to worry let alone when there is something legitimate to worry about. Do you know of websites where these things are shared?  
280,"Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. I think if I settled down with someone and got married I would if they did too. In my current situation I couldn't afford one as well. I'd need to have a higher paying job which realistically won't happen for another year or two... Who knows what the future holds though"
281,"Selfish, no.  But it's a lot to ask and there are kids that need homes out there.  But it's not wrong or selfish to want your own kids."
282,"Gurl, delete that shit. "
283,"When I was on Grindr and underage, I used body shots only and saved face pics for only before we met. I never had an issue with getting reported, but I probably had selection bias in my target demographic."
284,But....But... Their momma said...
285,Yea man I'm just going to have to disagree.
286,Do you guys fight over cleanliness? If yes how you deal with it?
287,"Has a functioning replacement to tumblr emerged yet? I heard people talk about cumblr or other sites, but didn't know if they were up and running yet."
288,I had a girlfriend for a couple of weeks. My first relationship ever! When we got to the intimate part my body didn't agree with me. It wasn't gross or anything it just didn't feel right at the time. She was pretty nasty about it and verbally attacked me before breaking up with me. Dunno if that counts though as I didn't even know I was gay at the time 
289,Weird kink but okay
290,Chocolate for me
291,No
292,Ew
293,pretty much the same deal with gays and open relationships.  Dude wanna sleep around with more than one partner.  
294,Not a fan
295,Never. I like my DINK life 
296,being open about your feelings is good though! i'd be a lot more at ease if this guy told me he was nervous too. even if that guy is just trying to make you feel better he's still being nice which is a good sign 
297,Or at least more than one sexual partner.
298,"I think people should be allowed if that want, and no one is abused or used like I see in many of these kinds of things. I personally would never cause I just don't see how you could truly love multiple people the same way you could focus your love on one person but that's just me."
299,And my point still stands. Culture of degeneracy and selfishness. 
300,"Nothing rare about what you feel OP. 

I'm bi, having been in both straight and gay relationships. I do not like excessive public affection, and do not like pet names around others. I'm public I am more reserved and subtle. That might change in private, where we take off clothes and cuddle on the couch.

Theres nothing wrong with hownyoubfeek, but there are also some guys who want to show you off to the world. nothing wrong with that either. Yiur boyfriend is worried that you not wanting PDA means you might not like him. You need to talk to him seriously about this."
301,I heard pornhub has a feed feature where people can post pics videos and stuff similar to tumblr 
302,You do know... there’s more to life than having kids right?
303,I have muscle and a deep voice. Always expected to be a dom top lol
304,Yea 
305,"Oh extremely, if your not young and good looking, good luck the rest of the gays will shun you  "
306,Any thing related to bi shit 
307,He happened to be big 
308,Preach 
309,Cock
310,No guy has done it with me even when I begged...
311,RIP to this guy’s reputation 
312,"I was petty and sent him a 2am text saying this needs to end. He messaged in the am saying “was thinking the same thing. Cool”. 

The part that bothers me most is he’s always the one to start the we could be more chatter. I want 2019 to be the year we never see each other but unsure how or how to steer the ship in that direction. "
313,Having a big ass family that has plenty of big ass gatherings/parties. Also piñatas full of candy! They’re what every kid (and adults let’s be real) look forward to.
314,"Well, I could blame my father for his part in putting me on this bitch of an Earth. "
315,Really missed an opportunity here to call it cumblr
316,"I have a bad case of pee shy. I don't know what's a matter with me since I wasn't always like this, but I cannot pee around other people even if I have a full bladder. I always go for the stalls. "
317,Exhibition Queen
318,If he's *that* bad at communicating then I think you should lay it to rest and find another guy
