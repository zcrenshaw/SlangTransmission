0,"Yes, primarily because of honesty. If you're talking about dating in a long-term relationship sense you're both going to want to have all of the cards on the table to determine if you're going to be compatible. Sexual compatibility is only one factor at play here and this isn't strictly limited to trans people. If a potential date is very religious for example, or has a ton of debt, or an auto-immune disorder, or even hates outdoors physical activities - any of those could be deal-breakers. By being open at the beginning, both parties save themselves time and considering how trans people are often at risk, probably keep them safer as well. "
1,"I‚Äôm not your buddy, friend."
2,Your totally right. Thanks for your honesty. I'll try to keep that in mind. Guess I'm just one of those people that falls a little too easy.
3,"Less judgmentalism. Gay men can be just as judgmental as the ""religious right"", only on different topics. "
4,Well then don‚Äôt do it again. If you do it again maybe take a self audit and realize what it is you want from life. You‚Äôve gotta do what makes ya happy bud. 
5,"Life is short brah, don‚Äôt insist it has to be perfect, work with what you have. "
6,"Every person is different, but for me no. Some cheat because they have the distance. 

I could not be in a relationship with someone and have our main interactions being through calls, video etc. I would like to see the person as well. Speaking of seeing the person, I would also like to hold my SO, kiss them etc. Both which long distances can't happen. I know that you can see each other once in a while whether it once month or even less than that but for me that wouldn't be enough for me.

8,"I think it really depends.   What if it‚Äôs a trans man pre-OP?  I think it should be disclosed before having any sex stuff happen, no?

I have a question for you now.   You meet an amazing guy.  Said guy is on HRT, but still presented as male &amp; had no plans to socially transition as a woman.

But, he decided to keep it from you while dating.  Then the clothes come off, and things are a bit different than you‚Äôd expect.   

Dealbreaker?
"
9,"""hi i dont like u any more ok bye love you"""
10,"I think yes. I want to know what I‚Äôm getting myself into. That and if anyone lies to me and expects a relationship to be formed, then they have no idea who they‚Äôre dealing with. Don‚Äôt lie or give false expectations. This applies irrespective of your gender etc. Don‚Äôt build relationships on iffy foundations. Just tell them, get it out of the way, then move on to evaluate your options. "
11,"Doesn't that invalidate the whole idea of inflexibility of sexual orientation? It suggests that gay men could turn straight with some hormone therapy and exploring their desires for women. I'm not saying that's your argument, by any means, not trying to put words into your mouth. I'm just not able to make sense of it, I guess."
12,"If they dont want anyone else involved, yes they are asexuals.

It's a spectrum, like sexuality in general"
13,"I would say most gay guys aren't super flaming, but are still slightly effeminate. It's usually their their facial features, female friends, slight lisps, and interests that give them away. "
14,I love these posts
15,Yaaaaasssss
16,"Why would you attack me like this? This was exactly the problem why i almost failed gym. Tbh it was less about being body concious &amp; more about my aversion to super masculine guys in that environment as well as being sweaty for other periods because we didnt have time to shower

Funny because the 1 time i did change to actually do gym some guy told me i was sexy &amp; tried to push up on me"
17,"I think a relationship should be based on honesty, so coming out should matter and be tied to mutual sharing. "
18,This is lying by omission.
19,"I didn't hate it but it was stressful because I was always worried I'd get caught checking out the cocks.

I sat in the same area as all the black guys (on purpose) and just enjoyed the smells and the view. I was always the last to finish dressing. Lol"
20,"As one¬†asexual¬†put it, ‚Äúeverything works, we just don't want to get somebody else involved.‚Äù Tellingly, most¬†asexuals¬†who¬†masturbate¬†say they rarely think about another person during the act, and even when they¬†do, it's in a non-sexual context"
21,"Mutual decision. When he said that at 38, he'd finally found the guy he could imagine marrying in me, yet we were totally incompatible in soooo many ways, we both decided it was time to call it quits. I'm pretty analytical, and communication is important to me. He's literally a slob- like, buys new clothing before he would wash. He also was a recreational drug user, and very heavy drinker, where I'm neither due to trauma growing up relating to adult drug and alcohol abuse. And he refuses to talk about problems, where I can't just gloss things over or ignore them.

Really sucked, because for both of us, it was the best sex we'd ever experienced, and neither of us are anywhere close to virgins, lol."

28,"Trans man here. This isn't something I've experienced personally, but it's actually very common for guys to become interested in men when they start hormone therapy. I'm not sure whether there's a biochemical aspect to it, but for a lot of them it's that they just couldn't imagine being with men sexually ""as a woman."" 

Once they're on hormone therapy for a while and more comfortable with their bodies, they're more comfortable exploring their desires for men. "

36,"Awh, I'm sorry :(

I think it just may be my nerves.. but I'm not sure lol the distance scares me üòÇ"
37,"1) Not really, no.  Spares you both a bunch of awkward small talk if your goal is to hit on the guy.  If you see that he's on grindr then he's at least family and looking to a small extent.  Personally I'd then put the phone away and go up in person and *then* make some small talk instead of opting to inferface via the app when he's 10 feet away from you.

2) Yeah, that'd make me uncomfortable too.  Usually straight dudes don't like when the ""lockerroom talk"" is about them.  I think it's fine to talk about dates or stuff, but to make remarks about ""that hot dude doing bench press when we got here"" is reminding them of an uncomfortable fact.  It's a doublestandard since two straight bros could do that about some gym bunny and all the other guys in the sauna would be okay with it, but oh well.  "

But it was the worst of the worst for liars, trolls, and people simply just not mainstream or normal. There is a reason so many in the gay world ridicule it. What made me decide to stop and delete was the fact that more than one person had a hard time taking ""no"" after reaching out.

I'm not sure why you think only honest and sincere people are using the app. It only takes one to be pissed at you and to reuse your image. And if the digital age is famous for anything, it's easy use and reuse of digital content. Including your images. "

But it's a part of closeted life, and it's never going to not be awkward for you. Sorry. "
78,Sometimes the truth ain‚Äôt pretty
79,"There's a lot to unpack here, so let's start with... 

His fetish. Diapers are a particularly hard fetish to work with when one partner isn't into it because of the taboo behind it. Those who aren't into it are usually *really* not into it. It says a lot of positive things about your relationship that you were willing to try wearing for him and that your relationship is still functioning despite the revelation. Gold star. That's a rare occurrence in the community. 

That said, your fears of including it causing him to require it to perform is entirely valid. Well, possibly. It's the same as it is with any specific kind of sex act: if you only get off to leather bondage for a long time, for example, your brain starts to link the two and it becomes harder to be sexually aroused without it. That can just as easily with diapers. Engaging in fetishes like this is similar to watching porn in that aspect; it can alter the way your brain views sex. 

&gt;Part of me feels like I could enjoy him romantically for the rest of my life without even indulging sexually if that's whats needed. Part of me feels like I'm cheating us both from better more fitting partners. 

This is the part I'd like to talk about the most. 

The thing is that you may be right. It's possible that there's someone who better fits what both you and he want out there... but that can be said for just about any couple. In this case, you are definitely good for him but *maybe* he isn't good for you. 

To touch on that point further, relationships where a partner who has a diaper fetish is accepted for who they are and what they like are very rare. As I said earlier, the taboo is strong with this link. What you're doing for him by simply accepting him, much less allowing to engage this, is invaluable. You're one in a million, kid. You're understanding and caring and loving, so much so that you're worrying about his needs as well as your own. Another gold star. 

But are you actually happy enough with him that you could really forego sex and maintain a romantic relationship? That's the key statement in your post to me. I don't ask because I believe that's the road you're headed down, but because I think people say things like when they don't really mean them. Does he make you that happy? 

If he really makes you that happy then your final statement isn't really relevant. The likelihood of him finding someone who accepts this side of him is slim. The odds of you finding someone you could easily give up sex for is also slim. That's a strong bond that's worth saving, whether that means keeping an open relationship and doing what you're currently doing or trying to work out the kinks (heh) in your own sex life. 

My advice would be to sit down and talk about everything you've said here. Have an open dialogue about what you both want, what you both need, and how you can work towards that. ***Be completely open about his fetish is affecting your thoughts about the relationship.*** Have a solid plan for what you're going to do to help each other feel fulfilled. Just... talk. Long and hard. "

Other than that, guys who take themselves and sex too seriously is a big turnoff. If the other person will freak out if someone farts or whatever. Sex isn't porn and being with someone that's just trying to reenact their favorite scene isn't worth it."

92,"&gt;and were not about a bunch of dumb college kids being dumb.

You should give some of the newer movies from the last 10-15 years a chance then. Slasher flicks where it's just about teens getting killed kinda died out like 10 years ago. A lot of horror now is realizing it needs the substance, suspense, and actual character/plot again. The Conjuring, IT, Babadook, Hereditary, The With, The Haunting of Hill House and a bunch of others like that are really good and basically are dramas trojan horsing as a horror."
93,"I agree, this is what I've been thinking too, and I can appreciate that. I don't want to ever make him feel like he's out of place or bothersome for how he identifies sexually but I know there's more to him than just his sexuality, I wish he'd engage that part of his personality more. "

It gets easier though."
95,"Just go for it.  Trust me, a boner isn‚Äôt  going to happen unless you want it to.  And as far as public ridicule, who cares?  If you are comfortable then it‚Äôs fine.  If someone else has a problem with it that‚Äôs on them.   "

101,"it all depends on a bunch of things: 

- do you have insurance? if you do, your policy governs how much you'll pay for the three different parts: the quarterly physician visits, the quarterly lab work, and the truvada itself. 
- the gilead copay card covers the copay part of your prescription cost, often reducing it to $0
- kaiser is pretty informed. however, if you're at kaiser you should know that their pharmacies don't accept the gilead copay card and you have to send your receipt in to gilead for reimbursement. 
- if you're a minor then whether your parents will find out may depend on the laws in your state. most states protect minors (often over a certain age) from their parents when it comes to these things, but some states don't. if you're an adult and you're just on your parents insurance until you're not a student anymore then the likelihood of being outed to your parents is smaller (just make sure that you get your correspondence online through kaiser's portal). 

if you're in a big city it may be easier to go to a clinic that specializes in this (like [strut](https://www.strutsf.org/) in san francisco) ... they'll have the resources to make this all free or very low cost without hitting your insurance and informing your parents. "

I can‚Äôt tell you how I personally have found a way to cope, but I have studied a lot about how others seem to. First off, the existentialists and Buddhists are right that the core component of life is suffering. No matter how lucky your birth, we all age and get sick and die and watch the same happen to loved ones. Given that life is inherently tragic, hedonism or happiness really isn‚Äôt an appropriate or even achievable goal. A better one might be the focus on meaning and a purpose to endure those slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. Meaning seems to be tied intrinsically to responsibility and shouldering the most important and heavy burden we can manage. One can find that place to rise to by bringing order and stability to the smallest parts of the world around us and expanding it more are more as we master the prior spheres until we find something worthy of our effort that truly engages and uplifts. I certainly can‚Äôt say what that means for you as I haven‚Äôt found it for myself, but it seems to be true for a great many people. "

138,"I have sleeping problems (I am European so now it is normally time to sleep, but I can't right now). 

To answer your question, sleeping pills can be a solution, but a temporary one, and it should mostly be a derogatory one. Sleeping pills won't give you a ""quality sleep"", you basically drug your body to sleep, but if you really really need them to sleep, you can.
I strongly advise you to tell your doctor first about your sleeping issues so that he can trace its source though, since it may be connected to a change occurring in your body or something that affects you mentally, . 
Then, should you not find other solutions, you can get sleeping pills. Sometimes, common remedies and therapy can help you more efficiently than sleeping pills. 

Since when do you have a hard time sleeping ?

Try using your other hand to touch another part of your body. When you find something that feels good, don't work toward an orgasm, just relax and keep feeling good. If you go 30-40 minutes of feeling good, it's better than stopping because you didn't shoot. Keep trying different things. Try different lubrication. Maybe Vaseline is too viscous. Experiment with new sensations and feeling good and hopefully, feeling better. The climax will happen, believe me."

159,I LITERALLY start uncontrollably shaking and convulsing and have a panic attack at the thought that homophobia will always exist and I‚Äôll have to deal with it no matter what. I literally would rather kill my self than accept that as reality. I mean it. I straight up reject that notion. I have no choice but to. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this type of reaction if it keeps me alive.
160,"Its never for no Reason. But I like my emotions. I have been binge watching One Piece. Its a great anime but damn there are some parts that i just bawled my eyes out. Trying to do this without spoilers.  But a character died. And there was all these flashback to them being a kid. Their parents had died so this one woman was asked to raise the boy by a friend and someone high up in the military. During a war, much later.  The kid, now an adult was killed, It was sad. But that scene where the woman who raised him confronted the military friend. She is drunk off her ass. Knocks him down with one punch. Then gets on top of him and repeated punching him in the face yelling. ""I raised him as my son you bastard, you were right there, you could of saved his life, he looked up to you. And you let him die, what kind of man puts his career above his own family. Why did you have me raise him if you were just going to let him die."" "
161,Pooh buddy doo ba bahhhhh bear
162,Yes. They do. Get off the apps. Go out to meet guys. Join a gay club or sports league. It‚Äôs mainly the apps. They are pretty destructive to our community at this point. I know they won‚Äôt go away but I think we all need to take a step back and reevaluate their purpose and how we use them 
163,"Slang, yes, but I wouldn‚Äôt complain if you‚Äôd meant ‚Äòwrestling‚Äô singlet now either :)"
164,"What makes you think they are being fake? 

I guess you should try to figure out why hurt you have this default sense of mistrust for everyone? "
165,"But gay dudes suppress their homosexual desires because of societal pressure. Would a lesbian (following the Zeke Smith example) suppress her desire for men (but in which no societal pressure against a woman desiring a man exists) and then, after treating his gender dysphoria, as a trans man (and only then as a trans man and not as a woman) express this desire for men?"
166,"&gt;I often feel very embarrassed to tell other gay guys because they can't keep from expressing their surprise at such a thing

then don't? it's not like every conversation dwelves on how many times have you had anal sex"

Be a strong fa**ot, and don't embrace the stereotype of weak crying LGBTQ human being !! I am bisexual, i am what a I am, and there's no need to be upset against an homophobe !! Don't waste your time..."
174,"It's now very common to hear people say, 'I'm rather offended by that.' As if that gives them certain rights. It's actually nothing more... than a whine. 'I find that offensive.' It has no meaning; it has no purpose; it has no reason to be respected as a phrase. 'I am offended by that.' Well, so fucking what.

183,"I didn't just hate it. I dreaded it. I'd act out in math class just so I would be sent to the principal's office right before gym almost every day. It was really bad for my mental health.

I ended up really internalizing this fear of nudity (or even near-nudity), and I spent the next fifteen years or so pretty much completely avoiding any situation where someone else might see more of my skin than my face, neck, hands, or arms. I would wear long pants in the summer just so people couldn't see up my shorts if, for instance, they happened to look up as I walking up a staircase. It was really, really, damaging to my self esteem.

It also made me completely separate myself from the world of sports. Anything involving physical activity was avoided at all costs. I didn't even like watching sports on TV, or talking about it with my friends, because of this deep-rooted shame.

I'm 30 years old now, and I came out of the closet five years ago. Throughout my 20s, I slowly started wearing shorts more often. I allowed myself to play dodgeball with some friends on Sunday afternoons a couple years ago. And a few months ago, I finally bit the bullet and started going to the gym before work every day with one of my friends. I change my clothes in the locker room before and after. And the piece that I'm most proud of is that I'm even showering, fully nude, in the open showers. Usually I'm completely alone in the showers, but not always - and while I'm still super uncomfortable in there, I'm definitely getting over it with time."
184,Lol what? 
185,"Thanks for the advice. I am definitely overdue for a trip to the doctor. I'm 30 and workout 3-5 times a week, but I wouldn't really consider myself a healthy individual, overall."

188,"I thought it was cock-shirter, lol. "
189,"So much can change in a year! This will sound corny but you seriously just have to believe in yourself. I was stuck in a job I hated for four years. There was no real career advancement and I was constantly depressed about how my life was ending up. Within just one year, I worked super hard to learn a new skill and landed a job that I love. The whole time I just had unshakeable belief in my own ability to change. 

32 is still young! Don't like your body? Start jogging, doing push ups, or go to the gym if you have the finances. Losing your hair, listen dude I can tell you there's no coming back from that so get a buzz cut and move on. Best decision I made about my balding insecurities. If you think you're ugly, there are things you can do like experimenting with facial hair, buying clothes that fit your body, etc. Your face won't change but you will be happy with the changes. Ok what I'm getting at is unless you are suffering from debilitating depression or some other psychological blocker, you can actually turn this shit around in a year if you really wanted to. I did it and I thought I was hopeless for a while. The hardest part is starting. I saw just pick one thing to work on and starting this weekend, do something about it. "

195,"I hooked up with a daddy one time who was probably over 60. He was soft at times, I was kinda offended lol. Now, it makes sense lol."
196,"I can empathize with you because I was once in a similar situation. It's not easy at first, but accepting who I am was definitely one of the best things I could have ever done for myself, and I wish you the best of luck coming to terms with everything too."
197,"this is a fair list, I can tell you‚Äôve thought a lot about it, but I bet  you can handle it all. 

the thing is, we all have a tendency to notice (and exaggerate/dwell on) the things we don‚Äôt like about ourselves. 

you cant see it now, but you‚Äôre still a youngster with lots of time and opportunities ahead of you. 

since you‚Äôve already got your ‚Äòneg‚Äô list down, get a blank page and try to notice the things that you‚Äôve got going for you, ie count your blessings. 

might sound cheesy but it can really inspire gratitude and inspire change.  start each day noticing all the good in your life, tend to them like a garden. it will help you as you take steps to change some of the things you don‚Äôt like so much. 

good luck brother, you got this "
198,"Trans people are not obligated to share their transition with anybody they have no emotional or physical relationship with. HOWEVER when they are dating/hooking up/developing a connection with someone, they should absolutely be transparent and make their potential mate aware of their gender adjustment so things are clear in the beginning.

201,"it's less self loathing and more about not wanting to be associated with what someone else might consider as ""the gays"".  

Saying ""I'm into dudes"" is how I come out 95% of the time; I want it to be seen as one aspect about me, rather than a full on label and identity.  See also: I'm from the United States vs I'm an American."

A transman simply cannot provide that.  They can come close but while dating/LTR it's going to be a concession on my part.  And, to be fair, there are a bunch of cisgendered men who *also* can't do that for a variety of physiological or psychological quirks."

223,How many guys have dumped you that you believe you have a big enough sample size to declare that this is a gay guy thing? Sounds like you are just whining that you got dumped.

226,"I only wish I had a dollar for every straight man who ""let the faggot suck his cock"".  Straight men have been having sex with other men for centuries in their respective military services, and prison, and just to get off with a convenient orifice.  

To my understanding the more useful dichotomy is to think in terms of straight and gay.  Who do you fall in love with?  I know loads of gay men who have had sex with women.  It did not make them the least bit straight, or bi.  They only fall in love with men.  In the military I knew of many straight guys who ""let the gay suck his cock"", when no women were available.  They were just young and horny.  Thats all."

Almost all my friends over the last thirty years have been gays who were also in long term relationships.  We are out here in large numbers.  So much depends on where you are looking.

My profession caused me to live in ten different cities over the years.  Through all those cities I linked up with gay friendly churches and gay oriented charities.  I got involved, volunteered, and made friends.  Then I made friends with their friends.  My committed loves emerged from those associations, as did those of my associates.  This sure worked for us."

238,That‚Äôs really interesting. Did you always want to do that?
239,This.
240,The men who have had sex with men for centuries are gay or bisexual.
241,The point is.....Why chase men who do not want you?  That's disrespectful and harassment.  If gay men want people to respect that they are gay and not into men.  Then do the same for straight men.  They are not into men.  They only want women.  You are the reason straight men don't like gay men.
242,"Define older horror movies. I definitely prefer movies from the early 2000s and a bit after. Hated the shaky cam, ‚Äúbased on true events‚Äù shit that came around the 2010s like Paranormal Activity and The Conjuring. Those were absolute garbage in my book."

They get upset when they spend a bunch of time on you, and then find out you are not what you put in the store window.  When you are honest with yourself, and put it right out there, those who would like it can see it, and move closer."
275,"I strongly urge you to avoid the apps until you have all this worked out.  Have you thought of getting involved with gay friendly churches, and gay oriented charities?  Find places where you can go join in doing something good and wholesome, and just make friends.  Then make friends with their friends.  

Let sex issue from your finding a man you truly admire and respect, and who treats you with manners and regard.  Let this emerge from a healthy circle of gay friends.  This approach will not only lead to what is real and meaningful, but it will also lead to the best sex a man can ever find in this world."
276,"This instructive moment may have come along at just the right time.  Scientists are warning that syphilis and many other sexual diseases are growing in resistance.  They foresee incurable strains in our immediate future.  Strains that will pass orally, and in skin to skin contact.

There is a reason that every authority on earth concerning sexual diseases advocates, ""extreme selectivity of choice, followed by rigorous safety procedures""."
277,"Yeah, that's not happening.

There are no examples of that happening. It has not happened to you or to anyone you know.

I actually am going to give you the credit of believing you aren't actually stupid enough to believe that.

So in the spirit of that generosity: Fuck off you wank stain of a troll."
278,"Yeah once I find out a guy is straight my interest drops to zero. Not sure why people enjoy them, though I don't judge. People like what they like. I have a feeling it's a masculinity thing, but if it is, there are plenty of gay/bi guys that are plenty manly enough. I also feel it could be the forbidden fruit aspect but I don't get this one either. I HATE being teased and I hate when things are dangling in my face that I know I won't get (heh...).

Idk. They're a thing because people enjoy it. More power to them, but it's not my thing. Gimme my gay/bi dudes and let the others keep the straights."

287,"So I get your frustration. It is wrong to call someone those things, especially if the reason is to cause harm or distress. However, you can't control other people. The best you can do is try to educate them, but even here, if someone is screaming slurs at you, they're likely not a good candidate for a thoughtful conversation. You have to learn that the world is mostly shit. Sure, there's beauty in it but it doesn't outweigh the shit.

&amp;#x200B;

It's important to maintain control of yourself and realize that comments like that likely won't matter in the long run. It's not even about ""being the bigger people."" It's about dealing with this shitty world. Just like you can't expect a hurricane to tiptoe around a city, you can't expect ignorant people to respect your feelings."
288,"Not to be rude but... ARE you relationship material? A good relationship is founded on a strength of spirit, willingness to compromise, and charity with friends and loved ones. If you are the type to hold grudges, be resentful, or not communicate you may want to work on those and see if you attract people that way. "
289,"My ass, or eyes. Whichever they look at first."
