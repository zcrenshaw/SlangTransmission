0,I have now heard it all. 
1,Or kick him off because that‚Äôs your apartment and he is being an inconsiderate cunt. 
2,"I watched it for 6 years thinking hmn I wanna feel encouraged to have such a nice body. And now I'm like nah, I just wanna fuck him."
3,It is your body and your responsibility to protect it the best you can so I suggest you tell anyone who wants have sex with you that it's your way or not at all
4,You are so brave to share your story üò¢
5,"""I'm sorry - I was being polite but you're not hearing my meaning.   I'm not asking you to leave for 2 hours, I'm telling you that I need the apartment to myself for 2 hours and you are expected and required to go elsewhere.  I was asking you to make it sound amiable, but this is not optional.   You may come back after 11 pm.""  "
6,"You're not gonna get good responses here because a lot of people seem to think bare back is okay now that PREP exists. One of the reasons I only look for masturbation buddies is because I don't trust people on Grindr/Growlr/etc for anything more. I don't see how people are so comfortable fucking people with no condom, especially if someone has a fetish for being fucked anonymously. Atop that, I can easily lie and say I'm on PREP/PEP or that I'm HIV-. It's not worth the risk for that 1 nut."
7,"No for two reasons: 

1) he probably is straight - It's just 9/10 likely so. 

2) if he is straight, you never know what kind of reaction you will get (esp. depending on where you are). It can range from non-nonchalant to literally dangerous. "
8,"That was me as a teen, I didn't think about it too much just was horny, got gay porn and got off. I was like ya I'm totally straight it's just porn, not like I'm actually doing gay stuff lmao. Now I'm doing the gay stuff lol."
9,"That sounds like an awesome superhero. 

For me, it was just daddy. This twink was rubbing his hands through my chest hair in the shower after we'd just fucked, and he's looking at his hands slide through the hair, then look's me dead in the eyes and says ""You'll look so much hotter when this starts going grey.""

I literally said ""I'm not sure that was a compliment."" He told me not to worry about it.

I told my friends and they fucking shit themselves laughing. Now I can't live that down. They call me daddy for no reason sometimes.

Moral of the story: never tell your friends shit. "
10,I assume he‚Äôs straight.  This is why I would rely on dating apps or bars.  
11,"Ew no, random male conventionally attractive celebrity has really specific completely minor and unimportant trait that makes him completely unfuckable and anyone who thinks otherwise must like ugly guys."
12,"Maybe the reason you're not horny anymore is because you masturbate out of boredom regularly.

Allow some time between each session ;)"
13,Congrats. Your copy of the gay agenda will be in the mail in 3-5 business days. 
14,"Tell him you thought he was gay for a long time, that you thought he was in a relationship with one of his guy friends "
15,"Just... move on with your life, find somebody else.

It will hurt and you can't do anything about it. You can't force anyone to love you."
16,"It could be so much worse. There was a thread earlier about a dad blackmailing his son, threatening him, and cutting off his college fund once he found out about his gay ho activities. Snooping isn‚Äôt cool; but after that thread, ur dad doesn‚Äôt sound so bad. "
17,Also. Jacking off with a buddy is way underrated. No condoms required!
18,Glanced in a shirtless jogger‚Äôs general direction 
19,"I've been called the n-word by a white dude (i am half puerto rican and half german, and barely even brown)

I called him colonizer and he didn't finish lol"
20,"Cute waiter: More coffee?  
Me: No, I'm fine.  
Waiter (without missing a beat): You sure are, sir.

My date was not amused.

EDIT: Good lord, how is this my most upvoted comment ever."
21,Don't do it. Its her day.
22,I disagree and think lowly of him as a person because he is popular and not even that great at the thing he is popular for.
23,"I used to go to this spin studio twice a month, and could kinda tell the guy who worked the front desk was feeling it. Once, after class, I couldn‚Äôt get into my locker, so I asked him to open it for me. He came over, and turns out I was trying to open the wrong locker ‚Äî The one with all my stuff was one to the left. I chuckled and said, ‚ÄúWell, this is embarrassing.‚Äù And he replied, ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, you‚Äôre pretty ‚Äî you don‚Äôt have to be smart.‚Äù I SUPER nervous laughed and didn‚Äôt know how to reply but was flattered that he called me attractive

Until 2 minutes later when I realized that he had also called me dumb :("
24,"God, of course you're in shock. Two fucking years. That is a just awful. Sorry for saying this, but your BF is a complete asshole. 

But, hey, don't worry. He'll get back together with his ex, and then they will break up six months from now. This is what happens to assholes. Mark my words. 


I hope you'll have the sense to reject him then.
"
25,Okay daddy
26,"Hahaha it's truly amazing seeing somebody else who used the same rationalization. Yes, I keep jerking off to these photos of bodybuilders because I'm jealous not gay!"
27,"It might be that your friendship with him meant the most to him out of your group, and so in his mind, he was saving the most difficult person till last.

As someone has already said, when you're in the closet, you are clouded with fear and indecision, and you make up scenarios in your head of how things are going to go.

Obviously it bothers you, so I would have a casual chat with him and make sure he understands that you wished he had told you sooner as you could have given him the support he needed etc."
28,Dont worry hes probably straight.
29,"‚ÄúOn nodding terms‚Äù I love that haha

Good luck! "
30,"My complete lack of interest in girls. My mother first thought that I was feigning disinterest when she asked if I liked so-and-so, cause most teenage boys don't like their mothers asking about their romantic lives, but she soon realized that I really didn't have any interest whatsoever in women."
31,The absolute worst reason to move out is that you're worried guys won't like it. It's too big a decision for it to be based on the opinions of people you probably won't know in 10 years.
32,That's some late stage capitalism right there
33,"If he's big, muscular, beardy, has a giant ass, and lots of tattoos, and walks around with a dog - he's probably gay.

If he is a flight attendant - he's probably gay.

If he looks like Adam Rippon - he's probably gay.

If he walks like he's walking down a runway - he's probably gay."
34,"No, Grandma, I don't have a girlfriend yet."
35,Feels like a power thing. He probably just enjoys knowing he turns you on while he feels nothing and you can‚Äôt do anything about it
36,I think it's cute when a guy gets flustered.
37,I mean...... You let someone he used to fuck massage him naked in private?? Girl your man is stupid but you also played yourself
38,"I kissed a guy once. In front of the whole class. When I was 12. It was meant to be innocent, but good Lord did I feel horrible."
39,"Interaction was more relaxed and natural amongst girls. With guys it felt different.

I also found my male teachers attractive and would just imagine having sex with them."
40,"You like that, you fucking retard?"
41,"It‚Äôs ironic that people like her get upset about gay guys being with them, but also push that homosexuality is this awful sin, which is largely why gay men disregard their same sex attractions and date women to begin with."
42,"Sometimes. I call it procrastibating, because I *know* I could be doing something more productive. "
43,Socks and sandals? He's very straight.
44,"When I was 18, some kid in high school messaged me on Twitter and called me ""daddy."" I blocked him. 


Bitch, I ain't no daddy. "
45,"&gt; If he's big, muscular, beardy, has a giant ass, and lots of tattoos, and walks around with a dog

how dare you tell everyone my exact type..."
46,"I guess you‚Äôre right, it just hurts like hell."
47,I take it you were on the bottom.
48,"An Italian guy, who was a tourist, asked me what was interesting here.

Nothing, I told him.

""Ah, but there is you,"" he quickly replied. I was taken aback and felt so special."
49,"Eh, the economy is shit. If you're able to save and buy a place, I say do it. There's a difference between living with your parents and being unable to cut the cord."
50,"Here‚Äôs how you bring this up in a constructive way: 

‚ÄúHey Dan I‚Äôm kinda surprised that I was the last one of our friends to know that you‚Äôre gay and meet your boyfriend. I‚Äôm sure you had your own reasons for that decision but moving forward I want to make sure I‚Äôm not doing or saying anything that would make gay people feel uncomfortable, so I want you to feel free to call me out if I say some unintentionally homophobic shit, ok?‚Äù"
51,"Yep, and probably never again"
52,"Hell yeah. Sometimes I need some me time. Totally normal, nothing to be concerned about."
53,"yep.  I've had the pleasure of doing this for a straight guy.  Corey claimed to be 100% straight, but he had a fetish for womens panties. He never got hard during the process, but the minute he was smooth.....  BAM!  "
54,"Not necessarily something I was called during sex, but someone once gossiped about me, to me while we were cuddling after sex. 

It was a small remote community, and all the gays knew each other. I hooked up with this guy and when we were cuddling and talking about local guys, he said ‚ÄúI hear there‚Äôs some guy named bucketheadrobot who is sleeping with everyone.‚Äù I said ‚ÄúUh, I‚Äôm bucketheadrobot‚Äù and we both starting laughing. 

To be fair, at the time I was sleeping with everyone. "
55,This made me think of hepatitis for some reason. 
56,[deleted]
57,‚ÄúUsed him for anal intercourse‚Äù lol
58,Yeah. Bad idea. Don‚Äôt make her event about you.
59,"I also did this when I was in preschool at about 3. We had diary‚Äôs that supervisors wrote in about what we did so the parents knew. Apparently, on the 12th of April I ‚Äúkissed all the boys in my group as they needed it‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know why the fuck they didn‚Äôt stop me"
60,Always announce 
61,"If you‚Äôre over the age of 12, an adult conversation might be sensible. You‚Äôre not in middle school anymore and you can use your words to get the job done. ‚ÄúDude, I heard you‚Äôve been using shitty ways to describe gay people. Even if I weren‚Äôt gay, I‚Äôd still think that‚Äôs a pretty fucked up thing to do.‚Äù"
62,"When I was 26, I was called ""daddy"" by a 32 year-old guy. He absolutely knew that I was younger than him.... "
63,"1. Hooked up with a guy A, with my ex
2. Met guy B, apparently guy A's husband
3. Hooked up with guys A and B
4. Met guy C, said he's waiting for friends
5. Friends turned out to be guys A and B
6. Hooked up with guys A,B and C
"
64,"I don't. I  s u f f e r  instead.

But you've got some sweet levels of empathy, so thanks for that. It's one of the rougher parts about liking guys."
65,I shower naked.
66,She‚Äôs concerned about the Lord when it comes to you being gay but engaging in premarital sex ü§ß? The mental gymnastics of homophobes who hide behind religion always amazes me
67,"Party hard but wisely,study even harder and don't expect to find the love of your life in University "
68,Gay culture is being a daddy when you are 25.
69,And this turned me on. Now Ive got a straight-guy-grooming fetish
70,[deleted]
71,"2 years of dating. 

&gt;	Just... move on. 

You can really tell the sub skews young with advice like this..."
72,I know. Please pray for me in this trying time.
73,"&gt; or do I say yes and ask for a long engagement?

Just say you're not ready yet. 6 months is a very short time. Come up with some examples of friends/family who dated for longer before marrying."
74,Went to an all inclusive beach resort with classmates right after high school graduation. My bestie/roommate wasn‚Äôt successful with his hook up and was really horny and complaining about blue balls. I jokingly offered to help him out and he actually took his dick out his underwear. I sucked him twice that night.
75,"Hey it sucks, but they‚Äôll get over it. I was a coward and told my parents together because I knew my mom was on the edge of her seat excited and my dad was emotionless and just disappointed. He came around after a little while and told me he has no issues. There‚Äôs no guarantee your parents will be 100% ok with it, but you are their son. They love you. 

Also, the ending where you said you‚Äôre off to be gay now. YES! That‚Äôs the spirit! 

Not gonna lie, my jaw dropped when I read your original post. I pictured the scenario and that was probably quite a sight for your parents haha. It happened, it‚Äôs in the past. Life is good. "
76,"That‚Äôs funny OP because my porn preference is watching 35+ y/o businessmen manage their bank accounts.

I especially like it when they open new lines of credit. üò©üò©"
77,"I'm sorry to break it to you but I don't think your ex is straight, though"
78,"I'm completely the same.  For casual sex... I'm pretty much only open to jerkoff buds.  Personally I feel like long intense mutual bate sessions with a bit of other stuff... can be just as hot... or even hotter than penetrative sex since there's no need to worry about getting STIs or the whole ""prepping"" thing.  It's safe, fun, and hot as fuck.  Plus I like that both guys are ""equal"" in it... no top... no bottom.

It's not that I'm not open to anal sex... but definitely wouldn't even consider it with random guys from hook up apps.  Personally... it's not even worth the trouble."
79,"I asked for an easy bake oven for Christmas when I was about 11. Still mad that my mom mentioned it when I came out. I just wanted more baked goods, damnit"
80,[deleted]
81,"Looking back, I have no idea how I had sex with men for as long as I did before admitting to myself that I'm indeed gay."
82,My taste in music and who I kept as company. Both mainly women 
83,"I kept trying to somehow rationalize it to myself too. Then, one day, instead of just pushing the thoughts out of my mind, I just took a second, realized I was only watching gay porn, and rarely  watching straight porn, and that was probably a strong indicator of my sexuality. From there, I went about actually accepting myself."
84,"My boyfriend chases me around with clippers if I get too shaggy, that's about the extent of our grooming :-)"
85,"I'm 27, I'm still doing this "
86, A hooker.  A fucking hooker.  Sounds like my dad when I was addicted to mmo's.  
87,Where do you live?
88,Dunno why people are so weird about condoms :/
89,"And I thought my straight suitemate was sending me mixed signals when he asked me to pet him and made little moans when I stroked his hair.

I‚Äôve always wondered how far things could go while I still assumed it was platonic because I‚Äôm terrified of being that stereotypical creepy gay guy who reads too much into things, and the answer is apparently pretty damn far."
90,/thread
91,"*insert meme of him with another random male conventionally attractive celebrity claiming to be his top/bottom*

Ugh, too bad he‚Äôs straight IRL."
92,No! This other random male conventionally attractive celebrity is way hotter! 
93,OK. Nothing wrong with that. 
94,"You could fill a graveyard with the number of potential longterm partners I can't remember anymore.  Here's the thing - he doesn't even know you live with them.  And if he has a problem with it, I can promise you he belongs in the ""definitely not"" pile rather than the ""potential"" pile. 

Just take dating out of the equation altogether. If moving is a good decision for you, emotionally, financially, etc. then move.  If it is not, then don't.  The boys will sort themselves out."
95,I'd be more attracted. A fiscally responsible guy is my sexuality.
96,"""You would know, fag"""
97,"He admits he‚Äôs an asshole but there‚Äôs no point arguing about it, I just wish he didn‚Äôt wait 2 years to tell me! Like AnAverageFreak said, I can‚Äôt force him to love me and don‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with someone who doesn‚Äôt love me. Of course I wouldn‚Äôt take him back after this."
98,"""Wrestle for top?"""
99,D'you think straight guys don't jack off to women they know?
100,Don't know how you can look people in the eye after that
101,I asked guys around me if I could see their weeners.
102,"It took two minutes for yoy to realize that?  No offense, but he may have had a point. "
103,He sounds like a real ass. Kick him out of your house and then your life. 
104,"I kinda sorta invited him and he kinda sorta invited himself? He bitched and moaned about having to move back home for a week and then kinda gave me that ‚ÄúI totally expect you to do this for me and if you don‚Äôt I‚Äôll be irrationally pissed‚Äù look, which he gives often, and I kinda just capitulated. My bad. 

But I also didn‚Äôt charge him for a week of rent, electric, or internet and told him he‚Äôs free to use my kitchen stuff, toilet paper, towels, and even some food etc. 

If I were a guest being treated that generously (in my opinion) I would be happy to leave for a couple hours so my host can have a guy he‚Äôs into over. 

I‚Äôm trying to turn this FWB into more, if you catch my drift. "
105,"I, out of experience, strongly agree with this"
106,"The focus here is ‚ÄúI want to do better in the future,‚Äù not ‚Äúyou should feel guilty for not having told me sooner.‚Äù"
107,"Hot in theory, not worth going to jail over in reality. "
108,"Low dating pool. Without help from bars/clubs and social media, I imagine it would be so much harder to find people with mutual interests, especially ones who are open about being interested in the same sex. "
109,I cried after a girl kissed me and said i want to kiss a specific boy without thinking. I was 11.
110,haha but seriously I always thought it would be some huge deal or whatever. But it just kinda happened. Like after orgasming from him fucking me I was like ok wait up... woah 
111,"I liked to play with barbies, but my mom never let me have one and I was so frustrated that girls could play with boy's toys but I couldn't play with barbies. 

Also, I had erections watching shirtless guys on TV. I thought it was normal and all boys experienced it, but it turns out it was just me. I remember asking my brother if it wasn't annoying when a shirtless guy appeared on TV because our peepee would get hard, but he said it didn't happen to him, and my mom was shocked but didn't say anything. I was like 5 or 6. 

Also I remember I didn't like to play soccer and I would prefer to play with the girls instead. But they made me play soccer anyway and I hated it. 

"
112,"I hope I am not too late. Don't let him propose. Talk to him before he does. It will be tough, but i think it is better to do so and save him from a potential public humiliation. He needs to know how you feel. "
113,"Si, papi."
114,You sick fuck
115,I LOVE watching guys kissing! The passion. There is so little of it in gay porn. It's like strip and start suckin' &amp; fuckin'. 
116,It's something that takes patience and a lot of lube. You may never get to a point where you like it. Some guys just don't like bottoming.
117,dear diary 
118,"Best you can do when someone blackmails you like that is to take away their power. Come out to them. Tell them that you had hoped to do it on your own terms but your dad is forcing your hand by holding this over your head. 

Might hurt in the end but you have already done the other necessary steps. 

Good luck. "
119,Just being honest I don‚Äôt think you guys are a good match. Your relationship values are not compatible. He‚Äôs not going to be able to pretend to want monogamy forever.
120,"Yes, back when I started using porn I'd mostly look for photos of guys. I always told myself that maybe I wanted to have a body like them. Which is true, but I also felt sexually attracted to them. "
121,*have you tried just not feeling things?*
122,"I was 15 (i honestly looked 18-20 tho), and I went to dinner with my family. My waiter was wickedly hot so I couldn‚Äôt help being extra nice and making a point to check him out. When I went to go pay (with my moms credit card) upfront, he wrote his number down on my customer copy and said I was the tastiest thing in the restaurant. I had to turn him down because when I texted him, he told me he was 25. I wish I would‚Äôve saved his number tho "
123,"Well, has it?

As a father, I couldn't imagine a better reaction. Certainly my own son will get the same, when he's old enough.

The only reason kids look at porn is because they think it's forbidden or that there's something wrong with sex. There isn't.

And that message is firmly drummed in to my own kids. I would expect that if they have any questions arising from seeing any porn, that they would feel very comfortable in coming to their own father and asking me about it, before they go anywhere else. They know I'm a sex weirdo and maniac (and for that matter, both have seen me connected  to another human at some point in their lives, albeit by accident) so who better for them to ask?

Mind you I'm not about to sit them down in front of it and insist they watch.. but I certainly wouldn't get mad if I found they had been watching."
124,"I completely get what you mean. I don't really talk sports (excl gym), I don't really talk music, I don't really talk about boobs or pussy. 

I get uncomfortable when they get into any of that. But otherwise I'm fine. "
125,I'm just gonna save this post on the off-chance that I actually draw up **Danger Twink**
126,I did this once except it was my ex bf lmao
127,"95% chance he's straight

50% chance he's in a relationship

50% chance he's somewhat into you

That's .05*.5.*5= .0125 or 1.25% you get anywhere.

Chance of hostile reaction? Varies but can be fairly high in certain areas."
128,"first off, im terribly sorry that happened. you don't have to kill yourself, you just have to figure out why to do next. what other adults do you have in your life?"
129,If I'm going to be completely 100% honest... then yeah... sometimes.  I mean... my friends are all straight and I'm comfortable with them.  But in places where I don't know the guys really well... I sometimes have this feeling deep inside that reminds me that I'm not one of them.
130,I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good idea. 
131,üëèüëèüëè
132,Don‚Äôt waste your time. Drop him from your life 
133,Suck his dick.
134,"Do your reading and homework, make sure you remember to eat healthy balanced meals, shower, and go to class"
135,[deleted]
136,"Straight passing guys tend to stay in the closet longer because they aren‚Äôt forced out by their personality. They also might take longer to fully accept themselves as gay, since they don‚Äôt seem like all the stereotypes they see. And even when they are out, they are harder to spot, because you might assume they are straight. "
137,[deleted]
138,"Papi.

I'm white. The dude I was fucking was white.  "
139,"Give him space and time. He‚Äôll come out when he wants to. I used to say the exact same thing when my mom asked. He‚Äôll figure out. He‚Äôs 13. Let him explore who he is and one day he‚Äôll tell you. 

Also most kids will want to initiate this conversation rather than have someone ask them that. He wants to have control over the timing and how - if or when - he chooses to come out.

Edit: remember when he comes out he‚Äôs not just coming out to you, he‚Äôs coming out to everyone in his peer group and school as well. His hesitation should not be construed as something aimed at you."
140,[deleted]
141,Nah it just felt like he was impaling my ass which now that I think about it sounds really hot. I dunno honestly I might do it again somepoint
142,"i told myself at least a couple of years that i was just masturbating to guys in my soccer team because i was just horny. After all i was seeing my friends and teammates naked all the time in the showers after practice. There were no girls there, otherwise i would wank to them.....for sure....dear god."
143,Procasturbating
144,"There are a bunch of gay guys who are relatively easy to ""ping"" because they're effeminate or ""flamboyant."" The stereotype exists because they are by far the most visible. But there are drastically more guys who don't fit that profile who are much more difficult to ping, and for them, dating apps have been a game changer because they take out the guesswork and awkwardness of asking someone if they like dick."
145,"Not really weird, but surprised it actually worked out the way it did, since things like this only happen in porn... but a ‚Äústraight‚Äù friend and I came home after a night out of drinking and he started rubbing his dick and said he was horny, so I just dropped to my knees and pulled off his shorts and started blowing him. Then he fucked me and it was the hottest thing ever. 

Looking back on it, I think he had some previous experience fucking a dude that I had not realized."
146,I‚Äôm comfortable enough to let my girlfriends trim me and he probably views it the same way IF he is straight as he claims
147,"Yeah but I get annoyed when they have ""straight"" guys try to rob the bank. It's like ""We know you're really gay, nobody gets into the vault that easily."""
148,Back in university I hooked up with a random guy in the university library bathroom and let him fuck me bare
149,"One time I was riding my ex, doing like a circular motion with my hips, and he just put his head back and said ""fuuuuuck"" in the sexiest voice I've ever heard. I still think about it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
150,I want to do the same except that I'm not drunk (unfortunately).
151,"Does anybody else ever look at a guy in the gym and think, ""fuck, I want to look like him ... and I want to touch his butt""? Life is complicated."
152,"Oh my goodness. This is what happened to me and my bf. We were just 2 strangers passing by at the airport. He said that I am cute and I was surprised and quickly responded ""thank you, you are handsome too""! Then we have a little talk until I have to go to boarding pass. We gave each other number. After 3 months chatting and talking from the phone I decided to visit his place and stay for a week to understand more about him and start dating. After 4 months of LDR dating I finally move in with him. "
153,This sounds like me today. Yesterday I liked this guys tweet saying that he would read poetry to whom ever till they fall asleep and he actually messaged me... after I fell asleep 
154,That's sad. Specially because you love then so much. Best of luck for you. I hope they can accept you in the future.
155," Being invisible, oh how we laughed "
156,"&gt;The only reason kids look at porn is because they think it's forbidden or that there's something wrong with sex

Don't think this is true"
157,A whisper in the ear. ‚ÄòI can give you stability‚Äô it was too much to handle. 
158,"""Guys I smoked meth for 10 years and had bareback sex with 100 men in the last 2 days, do you think there is any risk of contacting HIV or any other STDs? I am asking this because my long term girlfriend started having symptoms after we had our first baby. Btw I am straight."""
159,People don't have to be straight to be racist arseholes.
160,I know right? It‚Äôs so hot when the guys dress up in animal masks and yell ‚ÄúGet on the ground now!‚Äù at the hostages.
161,This is so cute.

163,"Ass bandit 
I still don‚Äôt get where that came from. "

165,Go to bed and sober up.
166,Fucking awesome.
167,Honestly I kinda enjoyed it but I dunno I didn't even cum I couldn't even masterbate after it was like my dick was paralyzed. He was great Id have finished if I could talk the pain any longer 
168,"From a straight coworker.  

""Hi sexy.""

Always makes me weak-kneed.   I never could have the self-confidence to just say that so easily.  

Guys -- it's true.  Self-confidence is the sexiest attribute."
169,"I'm 58 and the same, it's just a nicer way of spending a few minutes you'd be doing nothing anyway."
170,Are we suggesting that I'm straight? I can assure you that's not the case.
171,Eh maybe its just me but if I have guests I try to be more accommodating.  If I wanted to have a guy over I can have a guy over at any time just not while my friend is staying over. I mean he's kind of a jerk for not complying but if it were me I just would never entertain the thought of hosting a fwb while a friend of mine is staying there short term.  Just to kick someone out(even for a few hours) that Ive invited to stay seems kind of wrong.  It would go against my whole mentality of mi casa es su casa saying. 
172,"We also have to remember that we lost an entire generation of gay men.  They should have been our leaders over the past 20 years, and they died in their 20s and 30s in the 1980s.  Had they lived, they would be setting the example for stable, long term relationships going into retirement age.

"
173,Late stage *fap*italism
174,True friendship. They cause pain and laugh and you get a smooth butt. 
175,My husband‚Äôs sex drive is WAY higher than mine. Sometimes he‚Äôll jerk off two times a day. Doesn‚Äôt bother me at all. Completely normal.
176,"Holy crap, as someone who dreams of a lifelong partner that kills me. Hope you‚Äôre doing alright. Sounds like you were committed and patient. Hope you can feel slightly better knowing that he doesn‚Äôt deserve you. May his car be keyed, and his tires slashed.

Hang in there bro &lt;3"
177,"I wonder if part of it is familiarity, we grow up with our own cum so other guys doesn't weird us out. Women don't have that chance."
178,"Idk I feel like right now I am more into just the sex aspect. However I have started to get really turned on by his smell. Its strange, when we first started trying stuff out I did not like kissing or cuddling. However now I really like both of those things. All in all I would say he is attractive though "
179,"Italians, these guys are born with the flirt. "
180,You were thirsty for more than water
181,Right I don't know what to say but all I can say is sorry and I send hugs and good wishes üíïüíô
182,"You look waaaaay better in this photo. To be frank, bald/buzzed is *always* a better look than thinning and balding hair."
183,I need a job
184,That my sexuality is a public debate and I have to defend myself just to live
185,It's your apartment. Ask him to respect your privacy or he can leave.
186,"&gt;I've been nonstop horny since then and just want another dick 

They grow up so fast üò¢"
187,"Ugh, typical, you only go for popular aesthetic I'm going to bitch about because it's the opposite of who I am physically."
188,"Woah so youve been doing chores for eachother and are financially invested in the car together hmm. Its almost like you already are in a relationship hah.   
  
Seriously id be cutting it off before his emotions develop too much, it will hurt him but not as much as if you play him on for another month or two.   
  
But you have to be sure if you dont want a relationship because there‚Äôs no going back"
189,Would you not feel comfortable asking another man whom you found attractive about his sexuality? 
190,"And then when he angrily declares himself to be straight, you can point to this incident every time he says ""I don't see why gays have to come out. It's not like straight people ever come out."""
191,"This.  In 5th or 6th grade, everyone was allowed to bring a 45 (single) for the last day of school and the teacher let us play our songs.  Every other boy brought, I don't know, hard rock or heavy metal.  I brought Blondie's ""Heart of Glass.""  "
192,"thanks man, i think i'll talk to him and use this "
193,"If you‚Äôre into bug eyes, that is. 

I‚Äôd be too afraid of him eating my head post-coitus."
194,congratulation on ur pregnat
195,Prepare to move out. You deserve your own life. That doesn't mean ditching your parents since you could choose to live somewhere close but you should have your own space.
196,[deleted]
197,"I‚Äôm straight but I think he‚Äôs so hot I once imagined lying face down while he impaled me on his hard throbbing dick and worked me over for a full 73 minutes before flooding me with his seed. And then after I imagined it once, i imagined it again every night of the last four years. At least those nights that I, as a heterosexual male, had to spend at her place in bed with her. "
198,Who says romance is dead?
199,Don't tell her. Also shes homophobic so why would you think she'd be there for you? Ditch her and your homophobic friends and live your life.
200,Also reaching into your pocket and stroking the shaft of your penis. If he does that more than once during a conversation it‚Äôs a pretty good sign. 
201,"The proper response from him should have been ""Damn right, I'm bout to colonize that ass.""  :-) "
202,"I once dated a guy who was crashing at a friend‚Äôs place whilst he was buying a house.

He brought me back to the house, and his friend arrived in the morning and found us in her bed. 

He didn‚Äôt know that was a big no-no, and seemingly didn‚Äôt think to ask. She totally freaked out and booted him out, leaving him homeless.

I felt terrible, but could kinda see her point. I‚Äôd freak out if I discovered a stranger in my bed too.

Lesson is - don‚Äôt be a twat when someone is being hospitable to you."
203,Most guys in general lack common sense and/or are very stupid. Don't think that we're unique.
204,"There is no way to become smaller, goofball.  But you can still look up at your boyfriend's eyes and have all the same kinds of love and affection.  Your size has nothing to do with it."
205,"The relatively low amount of possible (sexual) partners.

Falling for a guy? Better not. Chances are he's straight. Or bi, but not willing to bind to a guy emotionally.

Or the worst of all. YES! HE'S GAY. Only to find out he's already seeing someone. "
206,My small continent-sized crush on Steve Iwrin. 
207,I used to always play with my moms hair. She would come home tired from work (she‚Äôs a nurse) and I would put her hair down and massage her head because it relaxed her. Then I would always end up styling it in super tacky ways with my sisters 90s hair accessories lol. I was like 5 or 6
208,"Keep it in your pants. Ask yourself how that decision would play out in 5 years? If you love your wife, maybe consider sex therapy or marriage counseling. Throwing it all away for one fantasy which you might not even enjoy sounda foolish to me. "
209,Just for clarity. All this information is coming from him and only him?
210,Good Luck!  Keep us posted on any developments!
211,I haven't laughed this much in weeks
212,"Yeah, my first gay hint was when my high school classmates would ask me what girls in my class I would date and I couldn‚Äôt even make up an answer."
213,He is ethnically and racially ambiguous so you cant be racist or xenophobic
214,"This. When I was in the closet, someone came out to me last and he said he was more nervous to tell me because he valued my opinion the most because my friendship meant the most"
215,"This Is surprisingly not that uncommon, my own inheritance was once a bargaining chip for me to turn from my gay ways. iDK parents?"
216,You know it‚Äôs not. 
217,"Everytime I have car sex lol. When I was 19 he was 17, he skipped school I skipped class and we hooked up, got to comfortable while still naked his mother and little sister came home. I was naked in his closet. He ran up to his mother and she asked him why was he not wearing a shirt and why was he so excited. Spent 45 minutes in there before I walked out his patio. "
218,"Man, dads who talk about getting their sons hookers to ""fix"" whatever ""shortcoming"" and among the trashiest people on the planet."
219,Being drunk is never an excuse for abuse. I learned the hard way. Just have a conversation and maybe suggest therapy if you want this relationship to continue 
220,"His ex is an ex for a reason, he better be prepared to be possibly pretty disappointed. Sucks you had to go two years before he actually decided missing his ex was too much to handle."
221,"Ok why do people hate on socks and sandals fuck you, i like wearing socks because theyre comfortable and i like wearing sandals because they let my feet move and breathe so ill wear them together THANKs"
222,It's almost unbelievable how you were only having straight sex and now you have hands-free orgasms on a regular basis. I'm sure a lot of people envy you.
223,Nothin gay about brownies n shit bro 
224,"Borfriend woke me up with a surprise blowjob to tell me he made me breakfast. 

He wasn't eating so when I asked him what he was having for breakfast he said that's what the blowjob was for. "
225,DISCUSTING 
226,Look past socks sandals..befriend him...tell him its a fashion nightmare üòÅüö®
227,"I respect that. I only ask because there is a difference of enjoying sex and being attracted to a man. I think in time you'll be comfortable with yourself. Keep in mind, you're allowed to enjoy all aspects of sex if thats what pleases you. You might be bi, you might be gay. Who gives a shit really, as long as you're having fun and being safe while you do so. "
228,Watersports. 
229,"I think so. It‚Äôs when we‚Äôre about to head to sleep and we‚Äôre in our own thoughts. But not a problem
You can fix at night. 

Ps: you look adorable based on your posts. Keep your standards high! You‚Äôll find someone. "
230,"I have a guy saved in my phone as ""Loud Bubble Butt"""
231,Like watching drag race and having brunch. What were you thinking :)
232,Gay people in a straight relationship
233,"No, I heard he's gay, I heard he and other male conventionally attractive celebrity I have the hots for and ship with him were caught engaging in vague act that neither explicitly nor implicitly confirms nor denies the sexuality of either of them, but is blown out of proportion by me."
234,"Not always, sometimes I'll say ""I'm close"" and they'll know. Always nice to get a bit of warning especially when you're blowing a guy."
235,"You 15 year olds getting people in trouble. My friend had this happen to him. He sat down next to this guy and started flirting with him, until he says he‚Äôs 15. Guy looked like 22. "
236,"I don't think it's your place to out someone, but it's totally normal that you're feeling shit.

My advice? Never touch a guy that's not out. It's just not worth it.

Been there, done that. Never again."
237,"This is pretty normal.  I find a lot of hardcore porn fake and unpleasant, and even with the stuff I like, the buildup is often more of a turn on."
238,I was about to say something similar but it turns out op is just a 15 years old boy. Teens at that age do all kinds of stupid shit. Good advice but it's no big deal if he wants to be petty imo
239,"Hair on men. Way back when teenage me was only into smooth hairless twinks, hair on guys used to repulse me. My love of twinks hasn‚Äôt changed but thank god I find guys with hair (specifically chest hair ü§§) on them equally as hot also! "
240,"After watching Cher Live in Concert, the HBO Special, I demanded my mom she made me a red wig like Cher's. She ended up making one for me from red yarn and a pantyhose....."
241,You are absolutely correct. I'm yet to get through an episode of Mr. Robot without needing a wank break.
242,Masturbation is kinda like food. Sometimes you finish it in like five minutes. Other times you take your time and savor every bit. 
243,"As long as it's not in front of her salad, it's okay. /s"
244,"If you‚Äôre that scared of hiv you should stop having anal sex with strangers. 

Oh wow Reddit gold. "
245,"I have safe only in my profile. 

I also just ask straight from the start if they're okay with safe. Sometimes they push back with, ""But I'm on PREP."" To which I say, ""I can't take a week off from sex if I get something and I'm not up for a shot of penicillin in my ass."" 

I don't get hookups nearly as much as I could if I'd go bare but I'm okay with it.

*For those of you wondering, I don't do oral often and if I do I will actually do it with a condom. That way I'm not too concerned about getting anything orally either. "
246,"How some people treat us weird, whether they're trying to be nice or the opposite. 

I've had nice older ladies try a little too hard to be accepting like saying out of nowhere that I look so ""flawless"" and ask what cream or foundation I wear. Is that even normal? I don't know, but every time I get taken aback because they basically just revealed that they've been observing my skin and pores. 

And more commonly, I've had older men say gays are disgusting and, ""Why would anyone date other men? Men are ugly!"" "
247,Thanks man. So I guess I should feel okay doing it myself then
248,Remember the secret tip of being a good bottom: always rub an onion on your belly button 2 hours before penetration and make sure you think of Shrek during the deed
249,"Nah, just that sort of stuff.It was fun for a bit to wonder but he‚Äôs got a gf now so I‚Äôm backin the fuck off lol.

I think he may be a little bicurious, but not enough to actually want to do anything sexual. Still, he‚Äôs super toned and walks around shirtless a lot and likes it when he catches me looking, so this ‚Äúhaha let‚Äôs ironically but not actually be a little homo‚Äù thing is working for me."
250,"You say tomato, I say cumshot."
251,You let your female friends trim your junk?
252,"I once had a full-on meltdown while laying in bed with my boyfriend. I think it went kinda like ‚Äúnobody ever compliments me, I think I‚Äôm just ugly and nobody really likes me and thinks I‚Äôm cute‚Äù (chill out, I was like 18 at the time). He basically sat up over me, looked me straight in the eyes with a &lt;not amused&gt; face and said to me dead serious: ‚ÄúTom, people don‚Äôt compliment you because they think you‚Äôre way out of their league. I still wonder how I managed to get someone as beautiful as you. Now calm the fuck down.‚Äù
I couldn‚Äôt even speak, I just hugged him as hard as I could and giggled for like 3 hours straight."
253,This!! 
254,"It sucks you lit a chunk of your karma on fire in posting the truth. I'm not sure why guys are so opposed to condoms. Do you really want to trade a few mins of fun for months, potentially years of headaches? Have fun, but by God guys need to be safe. Prep isnt the end all be all solution. "
255,"I remember telling one of my friends from highschool, after a couple years away at uni. She was crying and said she was ""so happy I'd figured it out."" 

Now, this girl is a freak. One of the most blisteringly intelligent and perceptive people I'd ever met. So I suppose that factors into why she found it so obvious. I asked her what the tell was, and it made a lot of sense. 

""Well, you're obviously not interested in women."" 

A lack of pursuit, not eye-fucking all the girls etc etc etc. Nowadays, when I'm trying to pass for straight (circumstance sometimes requires it) I've learned to alter my behaviour to better convince. "
256,Which country? You will get through this! 
257,"If you have friends whose parents you can trust, go to them.

If not, google ""youth shelters near me"" to get Google Maps locations for any nearby youth shelters and go to them.

While your parents are dealing with their own inner drama (which is not your responsibility; maybe one day they'll deal, maybe not), get the assistance you can to enable you toward establishing your own life. Your situation is unfair and rough, but dealing with it one step at a time you can not only get yourself out of it, but maybe even find some way to strengthen yourself.

Other people have gotten themselves through this and worse before. As long as you take it step by step and piece by piece I'm certain you can make your way through this. You can do this."
258,"‚Äúhey i‚Äôm gonna need holma from you‚Äù
‚Äúwhat‚Äôs holma‚Äù
‚Äúholma hand‚Äù

it‚Äôs stupid as fuck and usually the initial question gets people somewhat concerned. just my style"
259,This isn't 4chan wtf is the formatting
260,"i just scrolled through your post history, actually hoping for a pic, but instead I see a whole bunch of posts where you make yourself out to be a victim because of reason. is it because you're on the spectrum, or Asian, or whatever but the general tone seems to be you complaining about other people and oh they've affected you. Maybe you should take a step back and consider why you're letting other people affect you that way.

I wasn't there so I can't say for certain, but I can't imagine anyone ""straight up"" telling you you can't be in a club because you are unattractive, and if they did I can't imagine they said that in a vacuum without some sort of prompting from you first. if anything I think you're just using race as an excuse to not look more closely at yourself to see what the real problem is. "
261,"""I'm not gay but my boyfriend is"""
262,This same situation happened to me...eventually I sucked my straight friend off and it led to us having a threesome with my bf and having a fuck fest for the weekend 
263,Lmfao the fact that he got a handy while you were there shows how little he gives a shit about you. 
264,Sending thoughts and prayers
265,Seriously. It's obey the rules laid down by the homeowner or get the fuck out. 
266,"People generally have a lot of bad tattoos, you just don't see them"
267,"I didn't mind calling boys cute, I always called girls pretty instead of hot or sexy, and I loved The Little Mermaid; the timeless story about feeling trapped in a patriarchal home life and knowing that there's someplace out there in the world where you can be yourself."
268,"I'd tell your cousin, some of the replies here are wild as all fucking hell. Blaming his cousin for dating a slut? That his cousin won't believe him? OP if all you do is inform your cousin you did you due diligence. Infidelity isn't something that should be protected, your cousin could catch something if he thinks him and his BF are exclusive when they're really not."
269,More like a 98/100 chance of him saying no
270,"&gt;He'd literally nudge his arm, elbow against mine very softly, but noticeably too.

This means *move your fucking elbow - this arm rest is MINE*. "
271,"I like watching tv with him lying down, his head or feet in my lap while I run my fingers through his hair or rub his feet."

273,"I‚Äôve hooked up with guys that were so grossed out by cum that they had to shower if it got on them. 

My ex-girlfriend always wanted me to finish in her mouth, even if it had just been in her ass. She even asked me if she could lick off a load from my chest after I jacked off next to her. That‚Äôs something I‚Äôve never done. "
274,I feel you. *Virtual hug*
275,"Is this a USA thing only ? In France I don't say I want it safe only in my profile, I don't even discuss it because it is implied, during the act I put the condom on the top dick, lube it and hop on it. "
276,T.H.I.S.
277,"Fucked a dude in the gym shower after a run.  No words were exchanged and it wasn‚Äôt planned at all, just eyeing each other while changing and mutual head nod towards the showers.

If I do it again, I‚Äôd much rather be the bottom."
278,"My first time bottoming was pretty lousy, but it got a lot better from then on. I think the trick is you gotta really want the D because that gives you the relaxed mindset you need for it. Sometimes it gives you the really damn hunger mindset and that's made for some of my best bottoming experiences. "
279,"Lol I thought I was the only one. As a teenager I was like ""yeah I want to have sex with guys but i'm not *gay*"" Weird how we rationalize it. "
280,I say just get there first and do it. Anyone else will either wait til you‚Äôre done or just get on with it too. 
281,"I feel uncomfortable with straight men, and I feel uncomfortable with gay men.

Groups with extroverted people make me uncomfortable. If they're introverted and amicable it's easier."
282,"I'm honestly curious, where do you guys live that having sex WITH a condom is a problem? Is it really guys dont want to use condoms, or is it the guys you really wish you could fuck dont want to use condoms?"
283,"You could point him to an article that talks about how the more homophobic someone is, the more likely it is that they have same-sex attractions of their own. Trust me, they're out there."
284,"&gt; If he were honest about it I would have given him a warning

This rubs me the wrong way (forgive the bad pun).

You're not his parent.  You shouldn't be giving him warnings or time-outs or grounding him.  It is seriously unhealthy to view a relationship like you're some sort of authority disciplining your partner for his naughty behavior (unless its more of an S&amp;M scene).

He got a handy from a masseur who touched literally every other inch of him, and then his cock.  If the cock is a line in the sand for you that must not be crossed, you should break up with him - but don't treat your boyfriend like a wayward child who just needs proper parenting to become a magically monogamous trophy husband."
285,"Well, his ass can find somewhere else to stay for the next couple days if that's how he's gonna be. It's YOUR apartment, not his, and he should respect your privacy, your wishes, and your decisions. Does he even CONTRIBUTE anything? Food, rent, cleaning?

I mean, shit, I slept in my car for a month and a half last year of my own free will while I was saving up for a place to live; if he can't be bothered to be a decent roommate to you, his bitch ass can rough it for a couple nights out on the streets."

288,"We‚Äôre so sorry for your loss. 

The queer community as a whole will have you in our thoughts as you go through these trying times. "
289,"Ignore them and be a better swimmer than they are. The best revenge is being successful. 

If you ever feel physically unsafe, get a trusted adult (teacher, faculty member) involved. "
290,"This wasn't a romantic/flirtatious situation but it was a compliment from a gay friend. 

We were walking towards a bus station and were describing each other our likes in men, he said something along the lines ""I have my standards way high, I like the kind of guys from Instagram with muscle and a perfectly straight smile like yours"" 
I was looking at him really confused after that.

I laugh and smile a lot but I don't particularly like my smile so that was unexpected, I thanked him with a smile and probably a red face because he caught me off guard."
291,"Lol same. I woukd once in a while force myself to watch straight porn just to make sure ""i was still into girls"" yeah right!!"
292,"In general gay men are attracted to men the way straight men are attracted to women

"
293,"Cannot narrow it down to one thing but:  
\- Feeling like a diversity statistic (in certain places I've worked).  
\- Getting told I'm being gay wrong by other gays.  
\- When someone finds out I'm gay, getting this response: 'Oh, that's so *cool*.' Is it? OK. Pause. 'My cousin's gay, you should talk to him.' y tho"
294,"The prostate is real dude.  As for sex it's a lot more than just the physical sensation.  The idea of being dominated, desired, and controlled is very real for lots of people."
295,"Once, in like 6th or 7th grade (ages 12/13), the hot guy in class called me out for always staring at him. It was super awkward and the whole class heard.  I didn‚Äôt realize I even did it. I  said I was trying to stare out the window and he was sorta in that direction (he wasn‚Äôt) 


(I mean...he was pretty cute. He later briefly became a semi-professional surfer)

Also, when I was like, 5, I put on a production of the frog prince for my father. It starred my grandmother, my sister and me. 

My sister was the prince. 
My grandmother was the frog. 
I was the princess. I wore a pink dress. "
296,"Honestly the best way to enjoy it is to not expect anything. This may come off as harsh, but judging from my first time and the first times of multiple people I know, it‚Äôs not gonna be anything like you imagine, even if he‚Äôs super experienced or whatever. It‚Äôs gonna be awkward and it‚Äôs gonna be sweaty and you‚Äôre gonna feel lost, and it‚Äôs all okay &amp; part of the experience. But the best piece of advice I can give you is *tell him if AYTHING at all feels uncomfortable or not good.* Don‚Äôt be afraid to tell him how different things he‚Äôs doing feel and don‚Äôt be afraid to suggest things you think you might like. Also, don‚Äôt overthink it. Just let it take it‚Äôs course and it‚Äôll all be fine."
297,"What about non-LGBT youth shelters? Surely you only need to tell them that you have been kicked out of your house and need a place to get your bearings.

If there is no such thing in your area, it gets rough, but you can get through it by composing yourself and allowing yourself to think. What opportunities do you have to simply walk away to another place where you might find assistance? You clearly have access to the internet, so you have something to work with.

(you haven't mentioned what area of the world you're in)"
298,Hmmmm so many lol.  Me and my brother hooked up with my friends uncle.
299,"Confront him, and cut him out. You don‚Äôt need to associate yourself with people like that."
300,Yep.  Time to move on.
301,"&gt;I understand where she‚Äôs coming from

Look, it‚Äôs fine to give your parents some time but your mom is being completely irrational and is only *coming from* a place of homophobia. It‚Äôs understandable that any parent would be uncomfortable walking in on their kid having sex. But to cut you off financially because of it does not come from a reasonable state of mind. Your mom needs to grow up. "
302,"Got fucked by a buff masseur on the table after he got done massaging me...he‚Äôd spent a lot of time on my thighs and ass and my legs just kept spreading wider and wider and before I knew it his fingers, then his tongue, then his cock were in me and I was well on the way to a hands free orgasm. Only fuck I‚Äôve ever had where I never learned the guys name"
303,That I played with barbies?  But then again I knew I liked guys way before that...
304,"honestly, i think oral is an acceptable risk, and i would refuse oral with a condom.

HOWEVER, i absolutely 100% respect your decision to want to keep the rubber on even for oral, because your sexual health is important."
305,Too many options and guys are too picky and lazy to choose just one
