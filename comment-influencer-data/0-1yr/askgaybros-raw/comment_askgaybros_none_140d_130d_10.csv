0,"Yes, please wait till you're old enough to be appropriately disappointed by men"
1,"I wouldn‚Äôt go to either if I were you. I‚Äôd stay home and hang out with friends instead. If they get mad at you for skipping it, let them know how you feel."
2,"I think small dicked dudes would be more willing to own that shit if dudes would stop being size queens.

I mean, hell, I‚Äôve seen posts where *bottoms* are being rejected by self proclaimed tops for being too small because the so-called top was more interested in sucking dick than actually made fucking"
3,"Hey guys, despite whether you think this story is true or not if someone asks you upfront if you are negative for STIs this also includes HIV.  Yes there is a stigma around it in our community and yes, you may be treated unfairly due to it.  However, If you really want to start a relationship with someone lying about something this big isn't really a great way to start said relationship."
4,You should send one back
5,Just don‚Äôt go. Sends a pretty clear message if you attend neither of them.
6,"I don't see what the issue is, tbh.  

He's 34 and you're 24.  When y'all first met there was a power difference and he definitely kept his distance.  He approached a decade-ish later and you kindly rejected and told him you wanted to still be friends, and he's still being a friend and nothing more.  

He's at no risk of trouble."
7,Dude that's kinda gay üòâ
8,"All the best for you guys!
I'm happy to hear that you're obviously are a well educated guy with no biases around HIV."
9,"Agree and disagree. I think people seeking validation from Grindr aren‚Äôt going to get it. It takes self-reflection, discovery, and surrounding yourself with the RIGHT individuals to fill that inevitable void. Grindr will only fix or hinder that temporarily; you need to do the internal work to fix that permanently. Other people‚Äôs perception and evaluation of you isn‚Äôt going to fix the work required by yourself. 

The issue I see with what was said here is I don‚Äôt think anyone should have to be subjected to racism/fat-shaming/ridicule/prejudice/etc. just for messaging someone else on Grindr. Be a decent human being and reply ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù. I might not be attracted to you, but I can at least respect that we‚Äôre both non-straight individuals and that‚Äôs a tough enough attribute that we ALL should be supporting each other through."
10,BDSM? Bible discussion study meeting.
11,Sounds like a Bible study group to me.
12,"I‚Äôll be honest, I love slipping into conversations something about my husband. I say the word and wait for their reclamation and it‚Äôs fun to watch people try and school their features and try to be supportive of it. It‚Äôs hilarious."
13,"I already made them know how I feel and they thought I was overreacting. Thankfully, other family members came to my defence, so I'm not alone in this."
14,She‚Äôs not your friend the . Period.
15,"That‚Äôs me a lot. I‚Äôll be thinking about doing something and then in my head ‚Äúfuck that it‚Äôs not worth it, just sit in your comfortable bubble of not doing anything social‚Äù."
16,The stigma around it is outrageous.
17,"I remember my friend came out to one of our other friends in a laundry list of daily troubles he had at home. It went like ""Oh I'm so sorry I haven't been responding. There's a lot going on because of homework, and then my car broke down, I came out over facebook, my mom got mad at me about that and the dishes not being done."" ""Wait what?!"" ""I didn't do the dishes."""
18,"I think the fake ‚Äúwokeness‚Äù is a trend that‚Äôs applicable to both men and women, straight, gay, or whatever. I‚Äôve personally seen some examples of myself. In addition, I‚Äôve heard stories from women about how it‚Äôs not hard to find dating profiles from straight men who huff and puff about how feminist they are, talk big game about the books they read, etc. And of course there are the woke, sexually liberated women who don‚Äôt want anything to do with bi men. I‚Äôm sure there are other examples."
19,"Creating awkward moments for other people is my favorite pastime. My favorite is exchanges with Uber drivers. 

Uber Driver: ‚Äúwhat are you boys up to tonight? Where the ladies at?!‚Äù

Me: ‚Äúno clue. We‚Äôre going to a gay bar.‚Äù üòÖ"
20,What kind of group was it?
21,6‚Äù is literally a bit above average considering the average size is pushing 5.5‚Äù
22,UPDATE: A friend tag me on facebook about this bar gonna open soon and short of staff. They're hiring now and need people with experiences. Gonna send my resume first thing in the morning. Wish me luck you guys.
23,"""Prepare volley fire!"""
24,"Me: I‚Äôm a virgin because I want the first time to be special :~) 

Also me:"
25,"Disappointment can wait,  these kids should just enjoy their lives."
26,Hey congratulations! And don't forget to always use a lot of lube.
27,I think this also bring up the point of how important prep is in the gay community and that you should be on it if you can afford it.
28,"If this were me, I'd cancel.

Simple statement: I'm a man, and will not be attending unless I am included within the men's group. End of story.

Draw the line, and move on.

Don't validate their outdated views."
29,"Don't touch your cock at all for a good min before the top begins to enter. (Your ass muscle TIGHTENS when you grab your cock. Natures way of ""shutting everything down"" during sex) Wait until the top is in for a few thrusts and it feels good THEN you can grab your cock. (Most bottoms grab their cock to get MORE turned on. They are working against the process. Amazed how very few bottoms are aware of this) 

Happy bottoming man! Congrats on your first time!"
30,It has been only a week and both sides have been going back and forth with new plot twists and I am gay gasping left and right.
31,"The funny thing is that I'm guilty of the same thing:

At an office job I had over 10 years ago, everyone knew I was gay because I had a picture up on my cubical of my boyfriend and I.

After months of sitting next to this guy, he was telling me about some wedding he went to and then said ""of course we don't have to worry about getting married because we're both gay"". I just sat there stunned with my mouth ajar until he said ""are you okay"". To which I replied ""yeah, I just had no idea you were gay"".

I reacted exactly how many people react when I casually reveal my sexuality and so I definitely can't get annoyed at others doing it."
32,"Unless my bloodline includes casting magic, summoning demons, having the ability to commune with demons, involve being a lycan, speaking to dragons then what's the point."
33,When you said you were Dutch I can relate to your feelings.  Thats a bit off.  Dont go to either this year and make your feelings clear
34,Thank you for your words. Much love and support to you.
35,6 aint even that small tho bro. I agree we gotta stop lying about our dicks but we also need to chill on asking for the size cause tbh the surprise is fun when you get together lol
36,"Literally **no doctor EVER** will simply call you up and say ‚ÄúHey u/Yusk56z, you got the AIDS. Sorry bout dat!‚Äù  They‚Äôll have you come in and they will tell you face-to-face since it‚Äôs a life altering moment. 

Fuck you and your fake ass story."
37,She probably doesn't know what to do. Wouldn't recommend to keep friendship with her but she mostly have a good bond her own brother and cannot fathomed on what to do.  Wish you the best and hugs.
38,"But if I don't because of this advice, and he doesn't also because of this advice, then neither of us will in the first place.

Someone needs to step up.  I nominate myself, at least for a little while."
39,"Honestly I feel way safer with someone who's upfront about HIV and managing it, than someone who doesn't bring it up at all, or someone who tells me he's negative but hasn't been tested in two years. 

And maybe I'm just weird this way, but I actually find the upfront poz guys more attractive for their honesty."
40,"From what i read, he‚Äôs being respectful of your request.  If you don‚Äôt want to be friends, you shouldn‚Äôt have said that as an option."
41,"Once I did this, dating became a lot more interesting and fun.

I had dated many guys who checked a lot of boxes for me but didn't really satisfy me in the end.

Then I met this one guy who messaged me on Tinder. We met at a Starbucks for a simple coffee date. He told me about his drug abuse, his long struggle with alcoholism, his lack of a job or education... and it all struck me as odd, since I had never considered dating someone like this before. But he was very up-front about it, and he made it clear that he was in a successful recovery. I left from that date feeling doubtful, but then came the second date... and the third.... and the fourth... and so on. We became boyfriends around valentines day. I got him a card and candy, and he forgot to get me something. He dropped off a beautiful card and some candy a few hours later at my doorstep, literally in the middle of the night. My heart melted. We've been on many adventures together since, with many happy memories, and one day I'm certain I'll make him my husband.

Don't pass up the opportunity to date. You never know what you might find."
42,"Agree with you, are there other options for LGBT+ youths for socializing and dating that aren't as sex focused as GrindR though?
Always thought it would be a better option to show people an alternative other then telling them to get off grindr."
43,Well that's good other family members came to your defense but you seriously have to quit taking shit from them and demand your respect because honestly they're being so petty lol.
44,My Uber driver brought us to Pride and was like ‚ÄúIs this some sort of craft festival.‚Äù
45,"Disclose status before meeting? I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs any of their business. (Yet)

Disclose status before having sex? Always."
46,You were the one with brains.  Congratulations.
47,No glove no love
48,It‚Äôs a living.
49,"These comments are really interesting. I'm pretty neutral on this topic... I don't think it's fair that poz people be treated differently or looked down on for their status, but at the same time I think that a potential partner needs to be aware of whether they can handle the 'risk' -- whether that risk is real or just perceived. 

Although it is a bit shitty for the poz individual, I think my outlook here is that I should be able to decide whether I can/want to be in a relationship with someone who is HIV positive -- while not judging or belittling them for it."
50,I like coming out to people casually and then having to hear them talk about how accepting they are for 5 minutes.
51,"&gt;The stigma around it is outrageous. He said several people he dated before me rejected him and ghosted him because of it.

It's true. I get rejected/ghosted all the time. Even in SF!"
52,"I used to be in your position, but with age and experience I've learned to focus on what's truly important in life and love, which is why my new goal is to get my biochemistry professor to let me suck him off so I can blackmail him to get my grade changed from that F to an A+. 

I mean that class was a load of bullshit anyway and this prof is only 40 of so and still fairly cute for his age so I figure it would be a win-win for me.

He has a wife and kids but I can smell more than a little trace of homoeroticism on the man.

Lol I mean I'm joking here (actually I sort of am and sort of aren't simultaneously, life is complicated....)"
53,"My boyfriend sent flowers to my work.

There‚Äôs something very romantic about being the centre of attention.

The ladies at my office go nuts for it and I feel special. I suppose that‚Äôs not specifically for flowers though."
54,"^heathen... Sinner!!!! WHORE!!!! The scripture says

    THOU SHALT NOT LAY WITH ANOTHER MAN WITHOUT MAKING THE PLACE LOOK SPOTLESS BEFOREHAND AS IF YOU ALWAYS LIVE A CLEAN LIFESTYLE!!!

... Despicable..."
55,He‚Äôs probably single because he‚Äôs the kind of guy that gets annoyed at giving a ride home to someone he picked up.
56,"Holy fuck what an annoying, provocative and discriminatory way of dealing with it from their part. Fuck them all man. If they view you as less of a man because of your sexual orientation it‚Äôs totally on their homophobic asses. Do as you see fit and are comfortable with but I wouldn‚Äôt tolerate this"
57,"One time I was in the breakroom and these guys were talking about this female customer who ""had a bangin body with the tittys that were like ""woahh""""
And the three guys were just jacking each others egos with what they'd do to a hottie like that and when dude 1 was like ""right op, I'd bet you show her a thing or two"" I was like ""well I guess I could buuut I'd be more interested in showing her boyfriend a thing or two. I mean did you see that ass'.
There was a brief moment of silence then we all laughed and thanks to a manager walking in, the conversation was mercifully ended."
58,"As a guy with a small dick (under 5 inches), who is also vers and enjoys topping often... fuck size queens. 

I know, I know, they can't help what they're into, I'm not judging. It just sucks for me personally.

Despite that I've still managed to have sex with a lot of men, just by being honest and up front about it, being confident, etc. 

It helps that it's a nice looking small dick, and I'm a short guy so it looks proportionate."
59,"I personally have had most of my dating successes through Grindr (as opposed to the other dating apps, or even meeting people IRL). I think you have to take it for what it is (mainly a hookup app), not be offended when you don't get a response, and be pretty casual about the whole process, because even if you're having a nice convo with some hottie right now, they might randomly just stop talking to you or even block you. Who knows their reasons, but you can't take it personally. Grindr is a big game. You just have to play it and do your best."
60,By mistake or on purpose? What was the reaction?
61,This. It‚Äôs not Petty either. If they can‚Äôt get how rude that was after clearly making your request. Then I‚Äôm glad you found out now.
62,Not because theyre homophobic but because they are heteronormative
63,Sometimes a hook up isn't that great..hand will do..lol
64,"Let me start by stating I have been a florist for 15 years. The average flower buyers are males between 25 and 40. I cannot tell you how many men send flowers to other men, gay straight it does not matter. Many men who receive flowers are more prone to send out flowers as well. 

Public service announcment send more flowers before it is too late! The floral industry is struggeling for a few reasons. 1  The majority of  workers are at or past retirement age and there isnt anyone to take over.  2 flowers have been painted in a bad light by big box retailers because they do not last forever. Everyone remembers when someone sends them flowers. 3 Flowers are a luxury. Due to the economy tanking back in 2008 (at least in the US) most people now look at flowers as a luxury. They are more affordable than ever! 

Finally Buy local! Always local! Calling 1800flowers or going to proflowers means you will be spending more money on less product while pushing someone out of a job! Plus you loose the artistic vision!

Tl;dr send flowers. Everyone, yes even men, like flowers. Keep the floral industry alive and shop local."
65,Louder for the people in the back
66,I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything disrespectful about the way you‚Äôre asking the question. We‚Äôre talking with a stranger about gay sex and I think these things are just naturally uncomfortable for folks to talk about and disclose.
67,"This. I always reply ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not my type but good luck to you‚Äù if we were chatting. It‚Äôs rude to just leave somebody hanging. It nearly always ends well with some people even thanking me for my candor. I feel like Grindr is so ‚Äúefficient‚Äù that it‚Äôs easy to forget that person we‚Äôre talking to is a human being.  Even the smallest courtesies will go a long way. 

That being said Grindr will make your insecurities worse and you have to look at it for what it is: A meat market. They‚Äôre not selling validating emotional connections.  Not that you can‚Äôt find them but it‚Äôs not the primary purpose."
68,And protection
69,"Unless you are on PrEP or have tested negative after ~3 months of abstinence, there is no way to say you are HIV- with 100% confidence due to the [HIV Testing Window.](https://www.cdc.gov/actagainstaids/basics/testing.html)

Also, while regular HIV testing is pretty standard, many people don't get screened for other STIs at the same time and may be carrying bacterial infections without symptoms.

If you want to have a conversation about STIs, instead of saying ""are you STI free?"" be more specific and ask your potential partner when they were most recently tested, what they got screened for, and what their results were.

With all that said, remember that **testing is not safety**. Recent negative STI test results are not carte blanche to throw your safer sex strategies out the window, especially because you are the most likely to contract HIV from a recently-infected partner who does not yet know they're positive."
70,Congrats. So how did they react?
71,"Cease your straightness.

I SAID CEASE!"
72,"There‚Äôs always this thing I notice with straight people that I have a hard time dealing with ‚Äî I call it The One Second Porn. Whenever I come out to someone straight, especially another male there is this tiny, momentary skip of a heartbeat during which they dart their eyes at some part of my body, maybe my lips or my crotch or my chest or my ass Its during that slack, the eye glassiness, etc. I know that in their mind they are picturing one brief second of gay porn. I mean, I am a very tall person, like the size of Chris Hemsworth, and I have rather nice body parts and all, but it can feel a little exposed, and really personal when its a work mate or a boss. Its very much like in the movie Fight Club when Tyler Durden splices one frame of porn into children‚Äôs movies."
73,Me and this dude were talking about this last night. I‚Äôm 6 inches and I‚Äôve only heard good things about my dick. And he has 8 inches. He actually said that no one wants to do it with him because he‚Äôs so big. He also said that he himself seeks out guys that are average because a huge dick is too much. It low-key made me feel grateful for my size. 6-7 inches is like the best of both worlds. There needs to be more average appreciation.
74,I didn‚Äôt need to be attacked like this tonight üò¨
75,"Most popular topics on /r/askgaybros in 2019:

76,‚ÄúWhat a coincidence. We have confessions as well...‚Äù
77,"And let's not forget that we in general have a lot of very young bros here, who are naturally in their first existential crises full of self-doubts where the chosen way is to blame others.  I don't even judge them for this. I also went through it."

81,Period.
82,"Oh most definitely. I downloaded a grindr when I was too young for one.

I never used it, or even tried to get men. I was too scared.

I'm old enough now and I'M STILL SCARED"
83,"They were very supportive, my dad has more ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô views but he said it is what it is and that they both still love me no matter what"
84,"Oh totally.  I do NOT read as gay (more as a guy whose wife divorced him because he wouldn't sell his Superchunk singles), but if I have a few beers in me and the talk is already ribald, I am going to tell the story about my friend Randy who supposedly dfucked Jon Bon Jovi on a swingset, which is a major record scratch moment."

At least give the other person a chance to show you if they care. If they don‚Äôt? No sweat, move on and find someone else."
91,"If you can't go on the event because of your orientation it's blatant homophobia. Tell your allies in the family to boycott the event.

What your cousins are doing to you is seven kinds of shades of fucked up, and they are telling you to your face that they don't see you as a man. You're being excluded from the men's group due to their fears.

They booked a thing? They can unbook it and book a different thing that includes you. And they can take any financial hits as an ignorance tax."
92,"Don't drink anymore because it makes you cry over silly shit. Do a bit of research and get all the facts. Was your friend talking drunken shit? Does your mom know your friend is bisexual? Does your mother really not support you?

93,"Same. First BF was OkCupid. 3 years. Second was met outside of apps. 3rd BF was 2.5 years, Grindr. My current man and I are about to tick the 2 year mark, and we met through Grindr. A lot of my dates, flings, and good FWBs also came from Grindr. I‚Äôve had plenty of success in regards to meeting people, but for every person I‚Äôve spent quality time with, or even every person I just had a one night stand with from that app, there were probably 10-15 conversations that were crap and went nowhere.

Key is to be casual and have no expectations - I view all the apps as just a passive way of letting the world know you exist. It‚Äôs like throwing bait on a lure and letting the fishing rod sit there. Sometimes you‚Äôve gotta toss the fish catch back because it‚Äôs too small, sometimes you hook garbage on the bottom of the river, sometimes you catch nothing -  you‚Äôve just gotta be patient and enjoy the rest of the world around you while you fish.

(And for the record - my mentioned relationships didn‚Äôt work out because of deeper issues that came up through the course of the relationships (money, career changes, family pressures), and not some grass-is-always-greener-dating-apps-ruin-gay-love thing. Didn‚Äôt mean any of them weren‚Äôt quality, fulling, or a source of personal growth)"

97,"42 here.   

Things I'd do differently:   

\- Don't dwell on some 8 month-relationship that ended and then ""swear that you'll never love again"". Fuck that. Cry over it by all means, but don't let it stop you from finding love again. There is still time!     

\- Don't be so hard on yourself. I hated the fact that I was not a ""hot guy"" but looking at pictures of younger me I can't help but say ""well, I wasn't really that bad looking after all"". I saw David Sedaris recently and he addressed young people saying something like ""you don't realize just how good-looking you are in your twenties"". So true    

\- Workout more. There is always something you can do to improve your body and stay healthy. Stop making excuses. Find something you enjoy doing, keep active, keep moving, eat healthy. More importantly, do it for you. Your 40-something future self will be very happy to not have to deal with back issues, diabetes, and a miriad of other problems that come from unhealthy behaviors     

\- Be more daring. See that cute guy you got the hots for? Talk to him. Best case scenario you got yourself a date. Worst case scenario you get rejected,which sucks but at least you'll know for sure    

\- Save money. I know, it's hard. I remember times when I had to eat a tuna can for lunch because I could not afford more, but do your best to save. If you're in the US and your company has a 401K then put money in it, as much as you can afford. Find ways to save money. Cook your meals for the week on Sunday, learn to use coupons at the grocery. Limit the number of times you eat out (work cafeteria counts as eating out)    

\- Be wise when you do spend money. I always wanted a new car and I foolishly went and bought one. It was thrilling for the first couple of months, after that I could not have told the difference between a new car and a used one other than my bank account would have been much happier      

\- Learn something new. Want to learn to play a musical instrument? Do it! Want to learn how to draw/paint? Do it! Don't wait any longer, if there's a way you can afford it, just do it. Don't spend all of your free time on a couch doing nothing. I love video games but if I had just cut by half all the time I spent playing video games and dedicated that to learning something I would have found more satisfaction back then (and now)   

\- If you're in a bad relationship get out of it now. This goes for all ages of course but I see so many guys in their twenties just sticking to their bad relationship because ""what if I don't find someone again""    

\- Enjoy sex responsibly. Experiment, get naked, do a threesome, do a foursome, hook up! Have sex, find what kinks really you enjoy. But be aware of safety. Get on prep, get your HPV vaccine, get consent, learn that no means no, and all that. But enjoy your sexuality!"
98,This would be so helpful (I'm 17 yo and I'd like to meet people)
99,Nah but i‚Äôll swallow cause mama ain‚Äôt raise no bitch
100,Reaction was shocked and horrified (horror was the girls in the gc).
101,"Men, prepare thy mouths! Spread thy cheeks! Arch thy lower backs! Turn thy cheeks! We must be ready for wherever the enemy intends to land!"
102,"This was me this past weekend. A guy I know was hosting an orgy and invited me. I was half way to the hotel room when he told me that they weren't doing condoms, but they were all clean. I know he is clean and I trust him, but I'm not sticking a random dudes dick in my ass without knowing him a little better. My friends all made fun of me for flaking, but I was so nervous that one of them may have been lying. Idk. Maybe I was being too scared."
103,born into money. has no actual anything of his own.
104,"I know someone who was entrapped this way.  He was 23, A profile  message him and over and over for 2 months as friends.  Later the profile reveled his age was 17.  The profile was deleted and remade.  Finally one day at a low point he said he would meet.  De drove to a public place to pick him up. 

It was a cop sting operation the whole time.   Targeting young gay men.  He was charged with solicitation of a minor.  As if he had been hunting for kids online..."
105,"/r/LGBTeens for socializing I assume, I think Tinder had a separate setup for under 18, but they may have removed it, not really sure on details because I never used it."
106,"IV positive guys who take their meds every day without fail are considered undetectable, or in other words, the viral load in their blood is so low that they can't even be measured. That also means, today, that this person can't transmit HIV.

Guys who are sexually active and don't want to wear condoms while they have sex can prevent becoming infected with HIV by taking PrEP, which is part of the traditional medication taking by those who are already positive. By taking PrEP, even if they have sex with someone who's positive and doesn't know it (high viral load), they won't get the disease (provided they've been taking PrEP for long enough and correctly).

If one has sex without protection with someone else and feels they could be in danger of getting HIV, they can take PEP, which is very similar to PrEP but more helpful in cases where the sexual encounter already happened. Its effectiveness is only proven for people who take it up to 72 hours after doing the deed.

And finally, HIV isn't great, but a person who takes their meds correctly lives virtually the same life as someone who doesn't have the disease, much like someone with high blood pressure. They have a lower count of CD4 cells, which are helpful for immunity, but the difference isn't that dramatic in healthy individuals, so you don't have to be afraid for your friend's life if they tell you they're HIV positive, and you don't have to feel like your life is ending if you end up getting it.

Sources: did my own research since my first boyfriend was HIV positive and so is my current one."
107,"Why can't a couple of my straight friends make ""mistakes"" like this?"
108,She told me she wasn't awake when it happened but knew about it.
109,"Given all the advice that you've received, I hope you also make space for social bonds with people that are older than you. One of the current fascinating things about gay men, is that we had a generational loss (HIV/AIDS). We don't have the mentorship that we should have received regarding aging, maturity, and what it means to become an older individual. There are gaps in oral history, in cultural heritage, and simply said, in role models. Who do we turn to as examples of what healthy (aging) relationships look like? I'm not saying they don't exist, but they certainly aren't as visible as I wish they were. Just because you're not into them by age, doesn't mean you can't benefit from carrying a relationship with them.

I'm incredibly jealous of your situation, because I've often sought after the attention (non-sexual) of older men, because I want advice, guidance, and just something outside the echo chamber of my own generation. I hope you can get over whatever discomfort you have with this person, and that you can reciprocate with the potential for a friendship. I'm baffled by how many posts here start with ""Am I the only one that..."" and then end with a lot of people feeling lonely/lonesome. Social bonds aren't created on just platonic convenience. They're also about learning through the discomforts of age.   


I hope in a few years (maybe a decade) you look back at this moment and you can evaluate with older eyes."
110,"The reason I deleted dating apps is because I found myself falling for guys I met IRL that I wouldn‚Äôt swipe right on on tinder or bumble or whatever. Whether it was their personalities or just seeing somebody in person instead of a few pics, I came to realize my standards when browsing through hundreds of guys online were unrealistically high."
111,"Yes, the scummy part of me loves to see the light die in a girl whose acting dumb cause she thinks I think she's hot."
112,I had a kid contact me once. Hebsaid he was 13 and intold him i understand your need to connect with people but this is not the place. I didn‚Äôt continue. I reported him and blocked him. It‚Äôs stupid dangerous for me as well to engage any further. If that kid had send me a dick lic or something üò≥ü•∂
113,You‚Äôre loved bro trust. And you‚Äôll find love too. ü§¥üèΩ
114,"I know. But I was so drunk that I told her about something worse that had happened with me and I just feel so dirty all over again. And I'm inappropriately reaching out to people and its pushing them away and it just feels like everything is getting further away when I need it most.

&amp;#x200B;

I also started talking about this to my friends in the first place because I thought it would help but it hasn't, which surprises me."
115,What's a boyfriend?
116,"""You seeing anyone?""
""Yeah, I'm actually engaged. ""
""Oh nice! What's her name?""
""Mark."""
117,"Do people ‚Äòmoan‚Äô when they‚Äôre jerking off? I mean I sometime let out a view breathy ‚Äòuh, uh‚Äô noises during the first three big spurts, but I don‚Äôt moan during the whole event.

Or is the moaning a type of acting to make it sexier for the intended recipient?

I guess a silent jack off video other than the chchchchchc noise isn‚Äôt so sexy or interesting."
118,"This is awesome! Just out of curiosity, how did you set it up? Through meetup.com, or something similar perhaps?"
119,"You aren't hearing this correctly.  All the shit many of us deal with hiding being gay / having subtle or not so subtle discrimination against us can make us very sensitive to over state over imagine how our parents interpret our queerness.  I speak from personal experience here.  My father is a conservative, Baptist style Christian.  Now there are some real issues between us and I don't feel fully accepted, but he does love me, treats me cordially at family events, and make efforts to reach out in his way.  Talking to my sister over several glasses of wine she said he had never even privately expressed to her the kind of anti-gay views I assumed he had in private (though he had not expressed supportive statements either, still better than I had thought).  

&amp;#x200B;

In your case, I would read what your friend said as: ""Maybe your mother isn't as hung up on sexuality as you think she is.""  Was she thrilled about your being gay?  Likely not.  If she has close openly bisexual friends she treats well, she sounds reasonably progressive on sexual / social issues and could come around or has largely come around.  In short, I think this is likely 70% about you and only 30% about her, so try to work through these feelings (either by yourself, or perhaps in a couple targeted sessions with a therapist).   Also, I think it would be worth soberly opening up to your mother just the two of you in a non confrontational way and talking about how you feel she doesn't fully accept your bisexuality.  Given what you've told me about her, I don't think she'd freak out and might welcome this conversation."
120,Don't forget falling in love with straight guys
121,"This. 

A man can't pass on HIV if he's on his period."
122,This story is so fucking fake.
123,"Some jobs I was. If the subject comes up and someone asks me directly I'll tell them, but I don't go around and tell people though."
124,Why would he hide the therapist in the bathroom? lmao. Sounds fishy
125,Yea probably. I asked what he does and he said something about a family company
126,just tell her that you're gay and there's no chance you'll try to come on to her
127,"you might grow up used to be silent jerker to avoid being found, but try moaning jerk off when home alone. just relax and let it go. it feels good"
128,"Well you should be downvoted, particularly considering you're a white supremacist. Here's just some of the racist shit u/protoclown98 has said

130,"There‚Äôs a regular customer at the grocery store I work at who loves me. My manager and the service desk managers think I‚Äôm his favorite employee. He‚Äôs incredibly homophobic though so when I leave for greener pastures I‚Äôm going to casually come out.

I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing his reaction."
131,"My dick is barely 5"" and I wish it was thicker and bigger when flaccid but overall, I'm very happy with it. 

It's all about finding the correct position for anal (I can't fuck a guy riding me because I don't get in deep enough)"
132,Thought the same. A 10 day old reddit profile with a bullshit story. Lets continue to spread the stigma by making up sad stories that aren't even remotely feasible.
133,"Completely rude. 

Completely out of line. 

I would boycott both groups. I would send a message and state if they don‚Äôt want a gay person as part of the family they should just say it. That family is important to you. That you wouldn‚Äôt treat any of them so disrespectfully. 

Then wait. See if you get some real apologies? If not. Forget them. They were fake and didn‚Äôt have your best interests at heart."
134,"You need to go home, to your mum and sister, you'll be able to find a job there. From your story I can tell you are so strong and resourceful. You don't need to tell your mum why your going back, yet or ever, if you don't want to, but you do need to get out, home is the safest place for you."
135,"Yes.

I personally have a few gay, single friends that I've never even seen naked.

Just takes self control and finding a good guy to be friends with."
136,Small dicks are hot af. Short guys are hot as all f. What are you doing later?
137,This is the only logical explanation.
138,That's not really a big age difference though
139,"Preach it. 
So true in my experience."
140,"I agree you shouldnt be rude. But I don't owe anyone an explanation of why I am rejecting them. Hense why I just don't respond/ignore the majority of guys who message me. As when I do say sorry I'm not interested, they always ask why. And it goes on a lengthy process. Far easier for me to just ignore.

The only time you should do it is if your dealing with blank profiles. Then I will say your not my type."
141,"No offense intended. HIV is obviously, not a cold. However the methods of dealing with HIV today vs 20 or more years ago, is rncoyraging in that not necessarily death sentence.

My approach: you gonna dip it or be dipped in, then get tested and use condoms even w PRep if unsure"
142,I didn't recognize him without the handcuffs.

145,"Bi dude in my 20s. I'd drop the ""I don't like to assume"" because then it makes it seem more like a standard medical question than your opinion about how my behavior/clothes/speech corresponds to my sexual preference."
146,"Maybe ""I ask this to all my patients"" so they don't think you're singling them out? I don't think there's anything wrong with how you're wording it. There's always someone who's offended at these subjects no matter how you phrase things."
147,"It's okay to try, as long as you know when to give up and move on."
148,"She is either lying about not being awake, or her older brother told her about it. In either case, it's obvious she didn't give fuck. So ditch her as a friend."
149,"Joke‚Äôs on them, since I‚Äôm bi."
150,"Threesome. There was a couple on Grindr, both of them hot af. They asked me if I was interested. I was but declined cause I'm a wussy :("
151,Why do people just throw around prep like it's no big deal. It's a serious medication with sereral side effects and long term affects on your liver
152,Meeting up with a stranger from the internet with a phone dying/about to die is the dumbest thing. Jesus.
153,"Awesome post and wonderfully articulated. As a fellow Poz guy I wish everyone would head this advice. 

Can‚Äôt tell u how many times I‚Äôve been ghosted after disclosing. We need to be understanding and caring towards everyone."
154,You did the right thing. How she reacts is a reflection of where she's at emotionally. Stay strong.
155,"I did when I was underaged. My advice is don't, I know none of this advice does anything but don't."
156,The first man to disappoint me was my father. Beat that.
157,"Massage therapists don't get naked at work or have a code of professional secrecy so strict they need to hide, your husband was obviously getting frisky with him.

If you have nothing in common, aren't intimate, and he is this comfortable spouting off incredibly obvious lies to your face then your marriage ended quite some time ago in all senses but the strictly formal.  What you have is not a husband, but a below average housemate.

Either the sleeping with other people (assuming monogamy), the loss of intimacy/common interests, or the lying would have been cause for marriage counselling on their own.  With them all combined there's not really any point in even trying it IMO, it's well and truly over.

The emotional blackmail and suicide threats only serve to add urgency to my recommendation of 'GTFO for your own good'.

Sorry you have to go through this shit.  It'll be hard for quite a while, but there's always an end to bad times as long as you keep moving forwards."
158,Lot of ignorance and lack of education
159,"I get that you‚Äôre infatuated right now, but jumping to love and marriage after one night is way too fast! Sex and intimacy releases chemicals in your brain that may leave you feeling some type of way but don‚Äôt get too far ahead of yourself and definitely do not tell him this. You should ask him out on a date if you like him but do not, I repeat do not tell him that you love him."
160,"As someone who‚Äôs struggled with mental health for some time now, this is imperative. Taking the time is essential, and you‚Äôll be able to think much more rationally."
161,I don't think normalizing and encouraging something are the same thing. If you take away the stigma then people would be most apt to get tested because they know that it's not a life ending disease. Making it seems awful and scary just makes it so someone won't want to get tested or feel ok opening up about their status.
162,"Precum is primarily composed of mucus which is water and glucose. That‚Äôs why precum has a slightly sweet or mild taste. It contains enzymes that change pH inside the urethra to allow for the safe passage of sperm in ejaculate (cum).  Ejaculate has several other components and the change in consistency, odor and taste can occur frequently."
163,"Here‚Äôs the problem with that: I don‚Äôt have the time. I‚Äôm a reasonably attractive guy, but nothing special. When I‚Äôm on Grindr I get 20-30 messages per day and maybe 3 of them will be from people I‚Äôm interested in. If I take a minute to reply to each of those guys I‚Äôm not interested in, that‚Äôs half an hour of polite rejections. I could handle that if it were effective. 
 
Grindr gays don‚Äôt take rejection well. A polite ‚Äúno thanks, you‚Äôre not what I‚Äôm looking for‚Äù isn‚Äôt the end of the conversation. It‚Äôs seen as an opening for them to litigate why they ARE in fact what I‚Äôm looking for, and I just don‚Äôt realize it. This is usually communicated with a bunch of pics that I‚Äôd really rather not see.
 
 I do try my best to respond and communicate my lack of interest, but it‚Äôs a Sisyphean task. And again, I‚Äôm reasonably attractive but nothing special. Imagine how much harder it is for the tens out there. 
 
A guy on Grindr owes you nothing more than a stranger on the street: nothing."
164,"I mean.....its obviously pretty harmless, but its also a matter of your comfort as well. Youre not required to do anything youre not comfortable with.

&amp;#x200B;

that being said as someone who is also into musky scents sometimes theres nothing better than a little bit of funk. Like he said, nothing over the top stinky, but a powerful scent can be really powerfully sexy for folks who like that kind of thing."
165,"Here and Facebook, surprisingly. LAGayBros is a cool sub, plus I posted some pics on Gaybros and folks have been messaging me."
166,Sometimes I feel like I'm one of the only guys who actually prefers average to smaller dicks than big ones. Sure big dicks are nice to look at but when it comes to sex it's just too much for me.
167,I hope so....
168,"Well it kinda is, isn't it?"
169,"Hah. More than often if goes like

""Sorry not my type""


And they reply

""Fuck you"""
170,Like by mistake?
171,Sounds like one of the male relatives has a problem and your cousins are covering for him and trying not to hurt your feelings but they're being pretty transparent.
172,"My family‚Äôs never had separate events depending on the gender so I can‚Äôt relate to that, though I have often been invited along for ‚Äúwomen only‚Äù stuff amongst my friends. Even before I came out, oddly enough. 12 years old and I was invited to a female friend‚Äôs house for a sleepover. Only boy there."
173,"I had an irate customer shout at me that I was a f\*g right in front of my boss. I just stared at them and said, ""You say that like I didn't already know that. Are you trying to ask me on a date?"" The guy turned pale white and my boss just laughed his ass off."

176,Watch the sketch by Key and Peele Office Homophobe
177,"&gt; A few days later, the doctor called telling me that I tested positive for HIV

yep, that line from his story screamed bullshit, and this post should be removed. what a piece of lying shit. as if poz people aren't facing enough stigma as it is. fuck this OP."
178,"Not too say that selling validation from Grindr is healthy or productive for anyone, I can't agree with your post here. 

Grindr is designed to make it easy to dehumanize people. It promotes this with many of it's design choices. I don't think it does so intentionally, but Grindr tends to depress and frustrate people far more than Tinder does. Even Scruff is a lot better than Grindr in this respect. 

By making it extremely easy to harass people, reducing them to their physical appearance and what they're ""into"", and displaying them as almost products on shelf, they make it easier to see these people as tools for getting off rather than people you can form an actual connection with. 

To be clear, I have a fair amount of success on Grindr. I'm not swimming in a sea of men or anything, but I don't feel like I need Grindr boys to like me in order to feel validated. I think that anyone who does probably doesn't have business on these apps. They're probably not in a good enough place to be hooking up, or there may be a better app out there that will make them feel less isolated. But even so, I sometimes find that Grindr depresses the shit out of me.

I hate getting messages from faceless profile. I hate seeing people who are blatantly racist in their profiles. I hate seeing the body shaming, masc4masc bullshit, and the people who will not stop messaging you when you've never given them any indication of interest. 

Before I get the downvotes for that paragraph I would like to elaborate a little. While I don't believe that you can be disinterested in entire races of people, even if that is something you believe, this belief has no business in your bio. Its fine if you're not attracted to someone, but you don't need to preempt an exchange with them by putting that in your bio. That would be like walking up to everyone you're not into at a gay bar and telling them you aren't attracted to them. It just causes upset for people. On top of that, you just kinda look like an asshole. Not sexy. 

I know it's easy to say ""hey Grindr it sucks that people suck on your app fix it"" without suggesting any real solutions, but I think it would be worse to reduce the complexity of this problem. I have a few ideas that might help the app but I am not familiar enough with what they have already tried, nor do I know what kind of data they have access to that reveals exactly where the problem areas might lie. So I'm choosing not to speculate here. 

This turned into a bit of a ramble, but it's a complicated issue and I wanted to cover my bases a little. I'd love it if this comment promoted some kind of discussion or at least made people think. If not, I'm prepared for downvotes to oblivion ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è."
179,"Hypocrisy is nothing new.

Hot people know that putting some bullshit caption about loving yourself underneath a picture of their abs will get them more likes and comments. 

The solution here is to stop following vapid instagays."
180,"Yeah they removed it, which was a shame because I actually met some friends through it, I can understand why it was dodgy though"
181,Because gay men made them fashionable a few years ago.
182,Report all underage guys and set your parameters to minimum 21 years old.  Much younger &amp; they have no idea what they are doing in bed anyway !

193,"Back in the late 80s I worked as an intern in a clinical lab of a big public hospital as part of my school's technical ed; I was just a teen that helped with a few things here and there. One day I heard people in the lab murmuring that one of the blood samples that day was from a person ""with the AIDS"". No one, not a single person wanted to touch the vial with blood. The manager got involved, words were spoken, people were scared. At the end of the day the vial stood alone in the otherwise empty lab. That person did not get their tests done. Those were scary times for sure, the misinformation was truly bad, specially in smaller towns.    

In the 90s when I started having sex things were still scary. So many people had died from AIDS-related complications and medication was either expensive or difficult to get; I was always on the edge and paranoid about it. One day I found out that my best friend was positive. He did not tell anyone until he felt he could trust them, he was ashamed of being shunned or having the stigma of being HIV+ on him. Of course if he met someone he liked for dating/sex he would tell him but more often than not that resulted in him being rejected. He was a beautiful handsome guy, full of life and kind to everyone, he always found a way to make me smil. He was taking his medication and getting checked, but the disease progressed. He died at 28.    

After my friend he died our group of friends volunteered in a hospice in the outskirts of town, a small home that barely had enough money to keep running. When we asked what could we do to help -- should we clean the place, should we cook something -- we were told that what the people there wanted the most was to talk to another human being. I remember a man, he must have been in his 40s, his family had shunned him when they found out he was HIV+, he had no money, he could not afford medication, and he started developing cancer. He found the hospice, and he went there to die. He had sores all over his body, he was incredibly thin and his hair was falling out in pieces. Next to his bed was a picture of a young handsome guy. He said ""oh! Look at me! I was so beautiful back then!"" I told him he was. We talked for a long time, he had had a fascinating life that was cut short by this virus and now was just there waiting for death.    

Please be careful out there. Get tested, get Prep, use condoms, measure your risks, treat people with respect regardless of their status. We are all human."

I‚Äôve seen gays drone on about body positivity on Twitter, celebrate ‚Äòthicc‚Äô guys (who are basically just muscular), but will also attack people that are underweight and make snide remarks about ‚Äúskinny white twinks‚Äù and Timothee Chalamet. Ultimately they‚Äôre being shallow and body shaming but can get away with it.

Simple as that. The stigma is there, yes. But the disease, albeit livable nowadays, is potentially life threatening. You don't know if that guy has a genetic immune disease already, or a tendency to contract certain diseases. 

I've already been told by my doctor that it could kill me, even with proper meds taken every day. I get chronic tonsillitis and asthma constantly, which further puts me at risk for pneumonia. If this story happened to me? My timer could be a lot shorter than most people's."

232,"When i was 20 I dated a guy with HIV and even though he was undetectable and healthy, it gave me severe anxiety and sometimes I just couldn‚Äôt perform in bed. The relationship didn‚Äôt work out in the end, but because I‚Äôve ‚Äúbeen there‚Äù I can understand why certain people aren‚Äôt willing to date someone who is positive. It takes a great deal of awareness and mental maturity to date someone with HIV and I didn‚Äôt have that when I was 20. I was too young and worried about getting a virus that society sees as a ‚Äúgay death sentence.‚Äù üôÑ

Now 9 years later, meeting someone who is positive is absolutely no issue at all. I‚Äôm not afraid of HIV and I even have a friend I hook up with every once in a while who is positive and undetectable. I‚Äôve gotten tested throughout the years and I‚Äôm still negative so, I don‚Äôt see the need to freak out. 

A friend of mine who is finishing his last year of medical school told me that there is an alarming amount of men with the virus who aren‚Äôt even aware they have it. Statistically speaking, many of us have had sex with positive men but didn‚Äôt even know it."
233,Me before thinking of hooking up. Sometimes being horny gives you a shit ton of emotions that goes away after cumming.
234,I‚Äôm sorry to hear that dude.
235,"Well, I've been 19 for about eight months now, and generally get along with and prefer guys around my age range. So I am one of the younger guys myself."
236,There was probably more to this story than you were told. Telling someone they are into friends and having a 23 yr old pick up a 17 yr old is not a sexual solicitation crime in any state. Sending nude pics or what later turns out to be more sexually explicit chat than what your friend revealed is more likely what happened. You have to give clear and convincing evidence of solicitation. Someone who just wants to talk or hang out isn‚Äôt going to cut it with the DA.
237,"As an older man who has been through the births of both political correctness and wokeness, just calling yourself that is exposing yourself as hypocritical and arrogant -- it's akin to a spiritual person calling himself ""enlightened."" If you really are woke, there's no need to declare it or even think it."
238,"Your friends don‚Äôt sound very supportive. As much as there‚Äôs all this talk about HIV being a manageable disease these days: why would you risk getting ANY disease that you could prevent simply by avoiding risky behavior! My parents both had adult onset diabetes: my father was very proactive with his diet and was able to avoid progression but my mother was addicted to sweets and died of renal failure.  

Bravo for not caving to peer pressure and putting yourself first!"
239,"You won't be poor as fuck your entire life if you take charge of it.

You'll just have worked for what your friend was handed.

That's why I'm not friends with people like that.  I can't stand listening to someone bitch about their problems when someone else has already solved all the really hard survival level basic existence problems for them."
240,"I don't like to assume can imply that you're already assuming something, that you think they are gay by even bringing it up, more due in part to anxieties on their part. Or just makes you seem like you're out of touch (because EVERYONE needs to be on the same page of habits and mannerisms!)

I would just ask the same question, without tacking on the end. If anyone has an issue with you asking it's probably because it's the first time they get asked and might not be aware of the different risks you need to assess. Otherwise they'll know it's standard and shouldn't  be surprised by you bringing it up."
241,"I remember going on a date with this guy who was such an asshole. He kept bashing the town I live in as some kind of horrid place that no one would choose to live in. He said other things that were a total turn off. We had nothing in common. We started talking about HIV and how things may be different for young guys coming of age now compared to twenty years ago. 

He confided that he'd recently become positive and how annoyed he was with himself that after sustaining a negative status for so long he'd become infected. This part of our conversation was the most real and down to earth of the date. When I didn't make any moves to see him again he got cocky with me, very snarky about what he perceived to be my snubbing him over his HIV status. When I told him I found his views offensive and had no need to be around that kind of negativity he was greatly relieved. 

I was ditching him to the curb because he behaved like an asshole. The guy knew he was kind of a dick and acquired taste, and felt better about the whole thing after I opened up. I don't normally go out of my way to tell someone things that might hurt their feelings, but in this case he seemed happy to hear why I didn't like him. Of course, no one is obligated to explain why they don't click with someone."
242,"There were two questions there, buddy"
243,"Sounds like everyone on this thread is 25. I‚Äôm in my late thirties, and married or not, I don‚Äôt have time for anal sex every day."
244,Can you catch diabetes from your partner? No. You can't compare the two. Ridiculous.
245,Being gang fucked. Don't know why. Can't explain it but I've always wanted to be fucked by multiple guys.
246,Shoot your fucking shot dude.
247,"A friend of mine married a man like this. 20 years and 3 kids. 

He never wants to be affectionate. She is starved for it. 

She won't leave because of the kids and she wouldn't seek it elsewhere. 

But she's MISERABLE. 

Don't let this be you."
248,They knew you were gay
249,Yeah long as they are clean then i love doing it and don't understand some of the prudes against it.
250,"There's a non-pedo 'affectionate' use of the word ""kid""?

Anyone younger than me is ""kid"" tbh, and I'm only 23. Hell, my 25 yo sister is kid. (She's also a foot shorter and looks younger - throws people for a loop)"
251,When I started having sex with boys. It just felt so natural. It‚Äôs funny because in other departments I‚Äôm not as confident lol.
252,"I think everyone in this sub can somewhat relate to this. In my opinion, you are the type of a person who gets anxiety attacks when it comes to hookups and you need someone regular.

Why won't you just try to talk to people to hang out for a drink or two? Or to a gym, walk, anything YOU want to do, so even if that guy would not be a match, you'd still enjoy the time.

Oh wait, I'm actually developing this idea into a relationship or fwb. Wouldn't be that bad, would it?"
253,"Same. statistics wise it's less risky than what most guys do which is just ask if a guy is ""clean"" then just take their word for it. I'd sooner turn down someone for being a smoker before turning down someone for being poz."
254,"My mom and my friend always talk about her relationships with guys and girls. They bonded really strongly because the both of them had trouble and lost their babies several times when pregnant.

I know for a fact that my mom doesn't support it because she has told me straight to my face and even told my younger brother to jump off a bridge when he came out. It was a chaotic 3 weeks that nobody now talks about."
255,"Eh as someone who is pretty much an outlier of the typical gay attraction (Black, Feminine, Androgynous looking), I'm well aware of how my sense of self plays into the attraction field, usually unfavorably and I can admit it sucks and I don't think it's wrong to lament just a little bit on it (regardless of who you are) as long as you don't get sucked into it. 

The problem arises the moment you start blaming others for the lack of attraction. People here may have seen my posts around here with the type of guy I'm into and how i just never have luck attracting them for whatever reason. However I have not nor will I ever cast blame on the type of guys i find attractive who are not attracted back. It's selfish, rude, and unfair because if I'm allowed to have a type of guy, they deserve to to as well even if it ends meaning I'm not their type back. That's where some people on the fringe make a mistake, casting blame on others. 

On the reply thing, i used to be one of the people who thought not replying was rude and to a degree, I think it still is but upon reflection, I can understand why some don't bother to respond back because it's true that some guys don't take a simple ""Not interested, sorry"" for an answer and it just gets annoying. I rarely if ever get messages on Grindr but on the rare times I do, it's usually a guy I'm not attracted to and I've politely turned down some in the past and they just give me nasty remarks or keep heckling me until I block them. So with that in mind, I certainly understand why some would rather give the silent treatment when it comes to apps. 

And this is why I can't stress why I would rather have guys say things like ""No Fems"" or ""No Blacks"" in my case because it definitely lets me know where I stand with the guy and whether or not to message or not. People can go on and on about how ""No Blacks"" is racist and ""No Fems"" is homophobic but honestly, do you really want to be with someone who secretly resents you? Not worth it and I'd rather know then and there are whether I should bother messaging or not, I hate playing the guessing game lol."
256,"Prep isn‚Äôt a solution for everyone, unfortunately. I personally tried it for two months but had severe stomach pains. I started searching around about side effects and there‚Äôs quite a lot of discussion out there. It‚Äôs a pretty intense drug!"
257,"Which is nothing the older you get.

I have an easy formula for this: take the older person's age, divide by 2 and add 7 to indicate the lowest age a partner can be before it gets into creepy/inappropriate territory.

For example, the teacher is 34 so half his age is 17 plus 7 gives you a low age of 24, right on the cusp.

If someone was 20, their low age of dating appropriateness would be 17, again toeing the line on OK.

When you're talking about a 50 year old, the low age is 32. Ages don't matter nearly as much when everyone is a mature adult."
258,"He‚Äôs not hideous looking, but not hot either imo.  He‚Äôs a tall muscular jock type, I‚Äôm petite and somewhat twinkish, but average looking.  Not really my type."
259,Dont worry this trip was like 10 years ago
260,My straight very Christian friend let me suck his dick when he‚Äôs horny. I bet you bro. üòõ
261,"Engaged and have a kid, sorry haha."
262,"Yes.

It‚Äôs why I stopped hook ups. They are largely unsatisfying and the possibility of getting HIV for life from a short encounter that wasn‚Äôt even that great is very unappealing to me.

That being said... if a guy is HIV positive, I wouldn‚Äôt mind dating them."
263,"You need to put ""‚Ä¢ Stop isolating myself, make new friends, and construct a functioning social life"" on your agenda, and circle it with a red pen so you know it's important."
264,Over 9000
265,"I don't think that anywhere in my post I was saying that recent negative tests give carte blanche to sexual practices.  My point is simply that starting a potential relationship with a lie is ~~not really the best way~~ a shitty to go about things.

Being HIV+ wouldn't be a deal breaker for me.  However, knowing that you are and lying when asked directly about your STI status would be.  Make sense?"
266,When guys started gassing up my bubble booty and my great blowjob skills .
267,They realized that women drool over it too
268,"No, BDSM is *consensual.*"
269,"&gt; and a dog that only occasionally pisses on the carpet.

I lol'd."
270,"Also using always condom how the hell is this true. If the person knew they had hiv wouldn't they seek treatment. The story is probably fake and doesn't help with the stigma,it enforces it."
271,Wtf
272,Captain‚Äôs ass was the best part of the film üëåüèª
273,Could you imagine if he meant to? What a power move.
274,"nah... not particularly. I know that reaction you're talking about though. I think the ones I really appreciate are the people that just don't even skip a beat - Like - the lady at the DMV who told me she was sure my girlfriend appreciated me cooking for her, I told her (and this seems so cringe in retrospect, but also I was like 19 and I was barely out of the closet) ""Actually, I'm gay!""

And in the *exact* same tone of voice, she was just like, ""Oh, well I'm sure your boyfriend appreciates you cooking for him."" And then basically was like ""Here's the form you need, hon."" Those are my favorites."
275,I‚Äôm not very educated on stds I thought HIV was really bad? O:
276,"I‚Äôm 25 going on 26, and I‚Äôve come to realize that I think I do"
277,"&gt;  it'd be disgusting and creepy as fuck if some 25 or 26 year old teacher didn't keep his distance from a 15 or 16 year old

Except they‚Äôre 34 and 24.

zzz try again pls."
