0,"You did the right thing to walk away immediately. And if it's any consolation, be glad it wasn't 15 years. Or 20 that he threw away. Relationships are hard. I became single a few years ago and I don't think I can do it again."
1,Maybe you should find him
2,"So if you were straight and brought two girls to a party do you think these people would not just ask the exact same question? 

Sounds to me like you are being treated just like any other straight guy who brings a girl around. "
3,"re:  and now youre just acting like somehow I'm rude for wanting to stop people from touching me if I'm not into it.

i object to your characterization that i'm suggesting you're rude. you're not rude but merely misunderstanding the opportunity/fun that steamworks affords and the rules which apply. i've read all the comments to your posting and it seems that, the heat notwithstanding, we've all identified you as a newbie and are offering suggestions/thoughts to be helpful because we, ourselves, were newbies once.  of course you're free to argue and deflect but, ultimately, you're likely to be happier complying with the rules/etiquette or going elsewhere. again, sincerest good luck. chicago's a fun town and it's facing a weather warm-up now."
4,Yep! Imma ask him out lol. I dont think my gut is wrong this time 
5,He once said it‚Äôd be a ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù after I asked him if he‚Äôs seeing anyone.
6,Smart choice.
7,What happened to your hole?
8,"I understand that, however I just think it's disingenuous to say that trans POC led the movement when they are a small minority within a minority of a bar whose clientele was described as 98% gay men. 

I think they deserve credit for their contributions, but we don't need to exaggerate things.  "
9,Smart move üëçüèª the motel 6 was a warning for sure 
10,"First?  Ganondorf from OoT or Ryu from Street Fighter.  More recently Gladio from FFX, Cullen from DA:I, and Sidon from BotW."
11,"You definitely need to talk it all through with him. Sometimes this can be hard, especially if you really like someone. But the truth will come out sooner or later. Be that on the phone, at the bar, or in his bed. Your choice, but which scenario do you think will go most smoothly? "
12,"It is crucial that we can hold empathy for others in this way. Although these things are entirely different, being able to compare them in order to see how others think is a difficult but necessary skill to master. 

What u/frog-song is saying is not that these are the same thing, only that the way we see one of these is the same as how some others see the other one. 

The application of this method of deep empathy will Benefit anyone massively and allow them to become a kinder and more empathetic person. If we always look at something as it is instead of looking at how others see it, we will never understand their actions and opinions regarding it. "
13,When he tells you.   I know so many guys that I would never have guessed are gay.
14,No...my now ex used to look at memes together in bed before passing out 
15,Marital rape is illegal here. If your partner doesn't consent you can be charged with rape. In the states you can rape your partner. And we arent talking about a married couple. We're talking about someone coming up and grabbing my dick in a sauna. I should be allowed to say no. How the hell is that up for debate?!?!
16,"But truthfully, don't sex always rank extremely high in a relationship? :/"
17,"I became so used to being dumped/rejected/ ghosted that i put an iron skin lol. so if i do unfortunately get dumped. They just don't exist to me anymore. 
So yes friends is 100% out of the question. I cut them off right there (and i let them know)"
18,he deleted it his SO found this post 
19,"Idk about that first part - if they receive the first message and don't answer, assume they're not interested for whatever reason. Double messaging honestly just seems desperate and I feel like if the person does respond after that it would only be bc they feel guilty"
20,You locked them so obviously the apps wont be able to find them?
21,"So... once he crosses that graduation stage it‚Äôs suddenly okay for him to bang a 24 year old? Again, seems a strange standard."
22,None of the lads in the gym look gay lol
23,Show them the pics
24,Rich people do scummy things. In other news water is wet 
25,"Dude can you not read, half the pics are in the main gallery yet still cant be seen"
26,"Honestly, it's not justified you have nothing to be ashamed of my dude."
27,"I go to Watergarden in San Jose a few times a month.   This particular bath house is clean, friendly, with a very diverse clientele.    People have been universally respectful and always respond to ""no"" or ""not now"".   Watergarden has a large spa that seats 17 and it is a popular place, along with the steam room (which I don't like because it is too hot).  A pool table, lounge area, video room along with the rental rooms.  What I love about the place is that, for reasons I don't totally understand, my inhibitions and typical body consciousness stay in the locker with my clothing, and once I wrap a towel around my waist I feel remarkably free and unselfconscious.

You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.   I think you'll have a good time ticking off that bucket list item."
28,"Pay attention now you bunch of whores: literally every study that I have ever seen on the subject of the number of **lifetime** sexual partners gives an average number of 15 or less; considerably less when they do things to ensure honesty.
Fucking 100 guys is not normal, it is not healthy in the physiological sense,  it is not healthy in the mental sense, it is often the result of mental issues, and it is not good in cultural sense (i.e. the type of culture such behaviour creates is awful).
Yes, I am slut-shaming you and I'm doing it because there comes a point when that behaviour becomes necessary, and gay culture is so far pass that point that it can't see that fucking point even in the rear-view mirror anymore."
29,Not much tbh. So probably it's all my fault lmao
30,"I think you just have you stop seeing him, and eventually the feelings will fade. It's going to suck for a while but the sooner you move on the sooner you'll be over him. "
31,Care to give us any tips?
32,Sometimes. Constant rejection is a sting that has lead me to just be quiet most of the time. 
33,"OK, two years. That's not long. If you feel that way about it, time to break up.


Are you offering anything to get him off the laptop? Could you maybe initiate something?
"
34,He probably got HIV from having group sex . I know someone who got it from that. The participants should be on prep. Technically it‚Äôs not his job for him to inform them to be safe even if his intentions are mentally malicious 
35,"Some of the colleges mentioned are not even that competitive to get into, but I guess if your wealthy, it takes less effort to bribe someone than to have your kid actually study."
36,why they don't understand that there's no such thing as gay people who are sexually attracted to the opposite sex i have no fucking idea
37,"But a gay is in it, that means its amazing by default."
38,"There are all kinds of books pushing all kinds of philosophies and ideas.   Not what I would read, or recommend.  But other than that, so what?"
39,You're not wrong; I had a job last year and got so much more work done as it forced me to be more organized. 
40,Nope.
41,"&gt;or use condoms whether at a sex party or not.

That was the point I was making with ""I'd recommend using condoms"".


&gt;Having sex with someone at a sex party, protected or not, is just as risky as having sex with a stranger you meet anywhere else.

I didn't say anything denying that. It's not the risk from each individual participant, it's the collective risk that is much greater.

In total, going to a sex party *is* riskier than just having sex with one person. Sure each individual encounter at a sex party is no more risky than another (in average), but in total, there is more risk involved with going to sex parties than hooking up with one person."
42,Sweet!!
43,"10 days? Bitch, I can't get over my ex and it has been two years. "
44,"Here's some of mine:

- underwear ripping
- taking a sweaty pair of underwear and wearing it around your neck feels slutty and nice
- piss play: piss on eachother, in eachother's asses, piss your underwear, pants, speedos if you have, of course you can also drink it, but I must warn you that it might taste like shit
- outdoors in nature is nice, but exercise caution, both about other people and animals. I personally only like to do it in the winter and early spring, because in the summer and autumn there are bugs and snakes where I live. Where you live it might differ of course."
45,"Im on the island of ireland somewhere, yes üòÇ"
46,2-3 times a day.....
47,Thank you! We love sniffing each other‚Äôs days old sweaty underwear. The musk always gets me so fucking hard. We are curious about piss play will probably try that soon.
48,"Over the past three years I'm probably near triple digits but one of those years I was exclusive with an ex. I lost count after 50 when I was 19.  
I don't really think any number is too many as long as you can still be intimate with a partner when it is meaningful and your social life isn't all about hookups"
49,How do you it? The updates are annoying?
50,"Aw, he could have been a nice guy. You probably hurt his feelings. "
51,"This.  When they say you are ""faking it"" just roll your eyes and laugh."
52,yeah i prefer to see face and body gives a sketch vibe sometimes
53,Mostly the ones that emigrated do but in turkey itself they are getting more religious. 
54,"I think this is the tip of the iceberg, and when all is exposed there will be big problems for most of the ""prestigious"" universities when rejected candidates file their mountains of lawsuits."
55,Maybe because you look fem?
56,"Hahaha, that made me laugh...what're you doing to reduce the pain though?"
57,"mine always said they loved and accepted me for my ‚Äúchoice.‚Äù.   instead bought all was well.   my brother and father would vacation with me and my partner and i/we would visit my family back east a couple of times a year.   that all changed when we got married and i found out they had really considered me a second class citizen all that time, unworthy and unequal in their eyes.   i‚Äôm happily married but sadly am no longer involved in my extended family‚Äôs lives."
58,Sex is sex. 
59,". . .When I moved to the island of St Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, I learned that, being there on that tiny spit of land, a thousand + miles from home, we made Our Own Families.
    Most of the people who live there do not have their full families there.  We had all become our own families.  
     And yes, we still loved our stateside families, but we dealt day-to-day with the island folks we were around daily.  We all looked out for each other.
     So I'm not saying move to an island, I'm saying that you can always make your own ""family"" as you go thru life.  For some people, who are not even gay, the people closest to them in their lives are not blood-relations, but the real, true friends who would ALWAYS be there. 
     Hit me up if you ever want to talk.  I KNOW this is not an easy time.  It will almost be like a death, so you need to understand the various emotions you may go thru. 
    Wishing you peace, my friend."
60,Locking eyes with another guy. Looking at crotches.
61,"You need to realize that they loved the fake person you created. A image crafted by you to conceal your true self. 

Loving a lie who‚Äôs not you is the same as them knowing the true you and not loving it. You didn‚Äôt lose anything. "
62,"Most ""traps"" are actually femboys who identify as boys.

The girls are transgender."
63,Are you Irish by any chance lol? 
64,Why do you ask
65,Fair. :| I'm trying to learn to let go. I'm trying...but it's taking me a lot longer than 3 minutes.
66,"It doesn't bother me at all. Their opinions don't directly affect me, and it's not like they to out of their way to tell me I'm ""inferior."" If they think marriage should be between a man and a woman, so be it. I don't expect them to drop an entire religion because I'm gay. "
67,"Unplug the internet.
"
68,Sounds like you may need to end it if he is going to treat you that way then. 
69,Who said it was easy lol
70,Not very suprising
71,Get a boyfriend and prove them wrong
72,Not much you can do about that. I suppose when you‚Äôve been married to a man for 20 years they might start to reconsider.
73,"They are not in the secure folder, I also took pics with the camera as is, grindr cannot see any camera roll or gallery albums"
74,True blood
75,"Or before he starts to think you're just messing with him.

The worst he can say is no."
76,"In one of my first hookups a guy suggested to smoke tina, and I didn't know what it was, thought it's some kind of herbals or something. Since I never smoke, I declined, but then I found out its meth - lesson learned!"
77,"No. I find it hard to be friends with other gay people, typically. Almost all my friends are straight men, with a few straight women. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most of my gay friendships implode within a couple of months. "
78,"Go to sleep earlier, wake up earlier, start your day earlier, use your extra time for finding dates instead of hookups. "
79,Leave him
80,*colleague 
81,"I'm the same way. The guys that find it off-putting most likely wouldn't be a good match, anyway.

Not to judge, but a pretty large portion of guys on the apps for whatever reasons don't actually follow through with anything off the app. And honestly it's worse on dating apps compared to hook up apps.

It saves so much time to focus on guys on the other end of the spectrum.

Also, I'm naturally indecisive in just about every other aspect of my life lol. Neither of us will enjoy it if I have to carry the lion's share of making moves and decisions."
82,"The summer???1?1?!?

Jeez just pencil him in for the second coming of christ.

In all seriousness, things gotta happen chop chop. Otherwise the ball deflates, the balloon doesn't float, and no one passes Go to collect two hundred dollars."
83,I rarely do.  üòÖ
84,"Then offer to help him study in your shared class. Offer to let him sleep over if you end up ""studying"" too late. "
85,Sorry but this gave me a good laugh. Next time have a wank.
86,"I kinda like having my dick held while I piss. That‚Äôs more down to me being very lazy, though. "
87,"Great list. I would argue that his executive experience, while on paper doesn't sound great, when verbalized actually is pretty amazing. I never gave a thought to mayors being serious candidates until I heard Pete and the mayor of Louisville discuss public policy and **the tangible/immediate effects** of said policy.

88,Hahahah ill try to get him out mid exams
89,Sounds like someone with far too much time on their hands 
90,"No ass stubble, ever."
91,Last guy I dated asked me to meet up pretty quickly. Like within the first 5 messages.  I was hesitant but I'm glad I did. We ended up going out for a few months. Only ended because he got serious with another guy he was seeing. Oh well ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
92,"Listen dude. You want to fight. I don't. People got defensive over their space and made it clear it wasn't my space. One guy had to put ""you don't belong there"" in every comment because he was dying to say that to someone. The vibe from how people talked to me in this post told me what I needed to know: that I would have a bad time there. Why are you chasing me down when I decided to stop questioning how people liked their consent and put a firm boundary around mine. You're so angry that I don't like how they fuck. You think I think I'm better than everyone else. I don't. I just know I have boundaries and people here are livid that they're different from the masses. Can you accept that? Can you let me not like what I've seen and let me choose other space? Regardless of your answer, thanks for the info. People were super descriptive and I need no other info. Good night."
93,Into it. Guys need to do more of this.
94,"I‚Äôm glad, I could bring you joy. I think I‚Äôm going to remain celibate for the foreseeable future lol. "
95,Buy a large rubber cock toy to use on him. 
96,Unless you grew up under communism it is just religion that causes homophobia. The vast majority of the world was not a victim of communist homophobia so in fact religion is mostly to blame. 
97,It makes me happy too. I feel warm seeing a gay couple out in public. I try to give them the biggest smile I can to let them know I am happy for them. I hope one day I can be in a relationship and be as happy as I've seen gay couples be. 
98," Brown stuff was most likely gingivitis fruiting bodies, your dick might fall off in the next few weeks."
99,We went out for lunch a couple days ago. I really wanna take him someplace tho. You think it‚Äôs weird if I ask if I can take him out? Without sounding like a date? Don‚Äôt wanna scare the poor thing away ya know 
100,"Awesome! He likes you too! Now just keep doing ""casual"" things like putting your hand on his back as you look at the same book etc. Or mention how much you enjoy his company. Slowly get more intimate and pay attention to how he responds. "
101,"Dude. People explaining the nature of a particularly cruisy event at a bath house doesn't mean that they agree with those standards of consent for themselves.

Most people responding to you probably have ideas and boundaries around consent much closer to yours. Stop acting like you're unique in this thread or among gay men in general for having the most common standards of consent.

The whole existence of a special event that a minority of customers of a specific venue that the vast majority of gay men have no desire to go to just goes to show that that level of implies consent and groping is exceedingly uncommon."
102,As of 41 days ago you were a conservative cuck. This harms your chances. 
103,"That was a friend of mine actually, I hate that I didn't clarify that lmao :/"
104,Yes. Save yourself the trouble if over thinking it. 
105,"Yeah, I feel like that's what needs to happen. Thank you."
106,I really hope that‚Äôs not becoming the norm? It‚Äôs too confusing. 
107,It was that plus OP's would've-been hookup being winded af on god knows what drug. Could've been bath salts or smn ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
108,If you advertise yourself as a TGirl you will attract the guys who like that.  It's a niche for sure as you can tell by the answers here
109,"Urethras may dribble a bit after a pee, but tampons and cups do go inside yknow"
110,"I don‚Äôt even know their names, let alone their jobs. "
111,"There were so many parts of this movie where I wanted to literally stand up, throw my popcorn at the screen and scream ""JUST FUCKING KISS ALREADY!"""
112,"I like those names in english, but absolutely hate them in my native language."
113,"If you're on the apps like Grindr, Growlr etc, you may have something on your profile that hints ""Dating only, no hookups"" and most people on those apps want hookups. Leave the apps and go out instead."
114,"If he's really a nice guy then you shouldn't worry about it. I believe you can bring it up when the chat goes slightly sexual and ask if he's experience or not, then you get your chance to do it."
115,Yes this association is something that I hate. The whole lgbtqi~ group of people is annoying and hard for me to like. 
116,I have been off sex for 4 years now. That's because I've always waited for the right guy in the right circumstances. For once I've tried to go the 'instinctive' route. That doesn't make me panicky...
117,"I wouldn't necessarily say that I brag about it, but I am more likely to mention their job in conversation. When I met up with a surgeon a few times, it was one of the first things that I would mention to other friends about him. Whereas I doubt I would ever mention their career if it was something mediocre like a hairdresser. "
118,"Being closeted in a conservative area, I know what trying to cope with the stigma is like. However, do what you think is best, don‚Äôt go planning ahead of time. A relationship will come when it comes, don‚Äôt try to rush it. Anyway, good luck going forward! (I wish I was as lucky as you in the first place in terms of being with guys, you‚Äôre going good) Remember that your journey is yours and nothing is guaranteed."
119,"First of all, it's **LGBTQ+**.

Second, you seem to have a lot of hate for something that you don't even understand. Transgenderism is what happens when a person's brain recognizes their gender as something that is not their biological sex. Teenagers generally aren't allowed to undergo surgery to correct their gender until they are old enough to be able to consent to their own medical procedures. 

Maybe you should actually learn about something before dismissing it with nothing but your own feelings, which mean absolutely nothing to anyone."
120,That list of times you tried to have sex sounds like a real turn on. A real sexy move.
121,Diaper boy
122,Cody Johnson - Guilty as Charged 
123,"Easiest way is to wank him off whilst you're pounding his ass. Ultimately it will be hard for him not to cum (in my experience). If he's enjoying the pounding as much as he should be, the overload of senses will cause an amazing orgasm for him. 
Tell him you really want to be covered in his cum, it's a massive turn on for you etc. 

Have him flat on his back or if he wants to be on top, facing you so you have easier access to his dick.
Try to get a rhythm and focus on him and it'll happen.

Side note, if he cums first his body will go hypersensitive and you might find he can't bottom after that. So you might have to accept that if he's gonna cum 1st, you might have to finish yourself off.

As someone else said, you will not likely make someone cum hands-free. It's not something everyone can do and those that can don't always.  (I've only cum hands-free once in 7yrs of gay sex)

The most important thing is that he's actually enjoying the experience though, and not just pretending to. Have an open, honest conversation about what it's like for him"
124,I guess things have changed over the years.  Something like 10 years ago I visited a gay friend who lived close to DuPont Circle and we saw obvious gay couples all over the place.
125,"Hate pet names.  If I hear another couple using them (especially constantly) I feel like they are forcing the relationship, it feels to fake"
126,"I mean... 'Gays' has been used as an umbrella term for a long times now. It's not a new thing, mostly I heard people use 'gay' as an umbrella term in a non serious contexts or as a kind of meme language like 'The gays win again!' or 'This is the gays agenda!' or 'us gays', and it usually comes with a context so it's not that confusing. I don't think 'gay' will be taken from us, homosexual men, anytime soon. So calm down people, there's no need to be panic. "
127,Well yeah he's just being nice on some level but as a former bartender I can attest it's not uncommon to give the tip to someone you got tipped by know what I mean? Just stop overthinking and have at it.
128,Society hates us anyway so I don't care for their values anymore - society is so hypocritical and you as a gay shouldn't talk like this about your own kind!
129,"Next time you think he‚Äôs flirting with you, break the ice and ask ‚Äúare you flirting with me?‚Äù, all playful like. It‚Äôll take whatever pressure there is off you two and there‚Äôs no where to go but up from there lol."
130,Especially when they're not up front about it. Why would I want to sleep with a dude who's already being shady about his drug use? People in here acting like smoking crack is like having milk in your tea.. smdh. 
131,Good. Call.

134,"If I want to switch out gay and bisexual I am in my own right to.

And not seeing how it is erasure to use both.

However, you are a sad man I hope you get help. And probably stay away from pride or safe spaces. I can only imagine how much you harass people questioning their sexual orientation. "
135,"Okay, good to know. No, I don't use it. Mostly because it's known as a hookup app and I don't have the body for that and know every gay in my town. I've tried it before, and the tourists that have come here have been gone and just ghosted be by the time I found them. But maybe it's an option... "
136,Well if he knows how you feel then there's no way you can really lead him on honestly. He knows what's on your mind and that's what's important.
137,"Lol, I'm the reverse. Moaning is hot and means I'm hitting the right spots; confidence grows and I cum faster.

Him saying he wants me to cum tells me that he wants it to end soon and put pressure on me to finish quickly, achieving the exact opposite."
138,Good boy. Your safety should always be your priority
139,Grow up little boy üôÑ
140,"It is hard to believe for those who have not experienced such thing; I told my friend who's been in a stable relationship for 7 years about the story, and her only response was 'be realistic and snap out of it'. I guess love chemistry and feelings can quite literally happen in any circumstances, which makes it both wonderful and awful depending on how you look at it. Nevertheless, best of luck!"
141,"I grew up in an area where ""queer"" is still used by older people in the original sense, and people would be described as queer if they were ""a bit off, weird, something not quite right about them"" etc rather than sexuality, so I personally refuse to adopt such a weighted term for the community myself.

It is silly for ""gay"" to apply to all LGBT because not all LGBT is about sexuality.

As a trainer I've argued that if anything the T needs to be separated more (we use LGB+T) because it often makes people we train confused about the difference between sex and gender identity."

Good. Stay mad.
144,omg I fucking love this subreddit lmfao 
145,The gay guys you are talking about have families too. Many of them have been disowned. I am from a very conservative country. Be thankful to these gay guys that come out. Spread the message. Or otherwise please exchange your life with mine for a week. You will know
146,"Yeah that's right. It can start with chatting, you may start to get friendly with them, the convo may turn a little steamier. You may be able to set up a date for later on"
147,"I'm not opposed to a more exclusive LGB oriented sub (in a sense AGB is one of these), but going out of your way to basically cut the T part out altogether explicitly in the sidebar? Not a good idea."
148,"&gt;	Am i out of options for gay dating?

Pretty much, unless you live in a gayborhood. The guys on bumble and tinder are pretty much the same guys on Grindr "
149,It's your mind. Do whatever you want there.
150,I've had so many bad dates with hair stylists that if I find out they work as a hair stylist I just move on. 
151,"Dont mention offing himself pls.   Op/Dude, there are a number of people here that feel your struggle and will support encourage u.  There's value in it.

Me 6 yrs ago vs now, I'm better out and real, rgen fake and hiding. No contact with many ppl now but I'm better off vs hiding."
152,I don‚Äôt really wait. I analyze their reaction when I ask them if they want to fuck
153,Would you say gay men on tinder are generally nicer than on Grindr?
154,Normal? Yes. Average? No.
155,Don‚Äôt you tell them in the first minute?
156,most males are like 170cm or taller by that age
157,"strike while the iron's hot.  If you're both available, do it."

159,"The argument is watertight. The details are hazy. 

That doesn't mean that the details will turn out to contradict... simply that there's a wide range that we haven't narrowed down yet. "
160,Fair enough. However how can you gauge their reaction when they don't respond...
161,"I think what you should aim for is narrow waist but broad/wide chest, that‚Äôs hot af. "
162,"You didn't make the choice...they did

And times heals every scar. As one of the comments say you were sitting on a tickling bomb..the sooner it goes off..the more time you have to rebuild...the later it goes off the more time and efforts you waste.

And you have your boyfriend standing with you !! Remember most of the gay guys on the planet don't get what you have !! They are dying in closet, in denial, and in pain."

It‚Äôs not a choice for a great majority in any case. The fact that people actually still believe that is abhorrent to me. "
180,"Yeah, but their reputation is pretty bad, and your mileage **definitely** will vary.

(Ignore the rest of this if it doesn't apply to you.)

I do have to say that for many people who don't react well to people who don't drink it's because they've heard lots of people who don't drink make really judgmental comments about people who do.

Usually it's completely unintentional things like, ""I don't need to get wasted to have fun,"" or, ""I just don't want to put poison in my brain.""

Saying those things to someone with a beer in their hand is sort of shitty."
198,"I‚Äôm flexible 50/50 versatile and have a bigger penis than most.  I‚Äôm also white and have Aspergers for more context.

I don‚Äôt even think I‚Äôm that big, but the first times I sent pictures of my penis to some guys on Grindr, I began to notice a consistent affirmation of my penis sometimes calling out it‚Äôs size specifically, other times that I‚Äôm uncut (I live in the U.S.) or have a nice shape or curve.  I was 21 and at first the affirmation felt nice, but after a while I realized it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm not used to getting affirmation, especially sexual affirmation so directly.  As time went on, appreciation directed squarely at my dick started to put me off.  

Eventually, I met with one guy and felt like I was his sex toy.  I was still 21 and it was my first time having sex or kissing a guy.  He was terrible at kissing and sex didn‚Äôt even feel good through the whole thing.  He just rushed everything and I felt like he just wanted to use my body without much care for anything else.  He came really fast (~10 minutes), leaving me to jerk as fast as possible (I didn‚Äôt want to not orgasm for him) and get out of there.

Now, oddly enough, I only send pictures of my penis to guys I have no intention of hooking up with.  I get being attracted to a penis or any part of a guy sexually, but if his attractions are not grounded in a more total attraction for me (and vise versa), I have no interest in sex with him.  I might as well just jerk off instead."

Did discrimination exist in the past regarding college admission? Yes? Does it exist now?  Absolutely not.  Affirmative action exists (purportedly) to make colleges more inclusive and reflective of society.   To do so standards are lowered for black and Latino students, thus taking merit partially out of the equation. Why you find this fact so upsetting is bizarre. 

The cognitive dissonance POC display with respect to affirmative action astounds me.  POC loudly and without reservation demand affirmative action.  Then when someone acknowledges that those policies are responsible for their admission to elite schools they feign outrage at having their accomplishments questioned.  Can‚Äôt have it both ways.

Black people literally demand  affirmative action then feign outrage when someone points out that they benefited from it.  It‚Äôs comical how frequently you see people trying to have it both ways on this matter.

Also your percentages are not accurate.  Google Harvard demographics for instance .  43% of the student body is white - well below the US population. Closer to 17% are black and Latino, and this excludes foreign nationals. "

I've also avoided using my magnifying mirror as much, as picking can really make things worse."
217,"Copying from a comment I made on another post... 

My husband and i haven't had sex in about 10 years. Antidepressants killed my sex drive, and we have some sexual incompatibility. He is into kink/bdsm, and I'm not. He also has a very high sex drive, but for a few years he went without because our relationship is very important to us both. We love each other and can't imagine going through life without each other. The lack of sex sucked for him, but it wasn't enough for him to want to end our relationship. 

But it did wear on him. He felt like there was something wrong with him, that he was ugly and undesirable. A few years ago I suggested he get sex outside the relationship. We talked it through and eventually he did. He now has a few guys he regularly has sex with. 

It may sound counterintuitive, but our relationship is BETTER now because he no longer has the underlying resentment about us not having sex, and I no longer have guilt about not fulfilling his sexual needs. And he has become more confident because he has found that there are plenty of guys who are interested in him."

In my opinion, beard oils are **at best** a form of deodorizer, and at worst a full-blown marketing scam. Hair is protein. There are things that you can do to it to denaturalize it (or ‚Äúdry it out‚Äù like applying high heat, general aging of hair strands, radiation/sun damage). But you cannot ‚Äúmoisturize‚Äù (beard)hair or do anything that most beard oils try to subtly tell you they‚Äôre doing. You also cannot make hair ‚Äúsofter‚Äù unless you cake on a fuck ton of gunk. In which case that‚Äôs all you‚Äôre feeling is the gunk.
