0,"You may have to play along until you can afford to move out.

Don't become homeless by choice. The options you're being given are not fair and, essentially, cruel but this is life, unfortunately.

Unless you have another living option, tell your dad what he needs to hear and then your singular focus is your financial freedom.

No coffees, no fast food, no nights out.

You only spend money on absolute necessities. Every dime you earn has a purpose. Bills and savings.

You only pay for what you need and you save like a crazy miser waiting on Armageddon.

Once you have your freedom, you live your life and never look back.

This will require patience and discipline. Treat this as a learning and personal growth opportunity. Don't tip your hand, keep your emotions in check, you need to stay cool and calculated throughout this whole process, no matter how long it takes.

Good luck!"
1,"This is funny as shit but i know its embarassing lol ""right in front of my salad"". "
2,I just wish I could be ‚Äòballs deep‚Äô in gay *anything* at this dry stage.
3,"people who say ""i hate the sin but love the sinner"" are lying. I've known that since childhood.

anyway sin is a christian problem and since im not one, i don't have to worry about it. "
4,"First, you‚Äôre an awesome parent. Secondly, don‚Äôt overcomplicate this. You don‚Äôt need to force him to admit anything he‚Äôs clearly confused about. Just stick with affirmation. Try to make it a point to point out when LGBT people (news, media, etc) do something positive and talk about how you admire them. Normalize LGBT for him. That way when he figures out his orientation (whatever it will be) he‚Äôll have a positive opinion and an easier time accepting himself if he‚Äôs gay. "
5,"Well shit. Y'all are a negative bunch. No fake girlfriend's, he may have already knew but I'm sharing a triumph because my BF is at work and we can't talk about it. Thanks for the positive posts but also these OTHER comments is why I'm a first time poster. I'm just trying to be happy about not being disowned. "
6,Yeah I‚Äôm very scared of becoming that old gay guy on Grindr messaging guys in their 20s and getting blocked. 
7,"I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you. Thank fuck you‚Äôve got your brother. Stay strong dude, things will get better. You‚Äôve got your whole life ahead of you and it sounds like it‚Äôll be better for her not being in it. I‚Äôm a huge believer in found family. The people who love and support you aren‚Äôt always the ones you‚Äôre connected to by blood "
8,Ughhh i‚Äôm so excited for you !!!!!
9,"# how can I help him BE gay?

&amp;#x200B;

Peg him and hard "
10,"The moment right before he cums where he looks happy so I can pretend like this is real, like we may have a future together, like I‚Äôm not on a mattress on the ground trying to keep my voice down so his roommates don‚Äôt wake up."
11,"I have grandsons older than you, but your experience here takes me back to my youth.  I am at my first duty assignment in the military at a time when they are still taking us gays off to military prison.  Folks at that assignment began figuring out that I was not dating the girls, and began circling like wolves, and gossiping.  In those times this was truly dangerous for a gay man.

Well, this guy, who was a dedicated church going man, and straight as an arrow came to my rescue.  I had always figured him for the guy who would lead the lynch party.  Well he starts going on and on loudly about how he can't get any work done on the evening shift (when he carried our section alone) due to all the ladies coming by and asking after me.  He really bitches at me to let them know I have been changed to the morning shift.  The next day, as he was coming on shift for the night, and I was leaving, he gave me this sweet smile, and winked at me.

In life, people will often surprise you.  Love and friendship will come from those you least expect, and sadly, the reverse as well.  Those you would expect to stand up for you are no where to be found when the stuffing hits the fan.  I'm a white haired old coot now, but some of the sweetest guys I have known along the way were straight men who had loving hearts."
12,"Dude just talk to her about it, it could potentially be an awkward:embarrassing moment you guys have inside jokes about and the start of an entirely new and closer bond with your mother after you guys discuss sex, expectations. Don‚Äôt put it off"
13,Oh yeah time to cut links with this toxic person.
14,"Interesting.

I came out in 1994 at the age of 21.  I was as seemingly straight as they came.  6'4"" 195lbs with broad shoulders.  Cowboy boots, jeans, T-Shirt, leather jacket type.  I was an out of place country boy that migrated to a city.
Nobody could tell.  And it was lovely as hell.

Once I finally met and made friends with some actual gay guys, I felt like I HAD TO act more effeminate because otherwise guys weren't getting the hint.  And back then you needed a pretty damn good hint.  I always felt I had to force acting more effeminate than I felt.  Like I had to do that to attract guys.  It really sucked.  "
15,I love stories like this! It's good cause I can think that maybe someday I'll be in a similar position. Thanks for sharing!
16,"I wholeheartedly appreciate this advice. Drastic times call for drastic measures. I have to realize that my life, my happiness, and my peace of mind is more important than anyone even my parents. And if I have to end those relationships then so be it. Thank you so much for this. üíØüíØ‚ù§Ô∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà"
17,"cuddling first with clothes on, then the inevitable naked contact, especially the groin area. The warmth.."
18,Share some tips on how to suck a dick
19,I hate that this made me LOL. 
20,i loathe that filter so much. 
21,"Dont be afraid to use your tongue. Move to a song in your head. Change the pace go slow and speed up at random. Listen to the guy and pay attention to body language. Dont stare! Unless he likes it... I find it awkward. Pretend like his dick is the best thing in the world... find a ""finisher"" move that is guaranteed to make a guy cum. I'd tell you mine but it's a bit complicated to explain through text :/ but with it I can make a guy cum in seconds if he just wanted a quick nut. All of the guys I've blown have said that I'm one of the best they'd had and one gave me the nickname ""head doctor"" üòÅ"
22,Bisexual dudes exist ya know...
23,It‚Äôs just such an unattractive filter. I mean why in your right mind would you make yourself look like a dog? Isn‚Äôt that supposed to be an insult? Ugh people.
24,Too many bottoms for you to handle?
25,"Imagine how you‚Äôd feel if this were reversed.....nobody wants to walk in on their mom being plowed or being cum shot in the face.....that would be kinda scaring actually. So yeah she‚Äôs feeling the way she is. 
Might wanna say hey sorry I wasn‚Äôt more careful with privacy and respecting boundaries won‚Äôt happen again. But don‚Äôt expect things to smooth over right away, they will eventually but it‚Äôll probably just take time for things to get back more normal."
26,"1. Contact your local public library. Ask what resources there are in your community for LGBT youth.

2. Your school probably has some kind of counseling service for students. Find out if that's a thing, and how to avail yourself of it.

3. Get lots of rest. Stress depletes you, and you'll need more sleep and downtime to avoid getting sick. Remember to eat, and drink lots of water.

4. If you have other family (biological or not) who will be supportive, connect with them any way you can.

5. Remember you're not alone. There are millions of your LGBTQIA family just waiting to embrace you whenever you're ready.

6. Laugh. Laughter is healing. Watch funny movies and listen to standup comedies and seek out hilarious videos on Tiktok. 

7. If you're in the mood for company, cling to your friends. 

8. Don't use risky sex or overeating or chemical substances to shore up your self-esteem. You deserve the real thing--by which I mean, you deserve to esteem yourself. 

9. You did a badass thing, walking out of that hateful environment. Be proud of that. Hold your head high and don't let anybody make you feel bad for preserving your integrity.

10. Know that we are rooting for you. Come here for advice. Listen to advice ... but only take the advice that makes sense to you. Nobody knows *your* situation better than you do.
"
27,I knew I was gay at 6 so I don't know why these people are giving you crap. Probably not best to talk to anyone about it until he tells you he's sure he's gay/bi/whatever for sure. The religion thing is so terrible. Anything that has a little boy crying because he feels like he's wrong is obnoxious. If grandma told him it's a sin she probably not going to be a great person for him to be around. Good for you to look out for him without judgement. 
28,Isn't that what boyfriend are for? Copping a feel whenever the mood hits.
29,"You will find a lot of gay men have similar stories. We have been building our own families for a long time. In fact, it is to be common to hear ""keeping it in the family"" from all sorts of us in public. This was generally in reference to one gay man doing a kindness or something helpful for another. Think going into a coffee shop and the person hands you a coffee and says ""It's on me, just keeping it in the family."" It was a way for us to acknowledge and let each other know we're here for you.

If it helps, I moved out when I was 16. I already hadn't been speaking to father for two years, when I moved out I didn't speak to my mother for 4 years. She called and apologized for all the wrongs. I made up with her and we have a great relationship today. Twenty years later I had moved across the country, built my family of friends. I nearly died and had the realization in the hospital that if I made it out I needed to at least try to forgive my father and his side of the family. I still had contact with my aunt, I made my plans. I flew across the country and drove 8 hours to my home town. My aunt had gathered most of my father's side of the family at my grandparent's home. Only she knew I was coming. I stood outside that door for five minutes before ringing that bell. When I did, there was a lot of crying and happy faces. I got to meet nieces, nephew, second cousins, sisters in law and other new family members I had never known. My younger brother and I spent time making up and clearing up evil lies told about me all those years before. I had missed out on a lot.

You have a loving and supportive brother, be grateful for that. Build your own family from your friends. Be hurt, angry and grieve. You have every right. Try not to wait as long as I did to repair things. I regret missing out on that part of my life.

Also, I assume you're in high school and still a minor. Depending on where you live, you should go to your guidance counselor and explain the situation. It may end up hurting your mother now but it protect both you and your brother. Your mother sounds a little nuts, you don't don't want her calling the police and telling them your brother kidnapped you because you're in an incestuous relationship.

Lastly, your brothers and here for you."
30,"Thank you. As for normalizing it, he knows my gay friend is gay, but didn't realize my lesbian friend was, so I told him today. I also told him how they go to church together every Sunday. "
31,"I like being held, or have him lie on top of me. The warmth and feeling of safety is phenomenal."

35,"It‚Äôs better than being the old guy messaging 18 year olds and then if they don‚Äôt respond but don‚Äôt block also, continue sending them messages culminating in ‚Äòyou deserve acid you rude (insert any swear word or insult).‚Äô "
36,"Her view is as demented as a Christian who says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hate the Jews.  I just hate that they go to the synagogue.‚Äù

Being gay is fine. And doing gay things is fine, because being gay is fine, and gay people get to do gay things with other gay people. 

She is trying to market her hate as fair-minded compassion, and it‚Äôs just pure bullshit. 

And yes, I will blow my guy in her honour later today. "
37,Get out where? Nightclubs and bars? They just told you they're not in the scene. 
38,"You're a great brother for taking him in. Thank you for that.

I read the other post, and agree with most of the comments. You need to set boundaries, otherwise this could spiral out of control. Kids (and at 15, I would consider him a kid still), need boundaries to learn what is acceptable behavior, and what is not. 

At 15, I could never have brought a guy home and slept in the same bed. I wasn't even allowed to have my bedroom door closed!

It's an awkward situation for yourself, so do your homework, and let him know that you're always there for him, no matter what- but he needs to start showing respect for you and your space. Stick to the boundaries you set!"
39,"hey it‚Äôs great that you wanna come out but don‚Äôt do it if you think you might get kicked out/sent to conversion therapy or anything like that [unless you can support yourself &amp; move out or whatever]

it might be hard to not be who you are but there‚Äôs no point being yourself if you‚Äôre homeless or being emotionally and maybe even physically abused

either way good luck :)"

46,"So nobody is gonna point out how many gay people genuinely would let 14 werewolves bone them in public

Or participate in pup play "
47,"First of all, I want to pour praises all over you and your husband for you open attitude!

Then, I preface by saying I am not an expert, but I wonder if you need to give your son room to live through his school experience without over protecting him.   If and when bullying happens, that is the time to get heavily involved.   It hasn't happened yet.  One of the things to consider is how to help him get through the bullying experience.   I was bullied some, but not to an extreme level.  I knew my parents stood behind me, and that helped me a lot.

Secondly, back off him just a little bit.  He will reveal what he feels able to, when he is able to do it.  He knows you support him.  That's huge.  So many gay kids do not have that.

The church thing could become a problem.   It could end up being OK.  You can't select a church for him, but you can be there if it becomes a conflict for him.   Be ready to confront the grandparents, if, *and only if*, they make an issue of his sexuality or do the hellfire thing.

There is no way for you guys to guarantee a soft landing for your son.   He will, whether gay or straight, live through puberty, with all the angst and storm clouds that every kid goes through.  He will have to find his place in the social world of middle school then high school.

Be there to support him when he needs you.  Your love for your son is beyond question."
48,"Larger pride crowds

55,"I lay a significant amount of the blame for this on your parents.   Jeez, their son commits suicide and they go on about him having gay friends.  It's a cold, cruel world out there for a lot of people, and their safe space should be their family. That cold cruel world for your bro was school, but he couldn't even come home to peacefulness and unconditional love.  Izzy is a piece of garbage and I hope karma comes back to bite him in the ass hard, but your parents have a lot to own up to, and atone for.  Do they even seem like they are genuinely sad about your brother's death ?"

58,"I disagree with most of these comments. 


Look, it's a weird thing to see a family member getting splattered with cum.  She needs time.  Let her process.  Don't bring it up again, let her come to you with it. 


Sometimes people feel this overwhelming need to fix something... Except nothing here is broken.  Things will go back to normal, they just need time. 



And be more careful not to get caught in the future.  "

61,"These comments are depressingly shallow, telling you to ""upgrade yourself"" and ""hit the gym"". Your main concern should be about accepting who you are as a person. Listen to the reasons he tells you he loves you and be proud about them. 

The only person you need to care about loving you is yourself. Once you've achieved that, you will trust that your boyfriend feels the same. Otherwise, you'll be torturing yourself, chasing after a Chimera whilst eroding the trust between you and your boyfriend."

67,"She deliberately asked you for your opinion in a private setting, and when you gave it, decided to use that to humiliate you in public. You had nothing to apologize for. That girl is a bitch, who probably feels good about herself by putting others down."
68,In my experience I have found that guys who use the snapchat dog filter use it to hide certain facial features about themselves that they don't like or will seemingly stick out to other people. Usually when I press them to show other filterless pics they're usually hesitant and once they do send some 9/10 they either have an unusually big nose or just lose that cute look they're going for and look painfully average at best.
69,"Porn is a bit about fantasy so it‚Äôs hard to say based on that. I would try to talk to him and maybe incorporate some pegging into your sex life. Maybe he‚Äôs curious based on what his gay friends have said about bottoming/prostate stimulation.

86,"I am always amused by these posts about growing old usually posted by 20 somethings.  

I AM old, 71 this year.  I am gay and yes I am single but lonely, I am not.  You see I don't focus my energy on what I don't have, I focus it on what I do have.  

I have a beautiful house, nice art, enough money to live comfortably and lots and lots of options.  I am probably going to Alaska for a month this year.  My neighbors love my garden, I see them stopping and gazing at the beautiful flowers.  I have nice neighbors and a safe neighborhood.  

I have two friends who I have know for 40 and 45 years.  They have seen the good, the bad and the downright ugly and they still love me.  I've had 3 partners I was with for a total of 33 years, the one that is still alive I am still in contact with.  

I have Grindr, Scruff and Recon but except for Recon I mostly use them when I travel.  I get messaged on all of them numerous times a day but mostly from bots.  I have several FWBs and enjoy playing with them.  

I don't message 20 year olds, 25 year olds and rarely 30 year olds, I let them message me.  But quite frankly, I get enough sex.  I don't like meeting strangers much less having them in my house.  I'm a hung top living in a city that seems to be 97.3574% bottoms, so finding a fuck buddy isn't hard.  

Would I like another partner, maybe.  At this point in my life being comfortable is far more important.  I'm almost sure I wouldn't want to live with somebody.  I like sleeping alone.  Sure I like to cuddle, kiss, spoon but waking up in the middle of the night with an arm over my face is not something I strive for. 

My advice, live the life you have.  Be grateful you have enough to eat, can work, have all your limbs, if you do.  There are a billion people who would gladly trade you lives.  You're on reddit which means you have access to the Internet, a billion people don't.  

That old guy on Grindr messaging 20 year old boys is sad, no doubt but he sure isn't anywhere near the top 100 things I worry about.  And do you know how easy it is to say, ""not interested""?

98,"Wow I‚Äôm so sorry to read this because you must be swirling in confusion and anxiety. Bottom line, if you really feel that he‚Äôs gay then you‚Äôre going to have to step up to the plate for your own sake. Tell him that this gay question has been a recurring thing for you and you‚Äôre having a hard time completely accepting that he‚Äôs heterosexual. Ask him if perhaps he‚Äôs bisexual as a way to open up a conversation on the topic of his sexuality. I give you props for wanting him to be happy but I‚Äôm clear after reading your post that you want to protect yourself and that‚Äôs the thing you need to focus on here. Don‚Äôt let someone else‚Äôs confusion or personality traits lead you down a path that you want no part of. I wish you the very best of luck."

The friendship should be paramount. Don't risk it over some good head and a misunderstanding.

I've got a ""straight"" buddy that I blow from time to time, we're both 38 (so slightly older. Lol), and sometimes he just ""likes a dude to suck his dick"" to quote him.

You may find you like it and sexuality is a spectrum. Maybe it's not for you or maybe it turns into a somewhat regular thing.

I mean, a mouth is a mouth when the lights go out.üòâ

Just enjoy your youth. Don't buy into society's bullshit labels."

122,"I had a feeling people might get hung up on that part. 

It wasn‚Äôt sensual. In that moment, it was a way for him to show his affection while communicating to me that he doesn‚Äôt give a fuck that I‚Äôm gay. It was like a: ‚Äúyou have insecurities about being my friend given your sexuality, so I‚Äôm going to show you that I‚Äôm willing to do something intimate with you to prove that it doesn‚Äôt bother me.‚Äù"

Your boyfriend is actually a mannequin. You‚Äôve been tricked"
125,"Well you're already a great dad for coming here and seeking advice. Your son is a lucky guy! As hard as it might be, try not to take it personally. I knew my mum would be totally fine with me being gay, and yet for some reason coming out to her still terrified me for years. I was scared of disappointing her in some way, and even when someone is totally supportive of LGBT rights, they can often see things differently when its their own child. So I guess what I'm trying to say is, even when a parent has done everything right, your kid can still be scared to come out to you, but its not because of you in any way.

He'll come out to you when he's ready, in the mean time I would say just show an interest in all areas of his life. Dont get too hung up on wanting him to tell you this one thing, I'm sure there are plenty of other things he'd like to talk to you about and have you involved in. He's still really young, so just make yourself approachable, maybe drop little hints, and above all, just treat him the exact same way you do with your other kids. "

138,"My first lover and I had been together for a number of years, and his parents had completely accepted us.  They referred to me as their other son.  He got of the military while I continued on for a career.  During a transition he went and stayed at his parents until I could make arrangements at the next duty assignment.  I came to visit.

Well, Saturday morning came around, and we woke up, and were in a very playful mood.  In a completely jocular manner I threw him on his stomach, and mounted him, and was bouncing high up and down in a mock humping.  We both still had our sweat pants on under the sheet, but he went mock super effeminate.  Squealing, and saying stuff like, ""hurt me Daddy"", etc.  It was all just meant to be giggly and playful wrestling.

Well, I looked over my shoulder, and saw the bedroom door quietly closing, and this appalled look on his mother's face.  I knew in that instant that she would have forever burned into her mind the image of her son being a totally affected and super effeminate and submissive gay boi.  Which couldn't have been further from the truth.  He was a martial arts champion, and a first rate athlete, and didn't back up from anything in the world.

There was no possibility of discussing it.  Not from the culture his mother had come from.

139,"And that's why I'll never come out, ladies and gentlemen. My family will probably stone me to death."

143,This would be a good way to approach it with the in-laws rather than pre-outting him. If they‚Äôre against it they might end up changing how they treat him.
144,"""Why are attractive men so attractive?"""
145,"Being a gay man can be highly isolating even if you're in an area where there is an active scene ect. I think it's because the nature by which we meet other gay men has become utterly contrived and shallow, (grendr ect.) combined with the fact that mental health impacts gay men more than our hetero equivalents often being both a cause and a symptom of our loneliness.

Many gay men also often have body image issues for example, because of our exposure to porn, dating apps and lgbt media which seems to think you're only valid if you're beautiful (and usually white), even the good movies seem to be dominated by beautiful men.... anyway i digress... i think this also impacts the way we see each-other, dismissing guys through the aforementioned contrived media because they don't look like porn stars / the expected ideal someone has formed in their head, or developing anxiety which makes it difficult to meet others. 

There's other issues such as internalised shame which means engaging in a meaningful way with someone of the same gender is avoided because it requires confronting your sexuality front on.

And i'm still working it out, why we all seem to be lonely all at the same time seems strange to me. I feel like i'm a catch personally and yet i can't seem to get a date despite being in a city with a large lgbt community. I don't get it...

149,"There was this 70's movie called Logan's Run. It was set in the future and one of the things they had was something called the circuit. It was like a combo of Grindr and the transporter from Star Trek. You browsed holographic images of the people 'on circuit' and when you saw what you liked you pushed a button and they 'beamed' right into your living room. Appeared to be solely for having sex, or at least that was my perverted take on it.


Grindr won't exist when you're old. You'll be that old gay guy on something like that. "

160,"It's an old cliche but it's the fucking truth: It gets better.  Please keep that in mind.  You're young and you have your whole life ahead of you.

I don't like it when people act like you should just blow off your parents in these situations because they're your parents and you love them.  It's going to be hard, but at the end if the day, your father has made his decision.  I wouldn't give up on him but you're an adult and you can't waste your life because he's willfully ignorant.

Just take things one day at a time and I promise you *it will absolutely 100% get better*."
161,Let me know if you get to the bottom of this
162,"It seems like you're ok with him having sex in your place as long as they're respectful of the fact that other people are living there and that he's doing so in a healthy way, not only for him physically, but also for his emotional wellbeing.

I don't think you can realistically tell him not to have sex... he will just find other ways, be they outside the home or under your nose.

So, in terms of him being respectful of you, he just needs to be more discreet about it, and so that's you setting your boundaries. Seems pretty straightforward. 

In terms of his emotional wellbeing, if he's exploring with someone close to his age who's in the same boat as he is generally, then they could possibly benefit from that and support one another. 

The main elements of ""the talk"" should result in him understanding how to set his own boundaries during sex, be they for his safety AND his own mental health. This is extremely important so he learns to engage in sex on his own terms and not be manipulated or feel pressured by anyone. He needs to know he has an equal voice in any sexual interaction and should be vocal about what he will do and won't do.

In terms of his physical safety, obviously if there's anal intercourse happening, a condom is necessary. The lining of the rectum is highly absorbent and *will* bleed a bit during sex. This is totally normal, but also means that it is an easy gateway to his bloodstream, which is why it's so easy to get HIV through unprotected sex as a bottom. But, there are a host of other STIs that can transmit too, as I'm sure you know.  Intercourse is not always on the menu sexually for gay people... unlike straight people who typically culminate in intercourse. HIV does not easily transmit during oral, saliva kills the virus. So, no one I've ever crossed paths with uses condoms for oral. But, he needs to have a healthy mouth too. No open wounds or sores, and best not to engage in oral right after flossing or anything. 

These are the basics. The rest of the safe sex mantra is the same for straight people. He needs to be up on all the STIs that are out there so he knows the risks with sex. Understanding how they transmit and how they are treated results in better decisions in bed, and less panic afterwards if he thinks something went wrong. Make sure he knows he can come to you with any issues or questions on this front. 

The most important thing is for him to understand what sex is and isn't. It is an expression of two (or more, let's face it) people's love or lust for one another. It is great when there are emotions in place, but is also fine as an act in and of itself. Be sex positive with him and do not place judgments on sex itself. This is what comes to the top of my head as I quickly jot these thoughts here, but if you have questions, let me know."
163,I enjoyed the laughter without the slightest bit of guilt.  
164,"My opinion? I wish to everything that he could actually become a serious contender. I would love to live in a nation that elected that man president. I mean. Putting aside the fact that he‚Äôs openly gay, happily married and a walking example of positive Christianity, he‚Äôs a Rhodes scholar who went to Harvard, a war veteran who did a tour in Afghanistan  while mayor. Plus he has accomplished something impressive for his city. "

173,"Yeah same here. And I dress masculine and try not to look gay. But yet they can always tell lol. I used to hate it, but now I embrace it. "
174,"Because they view gay men as perverts anyway, so in their mind the line between having sex with another man and preying on a young boy is blurred to non- existent. Plus they fear that exposure to gay men will turn boys gay. Because that‚Äôs totally how it works."

Hold out for the Quality Person that you deserve."
192,"Many commenters are saying it's rude, or even recommending saying things like ""fuck off"". Please don't. That's a silly, combative way to interact with people who probably mean no harm. Unless you're absolutely sure the person is trying to hurt you, use the opportunity to educate them, in a friendly way. Remember, straight people usually know about gays from the media, and the media focuses on a very certain type of gay. When someone says this, they're merely expressing surprise, since their knowledge about the topic is skewed, *through no fault of their own*. So instead of attacking someone just for a lack of knowledge, kindly give them that knowledge.

Just say something like - hi, actually most gays don't follow those well-known stereotypes you see on TV. This is why, for most gays, unless you know the person well, you'll probably never guess they're gay. Being gay is just part of who I am, and though for some people that orientation is tied with certain behaviors and mannerisms, that's not the case for me, or for most gays."
193,"Wow... A whole lot going on there! Sooooo many red flags. 

I never have sex with friends (I'm friendly with my hookups but they aren't friends). It's also why I don't hook up with attached guys because they hold you at arms length and don't want to get close to you. I understand why but I'm not into impersonal mechanical sex. Gets boring fast. 

Just like it's recommended not to get into business with family or friends, similarly id suggest not getting intimate with friends. 

Past behavior is a clear indicator of future behavior. If you keep them in your circle, there'll just be more of the same. Is that acceptable to you? 

I'd get rid of both, the ex and friend, off. Your ex for fucking your friend and your friend for allowing it to happen. Your friend is no friend for letting that happen. 

Let you friend have the pleasure of telling your ex he does not want him for a relationship.

214,"Depends on the situation honestly. 

* If I'm meeting someone in a place that isn't a gay public space I'll give them solid eye contact that shows them I'm interested. It's not something I can really explain it's just kind of a confident look you give someone to let them know you're into them. If they come up to you/you come up to them after that and conversation seem right I'll just be forward.
* If I'm with friends and I like someone I might have a friend wingman and get information on him or casually drop something like ""didn't your ex bf also work/live/come from/etc there?"" It actually works pretty well. 
* If I'm in a gay place I'll be fairly forward because it's already assumed. 

There's a handful of times my gaydar is just completely off but it's very uncommon for a straight guy to have a bad reaction if you're not a forceful jerk about it. Also helps that I'm what most would consider a muscle bear/wolf so I don't get into many confrontations. "

220,"This. Truvada has been used to treat HIV for at least half a decade before it created and started the PReP program. In fact, PrEp is still widely an unknown thing for most of straight people. 

Unless your boss is close with an informed gay friend or relative, chances are he might not know the difference or even the existence of PreP and might be thinking you are positive. 

Disclosing status to him in this case could be more educative than anything else. And quite honestly, you got nothing to lose. Quite the opposite, leaving that unsaid might lead to assumptions on both if you that could lead to some misunderstandings in the future. These things are very delicate and is super important to leave no blurry lines as hard and awkward it might be to settle them. "

239,"It‚Äôs the closest we‚Äôve got to guns- screw somebody up without having to stab them. 
On Grindr, acid threats by rejected old men are relatively common. 
"
240,"you are not in the closet, they are severly in denial.  They already know"
241,I really did. He was so accepting. Now I feel stupid for not doing this earlier
242,"Tell them you want to meet up first in a public spot for coffee etc.  Some will bail because they just want a quick fuck, but someone will be willing to take the time to become comfortable. 

Also check out Tinder, Scruff, A4A, even DaddyHunt if you‚Äôd like an older guy to take his time and show you the ropes..."
243,"That guy is no friend of yours! My senior year I finally had the balls to cut one of the most toxic people in my life because she told me I was just confused and we couldn‚Äôt be friends anymore until I found Jesus. True friends would stand by you and support you from the get-go PERIOD. 

"
244,Getting it put in me üòè
245,too real bro :((
246,"Behold:

*Darwin turns in grave*"
247,"Finally.  I find it mind-boggling that so many guys respond to this apathetically or dismiss it.  I don't think people realize how many of the profiles are run through bot farms.  They're not all just some undesirable creep catfishing you, though there's still plenty of that going on.  They're collecting information, our information, from a platform where most of us have sexually charged dialogues and exchange personal photographs in a way that we would never do in other settings.  And just because a person is of no value for targeting today they could be down the road, and that data is always going to be out there.  I'm not an alarmist, I don't think the following is likely to happen at all but it is theoretically possible that society's attitudes towards homosexuals could change again and in a short period of time. It's happened before. So any country or entity gathering our information we could potentially be used against us at some point it's something that should be very concerning to all of us. "
248,"This. There's less and less of one. Pretty lgbt bars are whats being talked about. I run into non-straight people everywhere. I meet them at volleyball, work, gym, etc. There's little groups like gaymer meetups and hikes but as far as ""scene,"" most people are just referring to clubs and bars."
249,"Congratulations! :)

This has obviously been a highlight of your Life--I'm so glad it happened to you!

(I am, however, ""confused"" by that (sensuous?) ""kiss on the neck""...)"
250,"""his hygiene is impeccable""

He gay.

"
251,"The throbbing when he cums, it almost surpasses my love to see that rod spit some cock snot"
252,"Well I‚Äôm chubby, ugly dick, and already balding heavily at 27 so my career is over before it began. "
253,"You handled this situation wrong. You should have called out that nasty bitch who snitched after intentionally provoking a response from you. You were not in the wrong at any point of this story, you have nothing to apologize for and next time you find yourself in a situation like this stand your ground no matter what and don‚Äôt give them the satisfaction of reducing you to a meek and apologetic state. That was exactly what she wanted and she got it. I would stay away from supported groups to begin with honestly, they seem to always turn into a competition of attention seekers trying to prove why their struggles are the most important. "
254,Ugh remember when Roseanne Barr had redeeming qualities?
255,"I have been lusting over him since his Baywatch days...

Maybe unpopular opinion, but he's stunning to look at. "
256,"Have neighbors noticed an increase in traffic of guys coming to your home?  Are you worried about this or are you in a rural area?  Have guys stopped by without an appointment, like in the middle of the night?"
257,Yup. 
258,reading this made my chest warm! i‚Äôm so happy for you and your amazing friendship. it‚Äôs so rare for straight men to be incredibly vulnerable like that. best wishes to both of you. 
259,üê∂ That's sad üêï
260,When he's ready he'll tell you. Please wait till he's ready. Don't force it.
261,The Reveal üçÜ
262,"No, you did the right thing. He was drunk, so it wouldn‚Äôt have been right, and it could have potentially ruined your relationship with him. Next time you hang out, and before the alcohol starts flowing, try to talk to him about it. Ask if he remembers the conversation at all, and if he really does feel that way. If he does, then you can help him fully understand what he‚Äôs been feeling. And if he asks you again when he‚Äôs not drunk to jerk off together, then go for it. "
263,"You are a gay sports fan's dream. Just not in the last 2:00 of the game, please."
264,I love cuddling! Not to mention that it builds trust!
265,"Ouch, my heart"
266,Stop discouraging us so you can have him for yourself. 
267,Mmmmm what?
