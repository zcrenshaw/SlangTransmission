0,Upvote because you put yourself out there and went for something you wanted 
1,There's a saying (obviously joking) in my country that a man must act gay otherwise the gayness will accumulate and turn the man gay for real. 
2,OK your mission is to go and find that black haired boy and fall in love with him and marry him. It will make the most romantic story ever. 
3,Ask for refugee status in Canada. This doesn't look good and you must look after yourself and closed ones.
4,I‚Äôd say financial stability is the most comfortable feeling in the world.
5,I so need a Grindr mechanic in my life.
6,"Follow up and ask them for feedback on why you were not chosen to help with future interviews. Be kind and gracious. 

Sometimes it can be something you didn‚Äôt notice. "
7,Wow. This is insane. Stay safe. 
8,Sorry dude
9,"&gt;AIDS clinics have also been shut down under Magafuli, accused of ""promoting"" homosexuality, while he has encouraged women to abandon birth control and have more babies.

10,"Not nearly as bad but I do have a story: The Canadian province my mom lives in recently had some debate about a potential law that would force schools to tell parents if their kids were part of a GSA. She decided to voice her opinion on the matter in the comments of a post made by the provincial government party on Facebook. She said when I was 16 i was coerced into joining a gsa under false pretenses where I was then brainwashed into believing I was bisexual which caused me to have an identity crisis leading to depression and suicidal thoughts, and if only the school would have told her would she have been able to ""help"" me sooner. She also added that I am no longer bisexual. I am still very much bisexual. "
11,"Few of my straight male friends say the same kinda shit too, they also seem pretty obsessed with dicks... ü§®ü§®"
12,"I got an email when I asked; they were afraid I didn't have the time commitment because I'm a part time bank teller and part time student.  I wish I had asked my interviewers if they had any concerns with me as a candidate!!  Or I wish that they asked my to go over my schedule with them :(.  

I compared my school schedule and even talked to my branch manager, who said she'd be happy to accommodate for me to pursue the volunteership!

14,That's how it happened for me.
15,oh my god this is adorable it‚Äôs like a fairytale to a single gay omg
16,"You need to be happy with yourself first.  It sounds like you are. 

You dated yourself.  Usually I date myself with corny 80's humor. Coffee doesn't sound too bad, either. "
17,Thanks you :).  
18,"When a gay guy does it, people don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre joking or legit trying to hit on/harass them."
19,"It's hard in situations like the one you describe to know whether to be disgusted by the intolerance and bigotry or saddened and embarrassed by the stupidity.  Presumably, these gruesome parents actually believe that what they are doing to their child is done out of some kind of 'love'?  "
20,I wonder how long it will take for the whole world to become a civilized place.
21,You're implying I even get dates.
22,"That's a man thing, in general. Freud went there."
23,"It sounds like they had a valid reason for not hiring you, but it is still unfortunate that you didn‚Äôt get the job that you wanted."
24,If you're in the greater NYC area I can be that guy lol
25,"Yeah, I've been thinking the last 2 days, I wonder if he grew up to be gay. Don't know where I would even begin to search for him. He was English I believe. Same age as me, black hair and stayed at the hotel Barbecan Sol in Playa Del Ingles in 2000/2001"
26,In high school while I was in the closet the guys would slap each other on the ass and pin each other against the lockers shirtless or in their underwear. I meanwhile I couldn't act gay cause I had to play Hide the Boner.
27,"He sucks, but you suck too on this occasion. Saying you have to finish your game and doing so after a guest arrives is rude."
28,"That's how I met my husband. I just walked up to him and wouldn't leave him alone. haha

29,"Gone through something fairly similar but with my Muslim parents.

&amp;#x200B;

People read in a lot of their own biases into their holy scriptures which when looked at in the original language DO NOT support their views.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, in the Qur'an, God acknowledges that he has created males, females, and those in between and those who will migrate in between in a specific passage. In many English translations this is rendered as ""males, females and all creation"" because earlier translators weren't very queer-friendly. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a person who identifies as non-binary, that has given me a lot of solace."
30,"It's a combination of being so secure in themselves they don't need to worry about getting shit over it and playful banter and 1upsmanship.

Personally I think getting upset and treating it like a personal insult is an overreaction - it's not meanspirited and you are a third party. How two other people engage and show their friendship with each other isn't really something your opinion should have weight on."
31,I'm a gaybro from Portugal and I'm following the polls so I wish you the best of luck! Boa sorte! ü§û
32,"Interesting. Personally, I signed a contract to be a fabulous bitch, but I didn't read the fine print."
33,I can repair your uber
34,"This. OP, pack up and to the embassy ASAP."
35,I‚Äôm a huge cuddle advocate so that‚Äôs gonna be a yas from me dawg
36,I think OP is way off with his example for Bolsonaro‚Äôs anti-gay stance; this man said he‚Äôd rather have a dead son than a gay one. Not to mention he‚Äôs been very vocal about being a proud homophobe. I feel like suggesting that being gay as a result of too little spanking is about the least chilling thing he‚Äôs said regarding the LGBT community.
37,Wear a shirt that says ‚ÄúFree Hugs‚Äù and with a sharpie write ‚Äúand bjs‚Äù in tiny print.
38,amen üôè
39,"Meh, religion is the same as politics - the true believers will never be convinced by facts."
40,"I think you answered your own question. A lot of gay men are broken people that spent much of their youth being rejected. 

We often don‚Äôt have people in our lives whom we can model our romantic relationships after.

It‚Äôs understandable to a degree, though exhausting if you‚Äôre in the thick of it. 

On top of that, the 21st century has given us all sorts of new ways to distract ourselves from engaging in intimate connections (for both straights and gays and platonic and romantic relationships alike). 

I do well in the looks department, have my shit together, am mildly successful, and live in a nice-sized city. I experience most of what you wrote quite often. I‚Äôve talked to my therapist about it, she tells me I will make a great partner and if/when I do get married, I very likely won‚Äôt get divorced or cheat on my partner because of my personality and values.

And yet, dating is still extremely difficult for me. I loathe getting on the apps, it‚Äôs a lot of empty non-sense. Occasional dates that don‚Äôt go anywhere. The ones that are interested are interested for the wrong reasons or are too clingy.  The ones I‚Äôm interested in seem to return my affections briefly and then one day they disappear (sidenote: I hate when you don‚Äôt know the last time you‚Äôre hanging out with someone will be the last time you ever see them).

I just try to focus on me and my friends. That‚Äôs all I can do to maintain my sanity. The way others treat me is a reflection of themselves and their own turmoil. 

Maybe I‚Äôll find a guy one day, maybe I won‚Äôt. Just gotta keep marching forward. You can‚Äôt fix an entire broken generation. "
41,"You're allowed to grieve. Its completely normal to feel the way you do. I don't know what it's like to break up with someone, but i do know what it's like to have deep bouts of depression. I think what makes it easier for emotional healing is acceptance and acknowledgement of the situation. "
42,"You are an amazing person honestly,.. going out of your way to help others! Is so next level kindness! "
43,I think you probably had a better time with just yourself if the guy can‚Äôt be bothered to just send a message to you he ain‚Äôt worth your time. Congrats on turning 30 
44,"sounds like you need better tops

^^^like ^^^me"
45,"If it's any consolation, I was traveling yesterday and hopped on Grindr. Ended up going to this guy's room in the same hotel and we chatted, watched some Netflix, cuddled, and fell asleep together.  It was intimate without being sexual, so it's definitely possible üòä"
46,"Ok but a concept: you‚Äôre rich, lying in a very spacious bed, the sweetest, great looking guy is in your arms. "
47,That's craziness 
48,"No, dude, that's fucked up. Confront him about it, because that's massively disrespectful to you. "
49,"You should begin research on how to seek asylum in another country. Denmark for instance has a 90% acceptance rate for first time applicants. They also have a free education system. At 19 (regardless of if you are currently financially dependent on your parents) you are considered an adult in many of the countries in which you can seek asylum. 

I can see how moving to a foreign country and starting over alone with little to nothing could seem scary but it would be much worse if you were to get outed. Please stay safe. Start a go fund me if you need to and get donations to leave asap. "

I deleted all my dating apps too because I felt the same. I feel so much better without them! More focused on life and less about sex and superficial things every second of the day.

I wish you the best and don‚Äôt focus on finding love.. let it find you. "
53,"See I tried that, and I got a restraining order...."
54,"Uhhh you guys might want to take a look at u/Ismsogaydude post history and comment history.

This guy is literally a jerk to anyone who disagrees with him, as well as being a jerk in general and trying to fuck up someone's relationship because they have feelings for the dude in the relationship.

E.g this comment 'Ugh... keep your Bible quotes and stick them up your rectum! This is all nonsense!  If you need to argue this silliness and quote this archaic, bronze-aged mythology do it somewhere else. '

57,"You're gay. Imagine living with a woman for nearly two decades.

I get you're mad for what he did to your mom. But 20 years ago, things were different for people like us. We had to hide and pretend. Things are fucked up on all sides of this. Your mom lost her husband. Your dad wants to be his authentic self. Your dad's bf realizes he's something of catalyst for this change in your life, but he's trying to make peace with you.

Your mom is kind of right by sending you with your dad. Being vicious to each other isn't going to help anything.

Talk to your dad. Tell him about what you're feeling and how frustrating this all is. You both might be able to ease things up a bit."

What your friend is going to have to realize is what a lot of gay people have realized - that A) they may come around or they may not. Age does do things to people's 'standards'. 

B) If they do not come around, the sweetest kind of family is the one you create. The ones that look to see you coming and leave a light on. 

C) That this is one type of religion and does not speak for all of them (not even close). 

D) That it's not important who you love, which is the irony here, but *That*  you love. That you're capable of it. Anything else is sociopathy and never associate with anyone like that. Ever. "
77,This is really nice. Twice in the  last month the only guys that approached me are the ones wanting to talk about the lord and saviour Jesus Christ and how to convert me. I guess it‚Äôs something

This isn't case of dissing gamers; you were being a shitty host from the get-go. If you don't see the insult in how you acted, you need to learn how to.

113,"My husband is a child advocate (basically exactly what you described) and it does take up a lot of time if you're doing the job as you are supposed to be. The problem is that a lot of people don't do what they're supposed to and the kids get screwed over royally, primarily because in most cases, the child advocate is the only consistent presence in their lives. They can hop from foster home to foster home. They can change attorneys, judges, therapists multiple times. But their child advocate is generally a mainstay that doesn't change and that's very important for stability and to ensure that a big picture of the child's experience is able to be consistently relayed to the judges making crucial decisions about their lives. Recently my husband worked a case where he spent two full days working on a certain aspect of the case that, while extremely important, was not being addressed by anyone, and being specifically ignored by another organization that was supposed to have handled it months ago and had simply lied about it. If there hadn't been someone who was part of the case months ago who was also part of the case today who also had a few days to just drop everything and work on this, some really messed up stuff might have happened to this kid.... I say all of this to say that there are really good reasons why they are such sticklers about available time when it comes to selecting child advocates. They may have made the wrong decision with you, but they did what they felt would be in the best interests of the children. I would follow up and instead of trying to convince them that you do, in fact, have the time, ask them if there are other ways in which you can help. Once you've proven yourself available through helping out in other ways, perhaps they'll reconsider. "

120,"You are granted refugee status without explaination to the state you are seeking refuge from. The problem becomes potentially having to fight deportation at which point you must show cause and would have to out yourself. 

OP would be better off booking a flight to Canada where he can claim status on arrival. Which means Canada can't deny him status until his case is heard. Of course he'll be detained but the process can take years and in the meantime he'll be safe. 

He could also do the same at any EU nation but should be careful which nation he lands in first as that is the nation responsible for him, not a preferred destination location. I hear Germany is quite good for accepting refugee status for lgbtq people and an English speaker can learn German relatively easily.  Also Frankfurt is a large enough airport that you can easily get a flight to the from almost anywhere in Africa. "

Of course, the idea that being gay is a choice is pretty silly. As a friend of mine once said, many years ago when we were in our late teens: ""Do you actually think I would willingly choose something that would isolate and alienate myself more than necessary?!?!"" (we lived in the South). We all know some folks do stupid shit to piss off their parents, or show ""society"" something or other (as if anyone gives a shit), only to later chill out and come back to earth. I think a lot of the religious folks are super confused - to them, somehow, being gay is 100% a choice, and the only reason you would make that choice is to ""get back at"" or rebel against someone (maybe God). I suppose, if you can catch them in a rational mood, you could ask ""do you think you could just turn off being heterosexual and switch over to homosexuality, like a lightswitch?"" or ""Do you wake up in the morning and think 'hmm... am I gay or not gay today?'"""

She has a law degree and is a decade older than you. She left home at 16 and raised a child by herself. She's tough but this job regularly brings her to tears. Especially when the system fails the child.  


She needs every piece of life experience especially when she needs to go up against a racist cop, government bureaucrats or a nasty school. The abusive parents are a handful too.   


The reports you mentioned, they can end up in court. If you deem a home ok and suddenly that kid dies, how are you going to react? This position is more than just a child's life, it's the parents and grandparents who are impacted.  


It's beautiful that you want to help, and the agency probably loved you, but I'm guessing there is a reason why they can't fill these positions is because of the life experience required."

I think one day you're going to regret what you're doing right now. Anger is consuming your mind, but just imagine how much social pressure he had to have been under to marry a woman in the first place.

It's NOT wrong to be uncomfortable about it because that's what everyone around us tells us that gayness is a big no-no.

Just try to not shove it to the back of your mind. Try to read, talk, search and think more about it. This discomfort comes from the unfamiliarity of the situation. Once you believe that there's nothing wrong with you, it's only uphill from there.

Woke up to find my husband wasn't in bed so I went downstairs to find him curled up on the floor with Jester in his lap and they were both passed out. Grabbed a blanket and layed down with him.

You can suggest a counselor, although, I think he will decline. The best thing you can do is be there for him and remind him that it is OK if he is gay. I am sure that by telling one person is helping him a bunch.

I went through a similar experience, but I think I was able to fake it better."

Of course if you want to take additional measures you can:
1. Look into PrEP

I am a firm believer that there should be some things you are willing to burn bridges for. Your brother and his wife have just told you that they believe you're evil. What kind of positive relationship could you possibly have, with people who believe that you're **evil**?

So, confront them. This is clearly an unresolved issue, and until you resolve it (one way or another) there's no way you can have a true, respectful, loving relationship with your brother."

So what I'm doing about it is working really fucking hard to make myself into someone worth being with. You're gonna be lonely and older anyway, why not spend the intervening years setting goals and working towards them?

I'm still lonely and still working towards something, but the hard time I've put in has made me feel like I will fully deserve love if and when it finds me. Sure most people deserve it but that doesn't matter at all if *you* don't feel like you do. Earn it.

In the dating world, if someone wants to limit their options, then it's their choice. And demanding they go out with people who they are not attracted to seems like it would be a step backward.  "

I honestly don't know how this is going to turn out. I can't make a prediction about that. What I can say is that his actions are reckless and immature. He wants to have his cake and eat it too. He wants to try his freedom while he well knows you are still on the hook. That is really not fair to you. Not fair at all. In a way, it shows you where you stand.

That said, it is crystal clear to me that you love him... and people love others with faults all the time. This isn't the worst thing I have heard someone do in a relationship. Sometimes, they still manage to patch back up the relationship after the harm was done.

However, if you get back together with him, I strongly suggest you take some actions to protect you... build up a little wall around your heart because if he can do this... well... there is no guarantee about the future.

Look, you seem like a really good guy and I understand why you want to see this out. You are not going to find negative judgment about that from me. So, I wish you the best. You don't deserve what happened to you... and I hope things turn out the way you want them to.

I haven't used grindr in a long time but I remember once getting a message from an older gentlemen (40's) asking if I was interested in getting coffee. I simply said no thank you, but good luck and he said that was the nicest response he ever got. That's unfortunate.

221,You did the right thing and you don't need anyone but yourself to be happy.
222,"Exactly. 44 and I haven‚Äôt met anyone since ‚Äò96. If you‚Äôre gay you have to stop looking at how your straight friends meet. We make up 95% fewer people. Our choices are virtually nothing. Most guys have expectations and standards that I can guarantee will leave you single until you die. Most of us will grow old and die alone. Relationships between gay men have not and for whatever reason for the most part don‚Äôt seem to last. We date like 7th graders. We are largely stuck in the point in adolescence when we discovered we were gay and our emotional growth ended there. This has turned us into selfish gay adults who want money, expensive condos/cars/things; living in the biggest and most expensive cities and that‚Äôs created a lot of ‚Äòrich bitch‚Äô attitude that turns us against each other. It‚Äôs also created a ‚Äòyou‚Äôre not good enough‚Äô unless you have money, are under 30 and have a doctorate degree. God help all the gay men who quit high school and never had the courage to go back and work minimum wage. We don‚Äôt stick up for the men hurting the most in our community like other minority communities- and I‚Äôm guessing many of those men have already ended the their lives without saying anything. 
The way I hear straight women gush about how great gay men are as friends - why can‚Äôt we be that for each other? "

That's a real dick move, especially if the other person is too shy to just leave if they don't want to watch you play video games. Like, have some decency. "
253,"Listen, not only yes, but difficult to control dosage yes. 

You see the membranes and tissues in the anal areas are extremely close to and involved with the flow of blood to and from the vital centers of your body. So any application of drugs to the area usually results in extremely quick and complete absorption of the drug or substance and DUMPING it directly into the blood stream. 

So using a large dose or a highly toxic substance would result in rapid absorption with potentially uncontrolled results. 

Comparing this to (for example) SMOKING where you have a metered dose and can stop smoking when you reach a certain level of use, or EATING where you ingest a dose and it is slowly processed and then absorbed over time into the body is VERY DIFFERENT. 

Keep this in mind when considering this sort of experimentation. This is why they find that some people who create enemas with alcohol beverages then become uncontrollably affected and can reach a toxic level of exposure to the drug or chemical extremely quickly. It has resulted in someone using drugs or alcohol in this manner to fall into a coma while in a bathtub resulting in their drowning death. 

So....if you are going to use this way, it is important to place appropriate safeguards into play. Use in a group, have a plan for if someone becomes injured, and do not underestimate the strength of doses, chemicals, and the potency of anal delivery of drugs. "
