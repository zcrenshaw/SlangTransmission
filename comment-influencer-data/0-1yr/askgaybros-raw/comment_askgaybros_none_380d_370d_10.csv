1,"Yes, though it's still being studied.

Men and women have different speech patterns. This is due not just to men having physically lower-pitched voices than women, but also due to social factors - essentially, accents or dialects. There is, to greatly simplify, a ""male accent"" and a ""female accent"" (or rather, there are *many* male accents and *many* female accents depending on region, subculture, etc.)

One source - but probably not the only source - of the ""gay voice"" is essentially the ""male accent"" overlaid or mixed with some ""female"" features. Men (at least in Anglophone or Western culture) typically use less variation in intonation, i.e. are more monotone, while women are more expressive in their intonation. One aspect of ""gay voice"" is a greater degree of variation in intonation than the typical male accent. Or, note the ""gay lisp"": Firstly, that it's not an actual lisp (nobody's replacing the ""s"" sound with the ""th"" sound) - it's just a phonetically different pronunciation of the ""s"" sound, the details of which I won't go into. But listen carefully sometime to women you know and women in the media and pop culture. You may notice that some women have an ""s"" sound that sounds kind of like the ""lispy"" s that some gay men have. It's just much less noticeable with women since we expect women to speak in a different way than men. It stands out more when you hear it on a man.

One possible explanation for why some gay men have this ""female-shifted"" accent is that many gay men, during the formative pre-teen and early teen years (or earlier), spend more time with female relatives and female friends than their male peers, due to discomfort with normative masculinity and the budding heterosexuality of their male peers. I'm sure that many users here stuck with female friends at this age. And of course, accents are spread around within social groups, so even gay men who didn't have this experience growing up can pick up these dialectal features from other gay men in adulthood.

And of course, there may be and probably are factors beyond that. Some aspects of ""gay voice"" may have originated entirely among gay men without the influence of female speech patterns. It's a fact that in many societies around the world, gay men, and queer/LGBT minorities in general, have their own special dialect or code that they use as a sign of group membership and to protect themselves from outsiders. Gay men in the United Kingdom once had a sort of code like this, almost amounting to a separate dialect, called Polari, and some words from Polari survive in modern-day English-language gay slang. Notably, the term ""zhush"" comes from Polari.

2,"Here is what you say: “I don’t know exactly what’s going on with you but I want you to know that it is 100% ok with me if you are into guys because I love you and want you to be happy, no matter what.”"
3,"Your boyfriend has already indicated that if you’re not going, then he’s not. He’s willing to take this action towards your relationship. The problem no longer lies with him, but with his family.

It will also lie with you, but only if you allow it to."
4,"Just as a reminder: when your hookup catfishes you and they show up and aren’t who they said they were, be strong and tell them you aren’t into it. When their dick smells/tastes bad, tell them you are done and they should leave. If you go to their place, you can always turn around and leave.

Before you agree to hookup, consider if they are super weird in person, can you protect yourself, and if not, maybe don’t hookup or have a plan to stay safe (tell a friend to check in soon, etc).

Don’t put yourself into a position you can’t get out of, and if someone takes advantage of you then fuck them back by calling the cops. It’s not your fault that people are lying assholes, protect yourself just in case and if something goes wrong, stand up for yourself afterwards when it’s safe."
5,"They both suck, but I’d rather be an openly gay man in Rome than anywhere in the Middle East."
6,Oh and DO NOT openly compare him to his brother! 
7,"1. Learn how to hold a conversation. Some of y'all...i have no idea how you function day to day not having any skills at all. 
2. Don't take the apps too seriously
3. Exercise and keep moving and get in the habit of doing this while young. trust me, after 30 it's a bit more painful to get started doing this
4. Have interests, hobbies, et cetera. Even if you're not a social butterfly (I sure as fuck am not!) it's still important to have these things....and only you will know what interests you.
5. Always tell the truth. Every single time. Especially to yourself. 
6. Learn when to and when not to give a fuck. A lot of things are really not that important in the grand scheme of things. 
7. Always vote. Don't care who you vote for, just fucking do it.
8. Have fun but don't be stupid about it

10,"Why would you not post a link to the actual article?

https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/4/4/17177058/grindr-gay-men-mental-health-psychiatrist"
11,"I just wanna jack off and then cuddle. Blowjobs are alright, I only like giving, and anal is too much work. Let’s just cuddle!!!"
12,"I have been married for 6 years now and my husband brought a lot of drama into the relationship that we had to sort and deal with. But communication is key here and luckily we were, for the most part, good at talking and then following through with. 

1. The cheating. It does not matter if he thinks it’s not cheating, you think that it is. So this has to be addressed and I mean right now. If you do not know Gino then he needs to be gone. Even if you know Gino, he still needs to be gone. You need to communicate, he needs to understand and the end result is you watching him blocking and then deleting the contact out of his phone. 

1.A - Trust from the cheating. For there to be any trust here your husband has to commit to removing Gino. You do not care what Gino is to him, your married. Gino is some random dude he met online, you sleep next to him and exchanged wedding vows... Fuck Gino

2. After Gino is gone I highly recommend figuring out how to actually communicate with each other, because that’s obviously a problem. Perhaps consider a counselor. 

2.A from your story it sounds like there are some potentially serious issues. And you might consider a good therapist along with the counselor. A side note here, I had a really serious argument with my husband on the us of a therapist and at end of the day he absolutely refused it, instead we had many talks together. Though I think it would have really helped, at the end of the day, it worked for us and being brutally honest with each other is not a problem, it worked for us, it might not for you. 

3. Drugs, alcohol and family. I might be alone in this thought, but it’s not healthy for a mother/son relationship to get black out drunk together. Black out drunk is serious sign for lack of control. Now we have all been there, but is this regular? Black out drunk and married? Seriously how many red flags do you want me to point out. Personally I would have left his ass on the floor that night, that shit pisses me off.  Alcohol does do one thing really well, it always rips open the problems people have and then puts the truth out front and center. The question is how do you want to address so much going on here?

4. Money. You didn’t do this but I am going to say it. The spouse who makes the most money has a gigantic whack-a-mole bat any time you have an argument. You know and he knows who makes the most money, there is no reason to “threaten” him with finances. Finances are on the same level as food water and shelter. 

4.A The ugly facts of life. If you do split up do not feel guilty about his finances. He had a chance to make it easy, now let him lay in what ever bed he chooses. And yes he obviously chose it. 

5. After sorting through the immediate serious shit. Ok now time for the hard part, internal reflection. Why did your husband even start talking to Gino? Is it because he is a piece of shit? Very well possible. Or did you ignore what he was saying/asking/recommending? Also very possible. You must learn to communicate better, period. Also be honest with him but with yourself. If your truly communicating with each other, your going to hear things you don’t like and they might make you very mad. You can get defensive or you can open up and try to change. 

5.A - Figuring out what your relationship needs. Several people are going to say “consider opening the relationship up.” I personally think this is fucking dumb. Your having issues in your relationship because of another person, so your going to save the relationship by bringing another person into the bedroom? Fuck it, you should call Gino yourself and ask if he wants to have a good old fashioned three some! Sounds terrible right? That’s because it is a terrible idea. But I will add, if it’s something you both want, then go for it. I just think it’s a really bad idea right now, maybe in a year after the trust is built back up. Just because your gay doesn’t mean you have to have an open relationship. 

6. Life goes on. Don’t forget to keep the rest of your life together. It’s easy to slip and let it all go. Maybe you guys salvage this relationship, maybe you don’t. But you still have a job, family, friends, pets and or a million other parts to your life. Either way keep your head up and keep on living, because there is so much that you have that’s worth fighting for. 

7. Stop going to bars. This one is hard for most people, particularly at your age. But this will help both of you. Drink at home and be social at your home or someone else’s home. 

I have said it a lot but it’s all about honesty developed though communication. If you can’t be honest with each other and can’t do that comfortably then you will have an impossible task of trying to save your marriage. Good luck!

"
13,"Maybe to start shaking him uncontrollably until he wakes up and say “Good morning bitch, time to get yo ass up”"
14,"Own it. 

Or if he asks what kinda guys you’re into in front of others again, describe him to a tee so it’s blatantly obvious who you’re talking about...then add “but with a bigger penis”. "
15,"Just touching on something I think is important. You mentioned this guy opened his tinder while on the date with you. Forget the Asians for just a second, and think more closely on the action itself (opening tinder while on a date and worse yet, openly letting you see it).

This is a huge, huge, huge red flag, in the sense, are you actually 'seeing' him, or are you really just friends? If he was 'interested' in you, he wouldnt dare open that right in front of you, and keep his entire attention on *you*."
16,"Dude I hooked up with apparently had a dom fetish he didn’t mention.  He answered his door and I extended my hand shake his, but he remained silent and stoic and pointed all authoritarian-like to his bedroom.  To be honest, he looked ridiculous doing it.  He just wanted head, but he was drunk and couldn’t keep it completely hard, talked shit while I was blowing him, then decided I was lying about my age and started yelling at me (while I’m blowing him).  Long story short, I got up, put my shirt on, and told him to fuck off.  

Note:  I’m not even opposed to Dom/sub play....if I know about it ahead of time.  "
17,Gays meeting and getting together in person and not just on apps? On MY gay subreddit?
18,"Sounds like there may be a lot more stress to your relationship than just the cheating...the stress of his financial situation? is the the hammered drunk a rare thing or more of a nightly thing?  Does your husband and his mom gang up on you a lot?

"
19,"She used it because she knew it would hurt you.

If my mother spoke to me like that I would simply not speak with her until she apologized."
20,"i find it more satisfying than hookups but not more satisfying than dating. i cant enjoy hookups because im always way too nervous so i rather masturbate, lol."
21,This is adorable I hope he does!
22,This is one of the best benefits of being gay in my opinion. Being able to share bathroom products means you are never caught short and save a shit load of money. Not weird at all. 
23,"Met up with a guy who turned out to be a professional make up artist, so the pictures he sent looked nothing like him in real life. I kind of like to chat and get to know the guy first so we did and I realized, ""Oh wow, I really don't want to be here.""

So I used the bathroom real quick and set a timer on my phone, but changed the alarm to a ring tone. Then I took the fake phone call and said it was my roommate having some sort of allergy attack and I had to leave asap.

I could've been honest and said I wasn't feeling it but I hate to disappoint people so I lied my way out of it. Not my proudest moment..."
24,"Been there. Coming out didn't stop my moms comments. It went to just ""Why do have to *advertise* being gay?""

26,"Yellow fever? Not a big deal.

He opens Tinder on a date? He hits on a waiter while on a date? Goodbye!"
27,"I was a high school senior and just started using grindr and this attractive dude hit me up to see him later that night but I was a little afraid so I told him i’ll meet him the next day right after school. I take public trashportation to meet him in his hotel room and I realize I was fucking catfished but being so young &amp; naive, I didn’t call him out on it and just wanted to rearrange some guts so I let it slide. 

He insists we do it on the floor near the hotel room entrance and I comply but after a while, I get tired of it and ask can we do it on the bed and he tells me someone else is in the room with him, suddenly i’m naked &amp; afraid cuz at this point, idk what I got myself into. I get up and walk to the beds anyway and I see this tall lightskin guy sleeping but he looks a lil around my age. The catfish &amp; I start fucking on the bed then I witness him do heroin while fucking &amp; my mind couldn’t process this. I hear the tall lightskin guy get up to use the bathroom then he comes over &amp; taps my shoulder then pulls me away from the catfish &amp; starts FUCKING him!

Im standing there awkwardly and try to make best of this shitty situation so I get in front the catfish &amp; get him to give me head until I finish, once we all finally nutted, I started getting ready to leave and the catfish pulls me to the side and gives me 5 $20 bills and says I shouldn’t fuck for free, I take the money and run to my uber. While riding home, he hits me back up on grindr and tells me he has to meet me again because he gave me counterfeit bills……my first grindr hookup and I’ll never forget it"
28,[deleted]
29,"He could be bi, but it could also be that he tried to force himself to be straight and thought being with a woman would change him. Him being queer would make sense as to why he has always seemed nervous because he felt he had to hide/change who he was. Just try and support him through whatever he's going through. "
30,"It sounds like you care more about your son being healthy and safe more than being gay, which is great. You don't need to confront him on it other than checking on his safety with multiple partners- perhaps... 

Possibilities include he started using drugs, he had a mental breakdown related to anxiety or depression (one possibility goout that could be what someone else suggested- him hiding being gay or trying to suppress it), or it could be a bigger mental health crisis such as a manic episode. Hopefully he has gotten medication as you had thought. Just tell and show him you care first and foremost about his health, and that includes him being happy living the life he wants. "
31,You need a dick savings account. 
32,Fuck em. 
33,"I would side with my boyfriend on this one. But it seems like he already did that.

It's gonna be a confrontation either way, and the fact that your boyfriend took your side in this one speaks volumes about how much he values the relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

It's definitely fairly common in south east asia to have this attitude. And the philippines is even worse because of the rampant christian influence there."
34,No one stole his photos. You know exactly what’s happening. It’s up to you whether or not you want to do anything about it though.
35,"The cheating is terrible, but this:

&gt; They were both picking on me quite a bit, and I had asked them to stop on numerous occasions 

It is a sign of a true asshole to consistently make fun of their partner and humiliate them, especially in front of friends and family.

And then he texts you from the other room? He can't even own up to his actions in person, when you're literally in the house?

What he did is cheating, and his attempts to convince you otherwise show his susceptibility to gas-lighting you or someone else in the future. 

Dump his ass.

&amp;#x200B;"
36,What gets me are the profiles with no face pic saying that they don't respond to profiles without a face pic.
37,"I don't see the problem. You are already sharing bodily fluids,(kissing, etc. ) and the various micro-organisms on your body have exchanged.

That being said, hubby and I have our separate stick deodorant, but have used the others when we've run out or need to travel light."
38,"Went to a guys house, told me he showered. Grabbed his dick to go down on him and pulled back his foreskin: dick cheese. I high tailed it outta there."
39,"My brother is straight and when he pierced his ears in high school my dad said people might think he’s gay.  My brother said, “If they would think that’s something negative and treat me badly for it, I wouldn’t want to know them anyway.” "
40,I want a hug 
41,"Love a bottom playing about with his hole while we fuck - tightening, squeezing, pulsing and so on. Have a fuck buddy that'll just suddenly squeeze my cock mid-thrust as hard as he can, that feels amazing getting myself balls deep! Shame most guys can't keep it up for long though!"
42,"Secularism is what tamed Christianity.  

It is not a Christian belief to allow freedom of religion, ban slavery (right after the second commandment God gives explicit instruction on how to treat slaves, including how to sell your daughter into sexual slavery), allow gay rights etc.

Those are all secularists ideals.  And that is what Islam needs.  "
43,Never assume. Many don't use Grindr.
44,"Telling your boss is tantamount to initiating an HR complaint.   What I suggest you do is make a detailed note with date, time, who was present and who said what.  Be as complete as possible.  Don't exaggerate and don't minimize.   Print and sign/date the note and file it in your file cabinet at work.   Any time this happens again, do the same thing.   If it blows up into real harassment, you will have some credible documentation.   If it dies off, just chalk if off as a lesson in how shitty co-workers can be."
45,Depends on my mood but I'll never say no to making out and cuddling. Got back from a 2 month trip and met up with a buddy and we ended up making out for 4 hours but never took off our pants. 
46,beep boop fuck me in the ass
47,Years of crippling depression makes for a good comedian.
48,My head fell off. What do you think? Is it SIDS?
49,"We’d been casually chatting on and off for a few months. His profile seemed to put an awful lot of emphasis on playing safe and not wanting to just hook up. One day he hit me up and wanted to hook up. It was out of character for him and I’m not one for casual hookups usually but I was in the mood, he was hot, and he only lived about a mile away. So off I went. 

The hookup itself was great. No complaints there except he kept trying to insist that I bareback him and he kept going on weird anti-Prep rants. Afterwards he seemed strange. We hung out for a while after and he started showing me pictures of a house he was going to buy. I said that I would love a house like that and he told me that it could be mine too. 

At one point I complimented a tattoo he had running down his entire side. He thanked me by rubbing his body and saying that it was all mine.  It was the way he said it though. It was very Fatal Attraction-esque. He has some strange mannerisms too. He kept criticizing me but would play it off with “ayyeeee I’m just playing”

When I got home I went to shower and noticed that I was COVERED in hickeys. I was all black and blue. I sent him a picture of them captioned “thanks lol”. He denied doing it and got angry. He started asking me who did that. Like in the two minutes it took me to get home I stopped somewhere else for a quickie and got mauled in the process?

For the next few days he would constantly text me asking every detail about my day. He would ask what I was doing, what I’d eaten that day, etc... he was acting like we were boyfriends or something. When I’m at work I keep my phone on silent and don’t always respond right away and this seemed to bother him. 

Finally I went two days without a text from him. On the third day he sent me a lengthy text saying that I disappointed him and how I’m just another trashy gay who only wants to hook up. Keep in mind that he was the one who initiated the hookup in the first place. I told him that he was coming off way too strong and then apologized if I gave him the wrong impression. Then he asked how my day was. I blocked him. 

About a year later he made a new account and hit me up. He seemed like he didn’t even remember me. "
50,"To add a touch of delicate, since the older brother was with a girl at one point, maybe: 
“... ok with me who you are with because ...”"
51,"Stay away from ""straight"" guys.  It's only a fantasy that will rarely work out. Trust me."
52,"My bf does this. A lot. And he'll literally dance with excitement if he's really into it. God help me when the next animal crossing is announced, he'll go into overdrive.

53,"If I woke up my boyfriend this way, he would punch me in the face lol"
54,"I used to volunteer doing LGBT awareness, this is what I'd say about religion in England: more LGBT discrimination comes from Christians by dint of them being the far bigger denomination, but Muslims as a group are much more discriminatory. 

Statistically the attitudes of Muslims in Britain are horrendous (90% non-acceptance of LGBT's in one of the latest surveys), but they're such a small and powerless group in politics/nationally it doesn't affect as many people; the majority of Christians (80%) are liberal towards LGBT but they - including that final 20% - make up more of our communities, run parties and decide our rights partly based on their ideals and faith.

If the choice is between a Christian neighbourhood and a Muslim neighbourhood though... Easy choice. "
55,This BF is doing the right thing.
56,All the time but it is sexual. 
57,"From the well known ones, Johnny Rapid. I dunno why, but he annoys the hell out of me. "
58,"The fact that he doesn’t want to hurt you even more shows that he has a deep affection for you that he doesn’t want to break. It’s hard to keep it platonic, but it might be helpful to find solace in the fact that he still loves you. It might not be the love that you want but there are also tons of much worse ways the situation could have panned out.
Best of luck to you working through it all. I think a lot of us can relate so you’re not alone friend."
59,"&gt;it also makes me feel like sex with me isn’t good enough so he has to ask me to do certain things

65,"I like to kiss, cuddle, and/oral. Anal sex is a turn off for me. I've had sex with quite a few people, and it's just not my thing. It sucks being a college student where I'm at because everyone is a bottom/top looking for anal. I feel like you can create a better connection through kissing, etc. And it's more intimate. I couldn't tell you how many guys just want you to come to their room, them ass up face down, and just fuck them. 
The hookup scene is not for me."
66,He continues to play hide and seek.  He's really good -- I still can't find him...
67,"Um, I'm no guru, but he said 'thats so sad', I think he was hinting that he might? Or is it a confirmed no? 

Also, so sorry for these feels, I know them all too well.

TL;DR - He played my liking of him, used me and then hurt and ditched me. Hurts so bad. But, we endure. We heal, and we move on.

I didn't know what to do at first but I used my superpower ([dutch directness](https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/dutch-culture-brutally-honest-people)) and flat out started a conversation with him about this.

anyway, told him i had no way of getting there because i’m gay so i can’t drive so he asks me for my address so he can pick me up and i stupidly give it to him. he comes pick me up and hes trying to make me feel all comfortable but i just feel weird but i just felt like i made the biggest mistake of my life. and then as we are near his house, he asks me a very fucking weird and strange question, well he asked for a request anyway.

so basically he told me that his neighbors are nosy as fuck and he didn’t want anyone seeing me enter his house so he told me that before we get to his place, if it was okay that we stop by somewhere so i can GET OUT OF THE FRONT SEAT AND MOVE TO THE BACK so NO ONE can see me. my immediate thought was “oh my god CHILD LOCK EXISTS AND HES GONNA RAPE ME WTF”. so i was just quiet and told him that i wasn’t comfortable doing that. and he was like “okay that’s fine”.

so we arrive to his place and because his neighbors are “so nosy” he told me that he’s gonna park in the garage and close the garage door first before i step out of the car. i was literally thinking i was gonna get murdered (i wasn’t in the best emotional state at this time of my life so i lowkey didn’t care THAT much but also cared, you feel me). so we just awkwardly sit in the car as he closes the garage door and then it’s all dark and shit and he steps out of the car and tells me to do the same.

so now we are at his place, which is his sisters place but no one else is home right now and he lays a whole bunch of pillows and blankets on the damn ground for us to lay down and watch a movie. okay cool i guess. so i was wearing jeans and he said he had a spare pair of shorts i can change into to get more comfortable and i was like “okay” so while he goes gets a pair of shorts for me, i deadass go onto google maps and get my exact location and send it to my friend in case something happens lmao.

he gets back and i change and then we just lay on the damn blanket covered ground and i was uncomfortable and he tried to cuddle with me and told me to touch him and i was like “i don’t want to...” and then he let out a big sigh of disappointment and moved himself away from me and i got scared lmao so i was like okay fine.

i reaches down to touch his cock and he was rock hard and then i ended up sucking him off and he tasted gross, like idk how dick is supposed to taste like but he didn’t clean or something that’s for sure. he asked me if it was really my first time sucking cock because he said i was really good which gave me a confidence boost but still made me feel weird.

anyway, fast forward to the fucking, i bottomed and it hurt and he was rough and even after i told him to stop, he kept going a bit more and i was just whimpering and scared because i didn’t know what to do. it felt good but it also really fucking hurt like bitch please be gentle. but i guess he finished and he didn’t even help me out so i didn’t even get to climax, and he walks to the bathroom to clean off and i’m just laying there wanting to die (again wasn’t in a good state of mind at this time) and i felt so gross and used. he comes back and he’s just on his phone and tells me i can use the bathroom to clean up, so i do. what a jerk. 

i feel my butt all wet and shit and figured it was lube so i got some toilet paper and wiped aaaaaand there was blood. kind of a lot of blood too. i panicked and i was scared and i was embarrassed. i had wipe a few more times to get all the blood off. so after my clean up, i head back to him and he tells me he has to pick up a friend from downtown so he can drop me off home.

he told me he had a great time and he wanted to have sex more and he thought it was hot that he was my first (EW!!!). and he told me he had a black friend with a 9 inch cock with the girth of a soda can and he wanted me to take his friends cock and i was literally so disgusted in the way i was being treated already. but i just acted cool calm and collected.

the ride home was weird and he kept holding my hand and i just let him because i was a bit worried. anyway he kept telling me we should meet up next week so he could fuck me again and i was just too disturbed to give a fuck (literally). 

fast forward to a few days, he keeps on messaging me on grindr and texting me and i tell him i’m not doing okay and to leave me alone so he got all mad and blocked me on grindr as if i was the one losing something. WHEW. good riddance.

anyway that was my worst hook up and for a while i was scared he would come to my house and break in or some shit but it’s been a while now soooooo i think i’m good lol. "

90,"I share everything bar underwear with my bf. 

I can’t even fathom why sharing deodorant would be considered weird. Do they think sharing toothpaste is weird, too?"
91,"I hooked up with a guy once and when I got to his apartment he was like 50lbs heavier than his picture and sweating profusely. Greasy hair, oily skin with a ton of acne that was clearly there because he didn’t shower. Whatever, I’m already here. Go to take his pants off, overwhelmed by smell of sweat and BO. Called it a day. Wasn’t feeling super polite, so I told him he stank and I couldn’t deal with it and left."
92,"It would annoy me  a little, but its not like straight people don't get described as ""the skinny guy"" or ""the black guy"" or ""the big girl"". 

I wouldn't assume that that's the only impression you've made on them, just that it's the easiest way for multiple people to understand who they're referring to if there aren't a lot of other gay guys around.

But if I have to be ""the gay guy"" I'd at least like to be ""the tall gay guy"" or the ""gay guy with a nice smile"" you know.  "
93,"Honestly I don't particularly struggle on Grindr and my profile is incredibly lazy- I don't get 10 messages a minute but I reply to more than I send. Its literally a picture of me at the beach, one sentence about me, and a list of things in the bio that I'm looking for. I have friends with far more interesting profiles who aren't the best looking guys and they struggle. I'm ngl, when I message a guy on Grindr I'm mainly basing that decision off his pictures, not his bio.

People on Grindr *are* shallow. Its a hookup app. People don't want to hook up with people they're not attracted to- which sucks for people who aren't conventionally attractive. I totally understand why some people complain."

101,Jesus are you ok?
102,"Little things that are done quietly.

Back when we first started dating, I had a day free and stayed at his while he went to work. Before he came back, he asked if I wanted anything, and I said I wanted a banana milkshake from McDonalds if he would be passing one.

He came back with the milkshake and I was very pleased.

We went out for dinner that night, and I looked for directions on his GPS. I then saw that the last search was for the nearest McDonald’s and he had driven out of the way to buy me the milkshake. Really, it’s a small thing, but I still remember it, 5 years later.

Another thing is when we had an argument while we were on holiday. We weren’t speaking and when we got back to the hotel I went straight to bed while he had a shower.

When he got out, he assumed I had fallen asleep already, and he lay down next to me and hugged me to sleep himself.

125,"I second this. This is a pretty cut and dry discussion. You need to consider your relationship as a whole (and none here can help you with that). If you're generally happy with your relationship then you might want to consider a conversation with your boyfriend. If you're not satisfied then it might be a good time to end it.

I would avoid taking to much advice from others. The truth is relationships are messy because none of us are prefect. It's just so easy to post an opinion here on Reddit because none of us just live with the consequences."

134,How does *not* linking it give it attention?
135,"There’s a lot at play here: his culture, his family, your culture, and you. I’m Thai, and my family wasn’t always so accepting. 

I think that he’s stood up to his family so far, which is encouraging. But you’ve also given an ultimatum: it’s either you, or his family. Though he’s already chosen to show how much he values your relationship, you’ve put him in a difficult spot. What would you do if the situation were reversed, and he asked you to make that difficult choice? Could you honestly say there would not be a seed of resentment that he took that choice away from you?

And to be honest - his family is also forcing him to make that choice, but it’s not about you specifically. They probably wouldn’t want ANY boyfriend coming. They’re forcing him to choose between family or being gay.

I think the best thing you could do is support his decision either way - if he decides to stay, his family might never speak to him again. That’s a terrible loss. If he chooses to go, it’s not because he doesn’t love you. It’s because he loves his family. And there’s probably enough love (from him) to go around. He’ll appreciate you all the more for being there for him."
136,Not really a hookup but I was talking to a guy on grindr and we agreed to go on a get-to-know-each-other date. I spent the date in horrified silence while listening to him talk. It turned out he was a hardcore racist with a diaper fetish. Then he asked if he could come up and suck some dick. I nope'd out of there.

142,"I don’t wanna speak negatively about your mother, but she sounds like the type of person I wouldn’t want to be around. The whole “you don’t see me complaining” thing is beyond annoying, not to mention passive aggressive and emotionally manipulative. You might have grown accustom to thinking that those are jokes, but they’re really not. 

Stop apologizing for her and claiming everything she says is a joke. One way or another, people say what they mean. Make it very clear that she hurt you, and what she does next will tell you all you need to know."
143,I feel like it’s more of a spectrum versus a category. 
144,"Precisely. 

Homosexuality was illegal in Catholic Ireland until 1993. 

It wasn't a change of heart in the good Catholics of Ireland that decriminalised homosexuality. 

[It was concerted civil rights movement following the homophobic murder of a gay man in Dublin in 1983.](https://gcn.ie/murder-created-dublin-pride/).

It was gay rights activists and civil rights lawyers (two of whom subsequently became the first and second women presidents of Ireland, but that's another story) taking the Irish state to the European courts and subsequent rulings from those courts that decriminalised homosexuality. 

It had nothing to do with the Church. 

If most of the largest denominations of Christianity had their way, homosexuality would be as persecuted in western Christian countries as it is in Islamic countries. "
145,The hell kinda mattress do you have that your boyfriend doesn’t wake up when you get on top of him? Put that shit on a Purple mattress commercial and I’m sold.
146,I would say Islam is considerably worse for gay people’s existence than Christianity at the moment. 
147,"On growlr, very cute guy that is into pup play.  Not my thing but chatted considering how cute he was.  He got into asking if I wanted him castrated and dick removed.

153,"Something else to add that I learned from my sociolinguistics class: sometimes male “gay” voice is actually just a lack of that straight male dialect. This is why nerds and geeks might also sound “gay”. 

And to go off your point about learning to speak like those you hang out with - dialect is spread not only by who you’re with, but more importantly by who you *identify* with (and this happens subconsciously). For example gay men might not identify with the stereotypical heterosexual male identity, and thus fail to pick up the “straight” accent regardless of whether they hang out with more men or women. They may have gay examples to pick up their dialect from, and this can be learned later in life, or choose to sample other dialects depending on how they identify with those around them. 

It’s an interesting question for us gay linguists! "
154,"I was chatting with this one guy for a couple days who I wasn't too sure about. He seemed cute but conversation didn't really click. Anyways we had been half trying to meet up for a drink (which i pretty much always do before anyone's house) but it never worked out. One morning I am hungover as can be and he was messaging me about hanging out. I was too sick to get out of bed and get a coffee so I told him he could bring me a coffee if he really wanted but that I can't get out of bed so don't expect much. 

He showed up with no coffee and 50lbs heavier than his pics. I was too hungover to argue and send him home so I just thought ""ugh i'm an idiot"" and opened the door and went back to bed. We just ended up like jacking off then he left. If he would have brought me coffee it woulda been 3/10 but he got 0.5/10"

159,"19 year old me decides to try a, comparatively, older guy who’s 35. He lives in a town we’ll call Greenberg, but I live a few towns over in a town we’ll call Rocky Stream. He can host, and offers to pick me up if I can get a little closer to him, so I take the train from Rocky Stream to Greenberg. He meets me at the train station and starts to drive me to his house. Now, Greenberg is a fairly nice neighborhood, but the entire car ride he goes on calling in “Crimeberg” and how there are creepy guys and “people who’ll rape ya, and people who’ll kill ya,” but “not to worry” because he’s “not one of those people.” 

So I immediately start to worry. But I go on anyway!

We get to his house and he says he lives with his brother, so I had to stay in the car until he gave me the signal to run into his garage to use the side door. That’s hella sketchy. But I go on anyway!

We get upstairs and we get in his bed and he turns on the news for some reason. We are cuddling and start kissing, and I start to go down to his produce section to taste his wares, but he grabs me by the shoulder and hugs me close to his chest. He whispers in my ear, “Don’t worry baby, daddy will take care of you. You don’t have to make daddy cum.” I say, “Hey, I’m not really into the daddy stuff.” He apologizes and then continues cuddling me in silence. Then he starts running his fingers through my hair and starts quietly singing in my ear, “Look at my beautiful baby boy.” I tell him to stop because it’s making me uncomfortable. But I go on anyway!

He cuddles me for about an hour in silence. It’s getting close to midnight now, I have class in the morning, and an hour train ride ahead of me. I say, “Hey listen I’m really enjoying this (I lied), but I have class in the morning so I sorta got to go soon.” He says, “Why don’t you sleep here?”
“It’s an 8AM class.”
“So we’ll get up at 6!”
“No. I’d really like to go.”
“Come on baby boy, stay with daddy.”

I snap.

“NO! FOR THE LAST TIME, I’M GOING HOME NOW. I HAVE A CLASS THAT I NEED TO GO TO AND A TRAIN I NEED TO CATCH.”
“How are you gonna get to the station?”
“I’ll take an Uber.”
“Don’t waste your money on that shit. I’ll drive you.”
Being a dumbass, poor, college kid, I have my doubts, but I go on anyway!

We sneak back out of his house past his brother, and I get in the car. He gets in and slams the door hard. He wildly backs out of his driveway and starts speeding through the creepy, wooded, hilly streets of Greenberg. The entire time he is almost screaming reminding me that, “The locals call this town Crimeberg. There are a lot of creepy guys. People who’ll rape ya. People who’ll kill ya. Lucky for me I’m not one of those guys.” He basically repeats this the entire car ride while driving crazy fast, and very recklessly. I was horrified, but tried to seem as composed as possible. We reach the train station and there’s about 5 minutes to my train.
“Okay, well thank you! I guess I’ll see you around!”
“Your train’s not for 5 minutes, you’re gonna freeze out there. Wait in here.”
Given his previous track record I was nervous to stay. But I go on anyway!

He offers me some gum and I take it.
“Doesn’t daddy get some gum?”
“I mean it’s your gum...you can have some if you want.”
“No, I want my baby boy to chew it for me.”

“What?”

“Chew it for me baby boy, and spit it in daddy’s mouth.”

I stall for like 30 seconds which is just enough time for the train to pull into the station.
“Sorry, I would, but my train’s here! Bye!” 
I quickly get out of the car and sprint onto the train back to Rocky Stream.

Nothing seriously harmful happened to me, but I count myself as lucky. After all, according to “Daddy,” Crimeberg is full of weirdos."
160,"Obviously I don’t know more than anyone else here, but I think this is closest to the truth. Being closeted (hiding that you’re gay)  puts a lot of stress on you. It’s very common for kids to be on edge around people when they’re hiding a secret. This break down could be the end result of him hiding part of who he his and marrying a women, and him coming to the realization that he’d been living a lie in which he wasn’t truly happy."

I wanted to leave but I felt bad. I let him fool around with me for a bit but he never got hard or anything. His place was kind of a mess and he just seemed depressed overall and I gathered that he was in a dead-end job that he was unhappy with. A very unpleasant experience.
170,"Not in the least bit.

It's campy, ridiculous, over the top, and dramatic. It showcases people at their best and their worst. It has amazing performances which surprise and horrible performances you can't stop watching. The artistry is incredible, and the queens are required to do so many kinds of things. It's a great show.

In addition to all that, it's queer. What the fuck else is on TV that is uniquely queer, which celebrates our history and culture, and doesn't apologize even a little bit? Almost nothing offers what Drag Race does. Sure, there might be some shitty people and petty drama on the show sometimes, but at the end of the day it's about turning out phenomenal looks and performances.

I will gladly and unapologetically proclaim that appreciating drag, maybe not RuPaul's Drag Race but the art itself, is central to a gay identity. It is *our* artform, and respecting that is a rebellion against oppression."

178,"Honestly the thing that bothers me the most is this:

&gt; Funnily one of our recent text chats, I have a dilemma with work, his response, ""oh youll figure it out, you're Asian, you're smart :)"".

I think it's totally fine for him to be more attracted to Asians. But this line shows he sees you more as ""an Asian"" than you for a person with specific characteristics. So he simply dismisses your trouble because ""an Asian is smart"".

I think you should talk to him about that. Maybe it won't work out between you two, but at least he'll learn to be more considerate with possible dates in the future."

189,"People talk to you on Grindr when you open it—new picture days are crazy. If a guy hasn’t said anything to you and you’re interested, you can usually just tap and there’s like a 60% chance he’ll respond first if he’s hot and a 95% chance if he’s avg or below. If you open the app on a car ride it’s like 20 new messages. You can get Grindr guys to do whatever your weird fetish is whenever you want basically. Grindr becomes like a Pokédex and you can pick whatever you’re in the mood for at any time. Average guys will uber you to their house. Lots of just for hookup guys try and escalate it to a relationship. People underestimate your intelligence. People touch your butt a lot at the dirtier gay clubs. Girls tell you and your boyfriend “it’s such a pity” all the time. 

My sex life is basically a struggle not to jerk off. If I can manage not to jo too much and waste my libido on porn, I can get a guy over whenever, to jerk me off, suck me off, etc. Sexual safety becomes urgently important tho because of the constant temptation so I get extremely choosy about who I’ll do risk-bearing stuff with. 

I’m a bit spoiled right now and therefore worried about losing all these little treats as I age. Before long, I’m going to have to find a different approach, and eventually prepare myself for an adjustment. "

If you're lucky enough that your boyfriend and you are the same size, enjoy the same style and use the same products, I certainly count it as a perk of dating the same sex. "
192,"Just start moaning ""Oh yeah! That's a good boy!  That's a good boy!  That's a very good boy!""

I was like ""are you...?""        
and he was like ""Johnny Rapid from the porn movies"".          

  
I can't explain to you what its like to see someone you've watched fuck over and over. And then also sort of get called out on it too lol.           

&amp;#x200B;

I can't even bring myself to watch him now."
197,I'm always depressed after jerking off because I'd rather be hooking up. I'm always depressed after hooking up because I'm still horny and let down by the hookup.
198,I would never use either word to describe myself. 
199,Uh oh spaghetti o’s
200,As someone from Pakistan. You're definitely right on that. You can get physically torn apart here by a mob. 
201,"Yup, there are asshats who hide under the title of ""dom"". They can go screw off. 

Doms are, in all honestly, subservient to the sub when it comes to sex. And in a power-balanced healthy relationship, they should be just as powerful as their partner. "
202,"Honest sorta depressing answer? For the more obvious gays, the only way we had to defend ourselves when we got made fun of in school was to fire back with a witty retort that made the guy calling us a faggot look like the loser in the situation.

""Shade"" and ""reading"" is built really deeply into our culture because most people see us a joke. We know we can't be taken seriously, so the only way to reclaim social power is to be the wittiest one in the room."
203,Behavior is a bigger factor in who “pings” my gaydar. 
204,"This is America. We don't just ""go to the doctor""."

208,Your mother is right. I got a yellow coat and it gave me the gay. 
209,"A guy wanted me to  ""tongue clean"" his 3 days unwashed ass.  I mean I love to rim but that thing better be fresh out the shower.

Another guys first message said that my hair looked really soft and he wondered if I would cut some off and give it to him."
210,"Some straight women do cause trouble at gay bars. But I usually reserve my hate only for ""girls night out"" types.

Gay bars are not a petting zoo.

&amp;#x200B;

I think if you go with someone who is LGBTQ+ then it's ok. As long as you remember that this space is not catering to you."
211,I’ve never had sex with someone from Grindr.
212,Hello everyone this is a public service announcement that this story is completely made up.
213,"I personally also dislike the word. I prefer to call myself gay or homosexual instead of queer, since the word has a nasty kind of connotation (for me personally)."
214,"And let's not forget it's the younger generation of muslims in the UK that are majority in wanting to make homosexuality illegal. Integration has failed, people!

Both religions are toxic as fuck. The dosage depends on the region of the globe you reside in."
215,"Bleh. I'm a Christian and I live in Scandinavia where the biggest churches are rather mellow. I don't have a problem with my congregation even if I don't see eye to eye with every single person there.

Your ways of looking at history are anachronistic and childish. Everything related to human cultures is in constant, slow, unpredictable flux. I don't hate democracy even though it started as a system of decision-making involving only wealthy, educated men. Nor do I hate my country for the fact that women and the poor didn't have voting rights before only about a century ago. I don't hate psychology as a practice and field of research because of how the insane were treated a hundred years ago. I don't hate our justice system because it used to condemn people to death. Et cetera et cetera.

You are obviously free to judge whatever you want however you want. I'm fine with my faith, thanks."
216,"his extended family is effectively a bunch of random people from the phillipines who have zero effect on your life, save for the condition you placed that they need to know who you are in order for you to be happy

you're creating your own issues buddy"
217,Then you don't find him attractive at all dipshit. You just like parts of his personality.
218,[deleted]
219,"But you removed all of the hyperlinks and charts which were in his article, as well as his author bio which has things like his twitter handle which people might have wanted to see if they want to see what else he's written.

Having people read it on the website also tells Vox that this is the sort of content people want to see and they should have more of. If an article is good, it should be given clicks/views to show that.

Plus link posts make it easier to see ""related discussions"" where other subreddits discuss the same article."
220,"&gt; Honestly I don't particularly struggle on Grindr and my profile is incredibly lazy-

Basically, the more attractive you are, the less you have to work to attract someone. I wish this were more obvious to people, but it's a harsh truth that a lot tend to overlook.

Along the same lines, it's so annoying getting a tap or a ""hey"" from a basically empty profile (landscapes and average-looking torsos included). It's like, do they think I'm desperate enough that I'll take a chance on such a ""risky"" interaction? Maybe that works sometimes, but I think the same principle applies here."
221,Here in Italy eating a whole pizza alone is perfectly normal
222,"I don't hang around people who say ""that's so gay and stuff"", because I'm neither chronologically or mentally a 14 year old anymore. I seriously haven't heard the phrase ""that's so gay"" in years."
223,... andddd other times... it does.
224,Yeah but that’s where they belong. 
225,That I think about him when I masturbate.
226,These comments are great jerk off material. 
227,"Im not even that old but i have this to say to the younger generations. And going from my own experience.

-Don’t let apps and social media (followers likes ect) influence your self worth. 8/10 its fake/bought anyway. 

-If something seems too good to be true, generally it is! 

-Don’t think that getting in a relationship will fix your own problems. Learn to fix yourself cause in reality, no one’s going to do it for you. 

As the famous saying goes ‘If you can’t love yourself, how the hell you gonna love somebody else?’ "
228,"Im currently on grindr for friends, when its a state like GA its hard to find gay friends and grindr helps with that since its mostly small towns "
229,fuck you sound like a very good lover
230,I try and have sex with them   :-(
231,"Disappointment should not be the first emotion someone feels upon meeting you.  I remember meeting up with guys whose pictures were a few years older and several pounds lighter.  They then accuse you of being shallow and fixated on looks.  No, you were dishonest.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember meeting one guy and he was unrecognizable.  He had gained at least 50 pounds from his pic and lost quite a bit of hair.  I had to look very hard at the profile pic to even realize it was the same guy.  He was also a perfect tool in person, so I went home just angry that I had wasted my evening on him."
232,And then they message you and get mad when you don’t respond to a faceless profile
233,Sometimes you have to be truthful. 
234,"Nah, it's sort of making me feel better about my hookups. "
235,"The artist formerly known as Twink

236,You might be intimidating. I have resting bitch face and guys tell me that they feel I'm unapproachable 
237,"Isn’t breaking up with him if he decides to not miss his sister’s wedding, even though he already showed what he thinks about the situation, throwing him under the bus? You’d literally be making him choose between his sister, the most accepting member of his family, and you. "
238,"Hey, you're not alone but I see this to be a problem myself. If porn is getting in the way of you having an awesome fulfilling sex life, that's no good.

Cause ultimately, sex does bring two ppl together. And it hurts to know that one don't even measure up to his partner's fantasy.

Try stopping it and only get sexual release from sex. Or porn-less masturbation. You need to train your brain to be sensitive to sex again and release as much dopamine. Long and lengthy process...."
239,"A self identified ""dominant"" man is asking that you go along with (everything) that he asks for because he is perfect and could never improve. I'm a submissive bottom but I dont let anyone push me around. 

Yes I agree with you"
240,The movie is very relatable. Except that Im broke ass unlike simon haha. 
241,Can it not be super depressing for once?
242,"this happened February 2016, I’m not traumatized by this but it was definitely a lot to take in afterwards, I became a lot more inquisitive for future hookups to try to avoid anything like this from happening again"
243,Maybe just the tip.....
244,"The dynamics of a dom/sub relationship is *not* the ""dom"" doing whatever they like and the sub meekly dealing with whatever happens. Get that 50 shades of Grey horseshit out of here. That's *abuse*, not BDSM.

A properly functioning Dom/Sub relationship in a roundabout way could be said to cater to the sub's fantasy which the dom merely fulfills. The play only ever goes so far as the sub is comfortable with/enjoys and they - not the dom - hold the ultimate power of ""No, stop, I don't want to do that"". 

Doms are subservient to the sub because it's the sub who defines the boundaries of the play."
245,Trimmed with smooth balls
246,"Leave it and him alone because wasting your time and sanity on what could be a closet case, or what could be a straight guy looking for someone to fluff his ego isn't good for you"
247,Ok now you have to show us the coat
248,"I don’t get any of this mentality. I mean why put yourself in a box like that? Like even if your straight what’s wrong with stylish colorful clothes and style and looking good? 
Like somehow wanting stylish and colorful clothes and hair makes you gay and that’s somehow bad?"
249,Me when while sucking my grindr hookup he's using the phone and I don't know if he is recording me. 
250,"&gt;He kissed me at the end of the first date tho, ok the lips,friends that kiss each other? Strange right?

Or maybe hes just a shitty human that was misleading you, and the kiss was just to validate him. Wouldn't surprise me. If i kissed someone anywhere, at the end of a date (especially a first one), I would be indicating  genuine romantic/physical interest in them. 

Reading your other replies on this thread, it looks like hes upsetting you - drop him before he sucks out your soul.  I'm serious dude :/ its not healthy to dwell over toxic guys like him"
251,But i'm not interested in guys that aren't straight and are interested in me
252,"Yup. :)

One thing moreso true in younger generations today and often especially true in LGBT people is the ability/need to pick people to be part of your family. "
253,But this load I have building inside me is 100% real 
254,"She literally hesitated and said people will be thinking you're.....wierd, then I was like for a yellow coat (which is a beast btw) and she said 'people will be thinking you're gay' for like the 6th time. I dunno if it's a prompt to do it or what. I'm moving out in 4 months. Gonna do it then tbh"
255,Look for a new job
256,"Save the messages. Call him up or head over to see him and confront him with it. The issue here is NOT that you snooped or whatever, but that he is doing it. You can admit you wavered in trust and did that, but that is NOT the issue and you will not be talking about that further (don't let him try to spin it onto you and that). I assume you aren't in an open relationship, so he has a lot of explaining to do. He needs to tell you why, whether this is the first time, if he has hooked up with others without telling you etc.. Based on that you can decide if you want to stay together and work on it, or if you are done-sky. If he refuses to talk about it, is coy, or lies about it... it's over. 

I am sorry this happened to you :(. Been there myself. We were able to figure it out, but it took a lot of concession  and effort to understand why it happened on my part - and by no means was it easy. I still lack trust at times. I am glad I did in the end, but I would have been 100% justified in kicking him to the curb."
257,It’s called the Gay Handshake. 
258,"I don't believe in absolutes like that, but I guess most straight people (not just men, women too) don't realize how good it is to have 90%~ of the people you see in streets being of a compatible sexuality.

Can you imagine how good it would be to just casually flirt with another guy, wherever you are? To just be able to develop a relationship with another single guy, and most often than not he'd be into a compatible sexuality, so the friendship might develop into something further."
259,"You'll know once you have a prostate orgasm.  I bottomed on and off for a little while, never liking or disliking it.  'Til I had a bf who was strictly a top.  At first it was a no-go for me.  But dude knew how to fuck and I've never had an orgasm like it since.  Only time in my life I was able to cum back to back.

Dick was good but holy hell was he fucked up."
260,"Growing up with acne and acne scars, im very cautious about my skincare, and no matter how much I work on it, sometimes it doesn't work well. I just do my best to keep a clean clear skin.

Apparel wise, I just let my basic design sense guide me. I won't make too much of an impression on a day to day, but wouldn't be sloppy. On certain occasions though, I'd put more effort, like a party or something.."
261,"Have you looked at r/raisedbynarcissists ?
"
262,"Your boyfriend did more than enough. 

I could understand your point if 

1) he wasn’t out to his parents - he is 
2) decided to go to the wedding without you - he won’t 

So I can’t see your problem.

He clearly placed you over them. 

And I can’t understand why is it important that his extended family knows about you? For example I haven’t had no contact with my extend family for years now so why should I come out to them? They don’t even know what I’m doing in my life. And probably that’s the case with  our boyfriend‘s extended family. 

You were lucky to be born in Canada and have an accepting family. Not all people have that. So don’t be so fast to judge other people based on your own experience. "
263,"You don't have to feel bad for him. Cheating is always wrong but if he cheated while dependent on you he's extra awful and deserves no pity.

Leave. And take the dog too."
264,I used to do that to my ex boyfriend and he's not really a very loud guy or someone who likes to moan so I squeeze as hard as I can and take out those sweet moans from him
265,Uh....three way??? HELLO?!!
266,"I exhausted a lot of my generosity in that one encounter, to be fair!"
267,"&gt;learn how to hold a conversation

At my age it's normal to be aroung/hang out with anyone in the 22-30 range and I swear everyone is able to guess who is under 23 because they're completely incapable of holding a conversation. "
268,"#YOU ARE SUFFICIENT

Don't let life kick your ass, there will be ups and downs, no life is a party without a hangover, and even rich rich money won't buy happiness. When the shit gets deep, Don't swim in it, get a plunger. "
269,"dude you need to break up with this guy, he believes he and his cousin are soulmates. there is no competing against that, especially if they kicked you out of your own home."
270,hello everyone im single and ready to talk to you for 40 straight minutes about space channel 5 part 2 
271,"Totally fine :). I don't think you really screwed up at all. It's OK to not want to have sex on a first date - and he knows it was your first date. If he is a good guy, he won't care. If I were him, I'd have probably found that enduring in a goofy kind of way. Anyway, don't sweat it even if it turned him off to you for further dates. Dating is about learning about yourself as much as it is the other guy. It will get easier in time :) "
272,"My favorite story was when my mom saw me kiss a boy for the first time, and said ""I love you, but I don't want to see it."" I said, ""what are you going to do at my wedding, look away?"" She shut up really quickly."
273,Yeah but I also think there’s a thing where the best guys don’t use grindr because they don’t need to. 
274,"I think we will. School starts in less than a week, but he texted me saying he still wants to hang out before then. I think I can safely say I won’t lose him. "
275,"Agreed. It's a shit situation, but i don't know what more his boyfriend can do. "
276,If there’s a genuine connection you will definitely be able to see past physical “flaws” or whatever you want to call them.
277,Don’t follow people on Instagram. Just cats
278,"Personality doesn’t really change, nice, sweet and decent guys don’t come around often. There’s lots of folks with less than desirable personalities. Just ask on here loads of folks will have experiences. The good ones are a dime a dozen. 

Physical attributes like weight, body hair and other stuff you’ve described change, AND do change. At 20 I didn’t look like I do now. Studying, Office jobs, long hours and stress takes it out on you. 

Being able to call my bf my best friend because he is nice, sweet and decent is awesome. As opposed to not a bf who is a total shit that drives me up the wall but good looking.

Priorities bud. Priorities. "
279,Cut your losses. This gay has a lot of baggage
280,Nope but dang you're attractive
281,"We live for these stories and pretend to hate them. Please, do go on."
282,"I'm a virgin and wanted to donate blood, but when I went they told me I looked underweight and underage and therefore refused. I took it as a compliment that I looked young and skinny so I wasn't even mad."
