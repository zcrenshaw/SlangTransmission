0,So where's that selfish cunt Caitlyn Jenner now?
1,"Maybe he's gay.  

When I was not out yet, I would be that staring guy.   You and your boyfriend would have been a great curiosity to me, and seeing you ""in the wild"" like that would have not only held my attention in that moment, I'd be thinking about it for the rest of the day.  "
2,"I want to address the comments here that trans people not being able to work in the military 'makes sense' because of mental health disparities. 

The main reason there is a logical flaw in the argument is that - it assumes psychiatric co-morbidity is an intrinsic part of being trans. But there is stronger evidence to show that is not the case, and the disparity is driven by external factors:

1) There is a lot of robust research that finds LGBT mental health is negativly affected by 'minority stress' - the idea that structural discrimination (e.g. bathroom bans) and social exclusion (e.g. family rejection) is the source of psychiatric morbidity. Even in the LGB population, meta-analysis finds that depression and suicidal ideation is about 3 times higher than the general population. However, the disparity between LGB and general population is closing in recent decades because of better social acceptance. 

2)Another explaination for the disparity is that mental and general healthcare for trans patients (and LGB patients) in North America is really lacking, and most physicians are not trained in working with this population (e.g. no training in HRT clinical protocols, how to deal with trans abuse at home and school, etc.)

It makes no sense to systematically exclude groups of people who are at higher risk of mental health problems like Native Americans, so why use it for trans?

7,"I‚Äôm glad you are figuring out your sexuality bro! Just a side note- please make sure you are using protection. Bottoming for a guy and letting him cum in you is very risky, especially since you just met him. I know I might sound like a mom or a prude, but really... use protection if you are going to bottom at all (or look into getting PREP)! "

18,"Someone deleted their comment while I typed a response, so I'll post it here anyway. I was asked why I think I'm gay, and not bi/pan, and whether or not this experience has made me stop finding women sexually attractive.

&amp;#x200B;

My response:

&amp;#x200B;

Kind of, yeah.  It's more made me realize that I didn't see the signs to consider that I wasn't ever truly sexually attracted to women.  I thought I had a relatively low libido and needing a long time between being intimate. But I've realized that it was only because that was how long I needed to become horny enough to be aroused by a woman.  

&amp;#x200B;

Women have never made me go from not being horny at all to being aroused, which never struck me as odd. But men do.  I actually get turned on thinking about Pete, or other men now. I don't just want to orgasm during sex, or even just want to get my partner off.  All three male partners I've had have shown me that when sleeping with a man, I am so into what's happening that I almost never want to cum because I don't want to stop kissing them, feeling them, being intimately entangled in each other, etc.  

&amp;#x200B;

I think this is how my sex drive is always SUPPOSED to have worked.  For example, five minutes after I finished with my tinder date, he came back from the bathroom and just looking at his dick still shiny from the lube turned me on again and I wanted him.  When Pete got dressed this morning, he wore a tight shirt and seeing his form accentuated was actually sexy.  I never realized I was missing it, but even though I appreciated a woman's body, it never got me feeling like I wanted to touch them or undress them.  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I was ever really sexually attracted to women. I think I just assumed I was, so I slept with them when I was horny, dated women I got along really well with, etc.  But Pete has made me feel like there's another dimension to relationships I had never known about. I really think that even though I had said it many times, I was never in love with any past girlfriend.  

&amp;#x200B;

I feel something for Pete way more significant than I've ever felt for someone else.  Regardless of what happens between us, I don't think I would date a woman again.  It's like I never realized I was freezing until I felt warmth, and now I realize how much better and ""right"" it feels. "
19,Clear open communication about what you both want. Be vulnerable and share insecurities. Compromise is the foundation of any good relationship. 
20,It‚Äôs somewhat common now for guys to not necessarily be exclusive to one another if they‚Äôre just dating but putting the title of boyfriend is to make it more official/exclusive.
21,"I wouldn‚Äôt be offended by it. He may have been genuinely curious. He wasn‚Äôt rude, besides the weird staring. It‚Äôs possible he‚Äôs never come across an out gay couple before. Seeing you two being a perfectly normal couple out doing the same things he was doing with his girlfriend may have made a positive impact in his life. "
22,"This would have been me out shopping with my ex-wife, wondering, ‚ÄúWhat would that be like?‚Äù (Especially if the guys were attractive.)"
23,"I have a bad habit of staring at gay couples but only because they make me so happy and fill me with bubbly glee when I see them. I'm also a big black guy with resting bitch face (or as I call it, angry nigga face). I can easily see someone interpreting my looks as hate but it's the exact opposite.

As for the acting awkward and flustered, that'd be me if one or both of you were particularly cute.

In other words don't read too much into it! I've learned it's easier to assume the best, I don't assume someone's being racist until they make it undeniable. Same when I was with my bf, we got a lot of stares but I would just assume they were surprised or something. I know it wasn't true for all of them, maybe not even half, but I held my head high anyways. "
24,"That could be it but also he might have always found some guys hot but never thought 2 guys could be in a relationship so he suppressed that feeling and decided to date a girl he likes because he was taught that a man must be with a woman and he mustve temporarily got confused at what he was seeing.

If what I said is true then I have a feeling that guy will probably dump her as he starts exploring him self more. "
25,This is such high quality bullshit I don't know what to think.
26,"Yet they gave her a pile of awards for ""bravery"" when she transitioned and came out. It shows just how empty these institutions are, and how meaningless their awards have become."
27,"Am straight man. Can confirm I will not be gay anytime soon. 



I just come here because I love you all and want to support you however I can. Gay men have been some of the most compassionate, kind, and caring people I have ever met in my life. I'm not sure if I've just been very fortunate, but that's been my experience.



But seriously. Your straight friend probably will not be interested. Sorry :("
28,"Thank you!üò≠
We're hopeful we will one day live freely!

I always wonder what it's like to live in a country that everything LGBT is legal."
29,"Eh, depends.

The scale most of the guys I know run with is:
- **Talking**: Couple weeks, texting, a few dates, sex.
- **Dating**: Moved past just talking, decided you‚Äôd like to continue seeing each other past than the first couple dates. This usually lasts a couple (2ish) months.
- **Exclusive**: Boyfriend, blah blah blah. Past just dating, you‚Äôre applying labels, staying over at one or the other‚Äôs regularly, etc.

Usually when you‚Äôre ‚Äúdating‚Äù is when you have the conversation about having sex other people, etc.

The distinction here is that dating is this intermediate point where you‚Äôre getting to know each other, finding out if it‚Äôs just lust (which usually burns itself out in a month or two) or if you‚Äôre genuinely falling for each other.

Part of this, I think, is because of the trope of gay men showing up with a new boyfriend every week.

Otherwise, by your standard, everything between the first date and applying a label to your relationship is just ‚Äúhanging out/having sex‚Äù."
30,"Dating but not boyfriends‚Äî like I‚Äôve been seeing this guy for a couple months but we aren‚Äôt boyfriends even though we are dating because we haven‚Äôt talked about things like being exclusive, etc"
31,"I'm sorry but the military is not a social experiment. It's a fighting force. They need to be in the best shape possible. Nobody has the right to serve.

If an individual transitions they now require hormonal supplements (this is what I have been told by trans friends) and the issue with this is if you miss a dose, it can/will fuck you up. The last thing you need when you are deployed is to have someone in your section/platoon be cut off from their hormones when bullets start flying. 

I'm sorry but this is my opinion. Should their be science or studies proving that trans individuals do not require daily hormones supplements post op then I'd change my mind. But from my experience and what I've been told says otherwise"
32,"""in the wild"""
33,"As someone who made a seven-year long-distance relationship work, I give you these nuggets of wisdom:

- Compromise where you can, but make sure it goes both ways.
- Enjoy the silence together. Not everything needs to be exciting, for you to enjoy time together. 
- Communicate. If you think something should be obvious I assure you, it‚Äôs not. No one in your relationship is a mind reader, so don‚Äôt assume anything.
- Don‚Äôt overthink his every action. If something bothers you, talk it out. Don‚Äôt just jump to conclusions.
- Be respectful of boundaries. Keep secrets to a minimum and only keep them as necessary, but respect each other‚Äôs privacy. 
- Work on your problems. Don‚Äôt go to bed angry. That said, know when enough is enough and know when it‚Äôs time to move on. He deserves the best boyfriend in you, and you deserve the same from him. 

Of course, not all of this works for everyone, but hopefully it does work for you. I don‚Äôt know you but I am genuinely very happy for you. I hope you two make each other happy for as long as possible! &lt;3"
34,That is fucking sad:(
35,My professor in my sling. 
36,"If the straights had found the solution to why people are gay they would have stomped it out of us by now. 

Most of the science suggest a combination of nature, nurture, genetics, environment, social circles, geopolitical location, formative childhood experiences....... anyone can wind up non-heteronormative. 

Though in developed countries with progressive laws of sex and gender, that typically accounts for about 10% of the population, similar to the distribution of left-handed people. 

"
37,Umm....so what exactly where they before this?
38,"That was quite a long read, but I am going to make this very clear. Get out if this relationship as soon as you can. PUT AN END TO IT. There are red flags everywhere. He has been unfaithful, lied about it, sacrificed quality time with you in order to have meaningless sex with other men. He has been reckless with his own health and yours in the process. 

Another solution could be that you two decide to change to an open relationship, but that requires tremendous trust and clear rules and boundaries.

If he claims that he will never do any of this again, you need to open your eyes, because that will probably not happen. What he did to you was not a one time thing. It was planned, on a regular basis and without any guilt until the moment you caught him."
39,"She also said that she believed marriage to be between a man and a woman, so fuck her.

I guess she only wants tolerance for her views and life, not anyone elses."
40,Everyday. I‚Äôve seen some of the hottest things ever here. Won‚Äôt lie. 
41,"I had always looked at guys and fantasized sexually about them, but I never considered myself gay. I had this idea of what a gay man was, that stereotypical flamboyant guy who wears short shorts and colorful attire. I didn't identify with that so I thought that wasn't me. I thought someday I'd just be married and have kids but I never thought of who I'd be married to (in other words, I never imagined having a wife. Just being married). 

It wasn't until I met this guy at work who I became good friends with. I left the job after 9 months, due to a 90-minute commute, but we kept in touch. Eventually he came out to me as gay, and I came out to him as questioning. It wasn't until I met this ""normal guy"" that happened to be gay that I identified with the label. In fact, I even struggled with the label because I didn't want to put myself into a proverbial box. As it turns out, that friend and I experimented a few times. 

He mentioned a conversation with his mom and how she was asking if I was gay too, and suddenly I felt pressured to accept that I was gay and to come out. I pumped the breaks and said maybe we should just be friends. So over the next year and a half I slowly but surely accepted that I am a gay man. Mind you, I was 28 at the time. 

Once o accepted that I was gay, I realized that this friend had all the qualities that I looked for in a mate. Friendly, family-oriented, ambitious, intelligent, kind, funny, loves animals, loves traveling, loves food. I always had the best times with him, and I was always the best version of myself around him. I realized that I wasn't just gay, but I was in love with my best friend. 

As we discussed getting an apartment together (as roommates), I realized I couldn't live with him unless I told him how I felt. And so I did. I cried, I felt like I had made a huge mistake in pumping the breaks a year and a half before. He was caught off-guard. I was heartbroken. It turns out he felt the same but he was apprehensive about dating me because I pumped the breaks before, and he didn't want to risk our friendship. 

...and then he said ""but I guess some risks are worth taking."" I got teary eyed, smiled, and we shared the most passionate kiss I had ever had in my life. That was February 16th, 2016. 

Today, we share an apartment near the beach, we are engaged to be married, and currently looking to buy a house together. He has been the most influential person in my life, he taught me to see the great guy that I never knew I had inside. I'm my best thanks to him, and my life was incomplete before him. Every day I find new ways to love him, but most importantly new ways to love myself. OP, I am so happy to know you're taking similar steps, but your journey is your own. Just know that there is no feeling like going to bed at night knowing you are living your life as your genuine self, learning to love yourself, and learning to let someone get close enough to love the real you. Cheers, and I truly wish you the best!"

45,"This guy probably lurks here still and he deleted his original thread on AGB, but it was about how he considers himself ""straight"" and met some fem dude at the gym who apparently flirted with him there.  One thing led to the next and they had been fucking everyday for two weeks.  According to him, it was the first time he had ever done this and he didn't know what to do. 

Now, I happened to stumble across his thread because his username is the same as his kik name.  I Googled his kik name first and that's how I found his ridiculous thread. His thread was nothing but lies since kik shows publicly how many days you've had your account (his was 5 years+) and he's in every single top/bottom public kik group in our area.   

Needless to say, don't believe everything you read on the internet, especially if it's coming from someone calling themselves ""straight"" in a thread geared towards gays.  Also, change up your online usernames at least especially if you want to be so ""discreet"". "

48,"I feel like using that as a justification would set a really troubling precedent as well, because, as you said, it's the ""minority stress"" that's the problem, which is not unique to the ""T"" in LGBT or even to LGBT people. Not hard to extend the same logic to other minority groups, especially if their protections and status are eroded. Isn't this also kind of the same argument they had with women in combat? ""More medical issues"", ""more emotional"", ""having them around might cause social or morale issues"", etc.. - you don't even have to be a true minority, just considered ""lesser"", for them to start making these kinds of excuses.

52,"The guilt of having lied to your parents will always be with you - but you are were a child.

And even though the 'man who forced you to cam' wasn't real, the fact remains that the guys you were in contact with WERE getting sexually involved with a minor.

Teenagers are sexually explorative, and the internet and smartphones has made that world far more accessible - but it's also made it easier for predators to hone in on their targets. While you were complicit, you were a minor, and in most legal jurisdictions, the victim - whether you wanted to interact with those men or not. As the legal adults in the situation, they should have known better and steered clear.

Also, I'm sure you're correct in believing that your parents knew it was a lie. Kids are terrible liars - and the fact that the police never got involved and nothing else came of it is probably evidence enough that they didn't suspect real foul play. That's how I would reason it, anyway.

I hope you can move beyond this experience and open up more around who you are, and now as an adult, be more free to experience those feelings and desires that were shaken up back then. Also, hopefully you have your own privacy now, too!"

But if that‚Äôs not you, then that‚Äôs not you. Don‚Äôt try and be something you‚Äôre not, is my opinion. Always makes me sad when guys feel the need they have to butch it up for the sake of societies norms. Heck, even some of my straight guy friends are very feminine acting. Embrace that shit!

My ex-boyfriend was pretty flamboyant and liked to color his hair and just the way he talked you knew he was gay right off the bat. I think it intensified our bond, because my instincts told me I had to be there and ready to protect him from any haters. I wanted to be his strong man by his side. But the thing is he really did not need me to protect him. He was fine on his own and always projected this unshakable confidence.

55,"Diabetics cannot deploy in the military. Their medical requirements put them at risk and put a burden on the military when in the field.

The Trans ruling is mostly based on medicine. They already cannot deploy for this reason.

I think the line needs to be drawn between medical and personal issues. If a trans person has no medicinal requirements, there is no reason why they couldn‚Äôt serve. However, if they change their mind and decide to go on HRT, that is 100% ok and their choice, but the military can no longer use them because of their required medication.

I do not doubt this law is motivated by at least a little prejudice, but there are also medically valid reasons for it.

When you combine these mental health issues with the amount of stress military service places on its members, it can do a great deal of harm to these individuals. It is preferable for those diagnosed with gender identity disorders to seek treatment and life away from institutions such as the armed forces for all involved."

He was wearing well fitted grey sweat pants and I could see the outline of a huge dick through them, I thought it must have been morning wood. Our eyes met and he shot me a sly grin, I turned away quickly and looked down at my book. I was mortified, he totally caught me salivating at the sight of his dick. The sound of something slamming down on my desk snapped my out of my embarrassment stupor. I looked up, confused at the sight of a giant water bottle in front of me.


""You looked thirsty,"" a rugged, deep, voice came from my left.


""I-I guess I am,"" I stutter and awkwardly laugh as I turn to look at him.


To my surprise he's staring right at me and stroking his dick from the outside of his sweat pants. It looks way bigger than before. My eyes bulge, my lips quiver, my pants bulge, my ass quivers.


""I thought I could offer you something to drink,"" he smirks and looks down.

80,"Agreeing with TB54, it is quite the debate.

Personally, I have had the opportunity with two girls and absolutely nothing happened. No twitch, no sign of life down below. But that is me and sexuality is on an undefined grey scale. It is so much more than gay, straight boxes.

Getting back to your boyfriend being gay, bi. Instead of wondering if he is or not (though he told you he was not). You need to ask yourself why it bothers you so much.
It was in the past. There is a chance of the guy you're with has had previous partners before you. That's life.
If you can't get past this and believe him when he says he is not gay, bi. Then you need to have a talk with him.

Tell him how you are feeling. But, I warn you. This talk will have consequences.  He will most likely not trust you with stuff. He will most likely keep certain things about his life that he feels you will judge him on.

If that is what needs to be for you to be comforted. Then, so be it.
Let me just end it on this note, we are strangers. We don't know you and we don't know your boyfriend. We don't know how he feels. But being in a relationship requires trust. If you trust him, then you have to believe that what happened before you was just a thing. But if you don't trust him. Then there is no relationship. 

"
81,"Try to not completly forget him but keep him as a sweet memory of what you once had even if it was small.

83,"Since everyone else is just trashing your ex and repeating back what you want to hear, I‚Äôll go the other way. This story comes off as one-sided and tries to make him look bad. But, it sounds like the real story is that you two want very different things. Being incompatible about where you would want to live and how you guys spend money is a big deal, and It‚Äôs good that he recognized that early. Ambition is something very important that a lot of people look for in a partner. It isn‚Äôt elitist to want someone ambitious. And as for him still being a student - he‚Äôll be a doctor one day and will very likely be able to afford the things he wants on his own, but the doesn‚Äôt mean he wants to have to support his partner. He might be looking for someone where money wouldn‚Äôt be an issue and both of them can afford that lifestlye. He doesn‚Äôt want to be financially supporting his partner in the future. 

These are all reasonable things. Yeah, it sucks that it didn‚Äôt work out, but it seems like he is making s smart decision and that the relationship wouldn‚Äôt have worked out. It‚Äôs better that you guys came to that conclusion quickly before they really became problems. "

There's the gender dysphoria, which is the person not feeling like their body is how it should be.  That's internal, and this is stronger for some more than others, of course.  A somewhat strong case would be an 8 year old boy perpetually tucking his junk because he feels like he should be smooth in front, unaware of what this feeling means. 

Then there's the harassment and oppression of expression, which is entirely dependent on other people. 

Take away the harassment, and you've got someone with a disorder that may range from severe to mild. But if they want to do the work and are capable, then by all means, they should. They won't be the first people in the military with some sort of disorder causing them discomfort. 

Note: I say ""disorder"" to mean something persistently causing them discomfort, not to say that there's something wrong with them."

91,It‚Äôs just so odd she‚Äôs so absent as a trans conservative woman. Conservatives jerk off to the military all the time and yet she‚Äôs nowhere to be found

96,"So your problem is that you couldn't feel anything while inside him and that you've made sure that the condom and lube is not the numbing type? Hm.. Maybe your condom is just too thick for you to feel anything? Or maybe your dick is currently desensitized and you can only feel pleasure from masturbating yourself... if that's the case, you could try edging everday and not cumming for a week or two."
97,This took a wild turn from a few weird stares.
98,"Gender dysphoria absolutely is a mental illness, but equating that with being trans is disingenuous and misses the point. The two are separate things. 

A person who suffers from gender dysphoria because they are not living as the gender they feel they are is not dysphoric because they're trans.  They are dysphoric because they can't live honestly as who they are.

If you rhen tranaition and feel right with who you are, you have cured your dysphoria.  Being trans isn't causing the illness, it is living in a way that doesn't fit with their perception of who they are that causes it. For many people, being trans and transitioning is the cure.

103,"I'm being a bit glib. I understand that this will negatively affect trans people who are either in the military or want to be, whether that be for a genuine will to serve or just due to there being no other good options for them. 

BUT as far as I'm concerned, the military is a criminal organization that causes untold misery across the globe. Nondiscrimination against trans people would not make the military one iota better than what it is now. What we need is not more trans drone pilots, but rather to abolish drone strikes."
104,I deactivated my Facebook and Instagram and felt better. Lol. Gave me more time and motivation to work on myself and learn new stuff workwise.
105,That was kind of implied
106,"There are plenty of trans people who don't have any other mental health issues and the hormones and plenty of cis people who take daily medications for other things. Also, the hormone injections required by FTM trans men are monthly (not sure about the frequency for MTF trans women but it still shouldn't matter). Trans people have already been serving without issues."
107,All I have to say if they have to start drafting in some future war like they did in Vietnam. My response : Did you try recruiting any transgendered? I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre volunteers more than willing to join but you banned them remember. You must not need recruits that bad if you blocking a whole group from joining.
108,"Uh, no.

First: Let‚Äôs stop using the word ‚Äúeasily‚Äù, please. Fearmongering is so pass√©.

Now, facts:
- HIV is fairly difficult to transmit accidentally (not impossible, but not easy). Infection rates are about 1.4-1.6% per incident of anal sex as the bottom, with a positive and detectable top. Infection rates are a fraction of that for negative tops, positive and detectable bottoms.
- PrEP has failed 4 times, in billions if not trillions of sex acts since it started
- The risk for liver damage associated with Truvada is very low; it‚Äôs seen in instances where the person is on multiple, liver-straining medications, has cirrhosis, or some other condition that helps overload the liver.
- Condoms are not a catch-all, and are not 100% effective when used 100% correctly. Every single STD can still be contracted even if you properly use a condom 100% of the time.

I‚Äôm going to highlight this point for you:

#Condoms fail many, many, MANY times more often than PrEP does, and you‚Äôre being irresponsible as fuck spread shit like this.

The **only** way to protect yourself from STDs with a 100% guarantee is to **never, ever have sex with anyone, including in a committed relationship**.

More realistically, you can mitigate the risk:
- PrEP for HIV
- Using a condom correctly and consistently
- Get tested frequently and regularly
- Know your partner, know their status"
109,"If you are that bitch, own the fuck out of it. That's my advice, I personally find it very hot when guys are flamboyant and straightforward with me. Not because I'm too ""masc"", it's rather amusing to be with someone who embraces all of his sides. Good luck "
110,One of the things people don't realize about sexuality is that sexual orientation and romance are not the same thing. The two usually are correlated with each other but not always. There are plenty of bisexual people that are hetero-romantic. It's where a lot of the confusing thoughts with bisexuality stem from. 
111,5 years in the Navy. Get fucked.
112,"You are really surprised to hear that a story about a straight man having sex is fake?  I think most sex stories on here are fake - people do it because this sub is mostly impressionable tweens who haven't had sex and want to fulfill their fantasy - its easy karma.  Straight men having gay sex is a step below the ""I sucked off my cousin at a family event"" thread that we had a couple of weeks back too.

I will never understand the obsession with straight guys.  There are masculine gay men who are 100% straight passing - as in you would never guess they were gay based on how they act even if at gay events and seeing ""gayish"" brands like Calvin Klein on them who look much better than straight guys and are actually into your group sexually.   Straight men are overrated and unnecessary."
113,Stupid governments and their borders. As someone living in one of those legal countries I wish we could let everyone live here :(
114,That‚Äôs the joke
115,"Chechnya has a population of 1.5 million, meaning it accounts for roughly .0002% of the global population. On top of that, to use this sub you need to have a pretty solid grasp of English, and according to wiki travel, ‚ÄúEnglish on the other hand is spoken by almost nobody [in Chechnya], even in the capital.‚Äù

That‚Äôs a long-winded, overly-researched way of saying there‚Äôs almost definitely no Chechnyans who will ever see this. Nice sentiment though."
116,Fight corporate control of the internet. Just use your internet browser. 
117,"
Your entire sexual orientation is ""weird"" and you're hated by the majority of people for it, so you're not in a position to judge others for unusual preferences unless they involve committing a crime. In this case, 18 is universally known to be the age when someone becomes an adult, so for another adult to have sex with him is perfectly fine. "
118,What‚Äôs the most surprising thing you‚Äôve witnessed?
119,"The kind of lifestyle where you‚Äôre renting a $3000-4000/mo apartment without it being difficult on your monthly budget. 

The kind of lifestyle where you drop $10k on an annual vacation a couple times a year. 

The kind of lifestyle where you spent $250 on dinner for two without thinking twice about it, and do it multiple times a month. 

The kind of lifestyle where you do all of the above things, and you‚Äôre living within your means, and you‚Äôre also saving adequately for retirement and long term goals. 

It absolutely sucks to realize you won‚Äôt reach a certain level of financial wealth, and that some people can, and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it. 

Most people can‚Äôt plan a life around making $300K+.  Doctors can. 

Also, keep in mind that construction work, while great money when you‚Äôre young, will have relatively few opportunities for salary growth without a spirit of entrepreneurialism. 

I‚Äôve definitely been seeing guys who were smoking hot who did things like skip class or call out of work because they didn‚Äôt feel like going, or who didn‚Äôt plan for their future. Unfortunately those kinds of things indicated to me that they were not life partner material for me, and so I did not pursue dating them, even while I enjoyed spending time with them and fucking them. "
120,"What I hate most of stories similar to this that get popular once a month or so is that how demanding the gay person is portrayed to make the ""straight"" guy fall for him. Like in this story, Pete kept flirting even though his friend at first already said no. That's not how sexuality works. You can't convince anyone to change team just like that.

The story is also full of stereotypical gay and straight people. But kudos to OP if it's true. Love is love after all. "
121,"No they aren't.  Read the fucking article.  It clearly states that someone who has fully transitioned for 3 years, or someone who isn't transitioning and has a gender dysphoria diagnosis, are fully allowed to be in the military.

Someone who is currently in the process of transitioning is not."
122,"Don‚Äôt be sorry, you‚Äôre right on the money."
123,Thanks from Ghana :)
124,"Well, ex #1 married ex #2. They're probably doing each other. "
125,"Yeah, I wasn't really ""offended"" as in angry, but a little annoyed though amused at the same time.

Had it not happened in broad daylight and among a large crowd, though, I would've probably been more worried by the stares than anything else."
126,"Those are exactly the arguments conservatives made when don't ask don't tell was introduced, and when it was repealed. "

130,I can't speak to the degradation stuff because I'm not into that. But I like being dominated because it feels good to me and I like when guys take control. I'm a pretty passive person overall (it's not always the healthiest thing and I am trying to temper that part of myself) so I always appreciate when someone takes the lead.
131,"And then when you bring it up it's one of two parroted responses:

140,"I personally think going to the movies on a first date is a bad idea. The main point of a date, especially a first date, is to learn about one another. It's extremely hard to do that when you're forced to sit next to one another in complete silence for 2+ hours. 

I would suggest grabbing lunch/dinner for a first date instead of a movie. It gives you a chance to talk in a casual setting and learn about one another. "
141,"Yes, exactly that!

145,"What about trans people who haven't transitioned ? They are banned too then. 

Also, the ""social experiment"" line was used to argue against gays and also minorities serving in the military. "
146,"Rimming is usually an acceptable substitute as a one-off, but to ignore his cock completely gives off vibes of ""I'm not really gay, bro"" which I find to be a massive turnoff.  The good news is that there's a significant minority of bottoms who *like* that sort of character so if you have a decent ""package"" of face/body/dick you can be as no-homo as you want.  "

150,They're mentally unfit to be in the military. I wouldn't give someone who's delusional a gun  
151,"But not every trans person has other mental issues... The trans people with other mental issues shouldn't serve then. It's not gender dysphoria that prevents them from performing their best, it's the other mental issues they've been diagnosed with. So why is everyone diagnosed with gender dysphoria banned if it isn't the cause? Its the other mental disorders that cause them to underperform. There are perfectly healthy trans people who aren't depressed, and have no other mental diagnoses and now they can't serve because they generalized a whole group.

They should prevent trans people with other mental issues from serving, not all trans people."
152,"Ugh. Congrats? I have mixed feelings on this story. Sure its awesome that you are exploring who you are. Good deal. But im really disturbed with your friends persistent and trying to get you to be with him. Its a little bit unhealthy for him. 

I mean i wish you the best. And hopefully he can be a little less rapey going forward?"
153,"I mean, from my perspective this sounds like pretty textbook inappropriate behavior for a manager. It‚Äôs one thing for your manager to ask you to go fishing or your personal life after a while of working for them, but what is truly a red flag here is the constant shoulder touching- he‚Äôs definitely not allowed to do that. 

Now, while I would probs take this to HR, you sound like you‚Äôre in the camp of handling it yourself. If you are just too unsure about his intentions, I would address the shoulder touching to him. If he attempts to do it to you, I would take his hand off and clearly ask him to not touch your shoulder. If you establish that it makes your uncomfortable, then he should get the hint and back off."

185,"I was 19 just a couple months ago and I don't think dating someone in their late 20s would have been weird. I don't think very serious dating would have been ideal, more like, casual dating maybe? I would find it weird to have been taken to meet the parents of someone who is 10 years older than me for example, because I'll be seen as a kid he's taking care of (and fucking).

Plus I look 16 so no guy over 20 who doesn't have a thing for boyish guys will date me"
186,"Same here, i was with a couple friends(kinda homophobic) at Macdonalds in the airport.

190,Czech Republic for sure.
191,"My first serious crush was my high school roommate. Nice guy, athletic body, very good in math. He always shared his food with me without asking me to share mine. I used to pretend to ""accidentally"" fall asleep on his bed. He never woke me up when he got back, instead he was trying not to make noise. It was really sweet. But when we met again a few years after graduation he turned into a chubby guy with messy hair, and he was telling dirty jokes and kept complaining about life. I still don't know what changed him.

As it is important that both of you get feel like you're getting your needs met, now maybe the time to reevaluate the relationship.

Maintain the status quo

Compromise (less sex for you, more sex for him)

End the relationship (maybe you're better as friends)

Transform the relationship (example a romantic but nonsexual relationship)

I tend to want to get to know the person that I'm serious about without focusing on my dick. And I think having sex with other people when you're into someone is just not healthy. 

Then again, I'm an old-school style millennial that believes in absolute monogamy.  And sex is about 40% of my relationship characteristic. "

211,"It's not a cure all you're right, but this law isn't banning those people; it bans *all* trans people regardless of mental health.  It also bans people from becoming trans while in the military, essentially forcing them to choose between gender dysphoria or forced discharge.

Let's not pretend that the American military gives this level of scrutiny to the mental health of any of its other soldiers.  Some of the problems with PTSD etc that people suffer are insane and they continue to serve. "

216,"I would add up that for trans people that up until recently the medical profession has had a hugely negative effect on the mental health of this community. Like having to undergo ‚ÄòReal Life Experience‚Äô in order to be allowed to transition., or being denied because the person isn‚Äôt wearing the right clothes, or isn‚Äôt masculine / feminine enough. Gatekeeping access to hormones so people end up self medicating. Lack of financial help so people sacrifice building a home, having holidays, buying normal things enjoyed by regular people so they can pay for meds, doctors, treatments and surgeries. People still turn to sex work and porn for money because not only are things expensive but access to employment is usually diminished.  

The list goes on and as a whole these things are likely to have an impact on mental health and outcomes like suicide, self harm and substance abuse are unsurprisingly high. Things are changing. But really only in the last few years.

220,"At no point did you describe yourself doing anything wrong.

Nothing you did was wrong.

Some older dudes perved out on you. Still, nothing you did was wrong.

The worst thing you did was lie to your parents. Which is bad, yes. But to be fair they deserved it. They really really really deserved it.

Because no part of your youthful sexual curiosity towards boys was dirty or bad. But your parents really truly believed it is.

You dodged a bullet though. People in your parents religion used to beat the fucking shit out people for writing with their left hand less than 100 years ago.

This planet is filled with people willing to murder each other over the differences in their stories about what happens when you die.

Most humans used to believe the earth is flat. The Abrahamic religions used to make women go sit alone for a week during menstruation..... I mean, come on.

Homosexuality is observed in every single animal group on this planet. Homophobia exists in only one. And your parents had a lot of it.

It is time to consciously choose what you believe in and the thoughts you entertain within your mind. It's called psychoanalyzing and it is important for most lgbt people to reassess their identities. Our childhoods are filled with unearned guilt brought on by people who insist in believing in magic but not logic and observation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing you did was inappropriate, shameful or gross. You enjoyed your body while looking at images that excited you. And your partners in this were often older than is legal, but that is on them and not you.

It's time to put down all that shame and guilt and embarrassment. None of the things you feel are gross. They are wonderful and hundred of millions of other people feel exactly the same.

Good luck."

You can have all the skills and personality you want and most guys do not care one single bit. He saw me for me and it was refreshing as fuck.  "
222,"He texted me constantly, sometimes texting me 7 times in a row with no response yet still not getting the hint. I ghosted him for a while but he still didn't stop, so I finally just told him I wasn't looking for anything at the moment."
223,always makes me laugh 
224,"Sure thing. But does the military do psych profiles on applicants or recruits? If so, that's the time to ask about and catch it. If not, I guess it's probably not that important. 

It's possible that they determined a long time ago that the way to handle that for enlisted soldiers is to just wait for it to be a detectable problem for an individual, and proceed from there "
225,"My approach is to give it away ... kisses, love, support, massages, affection .... be the loving partner to him you hope he can be to you.  It doesn‚Äôt always work out that way, but if you keep loving him usually it lights a flame you both share.  This is love, that moment when you realize you both share something bigger than yourselves.  Its so huge and overwhelming you don‚Äôt even need to talk about it.  

Also ... the honeymoon phase will end, it always does.  Try never to take him for granted but to fall in love with his strengths and bis flaws.  And they say a persons flaws are what we fall in love with.  I hope you have a great relationship, never forget to get love you must give it first.  "
226,What you say is true but expect to to downvoted in mass on this subreddit.
227,"I wish more straight guys knew that you can be bros with a gay dude. We‚Äôre not all feminine, and even those that are can still be your bro (if they want to). It can be very beneficial to have a gay bro? Need examples? When your girl is frustrated that you don‚Äôt fuck her right, she complains to me and tells me how she wants to be fucked. If I‚Äôm your bro, I‚Äôll tell you exactly what she wants from you, and then you‚Äôre the fuck of the year all of a sudden. Don‚Äôt know what to get your girl for your anniversary? Your gay bro knows her better than you ever will, as me. Single? Your gay bro knows lots of single girls, he can hook you up. Girls tend to like guys that aren‚Äôt homophobic so that‚Äôs one thing going for you already.  

I have a few straight bros and we‚Äôre really good friends. It‚Äôs a wholesome thing to have a good friendship/be bros with straight and gay guys. At the end of the day, I appreciate a nice ass just as much as you do. You just have to listen to me talk about dick too from time to time. 

I also wish more straight guys knew how to treat women, because if I see you disrespecting a woman in the club, I **will** intervene."

232,"I know i'll get downvoted for this but I dont think he's in the wrong regarding expressing his preferences. Everyone desires different characteristics in a partner whether that be appearance / financial stability / personality ... 

Sure the wrong thing he did was that he gave you the idea that you had a future together then reject you and he is in the wrong for doing that. Other than that, I think financial means is a perfectly acceptable characteristic to look for in a partner ...

234,"If you don't have borders, you don't have a country. If you don't have a country, you don't have law and order. If you don't have law and order, then you don't have any way to protect LGBT people from hate and discrimination. 

Countries should by all means be more welcoming to LGBT people living in oppressive places. But the border is a necessary part in fostering and maintaining a safe place for gay people. "
235,"Did you just assume that your definition of ‚Äúugly‚Äù is somehow universal? And that everyone is going for a specific ‚Äúhandsome‚Äù look? Hate to break it to you, but no.

240,"Dating and being in a relationship are two different things. Dating is to get to know someone, to see if you want to be in a relationship with them.

252,Thanks from Bulgaria. I know it will never get better for me but it's at least some consolation that there are places in the world where people like me can be openly themselves.

262,I dated my first boyfriend a little over a year and fought constantly so we broke up. My second ex and I were together for 6 months when ex #1 came back into the picture briefly as a friend. They met once and began talking to each other behind my back until ex #2 left me for ex #1. And here I am 3 years later. I only know they were married from the wedding invitation they sent me last year....
263,Exist
264,"I‚Äôve been in this exact same situation before, and mine was much more toxic. I chased after him endlessly because the sex was so good, and whenever we were together, he treated me like I was his and he was mine. But by the end of the day, it was as if our connection wasn‚Äôt real, to him at least. He‚Äôd refer to 

And now that I‚Äôm older and wiser, I finally understood it now: he was just in it for the sex. Nothing more. 

At some point, I deluded myself into thinking that his feelings will change in time. Mind you, I was 21  and he was in his late 30s. I was attracted to the idea that a grown man of his caliber (and omfg, a bangin‚Äô body and huge cock) was interested in someone like me, when in reality, I was just a fuck buddy that he could treat as a friend at his convenience. But nothing more, like I said. I treated him like a king. 

I eventually ended everything on Facebook chat and we had a back and forth argument about it over me being young. Ultimately, I said that I needed to let him go, heal and learn to love myself again because at that age, I felt like I could sacrifice everything for him. He accepted, but was disappointed because he felt that I was a good friend to him and that the age difference between us was too much for him in terms of dating. 

Months had gone by, and I was finally in a happy place - after ugly crying the misery out.  He messages me out of nowhere. I‚Äôd be bullshitting if I said it didn‚Äôt illicit any sexual excitement or romantic flashbacks, but it did. I kept the conversation casual, told him I was doing great and focusing my time on work mostly and spending time with family and friends. He said he was ready to date ‚Äî me. By this time, I fought long and hard for the younger me who had to cry those tears because he made me feel like I wasn‚Äôt  good enough, and told him rightfully so. Told him I was finally in a happy place (I really was) and was seeing someone new (I wasn‚Äôt)

We remained friends even after that Facebook conversation, but no in-person meeting even after his several attempts in trying to meet up with me. 

More time had gone by (months) and I eventually  learned from his former best friend and roommate that he was in hospice care due to complications of AIDS, and where he eventually died. I had a health scare that time as well because I thought I was somehow infected. But if I had to guess, after learning the heartbreak that I had gone through for him, and only for him to realize that it was too late by the time he was ‚Äúready‚Äù ‚Äî he punished himself by sleeping around. 

I would never wish the unfortunate situation he was in on anyone because we‚Äôre all just trying to make it through in this life. I sure as hell miss who he was before all the toxicity and destruction happened. 

Sorry for the rant, OP. But piece of advice from someone who has gone through this:

- Cut off all means of communication 
- Focus on things that make you happy whether that‚Äôs working, playing video games, spending time with friends/family. 
- You are more than enough and you deserve someone who‚Äôll make you happy and accept you as you are. "

I may not have a PhD, or a MD/DO, but what I do got is no student loans, a job that pays really damn well, and the last thing I would do is hitch my wagon to your debt ridden star.  

And believe me; that 300k a year doc position...unless you‚Äôre in a very significant speciality field..you‚Äôll be making about as much as a new grad nurse, and will be in that area for a few years until you get yourself built up.

I might just wait until the natural point where I'd be introducing Pete to my friends/family if it were a straight relationship and then just do that without some big ""I'm gay"" announcement.  This is who I'm in love with and who I'm dating, and I suppose that's all anyone has to worry about.  "
