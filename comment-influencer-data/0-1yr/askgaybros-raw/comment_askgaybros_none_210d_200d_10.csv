1,"The percentage is just hyperbole, but I kind of see what you mean. The point though is that there is a necessary self-identification component. Bisexuals aren’t all the same in terms of romantic and/or sexual attraction to different genders, and that the OP is “still bi” despite feeling unequal attractions to men and women. "

The guy being blown? Yeah, that's me. "
3,This. Sounds like a closet case. 
4,Great show!!! 
5,I’ll review this later lol. 
6, Fuck him. Liars like him make it more likely people won't believe us when we try to talk about actual bigotry we face.
7,"No it is definitely uncommon for people to impose homosexuality on others. normally, most who suspect someone is gay, don't feel comfortable or even know how to ask because it is such a jarring question so they usually wait or give subtle signs of gay acceptance so that person feels safe to express themselves, if they happen to be gay.

9,"UUAAANANNNNGHHHH

OOOOOOAAAAAHHHHHHH

UUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAHNNNNNN

bruh no just stop"
10,u right. just frustrating nonetheless
11,"Soothe your bosoms, bruh"
12,"I get that. I feel pretty comfortable with the phrase ""functionally gay"". I myself enjoy companionship with women and find many of them pretty. But I'm not really into PIV hetero sex. Sure I could probably find a woman here and there that I find sexually arousing, but those women would have to be really good looking. That's not a good place to be in, especially for long term relationships - people will age and you can't expect your partner to always be fully groomed and flawless for you to get it on. In that sense, it's just safer for me to date men so that my attraction to my partner doesn't fade over time."
13,"He gave you a low blow by calling you a fag.

You gave him a low blow by calling him a virgin."
14,"Its just a week, calm down"
15,"You telling this made me realize how I have been thinking countless times about coming out and been playing out the way people might react or respond in my head. Now that reality hits, it's not all that bad and I think I'm just sceptical, because this is not really what I expected in my head.   


I haven't told my dad yet so might still get disowned lol."
16,My preference is short. One isn't better than the other 
17,I never said it would be an insanity plea. It would likely be a petition to the court for him to get mental health treatment for a lighter sentence. I worked in criminal court and my guess is he will get off pretty light.
18,"I've done the [Atlantis](http://atlantisevents.com/) Caribbean cruise once and going on the Asia one in April. There were 3,000 guys and 30 women on our last ship. I honestly thought I would hate it since I'm not really a scene queen but it was a ton of fun. I feel like the average age was \~30, but with so many guys you can easily find people of all ages, types, races, etc. Atlantis is notorious for being a party cruise (i.e. multiple themed dance parties each day), so even when the age skews older, it still feels young. There are lots of single guys that come alone on the cruise and they love it. Sex, friends and companionship are easy to find if you're looking for that.  "
19,"That’s a great idea, I will try sitting next to him and ask a couple questions during lecture. Keeping my cool."
20,"Thanks for the advice, I feel like adding him would be kind of stalker-y, no? Like he would be confused on how I even know his name. If I can get a friendship from this I’d be satisfied :)"
21,"I might ask him, I've never seen him take any meds"
22,"hey

hey

sup

                                        Nothing much, how are you doing?

good n u?"
23,"Sis, you dodged a bullet. He sounds weird as fuck.."
24,This is your problem not his. I wouldn’t date anyone that didn’t have friends so maybe you should consider yourself lucky. 
25,"You have to be really skilled, and even more patient, to make me cum from a bj alone. "
26,Haha. Are you waiting for a better time and place to come out then? Or you think you'll avoid labeling yourself ?
27,Bussy Wallet
28,"I agree. It's surprisingly easy for the body to cheat and work around weak glutes unless you specifically target them. When I started isolating them, I found I was out of balance, too, with one side weaker than the other. 

TBH, the women at the gym know what makes butts look good. Many of them do cable kickbacks, which you almost never see a guy doing. "
29,Hahah it is just a funny word to me i didn’t grew up in a widely English speaking country and I recently heard that word and it was just so funny to me 
30,Worst part is I was 18 at the time. Yeah I think it’s fine to have that uninhibited spirit... just not in a bar. Like do that at an event specifically for that.
31,"Aw thats so cute. Well here, al lot of gay guys are obsessed with disneyland. Its kinda strange to me. Idc if you love Disney, its just that this guy took it a little extreme"
32,Vodka with diet tonic and lemon. Love fruit and cheese.
33,Well it could only ruin her life if she could actually be charged and convicted for it which would be ludicrous and also open up thousands of lawsuits from the numerous instances it's happened (especially online).
34,Confront him about what? Look you may think he's led you on because you truly hoped he was interested but that doesn't mean he or others are gonna see it the same way. If you confront him about it you will gain nothing from it. He's not gonna change his mind and hang out if you get hostile or accuse him of something. So let him figure his shit out while you continue trying to move on and then move on. 
35,The dude is clueless as always.
36,Haha same. Except one of these guys i also work with and now we are friends. At first he was annoyed how many people would mention it but since becoming friends its become like a game to tease other people with. I’m gay and he is straight so we aren’t really competing for the same attention either.
37,"It's pretty common now. Especially on weekends in major city gay bars. In West Hollywood the biggest gay bar (The Abbey) is probably close to half straight. A lot of those straight guys are really hot... some even twinky and a bit fem, so it gets confusing! "
38,"Don't be so concerned with becoming some kind of expert, you don't need to be. Everyone is inexperienced when they start out.

Go out and meet people, get to know people you are interested in. Socialize and network with people in your area. I know it's hard when you're awkward, but maybe start out with something you're interested in. Like sports or video games or whatever.

When you meet the right guy, just let him know you're inexperienced. Most people are understanding of that, we've all been there. Don't feel like you have to try so hard..."
39,"Why? If you're not emotionally invested enough to stick through cancer, and you know it, why is it better to string them along first? And sincere when has moving in been the stage where you agree to stay together through debilitating life altering illnesses?"
40,Sure!
41,"He was looking for a relationship, he told me that first he wanted us to be friends and then after some time see if we can have a relationship, he even told me that if I wanted to have sex then to swipe to the next guy, I told him I was sure I was not into hook ups and then, the day of the date he asked me to go to his car, also I ended the date, I told him I had to go (It was getting late) and we said goodbye with a hug"
42,"Let me make a slightly different response...

GET TO WORK AND DEDICATE YOURSELF. Yes, you are just 19, but this is the time to begin working on yourself to shape the rest of your life. Don’t discount these years as worthless or only for fun/crazy times. I highly recommend setting your mind on a few companies you would love to work for and zoning in on going to work for them somehow/someway. When you get a foot in the door STAY WITH THAT COMPANY. I work for a large company now and am in my early 30s. 
If I had started with them when I was your age I would be making lots more money at this point and would have so many extras! 

A lot of people think 19,20,21,22 is all about playing around and being silly and carefree. I urge you so very much to get obsessed with work and career starting right now.
That is one big way you will build a meaningful existence. You will also be able to build and begin to make money that will allow you to go fun places and do wonderful things with your life.

:)"
43,Most likely the prep clinic gave you a false negative. 
44,Maybe he just stayed the night?
45,Btw I went through your profile what does atx mean if you don't mind me asking?
46,And hold pple who do fake crimes accountable. Smollet case took away media attention that could have gone 2 that gay couple in Austin and that's the really sad part
47,Don't be so hard on yourself! Everyone has a type. I guarantee you right now that there are whole seas of people who would be into you! 
48,Yes... we do KNOW these things dude.  There are no presumptions here.  I certainly have read a fair bit of his work lol... among the work of others.  It is all widely available.  I say... we just agree to disagree.  You don't seem to understand the way academic research actually works.  I'm guessing most of your knowledge of Kinsey comes from the movie? haha.  
49,Has to be mostly the same as mine or it's a deal breaker. 
50,yes! Why don't more people like guys that look normal?
51,I feel you. I wish my dick was smaller and I wasn't so handsome. 
52,"When I heard about this I knew it was bullshit. First off, Obama directly interfered with anti gay laws in countries like uganda and never once made an announcement of this magnitude. If we couldn’t barely deter countries like Uganda, how are we going to be the world police?

Also, like what? Trump has never cared about gay people, and actively works against trans people. You’re telling me that the president with a VP who pushes for legal conversion therapy is on the crusade for worldwide hay rights? There’s no way."
53,It's chill. I like high maintenance
54,"I felt like that for a while after coming out too. Truth is, we think about sexuality as a much bigger part of life (since we actually have to deal with it) than straight people do. They also have no experience of LGBT socializing. It really is what it is. I'd just lower my expectations and talk about it the same way straight people talk about it (I.e. not as a thing in and of itself, but about partners and dating in general). Eventually you'll get used to being completely unremarkable in other people's eyes lol"
55,"The classic coming out disappointment.

You expect your whole life to change and become better after coming out and revealing your true self but in reality everything stays the exact same way that it was. Pretty anticlimactic. Well, at least it's better than getting disowned or stoned to death"
56,This sub.
57,"Do i actually need to recite the fucking title of your goddamn post back to you.  


Jesus fucking christ dude."
58,You don't have to want to. It's more about not closing yourself off if you do meet someone else.
59,Lol my parents don't have to protect me in their work place. I decided to come out to most of my family and they protected me in that respect but out and about I choose who I tell when I think they should know. Their coworkers don't need to know I'm gay so they don't have to dance around these subjects. I'm just their son. 
60,"He’ll probably take a plea for a reduced sentence, no? "
61,"This story and act by Jussie is the same as the Dems attack on Trump over Russian collusion. The thing that is different is that Jussie got caught and Trump has been under investigating for years over this Russia bs and still no conclusive information damning Trump has come out. I'm a Trump supporter and I'm gay. Jussie just trashed gays names and Trump is sitting in the white house with people trying to impeach him on false grounds.

I guess this is kind of a Yin Yang happening of our time.

What I don't understand is why our gov is ok with spending billions on a investigation that has had no outcomes, execpt for people who worked in their own interests that didn't relate back to Trump at all. 

The MAGA posts are most likely for justice. Republicans don't like most Actors because they act like they're better than everyone else (they also trash Trump every day) and think they know what's right for normal everyday people when they're millionaires and don't know what working pay check to pay check is. You have to remember before all this political bs was blasted all over the news and all these actors were overly supporting candidates publicly people just watched movies, fashion, and public events and politics weren't a part of it. Also on this not Jussie directly linked Trump supporters to this attack. He's just a trashy piece of shit now and it shouldn't really matter what side your on at this point.

62,This is why i ask for an address. Im not meeting a guy if i cant tell someone where i am let alone me not knowing where i am going. Or if i get vague instructions. 
63,"Ignore him, OP literally posted a pic of his dick on Reddit, and regularly posts selfies with information about himself, and then claims other people are seeking attention. He's just here to stir up drama. "
64,Personally doubt he will serve any time.  He seems to be friends with several politicians.  Celebrities and politicians can get away with a lot.
65,Thats what OP does mean! Whats the gay equivalent? 
66,"The ""girl"" has probably been given him shit about how ""gay"" your friendship sounds.

It's a classic abusive partner move to isolate the target by manipulating him to cut the tires in their life.

- It might be a gay guy.
- It could be a cult move.
- There is maybe a financial scam afoot.
- She might just be a beaoch.
- He also might have coincidentally stumbled into some sort of internet poison that has nothing to do with her.

He sounds emotionally vulnerable and someone toxic has found him and started whispering in his ear.

I'd just say, as kindly and genuinely as you can, that once he figures out that he's being poisoned you'll be around.

Don't let yourself feel cut down, but do service your own self worth by not letting his situation garden you in response.

Friends, even and especially casual friends, go through tough patches. You can't help them most of the time but you can tell them that you'll help break their fall when they are ready.

As long as you don't betray yourself with their damage you'll be able to stay clean."
67,"I’m neither conservative nor liberal (Sometimes I vote republican, other times democrat, sometimes both in the same election). As such, I can see the corruption and lying from both parties, neither of which is innocent."
68,"Be a man and come out to them. Most young people are just repeating what they hear from their parents. Once they meet a real gay person in real life and realize that we're just people too, they change their tune "
69,"I always found it funnier that, after I came out, they still wouldn’t let me sleep over at a girl’s house or a girl at mine but it was fine if my guy friends spent the night sharing my bed. It absolutely enraged my sister as being so unfair. "
70,It seems like you didn't like him that much to begin with so why do you even care ? Stop crying and waste your time on something else.
71,"I can't read this post because OP had terrible grammar in the title.

It should be: Does poor grammar turn off anyone else?"
72,"Staying at his place isn’t a good idea, you don’t know yet what kind of in-person chemistry you guys have which is a lot different than chat chemistry. 

I’ve done exactly this a couple times and always make sure to stay in a hotel. It’s actually not so much about safety as it is about creating a more neutral environment to get to know each other, rather you being under his roof and there possibly being an automatic expectation of sex because of it."

74,Would you be alright with your parents crashing at your place and having sex there? Proceed accordingly. 
75,People with small penis can be masculine nani ? What are you talking about sir lol jk 
76,"Yes you’re crazy. It’s healthy to have friends and some space to do things outside of a relationship. Stop being so clingy or he’s gonna run away from you, as he should."

78,Mild autism can actually manifest into higher intelligence in very rare cases. I saw a report somewhere mentioning that 90% of CEO’s exhibit mild social symptoms of Autism.
79,"For overall muscle, definitely, but for ass specifically, I'd still encourage isolation. Compound exercises also run the risk of other muscle groups taking over if one is weak. At least anecdotally speaking, my butt went from just okay to pretty good (if I can say so myself) only when I added hip thrusts and glute kickbacks to my routine"
80,"I've gone with friends to gay bars... two or three times? If there were lesbians there it wasn't obvious. From what I'm told from gay friends gay bars tend to be pretty much all dudes, even just walking down the street in the middle of the day it's like 90% dudes. I'd imagine there are some bars that cater specifically to lesbians."
81,"I agree, I went straight to the ""it's the heteros fault"" 
But this also give you a thought"
82,"I have a friend like that, he doesn't call me a fag or anything but he says mean things to me and my other friend sometimes cause i guess he feels bad about not having anyone to be with while me and my friend at least had some previous experiences.

84,You won't wear a shirt and you'll cry
85,"Idk. At the end of the day, you're the only one who knows yourself best. However, having goals and caring about friends enough for it to matter aren't mutually exclusive Imho ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
86,"Right? Don’t be petty, it’s a bad look. He sucks because he treated you, his friend, like shit. Not because he’s a virgin nerd. That’s his own business"
87,After I read all these grinder hookup posts I feel insanely lucky to be in a healthy long term relationship. I go find my chubby bottom and nearly suck his face off and he has no idea why.

93,"If it’s a Mardi Gras party wear a Mardi Gras mask.

96,Kudos for self awareness 
97,"Yep; embrace the twinkiness now because by 30, most people will turn away the toxic behavior unless OP is rich. "
98,In cases like this you'll wonder about that loser's insecurity about their own sexuality. 
99,Okay he sounds crazy.
100,Tbh I still have no idea whether I'm homosexual biromantic or just homosexual
101,I don't get fisted but my buddy loves it and he's never had that problem. 
102,You lost me when you said “Anthem”. Smh 
103,"but you're not taking advantage of him, no sir."
104,Here’s your salad. 😁
105,The real crime here
106,"This guy is probably dealing with some deep personal issues. It seems like he's lashing out at you for no reason. That's usually a red flag.

I wouldn't take it personally (I know it's easy for me, a stranger, to say). I had a similar problem with a friend. I'm Bi and he knew for years before he lashed out. Then, all of a sudden it was an issue. Eventually we found out he was struggling with some pretty intense problems.

It's not weak or a sign of weakness (or even self loathing) to support a friend that is attacking you.

If you care about him as a friend then it might be best to step back and give him space but don't respond in anger or do anything to hurt a potential future reconciliation.

Truth eventually comes out and, in time, you may find that this guy is attacking you from a position of pain.

If he's young then he's still finding himself and learning from life experiences.

I know the overwhelming impulse to respond in kind when attacked but, if the friendship matters to you then you may have to be the bigger man.
If it doesn't matter, then proceed accordingly.

Only you know if it's worth saving, for you.

107,definitely stealing this
108,"He invited me to a movies and it was a mess, I felt like I was on the way I had to disappear many times because even though he was talking to me and everything I just couldn't stand feeling like I was in the way"
109,"Yes, and I’m attracted to many moods of guys. Usually cute lean guys also have incredible bodies. I’m more stocky, but lean guys attract me more "
110,"At the end of the day, you don’t know if the person that you are talking to has a road block that they need to overcome all day every day, eg: dyslexia 

I have it and it’s a struggle, it does not mean I’m not intelligent or uneducated, it just means I’m wired differently.

I know when I’m tired/stressed and a million other things, I have days/moments where I can’t spell or grammar is nonexistent.

I do try my best but sometimes everything is telling me I’ve spelt it correctly or grammar is correct, but it’s not.

I’ve tried to get my head around your you’re and I think there is another one (NFI) same with there their how ever the other one is spelt, it just doesn’t stick.

So a lot of the time I shorten words like u or ur and 9 times out of 10 I don’t even notice that I’ve done it.

Like I said we are all wired differently. 🙂"
111,I'm glad you did share. That was an impressive read. I bet the doorknob race was hilarious to watch. I like you!

115,"Wait, you're not the same person?"
116,"You can get a good sense for how other people dance when they’re really feeling the music. Check out Boiler Room on YouTube. 

I like to dance to the beat of the music by moving my feet to it (hitting the floor). It feels so much nicer. Certain genres are more conducive for this. House and Techno’s 4x4 beat and repetitive structure easily give off hints as to where the track is going and allows you to accurately predict and move your feet and body to them. This is why clubs like to remix pop songs with House, Tech House beats, etc."
117,She dosent care at all. She is quite socially liberal. 
118,Oh then that would be a deal breaker for sure. I’m fine with policy disagreements but treating someone negatively based on those opinions is out of the question for me.

132, Someone may have reminded him that he's playing vgames with a gay man and maybe he doesn't like the idea people could talk. Maybe he's gay. 
133,"I actually had a best friend, and I mean a literal best friend, that did a 180 because he couldn't handle his machismo ego being checked on top of having problems at home and worrying about his future. He was being stretched thin and I got the short end of the stick after 4 years. 

It hurt, took a year really to be over it because I was so blind sided. He would ask questions, joke around, try to really understand better. Never knew he still had trouble mentally reminding himself that homosexuality was ok because he was doing a great job acting like it was ok to him. 

We can only better ourselves as our environment allows us. If he didnt have to go home and deal with his parents fighting and getting a divorce. Or worrying about somehow improving his career with his lab tech job. Or learning how to manage his first relationship ever. It would have been different.

If you want to be around people like that, and don't  want to make an effort to make new friends then that's fine that's up to you. That leaves you with a few options. Call them out on their BS, or you can just put up with listening to the BS until you can't deal with it anymore. "

If you learn steps from youtube, next time youre at the club youll be focusing on the steps instead of focusing on the music and enjoying it. 

I went out on a date with this guy, and he told me, oh Im known in town for my dancing. We went to a club after and he started dancing to this moves you could tell he had rehearsed a million times, and he had a whole routine and every step down packed and choreographed. It was really embarrassing for me and everyone around him to see him trying so hard. Would a million times rather dance with a goofy dancer who's just enjoying the music and letting it all go.

&amp;#x200B;"
162,"&gt; not even hard!

Fuck you for complaining about this. Not every bottom gets hard from anal sex, and sometimes the most comfortable positions make it very difficult to maintain an erection."
163,"&gt;I fail

you could've stopped there, sweetie"
164,"Exactly, this has been pissing me off and turns me off. Some people have good communication skills but the fact that they type in ""short hand"" is just wrong.

One time, I tried to call out someone on that and he said ""why do I care about something so shallow?"""
165,"I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

166,"The ""girl"" will probably turn it to be some older guy who never leaves his basement."
167,"well i am not interested in both of them, but you can date whoever you like."
168,"I can write properly, but do I bother doing it at like Grindr? No, and if the dude is a prude. Guess I dodged a bullet.

Honestly, being a prejudice cunt because of something like that. That scream low intelligence to me at least."
169,"So my boyfriend’s dad is bald, which has made me entertain the high probably that my boyfriend will be bald that day...thot about it for 2 seconds, decided I love him either way, and carried on with my day. 

Don’t worry about it good sir "
170,"Sounds like you don't have many other options for friends anyway, hence the need to secretly bitch and moan online about someone you thought so poorly of before, yet still hung around them.

You are fag, that homophobic prick was right about something.."
171,Hairpieces look worse.  They call them a rug for a reason.  
172,"Thank you very much, ive been rethinking this over and over lately, but because i have no one to talk to, i really need another perspective from the internet, right now i feel stuck and dont know what to do, and i dont have any motivation at all, kinda depressed i think"
173,"You might kiss dudes, but at least you can kiss someone lol"
174,"Boy boyfriend did this a lot when we first started dating. For all I know, he probably still does it with other people. 

But I told him very early on that I did not find that ""text speak"" cute or endearing and that it made me feel like I was talking to a 12 ywar old. It's not attractive whatsoever and does not make me want to talk to you."
175,"Meh, if he is found guilty how many years should he get?"
176,Sometimes we do things that we personally don't find sexy simply to please our partners. It part of the compromise that comes ina relationship.
177,How do you know he lied? Because the media is telling you that?
178,I’m sure it’ll only be a matter of time before they take that feature away like others that have come and gone. 
179,"Probably low key homophobic, honestly I think should should feel blessed to have that kind of silly homophobia, it could be much worse like a bunch in the fucking face or you know how they do in some places, throw gay people off rooftops. "
180,"""Yeah who wants to play games with a guy, faggot?""

""Girls are shit at videogames, why do we let those whores who only want attention into our communities?"""
181,Is your position that the US should not spend any money pursuing a diplomatic solution to ending the legal killing of gays worldwide?
182,so you'd rather be bombarded with homophobic slurs than be alone or make an effort to find new friends? enjoy your homophobia then
183,"Pretty much everyone defending it/talking about it. Even in the article, Grennell calls it new. "
184,"Whaaaaat the fuck thats cold. Well, sometimes the trash takes itself out I guess."
185,i feel the same thing 
186,"What are you talking about? Grennell has already had his first meeting about this, he even tweeted a photo of himself with some of the LGBT activists he has met with. Do you think the whole thing was made up? Do think he paid off the Lithuanian ambassador or something?"
187,"I’m gay and while I won’t say shorter men are necessarily hotter, I find myself more attracted to shorter guys. I just want someone I feel I can hold and protect"
188,You're hanging out with a loser. You're better off.
189,Maybe. I think we’ll have to agree to disagree on US intervention on the global stage. 
190,Uh....I obviously support that. I never said I don't support that. 
191,What are the bi stereotypes of 2019? 10 years ago they were just poofs in denial supposedly. 
192,I like to believe that does not include allowing atrocities to occur. Atrocities like gays being legally lynched. Atrocities that the United States may be in a position to help stop.
193,So is it fair to say you disagree with what your president stated? 
194,"I suspect that he is trying to maintain some type of heterosexual superiority image to let everyone know that he is cool, what he does and brags about is normal, and anything related to being gay is disgusting and abnormal. It’s all about him and his inflated ego. This is a result of his exposure to and emulation of toxic masculinity. Indeed, your perception about him being homophobic is spot on. In situations like this where being gay is viewed as something wrong by a hetero displaying person is pretty much homophobic, or at the least, disrespectful and abusive. You should not have to deal with it. I’d definitely tell him it’s not funny and explain why it’s inappropriate. He either accepts homosexuals at the same level he is supposed to be accepted at, or he should find new people to hang with. "
195,I'm not shocked. 
196,A lot of people have said they couldn’t tell I was gay before I told them. I can hide it pretty good if I want. 
197,"Trump has rolled back LGBTQ rights, banned trans folks from the military, and endorsed the first amendment defense act, which is discriminatory."
198,"&gt; They always saw me laughing and making jokes with my classmates but they told me that they saw right through me and thought that I was lonely because no one understood who I really was.

Wow those are some really good/perceptive teachers. Always nice to hear stories like that. "
199,*Ooh!* Pummel me with punishing blows!
200,"hit or miss, i guess he can't be fixed, huh?"
201,Sensuously waggle your fucky-butt to and fro until its evil juices spray all over the dancefloor.
202,You’re not the only one! I hate the “sup” or “yo” or “was gud” automatic delete. It’s sad you have to tell them then they wanna hit you with “hey how are you today?”
203,you are the cumshot I should have swallowed
204,"eh, i started at 17 and just accepted it. all the men in my family lose their hair early, so it didn't really bother me much.

nothing a buzzcut can't fix! "
205,"The person quoted by the OP is David Pressman, a former American diplomat who is a partner at the Boies Schiller Flexner law firm. He said that despite his contacts among groups who work on such issues, he first heard about Mr. Grenell’s undertaking from news reports.

The dude who said that ""nobody knows anything about this"" based that on the fact that he heard about the effort to decriminalize homosexuality on Twitter.

Do you think this is a genuine source?"
206,"Sounds like a really dull Mexican soap opera, complete with allegations of 'racism'. "
207,Good solution so I don't come across dickheads like you. :'))
208,"That's horrible. ;/
I wish for the best. :) &lt;3"
209,Yeah they are kinda bible bashers... They make fun of religion and homosexuality.. Kinda weird. :/
210,I didn't downvote you here and I'm not gonna downvote your past posts. I just don't agree with your opinion.
211,"Attention whoring?
How am i attention whoring? 

I don’t see how that’s in any way relevant."
212,"No, people usually don't smoke when doing sex the way they do, it's not a stereotype but a social behaviour of them (we are talking about a very defined demografics, not every black men), if a description of a social behaviour is ""racist"" for you well ok then. Stop promoting a condescending view on black people.  "
213,"I hope that guy gets cancer. 

Sorry if that offends anyone, but if a guy can just up and leave like that and chalk cancer up to drama, he’s a pos not just a jerk. 

To me there’s a level of understanding (albeit a very small one) that someone could’ve been not that committed or just not ready for that kind of news and they run off scared. But to equate cancer to drama like it’s some soap opera and he doesn’t wanna caught up in it is heartless. "
214,I don't trust this administration whatsoever. They have been caught in lie after lie. I would trust this source FAR less if they worked for the Trump administration.  I want proof when they start doing shit...that's actually useful and not just talking about it. That's when I'll say good job. This administration has been toxic for LGBT people. If they turn around great. I don't think they will. If you wanna trust a known liar all the power to you.
215,"You shouldn’t be feeling sore my dude 

That’s a sign of you not doing it right "
216,Did I say somewhere in my comment that it was right? Nope
217,"Lol. \[The Covington kids were fucking trash\]([https://www.dailydot.com/irl/covington-boys-video/](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/covington-boys-video/)), you're being manipulated just as well by thinking they were somehow the poor victims here."
218,There is something absolutely gorgeous about her to me. I'm also giggly about her husband as well...ugh. They are just a really attractive couple lol
219,"Ah dude I've got cold feet on like 4 guys that could have been perfect for me and ghosted them, but was just suffering from personal issues at the time.. feels bad man"
220,"Sadly I don’t... I’m such a coward, I’ve had my sexuality described as disgusting and broken, called a pedo for no reason, told that I need help and I need to be locked up, told that I don’t deserve love, all for being Bi... and I haven’t done anything about it "
221,Different people have different education and life skills. I do have to say it’s nice to chat with someone with a grasp of grammar. It says something about the person’s intellect.
222,"Blocked, you won't be able to bother me with your existence."
223,Well he could be? Or maybe denying? I am very mixed in this
224,"nope, since I'm already there "
225,"The issue:  straight women attend gay bars in order to avoid straight men. That’s where the misogyny is. I never wrote a word about ladies not being sllowed in gay bars, I wrote it is a problem for gsys not to have their safe haven to themselves. You find the problem solved if gays take responsibility for straight mens acting towards women.
And as far as women in gay bars on an equal basis: we do have gay women in our bars over here. They feel just as uncomfortable with having straight people in the facility as gay men. Equality doesn’t mean we sll have to do the conga all over the place, it also invludes the respect for minorities to have their own space.
So where is the misogynic aspect you’re ranting about?"
226,Most of the ones I found were serious.
227,"Wow that is pretty identical to how I feel, except for the having a straight relationship part.

I am too considering going to another counselor soon. I think i need to forget how much of a quack my previous one was and move on."
228,"I mean, looks will fade anyway. I was quite pissed off when I started losing my hair though, but quickly got over it and don’t mind being a slaphead now."
229,"‘Conservatives’ by British standards fully accept gay people as far as I can see, even elderly people.

It’s the religious people that are the problem, although saying that the Church of England is strongly encouraging acceptance or gay marriage and LGBT rights"
230,"Have a very noticeable thinning spot on the top of my head, have for 3 years and am late 20s. To the right person it won't matter, but it will always be an anxiety inducer until you come to terms. I can't say much more.. I'm still stressing about mine lol."
231,"+ Ha ha ha! Fair enough.

I'll do you one better that will make you question our sanity. Here because we are a large populated city with a long history of culture mixing. 

Everyone calls each other or others stuff like:  Sis, Son, Mami, Papa, and the ever soo controversial...Nigga. "
232,I get it but I do think it would be best to drop them and look for new friends or even spend some me time on yourself because if they’re going to talk like that and with your sexuality it’s not going to be good for you. 
233,Try being early 20's and already receding... 
234,Lol
235,"The news is full of shit.

""In an interview with NBC, Mr. Grenell sought to portray the effort as much broader. “This is not just about Iran,” he said in the interview. “This is about 71 countries, and Iran is one of them.”

“We are working with European allies on a brand-new launch to decriminalize homosexuality,’’ Mr. Grenell told NBC

Mr. Grenell told NBC that the activists, from Turkey, Ukraine, Bulgaria and other European countries, had joined him and an Iranian expatriate around a large table to discuss the effort. The ambassador said it would require “71 different strategies.”

236,Fair enough I'm from Scotland so only my friends get called bro. 
237,"+ I'm from NYC...I call my grandmother ""Bro"". "
238,Way to generalize an entire group of people.
239,+ Easyyyy! You dump them &amp; get yourself new friends.
240,"Women and gay guys love the 'bad boy' type. There is also a 'savior' motive involved. ""If only I could redeem this hot guy. Did I say hot?"" :')"
241,So it's an ideological purity test. 
242,"Well I'm married to one, have been for last 17 years."
243,"You white, young and got decent body? If so, mystery solved. That's all it takes."
244,"Lol no, I'm British .... the snark and the sarcasm are built in ...."
245,"My guess - they blame the parents as it must be the son's upbringing that made him that way. I've heard the same said of a neighbour's transexual son. And I've not been shy of telling the one expressing the view white how stupid they are.

&amp;#x200B;

Idiotic nonsense."
246,"I don't know why but I find your overuse of the word ""lad"" really annoying. 

Quite bizarre, really. "
247,central coast is a drive through area.  people from la and sf drive through and leave their tinder on. could be that
248,I did and it didn't.
249,"Why the third girl wants you even after she knows you are gay? If i knew a girl that want to volunteer as cover up, ill definitely keep her

And btw, did you approach them one by one by purpose or it happens naturally, tbh im too lazy to approach some girls right now, and im too afraid to approach some girls in my circle because it will be a scene if i we broke up, but still i just want to try"
250,"Mate, DO NOT DO THIS IF YOU ARE NOT READIED. Your whole world can be destroyed by that second you chose to come out. I chose to tell my close friend and my sister because I have a certain confidence in them not abandoning me afterwards. That being said, I only have the courage to tell them because I am strongly bonded with them. I wouldn't tell anyone else. If you do not have this level of confidence, don't do it. AND DON'T EVER EVER TAKE THE INTERNET ADVICE INTO YOUR CONSIDERATION THIS EASILY because nobody truly understands your situation, your struggle, etc. Think twice, then think twice again."
251,Kiss my ass
252,"I think. You should do what you want. Don't live for anyone else and if they push you, don't budge. Speak up. It's your future too. "
253,*Hey just noticed..* It's your **6th Cakeday** AlphatheAlpaca! ^(hug)
254,"I did though! I’m pretty vocal about when I start getting uncomfortable in a relationship. And I’m pretty clear that I just need air to breathe. I don’t feel comfortable being someone’s “everything”. That’s so much responsibility, and I’m a super fuck up so 🤷🏻‍♂️"
255,Luring them for what though 
256,You have no idea! It was literally 50 Shades of Grey. He even offered to feature me on his Onlyfans account. But I’m still on the fence since I just realized I like guys last month and I’m afraid of people finding out since I’m very masc and str8-acting :(
257,[removed]
258,Drop them
259,like the straights would ever allow that. fragile masculinity and a general sense of mockery for any one wanting a space away from them meaning it wouldnt get past the all-mens zoning board :(
260,It’s from sucking dick too hard. It restructures the facial muscles so the bottom of the eyelids are pulled back and up. So be careful out there or people will know you like playing with dick in your mouth too much
261,"Can you not sit on the towel, and when you get hard just lift up one corner to cover yourself until it goes down again?  
"
262,Haha he was more like an muscle daddy wolf-hound I guess.
263,Perhaps it had to do with the nose ring. There are lots of blood vessels there that run directly to your brain. Your nasal cavities are a breeding zone for bacteria. They might have used the weakened septum to enter your bloodstream.
264,"&gt;You: Hey, man. Are you so-and-so from Instagram?  
&gt;  
&gt;Him: Yeah...  
&gt;  
&gt;You: oh cool, you follow me too. I'm so-and-so. Nice to meet you in person!

Why is that weird?"
265,So the question OP should be really asking is: *How do I penetrate the gay community?*
266,He's a sexy stud. Some prisoner is going to be a very happy man.
267,I counteract and rebound their eyeball beams with Fantasy Mirror Pose.
268,"Exactly! Comunication... like tell me if you are enjoying. Are you close, do you usually take your time etc etc?
I try my best to manage but sometimes I fail miserably :)"
269,Try to spice up things then. There must be some key factor for you to cum ;)
270,"Bisexual man here, engaged to a woman
 That's bullshit. Your sexual preference does not in any way change your likelihood to cheat. I may check out a dude once in a while but I would never even consider being unfaithful to my soon to be wife. In fact I've honestly seen more straight people cheat than I have gay and bi people combined. "
271,Try /r/dickslips for similar content 
272,The gay men rounded up in Chechnya may have a differing view.
273,My friend who I had previously been intimate with came and visited me across the country. I assumed we would be intimate again but he insisted on sleeping on a separate bed and then went on dates with people while here. 
274,"Urkh you're that guy? 
He doesn't hate women. 
He's venting. 
He just lost a friend. 

And this sip tea shit is just.... Fuck. "
275,"Damn, you must complain about everything, then. Or you're just saying this petty shit to make yourself feel better lmao"
276,"What do you mean by ""in the worst possible way""? What are some of the things I should pay attention to? Thank you for your reply!"
277,Hahahah 
278,WYD?
279,When did the vice president tweet his support? We have a reporter tweeting that pence's office has told the reporter that pence supports it. We don't anyone in the white house actually making any statements on this as far as I know. Trump is too busy tweeting about his wall and jussie smollett
280,"Probably because it's easier, gay sex is not so socially acceptable, and you may think that it's somewhat degrading and it would ""make you gay"". If you tried it you would probably enjoy it, you're probably simply a top."

283,I heard he kidnapped a baby squirrel and threw it at a wall.
284,"This is only how you feel now. Not moving past this guy will trap you in ""love purgatory"". You won't even look at other options because in your mind this guy is the end all be all. Nobody will seem adequate because you won't even consider giving them a chance. What's worse is in the back of your mind you will always be holding on to the hope that the marriage fails and he magically comes out as gay, so you won't want to date others because then you'll be stuck in a relationship yourself. This is a huge unlikely chain of events, and I hate to say it but it probably won't ever happen. Shit sucks I know dude, but not moving on is just going to make it more difficult to accept"
285,"Oh goody, someone gets a learning experience. Most people get this out of the way in their teens, but your friend never dated so likely they are getting it out of the way now.  Let him go. It won’t work out the way he imagines it will and he’ll either be too proud to come crawling back or he will be too lonely not too.  He’s learning right now that you don’t dump on your friends at the hint of a date. This goes for gays or straights, everyone experiences the friend of convenience, hopefully people learn early from it but don’t put much effort into him. "
286,You should suck his friends’ dick to prove a point lol
287,This. So much this 
288,"Yeah the mismatch in how the sex was is a definite problem I've encountered.  I had a guy who was SOOOO into blowing me, he keeps pestering me on Grindr to come back, but...he's not that good at sucking dick, actually :("
289,"Always make an assessment of what you stand to gain and what you stand to lose or struggle with before just making an announcement. It could be a few years before anyone needs to know about your sex life, that’s your most personal information. "
290,This is a fucked up post. Why don't you have the same complaint about women since you are BI and they have smaller mouths? Made up post.
291,I'm really pissed off at him!  He gives the bigots more excuse to hate on both gay and black people and to dismiss the very real problem of escalating hate crimes here in the US and all over the world.  Not helpful at all!
292,Being petty makes me feel better. Yes.
293,"Honestly don't even go to the wedding. What do you have to gain from this, it's just going to be massively painful"
294,"I am always amazed that people care so much about someone else’s sexual self identity. Just be you.  If you’re not hurting anyone, why should I care what you like or how you do it, much less try to force you to place some label on it?  "
295,Everything he says is 100% about how he feels about himself. 
296,"I already said that I don't think the reporter lied about what he was told. You so understand the difference between the vice president tweeting something and somebody from the vice presidents office telling a reporter something, right? Because you said the vice president tweeted his support, and that's not true. "
297,"And idd, so many tops be like ""I do all the work, you shouldn't be tired"""
