0,You’re not a creep literally everyone checks people out wherever they are whether they want to admit it or not
1,"He's moved far away. Everything has changed. He is now dealing with unknown (to you) influences and circumstances. Who can say why he's acting this way (except him)? He may have gone dark to protect you, for all you know. 

Make no assumptions, plan no plans. Continue to be your good self. Continue to fulfill your hopes and dreams. Continue to live and be happy. If/when he comes back, ask him what that was all about.

What else can you do, really, except stop and wait. And what kind of life is that? Ambiguity may not be an ally, but sometimes we have to allow it to be a co-creator."
2,Only he can answer this question.
3,I am a straight woman who subs to this because I don't want to live in my own echo chamber. This is the best advice I have ever seen on Reddit.
4,"&gt;I like to look around and check out the other guys. 

This is being creepy.  Happening to notice someone walking in front of you is one thing, but actively looking around is creepy.  If you want to look at men in their underwear you have thousands of other options."
5,"Fucking in public goes beyond creepy into illegal.

Come on ffs people have some respect for others. We want people to respect us. Things like this is what helps to fuel negative stereotypes.

We are own worst enemies."
6,Few hours on Reddit and that’s what you want to know?!
7,Why didn't you block him?
8,"The goal here is free Netflix, not sex."
9,"He made a porn. The purpose of porn is to watch it. Doesn’t matter if he’s gay or straight or in between, we just want to appreciate his hard work."
10,Looking around is not creepy. Staring at someone who notices you’re staring and is made uncomfortable by it is creepy.
11,"All you said can be from a straight guy that is flirty or playful and comfortable with you as a close friend. 

Accept he tells you he is straight, until he says otherwise"
12,your sanity increases
13,"Oh that’s fucked up man 

Internet hug?"
14,"Ego check, teasing, maybe he was drunk and had a stupid idea. We all do stupid stuff when we are drunk"
15,I think fucking in a public shower is more of being a creep than checking out guys in a locker room. Not judging for it but its weird that your friend is okay with one but not the other. And its not like they aren't checking out girls in bikinis.
16,These are confusing times
17,My teacher outed me to my parents when I was 12. I told people at school I was gay and it didn't go well. I had not planned to tell my parents.
18,"First of all, I am very sorry that has happened to you. It sucks. 

I don’t want to take away from your story but, for the first time, outside of counseling, I feel comfortable sharing mine. 

This guy was my best friend. We met at work(we were both 23) and soon we couldn’t stop hanging out together. We go to each other’s offices, always pair up for projects and spend weekends and free time hanging out. Even on Sunday mornings we would always go get coffee together. We were inseparable. We talked, we laughed...we did everything. 

A year after all that we decided to move into a house with 2 other mutual friends. It was so much fun. Late night ice cream runs, drunk pizza orders, binging seasons of tv like it was nothing. It was perfect. Nothing had changed. Until it did. He left for Christmas break and when he came back things had changed. 

Slowly we drifted apart. I got busy. He was unavailable. We stopped talking every day. Then every week. I’d send him texts...no reply. Sometimes we would go weeks without actually talking. I barely saw him. 

“Hey, it’s been awhile since we hung out. Wanna go grab coffee tomorrow morning...or we could go see_____ tomorrow night?”
“Nah. I don’t feel like it.”
“Are you ok?”
“Yep.”

Later in the semester I came home one night and no one was there. That’s not uncommon. That night all 3 roommates came home. They went to dinner and a movie and grabbed a beer together. Without me. He was supposed to invite me. He “forgot”.  Funny though, because i asked the others later and they said, according to him, he asked me but I was too busy and didn’t want to go. Wow. 

I tried to talk with him but he never stayed in the room long enough for me to finish speaking. 
It was a horrible time for me. Finally, on the night of his graduation I exploded. He brought other friends over to stay with him. It was made clear by another friend that I was not invited or welcome.  At 3:00 a.m. I left the house ugly crying, went to the gym for a few hours, slept in my car and then wrote a detailed text to him about how I was feeling and asking what had happened to us because overnight it just felt like this wall was put up between us. 

He didn’t respond. 

Three days passed and he still had not responded, by text or in person. 

I didn’t care. The ball was in his court. If he wanted even a chance to fix things, this was it. 

I was home alone four days after I sent the text. I went to the kitchen and was checking my email while cooking. He walked in. The air in the room was thick with silence. I didn’t bother to turn around. I wasn’t going to acknowledge his presence. 

“I guess we should talk,” he said. 
“I don’t have anything else to say,” I replied, tears forming in my eyes. 

We talked. He said something to the effect of “it wasn’t my intention to treat you that way but you’re responsible for your own feelings so if you felt bad that’s on you.” 

Two days later I came home and he was gone; his room was empty and all of his belongings had been taken. I sent him one more text asking about where he went. He didn’t reply. 

Even though the friendship had been dead for quite some time, I was still devastated that he was gone. I still cried. I still felt lonely. And I still wondered what I did to ruin our friendship. 

I’ve resigned myself the to fact that I will never know. And maybe that’s ok. But 1.5 years later the pain is still there. It’s not as big as it was at the beginning and it will sting less next year, but it is still there. 

You’re not alone dude. Like I said, it sucks. 

P.S. sorry for the rant."
19,"You do realize Grindr has a filter and you may be filtered out, perhaps by age?  Why didn't you block your uncle, hmm?  I think we all know [the answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsPJa_lVPHQ)."
20,"As a British person, I find him unbearable"
21,HE DOES NOT WANT TO FUCK YOU. GET THAT INSIDE YOUR HEAD. HE WILL NEVER FUCK YOU
22,It's not acceptable to anyone except the PnP crowd. Stop hanging around them and stop thinking you're so special.
23,Internet group hug?
24,"Save it up for a few days. My cumshots are pretty impressive after about 3 days of not cumming.

Also lots of water."
25,Man up and get over it.
26,"Yes, that anger is a waste of energy. How can people be asked to understand that you’re in the closet and need more time to acknowledge publicly that you’re gay before they are ‘allowed’ to reach that conclusion themselves? To me personally, it sounds like your sister is trying to help you by putting out signals that she accepts you for who you are."
27,"DAMN. 

Block all those judgemental crazy over analyzing gays from your life. 

Everything we wear has a message, even our pijamas, most of the times the message is for ourselves and says something like “I want to be cozy and warm” but lots of people like to feel sexy in bed, have you ever heard of lingerie???

So, enjoy your sexy pijamas."
28,"Mickey fell ill. Ewing sarcoma. He faded in front of me for a year. I took care of him until the end. Like we promised. He died in my arms. Literally. He had been through so much pain that I didn't want him to suffer anymore. As he was drawing his last breaths he looked at me. I was crying. I saw in his look he had so much fight left in him. He wanted to fight death for me but he was tortured, I knew asking him to hold on would be selfish and at that moment I felt some light shine inside my heart. So I just hugged him really tight and told him 'it's okay to let go Mickey, I will always love you and I will be fine I promise'. Then for a few short moments I looked at his eyes. He closed his eyes. He was struggling to breathe. I closed my eyes too and held him. A few moments later I felt his body relax completely. This all went down in a minute or two but I remember it like it was a lifetime. Every second of it is imprinted in my brain forever."
29,"This requires not one, but two people who want to sleep with me... not happening"
30,"Damn love to hear this, gives me a little confidence to just say fuck it and get over that fear myself. I still have yet to formally ask a gay guy out"
31,"Internalized homophobia, buddy. Continue working on how to resolve that if you can.

I'm out, I met a (straight) guy at my new job and he just assumed I was gay. We actually joked about it and after a few days of hanging out at lunch break and stuff we exchanged numbers.

Nothing bad happened and I made a new friend. Life's so much easier when you're out and can be yourself."
32,Other kids were bullying me after I told them I was gay.
33,“Looks gay but cute asf” get outta that mindset and it’ll help you accept others and yourself more.
34,"Thank you. You understand. I never had such a close friend as an adult. I truly would die for him if I had to. I was also careful not to crowd him, embarrass him, or be needy. I always gave him and his wife space. To know what I did wrong would help. He gave me a very nice and expensive gift the day he left. I guess that was the ""kiss off"" pat on the head. I'd trade it in a heartbeat for a ""What's up, bro"" email. Thank you for caring."
35,This is when it's YouTube and lots of lube time
36,"People afflicted with suicide seem impulsive to those of us who are not. 

Therapeutic intervention is not an event, but a longer process. 

Nothing you could have done could have helped unless he had been willing to be truthful rather than secretive in his despair."
37,"Where are your priorities? You can play Skyrim any time.

You just got free NetFlix, but you're not going to use it?"
38,"I’m a black gay man &amp; trust me, racism is not ‘dying down’. Bigotry is very much still alive &amp; people now feel way more comfortable being open with their views, because of these populist leaders."
39,That's why you don't get laid
40,"Never have, never will"
41,How did your teacher find out?
42,"Friendships often fade. Peoples lives and priorities change, especially after they get married and their lives take off. Friendships are often fill-ins for companionship until people find their long term partners. This is analagous to 'bromance.' After that its just a few texts a year and maybe some meetups if they still live in the area."
43,never go full incel. thats what therapy is for. save the pity party for the loss of a loved one or a terminal illness diagnosis. incelism is a choice. take your meds.
44,"Oh god, this is my biggest fear. I live with my best friend (same situation - he’s straight and I’m not) and have always been terrible at meeting new people and making friends. We’ve gotten to be very close and I know that I can share anything with him and still have his support. I even joke that he’s my SBF (straight boyfriend) and he could give two shits about it. That’s just the kind of guy he is. I know I’d be crushed without him in my life. I guess I would eventually adjust (like you will have to do OP) but it would be painful. Good luck sir - hang in there."
45,That is correct. I am attracted to the gym but I don't actually like the gym....so yeah.
46,Just tell me who to vote for
47,"It's not ""generally true.""  It's true of some gay men.  Personally?  Not interested."
48,Obviously it's too late for you but for everyone else reading: there's a vaccine for Hep A.  Get all the vaccinations you can guys.
49,"That sounds horrible 

How did your parents take it?"
50,🤢🤮
51,"I don't think 1 lb per week is the actual cutoff. Maybe 2 lbs.

10 sounds a little wild to me, though."
52,"Ugh, virtue signalling."
53,"God it hurts. I know. My hubby has been gone since March.

I just remembered I have all of our IRC (Internet Relay Chat) conversations from the wild-west days of the internet. So there's something to be said for computers. I have his thoughts from 1996.  We had a running conversation on Google Hangouts that goes back to 2009.

I hope you kept voicemails. I've got 19 voicemails. I can't listen to them right now. I'm going to save the recordings when I can bear listening to them."
54,Leave it alone. Don’t acknowledge it because you are in a professional setting
55,"Being sexually abused by a man does not ""turn"" people gay, no."
56,"To save other's Googling efforts, these are supplements"
57,Could someone be using his picture?
58,"I mean we're all have eyes, and if a body is attractive there's nothing wrong with just looking. It's not like you're doing something. Your friend is overreacting, Im pretty sure we're all checking out other guys in gym's changing rooms or in pools."
59,People post this weekly do you aren’t the only one..
60,I second that - he’s not funny. I think people only think he’s funny or slightly entertaining because he’s British. You know how Americans love an accent.
61,"Homosexual men on average have larger penises.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/10410197/"
62,"Um... Are you a virgin or something? You need to yank his cock like the pull starter on a chainsaw, then he'll turn on."
63,I'd recommend a fleshlight unless you're into spark play.
64,What?
65,Creep.
66,I agree about no assumptions but you’re still allowed to be hurt and definitely still allowed to factor that into how you receive him if he ever reaches back out.
67,"Some people are homophobes because of repressed homosexuality, but not all homophobes are like that."
68,"See, because you said you don't like professional stuff and now you say that those amateurish guys on reddit are mostly ugly for you. Also saying things like:

&gt;  weirdly-shaped/small dick/flabby bodies 

is just mean. But maybe for a perspective, can you maybe put a pic of your body?"
69,"I have seen plenty on reddit- you are right, this advice just really spoke to me in particular."
70,Hey bud wanna suck on my willie?
71,You're a fucking mess. Lol
72,"But by law, you don't have to. He is obligated by law to pay it until the lease is up unless he can find someone to take over his portion of the lease. Your OP says you don't want to make it easy for him, so don't."
73,"This should definitely become a thing.

Edit: Call it newt4newt and have a lizard as the symbol 🦎💚🦎"
74,"Damn who's cutting onions😭😭😭😢 I'm so sorry for your loss and I wish I could hug you and comfort you with the pain you're experiencing. But know that you're never alone and that he's waiting for you to embrace you again when it's time. But now, it's time to heal and connect with others, especially family and friends. 

You're a real beautiful soul and I know your husband was just as amazing as you. ❤️❤️🏳️‍🌈"
75,I have videos. Voice mails. Pictures. His voice on our answering machine. I can't bring myself to delete it.
76,Sucks! I went through something like that early on. Good Luck Bro!
77,I think two of my close friends *might* suspect it but they’ve never confronted me. Mostly b/c the probably hope it isn’t true.  Homophobia is real in my city.
78,"If you're concerned about privacy, don't use a GPS based hookup app."
79,"It has no long term effect.  Short term, getting rammed a lot makes it more comfortable to be fucked.

&gt;He told me it was a reminder my ass belonged to him

I'm stealing that."
80,"You're crying writing this, and we're crying reading it.  Some of us (like me) who are of a certain generation are crying in part because it's so painfully familiar, especially the experience of holding someone we love who's taking his last breaths and is trying to resist death for us, only to let go when we reassure him that it's okay to leave us, it's okay to go, it's okay to stop fighting.  But some of us are crying no doubt because we are so moved by just how fortunate you have been to have had one another all these years, to have grown up with and supported each other, and to have shown the world what love actually is.  We are moved and undoubtedly more than a little envious.  Your glorious example, I hope, will serve as inspiration for those of us who still only dream of the love that you effortlessly attained.  One might look at your story and weep with pity that Mickey was taken from you so soon.  But another might look and feel only *admiration* that you had achieved so much with so little to sustain you."
81,"I mean if your only interested in guys and never in women, I don't see how you are bi? So I would consider you gay."
82,"""Are you flirting with me? Because it's working."""
83,"Abusers tend to target victims that they believe are vulnerable.  

I have heard stories from gay men who were sexually abused when they were younger and they maintain they were targeted because they were gay or showed signs of being gay outwardly that they didn’t realize internally at a younger age.

And for the record—I was never sexually abused. 

Sexually harassed as an adult at work and in private? Yes."
84,"To achieve peacefulness you need to walk away from negativity and let go of toxic people.

You, sir, are a toxic person."
85,You will be very popular on Grindr.
86,work out. eat well. get sleep. wash your face. it's not hard. btw 29 is not old.
87,"Yes, I know he was a predator. I was too young to know better at the time."
88,"imma big fan of dick, Im such a fan that you might have to call me a AC, and I have never ever been even closed to be secually abused"
89,"Y'all know bi guys and open relationships exist, right?"
90,"i think of it not only as a spectrum, but as if it fluctuates through time. when I was little I had crush on girls as often as I crushed on boys so 50 vs 50, however crushes on girls were bigger. as I got into my teens the scales tipped towards asexuality (weird I know) and in my young adulthood I preffer men over women by a huge difference, but that might be because I am in love with a man and do not want anything else but him."
91,Well I have a sister so I’d say I’m pretty large compared to her
92,What in the Sweet home Alabama.
93,"I happen to be a virgin, but I'm going to pass on the toxic subculture and blame-shifting."
94,"As time went on and my straight friends paired off with ladies, I learned this to be sadly true. I was friends with my group since we were kids, but now I see them maybe 3 times a year if I'm lucky."
95,Eeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..... Ok...
96,I’d politely decline and just leave him with an open-ended “Perhaps we’ll run into each other sometime in the future”
97,I had the exact same thought reading this.
98,"This post sounds a bit nasty but it’s the truth. 

This really needs to be addressed!  I am “white Latino” and know lots of others like me and most are open minded about dating others.  Every (east) Asian I know only is interested in white ones. Ask these same Asians who complain about this how many times they court, idk, .. black or south Asian guys.

You can’t have it both ways"
99,"who is he? and honestly, why does this post need to exist?"
100,here bitch. the most romantic thing I've done with a girl was going ice-skating in 5th grade
101,I was told that since I was born c-section I'm platinum level.
102,I got them and it didn't settle me down one bit.  I think I got even sluttier and more whorish.
103,"I would try to be affectionate and caring. I can be silly sometimes, so I'd want to make my boyfriend laugh a lot lol. I think overall I'd just want to make him happier and to help him with whatever his goals are, whether that means providing direct encouragement and support, or being a good partner and indirectly motivating him. Oh and of course I'd want to cuddle a lot and fall asleep in his arms haha"
104,"No, just say you're straight and curious about bottoming and sucking dick for the first time in your profile and you'll have a ton of guys lining up."
105,"He remembers, probably doesn't care. Don't bring it up, just treat him like you treat your other coworkers. I doubt he will bring it up but If he does just tell him it was a one time thing and that you are in a relationship now. I wouldn't worry about bringing it up to your partner unless it becomes an issue, no reason to make him worry about something that is probably a non issue"
106,Maybe he doesn’t dislike you. Maybe he wants to fuck you and it’s awkward for him so he just doesn’t say anything at all.
107,No
108,Thank you . You are wise.
109,"NO! Cockatiels need a lot of attention too, and definitely don't like to be alone."
110,Even if he was cute I'd still say no.
111,"Big, extensive grocery shopping trips."
112,Damn I’m really sorry you had to go through this. It sucks that you had to go through prolonged mourning of your friendship
113,"You should 100%, absolutely, unequivocally, move on."
114,You might not be as straight as you think you are ;)
115,"I blocked my significant other because it was just the right thing to do.
It was right after I found out he hosted a haters roast (about me) with some of my ""friends"" and previous exes at a bar I always went to.

At first, I was kind impressed that I pissed off enough people to want to roast me. But after I found out two of them fuckers cheated on ME...I was like, okay....time to reevaluate my friend group here. I blocked some people, deleted their contact info and never looked back.

One of the best decisions I made."
116,"The longer it takes, the lower his IQ."
117,"Who has the damage deposit? The landlord?

Is he on the lease with you?"
118,Or eating someone's ass lol
119,"Thanks for sharing. I am crying as I write this.

Wish you lots of love."
120,It’s all just dick to me.
121,"Wait… they’re too drunk to recognize their better half in this example? 
Although I think I get what you’re getting at. It’s like when my step dad was coming out of anesthesia and was telling the nurse caring for him all about how his wife (my mother) is a nurse and how amazing she (my mother) is and how much he cares about her."
122,Fuck yeah man. Good job.
123,"The ones with the most to say have the most to hide in my experience. Again, only my experience."
124,Lol
125,"I can appreciate the way you are feeling. I too had the misfortune of being brought up in a Christian household that was repressive. However, I'm not sure about how productive it would to continue this hatred. It's tiring and I have just moved on to brighter and happier things"
126,Every now and then. Sometimes it takes me a bit to bust because of nerve damage and I know I won’t stop going full-force until I cum so I try to be considerate of the bottom and I’ll just fake it. But then you’ve got those magical bottoms who just want you to go to town on them as long as you possibly can and...those men deserve awards.
127,"If he doesn't respond, he's clearly not interested."
128,"Nothing, for fucks sake.  He’s straight."
129,"Yes but I really regret it, these days tho people know that a lot of homophobes are closeted so that probably dosnt work at all."
130,On what planet is perving on guys in the locker room not being a creep?
131,Getting sexually abused doesn’t and will not make you gay
132,"I didn’t come out until I was 22.

But from, like, sixth grade on, I was called every gay slur under the sun because I had a friend who was also seen as gay and I was a late bloomer, puberty-wise (at least in terms of voice changes and the such). High school was the worst—I was basically called a specific slur every single day by one of the football players and was bullied up through senior year of high school by people who assumed they knew what my personal life was like.

Did it infuriate me? God, yes.  

But...outwardly...I was decent at sports, but never get the urge to participate in any or even watch it or talk about it. To this day, I can’t tell you the first thing about football.  

I was not necessarily interested in getting in shape until my senior year (and good thing I did).

I freely admit to female crushes, but I never had any girlfriends.  I’m sure people couldn’t not notice my wandering eyes in the locker rooms or when a shirtless guy would pass. 

Basically, I wanted love and to fuck anything that walked when I was knee-deep in the hormones.

And in secret—-I was looking at gay porn, admiring the guys in the straight porn I watched, jerking off with my ‘also viewed as gay’ friend (to straight porn, no less, because we wanted to put on the veil of hetero-ness), and stealing chances to watch Queer As Folk and Will and Grace when my parents weren’t looking. 

At 21, I moved out and did my soul searching and I realized that I was a big ol’ ‘mo and later came out to my parents when I got my first boyfriend.

At the time, in retrospect, I’m sure others could see the signs. And I’m okay with it now.  But even right before I came out, I did kind of resign myself to the fact that there was no use in hiding who I was, even without the gay parts. 

I was the computer geek who didn’t care about sports, I was the one who discovered a love of writing, who was increasingly comfortable with who he was, following graduation from high school.  I was the one who says ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ and holds the door open for those behind me and lets ladies go first.  I realized I was more mature than others my age, and arguably had my shit together more than a few others who went on to create a mess for themselves. 

I realized I was actually pretty normal. 

Oh, and the football player who called me a slur every day in high school?  He spent 8 years in prison for dealing crack cocaine in a children’s park and participating in a home invasion.

Moral of the story—toxic masculinity is toxic for a reason. And when I realized I would be masc, but not Uber-masc and never a straight boy, I became a lot more at peace with whatever shit was thrown my way.  And now, I’m pretty much bulletproof. 

Now, if only I could find a guy to bring home to Mom and Dad..."
133,"You might want to reconsider the h8. When you finally come out, people are gonna gate-keep you hard, from both sides of the fence.

How to explain the change? ""I'm tired of being shitty to people I don't even know."""
134,You definitely have to break up with her.
135,Yay!!  Good for you!!
136,"Good for you! And way too cute, at the library awwww"
137,Give us updates!
138,"Wow this is exactly as you said, beautifull and sad at the same time. It's overwhelming, your love story is amazing, the ending is heartbreaking. I'm speechless. Stay strong, you have the right mindset. Your angel is watching you and wants you to be happy."
139,r/relationships seems to be showing its face here. Serious disagreement? Better get a divorce!
140,Did he sign a lease?  Because he owes you rent until you find a new roommate or the lease is up.
141,I’m 6’4 and my bf is about 5’5. Honestly being fetishised for my height is really annoying and my boyfriend never doing it is one of the reasons we work.
142,"Are you sexually attracted to women? Do you like tits, female asses, or vaginas?"
143,Is your boyfriend on ssri’s?
144,Not well and my relationship with my parents was never the same.
145,No.
146,"Keep in mind once everyone grows up, most people will not really care how you were in high school/middle school.

Even people who bullied me for example, I know they have grown up and probably have different opinions now. I would not hold their behavior against them. They were just kids like I was."
147,"Like every other question of this kind: there are guys who are into people with your body type, and guys who aren't."
148,That’s your problem.
149,"&gt; This is the best advice I have ever seen on Reddit. 

Ok let's all calm down now"
150,It’s very common. Homophobic married “straight” dads are everywhere trying to hook up with guys. I could tell you stories that would turn your hair white.
151,"Can't say I noticed, but I always thought europeans were just more free-spirited sexually and americans are more conceited. I can see more americans using the app for their ego than europeans"
152,"Sounds like you want more than you're letting on, if you only want a friendship then you shouldn't be bothered by who else he's fucking and talking to, unless you to are in an exclusive relationship whom ever else he is seeing is none of your business to be honest."
153,"gay for pay is common in porn. plus, they're getting pretty good with edits now."
154,"My love language is ""acts of service."" I find most tops reveal their true selves once they sense you are sacrificial/submissive. It helps weed out the bad actors  who want the authority without the responsibility. 

No trauma. It is one form of sexual expression. For me, it is exhilarating to give up my public type A persona &amp; become a manwife for a real man. The juxtaposition turns me on...especially if he understands the psychological implications of my switch...and plays into it.

Tl dr: I'm super sub, but only if a top meets certain criteria and treats his slut like a prince(ss). Yup. I'm confused."
155,I find public sex hot as fuck honestly 🤷🏾‍♀️ I love amateur public sex vids
156,That was hot. The bottom was hot
157,You should feel confident in who you are it really is not that important at the end of the day what others identify you as. Im personally bi and would fuck women but im currently dating a guy and would definitely marry a man over a woman. I tell people im gay and if they asked bc i made a comment about a women I’ll clarify that im bi. Also its not important to tell everyone and there mother about it. Most of my family doesn’t know and i have not bothered to correct them bc i want to see their face when they meet my bf lol. Just be confident and people change and so will your tastes.
158,"Well, no, why would I want to bag a straight guy? He doesn’t like men or having sex with them.

166,I maintain a hairy bum. BF loves it.
167,but why did he send me a nude pic? straight guys do not send nude pics to their bi/gay friends? this has left me quite confused
168,"Actually I didn’t think of the filter thing, so I guess there’s a chance he hasn’t seen me!"
169,"We should wear blinders.... I think there is a line between casual interest and intense staring or leering. One is natural and the other is a tad creepy. The act of looking around and noticing isn't in itself creepy. It is what happens after that first glance.

170,"There’s plenty of stuff that you can get that’s relatively cheap.

As for your physicality, compensate. A terry cloth headband like John McEnroe used to wear to keep the sweat out if his eyes. A glasses headband to keep them in place, or glasses with a greater curve to hold the ear, like wireframe.

208,"One of my first fuckbuddies would pick me up and unzip my pants and mindlessly play with my dick while he drove to his place. We also just made small talk and got to know eachother a little bit.

Anything sexual has a risk of making it very awkward if he's not into it, but if it's something you might like you could suggest it in a flirty way.

Otherwise just make small talk. Ask about his day, what he does for work, for fun, etc. Being outwardly comfortable around him and sociable is hot, being clammed up and awkward is typically not. If he doesn't reciprocate then that's on him and his nerves. Feel good that you went out of your comfort zone and put in the effort to make the encounter friendlier and better."
209,I would ignore him. He’ll probably just block you after he finds out it’s you

Maybe that benefit has some friends that you’re friends with.

216,"I (14M) was involved in a relationship with the church organist (24M). Someone saw something (kissing I think) and told my parents. It was really bad. 1st my dad and mom confronted me. Later they confronted him. Then when I wouldn’t tell them anything or talk to the police, they couldn’t do anything to him, he denied anything had happened. Just told church my folks were lying. I ended up catching most of the heat. My folks sent me to therapy, then when I came out to my therapist they sent me to an ex gay program. This was a long time ago, (1982)."
217,**Gives you Internet Hug**
218,"The only person who's ever attempted to ""out"" me was an ex with serious personality problems (which were not immediately apparent, and I ended things when I realized the extent of that.) However, he was not aware that most people he tried telling I was gay were already aware that I'm bisexual. All he accomplished was to make it very apparent why I'd dumped him, far better than I could have if I'd tried to explain it myself.

He even went so far as to try ""outing"" me to my family, who were already aware of my sexuality, and was so desperate to inflict that upon me that he tried bothering my nephew with it (who was 10 years old at the time.) At that point he was told in no uncertain terms that he'd come to serious and extremely painful harm if he ever attempted to contact any member of my family again. I was content to let him make a jackass of himself previous to that, but the notion of my nephew being approached in any fashion by someone like him is nothing sort of appalling.

The most sickening part of it was that, in his twisted mind, this was done in an attempt to make me ""be who I really am"" (a phrase he's obsessively fond of.) That ended up creating in me a serious revulsion reflex toward anyone I hear using anything remotely resembling that phrase."
219,"*heavy sigh*

Every time we drink together he ends up sitting on my lap or leaning against me to be held? Nope, just the alcohol.

Plays the ""nervous game"" all the way up my thigh with a nice squeeze at the top, then proceeds to rest his head on my shoulder for the remaining 15 minutes of bus ride? Nope, did a lot of molly in high school and REALLY likes physical contact.

I don't give a shit if anyone uses Kodi, or pirates movies the old fashioned way or whatever, just please use a VPN and don't spread misinformation claiming it's legal to do. It's still piracy. People should be aware of that going in."
223,"What I always find really bizarre about these people that insist LGBT+ people are ""choosing"" to be gay is the idea that why would anyone *choose* a life of potential isolation, potential rejection from friends/society/family, higher rate of mental health issues and a smaller dating pool among other things?\*

If you think of life as like a game then being gay wouldn't really be a fantastic strategic choice straight off the bat. Even with the social advances we've got to at this point there're still people in Western countries that can experience rejection from family, friends and community. You're still a higher risk of mental health difficulties and LGBT+ people have a higher rate of suicide. Lastly, your dating pool is smaller and it's more challenging to meet other gay guys just out and about - all in all, not amazing. If you were starting a new game of life you'd be like ""wow, this is like picking a hard modifier.""

Sure, you sometimes get positive discrim and you're more likely to get into a dual income-no kids situation (pretty much the financially strongest family unit), but you won't necessarily not get that setup if you were straight instead. One thing I will say is that if you are able to get past the idea that you're in a worse position then I think LGBT+ people can end up mentally stronger as they've had to handle an adversity that many other people won't go through. Having to challenge an accepted mode of thinking (everyone is straight) definitely helped me to be more accepting and ""live and let live"" about other people's lives as well as be more comfortable with myself.

But, overall, choosing something that risks making you isolated and rejected isn't really something I imagine people would pick as a general rule if they were allowed to choose at the start of their life. I can't speak for everyone, but I know when I realised I was gay then I was like ""oh this isn't exactly ideal."" Obviously, I'm totally fine and love myself now, but that certainly wasn't my first reaction and - at that point - I'm sure I'd have appreciated an ""easier"" straight life.

\* For the record, I said no one would *choose* to be gay at, say, the onset of life, but now many of us are part way through and got through the hard bit of accepting ourselves and finding an environment that accepts us then I doubt there're many people that would choose to take some kind of drug that changed you to straight - I know I certainly wouldn't at this point, I've no reason to, my life is totally fine as is and I'm fine with being gay."

226,A lot of gay men will not want a woman present or involved during any kind of erotic encounter.  A lot of gay men aren't interested in hooking up with guys who are attached.  Many gay men aren't interested in bi guys.  So you're starting out with significant barriers.  You're far better off using apps/dating sites and trying again with swingers events.  And you should probably be looking for other bi guys.

For the skin - wash your face and moisturize daily.  Sun exposure will quicken those wrinkles, especially if you have light skin.  Use protection.

For the hair - there is treatment out there if you want to try and save it.  Now is the time to jump on it, if you do.  There are two proven treatments - minoxidil (rogaine) and finasteride (propecia).  I'm on Fin and seen great results.  r/tressless has a lot of info on these treatments.

Is this a wife or girlfriend?

If wife, that is your house. You can literally break the door down and sleep in your own bed and eat whatever is in your fridge. When you are married everything you two own belong to each other. Neither of you can kick the other out.  If she calls 911 then tell the cops ITS YOUR HOUSE. They can't do anything. If you are not married then it depends on whose name is on the lease/mortgage

Now if you've been abusive to her and she has a restraining order out against you, that's another story.

I don't understand why you need a special support group focusing on outed people. Sounds like what you need instead is to speak with a therapist or counselor. There are a lot of free or affordable counseling/therapy out there. Just google. It doesn't have to be gay focused. Therapists are trained to talk you through all kinds of issues.

Also this doesn't sound like outing is the problem. Sounds like you cheated and lied and got caught. You can't blame that on being gay.

I did that one summer in college, and I went away for Memorial Day weekend, came back and his girlfriend was surprisingly still there.  He informs me that her father and the girlfriend had a blowout argument, and she was gonna be moving into the apartment for the summer, she would pay 1/3 the rent.  There wasn't any questioning me if it was okay, it was just happening.   The bedrooms were adjacent and the walls were thin, and I could hear them having sex every night, which just sucked.  That friendship was never the same after that, and eventually completely faded.  I think it's a huge risk living with a best friend, and possibly any friend.   Better to start rooming with a stranger and hope you become friends."

Yet I've had straight friends who were very close and kidded in shocking ways. If he is a real cut up, he may just be straight and silly. You cannot make him face being gay if he is. He has to do that. I suggest just keep on being his good friend, be there for him, and don't risk the friendship by pushing him on the issue.

Learn to love yourself.  Maybe see a therapist. And if your surroundings are bothering you, a new neighborhood is $2.75 away."
