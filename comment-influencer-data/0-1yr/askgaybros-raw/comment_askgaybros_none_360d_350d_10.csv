0,No condom=no sex. Good on you for staying safe
1,Tell him that you just can't keep up having to pay for your half of everything when he keeps choosing such expensive activities. You'll both either need to adjust them to more reasonably-priced things or he's going to have to pay some of your cost too when you go.
2,Your mom will come to terms man. You can’t help who you are. I would talk to your brother and build that bond with him. He could be a great ally for you. 
3,"Had an uber driver taking a friend and I to the most popular gay club in our city.

&amp;#x200B;

""Yeah I used to go here a lot, but those gay guys were asking for a face full of fist when they kept hitting on me.""

&amp;#x200B;

We were like uhhhh..... "
4,"And it’s always the most unattractive straight guys that complain about it, yeah, I’m sure you get hit on all the time, with your Walmart jeans and face like a bag of spanners. 

"
5,"He's the one with the dirty ass mate, he's the one who needs to feel ashamed."
6,"Just try not to frame it as taboo. 

Yes you feel attracted, but that's a natural reaction for a man who's attracted to men in some way. 

Just tuck it up into your waistband, be little spoon so ya don't poke around in your sleep, and enjoy the nice warm cuddles with your friend. 

Then maybe go meet a different guy (who is gay) in the meantime and *unleash the kraken*."
7,"Hold your head up high, and laugh hysterically inside."
8,"Theres absolutely no reason to be embarrassed of conversations about money. Everyone needs it, everyone earns different amounts of it and it's one of the most common and human things. For whatever reason, society forces some silly prudery around it.

Besides, theres no relationship without conversation."
9,Be honest. This could lead to some real bad shit but be honest and he will understand.
10,"And OP is worried about using his boyfriend as a sugar daddy. Which clearly means that’s not what he’s using him as, if that makes sense.

OP if your boyfriend understands where you are coming from and truly values the relationship I’m sure he’ll gladly cover more expenses so you aren’t strained. Or he’ll just tone it back spending wise on dates/vacations."
11,You'll never have to deal with unwanted pregnancies 
12,"You’re doing just fine :) 

Keep things in the same vein. 

Nothing you’ve done is wrong. "
13,"I share a bed with straight friends all the time when we go on trips or have a night out so I get where you’re coming from.

Only advice I can give is to convince yourself that you’re not interested and focus on going to sleep when you go to bed.
The more you focus on it and get excited by it, the harder it’ll be (pardon the pun)"
14,"I’m relieved to find out he’s straight. If he were gay, the only thing separating us would be his lack of sexual interest in me."
15,"I mean basically my whole life I was only ever interested in men. Only ever watched gay porn. Only ever fantasized about being with men. Yet still basically told myself, “yeah I’m definitely straight. This is perfectly normal behavior for a heterosexual”"
16,That's what I'm doing. I've heard him whimper and moan I don't think she has XD
17,"My guy did kind of the same thing once. He was asleep, but I was still awake. He laid beside me, and suddenly he seems uncomfortable/scared. He rolled into my arms and pressed his butt up against my junk. He calmed when I layed my arm around him."
18,"This week, in ""recreational outrage"", grown adults get upset because puppets from a 40 year old PBS  show don't fit thier head cannon. "
19,Get 👏 his 👏 number! 👏
20,if they say the characters arn't gay then they arn't theres nothing wrong with that
21,I doubt that. He wouldn't even send me a face pic before we met up. He had me install Skype and video chatted lol. He's so deep in the closet Narnia had to send him through immigration.
22,"I find it hilarious when a guy stands with his back against the wall and as soon as his girlfriend walks in hugs her tightly in front of him as a beard, eh, shield.

If you’re that worried about being in a gay bar, you’re not comfortable in your sexuality."
23,"Probably not related, but a few years ago I was in the OR having leg surgery and while I was ""under"" I grabbed hold of the surgeon's junk and wouldn't let go.  Wish I could remember cause he's really good looking..."
24,Eventually he’ll get something that can’t be cured so that’s on him. You probably dodged a bullet.
25,"I hit on a straight guy at a gay club and he said his girlfriend was in the bathroom. 

She shows up and he goes “Babe this guy just hit on me. I’m a total stud.”

And she goes “great, thanks a lot. his ego is already out of control.”

It made me smile lol"
26,Tell her “omae wa mou shindeiru” and walk away
27,"Purely recreational sex is much more readily available to you than to most straight men.

Personal relationships with women are not complicated by sex.

No one will ever surprise you with the words: 'I'm pregnant and it's yours.""

You get all the benefits, as well as the penalties, of being culturally marginalized.

Dicks are just more fun than vaginas.  (There, I said it.)

31,Know your audience duuuuude. 
32,I prefer breeding and drinking vodka.
33,"Does your mom have to live your unhappy life if you repress yourself? No, you're the one stuck living like that. 

Other people can stuff their petty desires when it comes to core parts of us, you need to be able to live your life, and it's not your mom that has to feel those feelings, it's not your mom that has to cry, or wonder if she'll ever be loved the way you see everyone around you being loved. 

Free yourself from these ideas that what other people want of you is anything to be taken into account in this regard. It's your life, and you only get one try, best live for yourself instead of your petty mother."
34,I've been trying to impregnate my boyfriend so many times :(
35,"Why are you ashamed? I’d be embarrassed, but not ashamed. It’s just hygiene. 

Just tell him, “sorry you had to see that. I should have closed the door. Won’t happen again!”

Then it’s done."
36,"First off, a big fuck you, because I'm sitting here bawling my eyes out reading your post.  Now my sinuses are all fucked up and I can't breathe and I can't see to tap out this message.

I love you!  You are beautiful.  Your parenting is near perfect.  That boy is so lucky to have you.  Honestly, I can't suggest a thing to you.  Keep doing what you are doing.  OMG I just love you all so much!  💚💚💚

37,"Youve already broken a major social taboo and are now more free to explore life away from ""normal"". It may not seem like much, but being willing to explore the weird parts of life is probably the biggest step towards being truly happy. Explore your life. Challenge yourself to find new ways to make yourself and your loved ones happy. Do things that you never thought you'd be interested in. Throw away your desire to fit in and instead find a desire to live your life according to your own roadmap."
38,"Excellent, from a lot of the threads I have seen in this sub, people dont practice enough self compassion.
"
39,"I was in a similar situation as you (full time student with zero income outside of summer low-wage jobs, my boyfriend of 3 years is a professional making 150k+). Presumably he knows your situation already, so it shouldn't be that hard of a conversation. In my case I just told him that when I graduate and find a job in my field, I will be more than happy to do these things, but right now I don't have the resources. He really likes to travel, which is completely out of my price range. I made it clear that I don't expect him to pay for anything, and if he really wants to do something, I have no problem with him going without me. He was 100% fine with that. Sometimes he will pay for me, sometimes he will go by himself (i.e on a trip somewhere), sometimes we will just compromise and do something in my price range instead.

It's really not reasonable to expect a 22 year old in a low wage job to be able to afford these things. If he makes a big deal out of it, then that would be a major red flag IMO."
40,"Just go full confident: march up with a smile on your face and say ""so that's how gay people prevent getting shit on their dicks, any questions? No? Great, let's pretend you never saw that. So I need.."""
41,"He sounds like an asshole, I’m sorry OP. I know you’ll find a kinder, more open minded guy"

43,To be fair not everyone likes getting hit on at the bar. Period. 
44,"I don't know man, sounds a lot like internalized homophobia to me."
45,"No, no, I don't like doing that. I'm unique like that you see."
46,Now the question is why did you leave it open while cleaning ass?
47,does your boyfriend have a magical perpetually-lubed anus?
48,I'd rather not fuck him again. Nothing personal about him but he wasn't as enthusiastic as I like. He's got a bigger one than me by an inch or two so she wasn't wrong. I didn't get to really enjoy it because he couldn't get hard through most of our fun. When he did though it was nice to play with. 
49,"If she becomes too much, have sex with him again. Btw, did he have a big cock?"
50,These people aren’t here to ask for help. They’re literally here to just complain about how much their life sucks. Same type of people to make indirect passive aggressive Facebook posts for the attention.
51,"Yes, found out he is on prep, but those pills only stop you from getting HIV. He could get everything else."
52,"Im Chinese and the only son within my immediate family- I went through a world of pain trying to avoid breaking my parent's hearts out of sheer love. In the end, they pressured/guilt-tripped my first love apart and celebrated at my misery. It took me months of grieving before a switch flicked- I will never let them get in the way of my life's fulfillment and joy again. My dad has already threatened to cut me off financially as soon as I turn 25 (when I become ineligible for his tax breaks.) Don't make the same mistake I did. Your life is worth more than her [you'll soon to discover to be quite shallow/misguided/selfish] dream."

58,"I used to do this as well when I was in my 20's. It's similar to sleep walking.  I would wake up half way through when i was already balls deep in my boyfriend. He loved it, I was always confused but finished anyway. "
59,Some of my straight friends took me to gay bar for my birthday. 
60,Cause people have nothing better to do than to be spiteful 🤷‍♂️
61,"I definitely went through a ""I like both boys and girls, but only see myself emotionally with a girl"" phase. "
62,Not exactly. Sex is a slow burn for me but once that switch is flipped its hard not to think of things sexually. For example my most recent FWB and I knew each other for quite a while before messing around. We cuddled almost constantly when we first met with no sex but once we did introduce sex it was hard to go back. We're both into cuddles &amp; sex though so it works out.
63,"I had a similar situation when I was a freshman in college. I recommend going to the administration and seeing if they can do anything about it.

67,"Straight people are weird. They think about a biological legacy, and the fact that that is “destroyed” by a generation of non-heterosexuals. 

Ultimately most get over it when they realise what an infantile desire it is and that it’s essentially just a result of cultural pressure demanding a genetic heritage. Gay children can still deliver grandchildren into the family by other means, and even if they don’t, most parents only care that their children are happy. "
68,"And empty of shit? 

A guy I was dating once tried to fuck me in the morning after waking up. Um no hun"
69,"Hahahaha...!!! Your story made me laugh! Haha! 

ANYWAY. Not to get your hopes up, but my straight friend slept in my bed for 1 year and eventually we did oral. Eventually he was repulsed by the oral and I suppose by me too. Eventually he realised he was gay. Eventually we became best buddies. Yay!

I had soooo many fantasies watching that stupid sexy meat of a man lying next to me. Definitely drooled. HAHA"
70,Nani!

I mean, does it happen that some gay men go hard into the gay? Yes.

Do mildly-homophobic straight people use this to justify their homophobia? Yes.

You have to take it on a case-by-case basis.

Some straight people try to justify their homophobia by thinking that any gay culture is immediately inferior (and some just can't handle seeing gay people be gay).  And some gay people cruise gay spots and never develop other interests.

Gay is just a small part of who I am.  But, at the same time, I am always gay.  That's healthy.  And some straight people can't handle that I am always gay.  And some gay people can't distinguish between being always gay, and being nothing but gay."
77,"Is it ""no, I don't want to get married"" or ""no, I don't want to marry *you*""?

What else was said other than ""no""? "
78,"Just to take a second here and point this out: if you had blocked him instead of him blocking you, you’d be lauded. Instead he blocked you, so you came here to elicit sympathy; he did what he should have, and you should have. If you’re not compatible about something so basic as condom use, you should block and move on. It’s not a negotiable point here for either of you, so this is literally the best outcome.

By-the-by (by the ‘bi’?), in pointing out the he has a girlfriend without the context you have in a comment in the thread (that she knows he’s bi and permits his behavior), you’re just shaming him for being bi, since it has *no relevance at all*.

You need to realize everyone is responsible for their own sexual health. You want condoms only, great. He doesn’t want to use them at all. So long as he and his sexual partners mutually understand that they’re going bareback, **that’s his business**.  He recognizes the risks he’s taking and gets tested for STDs with far great frequency than you do. What’s more, when he *did* contract one, he made sure to reach out to all of his partners to let them know.

Also, getting blocked on Grindr by a hookup isn’t ghosting; that’s standard etiquette for “not interested anymore”. You get ghosted by someone you’re dating, when they stop speaking to you suddenly and without warning, and either blocks or simply ignores you on whatever means of communication you used.

He was a hookup. Idk what you were expecting.

Dude’s practically a saint. He literally did everything right, and y’all still want to rant about him like he’s some stealthing dickbag who is lying about his status and cheating on his wife."

81,"I went on grindr one summer while I was back home to visit my family (I study abroad).

I hooked up with this guy and went to his place, we had a little smoke and I let him fuck me

No one has the right to hold you emotionally hostage (whether they're alive or dead). 

Ultimately, you understood that he wasn't the right fit for you long term. You need to remind yourself of this by putting it in writing. 

His suicide is tragic, unfortunate, and sad! It's not fair for Connor, his mother, or yourself to BLAME YOU! Connor decided to end his own life - he was in pain because his own poor choices fragmented the relationship. 

You moved on from Connor when you left him - you just need to move on again. "

96,Same. Guess we'll just have to keep trying 🤷‍♂️
97,"If you just tolerate each other then you have no worries.

To be honest you have no worries anyway. As a top I don't understand why guys get so embarrassed by cleaning out or a bit of shit for that matter. It's not like I don't know where I am putting my dick. It happens, you clean up and move on. If anything be confident that dat ass is so fine that someone wants to put their dick in it!

You have no reason to be ashamed for what you were doing, you have no reason to be ashamed because you like dick in your ass (as a top thank you for loving it!), and you have no reason to be ashamed for being gay.

Be proud! I know I am when any guy is willing to share his hot ass with me! No shame!"

115,"From personal experience:

- Becoming more open minded. I was too conservative and sad before I accepted it. But now I accept it and have dispelled a lot of archaic social constraints that I put on myself (both related- and unrelated- to homosexuality).

- Connecting to people on a global scale just because of being gay. You don't need common interests or hobbies. I made so many friends just because we're both gay. It goes with the idea of a shared struggle too.

118,"Hey there!

I am 35, married to my husband and we have three kids. I want to start off by saying you really couldn’t handle this any better than you are. You and your wife are basically doing the best possible thing at every moments your facing. 

Kids are kids and they are going to say things, it’s nothing you can control. Your going about this the right way, build his character and personality, build his emotions up to face these kids up so they do not bother him. This will take time and again if possible try and change his social environment, I know that might not be possible. 

An interesting thing is the conversation between him and the little girl, just what exactly happened there? What were they talking about? Did he say or admit something to her? I would not focus on it, just something to note. 

I am also a kid that was adopted, so I understand the unique situation you are in. He is family but you are not his birth parents. Your doing a fantastic job of building and continuing that bridge. People like you and your wife are very special and you save lives. Keep doing what your doing. 

A few suggestions: try and find other kids that have his disposition and tenderness and have them interact and play together. I do not know how gay friendly your church is but perhaps you can find someone that he would recognize as a church leader and explain to him that god loves him no matter what. This will help smash this idea that he has that god hates him or he will burn in Hell. Also this can be done with out him ever having to be asked if he is gay or not, this leader can just say something simple like god loves everyone, gay, straight, what ever. If that’s not an option you could try a child therapist, a good one can do incredible work and add a lot of positive reinforcement.  I like the idea of having him interact around your wife’s friends, the two gay men. It gives him something to normalize his views. 

At the end of the day he is a child. He could be gay, he could not have a clue what gay is, he might be curious/confused or he could just be the sweetest, kindest, tender heart kid who just doesn’t like the idea of anyone going to hell. Just keep hugging and loving him, be a guiding hand just like you are!

Keep doing what your doing! Your doing great!

119,"It sounds like your brother has some very real and relevant context in dealing with this. You didn't ask for advice, but I want to mention how invaluable having siblings in your corner can be if things get tense (depending on your relationship with him, of course)."

If it weren't for my backlog of games/movies, I'd already be dead. The only real purpose I have in life is going up to the animal shelter to read Harry Potter to the cats and frankly, that isn't about me, it's about the kitties. I want to better somebody else because if I can't live for me, I'll live for somebody else.

I hate myself so goddamn much. I wish I could just wear a mask for the rest of my life or tear my face off and slap on a new one. I'm tired of being an ugly sack of shit with fucked up teeth because my mom was neglectful in my early years (I never take pictures with teethy smiles, no can do), I'm tired of having A-Z mental issues, I'm tired of feeling like it's impossible to get out of bed every morning, let alone work out and put myself out there again.

If there's room for the audience to interpret Bert and Ernie as a gay couple, then they might be, and that's the end of that. 

It is just the inverse of the Dumbledore problem.  JK Rowling can insist that the character is gay to her heart's content, but there is nothing in the books or the films that forecloses his heterosexuality.  So the audience is free to believe he is straight, notwithstanding what the author has said.  "
140,You have Gillette to thank for that when they discovered they could be making double profits in the early 1900s. 
141,"Or, no, I don't want to get married right now?"
142,what the fuck did I just read
143,"The ""Work"" has to be done in order to enjoy the ""Reward"". 

In this case, the ""work"" is to reconcile your value system with your identity. 

The ""Reward"" is relief of depression and self - judgment. 

In order to do this to maximum effect, a doctor or counselor will ask you to do a variety of things, (Journaling, periodic therapy, perhaps medication to relieve drpression. ). In doing those things you will learn to CHANGE. Your thoughts (that others hate LGBT, that others are disgusted by us, and that LGBT could be targeted) will be replaced. They will modify to (others are aware of us, LGBT are not disgusting, and that being targeted is not a result of your demographic). Feelings are caused by thoughts. Thoughts in conflict with identity cause judgement and shame. Once the thoughts change the depression will lift. Often people have to wrap their head around the religion piece. Anxiety often does exacerbate the process. Seeking help in therapy to change thoughts is the most efficacious way to accomplish this, but often people do not see the whole process while walking along it, and tend to blame others for their overload of emotions and temporary derailments along the way. 

This is what some people mean by Acceptance of your gay identity. When you grow up with as much training to hate who you are as you obviously have, it does take some real work to accomplish the changes necessary to accept yourself. Doing this work may seem like a waste of time, but the paradise on the other side of self hate is self love. There is no drug to equal it, it is amazing to feel at peace with whom you really are. Don't give up, don't let anyone tell you ""we are disgusting"", God created gay people to show the world that his love had NO limits. Good Luck bro. "
144,"big FUCKING mood. but seriously, I often think I might fall somewhere on the ace spectrum for how little I enjoy sex without developing trust and friendship first and even then I often prefer cuddling over anything more overtly sexual"

148,"why would you take your girlfriend to a gay bar as a straight person? 

"
149,"Awww. Very cute.  Of course it can happen from Grindr hookups!   Is it common?  Who knows.  Point being, how you meet doesn’t matter...and it can happen anytime, anywhere...

Happy for you guys!"
150,Omg the gag of having 3 gay kids though can you imagine!!!! 
151,"Not all conservatives are evil people. Some of them have financially conservative beliefs and distrust the government's ability/right to control things. Perfectly reasonable. But a Trump supporter? Someone who supports him *now*, let alone in light of everything else he's done in the past? Impossible. Could you date an unrepentant rapist? An active-membership Klansmen? A Holocaust denier?

There is no way to justify romantic intimacy with someone who is actively, purposefully ignorant and hateful. You can attempt to befriend them, perhaps your compassion will eventually win them over and soften their hearts. But to bind your bodies, minds, and hearts together? To try to build a life together? What commonality do you have between you two? Liking same type of body? Fuck that. They don't deserve romantic love if they can't even see either human beings as worthy of life."
152,I am attracted to guys and I think dicks are nice 😱
153,"Eh, it's not that great, alot of girls won't date you cause it's a turn off or they think you're gay in denial, and alot of gay guys won't date you cause they think you'll leave them for a girl. Other bi people are ideal but they're harder to come by."
154,"I masturbate in my sleep apparently, so I sleepturbate? It was worse when I had a prescription for ambien because I would finish, clean up, and only realize I did anything when I tried to put my shirt on in the morning and it was obviously used to clean up jizz. You know, a wadded up crusty ball of sin. Anyway, my husband thinks it's hot but it's definitely something I'm mindful of whenever someone offers me their couch when visiting. ""Ah no, I think I'll get a hotel room, for uhm...the points."""
155,"He’s 37 and at a big firm, if he doesn’t have the insight to know you can’t afford his style then he’s a bit out of touch.

161,"Happens in Dallas every goddamn Wednesday night.  A long time ago the straights decided to declare Wednesday night ""Straight Night"" at the gay dance club (Village Station, now known as Station 4 or S4).  Most behave and recognize where they are but there are some who get bitchy when hit on or worse, they will pretend to be gay and act all interested in one of the older gents to get drinks bought for them all night and when the guy suggests going back to his place the the guy either bails or says he's straight.  "
162,Easy one star rating there. 
163,"It takes a long long time. If you think you’ve done everything you can to salvage the situation, then just let him go for a bit. Spend time with your friends and family, other people, and set some goals. 

Spend lots of time on yourself, enjoying yourself and improving yourself. Do all the things you wanted to that he didn’t want to. Keeping busy will take your mind off him. Eventually he’ll see how amazing you are. Or someone else will. Maybe even both. 

In all honesty I think the most straightforward way to get over someone is to find someone better. I know it’s easier said than done, but after spending time on yourself for a while, go on a date. It will help you realise he’s not actually everything to you, you’re more than capable of being a strong independent man who don’t need no man, and maybe he was just holding you back. "
164,"Just slap them in the face and say ""be gentle bitch you're not peeling a carrot here, show some feelings"""
165,I think most people know they are gay when puberty hits and we go through a sexual awakening.  Its more about coming to terms with the fact we can't change it and learning to love ourselves for who we are than actual realization that we aren't straight.
166,Hold onto your bf. He’s got magic bowels. 
167,We’ve been dating for two weeks now (we’re also long distance). 
168,"There are two mutually exclusive possibilities here:

&amp;#x200B;

Possibility 1:  The dude is not straight. Bi, gay, call it whatever you want. He's consistently displaying behaviors that really only follow from romantic attachment. If you suspect this is the case, do not force him into a corner where he has to admit he's not straight. Casually physically escalate when the time feels right. Again, I highly suggest NOT having an explicit conversation about it. If he's identified himself as straight I don't think he's ready. Use physical touch instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Possibility 2:  The dude is straight and feels 0 remorse using you as an emotional crutch. He doesn't shy away from leading you on and abusing your sexual/romantic orientation to gain a loyal friend. If you suspect this is the case, I would begin putting some walls up. Continuing this dynamic has the potential to devastate your emotional wellbeing and your future outlook on human relationships (if your attachment to him is strong enough)."
169,i love being hydrated and having clear pee

174,I care more about the look/aesthetic than the size
175,"Due to some career luck, I have had a great salary from a young age. I often date more artistic / creative guys who usually don’t make a lot of money, so I’ve been in this position in almost every relationship. Here are some things I do that help:

If we go out, whoever suggested the place offers to pay.  Suggest how ever often you want. Take me to dive bars all the time please. Or let me pick all the time.

Travel is usually a gift, or I offer the hotel and air at least. Or, to even things out, remember that travel planning is tough and really well planned trips are better, so trade help in planning, research, or other things that aren’t money contributions. 

Splitting things on income percentages sucks because it forces you to stare at the disparity all the time. Instead I try to pick separate responsibilities. When I lived with a guy, I paid the rent and he paid the utilities, which worked out the same, but felt better. It also split the workload since we each just didn’t deal with some expenses. 

Remember that everyone has lots on non monetary needs. “I’ll get dinner, but in exchange I want to be the big spoon tonight” or “can you pick me up from the airport, and I’ll get dinner afterwards?” Everyone needs something and everyone needs to contribute, but these things don’t have to be in the same areas all the time. 

A relationship is about how strong two people are together. It’s a privilege to contribute from your places of strength, and resources are one of those. Also remember what you need and show vulnerability in the places you need someone too. 

Talk about this. It affects the way a relationship works. Lots of people I’ve dated have never had money, don’t know what to do, and don’t even really know what having money means and doesn’t mean. Lots of talking. Remember that this is a good thing for both of you, but it’s only as good as what you make work. Keep it a positive but focusing on what you can make happen together. 

Some people like to live rough. Not every lifestyle is for everyone. Sometimes a relationship doesn’t work out even if you do these things. That person just may not be for you. "
176,"No. I do get waves of depression from things unrelated to sexuality, such as my general incompetence."
177,Too lazy for blowjobs but have sex 3 times a week? Damn

182,"Either way, buying someone a drink doesn’t entitle you to fucking them"
183,"I don't mean to be rude, but he blocked you, so you should just move on. "
184,Definitely double barrel! 
185,"&gt; If you say you feel, for instance, unsafe being in the same space with him, they’re practically guaranteed to move you.

Which is, itself, kinda bullshit. The roommate should be the one who has to move, since they created the unsafe environment...

I agree this is how some universities in the US deal with this (at least, this is how the University of Northern Iowa dealt with this), because my friend's roommate kept writing slurs on their dorm room white board, and my friend felt unsafe, so the university moved him to a private room, instead of moving the other guy or kicking him out of campus housing. "

188,"Are they even still around, Bert and Ernie?"
189,He sounds racist. He dated you because he thought you were white. 
190,"""You are a girl with extra parts.""

Umm, no. I'm a guy."
191,I know he's straight and nothing will happen - Hahahahaha You would be surprised 
192,"I'm gonna give a pretty detailed picture of how it was for me and I warn it's somewhat *NSFW*

I was in constant denial. I always wondered why I had no interest in girls and, yet, sometimes was interested in boys, but I'd always tell me it was just a phase

The denial was so big that I didn't watch porn until my 20s, maybe because straight porn tends to be oriented to heterossexual males. This might be a little weird but in my teens, I had never had a self-inducted orgasm, ie, I couldn't masturbate to that point because I avoided porn and thinking about guys

I always thought I couldn't ejaculate because of a self-steem problem, the bad part is that this led me to having [wet dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal_emission) at least once a month, so I would randomly wake up all dirty.

There was a random time of my life I decided to try to explore my sexuality and, a while later, I decided to watch porn to try seeing if I could finally reach orgasm. It was a video with Russians in a party having a gangbang that was on Redtube at the time and, since it was amateur, it ended up showing a lot of the guys too

After the first orgasm, I started jerking off regularly and I started growing bared of the straight stuff, since I was only looking at the guys anyway. So I decided to try the gay section and it was nice, but, for me, ""this doesn't mean I'm gay, it's just a phase"". One year later I start getting a little worried but two years later I was like ""well, I might as well admit because it seems that this is most definetely not a phase""

Funny thing is that, as a teenager, I'd aways be curious about how my male friends looked like naked and all and I had a few male crushes. It's actually surprising how much it took me to accept myself, I can only imagine how much opportunities I lost because of that, but it's a good thing that I'm ok with myself now :)

**EDIT:** And I guess I didn't mention why I was so much in denial, I always thought being gay was wrong and unnatural, being raised in a conservative family always happened. I legit thought that if I was, this meant that there was something wrong with me and it was super frustrating. I was one of those guys who never had ""anything against homossexuals, but..."" and I also was not super sold on same-sex marriage, because I thought it went against nature (facepalm). It was a very harshy journey for me and I can only imagine how many could be in a similar situation

Sometimes I think if only someone told me it was okay to be how I am sooner, things could have been much easier for me. I don't think many people understand how hard it can be for some of us. I was always the kind that liked to disagree with others (my reddit name is a big clue of that, it's Portuguese for ""the_controversial) but, deep down, I always wanted to fit in and I thought being gay wouldn't allow me to fit in. Phew, it was a huge relief getting that off my chest, thanks for reading :)"
193,Indeed we need to appreciate ourselves for who we are and not set unrealistic standards for ourselves. Each one of us has a quality entirely unique to ourselves!
194,Most of my friends are straight. I’m just one of the guys to them. A few of them are a little weird about the fact that I’m more mechanically inclined than they are.  
195,Anyone else thinks this reads like some fiction novel?
196,My ex and I did this a lot. We called it sexomnia - both were having kinky dreams and would get jiggy with little memory in the morning. Sometimes we'd wake up mid-session. If it's fun don't worry about it :-)
197,"If only all parents act this way!! The only thing I’d add is to ask him if there’s a certain person he’s interested in. I’d imagine we would ask who she was if it were a girl. 

Take an active interest in his “love” life. It’ll help him focus on his aspiring beau and it’ll show him you truly care. "
198,There is nothing more to say then thank you for being such a terrific father. The nuance and tact with which you handled this is incredible; your son is lucky to have you in his life. 
199,He's a hooker. Not that there's anything wrong with that. 
200,"I have never been dead set on anal as the only kind of intimacy.
Cuddling and making out is very intimate to me. I prefer it more than fucking after a long days work.
Has always been this way since I was in my teens. 



... And I'm also into a huge variety of kinks and they get me off too. Anal is just a very small part of my sex life (when I have one). 

With that being said. I'd still prefer cuddling with a hairy beefy (not ripped) scruffy guy over anything else. "
201,He's your boyfriend after one kiss?
202,"I never know how to react when someone calls me attractive

It doesn't happen much"
203,Understanding is always appreciated. Read on. 
204,"Shit, I live alone, and I still close my bathroom door when I'm douching."
205,I have a problem with breathing water. I find it generally detrimental to my continued health and happiness if attempted for long periods of time
206,Stop clocking Delta Work like that
207,"I'm a bartender, it happens all the time. I also see them use it to try to cut lines and walk through crowds. "
208,"Stay safe, but stand your ground. Don't take any shit from him, but be smart so he doesn't hurt you or anything "
209,"Oh fuck them, that's one of the shittiest things I've heard of in a long time. Like wow, at that point I'm sure that's it's happened to them in reverse with women that weren't interested in them and they want to make it up to their own egos by doing it to someone else."
210,Not usually. I think it’s moreso the whole “I’m a vegan” or “I do CrossFit” type of thing. 
211,"Yes. Just always be honest and communicate with the guy. 

Edit: And practice safe sex. Use a condom."
212,"Just tell him you can't afford it. There is no upside to sitting down later and saying you can't pay your bills due to the dates you went on with him. Just imagine how much guilt he will have.
You might come to an agreement you haven't thought about.

Propose cheap dates, organise the dates yourself so you can adjust them to your budget. "
213,Because I’m on Prep so I don’t need condoms lolz!
214,Yes you should.  It’s not appropriate to answer the door in your underwear.  It’s even worse if you summoned the person to your house.
215,"This sounds more like something people fantasize about happing, or create fables about in an attempt to make some sort of point."
216,"This is huge, one of my favorite things of being gay is the deconstruction it brings to the table!"
217,"No ones high school experience is like what you see on tv. For everyone it was mostly the same.  Your social life was friend’s basement, some snack food and video games; your sex life was jerking off to that memory of when you dry humped someone; and partying is when five of you split a six pack or took like two hits off a joint that one time when someone’s brother was home from college. "
218,"All my roommates complain about having to pay for girls when they go out, and my BF and I split everything which is nice. We can borrow each other's cloths. I also just think it's easier for me to understand guys since I am one."
219,"Honestly, I’m surprised I’ve ever had sex and that the people I had sex with wanted to do it again, like ?????? Am I actually attractive to them wtf "
220,was marriage something you had talked about beforehand? had you not gauged his interest in the response before ever asking the question?
221,"dude, sex with him just became *so* much hotter"
222,"For me, intimacy between two guys is the apex of male bonding."
223,"I damn forgot to close it. I was 100% convinced I would be alone, so I felt safe."
224,"Agreed.  All of my straight friends who are more handsome love it when gays eye fuck them, it’s validation.  The ugly ones are phishing."
225,"Absolutely not, but knowingly using someone whose attention you’ve got to buy you drinks while making him think he’s got a chance so he buys you more even though you know he doesn’t have a chance is vile. 

If someone buys you a drink, you don’t owe him anything. But we all know why he bought you a drink so unless he’s being creepy or inappropriate, it would be nice to treat him like a human being and say something like “thanks but I’m not interested” or at least not fuel his interest. "
226,"Yeah it doesn't always go that way, I sucked off my best friend when we were both 15 and he suddenly turned super religious, despite not being from a religious family. I blew him to Jesus. He's now a baptist minister and we are no longer in contact. "
227,"Y'know..... I was under for leg surgery a couple years ago and I thought my surgeon was hot too.

I didn't know this kind of thing was possible, lol. But I'm happy my subconscious spared me the embarrassment."
228,"If someone saying no to you after a marriage proposal results in you asking yourself if life is worth living, you've got bigger problems on your hand. "
229,"I don’t think you were too harsh, but don’t expect anything coming from him and most importantly: don’t feel like you are responsible for someone else’s change. It’s sad to admit it but for all we know he might go his whole life feeling sorry for himself and there’s nothing you can say or do to make him feel happier about his life. The change can only come from within."
230,I always think poor guy.  He probably hasn’t gotten a decent blow job in ages...if ever.  And he certainly hasn’t gotten a good rimming. If only he knew....
231,That is awesome! I love hearing about straight people coming through for us. Helps restore some faith in humanity.
232,"Why avoid him? It's clear that neither one of you are interested in each other, so just move on like nothing happened."
233,Don’t let this crazy asshole move in with you. 
234,"Kisses and cuddles pretty much every time we hang out, sex about 3 times a week, blowjobs are kinda rare basically when we're too tired/lazy for sex "
235,"I disagree, when you factor in prep and cleanup for sex I'd say a blowjibber is way easier"
236,"I'm good, I don't wreck relationships. "
237,"You are doing fantastic. Love him and let him know it’s fine whenever the time comes.

- Sincerely, a teen who was not loved by his father when it came to this. 
"
238,"Uhhh... hmmm, I actually don’t have that many. I guess my worst is when our whole town had a blackout in the middle of a summer thunderstorm. My bf and I were watching the lightning on he front porch when he starts to get handsy, then he’s in my pants and pulling his dick out. Ended up blowing him on our porch with the only light being the thunder going off. Never was into exhibitionism but it was a little exhilarating "
239,« asking Face full of fist » for gay guys hitting on you at a gay bar sure doesn’t sound homophobic...
240,"Honestly it’s ridiculous, albeit hilarious, to look back and have not realized I was gay much earlier. But it’s also weirdly comforting to know I’m not the only one who went through this. "
241,"I usually compliment people that I think are struggling with their self image, while I do think they look actually good. It doesn’t mean I wanna date them, but yeah that is just me. Anyhow, whatever the outcome is, know that you are beautiful! "
242,"If someone explicitly says ""no taps pls"" I will tap them 100% "
243,"What is he, fucking stupid?  It's easy to have a good idea how much money someone earns if you have any interest in the other person at all.  Does he have no fucking clue how you spend your time or where you work?  Of course he does, but he's a cheap fuck for not paying most of the cost despite knowing it's a big burden for you.  He's using you as a boytoy.   Tell him you can't afford it as a minimum but honestly you should just dump him.  He's a cheap materialistic Dick on the hunt for young bussy ie. You."
244,"Never. Women do not find me attractive. Thank god I'm gay. If I was straight, I'd be a 0/10. I'm a 4/10 because guys will fuck anything. "
245,Haha patient zero 
246,Ya. He's about as straight as the earth is flat. 
247,"First, you are a GOOD FRIEND!  He’s been through a lot, and you’re giving him a much needed break from that.  

Next...Already giving him a conscious choice by sleeping on the couch that first time in your bed and then suggesting (even in a joke way) a barrier is a solid heads up for him that you don’t want to make it weird for him.  IMO it says, “I respect you but I am gay so forgive me when nature takes over”.

I don’t think you should feel pervy BUT if it’s really digging at you give him a new layer of the “what’s up”.  Like, heeeey friend I just want you to know I’m not gonna go “there” but groggily I woke up with a hottie in my bed and I got a rager before I snapped to and realized it was you.  That you don’t want him to wake up and feel a certain way because nature took over.  He’s got a dick and (what seems like) enough sensibility that he knows that sort of unconscious boner happens.

It’s if you start catching feelings that you need to push for some changes if you want to keep the friendship.  Help get him to the next level of whatever, where he can have a job and his own place.  Because you aren’t going to be able to meet someone and start a relationship when you’re into him or even trying to explain that you sleep with a straight dude in your bed every night.  "
248,Sensuous cuddles and all like things are the best part of being gay.
249,"I had it the other way around. Loved men since... 12?, had no opinion on dick until maybe 15-16. "
250,If I had a way to reach back out I would. We hooked up weeks ago through scruff. I haven't seen his profile up since. He has a very noticeable chest tattoo. So I would know if I saw him. 
251,They’re good friends I guess? 
252,"Yeah, it's kinda like standing on a train track and complaining about noise and discomfort. "
253,"Congratulations! As long as you enjoyed yourself and were safe, that's what counts! And apparently, you were a pretty gifted virgin if you got him to cum twice..."
254,"Wait, there are people out there who wear pants inside their houses? I don't understand. "
255,"I love muscly guys, and I go to the gym myself with the specific aim of building muscle. I do not have anything remotely close to the kind of bodybuilder body I'm talking about when I say ""I love muscly guys"".

And because of that disparity, whenever a guy tells me he likes *my* muscles, I nearly always laugh, because it doesn't make sense to me.

 #isthisbodydysmorphia"
256,It would be better if you don't tell the other kid's parents.
257,Every day. My hand loves the cock.
258,I think gay guys are way more picky than women. That’s likely the reason we have slang names for body types as opposed to women who can a lot of the time just be indecisive. Plus most gay guys are picky about trivial things like a small age gap of two years or stuff like that. That’s what I’ve noticed at least 
259,Breeding eh? Hmm
260,That sentence about breathing is why deepthroating is awesome. 
261,Read that last sentence and dreams were crushed. 
262,"I’ve been down that road with a few people. The issue is not you. He’s fighting with feelings he doesn’t understand and/or fully accept. This is not about him being gay with you, it’s about him being gay with himself. He’s having a hard time coming to terms with something he may or may not want. Continue to be his friend, let him vent when he needs to, and if he wants to continue with you, let him take the lead. "
263,"He is the first person to tell you he loved but he he won't be the last, I promise you that at least. You do deserve more than a phone call. Anyone deserves more than a phone call to end a relationship. Don't worry or over think too much about it stuff like this happen and time will help you get over him. "
264,No because my name is also my dad’s name.
265,"No this is happening now. Every Sunday I’ll make a wholesome post and I’ll encourage the bros here to make wholesome post that talk about positive behavior changes in their life and self compassion. Good idea alienwpopcorns, keep the good ideas a-rollin. "
266,I mean... it’s not like you’re going to get pregnant.. sooo roll rainbow tide? 
267,"Had a guy in our unit in the military who had a birthday. He was gay and asked us to go to a gay bar with him. I have never felt prettier. It was a blast, getting hit on, getting drinks bought for me, etc. I always told the guys showing me attention I was straight and I was there for our friends birthday. But goddamn, gay guys know how to make a man feel special.

"
268,"Average is fine. I don’t mind thick. But anything long is kinda uncomfortable in general when intercourse is involved. 

Honestly though if he knows what he’s doing there shouldn’t be a problem. "
