Even if you have to answer it, or answer it by accident, just hang up. Don't hear them out or fuck with them or call them names. Otherwise you give them reasons to call you with new scams or add you to every list they have access to.

Idk why I'm getting downvoted for saying this. People just love fucking with scammers, even to their own detriment I guess. "

"If I had to guess, I'd bet that they have enough employees to cover it. Most of these calls are from organizations overseas with call centers, not individuals. And of they are an individual, then presumably the auto-dialer halts when they're on the phone, and will just pick up where it left off after the call is done.

The real solution to this problem isn't to waste their time, because their time is pretty worthless. The solution is to harass and waste your government representatives' time because they're the ones who can actually get momentum going to find a solution. Also your service provider needs to be made aware. The more complaints they get the more they'll do to address it. Even though they won't be able to do anything for specific cases, it will pressure them to invent some tech to solve it. "

"The reason anonymous automated calls like this are still even possible is because the telecom industry in the US has not spent any money upgrading their protocols for security. Why would they? The regulatory bodies that would normally demand it are very captured.

"In college I stumbled home drunk many of times. Always made it back home safe and sound before letting the demons out of me. I lived with 7 other guys who were all great friends, and we had a key code to our top floor apartment. One night during finals week I was at the library until about 1am studying. Under no influence but sleep deprivation, I tried to use our key code on the floor below ours. Obviously didn't work, kept trying and got frustrated. I'm thinking, ""the guys don't care if I just ring our door bell, they will understand."" So that's what I do, and some dude I barely recognized answers and gives me a weird look. I share this weird look and wonder what he is doing in our apartment. It dawns on me after about 10 seconds that I just rang the doorbell to another apartment that has 8 other dudes sleeping before finals. I stammer for a bit and the best thing I could come up with is ""You live here"" *points at him*, ""I live up there"" *points up*. Then I proceed to go up the rest of the stairs. He definitely thought I was fucked up."

This entire thing isn't about protecting kids, it's about controlling our internet and what they want us to see, monitoring what we do and no one seems to care. They started this years ago with their shoddy porn filter. When not enough people signed up they made companies turn it on so we had to opt out manually (it was blocking reddit, but my ex could still access his normal porn sites), now it's on for all new customers and it still isn't good enough. I'm not sure why they're getting so bent out of shape over what porn people watch. Some things should be banned, I agree, but why not use the money they're wasting on adding extra police to the streets, give it to schools to better their education, fix pot holes, feed and house the homeless or any other number of things that need their attention and leave the damn internet alone. I'm not arguing for the porn, I couldn't give a damn about it honestly. I'm just pissed were losing our freedoms online step by step and most people just don't seem to care.

"Okay, so wild theory time. They know they're doing something immoral, and that doesn't pass in the human adrenal system neutrally. Lying stresses people out, as well as guilt, and their brain is going to be banging alarms with adrenaline and cortisol.

I had this batman toy that was supposed to stick to windows, but mum didn't want it to leave a mark so I wasn't allowed to stick it to anything. My uncle decided to visit. He would have been probably in his early 30s and got the idea to stick the thing to his forehead. Well it stuck really well and we had a giggle. When he pulled it off, it left a huge red mark. Of cause I found this hilarious and proceeded to stick it to my own forehead, which left a nice red mark as well. My mum called us idiots when she found out what we had done. I had a red mark for a few days, my uncle did as well. "

"Honestly, if this kid wanted to fight back, he could have REPEATEDLY told everyone how the teacher privately “called me a pedophile.” It’s not great for adults to use the p-word, privately, to kids. Maybe explain how you don’t even know what that word means, and how it really upset and confused you, being called such a word by an adult. And the teacher then has to choose to reply with “no, I said it makes him LOOK LIKE a...” and the teacher really looks like a jerk. But this kid seems like a good honest middle schooler, and the teacher’s response may have been a bit emotional, but I don’t think it’s too unfair. I admire the kid for being accountable for his actions. "

I’m gonna call BS on that. I pulled 2 days detention for getting into a fistfight in middle school. Why’s a kahoot name (that the teacher didn’t instantly kick anyways) buying 5 days? 
"Hey, back in 9th grade my friend got suspended, I kid you not, for high giving someone roughly. For two weeks.

The teacher heard a very loud slap, looked over, and started yelling at him because he thought he slapped my other friend.
