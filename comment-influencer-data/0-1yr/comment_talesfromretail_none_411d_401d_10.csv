"FYI:  bettas need warm, clean, filtered water just like any other tropical fish.   "
I was sure she would have set off the door sensors as she left.
Moral of the story: don't go in with the person buying your booze for you.
"Thank you for saying this. They can *survive* in worse conditions, but they certainly won't thrive. I hate seeing those stupid betta starter kits."
So basic. Underage drinking 101.
What a petty person. Why do people act like they are better than retail workers?
"&gt; Guy: YOU MUST BE NEW HERE! I ALWAYS TREAT THE GIRLS LIKE THIS HAHA-

‚Äú...Then you are now banned, sir.  Get out and don‚Äôt come back."
"&gt;Sorry I tried to save you money???

Please say it this way!"
"Where I work at in the Us, our older generation still use checks and are terrified of debit cards(which pull from the same damn account). üôÑüòÇ"
That‚Äôs a shoplifter
"I work at the customer service counter so I've heard a few of the silly return stories.  Here's two of my faves

Lady calls saying she bought some weight loss supplements from us and she didn't like them. Well that's fine as we return almost anything. Like it has to be seriously messed for us to not. So I tell her this but she informs me that she took all of the supplements. So she just wanted to return the empty bottle, ""But the lady told me I could return them."" Well you could of you didn't take the whole bottle, silly woman.

The next story is similiar to yours. I answer the phone and a man asks if he could return a shirt, I ask the normal question such as receipt, if they used a card, etc. He says that there was a stain on it and I said that's no problem. If the stain was there when he bought it (and really even if it wasn't I'm not gonna push it, I don't really care.) he could replace it with the same shirt.  He is like oh well it actually is pizza sauce I dumped it all down the front of my shir, I grit my teeth like you did and start to think of what I can do. He starts laughing and then he let's me know that it's my dad joking. I never realized he was joking. "
"""You should stand by your product!""

It can get confusing to people that don't work in retail, but for a lot of businesses it's not *our* product. A lot of store don't manufacture anything, they just sell it to the public. Manufacturer sells product to retailer in bulk prices, retailer sells individual product to the public at a mark up. Retailer offers short term solutions, but the manufacturer is the one who backs the product. Why doesn't the manufacturer sell directly to the public? Because they don't want the hassle of guys like this dingus showing up and calling the cops when the customer doesn't get their way. "
"&gt; Lady 1: Wtf? You can't do this!

""Not only *can* I, the law says that I *have to*."""
"Yeah, OP missed a golden opportunity to leave one still attached. "
"Bettas actually do not require a lot less care. A minimum of a five gallon tank, a heater, a filter, and they love it to be densely planted with lots of hideyholes. Check out /r/bettafish for more info but they are a beautiful albeit semi expensive hobby. Having one one fish per tank can get to the point of having 3-5 tanks in your house and constantly checking your water levels and everything. "
Four bean is one bean better!
"I love this so much! I was a children‚Äôs specialist for a bookstore for 3 years and this story is all too familiar for me :) 

I love it when parents/grandparents put their trust in you to put a suitable book in their kid‚Äôs hands. I encountered so many people who thought they knew what their kid should be reading, and looked at books like Captain Underpants and Minecraft graphic novels as trash, and not a ‚Äògood book‚Äô because it‚Äôs got pictures or it‚Äôs not a classic. I always had to explain that kids want to read about what they want to read about, and it‚Äôs better for them to read that ‚Äòcrap‚Äô than to read nothing at all. 

Go you! I‚Äôm glad you had such a wonderful customer experience. "
"Also work at a big box home improvement store. The second people say ‚ÄúI‚Äôve spent thousands of dollars here,‚Äù I stop giving a fuck. Everyone says that, and it‚Äôs not going to get you special treatment. "
"I'm not kidding when I say I used to work at a gigantic entertainment store that rhymes with croc duster... And when I had buy 2 get 1 free sales on previously viewed movies people  Would come up with only 2 movies, And I would tell them OK I will hold them and you can go pick out a free one and they would say no thanks and I would tell them again you're literally gonna walk out paying for two and not get a free one?  It still didn't seem to click so then I said OK can I go get a free one and just charge it on yours and I'll get to keep it?  That's when they were like oh OK let me go look."
Do an update for when she comes back in three days and screams about her bread
[deleted]
I know you keep all the secret signage and secret coupons *in the back* with all the stock you're hoarding!
"‚ÄúWHY DIDNT YOU CALL ME AND TELL ME MY BREAD WAS READY?!?!‚Äù

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam you never gave us your number‚Äù

‚ÄúIT DOESNT MATTER IF I DID OR NOT YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED ME AND TOLD ME‚Äù"
"I'm a cashier and even if someone is buying one small thing I still have to ask them if they want a bag for it. So once a lady bought a canvas bag and I asked if she wanted a bag. She said in a very joking voice, ""yes I want a bag for my bag."" I didn't catch on and started bagging her bag, so she quickly stopped me. When she saw that she rolled her eyes and said, ""God some people actually do, don't they?"""
"&gt; That's surprising, considering in New Zealand we have a culture around being asshats to retail workers.

That's an international sport at this point. I'm surpised the IOC hasn't decided to make it an event. :p"

Really nice dude though. Congrats on the fifty"
I feel like your response definitely **was** the right one.
"Most definitely. 

I was trying to figure out how she was using the children clothes as a decoy. Expected one of the security tags to accidently be left on by all her snatching of the clothes, and that security tag would become the decoy for all the clothes she is trying to steal in her purse possibly. But that didn't happen so I'm stumped unless she was just casing the store and checking boundaries. 

She's definitely a shoplifter though. 

This is the time of year professional boosters are out and about most. "
"I wanted to downvote him for a second, but realized that I'd be downvoting you.

I hate people like him."
"&gt;Guy: YOU MUST BE NEW HERE! I ALWAYS TREAT THE GIRLS LIKE THIS HAHA

Yes, because it's totally awesome to be known as the regular customer who treats women like trash and is a yelling, demanding curmudgeon. /s"
"&gt; She looks at me in disgust and gives me the most sarcastic, condescending ""have a nice day"" and drives off.

I'm disgusted (though not surprised) that she asked to be refunded over such a tiny spill."
I would have 100% left tags on.
"Once.  Just one time for the exchange.  If they were wrong, he should have noticed immediately (I smoke, I would never mistake my brand with the wrong ones, that's, just dumb!  So, fine, he didn't, but he sent in his friend??  Why? ""You already messed up once, I'm not gonna let you mess it up again."". So friend fucks it up, whatever.  But there IS NO FUCKING WAY I'm walking out with menthol if I don't smoke menthol!  Something weird going on here.  (BTW, if you don't already know, green on smokes always means menthol.  I'll ask ""*Brand* menthol? "" like accent the MENTHOL...?)"
"Sorry you had to deal with that ahole, OP. I'm an Australian just about to turn 72 &amp; much prefer paypass, especially the tablet-type systems, for both my convenience &amp; that of the store staff. It's almost painful now to have to swipe or insert a credit card."
"""The customer is always right."" Yeah, right.

Of all the sayings in the world, this is one that I would gladly strike from the permanent record. I used to do customer service training courses, and replaced this with ""the customer is not always right, but they are always the customer"". Worked a charm, taking the view of customer-on-a-pedestal down to something people could manage. 

&amp;nbsp;

*Edit:* ~~pedastal~~, damnit."
You mean those little fuckin tupperware container lookin things that have about enough room inside them for the fish to turn in place?
"Where I live we‚Äôre not allowed to exchange cigarettes. Saves a lot of arguing, and I always tell people to be 150% sure that they‚Äôre getting the kind they want."
Yeah my sister took in the last tatty little beta the shop we normally buy cat litter was selling (and they were never getting more in)... and we upgraded that guy to a 10gal with plants and a heater and filter and all sorts of nice things. He was a great fish! His name was Mr. Fish and he would come up to the tank to greet you and dance. :)
"Because it's part of the service industry. We all know those workers are just lazy, leeching off the government and unwilling to pull themselves up by the bootstraps! ^^^^/s             

^^^^I ^^^^hate ^^^^myself ^^^^for ^^^^even ^^^^writing ^^^^that"

"I love reading wholesome stories here, they recharge my faith in humanity. Hope your wedding goes well and you have a great day :)"
"If a store runs out of a sale item, sometimes they will offer to honor the sale price at a later time when the item becomes available again. 
The term comes from baseball. If a game is rained out, anyone who has purchased tickets for the game would be issued a ""rain check"", or voucher for free admittance to a future game."
Ive worked at this store for just over a year now and I've only had a total of 5 cheques. And three of those were the same person. The other two were reluctantly using them because their body corporate (like HOAs) refused to get a company credit card. 
"I had to process a return for a woman once who was upset that a bunch of baby clothes she bought had tiny, barely-visible holes in the neck from the pins on our security tags.

Her response to being told that all the clothes were security tagged to protect against shoplifting was: ""Is that because this store is in [small city known for being trashy and full of drug addicts]? We don't have that problem in [largest city in the entire country that most definitely does have a bigger shoplifting problem than our store]."" I had no idea how to respond to that."
"This reminds me of when I was a kid, my dad rented a movie one weekend afternoon and we ended up watching it as soon as we got home. It was still early so dad and I walked back to the video rental store to return the tape, but he tried to spin some BS about how he had already rented that movie on another occasion and forgot about it, to try to get out of paying the rental fee. (We had been customers for several years so the store people would usually waiver the fee if we rented the same movie twice by mistake.) 9-year-old me just went ""No dad, we just watched this movie at home now! Don't you remember??"" I'll never forget his dirty look..."
"She just wants a fish or two on the counter, and doesn't want them in a container to keep them alive.

Lady is eating Bettas, confirmed."
"&gt; The dude was super nice and quite shocked that I hadn‚Äôt caught on that he was joking straight away. 


Oh sweet summer child. 

That person is someone who's never had to deal with customers in any retail/support fashion. "
