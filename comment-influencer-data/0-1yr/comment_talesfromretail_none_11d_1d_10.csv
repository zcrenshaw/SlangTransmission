Almost sounds like she had a dementia moment.
Was it a Medicalert bracelet? I've seen people bring those to be repaired.
"Maybe, early on-set dementia? She looked like she was in her 30s or 40s though."
"Yeah, cause.....75 years ago they might have repaired it?"
r/talesfromthepharmacy might like this too.
Nope. We replace broken Medicalert bracelets not repair them. She had a charm bracelet with one of those little lockets.
"I do that sometimes but it is because I want a new trash bag for the car since I just trashed the other one while putting gas in.   
Never saw it as a big deal,at my PT retail job I offer a bag for any purchase.   Sometimes people look at me like ‚Äúseriously?‚Äù and I‚Äôm just like ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know if you needed more trashbags for the small cans.   
Of course i‚Äôm in small rural town and have never met anyone that uses actual trashbags in bathroom type trashcans.   
Everybody keeps a bag full of bags,but in my area they tend to have defined purposes.   
I don‚Äôt care why they want bag or if they even purchased anything,here ya go and hope it serves you well.   
First thing I thought when reading OPs story was ‚Äúthose cell phone places have those nice thick bags too! I bet he‚Äôs going on a picnic or something and needed a good strong one!‚Äù"
She forgot she was there for meds.
"Yep, I've had people need a bag for 1 pack of cigarettes when they've got a purse, pockets, their hands, etc.

I think some people just feel like they need to get more out of you since they've paid for something. Like, I've graced your store with my purchase, reward me with a bag."
"(comes back a month later) ""I was just here last week and it was on sale! Why did you mark it back up???"""
Oooh! I did not know that sub existed. Thanks for sharing!
"She probably just got confused, but i'm glad it sounds like she didn't get to upset at you."
Same with landlords.
"I once had a lady come into my store and wanted me to ship a package for her.  I work for a storage facility and I explained that to her.  She told me that I could because I had the same ‚Äúwe sell boxes‚Äù sign outside our door as one of those small UPS stores.  

I told her no, it‚Äôs a sign and if she needed moving boxes I could help her.  She then went off on me and said that UPS must deliver here so therefore I could just hand her package off to them.  I asked her how long she was willing to wait, because UPS doesn‚Äôt always come around, and we don‚Äôt get our deliveries from them.  She kept arguing with me until she realized she was going nowhere and told me that my customer service sucks. 

Yeah ok lady."
"Omg at my local pharmacy (I‚Äôm a cashier) we used to have old guys coming in all the time wanting their watch batteries replaced. If you know anything about watches, you‚Äôll know that it‚Äôs REALLY FREAKING HARD to get the covers off to replace the battery. Apparently because we sell watch batteries they think we can change it for them. I just tell them to go to a jeweler or something. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd do it for free or barely nothing anyways."
"Ever heard the term ""Horse and Buggy""??? Calling something a buggy goes a lot further back than shopping carts and dune buggies."
Might have been a jewellery shop once? Or she got turned around and thought she was on another street?
"reminds me of on MASH

Hawkeye: why can't we have an incubator here so we can run our own test?

Nurse: because that would save time and effort and would make sense."
"If you work for the corner of happy and healthy, I used to get that all the time from older customers...but I worked in the photo lab. People also thought that was the pharmacy too many times."
It's all you really can do tbh. I mean I'm a cashier at a grocery store and have the capacity to override prices but I'm not gonna do it cause you thought your bottle of hot sauce was 20 cents too much lol.
"Ya I'm guilty of having a bag of bags and use them for little trash cans at home. But most people just ask for an empty bag and don't have me place they're stuff in it then. Where I'm at though we have to be careful about this type of thing bc people will take the extra bag and walk back in the store, fill it up with product and walk out..."
"""Lady, I'm pretty sure they don't make a pill for that."""
I would too it was just the weirdest interaction start to finish. This short snippet doesnt really encapture how awkward it was and this was the cherry on top it blew my mind.
"Having worked many years in customer service,  I interpret that as 'I've had to look after my kid over the holiday, and now I've been given the task of getting him shoes when I could be in the pub garden with my mates. Instead of examining why I apparently resent spending time with my own child I'm going to complain at a blameless droid over nothing. '"
"**Lesson #0.1** People will not only not read, they will go out of their way to remove or bypass a sign or barricade, without reading it, if it is impeding them from their desired behavior."
Using the management excuse works so well cause 9/10 times your customer will be working some kind of job and who doesn't have at least a thing or two against their manager/higher ups?
Might've brought family there to fix the medicalert bracelet or misinterpreted a sign and assumed it was all bracelets
"Things I wish people to be more aware of:

&amp;#x200B;

* Make sure your complaint is actually valid, not an opinion. There is a difference.
* When Complaining, ensure that the person can do something about your problem. Otherwise, you're flagellating yourself of being powerless and reminding the recipient of their inability to help.
* When Complaining, be sure that the person cannot actually make your experience worse. What's to stop them from interrupting you from you continuing the mistake?

   (Such as demanding 1/3 off instead of 1/2 because the three sounds like a bigger number. Yes, people can be this stupid.)

* The more polite you are, the more reasonable you sound. Toddler tantrums has no place in polite company."
"So true! Back when I worked retail, my store had a sale on board shorts. The sign said ‚ÄúOn Sale $20.99 (Select styles only)‚Äù. 

A girl had just walked up to the cash register and handed in a job application, very friendly and pleasant. I take it and set it aside for the manager to look at. A few moments I see the same girl browsing at the table that had all of our board shorts displayed. She grabs a pair and comes up to my register, where they rang in at $24.99. So I said ‚Äúlooks like this pair wasn‚Äôt on sale, did you want to grab a different one?‚Äù She yelled at me‚ÄùTHAT‚ÄôS FALSE ADVERTISING!‚Äù I pointed out how the sign said ‚ÄúSelect styles only‚Äù but she didn‚Äôt care, and continued to give me a huge fit before giving up and storming out. I grabbed her job application and ripped it right up."
"If you were in California, he would have paid $.10 for that bag! I wonder if he still would have wanted it."
"Everyone should be required to work in some kind of customer service job at some point during their lives so they can appreciate how to treat others. It would seem that it‚Äôs not rocket science how to be a decent person, but then this sub wouldn‚Äôt have so many stories."
Haha. I‚Äôd give a guy five bags to set up BYOD service. Easiest commission ever.
"I feel your pain. I also work at a Five Below and people get so mad about the price and I just want to be like, ""Go find your Apple charger somewhere else then Karen"". They just grab random things bring them up and then they're like 'Oh I didn't realize it was going to be that much'. And then put back like half or more of what they grab.

Fair warning be prepared for the people who want to buy the oil drums or the wheel barrels and also be prepared for the ones who complain that something that is $5 cost $5.41 after tax."
"I would usually say something like ""Because some guy that makes in a week what I make all year decided so"". It helped I said it with a defeated tone. No one really had a comeback for that one."
In my city there are like two big pharmacy giants. But up until a few years ago there was a drug store/pharmacy that was independent that used to offer all kinds of random services including some jewelry repair
"It's a type of biscuit. Although apparently our biscuits are different to yours, cookies are a type of biscuit. Digestive are a type made of wheat, and you can have them plain, or topped with chocolate

"Someone much higher up the ladder needs to contact this woman and explain all of this to her.

This is above your pay grade."
"honestly.... i just left retail and started working customer service at a vet clinic and people are still just as stupid. had a lady call us and complain she got two $80 parking tickets while she was at our clinic for an appointment. i asked her where she parked, and she said she parked in the railroad commuter lot. which is PLASTERED with signs saying you can only park there with a permit. 

 now, we have a deal with them that lets our clients park there AFTER 3 PM and we have huge signs that say so. like the ""after 3pm"" part isn't fine print, it's in HUGE letters the same size as where it says ""additional parking"" 

this lady parked there at 1pm because we didn't have any spots left in our lot. she wanted me to ""do something"" about her tickets, and she's screaming at me. i had to calmly and politely tell her that she could have parked at any of the free 3hour parking spots on the street, or any of the metered parking around the corner. it wasn't my fault she parked in a clearly marked permit only lot, and that she didn't know how to read a simple sign. ü§¶ of course she told me the sign didn't specify a time, which it clearly does, and i only got her off my case by saying i would ""fix the signs"" but if she wanted to dispute her ticket she had to call the courts."
