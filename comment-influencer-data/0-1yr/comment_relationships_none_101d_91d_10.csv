"He's going to read it Thursday or Friday night? What? 

Okay... ""My girlfriend and partner for the last 8 years is about to leave me. She wrote a post detailing how she is feeling and looking for advice that can possibly help save our relationship. I'll read it in a day or two, or some version of that vague timeline.""

OP, does that sound like a guy who even gives a flying fuck? Come on now, it's not going to happen. 29 is not too old to start over and is still a super fun time in life. I am tjrning 31 later this year and started dating an old friend who I think I'm going to end up marrying. You can find someone else who actually wants to create a life with you."
"Victoria secret underwear have a date on them like month year. Check the tag. Is it 6+ years old? Someone else mentioned checking the elastic in them too, which is also a good idea."
"I’m not sure that you *should* stop having these thoughts about him or your marriage, because you’re absolutely justified in feeling this way. He’s marginalized your career - the same career that was good enough to support him through med school - and expects you to give it up to raise your children... you know, the ones he’s too busy and important to raise himself. 

Have you considered marriage counseling? Does he know how you feel, and why you feel you’ve accommodated his dreams all this time only for yours to be brushed off like this? Does he understand that he’s basically saying that what he wants is more important than what you want is?"
"“Paul and I FaceTimed last night, I know you weren’t with him”"
"He is such a self centred narcisist. Even after you tell him that you have not been happy he still mentions how ""great"" he is and completely dismisses your side of it... you made a good decision leaving him!"
"""I can't control what other people do and it is unfair for you to take out your insecurities on me. If our relationship is going to survive, I need to to learn how to manage your insecurities and trust me."""
"Your other post a few months back was about how he didn't shower enough. Has that improved? Honestly, is he depressed? It might not be about you, it might just be that he's dealing with some depression.

It's also possible that before he viewed you as sex partner and wife and now he views you as mother. A lot of guys struggle with the inability to see the mothers of their kids as both a sexual partner and a maternal one."
"Honestly it sounds to me like she knows exactly what she said and is gauging if you declined her because she was drunk or lack of interest. More times than not in my experience “did I say something embarrassing I was blacked out!” is code for this. Does she usually ask you this after she’s been drunk around you?

I’d have a talk about either way and set things straight. You made a good choice regardless of if you want to sleep together."
"*Then, he turned to her and asked if she wanted to get high! She agreed and they both walked away, leaving me alone with the kids, while they both got high in our garage together!*

And you just... let him? 

Time to confront him."
"He purposely FaceTimed me to show me my boyfriend was with me? 
I didn’t even think of that, thank you for the perspective!"
"Also, thank Paul, he was giving you a heads up ..."
"You can contact your state's bar association about the prosecutor's involvement asap. A prosecutor in my state was prosecuted and disbarred in recent years for using his position to influence court workers on child custody cases for women he was sleeping with (among other awful things like human trafficking, but still, this is taken seriously)."
I would double up on birth control because you guys have way too many issues to sort out in therapy before you ever get pregnant. You can’t stop resenting him until he sees you as an equal partner and since he’s a super important Dr. that’s not going to happen easily apparently.
"&gt; Why is it such a big deal that I don't care. 

Two reasons. One is because ""I don't care, you choose"" gets really fucking old really fucking quickly. It puts the entire onus on the other person to choose where you both eat, what you watch...it's exhausting, and you're basically saying ""I'm so keen to preserve my own emotional energy that I'd rather you sacrifice yours"".

The other reason is because **she's telling you it's a big deal!** I mean this is your wife, who presumably you love and whose feelings you give a shit about, flat out telling me ""I find it annoying that you can never muster up even the pretence of having an opinion"", and your response is...""I don't care, I'm not changing"". Can you not see how *that* would be irritating? She's asking you to care, she's asking you to do a really really simple thing, and you don't give a shit and are refusing to bother.

I mean, why is **this** your hill to die on? Why is it **so** important to you to have no opinion of your own that you're **choosing** to have this argument over and over again? Because you know she feels this way, you know she'll get mad when you, once again, say ""I don't care"". Why not just fake an opnion? Why not just throw out any old place? If you truly don't care, name **literally any place or TV show** and this problem goes away. Instead you voluntarily get into an argument for 2 hours where your wife beats her head against a brick wall and you don't give a shit."
"As a woman in tech you have quite a bit of bias to overcome. You make it harder for yourself (and other women) if you break any of the cardinal rules:

* Don't be the woman who refuses to hire the qualified, bright, pretty, young girl that everyone else likes. If you're going to pass on her, you need to have a damn good work related reason. Even if no one ever kniws about your boyfriend's indiscretion, they will automatically assume it's because of jealousy, etc. Also don't assume the story won't get out. Rejected candidates have been known to spill ALL the dirty laundry to recruiters. In some companies, if they found out you turned down a candidate with whom you had this kind of history, they would reprimand or fire you. My recruiting trainers always emphasized never putting the company at risk during the interview/hiring process.

* Don't ever let your significant other make work decisions for you, it's a fast and sure way to tank your career. Your partner's opinions and needs are important, but they should be limuted in scope and impact (should you take a job/promotion? Yes! Should you fire the office Kevin? Your decision alone). You need to make the best choice for your company and career.

* Don't sabotage your company (i.e. not hiring a great candidate) for personal reasons- especially when it doesn't really bother you. If I interviewed that candidate and then you refused to hire her without a damn good reason, I'd lose respect/trust for your opinion. Plus most people are terrible actors and someone will figure you're hiding your reasons. 

There are more rules, but those seem like the applicable ones here. I understand your boyfriend's perspective, but including his opinion in a hiring decision because he's uncomfortable about his cheater past is a bad, bad, bad, bad idea."
"""K""  
Yeah, my dude. I'd just move on."
"He was probably telling you the truth about them being his exgirlfriends but they were probably from 6 days ago and not 6 years ago. 

The fact that he gave you her number to text probably means he already collaborated with her and told her to tell you the same lie. Who the hell remembers what underwear they had 6 years ago?"
"You cannot room with her.  She is not well and is triggering you. You simply cannot live with her. Please save yourself.

She is unwell and isn't getting the help she needs to be well.  She is quite literally toxic and you need to start limiting your contact a little at a time.  Let her lean on other people and save yourself.

You aren't responsible for her and YOU can make less toxic friends who will like you and not be so manipulative.

It won't make you a bad person to leave a relationship that is bad for you."
"I think your priority right now should be to protect your daughter from your sister. An adult taking their insecurity and jealousy out on someone just starting out in life is just embarrassing and awful.

In your shoes, I would minimize contact as much as possible between your daughter and your sister. As you know, your sister isn't entitled to any percentage of your daughter's earnings. I would be very worried about your sister saying something that could negatively impact your daughter's mindset or knock her confidence in a lasting way.

Your sister should be in therapy. If she isn't, I would try to find a way to tactfully encourage it."
"This sounds almost exactly like a guy I grew up with, so I’m going to give you the advice I wish I could tell his wife: you also get a say in your life together, and a partner who honestly believes they are more valuable than their partner is not someone to spend your life with. I’m not saying you have to abandon ship now, but I am saying that now is absolutely the time to have a conversation about goals and your life together. You are not a terrible person for feeling that you shouldn’t have to set aside everything you want. I can tell you as someone who did discuss and then moved twice with a partner and did want to stay home while our child is little that it is still hard, even with a husband encouraging me to go back to work or do what will make me happy. Definitely hold off on kids until you’re both in agreement. Ask him to see your perspective. Your feelings are valid."
"He sounds incredibly emotionally abusive and controlling. Leaving you on the side of the road? Screaming at you, threatening to embarrass you to your family to keep you in line?

Why are you with this guy? He's not a good father and he's not a good partner. I'd suggest counseling, but it's not a good idea to do that with an abusive partner. You should go on your own, and really consider why you don't think you deserve a better life."
"You seem to missing the actual issue here:

* Your GF chooses to share personal details with her parents that you are not comfortable with.
* Your GF is apparently okay with her father inserting himself into her relationship with you and deliberately intimidating you. (My Dad might have pulled similar shit when I was 12, but not when I was 22.)
* Your GF seems to be insisting on regular dinners with her folks as part of being in a relationship with her.

You don't have a parent issue. The parents are not the problem. 

You have a compatibility issue with this woman. Her views and wishes are the problem."
"My thoughts: a kid who *cut off a kitten's head* with hedge clippers would never, ever, ever be allowed inside my home for a visit, much less invited to live there. He clearly needs institutional care."
"Good for you. Happy endings are when people are happy, not necessarily staying together."
"&gt;I've done everything in this relationship. I asked him out. I told him I  loved him first. I plan our dates. I got us to move in together. I just  wanted him to take initiative on this one thing so that I could feel  like everything wasn't one sided

I'm so sorry you settled for someone who's demonstrated over and over that he's lazy in a relationship"
"Sorry but I'm not sure why you consider the host a friend considering they've excluded you from multiple events.

It sounds like you are kind of in a self-fulfilling spiral where you felt a little social alienation and it got to you and caused you to scrutinize your social interactions more and more and that caused a lot of anxiety which is more alienating and now you're here.

I think therapy would be a good path for you. Work on not needing external validation as much and not taking it so personally when someone isn't pursuing a friendship with you. I understand because I struggle with the same thing, and my therapist has been a godsend in that regard."
You already know why it's there and you know that any answer he gives you will be a lie since he's already lied about it once.
"Next time he offers to pay, say hey let me get this one,I don't want to take advantage of our friendship. No mess, no fuss, just straight to the point."
Another piece of advice I don't see covered in the top comments:  get tested!  You may need to get tested again in a few months - ask your clinic.
"I think I'd wait until a time when you're both doing pretty good- not stressed, not hungry, not tired, not busy, etc., and sit her down. Tell her you want to talk to her about something and just want her to listen. It's not about blame, it's about making sure you guys know what's going on with each other and you want to share something that you've noticed is happening that has been bumming you out. Tell her you've noticed a pattern where you want to talk about your problems and she doesn't acknowledge them, or minimizes them. Tell her how that feels and what you would rather notice. If she interrupts to make excuses or correct you, just ask her to let you finish and then when you're done she can tell you exactly what she feels, too. Hopefully if you can really talk about how it makes you *feel*, she will understand what her behavior is doing to you and how it's driving a wedge between you, and she'll make a change. And maybe when she speaks, you'll be able to see where she's coming from, too, it might surprise you.

If that doesn't work, I'd suggest therapy so you can have someone guide you through this process."
"I thought that that was ludicrous as well. The guy can't even take the 3 minutes of his busy day to read a reddit post, and that's considering that OP almost broke up with him recently over this issue. OP, you're ranking pretty damn low on his priority list. 

I couldn't take this myself. My husband is the polar opposite of proactive, I've had to initiate all of those important conversations about relationship with him, but he always gave me answers right away - it's fine for your partner not to initiate these conversations, but not giving you any answers for this long is pure neglect. I think that you may be wasting your time at this point."
"After 8 years, this is all you want? 

&gt;Just the fucking gesture that he thinks about it, and wants it, to give me some sort of assurance that this is going somewhere.

After eight years, you know. He KNOWS. He either doesn't want to marry anyone, or he doesn't want to marry you. You want to settle for crumbs at this point. You're actually *encouraging* him to kick the can down the road, as long as you get your answers. The incredible thing here is that if he would just mutter something promising enough, you'd hang in for a few more years. You're loudly telling him how to keep you, this bare minimum thing, ""you don't have to give me a ring or propose or start planning a wedding...just SAY you want it someday,"" and he refuses. 

You are telling him how to keep you, and he refuses."
"Simple yet effective. I like it, thank you"
Yeah Paul knows what’s up and it seems like he’s helping you see what’s going on
"She remembers. She's just blaming the alcohol because you didn't reciprocate. 

If you're interested in a relationship, ask her on a date. 

If you're interested in some fun, it sounds like she'd be down for some no-strings action. 

If you want to keep the friendship the way it is, then do nothing and never bring it up again."
"So my shot-in-the-dark guess here is that your husband wants to be the “man of the house” &amp; that you managing various aspects of your lives together (like your finances) is deeply upsetting to him. So he’s compensating by exerting control in other areas, like expecting you to ask permission to go out, to get his approval on your outfits &amp; to be driven around by him. I think this is more alarming than you let on here, specifically the part about not “testing” him. Bad behavior in relationships never starts out cranked to max level. It starts with your partner really subtly testing you to see what you’ll endure, then escalating as you find the new normal."
"&gt; he later said he could find tons of women who would want to be married to and have babies by a doctor and that they’d be a better mother and wife anyways. 
#
&gt; I’ve been at my moms for a day now and he’s been calling

As much as your situation sucks, this made me laugh. He said that about ""tons of women"" purely to prey on your insecurities, and now he doesn't entirely know what's up since it's not working. 

""I can find plenty of other women!"" ""OK."" ""Why are you still divorcing me?? *pikachu face*""

(And I'd also say that don't give up things you are entitled to during the divorce. Like if the house is a marital asset and you are entitled to half of it, don't give that up for nothing. You spent 11 years on that arrogant navel-gazer, you helped him build his career, you *do* deserve a piece of the cake for that work.)"
"&gt;I told him that I'd heard firsthand from my boss that I did nothing wrong, and that the customer was out of line

This is literally all that matters. The company culture is what matters here, and your boss has made it clear you did nothing wrong. 

Also, he's severely underplaying how fucked up that was. For someone to say that directly to your face is literally sexual harassment, and he's acting like you're the one that's over the top. I'm pissed off *for* you in this situation."
"&gt;she guilt-tripped me saying she wouldn’t be able to finish school because she’d be so depressed

You are not responsible for her mental health. You need to start telling her that she needs to see a therapist if her mental health is that fragile."
"Excellent answer. I’m a physician myself and I’m furious on your behalf. It’s as if your needs and wants don’t matter to him at all and this is the first time you’re conscious of this. Something has got to change at this point because you can’t have a healthy marriage to someone you resent, and I think counseling is the way to go."
"Drop him. He doesn't want to commit to you but he wants to be possessive and prevent you from talking to other men and has no respect for your privacy or autonomy. If I were you I'd text him saying you know what he did, it's unacceptable, never contact you again and then block him."
"American through and through here. It is nasty as hell not to wash your hands after you go to the bathroom. It is also nasty not to ever use soap. Nothing about that is OCD. Taking off shoes is a preference, but I really don't understand being so committed to wearing shoes in the house that you'd refuse if someone else had a preference for taking them off. Can he not just get a pair of slippers for the house if he wants something on his feet?

Sounds like he grew up in a really unclean household if his sister is the same way. Who are these people you work with who think that WASHING YOUR HANDS makes you a germaphobe?"
"Here’s the thing to understand: this is known as quid pro quo harassment. You feel his good reference depends on your continued participation of this flirtation he’s created in his mind. Reporting it won’t ruin your career - in fact, if he goes on to give you a bad reference in retaliation for reporting this, you’ll have grounds for a lawsuit. 

Don’t be afraid to tell him he’s making you uncomfortable. He’s certainly not concerned about *your* comfort. Tell him once, very simply: “that makes me uncomfortable”. Don’t go into an elaborate explanation about why, or that he’s married, he’s your superior etc. Just that he’s made you uncomfortable. If he persists in this creepy ass behavior, go to HR. Be prepared with dates and places these things took place, and whether there were any witnesses. Have notes of direct quotes, as close as you can remember, of things he’s said. 

Don’t let this man make you fear for your career when he’s the one being inappropriate. You’ve done nothing wrong and didn’t encourage or invite his advances. He should know better. It’s not your problem that he apparently doesn’t. Don’t waste any time feeling sorry for what will happen to him: focus on the fact that what’s he’s doing is both morally wrong and illegal."
Buy plastic cutlery. Or wooden.
"Has he been to your doctor's appointments with you? It sounds like he may need to hear directly from a medical professional that his concern is over the top. If he has and still won't accept it, perhaps some couples counseling would be a good idea to communicate how his behavior is making you feel."
"&gt; I'm looking for advice on how to work this out and move on. 

The ball is really in your husband's court for that.

You're basically asking us how to not let it bother you that your husband did something irresponsible and then lied about it. It *should* bother you."
"You are dating a large raccoon. Do not feel foolish for failing to notice up to this point, they are very cunning."
Woah I'm a lady and had no idea! I pity the man that tries to trick women that know these things. Its almost like clothing companies got our backs lol
"These posts are among my favorites on this subreddit. So wholesome haha.

I would just say it straight. Maybe couch it in terms of looks (“they don’t look good on you”) instead of size (don’t say “those pants are too small for you”)"
"She sounds like she has been checked out of your relationship for a while OP. If anything, she did both of you a favor and you dodged a bullet. You deserve to be with someone who wants to be with you and this woman wasn't that person. You have the right idea in mind. That the time and space you need to heal from your break up."
"&gt; I hear so many married couples saying “I knew my wife was the one the day I met her”

Yeah, they're full of shit.

I love my wife. The thought of being without her now makes me feel like I'm standing on the edge of a cliff with the wind pushing hard at my back. If something happened to her I'd have to learn how to breathe all over again. She's in me so deep I'm not sure how my heart would even beat without her. She makes me so happy I don't have words for it.

I remember the first time I saw her. I remembered her name, but that was about it. She introduced herself to a roomful of people, we didn't talk until days later. We became friends not long after that.

Within months I *really liked* her, but it was much longer before it became love, really actually love, and much longer still before I was sure that I'd love her forever.

It's completely okay not to know that they're ""the one"". COMPLETELY.

The thing people feel at first sight is, at most, lust, or infatuation.

It can *lead to* love. Love can *start* there. But it can just as easily end up at incompatibility or toxicity.

A functional relationship doesn't just happen. You have to communicate, you have to learn to understand each other, know the things the other person needs to feel loved and cared for, know that they care just as much about *you* feeling loved and cared for. You need to learn how to resolve it when you disagree.

Love happens slowly. It grows on you. Like a fungus."
"You need to talk to a therapist about your feelings of betrayal. You should work through it before you lash out at your husband.

Take the time to figure out if you can get past this.

I'm thinking it's easy to determine which responses here are from young men."
"He doesn’t see you as an equal partner. He sees you as an accessory to him, as a planet in the orbit of him which is there to bask in his glory. He does not support you emotionally, he does not see you as a fully accomplished human being. 

You guys need counselling, and I don’t know if there is any hope even then."
"You don't **have** to be able to prove anything. This isn't court. 
It's suspicious enough on his own, you don't need to be Sherlock Holmes, here. 


Either pack his stuff up and leave it outside, change the lock on the door if needed, or just ask him point blank who she is, how long has he been cheating, and does he even have anything to say for himself? 

And get that phone back, you own it."
"You probably didn't do anything wrong, but she's growing up and becoming a young woman and the physical boundaries she was ok with at age 10 aren't good enough at age 15.  Don't take it personally, don't pester her for a ""reason"", don't make her discomfort all about you, and just interact with her normally but without the kissing."
He sure seems to know a lot about guys jacking off to women they know casually.....hmmm.   Totally his problem and frankly its a big red flag of controlling behavior.  Maybe he'll find a nice Amish girl
1-800-hisproblem. Your body not his. Tell him to grow up or ship out.
"Ugh! I had a BF who always insisted on bringing things up juuuust as I was laying down to go to sleep. I'd entertain him for a few minutes and then push it off, like, ""I'm sorry I have to get up early; I'm getting some sleep now. Can we talk about this later?"" 

I should add that he would stew and pout all day and never bring up anything, and not even answer me if I asked if he was okay. Until it was time for bed, and then it all came out. It's like he wanted me to be sleep-deprived? Maybe he just wanted to wreck my day the next day? Maybe he was so goddamn narcissistic that he just didn't fucking care about my work schedule. 

One night, he started some shit around midnight. It was a Friday night, so I engaged. He was all, ""What happened to you not liking to deal with shit late at night?"" ""Well, I don't work tomorrow, I can sleep in. Surely you understand the difference between weekend and work day?"" He acted like it had never occurred to him that I might want to get a good night's sleep before work and he thought I was just being a controlling asshole with arbitrary ""rules"" about when he could bring things up. How 'bout when I'm not tired and halfway asleep already, can we try that?"
Your dad sucks. I’d really love to know his justification for this because it’s absolute bullshit. Honestly I don’t know if I’d get over this a long time.... I can’t even wrap my head around this situation. Seriously what was he thinking?!
Good for you. He's toxic.
"I’m going to tell you my own experience in my marriage, not sure if any is relevant to your experience. My husband has also put on a lot of weight, and tends to kind of yo-yo with his weight, which corresponds with a lot of other behaviors. When he is at a lower weight, it’s not his physical appearance that makes me more attracted to him. It’s the fact that when he’s at a lower weight, he’s taking better care of himself, he’s more active, he’s happier because he’s engaging in sports/hobbies that he enjoys, he’s fueling his body with nutritious food and water which gives him energy to be more present and engaged in *every* part of our life, and THAT is attractive to me. When he is gaining lots of weight, he is sluggish, spends lots of time on his phone, and just generally doesn’t seem to have much energy to devote to our family/home life, and that makes me annoyed and frustrated and NOT attracted to him. 

As you know from losing the weight, it takes getting proper sleep, water intake, nutrition, and being active, and ALL those things have other effects on a marriage other than physical weight.

Those are just my thoughts and I don’t know your background, but those are some things that have been an issue in my marriage."
"Your dad *took out loans* to pay for your cousins' tuitions, and didn't tell your mother.

He betrayed his family in order to appease his sister.  

You and your brother and your mother are actually the people who paid for those tuitions.  And your aunt's mortgage, too.  All the cash your father bestowed on them was at the expense of his family.  Your father gave away your mother's hard-earned money to people who look down on her.  He put them *both* in debt.  Your mother's labor will continue to be used to pay off the debt he incurred.

WTF is wrong with your father?  Jesus, I don't know this guy, I don't know you, I don't have a dog in this fight, but I want to scream at him that he's a dipped-in-dogshit asshole.

And now he's whining that it's *unfair* you and your brother aren't thrilled to learn he was stingy with his family so he could be overly generous with his sister's family?

Your anger is justified.  Normal.  Your mother has the right to divorce him over this level of deceit and financial abuse.  He put the security and wellbeing of his own wife and children beneath his desire to be Lord Bountiful to his sister's family *that thinks they are better than you, your brother, and your mother.*

Go no contact for as long as it takes to recover.  

Check your credit history to make sure he hasn't taken out loans in your name.

Tell your mother to check her credit, too.  And contact a lawyer.  If your father forged her name on loan documents, she may have some recourse."
"I read through your 1,700-word-long post and rewrote it into something much more digestible. This is my interpretation of what you're saying:

&gt; I'm currently emotionally invested in a man who lives seven hours away from me. Although we have been talking for the last four months, we are not currently in a relationship.

&gt; He got used to me sending nudes to him, which I admittedly started doing too soon. When I didn't send them frequently enough for his liking, he would pressure me to send more.

&gt; I feel like I've been upfront about my feelings (which are strong), but I never explicitly asked him if he wanted to date me. He has indicated that he doesn't like being in relationships, which is good evidence that he would not want a long-distance relationship with me.

&gt; He has been very cagey about making plans to meet up in person even when I've offered to travel to him. I tried to play it cool even though his continued unwillingness to meet should have indicated that he wasn't interested in anything beyond receiving nudes and attention.

&gt; I recently moved to another city where I reconnected with and old man I used to have sex with a decade ago. Inexplicably, I decided to have sex with him again. Perhaps even more inexplicably, I decided to tell my long-distance not-boyfriend despite owing him no details about my personal life.

&gt; He expressed disappointment in me becuase despite not being willing to date or even meet up with me, he did want me to be locked down to him. He then tried to suggest that he had been falling in love with me and my current behavior was deterring him, even though he had made multiple excuses as to why he didn't even want to see me in person.

&gt; Despite us talking to each other every day for the last four months, the topic of exclusivity never came up, which contradicts me saying that I had been ""upfront"" about my feelings earlier in the year.

&gt; Even though he has no right to be upset and I shouldn't be talking to him, I - a 29-year-old adult - am still concerned about pleasing this man who has basically been leading me on since winter. Should I try to fix this?

Take a hint from literally everyone commenting in this thread and cut this guy loose. He's wants the attention and sexual gratification of an LDR with none of the commitment and you've been giving it to him. Now that you did literally anything else with another man he's trying to manipulate you into thinking that it's your fault, and the crazy thing is that you're buying it."
"You can't have his brother in the house, especially with the baby. I'm sorry and I know it's a really hard hill to die on but it has to be. You need to make it really clear to your fiancé that while you love him and his family, his brother is violent and unsafe. He needs to be reevaluated by a doctor."
"""I just want him to tell me the truth"" why? You know the truth. But you want him to respect you enough to admit that he cheated. But if he didn't respect you enough to not cheat on you, why would he respect you enough to be honest about it?"
"I think what would keep me from moving on if I was in your position is that I would be unable to trust that he would not do this again. Some things I would do right away:

* make sure I had full access to ALL shared accounts
* go over all the records for everything and continue to do this on a very frequent basis so that I knew about every single purchase when it was made
* set up an account that he could not access and put emergency savings in it in case he managed to tank everything else 

But like, you're already in therapy because he's a liar. Is he going to stop being a liar? Because it seems like this is what he is."
"You are only five months in--if he can't get his problem under control, you should walk. It only gets worse from here."
"So many red flags here.

First, no one's roommate sells meth to the point that he's caught and evicted by management without the other roommate noticing. He absolutely was aware of the meth selling.

...so you're dating a guy who's 30 years old, allowed his 4yo child to live in an apartment used for drug trafficking, and now relies on a 24yo for support.

....and he's not being grateful or mature about it. Instead of taking responsibility he's blaming you for not staying home/doing more with his kid.

This reeks of a bad ending for you. You are being taken advantage of and this guy is lying to you. Kick him out before he ruins you financially. There are family shelters in all major cities and municipalities, it might not be the ideal but he and his child will have a place to go."
Text her to tell him to come get his stuff.
"Do **not** tell them anything until you are living independently without their financial support. I understand wanting to be honest, and in most cases that's laudable, but in your case you have good reasons to keep things secret for a while. 

You cannot predict how people like this will react."
"It depends if you actually want to talk to him about it, or if you just want him out of your life. You need to decide that before you can decide how to raise it. 

It might not just be as simple as packing his stuff (even though that would be tempting). Is his name on the lease? Do you have any other joint responsibilities?"
I know. I've never been so angry reading a post on here. The fucking audacity of that man.
"It's because he wants her to break up with him. For real. It's because he is lazy and doesn't want to do the hard work of breaking up and moving out and all that stuff, and bonus--if he just treats her like garbage that he forgot to put into the can, she'll just handle all of it herself (like she always has) AND he'll get to be the good guy because he got broken up with! Win / win, for him!"
I will do this today. Thank you.
"GOOD.

Now hire an awesome divorce attorney. Don't give up money or property to ""be nice"" because he's not going to do the same and he won't think you're nice no matter what you do anyway. I'm glad you've got your mom to help you; aside from her, get in touch with as much of Team You as you can and don't be afraid to ask them for support. Be as kind to yourself as you possibly can.

You are going to have doubts and moments of regret. Some parts of this are going to be hard and you might miss some things. That doesn't mean your choice was wrong; it just means life is complicated. Your life is going to be better in the long run because you stood up for yourself and refused to stay married to someone who doesn't respect or like you.

You did a good thing. You've got this."
"You know he's lying. Sometimes I hear these stories on Reddit, and I can understand how maybe a miscommunication or misunderstanding happened. This is not one of those times."
"Sometimes doing the right thing, st the right moment, may be the hardest thing you've ever done. This applies to your relationship. This is honestly above our pay grade of random gossipy redditors who volunteer our advice. Your husband had to seek therapy to process his childhood trauma, and you should offer to go to couple's therapy with him to help learn how to communicate his horrific past. That and whatever confronts him, that's the only advice I feel prepared to give."
"Oh my god. I didn’t even think of this, thank you for this!"
"I know that this post is about being angry with your dad and I’m totally with you, but people like your aunt (I unfortunately have encountered many people like that) make me insane. The fact that she feels entitled to her brothers money and thinks that her children deserve it more than his children is crazy. The kicker about this whole thing for me was that she reached out to you to scold you about needed financial assistance from your dad??? My blood is boiling for you, so sorry OP."
"While generally I’d agree that having your own separate things as a couple is important, the situation does rub me wrong and here’s why.

You only asked to play one time. You didn’t ask to rejoin completely, or take over his friends– you asked for one game with them. The fact that he was willing to let you play with “his friends” alone and opted to instead sit and read while you did is very strange. If he was so concerned about you taking his friends, I highly doubt he would suggest leaving you alone with them. It sounds more like he doesn’t want you two together in the same place with them than anything else.

It’s fine to have separate friends. It’s healthy to want that. But this doesn’t appear to be that case."
"Are you in therapy on your own, too? Keep going to marriage counseling, but please make an appointment with a separate therapist for your own sessions. Money problems are the #1 cause of divorce, and this is a serious problem you are facing. You need to keep working with your husband on this if staying together is your priority, but you need and deserve your own space to work through your feelings as an individual."
"&gt;At what point are his problems not my responsibility?

Pretty much always. It is possible to look out for yourself without being selfish and you have certainly reached that point. Asking him to leave or even evicting him at this point isn't easy, but it certainly isn't evil or selfish either."
It is ok to disengage from something or someone who is hindering your recovery.  I understand you may have some guilt about stepping away but please remember that you can't save someone who isn't working toward saving themselves.  They will just drown you with them. Please take care and be safe.
"He did a dangerous U turn with your children in the car. Your 5 year old thought you were literally going to die. They were crying when your husband was driving dangerously, they easily may have been afraid for their lives.

My dad would also drive dangerously when he was angry and wanted to show someone, and I remember every single one of those moments. He also had a scary temper, and he also would get angry when my mom even tried to speak to him, because she was his scapegoat for all of his problems in life. I have no respect for him and stay low contact, and before my mom divorced him I told her that if she stayed I was going to cut contact with her too to the extent that seeing her would also mean seeing my father. 

I personally think you should leave. Post on r/legaladvice about gaining majority custody. You can get alimony. I can’t say for sure, but if he’s anything like my dad he’ll still treat your children well because he still wants to be perceived as the better parent and treat you as the scapegoat even from afar. Talk to a therapist first though as well. 

As a note, you titled this post with your husband not having ‘energy to talk to you’ then go on to say that he literally risked the lives of your children in an angry tantrum. Please don’t rugsweep the dangerousness of his worst actions, for the sake of your kids."
I really like Paul. We need more Pauls.
"This isn't sustainable. You have been supporting his dream for a long time, you need to be able to take a turn enjoying yourself. I'm a performer so I understand how soul-crushing it is to have to work in a field that isn't my passion, but I do it because I have to support myself somehow. It isn't fair of him to expect that you are always making the sacrifices in order for him to do what he loves. He needs to make some sacrifices of his own.

It's...kind of insane that you are looking for a second job when you're already the breadwinner so that he literally doesn't have to do anything he doesn't want to do. He needs to be the one seeking supplemental income."
"I had to reread the ages. If after 18 months of dating a 29 YEAR OLD can’t be bothered to break up over phone or in person, said person is not worth another fleeting thought. Don’t respond and block her."
"Usually, the prescribed remedy to cheating is for the unfaithful partner to be transparent and respectful of agreed upon boundaries.

Your partner is clearly not interested in remedying his infidelity. 

So does it matter if he actually cheated again? He is clearly disrespecting your relationship."
"You need to **wake up**. You didn't ""lose"" your family; you have two kids who NEED you to step up and be the best father you can be, not a sad sack borderline alcoholic playing the ""what if"" game. You're their dad. There is no replacing you. 

Want to change your custody agreement? Call a lawyer. Ex's new partner is violating your custody agreement? Call a lawyer. Do you actually want things to change, or do you want to just mope? Because your kids are only young for a short period of time. There are only so many first days of school, soccer games, school plays. If you miss those now because you were moping and feeling sorry for yourself, you will never get a do-ever, and neither will your kids.

You can't go back in time un-divorce your ex. What's done is done. But what you CAN do is throw all your energy into showing the fuck up for your kids as much as you possibly can. You can be a man they can look up to and respect."
"When he sobers up - ask him if he had made out with any of the female students because there's no reason for him to go your home same night  of the part  to say ""I don't want to be rush... But It's really hard for me to not cheat on you with all these temptations"" and then leave due to guilt. That sounds like an admission that he knowingly fucked up with you and whomever at college...."
"Oh. My. Lawd. 

If a guy said that to me? My response would be, “Well let me make it easy for you. You can’t cheat on me, because we’re no longer dating.”"
"You need to go straight to your management, and you need to tell them in no uncertain terms that you made a bad call, you sincerely apologize, and that your employer needs to make the best decision for the company. And that them making that decision will leave ZERO bad feelings between you and the company. Tell them that you're horrified that you feel like your recommendation has not lived up to your usual standards, and let his manager and senior management at the company do what they need to do.

You then need to go to Sam and say that you cannot protect him from consequences from his actions, and ask him if he is aware of how poor his performance has been. Let him know that you have done your due diligence and got his foot in the door, but any decisions about his employment from now on are purely a factor of how he performs at the company. You cannot be involved in his employment any further, and all future matters are between him and his manager. Tell him that you feel for him, but you are not his manager and you have no pull with his management besides being able to recommend him for this job.

AND THEN YOU STEP AWAY. Tell your partner, so that you can prepare yourselves. This has nothing to do with him being depressed, or trans, or anything else. This sounds like he's selfish. He lied to you to GO TO AN ANIME CONVENTION!!!"
I think it’s perfectly normal to not have jobs lined up after every move you have made to places where HE already had jobs or job offers. It doesn’t sound like he is very understanding and I’d be worried about future implications of this behavior. Are there other areas in your relationship where he treats you like this?
"Oh honey, they are not getting a divorce mainly or solely because of your neck. They are getting a divorce because of a lot of underlying issues your parents have done a good job of hiding from you. 
It's probably been a pot waiting to boil over for a long time. If it hadn't been your neck injury, it would have been something else that pushed it over."
"What you should really be asking is, can I control myself and my emotions? It sounds like your attracted to her now, even if you have made terms that nothing is going to happen. However, even if we told ourselves nothing will happen, it doesn’t stop us from wanting or feeling a certain way.

If you can control that, then go for it. If not, avoid the awkwardness and confusion."
"Like... hundreds of absolute strangers read it, and her own boyfriend of 8 years cba. She’s asking for so little from him, it’s honestly depressing."
"&gt; What am I doing wrong? 

Staying married to this guy.

The reason you don't have a job is because you've had to relocate twice recently, both times to places with limited job opportunities."
"One thing I have done with my husband when he’s made baseless assumptions is to start asking him where he got his information. Did he read a book or an article?  Are these just assumptions he’s making? 

And when he inevitably has to agree he hasn’t gotten this info from anywhere you assert that YOU HAVE done the research and talked to a doctor. So why does he think he knows better than that? 

And if he gets hyperbolic about being a monster. Just calmly say “Stop, that’s an exaggeration. I’m simply saying you don’t get a say until you’re actually informed.” 

You become a brick wall for this type of thing. Eventually he’s going to understand he can either shut up or get informed."
"&gt; The fact that he gave you her number to text probably means he already collaborated with her and told her to tell you the same lie. 

This was my take as well.


That or someone (hooker?) leaving them behind to give a heads up to OP about the state of her marriage."
"She's your friend... just tell her you don't know what this is but wanted to let her know. 

You wouldn't be my friend anymore if you didn't tell me."
"Your sister is growing up and learning how to be an adult. It's a long process, and there's a lot of trying out new things.

One thing young people try out as they grow up is *setting personal boundaries*. As a kid, a lot of what happens to you happens because other people want it to happen, and you don't get asked for permission much. As an adult, you get to set a boundary of ""ask me before you try to hug me"", for example, and you can expect other adults to respect that boundary. That's a normal behavior, and it has nothing to do with **you** specifically; she's just learning how to be an adult, to set and defend boundaries, and function in the adult world. It's healthy and natural, and it's not about you. 

Another thing that happens when people grow up is that their preferences change. You don't like the same foods you liked when you were 12, your sister doesn't listen to the same songs she listened to when she was 5, and now, at 15, maybe she feels differently about public displays of affection from her family than she used to. That's normal, and natural, and has nothing to do with you specifically. 

Your sister has said ""I don't like it when you do X"". So don't do X."
It’s funny how he harps on not being physically abusive. That’s not the only type of abuse. Mental and emotional abuse are just as bad. He doesn’t get an award for not beating you. If you don’t like him doing something repeatedly that hurts or offends you he should stop.
"It's pretty clear that he has been cheating, to be honest. 

If you need an opening remark for that conversation, just tell him you've seen his phone bill. Then leave a pointed silence for him to respond. I suspect the conversation will develop from there. 

Be clear in your mind how you want the logistics to work. Depending on how much stuff he has, perhaps he packs tonight, gives you his keys and stays elsewhere tonight, then collects his gear tomorrow. And that's it - done."
"Hi OP! Other commenters have touched on the worst of the situation here. I just want to make sure you know that everything you’re feeling is so, so, so valid. It really sounds like your husband will not compromise. Do *not* quit your career for him right now. Your husband has, so far, gotten everything to go his way because you’ve allowed it to. 

Tell him everything you said here. How your “unimportant” career carried him through everything he ever wanted in his adult life, and that career wasn’t just a placeholder for you. You have made sacrifice after sacrifice and left everyone you care about behind, just for him. You emotionally, physically, and financially supported him because you love him. Tell him what you’re thinking - that marriage isn’t tit for tat, you didn’t make those sacrifices only to cash in on them later... but that you have compromised on every major thing you have wanted in this marriage, and goddamnit, he needs to be open to compromise, too. 

Now is your time to be selfish. You *get* to be selfish. Your life’s work is significant. If he wants a kid so badly right now, he can research some good childcare options, because that’s your line in the sand.

Draw the line. Put yourself first. Because it sounds like you haven’t in a long time.

If he isn’t interested in compromise, then do think hard about what the future holds. Allow yourself the chance to feel your feelings. You only get one opportunity to live your life, don’t throw all your desires away on someone else’s behalf."
Not a good sign. Has he ever been unfaithful in the past?
"I think I was most worried about the blowback from our mutual friends, because I didn't want to be the one who kicked Frank out onto the street. But then I started thinking about it...and I'm like....why can't THEY help him? They can't judge me if they aren't doing anything to help him either. And if they do, they're jerks"
This is secret technology we must protect
"I would look at the camera, squint my eyes and mouth ""WTH?"" Very clearly. Then nod your head as you check your watch and write a detailed note on a piece of paper. This will freak him out because he will know you caught on and are documenting it. If he still keeps doing it go to his supervisor, since it sounds like he might be yours."
Thanks I will get checked.
"I know you said you've communicated in a lot of ways, but you also said you haven't wanted to pressure him. He knows you want sex. You've made it clear. That isn't the type of communication needed.

Communicating at this point means straight up saying ""I want to have sex and you clearly don't. We need to have an actual conversation about this because I am unhappy and I want to see if this is something we can work on. If you don't want to talk about this with me, then we need to see a counsellor. If you don't want to figure this out then understand that this is not sustainable for me much longer"". 

You guys are married. You have a child. You are in your 30's and 40's. Time to get your communication about sex up to speed."
"Dude you need to leave her ASAP, if you don’t feel like having sex don’t. The way she insists is just wrong and the whole “internship” idea is crazy to me. I’m sorry about your brother and losing your job too."
"Not at all! Many people, even Americans, take their shoes off inside. And washing hands after using the washroom is just sanitary."
"&gt;  he gave me his ex girlfriends number

No, he gave you a number he says is his ex girlfriend's.

Of course he didn't find a 6 year old thong of his ex in a brand new dresser and then put them in his jacket to throw away but then forgot before throwing it out and then put the jacket in the laundry. You'd have to want to believe the lie to not immediately know how full of shit he is.

Having him tell you the truth after cheating on you and lying about it won't make you feel any better. Figure out what you want going forward, and then take steps to get there. Getting the truth out of him after you already caught him in the lie won't get you there."
"Just file for divorce.


Is it going to be a financial burden? Yes.


Is it going to be suck for a bit? Yes. 


Will it be better than spending the rest of your life as a servant to this man, his family, and his needs above yours? ABSOLUTELY.


You will eventually grow and be able to tale care of yourself, and or you'll meet someone that doesnt treat you like property."
He is 100% still with his child's mother and cheating on her with you. One. Hundred. Percent.
"Depression was the vibe I was picking up on as well! I know you've talked to him about mental health, but he may not see himself as depressed. He may mean it when he says he's fine, just tired/not in the mood...that's how depression can present itself (and even more so in men)

He may be more open to the idea of depression/mental health/hormone imbalance if it came from a doctor/therapist, instead of you. Thars just how it is sometimes.

In the meantime I hope you know you're amazing and desirable and this has nothing to do with you!! *hugs*!!"
"Do you even think she'd take the job if you have an offer? I know I wouldn't, that sounds stressful as all hell"
"Sorry bf, he might have to adjust his hanging with your work crew to avoid awkwardness but he DOES NOT GET A SAY in who you and your team hire at work. Period. Not to mention he doesn't get to disadvantage you, who he cheated on, or screw up her job prospects, after already messing with her life once. Super controlling and selfish on all counts. If he's still processing his guilt and shame, maybe a counselor would help."
"I know exactly how she feels and had serious issues with my husband when we were dating.  I can tell you exactly why it's so upsetting.

It adds an insane amount of pressure.  Forcing her to always be the one to chose what to do and where to eat, puts ALL the responsibility and pressure on to her, of picking something everyone will like, and makes her responsible for that choice if someone isn't happy.

It means SHE has to always do the thinking and planning, figuring out what is open, what everyone wants, how long it takes to get there, etc.

It comes across that you just DON'T CARE enough to give a single thought to where to go.

It's absolutely INFURIATING and so stressful.

I had to learn that my husband doesn't have a lot of strong opinions and is ok with most of my choices, but HE had to learn that it is entirely unfair to put that much pressure onto ONE person in the relationship.

So my friend, start taking the pressure off her and make a damn decision.  It's worth it...trust me."
He hasn't due to work but I think you're right that maybe he needs to hear it directly if he doesnt trust my decision-making.
"I do want to talk to him about it, but if it has been an on going affair for months then I would want him out my life which it seems to me it has been. 

I live with my parents and he lives with me, he has no connections to the house other then living here and paying board"
Wait I’m stuck on the edit ... you said you were so distressed that you had to tell strangers how you were feeling to gain perspective and he’s not interested enough in what you have to say to read it right away ????? No. Just no. This is not someone who is emotionally invested in you.
Yes. And there are a few other suspicious things that happened. 😬
"""I can't control what other people do and it is unfair for you to take out your insecurities on me. If our relationship is going to survive, I need YOU to to learn how to manage your insecurities and trust me.""

Fify."
"You can't really bar them from moving but you can say ""Mom, Dad, since you guys are considering moving out here I just want to clarify that (husband) and I are pretty busy these days and won't be available to hang out very often."""
"This sounds exactly like my (also doctor) ex husband.  “Look at the big house you live in, you will shut up and appreciate me”. Never mind the fact he was either at work or drinking his fifth of vodka a day. He never, ever participated in my or our kids lives. I mean literally never. Never changed a diaper, played with the kids, made a meal, cleaned a thing, made an appointment for himself, nothing. But I was a terrible wife for being unhappy, just because we had money."
"I feel the same that it would be doubly unfair to her.

She was already upset about being unwittingly involved in cheating, I think it would be so unfair to her if she lost out on a job too"
"&gt; always having no opinion just makes you seem like an entirely passive wet blanket. 


Yes! Thank you to your wife for articulating this, because I find this type of passivity really unattractive as well. IMO, it’s one of those stops on the way to feeling like you are your partner’s mom instead of their SO."
"&gt;you also get a say in your life together

best point i've seen on this thread."
"It took me a while to realize this, but it's exactly right."
"Your spouse shouldn't be calling you a whore (in any language), fighting with you frequently, frequently getting upset enough while fighting you to *intentionally lock you out of the two-way conversation to rant at you in a way you cannot interact with*, and continually disrespecting you by still doing the above when you tell him to stop and that you feel disrespected.

Your spouse doesn't respect you. You could be a polyglot and that wouldn't solve the fact that your spouse doesn't respect you.

See a divorce lawyer."
"&gt; I think we could totally manage to be together for 6 months in a long distance relationship but she refuses.

Let me correct that: you think *you* could totally manage 6 months of LDR, but she *knows*, from experience, she cannot. 

I’m not telling you to stay home. Quite the opposite. You should go. But this is the end of your relationship. She made it clear that she has tried it once, hated it, and is uninterested in repeating the experience. That’s fair - she doesn’t owe you any more than that. No one is a bad guy here. Some people just cannot do long distance. And you’re at a point in your life where you SHOULD be chasing new experiences and opportunities. It sucks, but it happens. 

Let her go, and enjoy your time abroad."
"I'm a 50M who has worked in tech and software my whole life.  Your reaction was dead solid perfect and is exactly how I would expect anyone that works for me to respond.  The language was borderline but completely understandable.  The comment about you being nicer to look at then Bob was inappropriate by itself.  Mentioning your ass should get that guy fired.

Your boyfriend is a bit of an idiot.  Not only did your boss give you the correct ethical response to how you handled the situation, it's the correct legal one.  If he did nothing, tried to tell you to just deal with it, or demanded that you apologize for anything other than maybe the swear word, he's opening himself up for a sexual harassment claim."
"&gt;  lazy in a relationship

yes! and read her edit  -   he can't even be arsed to read this post"
"I would also make sure your daughter knows that she deserves to feel happy and accomplished. And to stop this talk about being lucky her book ""slipped through."" That's bullshit. Your daughter has accomplished something wonderful that she WORKED for, she has earned. Just because lots of people work hard and don't get published, does not mean that your daughter should not feel very proud of her accomplishment that she is being published.

Stop thinking of this as a ""sister"" thing and see it as a grown ass woman being shitty to a young woman who has done an really awesome thing."
"Would your husband be willing to move elsewhere in the country? It sounds like you'd do better someplace like the Pacific Northwest, where the climate is more temperate, people are liberal and environmentally-conscious, and you can engage in your preferred hobbies and make friends. That seems like the best-case scenario to me."
"I understand why, on an emotional level, you feel conflicted and guilty about not wanting them to move in. I get it, and I sympathize, I really do. But rationally and logically, it’s clear what you have to do and there’s nothing to feel conflicted or badly about. 

Your first priority has to be the safety of *your* child, and not only is it clear that your daughter is not safe around your fiancé’s brother, but it’s clear that he poses a very real and very dangerous threat to her well-being and possibly her life (as well as your well-being, and that of anyone who comes in contact with him). What your MIL is going through is very sad, and I understand that you want to help, but none of this is your responsibility, and to invite the brother into your house is just courting disaster and tragedy. 

Without immediate, professional intervention, the brother’s behavior is going to continue to get worse as he gets older, bigger, stronger and more independent. He *needs* inpatient treatment. None of you are even close to being equipped to help him. I like the suggestion made by others that you and your fiancé take the lead in researching options such as residential or inpatient treatment facilities. If you guys don’t do it now, it’s almost certain that within the next five or so years, the criminal justice system will intervene and the department of corrections in your state will give him a place to live. 

If your MIL resists or refuses to send him somewhere, then there’s nothing much you can do, and you’ll have to (*have to*) detach yourself from this situation. But under no circumstances should you allow your fiancé’s brother to move into your home, or even come into your home from this point forward. To do so would be putting all of you at risk in more ways than I think you realize."
"Holy shit. Do **not** get married and start a family ""asap"".  You are fucking 16 years old. What the hell???"
"There's not much you can do about the core problem, which is that your mother is depressed, lonely, and looking to amuse you as her substitute for a purpose in life. But you can make it easier to manage. Here's an idea - set up a dedicated Facebook or Insta for the funny things she wants to show you. Tell her you can't keep interrupting your day to look at things as she sends them, but she can send them as she sees them and you'll sit down with her for half an hour each evening (or whatever you can manage) and watch them with her. You could even bring in some microwave popcorn and pull them up on the TV in her room, if you have the technology for it, and make a bit of a thing of it."
"Your husband is testing the waters OP.

*  He's demanding you ask him for permission to do anything. If you don't he then ""jokes"" he won't let you leave. *That's not a joke. That's a threat.* 
* Routinely tells you he's bigger and stronger than you. *That's also not a joke. That's intimidation.* 
* You wear something and he calls it skanky. *That's demeaning*.  
* He has PHYSICALLY PUSHED YOU out of the driver's seat because he has decided you shouldn't drive at all anymore. *That's taking away a basic function from you.* 

OP He's escalating his behavior and trying to normalize it as ""jokes"" and you're trying to do the same thing. You're thinking that he's never hit you in anger and this is changing over time, rather than the rapid changes that happen in other abusive situations, that this is playful or he doesn't know better.

He's a grown adult. He knows better. Your husband is shitty and you need to get out there. Don't go to counselling with an abuser because they learn how to turn things on their victims. But you should seek out individual counselling for yourself to help you process this. Take this behavior seriously OP. There are red flags abound. You have control of fiances for now but what happens when he decides you need to ask for permission to handle them? Or he decides he's going to handle them and you're not allowed since he's already decided you shouldn't drive anymore. His ""jokes"" won't be just hypotheticals one day."
He's never going to do it. Counseling will not do anything for this.  Stop waiting on him and break up.  Your next to last paragraph summed it all up.  For 8 years you have had to initiate everything in your lives.  This is not a person you want to marry even if he ever gets to that point
Totallyyyy..: he’s trying to give you hints without straight out telling on his friend!
"I strongly recommend that you see a separate counselor for marriage counseling, and that he sees a separate (third) person for individual therapy. I am a little surprised your therapist has agreed to see both of you in this context."
"Does your psychiatrist know about your history of drug and alcohol abuse?

Her fears are actually not irrational - you do have a history of abusing drugs, people don't use antidepressants recreationally the way they use ketamine, and people do have adverse reactions to experimental treatments. She signed up to be in a relationship with someone with a mental illness but is setting a personal boundary at drug use - that's a reasonable boundary to have, even if the drugs are taken in a medical setting. Even if her fears were completely irrational, they're still real fears to her, and it's not a great idea to dismiss a partner's concerns because you feel they're not up to your standards of rationality. She literally showed up with research, so it's a bit disingenuous to call it ""irrational"" when really you mean ""I don't like the objections she has."" 

You should ask your psychiatrist if you can bring your girlfriend in for a session to talk about the pros and cons of the treatment. Your psychiatrist will be able to put her concerns in context and go over the potential risks and rewards with you.

Ultimately, though, you need to make the decision that is right for you, having carefully weight the pros and cons. And this:

&gt; I don't want her to leave because she is my only support system.

Is something you need to talk to your psychologist about. It's not healthy or sustainable to put all of that on one person."

"Some people, when they have something negative in their lives, build a marker, so to speak, on the side of the road they walk, so that they can look back later on and see how far they have come.

Other people instead build a shine to the negativity, and return to it to worship day after day; these people (like religious zealots of any path you could care to name) try to convert people to worship at the shrine of their own misery, because having other people there beside them makes them feel validated.

Your friend doesn't *want* solutions.  She wants you to stand there in her misery with her so that she will feel validated in feeling it.

Don't even tell her to break up; she already knows that is the thing that would resolve her misery...she doesn't *want* to resolve her misery, she wants to kneel before it day in, day out.  It has become what defines her, and she will not let it go unless and until she finds something else by which to measure her value.

Just tell her that you are done hearing about it, and that if she will not stop talking to you about it, you'll be done.

Then *stick* to that."
"No offense, but your girlfriend is nuts. You are entitled to have boundaries, if you don't like blowjobs, she's not entitled to rape you with her mouth

&gt;She has made a schedule, each week we need to have sex at least 3 times a  week WITH me getting blowjobs. If we do not, she will leave me

Tell her ""don't let the door hit ya, where the good Lord split ya!"" and be glad you're rid of her rapey ways"
"I second this OP - reading this almost made me want to cry, because I don't understand why you think you deserve this horrific behaviour. Abusive relationships are difficult, I know, but at the end of the day you deserve better. Your children deserve better. It's hard to leave an abusive relationship, but really - he could be a saint (which he's very evidently not) and it still wouldn't make up for any of his behaviour, but especially that horrific incident in the car."
Dude. Theres no way in hell a normal sane person would every treat complete strangers and real humans the way that she does for absolutely no reason especially picking on a kid and spitting on someone? Like who the heck do you think you are to spit on anyone on this planet? She sounds horrible just ugly ugly ugly inside I cant believe she exists I know I'm being super harsh but just imagine when she stops putting on her facade in front of you and she starts treating you badly. Do you really want to marry a person like this? Imagine having kids and her bullying your kids? Idk this seems so crazy idk why you still like her like for some perspective the worst thing that I do and what me and my boyfriend fight about is that I get lazy sometimes and I dont wake up early on the weekends and just want to sleep in lol.😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨

"So....he was dating other people while you guys were exclusive?  He denied it, and you just let it go?  And now he's making up convoluted lies about searching for her on social media?

"It seems like you're making a mountain out of a molehill.

Your dad and your fiance aren't hostile, they are civil in public and know how to behave.

I doubt he's going to trash your fiance at your wedding if he gives a speech.

If he doesn't want to give a speech, don't worry about it. Nobody gives a shit about speeches honestly at weddings. Everyone oohs and aaahs but I bet a week later they probably couldn't tell you what was said."
"Or you could just let go of the need to explain, not open that can of body-image-issue-inducing worms, and tell her that she's amazing and that you love her and support her no matter what."
"His response was psychotic. And he still doesn't think he's in the wrong, so how can you ever trust that something won't set him off like this again?

He needs to be alone and work on his trust issues. If he can't realize on his own that his reaction was not even in the stratosphere of normal, he still has far too much internal work to do to be a good partner right now."
"Whatever excuses he gives, don't fall for it. Paul sounds like he was giving you a heads up."
"Absolutely do not room with her.

If you want to stay friends, you need some rock solid boundaries. Like, she can only spend 5 minutes talking about whatever her shitty dad did lately, and then she has to change the topic. Or (this worked for me) she can only tell you about her troubles if she includes what she's going to do to fix her situation. Or she can't talk to you at all about this stuff because it's too triggery, if that's what you need!

Don't feel guilty. You setting boundaries is for the best. She has to learn to interact with other people outside an abusive context, and all her social skills were learned in an abusive environment, so of course she uses manipulation and pity-me requests to meet her needs. If she's going to ever grow, she needs to understand that healthy people do not use or put up with that bullshit. The kindest thing you can do for yourself and her is to put your foot down."
I don't think your father has dementia. I have a 15 year old daughter and I would be weirded out if a 40 year old uncle was inviting her to sit on his lap and hugging her extensively. Heck even she would feel uncomfortable with that kind of behavior.
"This is how 2 months feels, roll with the giddiness and feelings but take your time with the decisionmaking line moving in together."
"As a 23 year old chick just now looking to move out with someone, this sounds like my worst nightmare. I've had to deal with male roommates who were obviously attracted to me and its AWKWARD no matter how hard they tried to hide it. 


Even if she ends up being into you, this is the worst possible set up. Do NOT date roommates. If things end badly, it's so so so much worse. I literally just had a friend go through this and it was awful. Seems like finding your own places, but hanging out together and helping each other move is the best bet. 

Tell her you have heard some horror stories about moving in with a friend destroying the friendship (for real just look at a few posts on r/relationships lol) and you'd rather keep her as a close friend and find someone else to room with so it won't risk the friendship, or that you already found a space/someone else to room with. Just... something."
"&gt;I’m not saying you have to abandon ship now

"My advice? Get some self-respect and don't give this guy another thought. 

He lives with another woman (not sexual though...riiiigggght), goes for weeks without even SPEAKING to you, you're depressed when he's gone (living his life) and you consider this ""bliss?"" You're being used. Surely you see that? He knows you'll answer when you call, come running to him when he snaps his fingers, and won't bug him at home (out of ""respect for the family atmosphere"" he's supposedly trying to maintain.) And this is all heightened because, in the throes of passion, he threw out the word love. 

Actions speak louder than words. He doesn't treat you like he loves you because he doesn't. You say no one measures up to him, but based on what you've written, that's not a very high bar. 

I read this and I am just sad for you. You're a groupie turned booty call. It's pathetic and you deserve better. 

You say you don't stand a chance, but I think if you get out of your head for a minute you'll see that this guy is keeping you from true happiness. You need to let go of whatever fantasy you've created in your mind that says you can be happy with him or have any kind of meaningful relationship with him, cut off communication with him, and move on with your life. 

Good luck."
"It seems like he blew up way out of proportion, a huge over reaction. I can understand him being hurt because you ruined the surprise of the parasailing, maybe should have kept that to yourself, but definitely not worthy of a screaming fit. He may also have been upset that you're trying to take away from the surprise of the ring because you're looking for it behind his back. But once again not worth having that big of an argument about. 

One other thing is that he blew up about you not respecting his privacy and then immediately goes to calling you a cheater unwarranted. Is it possible he freaked out because he might be cheating and worried about you going through his stuff? A lot of cheaters project their wrong doings on to their partners."
"I think the above poster really kind of nailed it. The 'asking permission' thing alone was weird but your subsequent comments show a guy who is who is borderline controlling but tries to do it in a joking way as if to play it off when she gets mad/annoyed. Does he tell you that you are overreacting if you get upset when he tries to push you towards something in this joking manner?

He keeps testing you and pushing your boundaries and seeing how far it can go. Maybe you will be lucky and this is all he will ever do or maybe you will be unlucky and he will get violent/abusive. I think you need to nip this behavior in the bud right now. When he makes one of his joking comments, call him out or walk away. Don't argue back or try to get him to see your view point. Tell him that the way he is speaking/treating you is wrong and even if he is just joking that you don't appreciate it. If he can't stop or his behavior escalates then you have your answer right there."
"Id say hire her as well. Your boyfriends cheating has nothing to do with this girls talent and hard work. I work in tech as well and I'd like to shake the stigma of women working in tech. Good candidates regardless of gender are hard to find, especially good talkers and typers."
"I was hoping it wouldn't have to come to that. Despite all differences in my family, I never wanted to cut anyone out. But now, I suppose, it's gone too far. You're right! My sister is turning forty this year and is trying to cut down a 23 year old! Luckily, my daughter is never alone with her, so I am able to monitor everything.

"A few things you can do,

- Bring her a plush cat, if you can find one that has the same colors that'd be great.
- Ask her questions about the cat's care and favorite things.
- Take notes of things she tells you.
- Give her some space to say goodbye
- Thank her for trusting you with the cat's care and promise to do the best job you can."
"Sounds like she may be an anxious body, which is why she feels the need to bring it up *immediately.* it’s a problem with her, not you. She needs to work on controlling those anxious thoughts."
"In the laundry? Possible. Likely, even, if it's shared laundry. 

I've found tons of socks that aren't mine. 

I even found *in my dresser drawer* a pair of *boys boxers*. Like little kids boxers. I do not have kids. I haven't dated anyone with young kids. Idk HOW I would have folded *boys boxers* and placed them in my dresser but it happened. 

He's clearly fucking lying. 

Like if I found my ex's underwear I would legit tell my partner and have a good laugh like ""Ew lol I found a pair of ""Mike's"" tighty whities today"". 

He either kept the thong as a souvenir, or the other woman knows he's attached and was trying to send you a message."
"He is 33...well past the point of getting his shit together.   I understand when people have decided to change jobs or go back to school and they are having financial issues at that age, but that does not seem to be the case.  As a 33 year old myself, I could never imagine asking my SO for rent money especially when it sounds like this guy can easily make more money.

You are 23, there is no reason you need a child 10 years your senior.  I highly doubt at his age this behavior will suddenly change.  If you really care for him, I would give him an ultimatum to work more.   He is taking advantage of you...it is that simple."
"Congrats! Just wanted to point out that it is not a 'faux pas' to have asked about splitting the check. In fact, some people judge dates who assume they will be paid for quite harshly. Not that it's a problem if he's teasing you about it, just...you didn't do anything wrong! You behaved like a totally normal person. Don't let yourself decide that He knows everything about Dating and you are some Backwards Bad Dater. You know way more then him about dating YOU, which is the dating comfort, instinct, and preference that matters here. The only right dating behaviors are ones where everyone is happy and comfortable."

"&gt;Last night we were going to eat and she asked where I would like to go and I said ""IDK where would you like to go?""

Well, you didn't answer the question, which is annoying. And you are so low effort, you are forcing her to be the decider for everything, which is aggravating. 

You are basically demanding the right to sleepwalk through life, not participating, while everyone around you puts in effort.

My husband and I try to keep this kind of bickering low by committing to just throwing out some ideas, even if we don't care too much.

So your wife says, ""Where would you like to eat?"" and you can reply with a specific restaurant, or a kind of food (""Mexican sounds good!"", or you can give her two to choose from. That's three different ways to participate, which is what she's asking for. 

Our other little rule is that we can't reject a suggestion without also making a replacement one. So if my husband asks where I want to eat, and I say, ""Burger Palace,"" then he can't just say no. He has to say ""no, but I could go for Thai Palace instead."" That helps keep the decision making process rolling along."
"Yeah, I'll try that. Times where we both have a couple hours to just stop and chill without some impending deadline are pretty rare these days.

&gt;With our niece my Dad has stated to me in private that he has seen him being very affectionate with her, putting her on his lap, hugging her for prolonged periods of time, etc. While he had done a few of these things, we wrote it off as him being weird and himself as he always has done strange things like that with the rest of the family. 


You have to be kidding me right now. Listen to your freaking father. If you have seen some of these things happen how are you brushing this off?!"
"When I told my ex-husband (not a doctor, but he made 10K+/month) that I wanted a divorce, he asked, ""Are you really willing to give up this house and your Mercedes?""  Yes, asshole.  Yes I am."

"This I would never truly forgive. Ever. He was more scared of his sister than he loved his own wife and kids. He crippled his own children financially for someone he’s allowed to degrade your mom with impunity.

Your father is weak and unworthy of esteem. Don’t bend. No mercy. He needs to feel the consequences of his actions- his children no longer trust him or hold him in regard. That is the cost."
Number one answer. Don’t even give her the benefit of an “O” in front of the “K”.
"If people think it's your mom's fault, it's probably because your dad has been telling them as much. Personally I would consistently respond to the peanut gallery with ""Well, maybe he shouldn't have cheated on her."" then rinse and repeat. If they ask for details, you can either tell them to mind their own business or simply refuse to answer/walk away. 

Your mom is being an absolute saint IMHO. Support her as best you can, maybe take her on a spa day for the two of you if you can manage it, or a low budget picnic."
"&gt;He suggested a compromise that they move in for six months and I agreed

You said you were okay with something you're not. You need to have another conversation and be honest with him.

&amp;#x200B;

My hunch is that six months will turn into a year or more. Moving sucks...who wants to uproot their life twice in a year?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I'm assuming the need for a roommate is a financial issue. Have you offered to increase your portion of rent (assuming you're paying) to help offset this loss of rental income? (He would have to increase as well, of course.)"
"I’m glad we’re not crazy lol. Honestly we’re just so stumped. I know my parents covered my auntie’s mortgage payments sometimes because her husband sucks and she’s too lazy and uppity to get a freaking job. My parents didn’t want my cousins to be homeless. That’s actually cool of them. But tuition? That’s not something you need to survive, and again, NONE of them worked. How do you pay for your nephew/nieces tuitions when you son is out in the cold delivering pizzas until 2 am almost every day, ffs."
"I can understand why you are hurt but I also don't think your husband did anything wrong. 

You gained a lot of weight and your husband was no longer attracted to you. He didn't cheat on you, he didn't abandon you, he didn't insult you and your body or shame you, he didn't do anything that would normally be seen as a betrayal. He was no longer physically attracted to you and as a result he didn't engage in the physical intimacy that you wanted. But I don't think it's fair to expect someone to have sex with you no matter how they feel. He's a person, and if he isn't aroused and comfortable having sex do you really want him to just push himself and do it so as not to hurt your feelings? It sounds like he did sometimes, and it felt like a ""pity fuck"" so you didn't like it anyway. So even if he did that more (which is unfair thing to ask), it wouldn't have been what you wanted.

It sounds like your husband wasn't physically attracted to you but still loved you, still was loyal to you, and still cared about your feelings. All he did ""wrong"" was not pretend to be into sex that he wasn't and force himself to have it super regularly for years when he wasn't aroused? Is that really something you wanted him to do?

I think what you wanted is your husband to want you sexually no matter what your body is like. And I can understand why one would want that. There's a comfort and security in feeling like no matter what your body is like this person will always think you are sexy so you don't need to worry about taking care of yourself. But your husband can't control being attracted to you. What he can control is staying with you even when he wasn't attracted because he loves you for more then just sex. And you have that. You have a guy who loves you as a person so much he didn't even consider leaving even with sex and attraction off the table for him. You can leave him if you want, you can resent him for things beyond his control, but you'll be leaving someone who you have proof will stick with you no matter what."
"You know how this goes. Since she didn't want to be confronted with this, she attacked you with everything she could. Her reaction tells everything you need to understand about a future with her. There will be no calm discussion, only deflection and accusation. There's a very clear double standard, the hypocrisy is huge. If you're at issue for merely looking there, then what is it to post there?

The real problem in this relationship is not in her actions but her response to being found out. Take that for the cue it is."
"Best solution is never to be alone with the kid anymore, never being alone means he can never make up stuff as you'll always have witnesses. What a shitty thing to do. I'm sorry you're being treated this way. I wonder what your little bro's damage is, why is he trying to turn them against you?"
"I don't think this has anything to do with communication. This is him lambasting you for not having a job when he's heavily contributed to that situation by relocating to places with no work. In addition he's now gelling at you AFTER getting a job.

Communicating won't improve this situation. He needs to stop blaming you for something that isn't even a problem anymore and one which he had a large part in creating to begin with."
"""I'm so keen to preserve my own emotional energy that I'd rather you sacrifice yours""

I'm gonna have to remember this the next time I tell my spouse that I don't care what we do. Nothing as serious as OP, but it's thoughtful."
"So he doesn't want to cut back on work... He doesn't want to help with child care... He doesn't want you to get help with your future kid..

He wants you to quit your job... He wants you to sacrifice your joy for him (again)... AND he demeans your contribution to your advancement as a family unit.

But he wants kids.

Why does he want them if he doesn't want to do anything to be actively part of their lives? Seems he isn't happy unless you are unhappy. This looks more like a way to lock you down so he can continue what he enjoys while sucking any independence from you.

Don't try to block out your thoughts but think about them fully. Consider things in the long run. Insist kids are off the table unless he goes to counseling for his God complex and you both go for your relationship. Preferably one you researched and selected. Last thing you need is some Dr. Friend of his making you doubt yourself and manipulating you for your SO's benefit."
"Give her the job. You've already stated how much of an asset she would be to your business. The two victims in this were yourself and that woman who had no idea your boyfriend was in a relationship all those years ago. 
If you don't hire her to relieve your boyfriends shame. Sorry hun but you are the next one to ride the shame train. You seem like a highly intelligent woman and empathetic I have a feeling this will become something you may regret as soon as you've made a decision or later on. 
And you yourself don't seem to have a more legitimate reason for not hiring her, so thus unless your transparent to your team about why you would oppose to hiring her. You'd be lying to your team also."
"&gt; He assured me that he would try anything with me 

&gt; We tried to eat somewhere new and he was moody the whole time

God, that sounds miserable. Not only is he extremely picky, he'd rather sulk than try to enjoy the date. This is definitely not a small or stupid thing to break up over."
"I have faced this and needed to keep the reference. I have said I was a lesbian. I have made up a boyfriend. I have said I have an STD. 

You can nip it in the bud. But that can burn the reference.

Another strategy I have used is to start giving them ideas on how to fix the marriage. Become his marriage cheerleader. Send him hotel ideas that his wife will love. Send him restaurant ideas his wife will love. I went full stalker. I tracked down the wife on social media, saw what she liked and then kept slamming him with recommendations on ways to reconnect.

I kept saying how a marriage is something beautiful and it needs work.  It deserves 100% effort on trying to fix it before giving up. I became such a cheerleader for his marriage he very quickly stopped making overtures."
"He's not just rude, he's emotionally abusive. He's gotten away with it for so long with no consequences. Give him consequences. Walk away when he talks to you like that. Tell him that you refuse to be spoken to that way. Tell him that he is verbally abusive and disrespectful speaking to you like that.

Please see a therapist, on your own. Couples counseling is not recommended for a couple where one partner is abusive."
"Never share too much at work.

You might want to slow things down and respond less to her attention. Give her short answers and don't be available for socializing. Maybe she'll get bored and move on."
"One of my favourite things Ive read on Reddit was about a lady that found our her partner cheated and just disappeared out if his life. 

For a couple months she did nothing and pretend everything was as usual. She even faked the bedroom.

 In the mean time in secret she slowly got all her things ready, saved up money and just left.

She made sure there was no trace of her and no way for him to contact her, ever.

To be honest I have to take my hat of for that lady's self control and pride cause I dont think I could have done that.

How you handle this is completely up to you but you don't own him anything.

Good luck and know you deserve 110% better."
"It's a little bit alarming that she told them what you had said about them when she had started the conversation. Spending a lot of time with family is one thing, but that hints at a lack of boundaries that could become a big problem. It won't, necessarily, but it could.

You say she ""blew up at you about it"", what was her exact concern?"
"The problem is that by you being passive all the time, SHE has to be constantly active to make up for it. *Someone* has to decide where you eat, so by refusing to participate in the decision-making, the responsibility falls on her every single time. Think about how exhausting that would get over the course of 24 years."
Keep doing what you’re doing. Though I would start talking about compromising and fairness with primarily focusing about the move in plan. (Discuss what each of you want and how to get there)
"You may want to take a step back from your best friend. It can be temporary or permanent, you don’t have to decide right now. If she asks why you have been distant and not hanging out, be completely honest with her. I’m so sorry about what you’ve gone through. I’m barely at the point now where thinking about my own bully at that age doesn’t make me feel sick and panic. It’s hard to move on and some people never do. You don’t have to forgive or ever befriend your bully, but I think you would feel better if you can accept that this is something that happened to you but doesn’t define you."
"It's been my experience that it's usually when people are in their early 20s that they have the most extreme black and white views about right and wrong. Sometimes they cling to a set of ideals in order to have a sense of identity, but that can shift and change as they get older. 

So there is a chance that if you stand back and do nothing, your sister will eventually come around and be more sensible. 

On the other hand some people don't change and it might be that unfortunately this is just the way your sister is. 

Personally I think the best thing you can do is keep being yourself and be true to what you believe in, while still remaining open to the possibility of a better friendship with your sister. That way you don't shut the door on her, but you don't compromise yourself either."
"I would wonder how long this has been going on. Because if you've known her since she was 2, so has he."
"Indeed. Even working just with what we know for sure, he's already acted immature and disrespectful towards his wife, ditching her to handle childcare duties (including the child of this ""friend"") without asking so they could go get high.

Add in this suspicious new snapchat streak, plus his history of infidelity...it's time for an upfront confrontation, for sure."
"You are not required to set yourself on fire in order to keep him warm.  You are not required to set your *relationship* on fire in order to keep him warm.

But that's what you're doing.

You have made *covenants* with your wife, to put her and her needs above the needs of all others, except your own, and to put them at coequal importance with your own needs.

*Nowhere* in there did any of the vows you made to her include the out-clause ""unless some guy who is a pretty good friend but not really close decides to free-load on the couch for months at a time.""

It's time for him to *go*."
This is a power play. I like this.
"1) Never have sex with him again.

2) Don't bother texting the girlfriend...for all you know, it's a dude he asked to cover his butt.

3) As others have suggested, start making a plan. You can move after the baby is born and more stable. You will likely be eligible for alimony. Visit a divorce attorney to start discussing options."
"I’ll just say this: his dismissal of her wants and career has been happening for their entire relationship. He didn’t discuss anything with her before applying for programs or residencies, because he always thought that his work was more important. She supported his ass for years and now he just expects her to roll over again and do what he says. He’s always been like this."
"I'm not sure. She seemed like she really wanted the job when she came to interview, she'd done a lot of research, I could tell. And she followed up with everyone she spoke to afterwards, thanking us personally"
"&gt; If I tell him rather than ask him, he makes jokes that he just won't let me leave the house 

I don't think he's joking.

&gt; Him - Omg you act like you're being battered.

No, you're not. You're acting like a grown adult woman who can't believe her partner is suddenly treating her like he's her father or her parole officer. It also worries me that his mind even went in this direction.

&gt; I don't think this is normal, but he shuts the conversations down so I don't know how to communicate how wrong it is?

It's absolutely not normal. Good news is you're doing a fine job communicating. You've already told him that you find the idea of asking him for permission to do normal adult things unacceptable and instead will be informing him of your plans. Now, carry out that plan. This isn't a communication problem, it's a control problem. He's either going to accept that you're his equal or things are going to fall apart."
"She’s not a little kid any more, that’s why it’s making her uncomfortable. She’s a teenager and going through puberty, having your brother kiss you on the head would be pretty awkward especially when you see couples act that way with each other. I think you just have to accept it’s not appropriate anymore and express affection in different ways."
"Yes, do this! My stepdad IS my dad. He considers me his daughter and even if he and my mom were to get divorced, it would be like if he was my bio father getting divorced from my bio mother. I bet he loves you a lot and would be gratified to know you still want to have a relationship with him. 

On another side of this, my husband’s stepmom (who married his dad when he was an adult, so she never raised him; we just think of her as a good friend) is getting divorced from his dad because his dad is cheating. We haven’t seen or spoken to his dad since, but we’ve made it clear to Stepmom that we are on her side and won’t be cutting her out. She came to my birthday last week; his dad wasn’t invited. 

So these things aren’t unusual. Blood doesn’t matter; love does."
"Thank you for the detailed reply. I didn’t realise that this sort of situation has a name and am now reading up on it.


&gt; tell him he’s making you uncomfortable 

I think this is best as the distancing and indirect methods aren’t working. I have chosen to put it in written form (email to one of his invites). That way there is proof if it goes pear shaped. A lot of his other interactions are in written form too. 


Do you think this will be adequate for him to back off? He has a lot to lose (marriage, etc) if he keeps this up, so I hope he has the sense to back off."
"Your feelings are absolutely justified and it sounds like you’ve tried sharing them with him. This situation sucks and I’m sorry you’re going through it. But please, if you want to leave don’t drag it out any longer. You’ve put your life on hold long enough for this man and it’s time for you to start living for YOU. You’ve been in survival mode for so long and it’s time to THRIVE."
Also are we ignoring that he pretty much wants to punish someone got his own mistakes. Says a lot about his character.
"""Glenn, you seem to have some strong opinions about my professionalism and workplace culture, and you're certainly entitled to have opinions, but I'm letting you know now that I'm not willing to listen to them anymore.  It's becoming a matter of respect at this point, and I don't feel respected by your incessant, obnoxious commentary and advice.  Just like I don't come into your workplace and advise you on how to do your job from a position of complete self-assured ignorance, I'd like you to please extend that same courtesy to me and drop it.  I know you only have good intentions with your feedback, and that's I'm asking you nicely, now, to cut it out.""

You're a mega-badass and the story you told about what happened at work was amazing.  Don't let men talk down to you just because they think they know better, and that applies to your boyfriend doubly so."
"&gt; And he stuck to his guns, he is not cool with me working with this girl.

Why the absolute earth-freezing fuck does your boyfriend think he gets a fraction of a say?"
"I have 10 aunties on my dad’s side, and this one is straight up my most hated one. I know my cousin was engaged years ago and my auntie wanted my dad to pay for the wedding. He told her to take a hike, and that engagement fell apart. She wasn’t happy about that. A while back I took a vacation with my friend. It was a cheap package deal for a week. My best friend put up a pic on fb and my auntie saw it called my parents right away and asked who paid for my vacation. My parents slammed the phone shut (I paid for my vacation btw). She’s just so so insufferable."
"Awww to be 15 again. I don't mean that in a patronizing way, this is just really sweet. Yes, give her your jacket! I'm twice your age and now you have me wanting to steal a hoodie from my boyfriend."
"It’s absolutely time to press the matter.

Not just because of the lack of sex life, but because of his complete refusal to engage or communicate on the issue. At this point, it’s straight-up disrespectful - he knows you’re unhappy, but can’t even do you the basic courtesy of telling you *why* he’s constantly rejecting you, even when you’re asking him directly."
"My ex broke up with me through text. I (stupidly) decided to text him back to get some answers, I then called him, and then it just got messy. As a women, my advice is: DO NOT RESPOND!! She doesn’t care about your feelings, and she is deflecting her own by breaking up through a text. You are 32 years old, don’t waste your time with a 29 year old female who has some “soul searching to do”. It’s obviously she just wants to mess around with other guys or even figure out who she is. If you know who you are as a person, then don’t waste your time on somebody who hasn’t found themselves. Enjoy life, love will come at the right time!!"
"She doesn't want to be the project leader for your life together. She wants to be a partner and a team member, not a team leader."
"Did you look up the number in his phone to see if he had it saved as well? 

I would try calling the number from a different phone in a few days, if you are able to borrow a phone from a friend or call from work, perhaps, so this person won't know it's you. Or try calling from a private number. That's so bizarre, but I would be worried too as she knew WAY too many details about  you for it to be just a random number."
"Personally, I think you have to confirm his (bullshit) story before you call it out. And even then, be vague about how much you know. I base this opinion on my experience interviewing people as a law enforcement officer for the last 10 years.

The problem with starting with something like ""I know you weren't with Paul last night"" is that he can change his story on the fly, since he didn't commit to anything yet. ""oh, yea, I left Paul's place but I was too drunk to walk home, so I went to so-and-so's place instead"". You need to establish his story before you can call him out.

I'd ask how his night went. I'd mention that he looks tired, like he didn't sleep. Like, ""what, did you guys play games all night or what?"" And try to establish where he was and when. Once he commits, then you say, ""okay, I know you're lying to me because Paul called me at xyz time saying you left long before that. But this isn't the first time you've lied to me about being at Paul's house, is it?""

It's hard for him to continue lying because you already caught him in one lie, but since he doesn't know how you know how much you know, lying to you is like walking into a mine field. Coming clean is a safer option.

Just my opinion."
"As another physician, I cringed at what the husband said. yikes! nope!

I love my job but I don't think it's more important that others' jobs because it's medicine. At the end of the day, it's a job, it's not like you're doing it voluntarily. You get paid, just like he gets paid for the job. You both love your jobs and since you've sacrificed more than enough, I think it's his turn to make some compromises/sacrifices."
"I'm not saying that you're wrong, but as someone who has worked in the actual homes of people with serious drug issues (DC social worker) there has never been a moment where I was surprised to learn that they were using/selling/both. And it doesn't take a master's degree to see it when you walk in, either. Hell, it doesn't even take a HS diploma. In short: he knew from the first moment he walked into that apartment what was going on, and as a father he should have turned right back around and never brought his kid in there.

One of the first things that struck me about your post was the opening couple lines: excuses about why he lost his job and his home. The first thing I thought was ""drug issues."" It's a hallmark of addiction that the addict cannot take responsibility for themselves and their problems, because doing so would mean acknowledging their drug problem and having to quit. Which is really damn hard.

Is it *possible* that this guy is really just a victim of a series of unfortunate events? I suppose. But all the alarm bells are going off, and at the very least he's guilty of having horrible judgement and treating you really unfairly (and immaturely) in regards to your very kind gesture of opening up your home to him and his child. That's not the kind of partner you put your neck on the line for."

This screams written-by-a-teenager."
"I don’t think sitting down and putting your sister in her place will work, because at this point it seems like this has been 20 years in the making in some respects. I would keep running interference between her and your daughter, the fact that you’ve been shutting down any mentioned of a percentage cut immediately is fantastic, keep doing those little things, and if they escalate to bigger things, keep doing what you’re doing. 

I’m sure you have, but if not, I would have at least a brief conversation with your daughter about the situation. She’s an adult now and you can have a much more open conversation with her about everything than you could if she was still a teenager. 

The way you write about your family makes it clear that you love them very much and are so proud of your daughter (and I’m sure your son too!), it’s nice to read, and I’m sure you’re a really great mom."
"A thousand times, this. Lazy jerk is hoping that if he treats her like trash she will eventually take herself out. No work. No blame. All the cowardice."
"I am astonished that she thinks it's ethical to see you AND him as individual clients AND both of you as a couple.  I am not a therapist but I work in the field, and it's my understanding that crossing wires between individuals and couples is a recipe for conflicts of interest and pretty universally frowned upon."
"These do not sound like minor things.  These sound like intentionally hurtful remarks made by an individual who knows he can get away with it repeatedly; he is confronted, and thus knows his behavior is wrong--and more importantly, **hurting/humiliating you**\--apologizes, and willfully does it again.

&amp;#x200B;

This is, at best, as dysfunctional dynamic.  You are right to feel hurt and offended, and you are more than justified in feeling put off, angry, betrayed, or whatever other emotion you currently feel.  I hope there is a healthy dose of anger in there, because he is mistreating you, and it needs to end.  


Tell him again that what he's doing is hurting you.  Explain why.  Reaffirm that you love him and want to make the relationship work (if you do), but that you will not tolerate being treated like this.  If he cannot change, you'll be left with no other choice than to leave.  And if he continues, do exactly that.

&amp;#x200B;

It's hard to see the behavior of those we love clearly, but this is not acceptable.  At all.  He is making a **choice** to continue hurting you.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not how an adult speaks to another adult, especially their spouse.  It is not normal, it is not healthy, and it is not loving.  It needs to come to a screeching halt, and if that doesn't happen, you need to examine your options and find healthier, more supportive relationship.  He is not the only person who will love you, and this is **NOT** the treatment you deserve."
You’re right. I’ve allowed him and probably even encouraged at some point to be selfish in our relationship. I’ve been sick of it for a long time but wouldn’t admit it to myself and just survived on hope that at some point in all of this he would maybe think about me for a change yet it’s been 11 years and I’m still waiting and have been pushing my feelings aside for a long time out of love that’s been one sided.
"Well, then he needs to realize you can't get a job unless you have some actual stability.  His career choice is what's hindering you, *not you*! So until he can provide that, he's going to have to be more understanding....or you need to think about if you want to stay married to a twat like this."
I know right? I was crying when he left this morning and dude didn’t give a fuck but here I am so devastated when I shouldn’t be.
"Yup I was coming here to say that. I think you are two smart people who will sort this out, but in the meantime consider getting something very secure like LARC (IUD, implant) so that you don’t get pregnant by accident. 

Side note, the snobbery about “other people raising his kids” is some upper middle income sexist trash"
"This is literally my boyfriend to a T

what worked for us and where I began to see progress is when we sat down and talked about it without using fighting words (i.e when he doesn’t eat my cooking/leftovers and chooses to eat prepackaged meals, it makes me feel like my cooking isn’t good enough) he didn’t know hats how I was looking at the situation

We agreed to start cooking food he’s normally eat packaged, fresh together. It’s been working for us pretty well and I’ve seen an improvement on how he eats less prepackaged foods now. 

Other than that..food is just a pretty touchy subject. Trying to tell someone what they should eat with good intentions aren’t usually gonna give you the outcome you want, try to find a comfortable ground for the both of you!"
"Honestly, I'd be divorcing over this. He took marital funds and/or ran up marital debt to pay for someone else's children without the knowledge or consent of his wife. Were I his wife, I'd find that absolutely unforgivable."
"So you mention your wife's anxiety, but not your own. Do you have a therapist? This is a pretty out-sized reaction to single remark from your wife. How did she say it? Was she being flippant? Or was she 'wound up' as you so kindly put it, because you told her that her (pretty understandable) anxiety about making two major life changes at once was 'not good enough'? 

It seems like both of you are putting a lot of fear and concern on this dog question. Is she going to keep working? Is she worried about how you guys are going to split childcare and house duties once the kid comes? Do you guys equitably split household stuff now? (Are you sure? Are you absolutely sure? Have you asked her lately?) From her perspective, her whole life is about to get a lot harder, and her husband is talking about taking on a brand new responsibility that means the first thing that happens in the morning and the first thing that happens when he comes home - will not be about taking care of the kid or giving her a break or making dinner or anything that would help with this new, levelled-up-hard life. Hopefully it did not go down this way, but in your write up of this conversation, your wife said, ""I don't want to have to take care of a dog and a baby."" And you said, ""It's ok, I will take care of the dog!"" So, you just left unspoken there, the implication that she will take care of the baby? It's cool, you've got the dog! Good luck with that baby, wife! Is it possible her response to all this was less about the dog and more about that?

From your perspective, wife made a single remark that she immediately walked back and .... it's tearing apart your marriage? Suddenly you no longer believe she will be honest with you about her feelings? Also, she broke your heart? Maybe it is time for you to get a little therapy to help you figure out why this felt so hurtful. And definitely it is time to sit down with wife and talk about the household division of labor. There is new labor coming online, and you guys need to make a plan. Maybe if she feels more secure in the amount of parenting and household work you'll be taking on, she'll feel less stressed about adding to that work with another new family member."
I've been a buyer &amp; a department store manager in retail. I can tell by the look alone the rough year. And if there's a tag with a code on it? Oh buddy forget trying to fool me. I'll go and check current stock and figure out down to the *season*.
Finding out these kinds of incompatibilities is the whole point of dating. Cut your loses and find someone you can enjoy a good meal with.
Staying with an abusive spouse for the kids does not help the kids. You are no longer responsible for just yourself. When you become a parent your children are the priority. And staying with your husband is only going to leave your kids with their own trauma to deal with because their mom didn't protect them.
He wants kids because he thinks his slave wife will see to them and he'll just flit around carefree like he's always done.
"Sounds like your wife completely lacks basic empathy and is what I like to call a ""one-downer."" No matter how shitty your day was, her's was worse.  No matter what stupid thing a co-worker of yours did, her co-workers are dumber.  That type of attitude and behavior isn't going to magically change just because you bring it up to her.  You two are going to need to talk with a marriage counselor, and she probably needs to talk with an individual therapist."
Are you both open to marriage counseling?
"&gt;other woman knows he's attached and was trying to send you a message.

Thissssssss 100%"
"Yeah, I’m curious why he wants kids if he doesn’t want to change anything else in his life? Kids are a HUGE adjustment.... It doesn’t sound like he has a realistic understanding of what kids need... or probably what stay at home parenting requires (is he going to be hands on w the kids and house when he gets home from working full time or expect you to have dinner ready while he relaxes...?) ... And what will he do when you’re sick or unavailable?

It may be worth talking to him about why he wants kids and how he sees himself parenting. Maybe some good discussions about what kids need and the household each of you want will help you get more en synch with each other, and if not, that’s still very important information to have going forward."
"Think about this, do you believe your father would really want to accuse his own son of being a pedophile for... idk, fun?

Does your dad have bad judgment otherwise? Does your dad accuse other family of outrageous things? If not then... yeah, maybe look a little closer at your brother.

I was molested by a 20 something year old guy when I was 11. His sisters and family defended him stating there's *no way* he could have done what he did. His fingerprints and other evidence were all over my home from the night he broke in. Prior to this he paid extra attention to me, always laughing and joking with me and wanting to spend time with me. He would invite his sisters and I to hang out in his room despite him drinking and us being so young. He played up being the 'cool brother'. 

Yep, then I woke up to him in my bed and his fingers in places they should never have been. 

This behavior is inappropriate and it's possible your niece is torn because she loves her uncle but he might be making her feel really bad too. Children want adults to be happy. I'm not surprised she's saying to your face it's not weird. 

But it *is* weird."

Delete social media my man. Makes life so much better.
"Ditto this as a resident physician at the end of my training. 

My partner’s career may not be saving lives everyday, but that doesn’t make it less important than mine. Even if just because he is mentally stimulated by it, it’s at least as worthwhile as my own job. 

And he’s supported me immensely in finishing my training. One of the reasons I’m most excited to be done is so that I can take over more of the financial, material, and emotional labour of our household. How could you not WANT to show the person who has supported you through your training how much you appreciate them by providing them an opportunity to pursue their career aspirations, support their personal growth, and enjoy the good life you both have sacrificed so much to build together? I see it all the time but I still don’t understand it."
"This sounds like a pretty good solution for when we eat in. I just want to be able to enjoy a nice dinner eating out as well though. I'm realizing more and more that I'm the one with the problem here though, and maybe I'll just have to endure through it. My family and the few people I've dated before never did this so I didn't realize how common it actually is to eat like that."
"So you don't want to leave him, but you're stuck married to a guy that lies constantly, and then to top it off, he sits in therapy and tries to justify and defend his lying.  What advice are you looking for from that scenario?  he's got a massive honesty issue. You are probably never going to be able to trust him again."
"BINGO OP.

"Plus the guy is nearly 40 years old and should be beyond stupid games like that. When you have worrying signs of control issues with an age gap like this, be extra careful OP."
"Gosh, this was a great way to express this -- OP is just a background character to him.  Her wants, needs and life outside of how it serves him as no value at all.  

She was used to support him financially, emotionally and physically through school and now he wants her to be the caretaker of his kids.  But he doesn't want her to have any type of support in that role, no daycare, no nanny, no family, lest she still find time to have a life of her own.  This isn't even as good as one of those old movies, at least in those the wife had live in help and only had to show up at the country club and cocktail parties in support of his career.

He wants OP to just be a good little girl and keep on being in the background of his great, exciting life, as a drab little drone.  After all, nothing OP does is as important in any way as what the great doctor does.  Wonder if he'll treat the kids the same way too?  He can't go to any of their extracurricular activities as he's much too important to support the background characters in his life.  And God forbid they don't bring glory and honor to the great doctor and maybe, just maybe, turn out to have their own interests and desires."
"Him getting that upset over something so petty likely means he's upset about something else and using this as an excuse. It could be he's freaking out about being a parent, purposely making you 'miss the window. It could be something else. 

Only way to find out is to ask. If he claims it's just the cart thing, call bullshit. Ask him if that little issue is worth blow g up your marriage or does he want to talk about what's really going on with him"
Went into this post thinking you were probably overreacting but honestly I get it. I would feel super disrespected. Though to be fair I would have left when my partner called me a whore. Some stuff is just not forgiveable. And if he's calling you this stuff to your face I'd hate to think of what he's saying behind your back or to other people who speak his native language.

The only time things are “good” between us is when he’s happy but he’s only happy when he gets whatever he wants even if it means I’ve done something that makes me unhappy. My mom said something similar about him wanting to lock me down and also wanting to control me when I changed my Masters program to follow him. But I brushed her off because she’s always been a little too overprotective and has never liked him very much typing this out and reading these responses is making me feel like an idiot and like I should’ve listened her from the get go."

If he continues to put himself in situations that he understands may lead him to cheat, he isn't respecting tour relationship.

"Yep, the first concrete step he can take to redress this *financial betrayal* is 1000% financial transparency.

Gonna be honest, I loathe having to deal with finances, and if I were in your position (and unwilling to divorce) I would probably just start figuring out how to fully separate finances (despite being married). I would talk to a lawyer to figure out how to make sure he can't take out loans against joint assets (like the house), and what liability might remain if he tanks his (separate) credit while I remain married to him.

Actions have consequences. He betrayed you into a *serious* joint debt, so the logical reaction is to remove his ability to ever do that again."
"The bathroom one I really do not understand because he washes his hands in public bathrooms, but says no one needs to do this at home? 

The shoes thing is really because we have carpet in our house and I can’t keep doing deep cleans. We have slippers but he never remembers. He says it’s not that dirty out there but we live in a big city and I’m pretty sure he steps in a lot of gunky puddles and stuff on his way to work. 

The issue is I don’t know how to bring it up now because it seems like people get so offended. I mentioned the shoe thing at work and everyone just laughed and said “welcome to America.” Even with the handwashing part, some people got offended because I implied it was gross to me to not wash your hands after peeing."

On a more practical side of things, write down everything you want in a man and every dealbreaker you don't want. The next time you date remember your list, and quickly and ruthlessly cut off guys that are not right for you. Hold off getting attached until you are sure that they are showing you who they really are. This lets you make rational decisions. Believe actions more than words. Do not make excuses for bad behaviors."

Don't worry about the speech, but you should talk to your dad more about the relationship. This woman is joining your family...do you want it to be like this forever? Are you close to your dad/see him often? Will you guys be there for holidays? Have kids and bring them to visit grandpa? 


Talk to your dad about how you really want him and your fiance to get along because they are both so important to you. Ask him if there's anyway you can make that happen, and if you can talk to your fiance about the incident. Tell him that, in general, you are going to talk to her about wanting them to be closer and more comfortable with each other. Stress how important both of them are to you."
"&gt;I care about the guy I have been hooking up with

Why would you care about someone who just wants you as a f-ckbuddy and tries to make sure you'll stay his f-ckbuddy"
"Unfortunately, I have met a lot of people lately that don’t eat leftovers. Which is weird for me because I literally thought everyone does. Like what do you do with all that food?"
"I have no Native American friends. All I know about Native American culture is what I learned in school, from a scholar I spoke to once online, and Canadian museums. My husband and I adore the art work of the coastal salish people. I also enjoy visiting totem poles and learning more about First Nations when I visit BC. I am clearly ignorant as fuck. 


And yet I would never say anything this family has said cause I am not cruel. I am not prejudice. Do I wanna know more about your culture? Yes! If you mention some food, I'm googling it once you leave. I'll love to ask you questions, but I also am not an asshole who expects you to teach me anything. So, I thought this post was going to be your boyfriend's mom talking about Thunderbird Park on Vancouver Island when you're part of of the Navajo nation, thousands of miles away, or asking a ton of questions on some food she found via Google. Typical annoying stuff, but not cruel. Just ignorant. 


Well, sadly, your post is full of them being cruel to you based on dated thoughts of indigenous people. It's horrific honestly. Your example of the statue is easily likened to blackface, which you easily showed in your post. It's gross. Idk why your boyfriend doesn't see that. I can give you advice on how to handle it though from my experiences growing up as half Hispanic with the white family I was placed with who were racist as fuck. 



* Reject the food or drink if they call it names which demean you or your culture. 


* Everytime they say something cruel or tell a horrific story, stand up and say, ""Actually, I don't think this is very funny."" If they do it again, ""As I said, this isn't funny. I'm going home now.""


Grey rocking is good too. You need to leave though even if it means your boyfriend doesn't come with you. There are people out there who will come with you, who will stand up to their racist families, so if he keeps on staying behind, you know what to do."
He hasn't made her feel wanted in over a year and she's supposed to beg to give him a blowjob?
"I've got an infant, and my husband got pretty anxious during my pregnancy, so I fully empathize. He usually defers to my own decisions about my body, but for a while he was fretting over things like whether all the sparkling water I was drinking could be bad for the fetus. 🙄 His stress was stressing *me* out. 

What worked for us was that I went along with him up to a point: I looked up a specific paper that showed that sparkling water in pregnancy is ok. He thanked me for humoring him, and acknowledged he was being a stress case. I made him bring up the things he worried about at the doctor's appointments, so a neutral party could tell him it was ok. I also made him read the book *Expecting Better* by Emily Oster, so he could get a better understanding of all the dos and don'ts of pregnancy. I gifted him the book *The Expectant Father,* which he really liked because he felt like it understood fathers and gave him a better idea of what was going on with me and the baby. 


Hope this was helpful! Feel free to PM me."
I didn’t even read most of this because when I got to the driving and screaming at your dad part I thought “this guy is abusive”.
"This, it identifies the relationship without being rude or awkward."
"I know, when I first heard the story it made my skin crawl. I just feel realllly put between a rock and a hard place. You’re not wrong."
"That this kid is less than a year old leaves me to believe that there might be postpartum depression concerns that may need addressing.  Hormones, stress and sleep deprivation are a potent combination when it comes to fucking with your mental stability.

I have a very religious family member who had a psychotic break after the birth of her child, to the point that she had to be involuntarily committed until she could be medicated.  I don't know all the details, but I do know that she was calling herself a different name and would disappear for hours or days at a time.

Talk to her priest and ask him to intercede if you're concerned about her mental state."
"Speaking as a child of divorce:
Happy single parents are better parents together than miserable married ones. I'm glad it turned out that the difficult choice was the right one for your family. Best of luck."
"Honestly he sounds like an asshole. Your comments about how ""he isn't always like this"" etc are rather telling. He insults you in front of your friends too."
"&gt; He says he would do counselling but is dead set against medication. 

So when does he start counseling? 

Seriously, has he researched counselors? Made appointments? Called his insurance company? What steps has he taken here, now that he knows he’s triggering and frightening you?"
"&gt; I don’t know if I should go however. Im afraid of never finding anyone as good as her ever again.

I honestly have yet to see someone (who has actually tried to meet people) have this actually happen. Believe it or not, most people are not still pining for the person they dated in college by the time they’re 30."
He’s probably not willing to go because he will be held accountable for his behaviour and he’s not prepared to do that . Counseling will only be effective if both partners are genuinely committed to making a change
"It's going to be difficult, but you need to set some boundaries. Tell her, ""Mom, I'm only going to look at five links from you in a day. Choose carefully."" Set a boundary like that, and then stick to it. Be friendly and chatty with her about those five things (or however many you're comfortable with), and don't talk about anything else she's sent you that's outside that boundary."
"What's crazy to me is that after presumably **years** of this...you've ""never really thought about it that way""?! Despite her **telling you** you're too passive, you're apparently *so* passive that you can't even take on board the idea of *being* too passive."
"Don’t tell him that you don’t like her. Let him know that you don’t feel comfortable with her around all the time and that sometimes you need space in your own home. If he wants to live with her, that’s totally understandable but they should find their own place. I would let him know that it would be no hard feelings if he wanted to move out to get a place with her but that you’d appreciate it if he could help find a replacement before he goes."
"Oh my goodness, my friend, I am so very very sorry for you and your mom.  This is a horrible situation and I am sure it is horrible to be living through it right now.

Yes, he is abusive.  Very.

Yes, like most abusive people, he has a ""golden side.""   And what you see when he is fun, giving good advice, helping you out, is genuine.  But when certain stimuli hit him, he is unable to unwilling to control himself and he goes completely round the twist.  But no matter how good he is 95% or 99% of the time, abuse is abuse.  I'm so sorry but this is not a close call.  Your dad is abusive.

Let's not talk about what happens if you call the police.  Let's talk about what happens if you \*don't\*.  The data show that almost without exception, the abuse will worsen.  If he was close to hitting you today, at some point he will hit you.  Then he will be talking to the police and being charged with assault and maybe going to jail.  The point I'm making is that if you call the police now, bad things may happen to him.  But worse things will happen to you AND to him if you have to call the police after it has escalated.

May I first suggest you (and your mom, but separately) call the National Domestic Violence hotline at 1-800-799-7233.?   Domestic violence/ abuse has very predictable patterns, and it evokes predictable responses in victims (like you).  These people talk to families with abuse every day of the year, and will be able to give you much better advice about \*your specific situation\* than you will get on reddit.  

If I had to give you advice, and couldn't access a professional, I think the best approach would be to speak to him in a few hours or tomorrow when he's cooled down.  Probably better tomorrow so you can think it over, plan what you want to say, and so  it will come across as something that you've thought about, not something you'll say in the heat of the moment.  I would say ""Dad, what you did last night was emotionally abusive and close to violent - I was terrified.  It was completely inappropriate.  I have thought about it, and I want you to understand that you have a problem and need help.  I can't make you get help but I wish you would.  But in any case, if anything even close to that every happens again, even for one second, I am calling the police.  If you cannot control this behavior and it happens again my only option will be to get outside help.  Pause her for five seconds - count to five slowly.  Please understand that I am completely serious and will follow through on what I have said.""  If you wish, you can finish by saying ""You are a great person, I love you, you've done many good things for me.  But nothing excuses abuse, not even a tiny bit of abuse.  I want us to have a great relationship - please make that possible.""   \[Don't lead with the positive.  Lead with laying down the law.  You can finish with saying you want to maintain your relationship and he's wonderful, but don't start with it.  It's psychologically complicated but if you lead with how much you like him, he won't take the warning seriously.

It wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing to call the cops now, just so he gets a societal reprimand now.  He isn't going to be sent to jail for one episode of yelling and threatening.  Bu the threat of external intervention actually works with most abusers.   The advantage of giving him one warning is that he can't give you shit about how ""You never gave me a chance to fix this"" etc.

My heart goes out to you and your mom.  I wish you both the best."
"you need to break up with her. this is not a healthy relationship whatsoever. if she is refusing therapy, there is no way to fix this. you should not build a life with someone who throws fits and tantrums over you not being in the mood or mindset to have sex. especially when mourning or after getting out of the hospital. she needs to respect your wishes and feelings. this is honestly unbelievable, she sounds like a terrible person to be with."
"You made a good point about the assets-- I know a couple who divorced where the husband offered her the house if he could have all of the other assets...... and she took the deal. To be fair, her attorney was pretty horrible, but she felt such an emotional connection with the house that she wanted it. Such a horrible decision. OP, get help from professionals on all of this because it matters so much. A good lawyer vs a mediocre one can actually be a big deal, as is getting financial advice. They'll have your back, including stopping you from making poor decisions in the moment like my friend did."
Why are you putting up with this?!?! Dump👏🏼 his👏🏼 ass👏🏼
"I don't think he loves that I manage the finances, but I have access to my own bank account and we have a joint account, and I'm much better at budgeting. We are in a good financial place today because of my budgeting and figuring some of his debt out, I would say. He used to manage everything but was not making smart decisions so I took over. The fact that he's never been abusive with money also just makes it hard to reconcile sometimes if how he's acting is really so wrong. Just confusing."
"Yeah. 

Girl you need to leave him. 

It doesn’t get any better."
"I can't quote it on mobile but that line in paragraph 2 about him not being able to handle the promotion at his old job and the PTO denial are clear indications that this is not a one time thing, it's business as usual for him."
"Men who say that they ""don't want other people raising their kids"" almost NEVER intend to quit their jobs and do it themselves.  It's sexist AF."
"&gt; he is faithful

Is he? He already cheated on you once and lied about it. Has he ever come clean?

I can't believe he got you to apologize when he's the one lying to you. You are underreacting in my opinion. I would sit him down and insist on getting the full truth from him. If you have to bring in the corroborating evidence, do so. You can't marry someone with lies hanging over your head. You've clearly never fully gotten over this, likely because he has never been honest with you about it."
"Mom's douche senses were tingling.

You're not an idiot you trusted your spouse... The man you loved. As one ought to feel safe doing. Before rushing into either leaving him or having kids consider if he would actually make an effort to go to couples counselling. Thing is his demeaning demeanour seems to be deep seeded. So tread carefully. Best of luck op!"
"Dude, she's sexually abusing you. Get out."
"Wait, this woman is *thirty-five* *years old* and acts this way?"
"I think you need to tell him that he’s making you feel this way. 

If he loves and respects you he’ll dial back his interest to foreplay only - and also ask you how much you’re comfortable in indulging his kinks. He should offer some remorse for making you feel like an object - and be open and willing to discuss both of your sexual wants and needs. 

If he’s truly stuck on you for fitting in his kinky mold and that’s it, you’ll know. Because he won’t offer to dial it back, he will most likely talk only about how much you/your condition turns him on. He will want to know what’s wrong with that. Or He might agree to dial it back and it will last two days. It will become apparent that he cares more about his boner than your physical and mental well-being.

So there’s my two cents. Talk to him and tell him exactly what you wrote here. The answer to leaving him or not will lie in his *actions* after having the talk."
"Deal breaker here. 

My husband of 30 years underwent a two year slide to hell, near death, and a hailmary deathbed organ transplant (liver) in January caused by an undiagnosed autoimmune problem. 

You don't want this.  If bf is uncompliant now it will only get worse and if you think you're scared now,it has only begun. 

Is marry my husband again even after all this horror...but he is super compliant with his bazillion dollar problem.  

Honey trust me you don't want to sign the dnr, tell your (future) kids that dad is dying, and watch him go down the tubes. Your anger at his nonchalance will never end. Talk to a therapist please.

He can let himself go but you don't have to take that ride."
"Why are you with this guy?!!!  He's clearly not interested in anything important in your life.  You're not asking too much, you're asking what is expected of a SO in a relationship.  You have given him a pass on this for too long."
"[deeply impressed stare] 

I want to be like ""but that's not your job, it's horrible that you were forced to do all that extra emotional labor just to protect yourself from being harassed and discriminated against, he deserved to just get sued into oblivion"" but this is just so beautiful? It is simultaneously the perfect Machiavellian plot and an incredibly kind thing to do for someone who doesn't deserve it. You deserve some kind of Maximum Slytherpuff Award."
this is such a good idea!!! And will give you straight forward non biased evidence on what is actually going on here.
"Am American, and live with another American. He is from Hawaii so taking off one’s shoes is the norm, as with many Asian Americans and Canadians I know. Furthermore, every person I know showers with soap and washes hands after using the restroom. 

All of this to say...his lack of hygiene and respect is NOT remotely an intrinsic American trait."
"In your post you referred to her as ""our therapist."" You need someone you can refer to confidently as ""my therapist."" It is important for you to have your *own* support system as you work through this. If I were you, I would start individual therapy with a new provider going forward, because that dynamic has now shifted."
"Op, your in-laws are not the issue here. Your partner is!!!!! 

Get away from him now! He's a big child who can't say no to his parents and will literally let them do anything they want! Even now that your in-laws did such a disgustingly creepy thing your partner is taking their side and pretending you are the crazy one. He doesn't care about you, he cares about what his parents think and how they will react. 

 Document everything he and his crazy parents did and said, and send it to a lawyer asap!!! If you can find any texts or get your partner to admit to it in text, do so, and send that to your lawyer. Then get out! Now! Why are you with someone who will literally sneaks around because his mommy and daddy told him to!? You are with a big cowardly baby who let his parents violate your privacy to assuage their parnoid fantasies! They sound crazy!!! And he is complicit in this insanity!! Is this real life or are you fucking around!?"
"Not only did you do the right thing, but your boss is behind you.  That’s great!

Boyfriend needs to re-evaluate or be re-evaluated by you.  My fear is that he is putting you down because he is threatened and possibly misogynistic himself, to an extent.  The age gap is another clue (a clue that girls his age wouldn’t put up with his shit.)"
I also recommend having some ready-made dinners for these days.
"&gt;dont want to break up with something as simple as food

Real talk: you wouldn't be breaking up over something as simple as food. What's going on here is an incompatibility in values. Food is a manifestation of this right now. Sharing an experience with your partner is something that's clearly a huge deal to you, but it's not to him. If you continue this relationship, you'd probably see the pattern repeating:

\-You want to try a new experience together.

\-He says he'll do it

\-He doesn't. 

\-He sulks. 

This isn't a bad reason to break up - it's what this early relationship phase is for, discovering if you're on the same page. And it seems like you're not."
"I have, as did her parents but whether or not she does go and seek help is something I can’t control."
"After reading your original post, I'm proud to hear that you made your stand and stood your ground. Many don't. Here's to you and to the world of possibilities you've opened up for yourself. Well done, ma'am. Well done."
"This actually happened to me but backwards.  I dated a guy and years after we had broken up (he was a serial cheater, but super good at lying) actually sent me a picture of a xs Victoria secret thong and said “found your old thong in my closet from when we dated 5 years ago” and I just knewwww his gf had found a thong and he was cheating playing it off like they were mine ... needless to say.. I’m not an xs and they were not my underwear... the girl knew."
"This started off seeming plausible at the start of your post, seemed a little suspicious when you mentioned it was just this one time, concerning when his response was that if you went he’d go do something worse and definite red flag when you mentioned he’s casually dated some of the girls from the group. It sounds to me like he’s maybe got a ‘casual’ thing with one of the girls from the group and doesn’t want to have her come up and say something to him in front of you. Perhaps he’s kept it a secret from the group hence if he doesn’t go, he won’t be exposed.

I also think it wa uncool of him to try to claim that as ‘his’ thing when it was literally a shared thing and the way that you met - plus you also share the friend group because you’ve been out with them. If it were me, I’d be ‘spontaneously’ turning up to some of the next games. The more mature approach is probably to tell him that you’re hurt, that it was s joint thing and it’s how you met and you know the group, so you don’t want to be excluded."
"A heart attack at 24 is so crazy.  He is an addict, he's addicted to food.  You can't save an addict. If he doesn't wake up from this incident, there is nothing you can say or do to get him to change.  It's may be time to end it."
"You set the bar low and then you drag him over it.  You are doing all of the work.

But you aren't going to turn lead into gold.  

Trust me, I get it.  Some of us like to believe that if we just say the right words or do the right thing at the right time, that we can fix a problem.  But you've tried everything to get the smallest bit of effort out of him and come back with *nothing*.

Why not put that effort into yourself?  And later, into a healthy relationship where you're respected and your efforts are reciprocated?"
"This 1000%. You're literally the reason alimony was invented, OP. You sacrificed your career for his future earning potential, so you're entitled to collect on your investment."
"She defaults to ""you're being controlling.""  MAJOR red flag.

She wants to be single, so let her be single and find yourself someone who doesn't act like a 12 year old.

No offense to 12 year olds."
"This is just my opinion but, respecting your dad is allowing the narrative that disrespects your mom to continue. I'm curious as to how your cousin got to ""toxic"", because that sounds like your dad has been talking about your mother quite poorly to your extended family. 

Again, this is just me, but at that point I would be asking my father what the hell he has been telling the family for them to be talking so poorly about your mother. I would also tell my cousin to fuck off, but I'm not very eloquent."
He should go over and play with the new little kid a lot and then he can be the cool older cousin.
"Look at the *best* possible case for what happened: he got drunk and fooled around quite extensively with her.  That's the *best*-case scenario, and the rest of the list goes downhill until it hits a hard stop at ""sexual assault"".

You can say all you like that you were in no position to leave and had to make the best of it.  But that was then.  And the fact that you and he have been fine ""for the most part"" (and such a ringing endorsement *that* is) doesn't change the fact that, at best he's a revenge cheater and at worst he's a sex offender.

So stop trying to pretend that everyone should be OK with him.  

If I were you, I'd be gone.  No.  Scratch that.  If *I* were you, I'd have been gone long ago.  But if this is the person you choose to associate with, do not be surprised when people judge you based on what they know of him, and based on your willingness to bind yourself to someone who is capable of doing those sorts of things."
"I would just be direct and say “I get the impression lately that you might think we’re dating. If I’m misreading things I’m really sorry, but I value our friendship too much to lead you on. I’m not interested in being more than friends.” But if direct isn’t your style you could be like,  “Hey, it makes me really uncomfortable that you always pay for me. I’ve had guys do that and then expect things, and it throws me off. I need us to split the check from now on. I’m hoping as my friend you’ll understand.”"
"You are not being whiny. WHAT A HUGE ACCOMPLISHMENT !! If she won't value your hard work, you need to. You've spent your whole life working up to this moment, of course you would want to share it with someone and celebrate. I hope you've learned the value of hardwork, and of keeping a commitment/your word, so you can reciprocate that to people you care for and give them the support and appreciation they need at times like this! I'm very proud of you. Its fair to be upset with your mom, but don't let her poor choices and lack of priority ruin a fantastic and much deserved celebration of your accomplishments."
Honestly I'd keep your job and the freedom your own money provides until you figure this out and though it should go without saying do not add kids to the mix until you guys can get on top of this (or get out of this).
"&gt;Truth is I still love her too, very much so, and she has never been like this with me, ever.

Actually, she has:

&gt;**She thinks I’m acting like a little girl**, he has to lose weight, I’m doing it out of love, 

&gt;but then she turns the tables on me and **starts calling me “weak” and “pathetic” and that a real man would have broke the homeless man’s neck** for bothering her with his disgusting smell.

Make no mistake that the longer the relationship lasts, the more she'll turn this behavior on you whenever she's angry or feels like you're not doing what she wants. Then it may escalate into an every day occurance. Don't think you're safe because you're in a relationship with her. You're more than likely signing yourself up to suffer worse than anyone she's encountered as strangers.

&gt;Am I over-reacting?

**You're underreacting.**

&gt;She is the best thing that has ever happened to me

She's going to quickly become the worst thing that's happening to you. Its 8 months in, its the honeymoon stage and she's showing what an awful human being she is. Block her on everything and move on with your life."
"You got dumped in a weird roundabout way, but she's your ex-girlfriend now my man. Take some time to yourself and take it easy."
"&gt; I will immediately told him how sad that makes me. When I do, he kind of just insincerely goes “relax, I’m kidding” but it seems like he more just wants to change the subject 

Don't change the subject, and don't tell him it makes you sad. **Have a real conversation.** Why does he feel that way about daughters? You need to get to the bottom of this and make absolutely cast-iron certain that if you have a girl he will treat her **exactly** the same as he would a son, in every way that matters. It's not a ""cross that bridge"" problem, because this isn't going away, and you don't want to invest 5 more years of your life with him only to *then* discover this is some major dealbreaker. You don't have to level accusations against him, just emphasise that this isn't a topic you're willing to joke about, and you insist on having a proper conversation about children, parenting approaches, boys vs girls, etc. It's **vital** before moving forwards with having children."
"That sucks.

I’ve found for me that I kind of go in friend “cycles”- every couple of years or so I’ll suddenly have tons of friends, be getting invited to fun events, have plans all week/weekend, just feel really popular... and then things start shifting as people move away or get jobs other places (if they were work friends) or just grow apart. It happens. The falling apart phase feels awful though. 

I personally let myself feel pretty sad for a while, but I also try to initiate one on one things with the people I do know like me, and try to plan at least one thing every few weeks with someone I haven’t seen in awhile. Sometimes the connection is still there, sometimes it isn’t, and I try not to get hurt if it isn’t. I also try and make new friends however I can, and I make sure that I never turn down an invitation- if I had to guess I’d say 80% of success in new-friend-making is consistently showing up. I never bail. I also try to initiate more, which is hard for me because I do lean more introverted, but I try to force myself to see if someone wants to get coffee/lunch if I think they’re cool. I only ever ask once though and if they say yes, great, and if not I just let that go. No point in forcing it.

I guess that’s my perspective on your old friend group too- you can’t force it. I’d grieve the end of that friendship however feels right for you, and then focus on doing things that you enjoy and see if you make some new connections that way. 

Good luck :)"
"&gt;One thing young people try out as they grow up is setting personal boundaries.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the most amazing gifts OP can give his sister right now is respect. Respecting her personal boundaries, teaching her during this key developmental age that her boundaries should be respected. Really glad to hear he listened to her right away. Just pointing this out so he can see the good in what happened instead of just feeling hurt."
"I certainly am, he would be if I pressed the matter."
"Honestly, people throw it around a lot and it’s impossible to diagnose people off of a tiny snippet of information on the internet, but this woman genuinely sounds like she’s on the anti-social personality disorder spectrum. People with ASPD are capable of being INCREDIBLY charming and charismatic, when it suits them, but have no genuine empathy or concern for others. They can mirror good behaviour and sometimes VERY well, but it’s acting, not genuine. For some reason she wants you as a partner, so of course she is crazy wonderful to you, but her actual, inner disregard for people’s feelings is apparent in her other actions. 

People with ASPD can’t feel empathy, they can’t feel compassion, and they can’t feel love. She doesn’t love you, she wants you in her web. You’ve done the right thing getting out, now stay out before she turns OFF the charm and turns ON the dangerous behaviours. She seems to take true delight in causing misery in other people, and that’s really scary."
"This sounds like a good way to start, I suspect that he’s at the pub with her now, I’m going to wait until he gets back to say anything. 

Thank you"
So now it's your job to be a good parent to him since his were bad? Like you aren't allowed to be mad at him because that will justify him continuing to lie to you?
You can control whether you put up with her not taking care of her mental health for the sake of the relationship. She doesn't get to be with you without going to a therapist
OP try this! I know a couple who had a similar issue and having plastic cutlery helped a lot!
"Maybe I'm the only one, but my parents had a lock on their bedroom door. We stayed up late watching TV or playing video games, they would chill in their room doing whatever kid free activities they wanted. This wasn't an every night thing but we knew what privacy was and had no issue with it. 11 is old enough in my opinion for her to do her own thing. 

Another option, send her to her friends house to spend the night a few times a month. Have her friends over to your house, rent them some movies or whatever the equivalent is for kids these days, and get yourself some ""us"" time."
Op: please be careful. Leaving is the riskiest time for your personal safety. Don’t be alone with him. I get bad vibes from the things he is saying.
You're a good woman/person for seeing that history with such perspective. Don't let your scared bf lead the way here. You are in the right.
I think I’ll just leave no need to hassle about it anymore
"It is different from porn - it’s hiring a virtual sex worker. That’s literally what it is.

Don’t downplay this. You have a right to have your boundaries respected in a monogamous relationship. That’s the toll fee.

He doesn’t respect you or your boundaries. Time to grow a shiny spine and tell him he can’t disrespect you blatantly and get away with it.

Confrontation is the only way forward. Watch out for JADE (justify, argue, deny, explain). What do you think he would say if you told him you found out and how he crossed the one line you drew?"
Get him into something he can take his aggression out with. Boxing. Karate. Weight lifting. Use his anger to motivate him.
"Often when victims of abuse are cornered by their abusers, they might want to take the path of least resistance. No, it's not logical, but trauma really messes with how you handle a dangerous situation. 

For what it's worth, I understand why you did what you did for your husband. You love him and wanted to save him from someone who hurt him, and did what you felt was right in the moment. I think, though, the right thing might have been to remove your husband from the situation entirely or deflect his abusive cousin instead of starting a fight. His wounds have been reopened and he's experiencing a lot that you might not be able to understand. 

Is your husband in therapy? It would be worthwhile to see someone specialized in post traumatic stress disorder who is explicitly LGBT friendly / sensitive and to have sessions together to resolve this conflict. Your husband needs you to listen to him, it's a big part of being part of the team. Should you two be in a situation where his abuser will be present, it's vital to have a game plan. 

For now, I would apologize to him for causing him pain and leave to door open to talk for when he's ready.

""(Husband), I will not push the subject, but I want to apologize for hurting you. I was scared and angry for you, but it's no excuse for getting violent. I want to do right by you and support you however you need. If you want to talk about it, I promise I will listen with an open heart. Perhaps there is something we can do together to make sure I am aware of your boundaries and what you need from me. I love you and I'm here for you."""
"Honestly man, have you... discussed it with her?

How do you know 100% for sure that she's not into you too? You were great friends in high school and even went to prom together. She makes an effort to hang out with you when you're both home from school.

You need to clear the air. Sometime soon, you need to hang out one-on-one somewhere, and have a serious conversation. Tell her what you told us. Because it can go one of two ways:

\#1: She doesn't share your feelings. That's fine. Now you know for sure; things might be a little weird for a while, but you have time to find a different roommate and avoid all kinds of awkward and frustrating situations.

\#2: She reciprocates. Maybe she's had a crush on you this whole time. Women, especially young and immature women, love to drop subtle hints, and young and immature guys miss them. Check out the /r/AskReddit threads like ""Women of reddit, what hints have you dropped that guys have totally missed"" for examples. There's a good chance she thinks you're not into her because you're not getting her hints.

Again, this is why you *clear the air*. Use direct communication.

The truth is, if she falls into the #1 scenario, you were probably going to drift apart before age 30 anyway, you have literally nothing to lose."
"You'be been seeing this guy for a few months. You'd like to make it official, he apparently doesn't know and needs to think about it. That doesn't sound very enthusiastic, so you move on. Not sure if he expected some kind of waiting period, but a 'don't know' is a no, so you went back on the dating apps.

The fact he went into your phone and meddled with your settings, that affects who and how you can be contacted, is a major deal breaker. WTF? A sane person would just have left the phone alone when it is ringing, or if the display is shown and he could see 'Robert' called, he could've said: 'Oh, you have a missed call from a buy named Robert. Who's that?' ."
Nope that’s unforgivable.
"You may have a communication problem.  But the bottom line is this:  your husband is an asshole.  Why are you apologizing to HIM?  For fuck's sake, he's dragged you all over.  THAT'S why you don't have a job.  

Stop blaming yourself and put the blame where it belongs.  And learn to stand up for yourself once in a while."
"Yeah at five months I'd cut my losses and make tracks.

This is just the first of what will likely be a series of red flags leading up to emotional abuse and controlling behavior."
"I think this relationship is done. He's not ever going to give you what you want. Whether this is because he actually isn't that into you, or because he has an extremely passive personality, idk. Expecting things to somehow change after this long is verging on crazy. 

And for the future, look for reciprocation in the relationship early on. Don't put up with things bring one sided for months and years."
"Ooh. I'm a lad. I can field this.

Dump him like toxic waste. I can't think of a worse reason in the world to indefinitely entangle myself legally, financially, and emotionally than a freaking stag party. It's one night! Your marriage is gonna last longer than that. What he's describing is like being excited about being sent to prison because there's a fun bus ride first. WTF.

For what it's worth, I had a friend like him. He dated this girl for like 6 years since high school. She was madly in love with him and wanted to make life plans and he... enjoyed her company. They had a pleasant, boring, utterly one-sided relationship. Eventually, after like a decade, she got so fed up with his lack of investment in her and their future that she wound up cheating on him. They broke up immediately. Like two months later he met this other girl. A year later they were married with a kid on the way.

I'm not going to defend what she did. But I know WHY she did it. 

If this guy wanted to commit to you, he'd do it. But it does not seem like you two are even kinda on the same page about what you want in life and are just together thanks to inertia."
"Totally unforgivable. They planned on killing Jumper and attempted twice. He suffered because of them, and dogs are like family... dogs love and trust their people unconditionally, and they abused that on the worst level.

As far as your relationship with them goes: you don’t have to have one. They sound like they are toxic in a few other areas as well? 

As far as your own heart and mind goes: go talk with a therapist to help you process it properly and move forward, but that doesn’t mean you forget it or Jumper.

Something a grief counselor told my family after my mother’s suicide when I was 25, was, that my youngest sibling would experience her death differently after each large milestone in his life, as he aged he would be able to process it differently, all over again.

I don’t know if grieving a dog would inflict the same grief processing, but I would not be surprised, dogs are so special."
"This level of disrespect for you literally made me sick to my stomach.  I have no advice, but I want to offer support.   I just don’t know howhe comes back from this."
"This period of time is the best part!

You get to enjoy your time together, continue getting to know each other, etc. it’s only been 6 months, don’t try to jump too far ahead into the future. 

Just take things a day at a time and enjoy it! 

Also, if you want more time together, unfortunately you’re just going to have to make it work somehow. Spend a weeknight together, or meet halfway, bring the cat with you, etc. this is what dating and spending time with someone is all about. 

Good luck and don’t think so much about it - just have fun!!"
"Uh... call the cops? Get a blood panel done, get STI tested. This is beyond fucked up."
"I would be seriously considering breaking up with your partner. He never believed you didn't cheat on him until he had irrefutable biological proof and he utterly refuses to stand up to his parents. He also doesn't really seem to care if these things hurt you. If you don't break up, couple's therapy is a must. He's deeply hurt you, and he needs to realize the importance of being on your side."
"Yeaaa..like I'm sorry, what?? Spectrum or not, that key psychopath detail was kinda buried in there.."
"He knows and he knows specifics.  He just doesn't want to.  He's over thirty years old (barely), but by that age, most people have sat down and pressure gauged themselves on just the fantasy of being married.  Does it appeal to them or not?  If not, they just move forward and have the courtesy to tell their partners (present or future).  If it does appeal to them, then that's something they work towards in their relationships and talk about.

I honestly think he doesn't want to get married at all.  I think he's genuinely good with ""not rocking the boat"" by not changing a damn thing and letting life happen to him.  I also think he knows if he told OP that straight up, she would leave and he'd have rocked the boat.  His goal seems to keep everything EXACTLY how it is and has been, going absolutely nowhere.  

Ironically, by doing that, he's going to Singletown.  Which is probably exactly the opposite of what he wants, but it's what he's doing to himself by not doing anything and refusing to take a stance.

Hell, even the fact that he chose not to read this immediately when it concerns his partner's happiness in the relationship (and their potential break up) suggests to me that he's determined to keep things the same by pretending not much is wrong or that OP will just stop arguing.

If my partner sent me a post he made about me, problems in our relationship, AND it had advice or constructive feedback, I'd read that shit immediately.

OP, he's showing you (and has been showing you) how he feels about marriage and being formally committed to you.  If you truly don't want to be perpetually the girlfriend, then you know the next step.  He sure as hell is not going to take it."
"You're young, I'd say don't worry about using a proxy if you're struggling. ""My therapist says it's holding back my therapy that you send me screenshots of your abuse, she says you shouldn't do that any more"", for example."
"Half your mortgage is a lot to pay for someone who has no ownership of the house.  My bf owns the house, We worked out a reasonable rent amount and I pay the electric bill, we split grocery and household costs. I told him flat out I wasn't paying fully half of a mortgage my name was not on."
I agree. Props to Paul.
"At the point that Paul FaceTimed me I was no the wiser, I only checked to see when he sent his last text because I thought something has happened to him, I spoke to Paul earlier he said he was just hungover. 

After boyfriend turned off his phone I tried to call him, he didn’t answer me"
"I had a GF that believed you should never go to sleep upset.  So, if she was upset about something and I didn't pick up on it, she would wait and stew on it until we were in bed before finally bringing it up.  Usually this resulted in some sort of fight keeping us up until 3 am when I have to work in the morning.  Don't miss that."
I’ve suggested it many times. His mom is just completely numb to the situation with him at this point and doesn’t take much initiative. But you’re absolutely right.
I suggest printing out those emails if you can. While it probably won’t happen it is possible for your company to delete them from the back end if they’re on the company email server.
"Is your issue that he's always right or that he always has an answer? Obviously I don't know how exactly you're feeling but, at least with regard to the last example, sometimes I just want to complain about something in my life and receive sympathy instead of a fix. Maybe try asking him to listen and commiserate sometimes instead of always jumping in with what you should be doing instead."
"I'm super glad there are a few MDs in this thread to provide context that this gross response is not in any way ""par for the course."""
"And if you feel something for her, it may hurt when she comes home with other people and kiss and stuff."
"A good start might be telling him: ""you know how you think I'm not judgemental, hence why you came to me with your news, that's what I need from you. You have always bothered me about my weight and if you want to visit me I need a supportive parent."" 
Idk hope this helped."
"So if it's not a big deal why can't you make a decision?  

&amp;#x200B;

To be blunt it's lazy and passive to the point of, well, being disgusting.  You are a 43 yo man with a family and you can't even be bothered to give input on a vacation?  You can't pick a restaurant?

Your apathy implies a lack of care or interest.  *You can't even be bothered to spend time and think about a family vacation!*  You seem completely disinterested in the activities your family takes part in."
"You cannot change him.  The only person who can change him is *him*, and for that to happen, he has to *want* it to happen.  He's giving no indications that he finds anything wrong with the way he behaves, so what possible reason could he have for wanting to change?

When people behave badly, one of the ways they justify it to themselves is ""if it were really actually bad, people would leave"".  Then they look around, and they see...you, a person willing to stick by them even when they are behaving abominably...and they tell themselves ""see? How I'm behaving is fine.""

&gt; I know you’re all probably confused about why I’m friends with this guy but I’ve known him all my life

That's sunk-cost fallacy.

Do not cling to a mistake simply because you have spent a long time making it.

And don't base a friendship on who you wish someone *could* be.  Be friends with them (or not) based on who they *are*:  who they demonstrate, through their actions, themselves to be."
"Girl I’m in the UK as well, so I’m awake and I am so here for this. 

You have the support of thousands of strangers and you have the upper hand in every way. Take lots of deep breaths and take the best advice you get here. You’re going to be dining out on this story for years."
I logically know this is right. I've even thought about what would happen if he did propose. How would I feel. And I think it would just be tainted and I get so angry because it didn't have to be this way. If he really meant what he said then we could have been happy.
"Unless there's more reason to be suspicious I honestly think you're blowing this a little out of proportion. You're 40 and she's 38, which means that 10 years ago you would both have been old enough to have had previous partners, and depending on the length of each relationship maybe quite a few. Now maybe if this guy was your best friend, or they'd been together for a long time/engaged, then I'd think it would be reasonable to be upset, but from what you've said neither seems to be the case. It's likely that it's a part of her life that just seems incidental now.

Do I think she should have told you? I mean yeah, I guess. But there could be a hundred reasons she didn't, ranging from embarrassment to not thinking it was *that* important you had an acquaintance that she dated a decade ago.  The amount that you're struggling to get over this, unless there's a lot of context missing here, tell me you either have insecurities you need to work on or have deeper issues in the relationship that need addressed."
Do not have a child with this guy unless you are dead set on being a single parent (of two).
He literally pushes you out of the driver's seat? I think you are so normalized to his controlling behaviour that you don't really notice it. What happens if you insist? What happens if you refuse to go with him unless you're the driver? Have you ever tried pushing back?
"Nah, that’s pretty serious. You don’t want to risk your body if he’s not respecting it. That’s a lot to give to another person, and you deserve the respect."
this level of betrayal is next level tbh.
"My daughter and I actually had a heart-to-heart a few weeks ago when she came over. We enjoy drinking wine together and I wanted to talk to her about how her novel was progressing. I love seeing her face light up when she talks about it, but then she asked about my sister. She was worried she had hurt her feelings by not including her in writing her novel. My daughter thinks my sister is more successful as a self-published author than what she really is. My daughter was very concerned that she had stomped over and taken attention off of her with the family. I told her that was not true and we can be proud of both of them, but also told her she was a talented young lady and shouldn't allow her aunt to think or feel a certain way. We could probably stand to go more into depth about the seriousness of the situation, but I was glad I was able to mention something to her and help build a resistance to my sister's tantrum.

And thanks very much. My children are wonderful humans. My son is extremely successful, they both take care of themselves, and each other. I couldn't be a prouder mom."
"Is there a pattern of your parents consistently favoring your brother in some way? Because in that case there probably isn’t much you can do except adjusting your expectations. If your parents are kind of traditional it could even be connected to your gender (daughter getting a job isn’t so exciting because she’s going to quit and have babies later anyway). But it can never hurt to ask. Next time you’re over there, you might say: “hey mom and dad, last week I told you about my new job. But I felt your reactions were kind of lukewarm while you know I’m really excited about this opportunity. I wonder why? Is there something I don’t know?” And then see what happens. Maybe they had envisioned something different for you, or they’ve heard bad things about this company, or they just had some bad news that has nothing to do with your new job. But you don’t know until you ask."
"You’re not being unfair.. I would be LIVID if my boyfriend did that. He doesn’t respect you and he clearly doesn’t care enough about you and your feelings. You can do a lot better, girl."
My boyfriend of almost six years just did this yesterday...while I was on vacation. He is 39.
She doesn't necessarily want your boyfriend. She just wants the attention cause she doesn't understand why he picked you over her. She doesn't want him. She wants what she can't have.
"Honestly she needs to get out of this relationship for their kids. Their 5 year old is crying and pleading because he’s in fear of her dying. Shit like this is going to stay with them for the rest of their lives. 

Take your kids and go."
"She just wants to buy him the right sized pants? I don’t see how that’s overly manipulative. She talked a lot of how great her husband is in her post, it doesn’t seem like she’s trying to do anything bad."
This is abuse. You are being abused. You need to get out of there. She's crying when you say no to sex after a car accident? She's a narcissistic abuser. There's no coping with this.
"I think you need to phrase it like this. ""You are my husband, not my boss, father, or keeper. I don't need to ask you for permission. You are being controlling. If you continue to insist that I ask you permission, I will reconsider this relationship entirely.""

Has there been some kind of significant event before this change in your dynamic? Does he display controlling behaviour in other ways?"
"That is such a ""feel bad for me"" excuse that you're making to get out of having to work for this. My daughter's father facetimes with her every single morning while she eats breakfast before school. They pick out what she'll eat together, discuss that day's plans.... And we're still married. He just leaves for work before she wakes up. He's the one who picks her up after school. We've been doing this since she was big enough to hold the cell phone. You can be an every single day dad. If you wanted to, that is."
They will always be the cool aunt and uncle. Their hands are just a little full right now. So tell your bro to relax.
"&gt;Sometimes abusers show their true selves after they’ve started to “lock down” the relationship.

u/AlmaReville said this below, and I wanted to up your chances of seeing it, and offer a personal anecdote.

I have a friend who's (now husband) didn't start getting abusive until they were engaged. All of a sudden, he had new expectations of her, and new rules, and whenever she ""misstepped"" he'd blow up and call her worthless,  a disappointment, she's lucky he loves her, etc.

I see a lot of that in your post. When someone gets abusive and kicks you out, leave. Take them at their word, and get out. If they truly ""didn't mean it"", they'll go to therapy and get the help needed to never blow up like that again."
"You’re totally right. I also haven’t seen anyone point out that OP is upset that the *same person* hasn’t invited him to events and is projecting that into his other friends.

It sucks to be left out, it sucks to see everyone else having a good time. But honestly, OP needs to learn a few things:

- Not everyone is going to like you - it sounds like he has one person in his friend group that doesn’t like him and is excluding him from events. Honestly, it sucks for OP but it’s also okay for that ‘friend’ to do that if they simply do t wanna be around OP.

- **You and your friends are not a package deal**. Genuinely think this is the most important thing OP needs to learn as an adult. As I said, it absolutely stings to learn everyone else has been invited to something and you haven’t. That being said, don’t take it out on your other friends. They haven’t spoken to you for a week? Welcome to adulthood, where you’re all super busy and probably touch base once a month. That doesn’t mean they’re excluding you or don’t like you. I honestly think the only one excluding OP is the ‘friend’ who’s done it before, and as stated above that’s okay. They are allowed to not like someone and not invite them to their events regardless of who else is invited. It’s not their place to then invite OP to someone else’s event. So I would advise OP to really think about whether his other friends are actually jerks, or whether this one ‘friend’ who’s excluding him is tainting his view of others.

Therapy would definitely help him unpick these feelings and figure out whether all his friends really are exclusionary and not worth it, or whether there’s actually just one individual in the group who doesn’t like OP and he has to come to terms with that whilst not getting rid of his other friendships."
As a latino Male I know what you're going thru. Latino parents of that era are incredibly hard on kids. My best bet is to move out asap.
"Fuck.  This was painful to read, but so eye-opening.  Thanks so much,"
"I was in a somewhat similar situation not too long ago, my childhood best friend and I were bullied pretty bad by one girl in particular. Nothing ever physical but lots of emotional jabs that still effect me to this day. About three years ago The Bully reaches out to my friend (we weren’t that close anymore but kept in contact) and apologized for what she had done. My friend accepted and they have since reconnected and get a lot great. 

I cannot stress this enough: it really fucked with my head. Part of the bullying was the girl pretended to be our friend but would make fun of us with all the other girls anytime teachers/parents weren’t around. Seeing her being friends with my friend scared me and made me feel like I was a 6 year old again. I talked to my therapist who basically reaffirmed that while yes it happened a long time ago it happened at a point when you are developing your social skills and really how to connect with others outside of your family. When someone bully’s you it is traumatic because it’s abuse, and you weren’t old enough to understand how to stop them. For me my therapist suggested just telling my friend not to talk to me about The Bully.  And I planned something for if she ever reached out and apologized.

Basically went like this: “I’m glad they you have grown as a person and know what you did as a kid was wrong. I will not forgive you though. I still suffer the consequences to your actions, I’m still nervous when friends are laughing and I don’t know why, I’m still anxious around new friends because of your actions. I hope that you will continue to grow and if you have kids teach them that bullying has lasting effects so they won’t do it but I don’t owe you forgiveness and you’re not getting it. 

I never ended up sending it but it helped me explain to my friend why I didn’t want The Bully to be talked about. Maybe write something similar and share it with your friend. Good luck, and I’m sorry you are dealing with this."
"DON'T QUIT YOUR JOB! As much as you hate it, you need it so bad right now.  Do not have kids! Do not move in!  If you get pregnant or quit you job, leaving this situation will be even harder!  Stay safe!"
"&gt; The guy can't even take the 3 minutes of his busy day to read a reddit post

Hell, a bunch of strangers don't have this problem. I'm at work right now. Her bf sucks."
"I think you handled it the right way.  She expressed an interest in something.  You told her that you understood but it was not what you signed up for.  You stated that if she feels the need to explore that side of herself, it's something she'll need to do without you.  If you didn't already, you also need to make it clear that just like an open marriage is a deal breaker, cheating will be too.  Ask her to have the respect and courtesy to simply end the marriage rather than hurting you even more by cheating and forcing you to find out later. 

Ultimately, it's on her now to decide what's more important to her and whether or not its worth the cost of your marriage.  The unfortunate news it that since this clearly seems to be pretty important to her, you're going to have be watching for the red flags you see all over this sub: ""working"" later, hiding phone screen, never putting the phone down, changing phone and social media passwords, etc.

I think you're right that she's naive about the possibility of developing feelings for the person since her own stated criteria is both physical attraction and chemistry.

Finally, based on her comment about eventually opening the marriage, she would probably be okay with you asking to sleep with other women....or at least she thinks she'd be okay with it."
This is a guy with physical abuse on the brain. I gotta wonder just what he’s imagining when he “jokingly” tells you that you’re not allowed to leave the house without his blessing.
"I’m the daughter (21F) of a physician, and my parents relationship sounds exactly like what you’re describing. Got married out of undergrad and mom worked at a bank until dad finished residency. She moved all over the country for him- away from her family where she wanted to be. They’re still married but haven’t been happy for extended lengths of time for as long as I can remember- they’ve started trying recently. It’s definitely the  “physician” mindset in my dad that makes him feel entitled and above the rest. It’s HARD to have a dad and husband like that.. very hard. Demeaning to my mom and incredibly hard on my siblings and I. I can’t put words in my moms mouth, but I can’t imagine she would go back and do it all over again. This may not relate to your situation at all and I’m not trying to make you think this is how things are going to end up but it just resonated with me as soon as I read it.. my parents.."
"Why are you with someone that makes you feel insecure and cheats on you?

&gt; Is anything I can do now to fix the situation.

Yes, dump him. Eventually you will find someone that doesn't make you feel insecure or cheat on you."
"He definitely minimizes by saying things like, ""You're acting like I've been beating you, you're acting like I'm such a batterer, etc."" I think I'll try that in the future."
"""Hey dude, at this point I'm going to give you a week to figure out somewhere else to go. At this point my wife and I need our space back."""
"Yeah, no. 6 months is nothing. Especially since you have a kid. Maybe start doing group family things at 6 months so she can start building a relationship with your son. I think 1 to 1.5 years is a good point to join houses if all is still going well. If you didn't have your son to consider it wouldn't be the end of the world to throw caution to the wind. But your son has lost his mother, the last thing he needs is unnecessary changes and turmoil which could easily occur if you rush into cohabitation with your new GF"
"So he works, picks up the kid, looks after him until you're done, then cooks and cleans. A newborn typically goes to bed by 7 if not earlier, so he is in charge of making sure he is fed and bathed while you work on lesson plans. Then by 7 he still needs to cook dinner and clean, and had to sell off his dream car. I can see why he is pissed off. I think he would be less pissed at selling his car if you were more hands on, the whole 'married to the job' comment is very telling. My suggestion is you spend less time on lesson plans, or spend more time helping with the duties."
"Just be super diligent with you birth control. My friend and her boyfriend had one last goodbye encounter before their amicable split, and she ended up pregnant!"
"What the fuck? He calls you slurs he expects you not to know in a language you don't understand, then apologizes and gets upset when you understand that he's calling you a whore?????

And you're questioning whether this is ok????????? Wtf are the standards for marriage"
"He isn’t suicidal, he is manipulative. Leave the house, call the police if you’re concerned about his welfare and stay away from this toxic piece of shit."
"This. My alarm bells are going off.

Especially that bit about her brother always hanging out with people younger than himself in his late 20's.

Like it's normally to have one or two friends who are younger than yourself, you can meet them through work, hobbies etc.

But most/all of his friends are younger? That's not normal."
"Honestly she said she's done all the work in this relationship. It honestly sounds like he was into her just enough to go out with her and was ok enough to keep the status quo. But it sounds like she was always more into him than he was into her, and he knows he does not want to marry her but doesn't want to break it off for some reason.

That's fine, but the shitty thing to do was string her along for so long. 

She needs to break it off, take some time and find someone who really reciprocates her feelings."
"&gt;I don’t work and don’t have any money. 

It's time to remedy that.

&gt;I have no idea what I’d like to do for a career, because I’ve never been told that I could have one. 

The world is your oyster. You can do anything that you put your mind to.

One idea for work is working at a daycare or as a sitter, at least to start. It doesn't sound like your parents are trying to push you into a marriage, but there's nothing more Christianly Wholesome than a young lady who loves being around small children. Even if that type of work isn't something you want to do, if it's what your parents will agree to, and it puts some money in your pocket, then that's what you should consider doing.

There are also some charities that help people breaking out of cult-like religious situations. I think your situation qualifies as that type of situation. Hopefully, other people who have been through what you've been through can point you to those resources. Reddit has r/ex(insert religion/cult/sect) communities you should look into. You aren't alone."
"Neither of you are being unreasonable,  but this is now the end. 

It's like kids. You can't compromise and have half of one."
"The problem is that you're setting this up to be indefinite. That's just not practical. Unless you're willing to play the ""few more months"" game for the rest of your life, you need to set a deadline at some point."
"Treat her as the expert on the cat. You know the cat is leaving a beloved person - how does the cat like to be pet? Where does it sleep? What are the favorite treats? 

I think your expertise can help too to reassure the cat will be safe, but be careful - you don’t want her to feel like this is just one of a million pets you’ve had. This is her special friend. 

One thing you could do - if you’re comfortable - is agree to send pictures on a schedule (to her parents). Seeing her cat thrive might help."
"&gt; He does not seem to grasp that I am absolutely devastated by that amount of money (that we DON'T HAVE - it was financed) has been spent behind my back.

Your husband's the one who regularly lies to you, doesn't consult you in major financial decisions, and has absolutely no regard for your feelings or empathy for his partner in life.

So why are *you* the one bending over backwards to try to fix things? Why are you the one coming to Reddit for advice? Why are you the one apologising for him and trying to find ways to 'move on' from it?

Has your husband made your feelings and the future of marriage his his absolute, number one priority? Is he reaching out to strangers on the Internet for advice? Is he kept awake at night, wracked with worry that his wife is hurt and resentful, and that her trust in him is shattered? Is he making fundamental changes to his approach to marriage? Is he being introspective and proactively making changes in his life, without your prompting? 

Oh, wait...

&gt; he’s been talking about adding more to it in the last few weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

Why is the onus on you to fix this, to change, to come up with a strategy to move forward?"
"I don't know the details of your miscarriage, but almost all early miscarriages are not the result of any action by the mother but of genetic abnormality.  Have you explained to your husband that nothing YOU DID caused the miscarriage? I would send him some articles on that.  I also think you should tell him to stop playing the victim.  You understand he is concerned but you need to be able to participate in the doctor approved activities that make you happy."
"I’m a stranger and this made me angry and it is very stomach churning.

I have a one year old daughter myself and I can’t see myself sleeping with my daughter’s friend 20 years later.

This is not normal behavior and it is very perverted and predatory. It is one thing to go sleep with a 40 year old woman, a peer. It is another to do something like this.

You also have a serious issue where he may have groomed her into this when she was a minor.

This is a severe can of worms and I don’t think you can live with this person anymore. There is no coming back. No therapy can solve this.

I mean it’s your child’s peer, like someone you saw when she was little. Makes me cringe 😳"
"&gt;but he figured he would put enough distance between them and if anything ever came up, make it clear that he was with me. 

He needs to do that *long* before anything ""comes up.""  She might even think that because he's not said anything to her, that he likes her flirting and that he wants her to keep being so affectionate with him. 

A conversation with her is needed, and need soon, especially because it's making you uncomfortable."
"So your boyfriend thinks sexual harassment isn't a big deal, and that it's PETTY to stand up and call people out for it? Frankly that would be a dealbreaker for me. I just can't get over the fact that he thinks you're petty for calling out BLATANT SEXISM directed at YOU at WORK. Ugh what a trash man."
"""I can't control what other people do and it is unfair for you to take out your insecurities on me. If our relationship is going to survive, I need YOU TO learn how to manage your insecurities and trust me.""

Fify."
"I'm a DV advocate. Your ""ex"" is stalking you. In most places, if you were to bring copies of his texts and records showing how often he calls and contacts you, a judge would grant you a Protection From Stalking order. If you need support with this process, contact your local DV shelter agency and someone like me can help you out."
"You can't fight jealousy with reassurance. You have to shut down her access to your accounts (not your finances) because every time she checks and gets reassured that you're not cheating, that little rush of relief becomes like a drug that she needs more and more of."
"I am just an internet stranger, so I apologize if my reading of the situation isn't correct, but here is my interpretation: I suspect you are not very good at masking your bitterness and the people around you can sense it. It hardly seems like a shock that new wife isnt auper thrilled about the obviously bitter ex husband. Combine that with your admitted self-medication with alcohol and the picture your story paints is really unflattering. Sorry if that comes across as harsh. 

Right now, your ex and the kids are happy and I can tell that makes you feel isolated and shitty. BUT, the nice thing about happiness is that it isn't a finite resource. Her having happiness doesn't mean there is less for you. Your ex's wife loving your kids doesn't mean they are too full to have room for you. You seem to intellectually understand you are being envious. As hard as it is to accept, wallowing is so tempting because it is easy. It literally necessitates doing nothing and just feel sorry for yourself. 

Yes, your former marriage is over and, yeah, your actions led to it from the sound of it. But what I didn't read is you LEARNING for your past mistakes, becoming a more thoughtful and active player in your life, and, honestly, getting your mental and emotional shit together. 

Right now, you are at a crossroads. One path is easy: keep feeling sorry for yourself, fall into alcoholism, keep staring wistfully at the life your ex wife has clearly put real work into building, keep throwing shade at the new wife for being young, and eventually  antagonize your children as they grow older. My own wife's dad was this kind of bitter old man and it was like a self-fulfilling prophecy, seeing how he wound up pushing people away all the whole moaning about how people hated him. 

The second path is a hell of a lot more work: take your ex wife's lead and build new. Go to the gym when you feel like drinking. Stop being you become an alcoholic. Work on developing a better work-life balance. For God's sake, go to therapy. Find a new lover and treat her better, having humbly learned from your past. After all, wouldn't that be the best outcome for your kids? Mom and dad both being happy, even if they couldn't be happy together. 

There might be a part of you that feels like if you move on, it will suddenly be 'really' over. Just remember, moving on doesn't mean being left behind. You moving on, establishing a second stable and loving home for your kids, will make you a better father and co-parent. 

All that being said, I will repeat that I am just an internet stranger. My advice and insight comes mostly from having seen how divorce ravaged my wife's family. The fact you bothered to post here makes me hopeful you can change things around. Hopefully, something resonated with you."
"My mom stayed connected with my dad's family after their divorce. They were still my family and she still wanted to maintain that relationship. Us kids are a grown up now and I know she still keeps in touch with some aunts and cousins just because they've been friends so long.

Has your husband ever shown any other signs of resenting your ""former family""? In the end it needs to be what is best for your son, and having a loving family that can support him together is part of that."
"As I understand it, this is not your decision.  There is a group involved.  And I think you have a fiduciary relationship to  your organization.  You cannot trash the best candidate and hire someone second rate because of the past history.  That would actually be the literal definition of a conflict of interest.

Go in tomorrow, and tell all of your colleagues taht you didn't let on today, but you have a conflict of interest with one of the candidates (don't tell them which) and recuse yourself.  Let the rest of the team decide.  This is really the ethically correct way anyway.  You \*do\* have a COI, or at least a potential COI.  Better you bow out.,"
Can you get a storage locker and make some plans to couch surf for a month and a half? Or even stay in some low cost motels.
"And some people buy it too, that's how they get stuck with those doctors. My girlfriend's mother is married to a good doctor who is a bad husband and father. Her response to anyone calling his behavior out is, ""oh but he's a good doctor,"" as if that excuses anything."
"Sounds like your dad is aggressivly targeted and manipulated by this sister (probably through guilt) alot,  maybe his whole life.  He saw that the kids are being raised in a fucked up family and wanted to help.  I don't think he did it in a good way (could have only half paid to endure they work or try, ,  definitely tell ur mom for sure). It's a messed up situation for sure,  and I'm sure it's got him messed up too. He needs to cut contact with this sister or something,  she seems toxic."
"At our house we call this **""Super Busy Minutes""** and make a riot of it. Especially when you have kids, this is necessary to provide an element of excitement and fun.

We take turns picking music to play really loud (two or three songs, no more), and everyone runs around frantically being ""super busy"" for about ten minutes. Sometimes five, if it's an especially difficult day. No chores are ""assigned,"" though if a child asks for a suggestion you can provide one. The whole idea is people seeing what needs to be done on their own, as much as possible, and then *rushing* to get it done. 

You'd be amazed how effective this can be. *So much* can get done in those few hurried minutes, it can make a world of difference. We find that when we are very consistent with them every single day, the house can get so clean even we adults are hunting for jobs to do."
You need to think about the very real possibility that he could maim or kill your baby. He killed a kitten. He stabbed his grandmother in the back. Your baby is as defenseless as that poor kitten was.
"Seriously, I didn’t feel that strongly about your situation until that last paragraph. It says everything about your relationship. I think it’s time to stop building a relationship alone."
"Sounds really insecure and is using that as validation or pointing it out to you as you then knowing or thinking people are looking at her creates a certain image of her in your mind or at least that's what she is hoping for. Sounds like she has self esteem issues but really I'd call her out on it and be like, ""what did you expect?"" or something. I think if you are her friend you should be honest with her rather than just ghost her. If she is annoying you tell her that. She probably keeps doing it because other friends haven't called her out on it before."
And - with no family or old friends raising kids “at home” will isolate the OP more - which sounds like his plan.  Raising kids at home is hard and lonely and I don’t expect him to help - only judge and critique.  I would not have kids with him if this is how he’s behaving now.
I'm surprised you even talk to them.  I wouldn't.  You have no obligation to them and they haven't shown any remorse for anything.  Keeping up a relationship with them must be painful.  My dogs are my life and I would find it near impossible to forgive somebody for killing them.  You don't have to talk to these toxic people.
"Yeah OP’s husband is selfish/entitled, he’s just using his MD as justification to steamroll OP to get what he wants. My husband is a physician and he has said multiple times he will support me in whatever I want to do, as long as I’m happy. Marriage should be a partnership of equals regardless of occupation."
"So about 2 months into dating my boyfriend, my best friend said she found his profile on a dating app, other than the one we met on. She sent me screenshots. I stayed calm and called my boyfriend.

He was very upfront and earnest about the fact the he completely forgot that he had a profile on that site. It turns out he had accounts on lots of sites because he was trying to play the odds and meet someone. He figured the more accounts he had, the better his chances were and this was an account he forgot to deactivate. He went and shut it down and we have had no issues since.

I am thankful my friend told me because this gave my boyfriend and I chance to discuss things like profiles and exclusivity and how we plan on moving forward. I am also thankful she told me because it would have been very hard on her to keep it to herself.

This could be very innocent or he could be cheating on her. Either way, it is best to tell your room mate."
"""I can't change"" is bullshit. It is also irrelevant.

You can't go on living like this, nor can you subject a baby to this.

It is come-to-jesus time (i.e. ultimatum time). He either gets a handle on his anger, no excuses, or you will leave him.

Between now and then...

Are you in a single consent state? If so, get a pocket recorder and record all interactions with him. Get those outbursts recorded as evidence.

The next time he makes you feel unsafe, call the cops. Do not pity him. He brought this on to himself. When it comes to custody, you will be glad you have the record.

Your goal is going to have to be what is best for your child. What is best is to have both mother and father in his/her life, however, only if they are healthy. With anger issues, you can't let your husband be around the kid unsupervised. End of story. So for now, unless he gets help and can prove its effectiveness, you are going to shoot for primary custody and supervised visits with the father."
"If you do break up with her, please be careful. This sounds like the kind of person whose love has a very dark underside if you leave them."
"&gt; I love my wife. The thought of being without her now makes me feel like I'm standing on the edge of a cliff with the wind pushing hard at my back. If something happened to her I'd have to learn how to breathe all over again. She's in me so deep I'm not sure how my heart would even beat without her. She makes me so happy I don't have words for it.

I'm actually tearing up at this. What a beautiful way to describe how you feel for her."
"&gt;With our niece my Dad has stated to me in private that he has seen him being very affectionate with her, putting her on his lap, hugging her for prolonged periods of time, etc. While he had done a few of these things, we wrote it off as him being weird and himself as he always has done strange things like that with the rest of the family.

You need to take this way way WAY more seriously. 

Those are grooming behaviors. It's likely that your brother won't sexually touch your niece as long as she's under-age -- there are predators who do stuff like this (flirting, kissing, pulling young teens onto their laps) and wait for their targets to reach the age of sexual consent (16 or 18) to make their move. 

Then it's not illegal! It is, however, incredibly creepy."
"This is a difficult situation. However, you simply can't take him in with a defenseless infant in the house. I'd be reticent to have him near the baby at all. Instead, there needs to be some serious research into what is available to take care of someone with his problems (social services, residential care etc.)."
"Don't respond, silence response is the best for this situation."
"Being excluded sucks, sorry.  If this was just one group you went to school with then I’d wonder what their issue with you is, but you’ve also fallen out with old friends and haven’t been able to make new friends so I’m thinking you need to do a little self reflection. Also you’re reference to the food chain is, well, kind of off putting. Do you rank things a lot like that? Maybe working on your communication and interpersonal skills will help some, but in the meantime, avoid social media if it’s too hard. Good luck"
"Wow. I usually don’t comment on relationship posts, but damn. I can’t imagine what it would feel like to hear that from your HUSBAND OF 11 YEARS. 

You are strong and capable! Go you! Best of luck in your future! ❤️"
"My mom was crazy about showers too. When I was 19 I talked with an engineer I worked with and we calculated the cost of a 10 minute shower. As you'd expect, even with very hot water, an old, inefficient water heater, etc. showers are not very expensive at all. I went to my mom and showed her our calculations and tried to point out that I wasn't really wasting much money taking an extra 3 or 4 minutes in the shower. She reacted extremely negatively, flipped out because I questioned her, and started yelling about how I can waste all the money I want when I pay for water. I offered to pay for my showers based on my calculations of how much they cost and that made it even worse. Like you suggested, she didn't care about the money, she was upset that I was 19 and trying to live my own life without her control."
"This. 100 times this.

If he's holding it against you that you're the one stopping him from ""enjoying himself"" with other girls, then he's trash. If he claims he has to **exert self control** not to cheat on you, then he's trash. He's testing the waters to see your reaction so that, when he does cheat on you, he'll know if he can get away with it or not. If you go back to him now and tearfully beg him to stay, that'll signal to him that he can probably get away with cheating on you and you'll stick around."
"You are a woman, and men will find you attractive.  You are allowed to dress up, west pretty clothes, and not wear a bra-and how other people react to you living your life is not your problem.  Your boyfriend is making it his problem, and you need to tell him to deal with it, and back tf off.
This is exactly how controlling behaviour starts-“concern” that you are responsible for how others react to you, and overtly trying to control what you wear, where you go, and what you do.

He might not even know he’s doing it, but it needs to stop."
Fr fr. Delete your comment now that we know.
I love that thank you it seems like a great solution
"It doesn't sound like this relationship is going to work. He's got a kid, you don't want a kid, you're in different stages of life and you're getting an unpleasant preview of what living with him would be like.

For the time being, I'd be very firm with him. You are not going to work from home so you can babysit his kid for him. When you work from home you are *working*, not entertaining his kid. If he needs to go out, then he needs to arrange for a babysitter, because that's not you.

Where's he going in the evenings anyhow? Are you *sure* it was only his roommate who was involved with drugs?"
"He wants to sleep with someone else. Either you accept that or you don't, and he either accepts your decision or he doesn't."
"Spot on with the summary and advice. Only detail missed was

&gt; I recently moved to another city where I reconnected with and old man I used to have sex with a decade ago. Inexplicably, I decided to have sex with him again.

This old man, in OP’s own words, “used her” when she was a teenager and he was in his mid-30s. Which raises even more questions about *why* OP was still in any contact with this creep whatsoever, much less willing to actually sleep with him again.

Both of these guys sound like garbage. OP’s normally meter seems way off if she’s keeping people like this in her life; if she’s not already, I’d encourage her to explore therapy or counseling to work on that."
"&gt; They also like to tell me this family story about my BF's grandpa who lived near a reservation and chased Indians off his land with a shotgun because they were hunting deer. They think this is a funny story. My BF gets angry when I get upset about it and he genuinely believes the Indians deserved it (even though most reservations had starvation issues back then - who needed the deer more?). 

Your boyfriend gets angry when you're upset because your bf is just as much of a racist POS as his family. You know damn well these are the people who raised him. He's making these jokes too. He doesn't like you calling out his family's trashy/cringey behavior.  Don't waste your time on this dude."
That explains it all then. There’s a real disgusting anti-wife sentiment running through the military. They are brutal. Any wife who doesn’t work the call a ‘dependa’ and no understanding is given to the extra challenges the wives and families face as a result of their loved ones service. Check out r/justdependathings for an eye opener as to how the military view their wives and family’s needs.
What he did was severely disrespectful and I would bet good money they are cheating and think you are too dumb to notice any of this.
"Fortunately, the utilities are all in his name.

Time to leave, for the sake of your own health and your unborn child. Separate your finances and contact a  lawyer"
"Same here, friend.

Narcissism is a hell of a thing. Those people really believe they are gods amongst men. When I caught my ex cheating, he left me for the other woman. When that started to sour for him, he called me and wanted to come back. He was still living with the other woman, and actually called me from her house. He said their relationship was failing because they fought about me...

I told him to even consider reconciliation, he would need to break up with her and get his own place for a while, we would have to go to counseling together, and both of us should go individually too. His actual response to that was, “I thought you would be happy I wanted to come back, not give me more of your bullshit. Never mind then”."
"&gt;she now needs a place to stay, new job, rides everywhere, money. 

You don't have to give a dramatic sit-down talk about distancing yourself. Instead, you could start by having firmer boundaries about helping her with this kind of stuff, by saying ""no"" to her. Don't feel the need to overly explain or justify your ""no."" Just be vague, like when she asks for a ride, ""No, I don't really have time for that."" Or for money ""That's not in my budget."" For staying with you ""That's not possible,"" or ""That just doesn't work for us."" And if she sucks up a lot of your time, put limits on that, too."
"Plot twist  : They do belong to the ex, but she just put them in his pocket when they were banging last week."
"He has a backup plan - literally, it's you. You're his backup plan. 

Ask yourself, and ask him too, what would he have done without you? It's obvious that he would've had to get a day job. That's just a fact. He would've had to find a way to support himself. But that's not a reality he's willing to acknowledge. What he's insisting is HIS RIGHT, is a woman who is willing to put her entire life on hold and throw out all her own pursuits and passions, to be his cheerleader and ATM. 

What are you worth to him beyond that? What is your happiness worth to him? Those are the real questions here."
"Yes, she has been my therapist for over a year. This was our first time seeing her together but I have an appointment with her in a couple weeks."
How long ago did they date? How long was the relationship?
"&gt;My dad has anger issues when he's stressed or when something goes wrong and he'll raise his voice A LOT and scream and shout and there's no talking to him at all.

And even though dad may not actively hit them, he's still emotionally abusive. Older bro has decided to grey rock, I think. Smart dude."
If my shitty husband gave both myself and my new born an STD because he was fucking around I would lose my mind.
"I’m sorry, but I’m afraid your brother is acting inappropriately. Your father probably knows something you don’t know. Maybe he’s found porn or knows of your brother molesting a child from long ago and doesn’t want to tell you. Don’t take your dad for granted.

My advice is to talk to your dad. Ask him if there’s more to the story. If your dad does know more, he may not want to tell you because at the time he might not have told authorities and feels guilty about it. No matter the case, no matter your dad’s age, no matter if he has early signs of dementia, listen to him."
"does anyone else have the feeling that boyfriend is so adamant about it because he doesn’t want them comparing notes or something similar? 

i admire you for not holding a grudge. it’s very mature and difficult to do sometimes, even when we know it’s the right thing to do. it sounds like it’s a group decision, so you can’t really sway an entire team to not allow the girl to join. tell your boyfriend that his past indiscretions shouldn’t hinder either your team you work with or this girls career. if you can get over it, he should be able to."
"&gt;OP's sister shot her shot, and kudos to her.

She kind of didn't really though.  She sent her first novel to one publisher, was rejected and never attempted to send anything to any publisher ever again. 

On the other hand, OP's daughter was rejected, re-worked her novel, re-submitted and was accepted.  

OP's sister might have been published, too if she had been as persistent."
"...frankly, he doesn't sound like he would be a good dad."
"&gt; Nobody gives a shit about speeches honestly at weddings.

Truth. They are usually awkward as shizz and incredibly rambling because everyone has been starved and keyed up all day and by food/speech time, the wedding has already been going on for hours and hours and hours."
Honestly report his ass to the police and move out as soon as possible. People who do that type of shit are fucked up in the head and will continue to do it. Best thing you can do is make sure they can’t do it to others.
"A note to OP, if you verify it's a more recent pair of underwear don't believe any other excuse. There is no confusion. He said how and where he found them. There is no way a newer brand if underwear from his ex could be in the house.

He answer will be telling. If he doubles down and says ""well I found them There, could they be a friends"" that is slightly hopeful. If he shifts to another whole new story... nope."
"Dude, your boyfriend is awful."
"It's not odd. You've never heard of cuckolds/hotwives? If you like the humiliation aspect, you're a cuckqueen. If you just like sharing him, he'd be your hothusband (or bf). It can be a fun fantasy to play with. 

Bringing it into reality is a whole different ballgame, and not one I'd recommend unless the kink is more important to you than the relationship."
"Yep, and if they decide to move anyway, add structure to the relationship - ""we're really busy, but it's important to me to make time to catch up - how about we have a running call every Thursday night / every other Thursday / whatever."" Then when they try to contact you outside of that, wait a day or two and text back something like ""sounds great, let's talk about it on our call next Thursday!""

Basically just set polite but firm boundaries around the amount of time and contact you want to have with them."
"So, let's get this straight...your boyfriend misled this girl years ago in order to fire up an illicit relationship with her, she apologized to you when she discovered the truth, she's a perfect candidate for the job, you don't hold any ill will towards her, yet you're actually considering denying this poor girl a job because your boyfriend thinks it will make him feel bad to have to interact with her?

Your boyfriend is being a self-centered ass hat. If she deserves the job then offer her the job. Your boyfriend's shame over his past actions should have ZERO say in this matter. The fact that you're even considering involving his feelings regarding this woman in your hiring practice speaks volumes about your current level of professionalism, too.

I'm not trying to be hostile here, but you really need to consider this if you intend to pursue a career in management. You need to be able to separate your business life from your personal life, and it would reflect extremely badly upon you if it ever came out that you rejected a perfect candidate for the company because 'your boyfriend didn't like her for reasons beyond her control'."
"I think leaving it at just a thumbs up emoji is better? I only say this because ""k"" is pretty infamous for being a response reserved for expressing annoyance/anger and a feigned,  effortful indifference—it may suggest to her that her words got to him. A simple ""👍🏽"" shows that you really just don’t give a fuck."
"*we're supposed to move later in the year for his job because at that point we will be financially comfortable and not necessarily need two incomes. And that's when he also brought up the possibility of having children since I wouldnt be working temporarily.*

That is the most terrifying thing you’ve written. Can you see where this is headed?"
Please run as far away as you can from this overgrown child.
"srsly, that edit says it all. 

This issue that is destroying you, is NOWHERE on his list of priorities. This should be a screaming wake-up call for him, but it's nothing. Nothing at all."
"OP, in about six months it sounds like you're going to be in a situation where he absolutely can control you financially and physically.  He's already trying now by making you ask permission and refusing to let you drive (all of which smacks of him attempting to make himself feel more like 'a man' it sounds like).

The thing about this is... The advice regarding therapy is that you should never go to therapy with an abuser because they will use what they learn to abuse you more.

At the same time you are very unsure if what he is doing is going to lead to more abuse or if this is some weird joke he's making.

OP, what I would suggest here is that you really, really don't get pregnant.  And that you don't quit your job.  And, on top of that, that you keep working in whatever place you two move to.  Hold off on children - make sure that you have your important documents stashed away and that you have a financial safety net set up that he doesn't know about.

And then, OP, I strongly advice you to go see a therapist and ask them if these red flags are as red and alarming as you feel.

From my perspective, OP, these are sufficient red flags for me to move out and talk to a divorce lawyer.  But I absolutely and completely would never let any person tell me that I needed to ask permission to go out or do things.  And any person I dated would know that them trying this bullshit would lead to this reaction from me.

But I get that it's hard for you, that you have a long history with this man and that you aren't sure if he realises how much his actions make you feel unsafe with him.

So - go see a therapist.  Talk to them about this.  And prepare to leave just in case you actually have to."
"Thank you, for all I know she may not even know that I exist either, and that means he would have played us both! 

I just want to everyone to be nice happy people!"
That sounds like an awful counselor.
Mrs. T pitiés the fool.
Run while you can. It only gets worse from here.
"It sounds like his mom is just burnt out, which is understandable. But there are ways to help her that don't include moving a violent kid with sociopathic tendencies into your house."
"&gt; Disclaimer: I am NOT looking for ""leave him"" advice

And yet, here we are.

This:

&gt; I asked again how much it was and at that time he said it ended up being about 38k. I was absolutely floored by this and have spent the last couple weeks being pretty upset over it, but he swears he told me the price at some point in the past and I must have forgotten.

...is gaslighting, and it's an abuse tactic.

This:

&gt; He tried to put it on providing for me

...is a *different* abuse tactic (""I did the bad thing, sure, but it was all for *you*, honey"").

So.  He's a (serial) liar; he knew how much the thing was going to cost all along, and he did the skeevy incrementalism thing in order to get you to agree to something you *never* would have agreed to, thus committing *your* financial future to being in service of his desire for new toys.  

And he's showing at least two red flags for abuse behavior on *top* of all of that.

If you want to bury your head in the sand and remain with someone who is willing to do all of that to you out of selfish frivolity, there's not much to be said other than ""Forgive him and move on with life.""  Except for maybe ""Don't be surprised the *next* time this happens, because you've just trained him that this tactic works and gets him what he wants and you'll just lie down like a doormat and let him do it."""
"This is a good option, I have also been speaking to Paul’s girlfriend who FaceTimed Paul at 9am and boyfriend wasn’t there then, so I now can ask him where he went back to last night, if he tells me went to Paul’s I can say you weren’t that at 9am and you weren’t with him at 4:30am when I FaceTimed Paul. 

Thank you so much for this, really means a lot!"
Id pull the phone bill and see if he contacted that number before and after the confrontation.
"Not normal for grad students. Fairly normal for someone that doesn't want to be in a relationship with you anymore.

Sorry you are going through this as it sounds really difficult. The bottom line, though, is that you will be able to find someone that treats you a lot better than this. Even before this incident you are describing a bad partner. It doesn't have to be like that, and now you are in a position to move on and find someone that fits you better."
"Yeah. As soon as I got to that part of the story I basically stopped reading. He's either married to her or in a long term committed relationship. In the comments she says baby mama and rockstar are best friends but only hooked up once and the kid came from that single hookup......bullshit. 

He is most certainly cheating on his SO while he's away with OP."
You could say that this was Victoria’s Secret...
"&gt; Your dad took out loans to pay for your cousins' tuitions, and didn't tell your mother.


THIS!!!

He took out freaking loans to pay for the cousins’ tuition! This is insanity! It’s not like he has a ton of cash burning a hole in his pocket - which, to be clear, wouldn’t make what he did ok or better - but the fact that he had to go into debt to pay the tuition of kids who aren’t even his??? That just makes this 10x worse. Basically, OP’s immediate family - dad, mom, siblings, OP - have all gone into unnecessary debt so that their extended family members could get a free college education. Like I said, insanity. 

Unless dad is a grade A asshole or just dumb, the only plausible explanation is that OP’s aunt is an entitled and well practiced manipulator and con artist worthy of the Just No subs. Given her email to OP, I’m guessing it’s the latter, but while that may explain her dad’s actions, it doesn’t excuse them. I don’t know where OP, her siblings, and her mom should go from here, but they have every right to be furious, and I don’t think it’s fair or reasonable for anyone to expect them to get over or move on from this level of betrayal and deception any time soon."
"Oof that edit.  

I'm not sure I could handle being with someone who not only knows all my past mistakes but actively uses them as a weapon.  If you will never change, and she will never actually forgive you, then why the heck are you two staying together?  I am not encouraging you to break up, but instead to ask her that question.  Because you're *so young* still.  Can you imagine the next 50 years of the same paranoia?  Is that something she really wants to do for the rest of her life? Live in constant fear that you're cheating on her? 

It almost feels like you're enabling the behavior.  I believe you both should go back to marriage counselling.  Hearing that she has unrealistic expectations from a third party is more likely to be successful, since she obviously doesn't trust you. 
 The alternatives are splitting up, or living in hell until one of you dies or she finally snaps out of it."
"Honestly, it shouldn’t be as common as it is. I think this sort of thing bugs a lot of people. I can be hyper sensitive to certain sounds and this is definitely one of them. I wish there was an easy fix and while using plastic or wooden cutlery at home is awesome I’m not sure how it can be helped when you go out :("
"\&gt;  I guess I'm getting tired of doing all the relationship things people do and I want the liberty to do the things that I want without caring who I may be upsetting. 

I don't think that's the real issue...I think the real issue is that she demands you do things, and you give in to avoid a fight.  It is OK for you to NOT go shopping with her.  It is OK for you to play video games or hang out with friends without her.  What is NOT ok is that you two can't seem to discuss it without a fight."
"&gt;if he just treats her like garbage that he forgot to put into the can, she'll just handle all of it herself (like she always has) AND he'll get to be the good guy because he got broken up with

Ouch, this brought back some memories. You are so right."
"I really think if you approach this instead from ""how can I help my wife feel loved more"" instead of ""she's unfair for feeling this way"" or something like that, life will work out better for you.

I would talk to her... tell her you've been worried about the cat and that you can't help that, but you can help her. What kind of affection is she looking for that maybe she feels she's not getting enough?

If you start asking her about specific things you did for the cat and not for her... you may be inclined to debate her and say ""that didn't count"" or be dismissive or something. I really think you should focus instead on what lack of attention/affection she may have been feeling the last few years, and how that can be fixed.

Side note, there was a time when my ex would often reach a hand out to me.. and then it would be over me, because he was actually reaching past me to pet the dog. It hurt a lot. But mostly it hurt because he was very sparing with affection. I got jealous *of my own dog* for a while. It wasn't about the dog at all. It was about getting excited, only to be let down consistently, and all because the real problem was I wasn't getting as much affection as I needed in the first place. Something as simple as giving her affection first, and giving the cat affection second, would probably help her."
"My amazing boyfriend is sleeping next to me right now. When we met, I spent the first several weeks knowing it wouldn't work out, because my soul wasn't screaming ""mine"" the way it historically has. A told a friend this, and she said that she prefers wading into the sea and finding one day that she is floating instead of having lightning thrown at her. I'd never experienced the former, but lo and behold the dude is sleeping next to me, and that is exactly what happened. I've never loved anyone more.

Second, I want to echo the person who said that your sparks may be maladaptive. Therapist, when i told him i didn't want to date this dude, he isn't my type, no sparks, etc, told me to do it anyway. Told me it was an assignment from him. ""how has it worked out,"" he said, ""when you dated guys you did want to date?"" and I had to admit that the answer was ""badly."" so he told me to date this guy, someone I didn't want to date (with the HUGE addendum that he wouldn't have told me to do that if I had had a reason like we don't get along or he makes me uncomfortable). So I present to you these thoughts from some of the wisest people I know.

Give it a shot. Don't overanalyze. Don't try to force it into a box. And genuinely see where it goes. Maybe you won't end up floating. But maybe you will."
"So... why do you *want* to marry a dude so irresponsible he can't even feed a cat? Even with kids out of the equation, he sounds like a poor choice for a life partner, especially as you get older and life gets much harder."
"So she is manipulating you so you can continue to be her confidence in the world?

Ie, she needs you to be there so she can finish school, she needs you to sooth her fears of being cheated on. I bet there are more ways she does it.

Manipulative people are typically manipulating others to protect a deep seated fear within themselves. Confidence is this one, perhaps self worth, but I've also seen fear of responsibility, fear of inferiority, fear of loneliness, fear of rejection, and a few others. She needs to work on that, and she won't as long as you are enabling her.

And staying is only going to destroy you."
"&gt; I was supposed to get married tomorrow but my fiancee broke up with me last week.

Yep.  An arsehole until the very end.

"I'm in med school, and there is a fairly large proportion of my colleagues who look down on anyone who isn't a physician. I know some who say they won't even date anyone who isn't a doctor because they view them as vapid.

It's shitty but medicine is built around a hierarchy (pre-med; med student year 1, 2, 3, 4, etc..; resident year n; physician; chief) and then the various medical specialties look down on each other based on who's job is harder, more life-saving, and even who is the most sleep-deprived. So it's not surprising that her husband has some superiority complex going on and basically views her work as worthless. It'll be hard to crack around that mentality IMO."
"jeez girl, please tell me you're not 28 and believing he lives with the Mother of his child platonically? this is the classic line all cheating scumbags use."

You do you, but I just can't be there for you about this one topic anymore. If/when this relationship ends, i will gladly help you pick up the pieces, but until then you are going to have to find someone else to discuss these things with."""
"Welp. He’s broken. 

OP, he deliberately burned your relationship to the ground. And when you attempted to start building a new bridge, he torched that too for good measure. He has no interest in calming down and frankly I think the only reason he hasn’t dumped you outright is because he wants to see you grovel a bit more. For whatever reason, a switch has flipped in his brain and you’re no longer the woman he loves and respects. You’re an adversary to be punished and distrusted. 

Whatever his “trust issues” are, they’ll continue to prevent him from reacting reasonably to minor snooping. Yeah, you shouldn’t have peeked - but this absolutely falls into the category of “normal human foibles.” You’ve committed no mortal sins here. However this ends (and it’s going to), you can rest knowing that it has far more to do with his own failings than with yours."

"Yeah, it sucks but it sounds like you're making good decisions.  Parents fleeing when CPS begins an investigation is not uncommon, and it's intent it clearly to thwart the investigation.  My advice is just to let CPS handle it as best they can (I guarantee there is some kind of reciprocal agreement between your state and Florida to share info on child welfare investigations), and pass along any knowledge you obtain about her whereabouts.

But don't spend any time becoming an amateur investigator or trying to stay up to date on everything or even worry too much about her or her son.  You've done your part, you raised the alarm, and now it's largely out of your hands.  You did a good thing, be satisfied with it and maintain your boundaries between things you can control and things you cannot."
"The only thing I can tell you is that you cannot change them.  They have been this way for longer than you have been alive.  They will be exactly like this until you die.  You cannot change their minds.

&amp;#x200B;

What you need to focus on is how seriously you take them, and how they affect you.  With my overbearing family, I started by taking one day a week where I just did not deal with them.  Fridays were my own, I turned off the phone, consequences be damned.  It gave me a bit of space to breathe."
You’re a grown ass human that can make her own decisions. You’re not being unreasonable. He needs to knock it off.
"I could understand if it was a shared laundry situation. I can't tell you how many times I've come back with stuff that's not mine like socks, underwear, shirts, and even a pair of lululemon leggings. The fact it's not a shared laundry and you recently got a new dresser, I'd wait til he got home and ask again. Tell him you called the ex and she said they're not hers and she has no clue what's going on. See what he says then."
It’s not your job to help him manage his relationship. If she is over all the time and not paying rent—that’s not okay. So I would consider suggesting boundaries or that he move in with her elsewhere.
You talk to your supervisor about this
"Absolutely!  This whole comment thread is incredibly accurat.  I had a fiancé like this when I was young and had just moved out on my own.

He’d smile and laugh when telling me I “wasn’t allowed” to go a certain place or wear a certain thing.

One day, I had enough of it when I told him I was going out of town with one of my girlfriends on a weekend day trip.  I apparently failed to play along with the joke about my inappropriate Hot Topic tube top and winged eyeliner, so he choked me and called me a whore.  I was so in shock and kept thinking that he is “normally so sweet and funny” that I let him drive me to the train station for the trip.  He even gave me a kiss and told me he’d really miss me.

It’s always okay to say, “This isn’t right,” and leave.  It doesn’t matter that he usually acts “normal.”  Things can escallate incredibly quickly."

Gauge his reactions. 

If he gets more and more aggressive, if he starts to drop the “joking” tone, if he ever makes vague threatening comments about how you shouldn’t “test” him or “push him too far,” you’ve got an abuser on your hands - and you need to come up with an exit plan."
"I think that you need to ask yourself--when she goes back to her preferred presentation (no makeup, jeans and tees or whatever, hair in a ponytail), are you still going to be interested? Or are you going to fall back into meh the second you see her without makeup?

"Welcome to pregnancy.  If I had a dollar for every time some ""helpful"" person interceded with one of my choices I'd probably have, well, like 23 dollars.   But that's still a lot!   When you become pregnant, society treat you like you are a child, an imbecile, selfish, or some other insulting combination.   After research and speaking to my doctor, I chose to drink one diet coke a diet while pregnant, execise (as I was overweight when I started pregnancy), eat lunch meat, etc. etc.  Every one of these things was met with someone, even strangers, politely asking me if I was sure I should be eating, drinking, doing that.  It was incredibly frustrating.  My instructions from my doctor was ""no smoking, watch your weight, and no raw meat"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, I know you didn't ask for a screed and this is slightly off-topic, but its still incredibly frustrating how I was treated when I was pregnant.  Luckily my husband was on board and we discussed a lot of my choices and he helped me research.   I don't know what I would do if he hadn't been such a good support system (pregnancy is uncomfortable, yo)."
"Except in a way, you are paying for them. You don't own a house, you don't have the vacations you could have, you aren't planning for the future in a way that's enough for you, and you're not having kids - partly because of his actions and the other part because of his loans."

So much to unpack here. Was she ever a minor when they were together? Had he groomed her? You need legal advice ASAP. And put him out immediately.

"So at best your partner cheated on you with a family member, which is egregious, and at worst he is in fact a predator. Do you really want to stay with someone where them cheating on you with your brother's wife is the *best* option? And you're not even 100% sure he didn't? I can say with absolute certainty that if someone told me my boyfriend had sexually assaulted them, I would tell them to go get their head checked because there's no way in hell he'd ever do that. If you're not just as sure about whether or not your partner is capable of forcing themselves on someone...man, I don't know what to tell you. That's bleak.

Honestly, there isn't a way to fix this. Your brother thinks he's a predator and obviously that's not going to change. If you stay with him, that's your reality going forward. Doesn't sound worth it to me for a relationship that's ""fine for the most part."""

"Paul is the real OG. I was in a similar situation once and my cheating partners best friend finally broke down from helping him hide the lies and watching me get hurt and told me everything he knew and supported me from that point forward. It was hard for him to lose a friend but ultimately he realized that cheating ex boyfriend wasnt a good person in general and that I was and had been a better friend to him throughout the time we all knew each other. Me and cheating partners best friend are still good friends to this day and he hangs out with me and my current partner a lot. Good people will always win.

ABSOLUTELY NOT. If your husband was having an issue with this, he could have expressed that to you. Cheating is never an acceptable solution to this problem. Your husband is a creepy predator (has he also known this girl since she was 2???? It's gross either way but that would just be a whole other level).

There is absolutely no coming back from this. Speak to a lawyer and start the divorce process. Absolutely do not tell your kids anything until you are in a better headspace, and please consider their well-being first and foremost regarding what you do eventually tell them. I can only speak from personal experience, but my mom had an affair and my dad made her tell me as a condition of working on their marriage. It shattered my world and I will never forgive him for that. Just my two cents, although this is a different situation in some ways.

"I know you are excusing his behavior a little and wanting to work on things, because this is the first time it has happened.  But please hear me...this will not be the last time this happens if you stay with him.

IF it had been a single, drunken mistake, he would have apologized immediately the next morning and done anything and everything he could to fix things.  Instead, he ""apologized"" but also said you deserved it.  THAT is your giant, massive warning sign. Please do not ignore it like I did with my ex.  

I ignored it with my ex.  The first time he acted this way was after 2 years together and I excused it due to his stressful work situation and just coming off a long distance portion of our relationship.  The second time it happened was 6 months later.  The third time, 3 months later.  Then, as soon as we got engaged just a few weeks later, it was EVERY WEEK, sometimes multiples times.  And the day I left him, he pinned me to a wall by my throat and said he was going to kill me.

Your boyfriend's response is NOT explained away by a cheating ex, or previous trust issues, or ""anger issues"".  Your boyfriend is displaying the hallmark signs of an abuser.  HE ASSAULTED you by throwing water on you.  Don't ignore that.  He physically assaulted you.  He went from sometimes angry words to actually assaulting you, which means he skipped a bunch of escalation steps in between.  He escalated in a HUGE way, and he's doubling down on it by ignoring you and calling you a cheater. 

You have got to break up.  He is not fit AT ALL to be someone's partner and you are in danger if you stay with him.  If you stay, he will know that he can get away with throwing things at you and calling you HORRIBLE names that you do not deserve.  He will know you will stay to be abused, and he will escalate even more, even if he is ""good"" for a while afterwards to make you stay.

Get out."

"Stepmom weighing in.

1 not sure how old your kids are but the ‘friend’ introduction is always ridiculous. If you see a future, and the kids are old enough to know what a boyfriend is, just intro him as that. 

2 you inform your ex that you’ve introduced the kids to your new partner (after you clarify the situation with the kids of course). Don’t make it bigger than it is or imply he has some sort of say in this process

You should inform your ex of new developments in your life via email or text on the first day of your custody time after you tell the kids whatever it is. This gives him time to react and process so any negative reaction is managed away from the kids. 

Whether you introduce him as a friend or not makes no difference to your ex, he knows what he is."

"These are NOT American cultural traits. Especially not using soap to wash his body in the shower? That is a serious hygiene problem. And he’s going to need to start washing his hands more when the baby comes. 

I think the real issue here is your husband not taking your concerns seriously, not trying to compromise with you, and then gaslighting you into believing the way you feel about household cleanliness and hygiene is “wrong” and is some kind of disorder. I absolutely see why pregnancy would kick your concerns into high gear. If he can’t even compromise about something small like not wearing shoes in the house, how are you going to agree about how to raise the kid?

I think an important discussion is in order. Try using “I feel” statements to let him know how this is impacting you emotionally (“I feel disrespected and undervalued when you dismiss my way of doing things as OCD without any discussion or attempts to compromise”). Refrain from shaming or blaming him - his way of doing things isn’t necessarily wrong (even though, as I said above, I think most Americans would agree his hygiene needs some work), it’s just different from yours. There are absolutely ways you could meet in the middle - can he agree to start washing his hands more frequently for the sake of baby in the future? Can you frame your concerns in a way that doesn’t make him feel blamed? Can he discuss your habits with you without suggesting you have a disorder? Can he have a pair of “just indoor” shoes or slippers that he changes to when he’s in the house?"

"They all say those sorts of things though. Literally had a guy try the same thing with me. Shes a jealous harpy who cant stand his career, used him,
 and they're basically roommates who borderline hate each other. 

Turns out his live in baby momma was a loving and supportive GF who put his alcoholic ass through grad school and had NO clue that he was scamming chicks at the gym when she was home watching their kid (and if memory serves, helping with his elderly father?)

Why would you want to waste your best years on something that is never going anywhere? When he gets caught or stops touring or finds a new side piece you'll be left with nothing but the story about how you used to be a famous persons booty call."
"He uses his physical strength to exert control over you. I'm not trying to alarm you, but do you think his behaviour has been gradually escalating? Do you feel like you have less and less autonomy in the relationship in general? Do you feel like it's generally 'his way or the highway?' Do you find yourself adjusting your behaviour so that he doesn't get upset?"

"social media stalking someone you think is cute is one thing- we've all done it for a bit, but the extent that she took it to is not normal. Downloading and saving pictures, friending mutual friends of yours and asking about you... that's a lot. I think you should ask her to attend therapy to address this, maybe even go together."
"Next time he suggests you two do something together, say that you can't because you have a date planned. That should do the trick. If he then goes off on how he paid for your food etc, that he thinks you two are dating, you can tell him you already told him you aren't romantically interested in him and that he can either knock it off and remain friends or you do not want to hang out again."
"There is something called decision fatigue. My husband loves to tell me about how Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg wear(/wore) the same thing every day. Decisions cost energy, and these big name CEOs don't want to waste energy on trivial choices. 

When one partner makes all the choices, they are getting exhausted from the decision fatigue."
"Thank you, I don’t plan to be alone with him or at least not in a private environment, and I’m staying with my mother for a little bit just in case."
Personally I think it would be best to focus on your brother. Neither of you can control her behaviour but you can support each other and control how you react to her behaviour.
"&gt;The thought of seeing her fills be with dread and anxiety


You are doing just fine. You did the right thing going no contact. You are doing the right thing by refusing to be in contact with her.


I, a total stranger on the internet whose opinion means nothing, hereby rule that you 100% can simply ignore this. Toss the letter into the garbage, and don't give her any more of your time or energy. You absolutely can just ignore this and move on with your life - no guilt, no shame."
"I don't know about this guy. Somewhat seems like he just doesn't want marriage and is chill with the status quo. But I've also seen women like OP drop guys like this only to see them marry the next gal after no time at all. Willingly. Enthusiastically. 

Ugh, I didn't see the edit. He's going to read a post about THEM on the INTERNET maybe tomorrow night or the next? He's either the cruelest, the most dopey or...really doesn't want to have this conversation."
"Replying to this in hopes that you see it, u/Resentment_ There was a great piece of advice, I can't remember if it was on Reddit, or on a podcast or somewhere else that I found it.

BUT, the broad idea, is that a marriage/romantic partnership is never always 50/50. It's usually 60/40 or sometimes 70/30, however what is 50/50 is that it usually changes - sometimes one partner needs more support than the other, but that will flip back and forth throughout your life as things happen to you both.

It sounds like when he was studying and doing residency it was more like 90/10 and now you're asking for your 60 but he's refusing to budge.

As others have said, what you are feeling is so VALID, I would be fuming too. Again, as others said, I think some counselling is needed, I don't think he sees you a fully realised person with your own wants and needs and that is hugely problematic."
"You’re correct that you don’t *technically* have a right to your dad’s money...but you *at minimum* have the right of first refusal. He *absolutely* should have offered you and your siblings money for education before he offered it to your cousins. 

The fact that he didn’t is flat baffling. Does his sister have some sort of hold over him? I’d be taking a HARD look at that relationship if I were your mother. If he’s going to prioritize her children over his own, to the point where he conceals *thousands of dollars* of spending from his own wife, I’d be very, very curious about why. That makes negative amounts of sense. Your family has every right to feel hurt and confused, and if your dad ever wants to have a close relationship with any of you again, he has a lot of explaining (and groveling) to do."
"It happened to me once; they ended up living together and being better friends than were separately. 

Sometimes it hurt and I got mad and sad. Ultimately though they're two people I like and I'm glad they're even happier. 

Was it easy to get to that conclusion? No. But feeling resentful isn't going to get you anywhere good in life. Take it as a compliment you've got good taste in people.

I'm 30-something now and have learnt that good friendships can come and go. Sometimes friendships arrive out of circumstance, and that doesn't mean those friendships are less than. Enjoy what you have when you have it; don't be afraid to go look for something new :)"
"Honestly I think you need to let him fail at this point. Unless he's directly managed by you, stop having discussions and chats, etc about his performance, attendance and so on. I'd *maybe* give him one more chance and ask him directly ""What's going on? In 30 days you've worked 3 full days and had several serious questionable decisions that have led me, your boss, and your coworkers to question your commitment to this job."" Then listen and see what's up. Don't take ""I know I know"" be like ""Apparently you don't because the job I got you, that pays you amazingly, and I vouched for you? You're. F-ing. It. Up. So what's really going on here?""  

It sounds like Sam doesn't...really want to be at work, for that company, in that role, right now. At the risk of outing myself, I'll fudge some of the facts, but I've been ""Sam"" before---not to that degree, but taking 3 hour lunches, knocking off early/coming in late, half-assing jobs and tasks, dipping out early, calling in sick, working from home. Some of it was alcohol misuse (which I'm now sober) and its aftereffects. Some of it was anger and disillusionment with the job, some of it was depression, some of it was being stretched really thin with out of work stuff and trying to get it all done, some of it was basically just...being able to ""get away with it"" and not making good choices. 

It's hard to say what's going on, but it seems like Sam's juggling some real and some perhaps ""fudged"" illnesses and events and his transition at the same time and he's dropping balls, majorly."
"There's a lot to unpack here.

First off, is your husband in therapy for any of the things that have happened to him? There is a *lot* of abuse here at the hands of his family, and if he isn't in therapy already he should be now to help dissect everything that happened at dinner. Abuse victims often feel a need to rein in their emotions to keep the peace, and your husband was trying to do just that despite his family lashing out at him and making him clearly quite terrified. Your husband is not used to people standing up for him and it is *terribly* new. He needs to adjust to that.

However.

You did step out of line a few times, through no fault of your own- there should have been clear boundaries set of what you would do in situations like the cousin arriving *before* dinner was even a thought. Rocking the boat is a good thing in toxic environments, but it definitely tolled on your husband's mental state and making a fuss drew attention to him that he very much did not want. He is pulling in and blaming himself for all of this and the discomfort of his family. Sentiments he has expressed before flew out the window when he was back in that environment and he went back into survival mode: don't make a fuss, don't draw attention to you, just look down and accept what's happening.

You should apologize for doing more than he wanted, but don't back down on his family being toxic. He knew it before. He needs time to settle back into not blaming himself for their actions."
"Also: leftovers are awesome! Especially if it's leftover food you cooked yourself and so know is good food. It's like all the pleasure the next day, but with minimal prep."
"You have to leave OP. You cannot expose a baby to this. He will escalate. He will have less of your support while you attend to a helpless baby and he will act out. He is not safe. He is not kind. 

You are with an abuser. Don’t tell him you’re leaving. Pack and go with your mom. OP? There is no detail missing from your post that changes the fact that you’re in a significantly abusive relationship. 

He knows you need to minimize stress for your health and baby. Doesn’t care. He can control this. Chooses not to. Don’t wait. Leave."
"She is THE WORST. Just a matter of time before that ugly behaviour is aimed at you.

Even before then, I'd be ashamed to call such a cruel person my partner. I'd be ashamed to call her a friend.

You did the right thing."
"You said your dad still raises his voice a lot and still shouts, right? This isn’t about childhood. This is about now. No one has to be yelled at on a regular basis—not even you. That your dad is sometimes funny does not make up for it."
"I'd suggest tomorrow morning.

Look, I will try to be kind.  But Reddit cannot help you much.  I see a post from a 24-year old where the heading is ""My parents won't let me move out.""   And I'm like, maybe it's a typo.  Maybe she's 14.  

I get that your parents have bullied you and browbeat you and that they are trying to make you feel inferior.   But how many of your 24-year old friends are living at home? Sure, some of them are.  But not because they don't believe they can make it on their own.  Look around at how many of your 24 year old friends are living on their own. Are they smarter, harder working or more talented than you?  Oh no.  They can do it, and so can you.

Your parents are right that you shouldn't move in with your bf with no money or resources, because if things break down and you have no money of your own you are dependent and powerless.  But you really need to get out right away.  So move in with him tomorrow, but take a semester off, work 50 hours a week, and live really frugally.  When you have a couple of thousand set aside and are able to take care of yourself on your own if you have to, go back to school.  But keep some money of your own set aside so you are never completely dependent on your bf.

Best wishes!"
"Yeah, he's up to no good. The condoms are self-explanatory, but his excuses for a lack of communication isn't great either. Unless he's working in the middle of no where, he'll likely have easy access to the internet wherever he goes, especially in an office environment - and if he truly liked you, he would take the effort to get in touch with you."
"Don't dudes have the same problems with clothing sizes that women do? I'm talking about inconsistent sizing not just between brands, but within brands. I have three different size pants that all fit me the same. Maybe men's clothes are different? If not, just tell him about how you can't trust size numbers anymore anyway, that it's all about how they fit, no matter what the size number says."
"&gt;This isn't worth breaking up over

Yes it is.  

Nobody here is going to give you the magic words that will make him change from a lazy slob into someone that takes even minimal responsibility for a livable home.

He obviously doesn't mind living in a garbage dump, but you do.

He's 31.  This is who he is.

He's not going to start being a responsible adult just because you really, really want him to.  He's not going to do it for you, or for himself.

He's content to live like a pig in a sty, and he's annoyed that you aren't.

If you marry this man or have a baby with him, you are *insane.*"

"No. Nope! Do not!!

He will trash your house. He will abuse you, the kids, and pets. He will steal from everyone. His mom will be too exhausted to do anything about it. 

If your fiance feels so bad for his mom that he wants to physically and financially support them then he needs to go live there, not bring them to you. I wouldn't marry him until this is settled. You don't want to end up divorcing because he's moved them in anyway, paying their bills, cosigning stuff for his mom and hurting your credit, etc!"
I need for op to post the date because I didn’t know this existed and I’m so interested!
The dog has bitten you and your children. You are in no way overreacting. You need to make your boyfriend see reason with this. I'm seriously surprised that he hasn't agreed that the dog needs to go after he bit the children in the house!
"Let's get high in the garage with a strange woman while our kids are in the backyard? Not only is this inappropriate, it's extremely trashy."
"I am not your lawyer and do not know where you are located, but in many states the couple's money is held to be held jointly (even if the accounts are separate), so that if one partner wants a divorce the money for the divorce comes out of that joint pot.

You can show up and casually mention that he can pick up his things later today. Then leave. Don't have a conversation with him there.
..well you're not wrong.
"I'm so glad I started this thread, I truly needed the perspective of strangers who aren't awestruck by how beautiful or charming or successful she is to tell me I'm not crazy because everyone in our circle of friends and even my family are taking her side and saying that I'm over-reacting big time and losing the best thing that ever happened to me. 

My mom who has always been on my side called today and said she expects me to make things okay with ""her favorite daughter"", my dad called me stupid and said I could never find anyone as kind as her, my sister said the same thing and she's sixteen! 

Even my guy fiends who never comment on such things and are expected to be on my side no matter what are saying to forget about all this and not lose her. My best friend said the other day ""maybe she felt scared, girls do crazy shit when they're scared"". And I thought about it, I really thought about hard, she was NOT scared, she was in control the whole time, she was enraged and disgusted maybe, but not scared. And afterwards she was happy and literally laughing. But she was not scared.

I've already ended it with her and I haven't answered any of her messages, and there isn't one person here who has in any way defended her actions so my worst fears about her, that she is not a good person at all, are most likely correct. I will block her on social media and give all the mutual friends up since all of them have messaged me and said they'll never see me again if I break her heart and that I don't deserve her and so on."
"He has a selfish, sexist outlook. This would have been a good discussion to have before getting married, but hindsight is 20/20...

The whole ""strangers raising our kids"" response is close minded and old fashioned, in my opinion.

If you're not ready yet, then he has to wait. And he may need to accept that you won't give up your career.  If he cant handle that, then he may not be the best partner for you ."
"If he can't get erect in bed and isn't particularly concerned about changing that, I think just saying, ""I don't think we're sexually compatible"" should be good enough."
This. OP please get him to the doctor or to a therapist. Men can absolutely get PPD or he may be depressed. Both of which could explain a decreased sex drive and issues maintaining basic hygiene standards.
"What an ass-backwards therapist for supporting this.

Anger is a normal and valid emotion. When someone betrays you, you have a right to vocalize your feelings. If he doesn't want you to be upset, he needs to make better choices to begin with, not lie afterwards. He is asking you to simply put up with any terrible decision he makes. 

He is turning this around on you. Don't let him do that."
"Sorry I haven’t got around to replying to everyone, as you can imagine my head is all over the shop. 

I have just been to town but in my city there’s hundreds of places to go for drinks, I popped into a couple of his regular pubs/bars but I did not find them. 

Paul, who he is supposed to be out with isn’t answering me either with I don’t blame him, I also highly doubt he is out with Paul as he rarely goes out two days in a row. 

My next move is to call her from someone else number in case boyfriend recognises my number come up on her phone."
"You need to work on the slow fade.   See her every now and then but just get ""busy.""  Pick up a new hobby... get into a new friend group... don't explain too much, just start becoming super busy.  Ramp it down slowly- if you see her 3 -4 times a week cut back to 2x a week and go down from there.  Don't confront her, don't do a big dramatic scene, respond and see her from time to time and keep being friendly, just gradually fade out and be busy.  It's a lot easier in the long run."
Yep. Final word to her should be “k” and nothing after.
"Given what you've told us it seems likely that someone else will inform the police of this mans presence and he will be moved on - so it's not really your problem anymore anyway. 

I once volunteered with homeless people in the UK, a few years back. On the basis of that experience I would suggest not engaging with him on your own. He is probably a perfectly nice person, but some homeless people suffer from serious mental health conditions that makes interacting with them a risk - particularly for a lone female and particularly as he knows where you live. 

What you could do is inform the street homelessness support services that are available in your area. As you say you are in a deprived city, there is likely to be at least one service or charity that does outreach with street homeless people. He'll may well be known to them already, hopefully they will send someone to come and speak to him. 

You may find that he is unwilling to engage with these services, but at least then you will have tried."
Do not break up with her. You need to make it seem like a natural separation.
it will take him a day or two to read this post? jfc
"This makes me so upset for you. As a mom: I AM SO PROUD OF YOU. Graduating high school is such a big accomplishment! Congratulations!!!! Best wishes for a bright future ahead. 

You are NOT being whiny. Your feelings are completely valid, and your mom was selfish by not showing up to your graduation. She didn’t even call to reschedule the nail appointment so she could be there. I’d be upset, too!"

"""Well congratulations on clearing the lowest possible bar of being a decent human being and partner. But that doesn't give you a free pass to be controlling in other ways.""

Granted I'd only use that when you've run out of other, more diplomatic, options. I also have no patience for the kind of nonsense your husband is trying to pull, and neither should you."
"I think OP made a typo and meant to write ""you to"" instead of ""to to"""
I interpret it differently. It sounds like they think you’re the one cheating.
Do not let him have one more fun affair night while this is what you’re dealing with. Ruin his fucking night.
"&gt; I’m thinking I may just tell him he needs to speed this process up and take it more seriously or me and the dog will go back my my house.

Great plan. Go do that."
"Not to mention, OP supported him through med school. Now that he’s finally in a position to earn that doctor money, he can start paying alimony. He’s going to find the pool of women eager for his doctor sperm a little more shallow than he thought once those payments start coming out."
"Your boyfriend thinks Tom is a scumbag so...he's going to let him ruin your relationship as well? That makes no sense. What does he think is going to happen because of you just being in the same room with this dude? You obviously don't like him either and aren't going to interact with him unless absolutely necessary, so what does your boyfriend think this will accomplish other than isolating Sally in a bad relationship?

He also doesn't get to ""let"" you do anything. He can express his boundaries but he's not your father."
And that's why he's dating a girl your age and not someone older who is not as easily manipulated because of life experience.
"He’s playing mind games with you and putting you in situations where you can’t win. He thinks he’s smarter than you are, he’s trying to control you with this behavior and these are the hallmarks of a dead relationship. You’re very young and shouldn’t waste your time with someone who treats you this poorly."
"Well, sending her to her room each night at the same time isnt gonna make her go to bed, so wont a summer bedtime yield the same results for you? But also, when I was 11 I hung out by myself all the time. It was never a big deal if my mom asked for privacy. Idk, man. Treat kids like people, they understand things like the need for privacy. 

On the other hand, if its your girlfriend just wanting to spend more time with her daughter, you need to respect that and just be happy you have two nights each week to yourselves."
Food is one of the basic things most couples enjoy with each other. What the fuck are you gonna do when you go on dates then? Eat shitty well done burgers every meal?
"In my experience the men who shout the loudest about how feminist and woke they are, are basically the lousiest feminists ever.

He’s horrible. He needs to get his shit together."
"&gt;What the hell do I do? 

You break up with her. She did something behind your back and then got mad at you when you found out. She has a pathlogical need for approval and will do things that hurt you to get it. This will probably escalate over time to actual cheating. You don't need people like her in your life."
"Good, I hope it does."
"It just all happened so slowly over the course of the last few years and started to feel like I mightve been the one overreacting, just hard to even wrap my head around."
"It's not up to you to deem what level of touch another person is comfortable with appropriate or inappropriate. For her, she has reached a place where she is no longer comfortable with that type of affection, so all you can do is respect it."
"I mean god damn, if my wife told me she's posted something for advice that was literally make-or-break our relationship, the first thing I would do is read it as soon as I possible could \_at work\_.

&amp;#x200B;

This whole thing is almost surreal in how little he shows he cares."
"she's making minimum wage 

and folks here act like she can go see a bunch of doctors and a team of therapists to help him out 

this is america. If you are poor you are fucked when it comes to healthcare. I wish people understood this, they could at least give realistic advice 

Realistically this kid will wind up in and out of the prison system because thats where poor people with mental health issue go. And google that if you don't believe me."
I'm a little surprised everyone so far has said yes. This seems unnecessary. If she's moving into your place and everything is in your name why do you need a contract? If she decided she wasn't going to pay you then you end the relationship and kick her out. Would you really use your resources pursuing the half a month of mortgage and utilities?
"&gt; if I tell him how I feel, he'll be able to find a solution or help me easily, and it makes me feel so stupid

I mean, this is just called perspective. It's always much easier to give someone else advice than to solve your own issues because you can't see your issues from the outside. This isn't him being smart than you, it's the nature of emotion-based problems.

I think working on your self-esteem is the way to go. If you rearrange your thoughts on his intellect, you can frame this as ""my boyfriend is incredibly smart and insightful and charismatic and he chose to date me, I must be some kinda awesome."" If you can't get over it then you should be on your own while you work through these feelings, because it's really unfair to him to resent him for his good qualities rather than admiring them."
"If you need to request text history, it’s time to go.  IMO, it’s WAY past time to go, honestly."
so? he's *already* making the situation awkward and uncomfortable for *her* - a person who has already previously indicated to him that she just sees him as a friend.
"s...stuff, oh boy, public school didn't prepare me for that"
"&gt;It's incredibly unattractive

This is basically all the reason any dude should need. Not having preferences, not actively wanting to do things, and not having ideas for things you can do with your partner, not wanting to take charge of the planning and execution of a date, etc... just makes you pretty unattractive."
"My ex gained weight throughout our marriage. Any sexual comments, ass smacks, hints at sex or my attraction to her were met with “I’m fat”. I began to resent that my attraction to her regardless of her weight was always met with her bad feelings about herself and that is what killed my desire. Maybe this is not the case with you, as you did say you pursued sex, but I agree with the others. You may have contributed to his disinterest by not allowing him to be attracted to you bc you were not happy with how you looked. You should go to therapy and maybe he’ll accept and be accountable for his actions, or lack there of, if you can take an open minded view of how he may have felt. If he’s shallow enough to not find you sexy if literally the only thing that has changed is your physical appearance, then maybe he’s not the man you thought he was. Good luck. PS: my now wife outweighs my ex by a fairly significant amount and she is sexy af!!"
I’ve been thinking about counseling but I honestly don’t think he’d be willing to go to one since they’re “not a real doctor” as he has remarked about therapists and probably feels they’re beneath him.
"15 years and not the first time and other suspicious stuff means she knows damn well he is cheating - but she doesn't want to leave.  If she ever wants a change in her life, she has to."
"&gt; For the first 4 months of our relationship he talked about her, what felt like, CONSTANTLY.

So there were immediate red flags early on. He showed his hand right away and you decided to just breeze right through it? Now a few years later and you're upset that he hasn't changed? You made the decision to keep this going."
"It’s not that big of a deal. For Christ’s sake, she loves him and is trying to shop for clothes for him and I think it’s pretty clear she doesn’t want to hurt his feelings. If that was her objective, why would she be asking us all what to say?"
"I have this and I’m married to a man who breathes loud, eats loud, pretty much makes every sound possible that sends me daydreaming of smothering him. 


What’s worked for us is getting him to understand this is a legit condition. Then i just tell him, “you’re breathing loud.” Or whatever. Often just acknowledging the sound helps release the tension so I’m not silently boiling over.


At home we don’t eat together.

Eta: he’s become a lot more mindful of the sounds he makes, Ive also worked on ways to let it go or work around it. I wear earplugs during movies so his popcorn munching doesn’t make me kill him."
"He is showing you, boldly and without shame, that he doesn't care.  I'd be gone before he got home.  Walk, girl.  Love yourself.  Choose yourself.  Enough is fucking enough.  Be angry.  Get out."
"You say "" I’ve communicated to death in many different ways and he won’t even touch me,"" but that (and the rest of your post) kinda sounds like you have been communicating that you want sex at the time you want it.  But have you sat him down and explained your feelings of lack of desire and rejection to him in the terms you did to us?

If not, you need to sit down with him and say these exact words to him (your words, BTW):

&gt;This is completely soul destroying. I want to feel wanted, I want [you] to find me attractive. I want to be passionate again. I want [you] to find me as sexy as I find [you]. But [you don't]. I feel like some desperate little girl begging to be found attractive.

&gt;I can’t do it. we’re best friends but we’re not lovers.  I don’t want a sexless marriage, I need to have intimacy. Am I crazy to expect sex in a marriage?  I’ve communicated to death in many different ways and [you] won’t even touch me. This is a deal breaker to me. 

If the lack of desire comes down to actually being tired and stressed, then you both need to tackle that with a game plan to focus on making room for sex.  Get the chores on a schedule that has a dedicated timeslot for the potential for sex, or schedule it, but deliberately make an effort to make room for it.  Get to bed on time, or a little early to get frisky.  Or set aside some quickie time before chores.  Frankly, the dishes will still be there afterwards.

Otherwise, I'd say you need to press him for a real answer as to why he has an aversion to it.  Is it a madonna-whore complex now that you two have a baby?  Is he not attracted to you post-birth (cruel to hear but he needs to be truthful).  All his avoidance sounds like there's something else going on with him."
"You’ve set your boundaries. Stick by them. She seems as though she’s equating bisexuality with polyamory, but bisexuality and polyamory are two wildly different things, and I think you two need to have a conversation about that, because it sounds like you’re supportive of her bisexuality within a monogamous setting, but you’re not comfortable with polyamory, and there is nothing wrong with that. You said you’re both seeking therapy—I would recommend seeking therapy from someone who specializes in LGBT issues to better navigate this.

I wish you two the best in this, it seems like a very difficult situation."
"Yeah, sometimes these things can be really ambiguous.... finding a hair tie in the car or something. A thong?!! No way. Only one answer to this."
"Lol I'd be more mad he's going to a DEALER to buy his first motorcycle. Your husband needs to spend some more time researching, and buy a cheaper starter vehicle for this hobby. 

Motorcycles are dangerous. We all know this. My husband has motorcycles and my limits are: driving after dark, particularly on the highway, using it as your commuter vehicle, and driving in the rain. He takes day trips usually about once a month. 

When we got married I made him update his disability insurance with his work, and then we got a life insurance policy. I told him if he wants to do dangerous shit he better make sure his life is worth the mortgage."
100% whoever he's hooking up with stuck them in there before he left because she knows about you. Sorry. Get a good divorce lawyer.
"I should add Op started dating her when they were kids. There is a reason we don't let kids make lifelong commitments.

Op you will be very happy you didn't marry your high school sweetheart. Most of us are."
That's what I think too if I first read this. Was he feeling guilty? Why would anyone say that? Why wasn't op invited?
"Bruh you won’t look like a clingy girlfriend if you do it right. Bring snacks or drinks! Say you wanted to be cute and bring him a home cooked lunch or whatnot. The fact that he doesn’t want you there at the same time is suspicious. My idea would be he’s worried if you’re BOTH there you’d try to be couple-y and it’ll be obvious y’all are together, and if he’s cheating..."
I just want to say that the fact you can think about her well-being at this moment shows that you're a good person. You deserve so much better than a jerk who cheats on you.
"He seems abusive to me. Abusers are often charming and will subtly or outrightly put you down in front of your friends. You do NOT deserve to be treated this way. Please look up signs of an abusive relationship, please reach out and find resources. And think of what you would say to your best friend if their spouse was talking to them this way."
"You don't have to ""make"" him work, but you can tell him that you cannot be with someone who makes such poor financial decisions or ask you for money.  He can either chose to fix the problem or you can leave.  Or you can just leave.  Money is a major factor in serious couples not working out and this seems like an issue that will persist.  It is a perfectly legitimate reason to break up with someone."
"Seconding just saying no! You can be a friend without being a doormat. She has to accept whatever level of friendship you *offer*, she's not entitled to a damn thing. Look up JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain) and why you shouldn't do it with some people. No is a complete sentence, don't give her ammunition to try and argue you around."
"All I can think—if he’s actually a fairly-big rockstar—is: how many yous are there? How many women in how many different parts of the country?

I think him saying he loves you was cruel. I can see how no-strings hooking up with a rockstar could be appealing, but if he isn’t being genuine, it’s just manipulation.

Time to bring out the ol’ Anne Boleyn and call his bluff. He loves you? Great! Make it official! Surely as a rockstar, he can give his child a decent living situation without living with his (totally not current girlfriend) baby’s mom, right? 

If he hems and haws and backtracks and backpedals, then you know his ‘I love you’ was simple manipulation. If he is open to making your relationship (p u b l i c l y) more serious, then you guys can discuss how you’ll approach that."
"It's mental work to make all those decisions. 


You're too lazy to help out with that work, even when she asks you to."
"I feel that if I'm married to you and you're yelling at me in a language you know I don't understand, how is that productive? The goal is obviously to antagonize and the insults on top of that is just a lot for me.

""And if he's calling you this stuff to your face I'd hate to think of what he's saying behind your back or to other people who speak his native language.""

Yep. That's what I was thinking."
"Would you have to wonder if a genuinely good person was genuinely good? 

Plus, I would NEVER in a million years call someone I love “pathetic”. EVER. 

You should absolutely leave this relationship."
"Yeah I go back and forth between just telling people the truth and respecting my dad. He's the one who wronged her, why is his reputation protected by something he did, more than once, and my mom is getting trashed because of it? My cousin just told me my mom is ""toxic"" and ""your poor dad"". Wtf. 

And absolutely, she's been through hell and back, she just wants peace and to have a life of her own, i'm very excited and happy for her to set up her new life and ill be there every step of the way."
"Before going to HR, go to an employment lawyer. Lay out everything you have and see what they say. Unlike HR, a lawyer will have your best interest at mine. Follow their advice as to what and when to report your supervisor.

I’m truly sorry you’re having to deal with this. Men like your supervisor truly do not belong in positions of authority and 100% deserve to lose their jobs over their actions"
"""...either shut up or get informed. ""

&amp;#x200B;

i love it."
"You are married. That means his debt is your debt. (This is not legal advice; I’m talking about the principle of the thing.)

The fact that he won’t tell you how much YOU owe on his student loans is borderline abusive. 

The fact that he won’t contribute to household chores and doesn’t share a vision of the future with you... why are you with this guy again?"
"Set ground rules, make sure they know that you have your own life that doesn’t involve them, and even though they’re moving closer to you doesn’t mean that you will be spending all, or even some of your time with them if you don’t want to.  You are in control of your time and who you spend it with. If they want to get upset, and butthurt over the fact that they moved across the country to be closer to you, but you don’t want to spend time with them, then that’s their problem.  Just be open and honest :)"
Depends on what you want. Would you have accepted her advances if she was sober? It's very unlikely she's making comments like that and trying to lead you to her room without being genuinely attracted to you to some extent at least. Telling her would open a conversation about potentially exploring this further if you wanted to. Or just forget about it if you are happy being friends and never want to talk about it again.
"Honestly, save yourself the heartache and drop him. That isn't a normal thing to say."
"No. He uses his own language so he can use abusive language without her knowing, because he knows it's unacceptable."
"It sounds like you’re in the military? If so, there are a lot of resources.  If you’re religious, the Chaplain is great, even if not, they can hook you up with marriage retreats so you can get a little break, relax, and take some marriage classes.

Family counseling is also a great option.  Some people are afraid of traditional therapy going into their medical records, but I don’t believe that’s a concern with family counseling."
"If he wants to start fixing his mistakes he needs to empty that big expense account to pay off a chunk of ""his big things"" expense. Stand firm, this was not for you, you didn't ask for it, he twisted your arm. Admitting guilt may be a first step, but fixing his mistakes is the next step. Actions speak louder than words."
"&gt; He played soccer and then baseball from elementary school through freshman year of high school and loved it. He also likes rock climbing sometimes.

So why do you *have to* do weight exercises and running/walking with him? Heck why do you have to exercise with him at all if he clearly doesn't like it? Either meet him halfway and join a climbing gym or a soccer or baseball team together, or encourage him to find something he enjoys and do it on his own."
And that’s a bullshit excuse on his part—you deserve the truth and he has an obligation to be honest with you even when it will get him “in trouble.” He’s acting like a child.
"Dude married a woman (mom #1), had a daughter (19) and son (17),  Got woman (mom#1) pregnant with twins (16,16), then got a different woman mom#2) pregnant ( third 16 yr old) around the same time as first woman (mom#1) was pregnant with twins.  Mom#1 apparently found and bailed/divorced husband and left with Daughter (19) and appears to have gone almost no contact? (unknown).  Father married/stayed with mom #2 had two more kids (15 &amp; 14), sounds like all kids other than the 19 yr old are Male.  Mom #1 died so oldest Daughter (19) now only has bio dad and a bunch of brothers she doesn't know.   Her brothers want to incorporate her into their family which she doesn't feel a apart of because she wasn't really and they are having a hard time figuring out how to help their sister who going through all kinds of life changing grief right now. 

To OP, You all need to go to family counseling to figure this out, This is a super complex issue for your sister and you all and will take years of sorting out for everyone involved."
"Like this:

""What do you want to get for food?""

I REALLY could go for some tacos right now!  Let's go to tacoville!""

You have opinions and wants and needs, right?  Express them sometime.  And even if you don't really care where you're going to eat dinner, throw out an idea.  ""How about some Vietnamese?  I heard there's a new Pho place nearby that's supposed to be really good""

Engage her in conversation!  Tell her your opinions!  Don't just be all: ""Uhhh I don't care, you figure this shit out"".."
"&gt;He's made comments like, “god I hope I never have a daughter"" and how he would ""literally be depressed"" if he had to raise a girl.

Please don't have children with this man. 

&gt;(Not to mention if we had LGBT+ kids, what he would possibly be like to them)

Wait, so along with his really amazing views on gender and fatherhood he's also a homophobe? 

Why are you planning to build a life with this guy exactly?"
"The apology thing is stupid but honestly I’m sitting here thinking about the singing.

You are in bed winding down ready to go to sleep and she playing loud songs and singing and then flicking things around for your cat on you.  Is she trying to get attention?  Is she 14?  I couldn’t handle being with someone who couldn’t chill out and leave me alone."
"&gt;  My father had mentioned a few times to our sister to ""be careful and watch her around him"" and other slightly strange things that she shrugged off 

Your father is right and you should heed his words carefully. Your sister (or perhaps BIL) should ask your niece if her UNCLE has does anything to make her feel uncomfortable. Also let her know it is normal and healthy to turn down physical contact from a relative, even an older relative, that makes her uncomfortable. Contact even as simple as a hug. Even if she has GIVEN hugs in the past and no longer wants to. Be as non-judgmental as possible and do not defend your brother's behavior.

""Best"" case scenario is your dad is wrong and your brother **still is incapable of setting healthy boundaries** but now your niece will have an easier time standing up for herself when (not if) her uncle makes her uncomfortable. 

Worst case scenario is that he has already done something inappropriate but now your niece knows her parents love and support her and are willing to go ""against"" the family to stand up for her."
"Have you thought about how all that time you plan if devoting to dog care takes away from the time you have to care for your child?  She might have been counting on you to help with your child before and after work.

Have you devoted similar amounts of time and energy in preparing for the dog as you have your unborn baby?  Are you as demonstrably enthusiastic about your baby as getting a dog?

Do you think your wife might be kind of upset you care more about your hypothetical dog than your child she is currently pregnant with?  Perhaps even heartbroken?

Couples counselling would be useful in getting you two to make your priorities clear to each other, your ideal timeline and hopefully they are similar."
"He's only changing now that he realizes you might leave. He knew you were unhappy and didn't care at all until it impacted him, and he will do the bare minimum to keep you until he feels like you'll put up with his garbage again.

Drop him and find someone who cares about you genuinely."
This is hard. Especially since you have a younger sibling. My advice is to tell your mother you aren't taking care of her anymore. And give her less than a month to get a job before you move out. But definitely move out. Also see if you can help your sibling out or bring him with you. Or at least move somewhere if he needs basic necessities he can reach you.
"&gt; he has changed dramatically and has owned up to A LOT

Except he hasn't changed and hasn't owned up to the main thing he did wrong, which is go out on dates with this girl while dating you, and then lying about it to your face?

&amp;#x200B;

This sounds like a case of ""he's done everything, except the actual 1 thing that really matters"". Often cheaters and liars use the ""flood of honesty"" technique -- they give you truth, sincerity, love, all the good stuff. And it is true. They do everything. EXCEPT of course admitting the biggest thing, and stopping their behavior. He did everything, EXCEPT admit he cheated with this girl. He did everything, EXCEPT curtail his feelings and curiosity for this other girl and leave her be. 

&amp;#x200B;

He's not telling the truth because he doesn't have to. He can give you little honest crumbs and little bits of sincerity -- he doesn't have to give you the ""steak"" because you're happy enough with the ""garnishes"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I would demand that he quit the bullshit. Either admit right now that he fucked that other girl, and start to come clean with no details left out, or you walk."
"You could look at the pics and cross reference them with what you know and social media accounts to see if any of them are from after they started dating. At the end of the day you should tell her. If he's not committed or being unfaithful and you knew, it will ruin your friendship with her."
"God, I'm sorry, but your husband is the worst kind of God-complex doctor. I wish med school admissions had weeded him out, yeesh."
"Addiction is an incredibly difficult thing to overcome, but that responsibility is entirely on your ex, not you. Only he can make the change, no matter how much you try to help him. That being said, now is a wonderful opportunity for you to begin putting yourself first. Start exploring, traveling, reading, figuring out your life goals without someone else as part of them. I would not take him back if I were you. Instead, I would use this as an opportunity to find yourself and focus on your own well-being. It may be hard at first, but it'll become easier and you'll learn many intriguing facets about yourself!"
"&gt; Blood doesn’t matter; love does.

That’s a fantastic quote. Thank you for that."
"Are you in a relationship where you don’t intend to get legally married but you are 100% committed? It seems that way if you two are planning on having a baby soon. If so, spouses absolutely have a say in who is living in their home. If he is taking the stance that you don’t have a say, then he is not treating you like a committed spouse and you definitely should not have a baby together."
"He's going to make a terrible father. I feel so bad for his future kids. He doesn't even seem like he wants to be a dad, but just wants something else to brag about having."
"ughh I used to be this guy, I think it has more to do with not wanting to effect the mood the rest of the day if it's depressing or big news. Not saying it's a valid form of communication at all but it's more of a defensive tactic for them selves."
"I third this! This is absolutely appalling, OP. How can you stay with a man like this; who treats you so poorly. Do you want your kids to grow up seeing how badly you’re treated; let’s hope they don’t catch onto their dad’s behaviour. You need to leave him. He is taking advantage of you."
"Every time he texts you about being late or sick or anything, reply ""You need to inform your boss.""

Don't pass the message along. That's not your responsibility.

He's an adult. He needs to act like one. Not your circus, not your monkey."
"Hopefully you found a good person to split all the bills with! 

Just for anyone else reading this - personally I think this kind of unspoken test can be a little misleading, as a lot of people were raised NOT to protest if someone else insisted on paying. Money stuff is weird and very family specific. Also there is absolutely a gender dynamic that makes it muddier. It's not necessarily that a person is a terrible gold digger if she doesn't tackle you on the way to the cash register, but maybe that she is thinking 'what a gracious gesture, how kind of them, I definitely will have to buy the next one'. Or maybe she is thinking, ""Geez, that dude was so serious about paying for everything. Does he have some weird ideas about paying for dinner and sex? Oh no."" Or maybe, she is just like ""thank god, I did not want to pay for half his t-bone when I just got a salad"". Or maybe they are a terrible user! Hard to say. But you could always ask before the date, 'hey, do you mind going dutch?', which allows them the ability to plan on the financial end and also to refuse if they only want free dinner."
sometimes what you hope for isn’t always the best case scenario. i’m glad you’re doing well and i’m glad that it ended up all okay.
"I would like to unpack one specific part of this response. OP said:

&gt; My husband tried to push him off and asked him to get away from him. The cousin said not until he gave him a hug and I walked in then, saying “he said to get away from him”

&gt; You should apologize for doing more than he wanted, but don't back down on his family being toxic

Your husband made the choice of trying to push back ""nicely"". Us, from the outside, we have it easy: we know that ""nicely"" doesn't cut it when it comes to abuse and that we have to rise to the challenge if we want to make it stop. Perhaps even crossing all our boundaries and fighting them for our lives. By punching the abusive asshole, you took away your husband's choice and forced him to pick yours: you ""escalated"" a situation he was hoping to defuse verbally.

I would 100% have done the same thing by the way, I was getting increasingly agitated just picturing the situation. The thought of my loved one getting assaulted physically after all that emotional torture is nerve-wracking, and I would probably not have been able to stop after one single punch.

I also understand that your husband can feel betrayed because you overrode him, and is surely confused at the thought of also being grateful because you did _the thing_ he has been dreaming of. He is also afraid of emotional/physical retribution and of losing his family forever, your choice has escalated things to a point in which both these results are very likely if he doesn't cut them off completely.

You don't need to apologize for defending him, and I don't think he wants you to do that. I do think that you have indirectly made the choice for him to ostracize him from his family, and judging by his insistence to go to a family event in which his abuser was going to be: he doesn't seem ready to send his biological family to the trash can.

If you two can't unpack these feelings constructively, please get to therapy. In time, he will feel silly that he was ever mad at you.

Have my most sincere handshake/hug for standing up for your loved one."
But does the therapist see that he is trying to justify the lying? That is still a problem if he cnanot accept that the lying is wrong.  Period.  You can't try to justify why it was right
"Whatever you do, do NOT respond. he wants you to feel this way. When you took that photo, did you comment on how silly you look? did you say something like ""oh my god i look awful! haha!""  if so, he is using this against you. He wants a reaction from you. I would ignore him. Block him completely. when you're ready to unblock him, you will see how quickly he will be crawling back. how hot you look in the picture you just posted. This is what people who feel like shit about themselves do. Do not let this get to you. Youre beautiful and you are worthy of someone much more than what he could ever be. The fact that he is 30 saying things like this, should tell you more than you need to know about him. What a loser.  I hope this helps."
