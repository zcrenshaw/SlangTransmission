"You Sir, are the parent most of us dream of having.  Your son is the luckiest boy on the face of this planet.  

Thank you on behalf of all of us who were afraid our parents would disown us, particularly our fathers, for being who we are.  You are amazing.

That being said, I know it sounds simple, but you’ve got to take it one day and situation at a time.  Your wife will hopefully calm down and realize that her relationships with you and your child are more important than the narrow view she currently is demonstrating.

Your son, if he didn’t already know, for sure knows he’s got a fucking amazing father on his side, and knowing he has that kind of support will go far.  He’ll need reassurance, and if he’s like his father will likely be reaching out to give whatever of himself he can give to support you.

So, until she sees reason, or makes her mind up on how to approach this, support each other.  Keep or try to keep an open line to mom too.  


And I’m sure many of us here will lend our support as well.  "
"Fucking annoying as shit, talking to a guy eventually trade numbers, I ask him what major he is in he says he isnt in uni.

""You arent 18 are you""

""No I'm 16 but it's okay I've done stuff with college guys so I'm not inexperienced""

Like... Motherfucker I'm a goddamn virgin that's not the problem here what the fuck"
Because straight men are way more insecure about their masculinity than gay men are 
"Gay guys have seen way more dick in real life than straight guys. So if a gay guy has an average dick, he'll know it's a perfectly average dick and not worry about it. A straight guy's only comparison is the dicks he sees in porn so he thinks his average dick is a small dick which makes him feel insecure. "
"Also, if you haven’t already, do what you can to prevent him from thinking your wife’s decisions are his fault. Children already blame themselves for fights/divorces between their parents and this line of thinking would be more harmful to his mental health. The last thing we want is for him to think you (the one parent who actually has his back) would be happier without him around.

This reminder feels almost unnecessary, though, because frankly you sound like an amazing father. "
"&gt; I realized that since I knew he was gay for awhile I should tried to slowly ease her into the idea to make this less explosive or maybe if I stayed calm earlier I could have handled it less emotionally. 

No. As much as it's not your son's fault if his mother broke into rage, it's not yours either : it's her fault, period.

I don't have so much advice, wait for people who lived it... I think you did all the right things. I'm a little worried that your son wants to spend night at a friend's house : of course it's good for him, but i wonder if he doesn't try kinda of ""obey"" his mother by doing that, like if his presence in the house was a problem."
"More so, think of the lives you'll ruin when someone gets charged with statutory rape..."
Call CPD and get the fuck out of that place. Your parents are child abusers and should be in jail. that is ***not*** normal or acceptable behavior. 
I knew a guy who did this at 17 pretending he was 18 and used it to blackmail people. Scumbag.
"It is a bit annoying when my straight friends try to push the homoerotic play envelope, like being straight cock-teases honestly isn't cool"
I am turned on by own smell... 
If it slowly gets hard in the process.... 
"Just literally wank, any adult expects a young boy to jerk off, they know already, they probably don't care and they will 100% not listen in."
"Dude, that's not a story, that was straight up abuse. Talk to a guidance counselor or someone at school. They're mandatory reporters."
Keep pretending to be straight until you’re completely independent. 
"Yeah, that was more or less my strategy with my father. I determined that my mother would be fine, but my dad's religiosity would interfere with rational thought. I kept him distant and only maintained the relationship with my mom. They both attributed it to us both being intelligent and stubborn. We would frequently disagree, but both had solid reasons to support our position (well, solid in his mind. Religion is never a justifiable reason for anything). 

Anyway, when I was finally outed by my father, I was well prepared. He could have been hit by truck in front of me, and I'd have been relieved. He reacted as badly as I had anticipated, and my mother reacted as well as I could have hoped. The atmosphere in the house devolved into a cold war so I moved in with my boyfriend (which had the intended effect of making my father further lose his shit). 

After a couple weeks of this, and without my knowledge, my sister got fed up with my father being a dumbass and dropped a nuke on my mom. She stated flat out that if my dad didn't stop plotting to pull me out of college or disown me or whatever, both she and I would never talk to *either* of our parents. We would cut off all communication. She told them that if their love is conditional towards their children, then so could their children's love be conditional towards their parents. The kids are a package deal and if one of us gets cut off, then both of us are gone and never coming back.

My dad caved the next day. Here's the crazy part, though: my sister did this would consulting me (she knew me well enough to know I'd agree to follow through on her threat) and *never actually told me what she did*. I learned about it 5 years after the fact when she casually brought it up in a conversation. I always knew my sister could be a hardass when she wanted to, but I never knew she used the nuclear option on my behalf. 

My coming out was 15 years ago and it subsequently brought the entire family closer together because my sister sparked in my father the realization that Jesus was about unconditional love, which contradicted what the church had taught him about gays, so he decided to go with Jesus's teaching which had more authority than the church. Strong call, dad. "
"I remember in 2008 the equality officer at the university I attend said there was nothing wrong with calling gay men fagots or queers because that’s what most people call them. She was a black woman in her late sixties and I asked her (this was in the middle of the Iraq war) if it was equally okay with calling middle easterners sand n*****s and she said it was the most offensive thing she ever heard. She concluded that as long as no one was spitting on the gays or physically assaulting them she was fine with the way things were. I went straight to HR and reported her and the faculty that was calling gays fagots, but I’ll never forget it."
"&gt;And I just unleash on her. I pretty much say what kind of mother is she and that I'll be 3 weeks dead and buried before I let him leave and she gets angry at me for backing her up on this and that being gay is wrong and bunch of other bullshit. Anyway, after a hell of a heated fight she leaves and goes to stay at her parents.

You did the right thing. She showed that her love for her child is conditional on her religion, whereas you showed unconditional love for your child. Congrats on being a good parent while she failed miserably. 

Your next step is to get her into counseling. She's fucked in the head and needs professional *secular* help. You probably also need couples counseling because she's going to view your siding with your son as a betrayal. 

The next time you talk to your son about this, make it crystal clear to him that his mother is wrong about this and you are 100% opposed to everything she said and did. His mother is forcing you to choose sides and you're choosing your son over her. She flipped his world upside down and he needs you to be his bedrock to re-establish normalcy. 

Look into PFLAG, as well, for resources from other parents that can help *you* get through this. You're not the only parent that's had a spouse go off the deep end because their kid is gay. You're experiencing your own trauma from your wife's behavior and PFLAG can give you the support you need. "
"A lot of minority communities are very homophobic. Change will will come with time, but it will not be easy or comfortable. "
"Of course, why not...

It doesn’t stay soft for long though. "
"Well the bible also says that [wives are property](https://www.usnews.com/news/religion/articles/2008/01/25/ten-biblical-teachings-women-love-to-hate) and must do what their husbands tell them, so tell her to read her book again and pay attention this time.

She doesn't get to pick and choose what she wants from her religion.

&gt;maybe if I stayed calm earlier I could have handled it less emotionally.

You did nothing wrong, she's 100% of the problem and it's entirely her fault."
"That's why I always bitch at my friends who take off without so much as a text, phone call, or even a fuck you before hand. My family has history with running into serial killers and having them present in the communities they lived in. Even I have lived nearby a killer before while they were active. 

People don't realise there are quite a few active serial killers across the world. Many of which have never been caught and just as many or more who haven't even been discovered yet. Be safe my dudes. Especially some of you  who don't have anyone that will notice you're gone before it's too late. "
"Ultimately, too, he's not really blaming *himself* for the wife's decisions, he's effectively blaming his *sexuality*. 

Which can have serious repercussions down the line as he's effectively equating love with evil."
"My favourite way to go about it exagerrating it: ""Boy, I sure do love me a big pair of boobs"" or ""I sure do love having sex with vaginas"""
Just be like keep playing and I'ma suck your dick.
"I'm very surprised that only 1 comment so far mentions PFLAG (Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays).  One of the primary reasons this organization exists is to assist, guide and mentor parents of gay kids who are just coming out.  There are many chapters across the US and Canada, one probably not that far from where you live.  They have once a month meetings, usually its about a group of 25 parents of gay kids.  Many of the parents are veterans whose child came out many years ago, and have lots of expererience and wisdom to share.  A handful are newbies, parents whose kid just recently came out.  Your wife needs to attend some meetings with you, and she can talk about all of her emotions, fears, dashed dreams etc with all the other parents who have been through the same thing.  I went with my mom a few times after I came out, and the meetings were wonderful.  The group was very welcoming, and it proved to be a very cathartic experience.  Your wife needs to talk about these things, and not just with you because you don't have the experience to guide her.  The other parents do.

I also recommend you buy the following 2 books off of Amazon:

1 - [The Family Heart](https://www.amazon.com/Family-Heart-Memoir-When-Came/dp/0345394089) - a very uplifting memoir written by the mom of a gay son, and how it brought their family together.

2 - [Prayers For Bobby - A Mother Coming To Terms With The Suicide Of Her Gay Son](https://www.amazon.com/Prayers-Bobby-Mothers-Coming-Suicide/dp/0062511238) - This book is the complete opposite of The Family Heart, a devastating story of the tragic death of Bobby Griffiths, whose mother had an awful religious-inspired reaction to her son coming out.  Mary Griffiths eventually came to terms with it, and became a gay rights advocate and activist.

Buy those books, read them and have your wife read them.  Rely on the support of PFLAG.  These should serve to help you through this time, and embrace your son.

www.pflag.org   Find your local chapter there.  Good luck, and thanks for being a terrific father."
I'm the same. I'm 23 and never been in a relationhip also. I also cuddle my pillow :/
"I'm into guys older than me, so this isn't something that could happen with me. But it annoys me just to think about it.

Come on, you'll have the entire life after you're 18 to use these apps, stop ruining it for other people."
"Dude..  My boyfriend smells SO good to me.  Not like his fresh out of the shower clean smell but, when we wake up in the morning he smells so arousing. Just his scent, the smell of his skin and his hair turns me on so much. In the mornings I like to nestle my face in his armpit because he just smells fucking delicious. Instant turn on."
What about getting straight porn ads when you're watching gay porn it's like internet can do you not get the hint lol 
"Jerk it in the shower or get a speaker like an Echo or a Home so you can play music to kinda drown out the noise. Then if you watch porn, listen with earbuds and only wear one of them so if anyone is trying to comment on the noise of the music, you'll still be able to hear them over the noise of whatever is going on on your screen. source: I lived through almost the same scenario for pretty much the first quarter of my 20's. Just wait til you have to share 1 room with 2 other people. That's when you gotta get real strategic. Good luck man!"
"&gt; I get an actual woopen with a leather belt ( like 30-40) hits by my dad  and they made me take off the new smart watch I saved my own money (that  I made my self) up for and smash it with a hammer. 

In this single sentence, we have child abuse, battery, and destruction of property.  Emotional abuse is a given as well."
Why would they listen to you?
But please dont just do it for him... 
Yep. Love to feel it get hard in my mouth 
They know gays are too smart to fall for penis enlargement claims...???
"Worst part is the  Toronto gay community had reported many missing members for years and asked for police to investigate, they dismissed claims and with that allowed for this killings to continue. They believed now he is involved in cases dating from many years ago. This seems to be only the tip of the iceberg "
"Gay people make up a small percentage of the population, so it's likely you'll see the same faces constantly in your area. "
You’re sexy af man don’t worry
"""there is nothing more attractive to me than the clear absence of a penis"""
This is the scum I’m referring to 
"Gays are also probably less insecure about their size, considering we know where we line up and know what it is like to receive as well.

(pro tip, the prostate isn't 9"" inside the rectum)."
I don't even have gay men hitting on me...
That's been the plan.
"Firstly, apologies for the asshole who made the first comment. 

Secondly, whoooaaa there - slow down. There is a lot of 'I blame myself for bla bla bla' going on with you guys. You're all human, and you're all doing your best. Put the blaming thing on hold till the crisis bit settles down a little. 

You don't need to be able to handle this like some kind of expert - as if this is a situation you're supposed to be practiced in. You've never done this before, so give yourself a break. 

Sounds like you were 100% supportive of your son, and that's awesome. From a gay guy's perspective, you couldn't have done any more to support him. Just keep doing that. Tell him you're proud of him and tell him you love him - that's it. If you mean it, there is no stronger support for him right now. 

You can't repair the damage in his relationship with his Mother. There's stuff they will need to work out for themselves. You don't need to handle things well in respect to your wife. Call her, speak to her, sure. Tell her how you feel. Be honest. But also - it's OK to give her a break too. Be honest, be kind, but if you have red lines (i.e. I am continuing to support my son) make them clear to her. You should never feel like you have to choose between your wife and your son. It's not fair to put you in that position. 

Support them both, but at the same time recognise you need support also. Make sure you have someone to talk to about this - a close family member like a trusted sibling, or a close friend. Make sure you have the support you need also. 

It's early days - wait and see how things are going to go and stay strong. Sending best wishes to you and your family. "
hey I started going on these apps when I was 15 and.... oh yeah I see your point. 
"You should elaborate on your family ""running"" into serial killers."
"""Feel free to rape me when you get the chance"" uhhhh...."
I’ve went on a date with a guy and lend him a coat. THAT FUCKING COAT I CANT STOP SNUGGLING THAT SHIT FOR DAYS
HR looked into it and agreed that it was highly inappropriate and gave them a verbal warning. If this were today you could record it and send it to CNN and it would have a way different outcome. I was treated awful for going to HR. Times have changed.
"What are you talking about?

He breathed next to me. BREATHED!

That is surely a sign. "
"I guess my sub class is probably the geek top i have lots of tech points and use them to my ability to control the sexual atmosphere.

Hey Google, dim and set the lights to pink and play some smooth jazz and r&amp;b ;)"
That we're not much of a community at all and the amount of pettiness I've witnessed throughout it only makes me feel more isolated.
Not sure. If he goes to a Christian school it might be best to avoid their shitty advice. Religious people aren't to be trusted
"I agree. The wanting to spend the night over a friends house raised a red flag to me because in this vulnerable state your son may do some things that would be hurtful to himself especially since he keeps insisting that things are his fault. Keep reassuring him it’s not his fault and that he is who he is and you love him for that. Being yourself is never something to be ashamed of and that’s the hardest part of being gay. The shame. Which unfortunately your wife has pushed him into thinking is the problem. 

There’s nothing you did wrong in terms of “preparing your wife” for it. Because it may have just alienated her and made your son wait even longer to come out ?"
"Gays with small dicks can bottom, so there is less of a market."
"In a 4 year relationship, still lonely.

Alas my dudes, relationships don't always mean you feel complete. "
I feel like if you hit a 15 year old with a belt it’s assault. It doesn’t matter if they are you kid or not. Just remember that.
"Are you serious or fishing?

Your a 21 yo, blonde white twunk, who is very attractive. This pic wouldn’t last 2 minutes in Grinder or Adam4Adam. Youre not late all. "
So basically straight guys need to watch more gay porn
"Hook up apps and hook up culture are perpetuating the stereotype that we’re all slutty. 

But it seems less like a stereotype and more of a fact. "
"Do it louder and louder until they confront you, and then stare them right in the fucking eyes and just keep going. You're a man. Own your space."
lots of gay men are racists (some even won't consider men of other races as friends )
"I’m not certain I prefer it necessarily, but I love cuddling, both before and after. And I’m more than fine if I’m with someone and we end up cuddling and never get to sex, It can depend on my mood, but I’m into a lot of body contact and kissing, and if that’s as far as it goes I’m happy."
"I’ve never been with an FTM but I’ve definitely seen some that I find attractive. If I find a guy hot I don’t care if they have a small penis, big penis or no penis. 

Although this is coming from someone who is mostly a top. I can understand how such a relationship might not work for a bottom. "
"It's almost certainly him remembering what it felt like to be your age, and probably having a laugh at how uncomfortable he could make you by sticking around for a conversation 😂😂"
Yeah it can be really fucked up when you have a guy going through a divorce with his wife who you're extremely close with start doing stuff like that or talking about moving in together and even talking about marrying you. Fuckin guy really twisted my head up for awhile until I snapped out of it.
"I do. It's a fun joke. Besides, straight people pretend to be gay so I feel it's fair."
"I'm not against teenagers having sex with eachother, and think 18 is arbitrary age, lie I mean a 17-19 year old really isn't a crime.

Anyway. 

I do think that grindr is a bit too toxic for a young mind though. "
"I rejected my dad. I grew up in a rural area, and my dad was traditionally masculine and would often try to pass those values on to my and my twin brother. 

He made us play every sport, even though I often did not want to. He would teach us how to chop wood and plant in the garden and to change a tire on his truck. When I would complain or resist any of that he would always explain: ""you need to learn this stuff for when you get married and have kids of your own.""

He would point out girls in my classes that were my friends and would always ask me about them - who I had a crush on, etc. So because I knew I was gay from a very early age I began to harbor a lot of resentment towards him for trying to force me into his stereotypical definition of what a man was.

So I began to pull away from him. My dad is deaf and communicates totally with all of our family in ASL. When he would try to talk to me, I'd often respond with short, quick answers: ""I'm fine."" ""School was good."" ""I'm not hungry"" etc. I know for a fact that in my teenage years he and I really struggled to relate to each other at all, and conversation essentially died. 

This resulted in me not practicing ASL daily like everyone else in my family and I lost a lot of my skill and proficiency.  I can finger spell a lot of things but I forget the actual signs for certain words a lot. I figured it was no big deal, since dad was bound to disown me when I came out anyway.

Cut to me at 19 years old: I had come out to my sisters and mother, and my brother found out I was gay (that's another story all on its own). My mom saved me the trouble of coming out to my dad and sat him down and told him for me. He was initially resistant but my mom assured him I wasnt confused, and he surprised us all by becoming one of my biggest supporters. Ironically the only one in my family who didnt support me was my twin brother.

I have a lot of regret for the way I treated my dad when I was a teenager. I closed myself off and suffered the consequences for it. It's really embarrassing to have a deaf parent and be the worst signer in your family. I'm still working on learning and my dad teaches me as I communicate with him now. I'm really grateful though that I still have the chance to make up for my poor attitude now though."
"I was so ready to fight you after I read the title. I thought you meant the T in LGBT. Lol

But yes, no meth. "
"I don't know where this falls on the scale of unpopularity, but I think as gays (hopefully) find more acceptance, hookup culture/focus on appearances will go down. I'm speaking from experience (so not for the whole community obv), but I believe when we were young we internalized a lot of self-hate and wanting to be straight (to avoid being murdered, to avoid bullying, to be accepted, to not be condemned by our religious parents, etc.). The climate around LGBT acceptance/rejection made it difficult to love ourselves, and one of the ways with compensating is pursuing ideal body standards to try to erase some of the discomfort with who we are. Also, exercising in general is just a great way to deal with stress, purposelessness or loneliness.

It just makes me so frustrated when people say ""oh gays only care about sex and the gym"" like they're superficial, end of story. It's like people forget that just \~8+ years ago the only media we had about LGBT people growing up was AIDS and X person getting killed, mistreated, or dying by suicide. And people act like it's so easy to be gay now (or even get annoyed when people still feel the need to ""come out"") just cause it's legal to marry. Like hello a law about marriage does not  protect  you from dirty stares, parents who might kick you out, social isolation depending on your town, and sometimes yes, still bullying, violence and murder. 

Sorry this sort of turned into a vent. And not to make it sound dramatic because I hate to linger on difficult things. But it's like, we still have problems with race after decades of civil rights movements and exposure to different cultures. It's important to remember LGBT has a narrative too that takes time to find its place and voice. So rather than get caught up in the negatives or judging things superficially, take time and be patient in reflecting on what you want that voice to be."
"&gt;why would they stop now just because you said so?

Because

"&gt; dismembering them and hiding their remains in flower pots at a private home where he worked as a landscaper.

can you imagine how absolutely violated the owners of that home must feel by this? ""wtf, man, you've been killing people and hiding their remains in our flower pots?"""
"A few months after I got my drivers license I drove like 30 miles to hook up with this pretty hot guy at a hotel.  When I went to leave he walked me out to my car where we saw that one of my tires was flat.  I'd never changed a flat tire, and this guy took the time to show me how to do it.  Once he got the spare tire on, it was still like 2am.  While he was still kneeling down he undid my shorts again and gave me another blowjob there in the parking lot between the cars.  Once I came in his mouth again he zipped me up, gave me a pat on the ass, and told me to be safe driving home and reminded me not to go faster than 55mph on the spare.  "
"Not personally, but my better half has a thing for it, to the point where he asks me to hump on his nose and face in my underwear, right after I got back from college.

I have never seen his dick so red and excited before."
Congrats !!! 
I got hard just thinking about it.
"I needed to make a new account just to comment on this because I feel so strongly about it.

A few years ago, I met the most awesome guy ever and knew he had both done and quit meth because of his toxic ex. 
We talked at length about it since I'm a guy that has always been interested in trying something twice. I told him I was always both interested and scared to try meth. He was always adamant that I should never under any circumstances try it since it took him a while to quit himself and hated what it had done to his past relationship and his own body.  I agreed. 

Fast forward a year and we're into a great relationship and we had started living together. He's bartending and suddenly gets fired because some chick accused him of touching her butt while on the job (he's gay and everyone knew it, but the restaurant policy was restaurant policy).
Next thing I know, I'm on a trip during summer and get a call from a nurse that he was in the hospital because he tried jumping off a bridge in the middle of the night.
When I get back, I get him released and we have several in depth conversations. 

Apparently while I was gone he felt so lost and low, due to the no job thing and other issues (ADHD, anxiety, etc) that he couldn't solve because he lost the job, that he saw no other option than to rid his family of friends of having do deal with him. 

I tell him it's that I have enough money saved up for us to live while he gets back on his feet. Although he ended up applying to jobs and getting interviews and even starting a couple, he could never keep them. I didn't know, and found out not long after our first bad fight, that he had reached out to mutual friends of mutual friends and started using again. 

The relationship between began degrading. His friendships that weren't his drug ""friends"" were evaporating. One day we are drinking with friends and he asks me if I want to try. I say kinda, but was not really all that into it since we had been going on a couple month long emotional roller coaster. Ended up going to his ""friends"" hanging out, seeing that they weren't all that crazy while high and just chilled and chatted, then I decided to try smoking it. 

The feeling was...hard to describe. IDK if I was doing it wrong or what, but I only felt slight euphoria. Nothing to what I expected. Yeah I felt a little hornier too. It definitely made us stay up for a long time, but I didn't feel jittery like I do when I have caffeine.  Overall I felt good but still, ""meh what's the bid deal."" When we left, and it started wearing off..that's when it became unbearable. I wanted more. I didn't even extremely enjoy it but I wanted more. It was on my mind for a week straight and that scared me.  

I never have touched it again. Haven't even wanted to. The smell is chemical. The high for me was no more enjoyable than weed (albeit much different). The crash was unbearable. 

It destroyed that relationship. He kept using, but I refused and our time together consisted of seconds a week while he changed clothes or was just in and out to grab something from the house. 

I'm definitely lucky in my experience, but I will NEVER try it a second time. "
"This. OP, it’s worth every risk to report the police and CPS."
Right? Like if any of that shit actually worked it wouldn't be some big secret. We'd all be taking our daily dick vitamin or doing our man-Kegels or whatever the hell else they're selling.
If he's driving yeah
Oh god man. When a guy puts on deodorant and it gets a little musky. 🤤🤤🤤 I used to ask my ex to let me smell his shirt when he changed because it was fucking heaven. 
I think I'm some sort of Wizard Bear but not a hugely powerful one lol. I like your takes on  most powerful classes. Drag Queen spellcasters would be sick. 
"Absolutely correct.  This is where self identity and sexual identity start to clash...and how gay boys become self loathing and deal with a lot of internalized homophobia.  The path is dark, twisted and painful.  "
"I understand. Someone I used to date slash also friend commited suicide 2 years ago. The feeling never goes away, but I play his favourite song the full day every year. Honour his memory perhaps? It can help every year."
A good solution could be to let him invite his friend to sleep at your own house.
"I think we should also acknowledge that there are probably a lot of closeted bisexual and gay guys out there, and part of the reason we feel yanked around by them is because they feel that way internally. Not to say straight guys don't do this. Just that the situation is usually murky as hell and that's part of why it's so shitty. "
"One of my straight friends told me that if he will ever pass out at the party or so, I'm free to give him a blowjob.

Thanks, I guess..."
I have always felt this way.  I found that coming out of the closet sorted out any issues I had with my own masculinity in a real hurry.
"After spending some time here I have reached the conclusion that there is something deeply wrong with a large number of people here.
The amount of delusion, loneliness, body issues, promiscuity, substance abuse, sadness, and maladaptive beliefs is staggering.
I don't why this is so, but the the aimlessness and desperation for genuine human contact that is almost omnipresent here is depressing.
"
"Yeah, I used to be extremely insecure about my dick size even though it's totally average. I measured it and read that the average white dick was around 5 inches, so I knew it was average, but not having any other dicks to compare it to, I was just insecure that it was small. But then I met my bf and realized that average dicks are actually the best, so yeah. "
"don't fall into this thinking please.

the genetic lottery is real, and yes there are real advantages, but it's also not everything.  There are many ways you can show off, without it being solely based on your looks. 

as an 'average' lookin' dude, I've learned other ways. 

and trust me, you say that even if you lost weight... I think you underestimate how much that works. I got like... way hotter when I worked out and dressed a little better.

there are some dudes who people fawn over because they are fit, and have busted faces.

but in the end *that doesn't matter*. you gotta learn how to be happy."
I would be a healer like a true good bottom.
I don’t like drag. It’s just not for me. I hate Rupaul’s drag race
The internet is my oblivious grandma 
"Yes, LGBT youth need help and resources and supportive adults in their lives.

"Seriously, when I hear my straight friends or co-workers talk about their relationships, I don't know how they do it.  It sounds like pure guesswork."
"Some years ago when I was in college, and I was chilling out with some friends after class:

Friend (pointing to a girl who was passing a bit away): Check out the rack on that girl, men!

Me (without thinking): Which one? The one with the pink purse?

Officially my gayest moment. "
It is great that you spoke up. What did HR say? Did she get fired? To my experience (in school) authority figures just gave me lip service but nothing changed. 
Just turned 24 :) Oh well I just built a Plex server to keep me warm at night. Who needs a boyfriend all I need is a 6TB hard drive feeding me TV shows I already watched
Benedict Cumberbatch.  He looks like Kif from Futurama.
"I honestly really miss this feeling.

At 29 and no longer in school, I find myself thrown less and less into interactions with really attractive men. It’s just day in and day out at the office with the same people.

I remember this happening a lot in college and when I worked at an Apple Store. But gone are the days of randomly meeting when people without having to force myself to go out. Haha"
"&amp;#8194;After I came out to my baseball team, no one had a problem with it, but all of a sudden everyone got uncomfortable.  It was in the air, thick as soup.  Problem was, 90% of what was said to teammate was some variation of an emasculating comment.  You know, calling your teammates gay and shit.

&amp;#8194;We were playing a game and I swung n miss a gimmee.  Its was embarrassing as fuck.  The I heard yelled from the dugout, ""*hey, jshatxmscl, your rainbow is looking pretty cloudy!!*""  

&amp;#8194;There was like this pause as the air went still, and then everyone on my team died laughing.  The new rule was made.  We always question guys sexuality when they were sucking?  Fine, same rules, flip genders.

&amp;#8194;It quickly spread to hockey and wrestling.  I have since heard every possible insult questing the validity of my gayness."
"Was introduced to his family once...  as ""the guy who I'm gonna fuck""  his mom said ""cool. I'll  have coffee and snacks ready for after"".

"Me 24, never had a relationship. Currently recovering from depression and anxiety. Thank god my parent still let me stay even though I'm just shit ass time bomb closeted gay.

Reddit makes me sane at least, memes and stories are good mind filler."
The article states many of the people he killed were newly-moved and sometimes homeless immigrants. They only noticed when a white man was killed probably because immigrants and homeless people can go under the radar very easily  as they probably don’t have family or connections here while a [native] white man does. 
I love when my grandma provides me with straight porn!
"24 is still very young. You've got plenty of time. The best advice I can give you is that if you want to be happy, start living your life the way you want. 

If you're worried about rent eating up all your money, find a roommate. Websites like Rentler and Craigslist are a good place to start. 

If school is too hard, I'd also recommend starting with a two year Associate's degree. They tend to be a bit easier to get and it looks better on a resume to at least say you have some sort of degree. Once you've got that you can worry about turning it into a Bachelor's degree at a later time. 

Don't dwell on wishing you could redo the past, just focus on making the future what you want it to be. "
I wish I had such a sister so I could come out. Give her a hug on my behalf and tell her some anonymous closeted gay guy wanted to appreciate her effort and kindness.
Yeah I kind of bunch my blanket up so it feels like I am cuddling/sleeping with someone 😂.
Make your wife sit down and watch a film called Prayers For Bobby (based on a true story). Then she’ll see the damage that religious parents do by rejecting their gay child.
"The police handled this whole thing terribly.  At one point they had the guy in custody and let him go.

I hope the investigation into how this went on results in change. They need to do more to protect vulnerable people."
"I like to pretend to be straight at bars, have women buy me a drinks, dance with them, flirt all night, and then when they start getting handsy, I whisper in their ear “I like cock as much as you do” then I sashay away. "

"That's a part of it.  First think about what a small portion of the overall population is gay.  Then the even smaller part of that small portion are of the younger age who are interested in apps.   If you don't live in a large city, you're just going to see the same small number of guys over and over.   The only way you'll meet the rest is to get offline and go places to see the guys who never use apps."
"Yeah man. I used to get with this guy who loved to drink beer, but it would always make him soft. We'd spend most of our time making out, but I loved playing with his soft cock. He was embarrassed at first, but got over that when he realized we were having a good time, lol."
Yes! And i also enjoy just looking at soft dick
I get random straight porn clips sometimes and it's weird. 
"Healing seed: a true good bottom takes in the seed of a god granting nearby allies a healing over time effect for 5 rounds.

Fist of the Goddess: the true good bottom is able to take many hits due to their blessing from the Goddess, the good bottom places a shield on themselves and an ally that reduces all incoming damage to 10% of the target's current health for 5 rounds.

"Yeah, ""straight"" guys are always messaging me.on dating apps at 3am. It's weird. They always want me to watch them jack off, and comment on it, like I'm a sports broadcaster or something."
"hook ups are gross, to me.

i also dislike those gays who play into the role of a woman's gay best friend, because now when i say I'm gay these mutual female friends come out of the woodwork and ask if i want to go to gay bars with them or go shopping. "
"I don’t understand half of what you said, but I’m still going to give it an unreserved YAAAAASSSSS QUEEN! Lol!  "
"Yep... and weirdly enough they have the same pictures too. Maybe they're happy on the apps, but personally, I always wish to one day be able just to delete them all, when I finally found the fabled ""The One.""

Sometimes I take breaks, three months, one year... so when I come back and see it's the same crop of guys, I feel uninspired, but at the same time there is that level of familiarity and comfort too."
"What of my favorite things that my boyfriend and I do is if one of us goes in for a kiss or something the other goes ""ew what are you, gay?"""
It means that they're completely clueless and that you can one-up them by finding a decent bloke to start a monogamous relationship with.
"All of that is the result of living in a society that has foundations in the belief that homosexuality is wrong.  Intimacy, sensuality, romance and other aspects of human connection are not as easily accessible to gay people as they are for heterosexual people.  If people could just be gay and not have to worry about things such as coming out, whether family will be accepting, whether employers will be accepting, etc. their attitudes going about finind connection would be very different. This behavior that bothers you isn't necessarily just how gay people are, it's behavior that has evolved over time as gay people had to navigate finding human connection in a much different way than straight people."
"I mean, I'm into older guys too he just didnt look 16"

"Well, and given the relationship between LGBTQ homelessness and risk-taking behaviors like drug use, I'm especially glad this dad didn't let the mom kick the son out. 

My mom was very religious, and I grew up very religious, and gave me the whole line about ""not God's plan for you."" I asked my mom when she knew me to be someone who did deeply sinful things, or someone who chose what was wrong over what was right. I also told her that what she wasn't seeing was the years I wrestled with this aspect of myself all alone because I couldn't count on her to talk to, and so for her not to think this was something I took lightly or I just decided on a whim--this was just a long-time coming and she didn't know it. Those seemed to sink in. 

Good parents come around. But I'm impressed as hell that this dad did the right thing because I know how easy it can be to fold to a partner even when they're in the wrong. "

"And the Bible also says that most important law is love, and that to hate someone is equivalent to murder in your heart. 

Basically, she missed some *very* major things about Christianity somehow if she thinks that it's okay for her to have anything but unconditional love for her son. Love people with the same strength that you love God. When same sex things are brought up in the NT, it's almost always in the context of rape or prostitution, *or* Paul (or another letter writer) being surprised by what's he's seeing. He also is commenting on the prevalence of the older man/young boy sexual relationships, and how that's wrong because of the blatant disregard for consent.

"I’m a Mechanical Engineering major in college, and I had to take a class on machining; basically taking blocks of metal and putting them on lathes and milling machines to cut them into parts. It’s a very uber-masculine environment, and you always leave the class covered in metal chips, and reeking of machine oil. 

My section was taught by this very deadpan man. Think Jamie from the Mythbusters, but younger. So one class, I had just finished a particularly hard operation, and called my instructor over to check my work. He looks it over and gives a very rare “Good Job.” so I let out a reflexive “YAAAS!” 

And there’s an awkward silence, that felt way longer than it probably was. 

And he just goes “Yes.” And hands me the instructions for the next part. I was embarrassed for like a second, but then I felt proud that I’d brought a little gay into the machine shop."

"There's a reason for this - **pheremones**. Males produce androstenol, after working out. It is the scent produced by fresh male sweat, and is meant to attract females and show a mate - ""hey, this an active guy who can protect me and my young."" Presumably it also attracts gay guys.

It should be noted that male pheromones are not equally attractive. The male pheromone androstenone is not the same as androstenol. Androstenol is the scent produced by fresh male sweat, and is attractive to females. Androstenone is produced by male sweat after exposure to oxygen – i.e. when less fresh – and is perceived as highly unpleasant by everyone. It's the BO smell."
"-The gay community is exceptionally more shallow than their straight counterparts no matter how much they swear they aren't. Looks seem to dictate any and everything in the gay community, even outside dating/hooking up.

-Hooking up on occassion is fine, but it seems to be a chronic issue in the gay community. It's sad that we have to ask ""Where can I find someone looking for a serious relationship"" opposed to ""How to find a one night stand"" 

-Race plays a huge part in the gay community whether we talk about it or not. "
All my close friends are heterosexual.
"Don’t worry about it. You’re good looking. Also sex isn’t a big deal, I was in my mid 20s before I did anything and even then I didn’t think it was that incredible. A whole lot of gay men only start dating later in life so you have nothing to worry about, you’re not an anomaly"
"Just go in and have fun. I know straight people who go to gay bars and get hit on. Once you’re in and one hits on you, if you like them, tell them you’re down. Some gay guys will flirt regardless of your orientation and that’s you opportunity to tell that person (if interested) that you’re attracted to them. You don’t have to say you’re bi because it’s not like you’re not interested in men. But if you want to tell them that. If they want you they will make it work. "
You are what all gay kids wish for in a parent. You showed true unconditional love and I wish I could give you a big hug and support through this.

"He didn't just kill one white man either, he killed another white guy Dean Lisowick a year before that and it went unnoticed. 

The reason that the disappearance of Kinsman raised a lot of eyebrows is because he was deeply involved in the Toronto gay community, volunteered with various organizations and was very active on social media. The other guys weren't. 

The allegations of racism are unfounded and stupid. "
"I like shorter guys. In general, height isn’t really a deciding factor for a relationship imo."

"Absolutely! I'm all about pits, balls, ass(as long as it's not ripe) and inside the foreskin. Actually, ripe pits get me going.

 

That said, there is a fine line for me. The guy has to be *normally* clean; i.e., he showers regularly and only has a smell because he's fresh out of the gym, working all day, etc., not someone who smells because they're unhygienic. That would be too much."

"I’d still be careful. I’m 22 and there’s a huge difference in how I approach sex now vs when I was 17-18. Not a lawyer, but I imagine the reason statutory is placed is partly because minors don’t normally have the sexual experience to understand what sex means, even if they have done some things (not to say that there aren’t adults who don’t understand sex, but that’s a whole other conversation).

Point: Having sex with someone who is in a wildly different place both sexually and in life can mess with your own sexual and personal development. Proceed with caution. "
"You can spank your child (though this varies by municipality), you can even spank them with a belt, but you can't give them 30-40 lashes with a belt.  You can't maliciously destroy property that you have no part in purchasing.  And yes, there are laws against emotional abuse. "

"I'm not a male or gay, but stumbled into this sub 

But I just wanna say I've had to cut off my brother from my life completely, I won't say it doesn't hurt, it was confusing at first but that sick feeling does become minimal with time. My reasons for cutting him off stem from a  different type of pain but I hope these words help in any way.

Letting yourself experience pain and a feeling of betrayal again and again because someone shares a blood bond with you is worse than exercising your right to move on with your life. 

If anything maybe just distance yourself and let her know why you are doing it, if you feel this is a better way to handle it. 

Also you are about to start a new family with someone you love, its obviously a different type of relationship than a sibling but nonetheless it is filled with love! (Congratulations btw) "
"I once had a guy come up to me in a club and say:

“I’m not gay, but I find you quite attractive”

I look like a boy, talk like a boy, dress like a boy. The dude proceeded to make out with me and run off 30 seconds later.

Heteros are weird."
My friend used to know people who did this in high school years ago. The older guys were blackmailed into dating them and still can't leave it because the younger folks will let out the news even though they initially lied about being older. It sounds like something out of Shameless.....just so toxic and knowingly fucked up without understanding the full depth of consequences.

"Funny enough, my twin realized I was gay because I came home from hanging out with a ""friend"" at the time and had a hickey. He tried tackling me to the ground and my mom and friend had to pull him off of me. The entire time he was screaming at the top of his lungs ""do you know what this is going to do to MY reputation?!""

He ended up not talking to me for 3 days, until he called me in tears. I asked him what was wrong and he said he had told all his friends that I was gay and none of them cared. I forgave him for what he had said at the time until the next time he got angry with my mother a few years later and said it to her in the heat of the moment: ""I'm sorry I'm not a faggot like fluorescent_noir so you'd like me more.""

I stopped giving him chances after that. I still say hello to him at family gatherings but I make no more effort to have a relationship with him. He's a nasty person with an ugly heart and I refuse to give him a pass for it any longer."
Honestly this. I know for myself before I started fooling around with guys I was convinced I had a small dick from watching too much porn.

"I don't think so. Maybe it's related to a maturity in relationship/sex i still not have...

I don't think you're less than a men - in fact, manhood/virility always seemed me more true in f2m transgender, you feel it has been there all along, that it's not fake. 

But regarding sex, i'm not sure i would be able to be attracted to a body who have feminine parts. The dick being one of the things that attracts me the most on a man, that's also a problem.

Like i said : it could change with time, and i'm not representative of anyone else than me on that subject."
"I was with this exchange student whose spoken English wasn't the greatest so he had a lot of go to words or phrases he'd use all the time rather than trying to formulate a sentence on the fly.

"To date there has been no study conclusively proving the existence of human pheromones. It’s entirely possible that humans do secrete pheromones, but no one chemical has yet been identified as a true pheromone. "
"I shut out both my parents when I was about six. You know how kids go back to their parents for reassurance when they mess up? I felt like I could not and soon learned that I have to fend for myself. I think a lot of factors contributed to my situation including me being gay but not understanding what that meant, living in a small town homophobic conservative society, turbulent home life, etc.

It took me almost 25 years to realize that I had completely rejected my dad and had a need-based relationship with my mom. I also isolated myself from my brother. When I decided to come out to my parents, I was prepared, expecting, and almost hoping that they would disown me. But... they did not. Instead, they chose to stay in my life and fight with me... lol

At one point, my dad asked me 'Why didn't you tell us this before?'.

I replied 'I wanted to be financially independent in. case you disowned me.'

He was very shocked to hear me say this and said 'You're my son. How can I disown you?'

It has been almost a decade since I came out to my parents. They are still not very happy about me being gay but our relationship has improved greatly. I have come to realize that I shut them out because of fear and that I actually love them very much. They have come to realize that they just want me to be happy even though they may not understand or accept everything I do. It's a much healthier adult relationship and not necessarily a parent-child sort of relationship at this point. 

It took a lot of painful conversations, emotional explosions, awkward interactions, and intentional effort for me to rebuild my relationship with my parents. It's a work in progress and I am very grateful that they did not disown me. "
And the police only took notice when a white man went missing! Unbelievable 😤

Africans are homophobic as fuck and while my parents sometimes aren’t the typical African pair you’d expect, I still prefer not to take chances. 
While I haven’t gotten to the point of outright being cold to my parents, I don’t really open up about much in terms of my social life. Idk if they talk about it between themselves, but a lot of my friends know I’m gay and I’d much rather prevent any slip ups. "

Three couples, two straight and one gay, are on a cruise when the ship gets hit by a tidal wave. The ship capsizes and they all drown and find themselves before St. Peter.

The first straight couple goes up and asks St. Peter ""Can we enter heaven?""

St. Peter replies ""You, sir, are a glutton! You have always loved food more than anything else. You love food so much that you even married a woman named Candy!"" In a puff of smoke, they are sent to Hell.

The second straight couple goes up and asks St. Peter ""Can we enter heaven?""

St. Peter replies ""You, sir, are greedy! You have always loved money more than anything else. You love money so much that you even married a woman named Penny!"" In a puff of smoke, they are sent to Hell.

At this point, one of the gay guys leans over to his partner and whispers ""It's not looking good, Dick."""
"As a bi guy, all relationships regarded of sex have its own set of issues. Saying one is much easier than the other is a bad generalization.

"There is nothing wrong with you or those feelings. Your expressions of intimacy may differ from someone else's and cuddling is often seen - especially in the gay community - as more intimate than sex sometimes.

I'm bisexual so I occasionally watch straight porn too and I'm jealous sometimes I don't have a vagina. Not because I want to be a girl, but because of how fucking awesome it seems it feels to get fucked and play with yourself. Especially orgasming and squirting... 

Don't get me wrong though, I love being a dude and would never in a million years wish to be a woman, but I've always wondered what it would feel like to have a vagina and get fucked. "

"It’s the time involved in transitioning too, as well as how these changes were presented to many service members.

Typical enlistment is four years.  Usually with a 6-9 month deployment somewhere during that time (in the Nav6y.  Navy policy was that a service member transitioning was to take at least three years if not longer.  

In regards to how the changes were presented to service members.  They were told they could no longer change in front of each other.  Which in a berthing, where upwards of 80 people share racks and bathrooms, this presents a major hurdle to having to wait for an open shower or toilet stall to change your uniform.  As well, locker rooms where going to be affected similarly. 

Honestly, there’s nothing inherent in a trans-person to preclude them from serving.  I’ve already served with a few.  

What made me worry was the incentive he Obama Admin put in place, where the surgery would be paid for.  In this, I’ve had other friends who I’ve known since we were young that have since transitioned.  The (lack of a better word) strife they went through in learning about themselves isn’t something that anyone should have to go through in combat, or even a sea deployment.  

The incentive of paying for the surgery, and essentially starting that process the day they report to their first command make me think that some would unduly burden themselves to achieve something they feel they so deeply need.  In a very real sense this is worse than lauding a $10K enlistment bonus over teenagers who only see “easy money”.  

So, again, I think the Obama Admin went too far.  Perhaps rolling transition surgery into the already in place sabbatical program the military has is a better option.  

"
I'm definitely there. I'm 36 and haven't even come close to any semblance of a meaningful relationship in well over a decade. I live in GA--outside of metro Atlanta--Grindr is pretentious. I work nights. It just seems impossible.
Just say Sean Cody loudly and see who turns around.
"*gave me a pat on the ass*

Holy fuck reading that turned me on"
"No, Karen, I don't want to go clothes shopping on you.

No, Greg, you smell like you haven't showered in a week, I'm not going to touch your penis if you let your guard down"
Not. Even. Once. 
"If by sex you mean anal? You don’t have to do anal, I’ve been in relationships that didn’t involve anal."
"I was on Grindr when I was 16, and had the looks of someone much older. I ended up getting a BJ from a guy, til this day, I regret misleading the guy into thinking I was older. DO NOT HOOK-UP WHILE UNDER 18, jesus. "
Channing Tatum. He looks a little..... dopey? 
"No, the forbidden arts! "
"I had a friend who is “ straight”. I put it in quotes because this is the gayest man I have ever met. But the main cue to me is that he is constantly, loudly, inappropriately yelling about how much he LOVES VAGINA. Sure you do buddy. Sure you do "
"&gt; I don't think so. Maybe it's related to a maturity in relationship/sex i still not have...

This is why I think that the postmodern queer/transgender movement is genuinely regressive and harmful to young gay people. There are two groups that are actively pushing the idea that lack of attraction to opposite-sex bodies is a psychological problem: the anti-gay conversion therapists of the religious right and the woke liberals/queer activists/trans lobbyists of the left.

You don't need to be ""inclusive"" of everyone in your sexuality. That is a completely unhealthy way of thinking about sexuality. You have the right to your sexual orientation and your personal boundaries just as much as the straight guys who don't want to see dick (other than their own) in their beds."
"Yes.  Late 90s and early 2000s porn had a lot of this which I enjoyed.  Seems to be a dying trend, sadly.  "
"I would talk to him and tell him exactly what you said here and how you feel that you two shouldn't ever give into physical fighting.  

Just be the first to apologize, even if you don't feel like it, it usually makes the other person feel heard.  5 years sounds much stronger than a little pushing. "
"You did everything right. You stop speaking to your wife and wait until she comes to apologize. If she doesn’t, there are lawyers for that. It’s a harsh recommendation, but the reality is that when you decided to have a child together, you both agreed to put *him* first – and he’s done nothing wrong (and, to reiterate, neither have you). She’s entirely in the wrong here, one thousand percent. Sadly, your own pain will have to take a backseat to your son’s for now.

Your primary job now is to reach out to your son and show him you’re there and that you care. Part of that is making sure he understands what she did was absolutely unacceptable, and that not only does he hold no blame for it, that you don’t blame him. The other part is distracting him – take him to the movies, play video games with him, invite his friends over, whatever it takes, really, to distract him from the emotional pain he’s in, due to his mother. Part of that will mean he needs to go to school, but you should make sure he’s relatively stable before he does.

Likewise, I suggest getting him a therapist. Nobody likes the idea (especially as a teenager), but it can help a lot to talk through your feelings with someone who isn’t involved in them.

He’ll be alright, and you will, too. 

Thanks for being a great father."
its even more awkward seeing people youve dated again 😂
"Yes, anytime Toxic by Brittney is on. I can't help but sing and dance like a slut, whipping my imaginary hair. I'll be feeling my fill fantasy for those 4 minutes then go back to being unclockable. "
"Ehhhhh, it’s like 30 or 31 states. Some of the most populous states have it at 17 (New York, Texas) or 18 (California, Florida), though, so it does shift a large portion of the population into the “above 16” category. "
He told me I was better at blowjobs than his wife.
"Hearken:

If you crush on him, he is straight.

This is the first law of homodynamics"
What’s his race? Seriously curious 
"Woah, that’s pretty serious"
I'm currently dating a FTM man and he is the best thing that has ever happened to me. He's not a joke and neither are you. We've been together for over a year now and neither of us wants it to ever end.
I failed a class in college because I was distracted by a boy in that class.  
"But we're already joking around, so how do I know you're serious about sucking dick and not just playing along"
Damn I got turned on by just reading your comment. Cause of your pc that can run Crysis ofcourse. 
"So, for reference I am 8 x 5.5 inches. 

Pros: 
-	Sounds weird, but it feels nice having something substantial in your pants and having a nice bulge that people eye
-	Fun to slap around and shake. It’s kind of hilarious. Big floppy dicks are funny.
-	Surprising people when they take your underwear off. When you’re having a shit day it can be nice to have a little ego boost.

Cons:
-	Some people will not want to bottom for you.
-	May require a LOT of foreplay and/or poppers to get the bottom to be comfortable
-	I feel bad when people say it hurts; or in some cases, they look really uncomfortable but say they really enjoy it, so... 
-	Sometimes it seems like the only thing people like about you (from a sex standpoint) is your cock."
"The amount of people on here who think the boyfriend wanting his partner to be healthy, lose weight and look good is a bad thing is ridiculous. 

It's not superficial or shallow, if you pass it off as being that, in an effort to protect your own insecurities -yes, potentially regarding your own health issues- then you're on a fast track to a miserable outlook on what a relationship should be. Perhaps already there."
Ryan Gosling. He just looks so generic I've seen tons of guys hotter than him everyday but people seem to lose their shit over him.
"As a gay, I can confirm that most gays aren't different. :\\

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry friend."
"I think the millennial generation is more open with their sexuality. It’s less of a taboo now than it was in the past. As time passes and acceptance becomes the norm in more places , numbers will become more accurate. "
"As some other commenters have mentioned, I think you should ask him to invite a friend or two over to spend the night at your place if he needs support.  He needs to understand that his home is HIS home.  Tell him this.  I would tell him that you're upset and worried about him and that him staying with you would make you feel better.  I really think you guys need to spend time together so that he can see how much you love and support him.  Good luck, you're a good Dad."
And if you're not a legal consenting adult don't lie about your age just so you can get laid. That's so fucking unethical and underage guys do this shit all the time. 
"I'm the only gay guy in my friend group, and we all call each other faggots. I know none of us are actually homophobic or anything, so it's fun to joke about being gay or being straight. We're just dudes being bros. "
"Totally agree — u/forabirkin great one.

u/FakeThrowawayAcct39, you’re an awesome dad!

Lots of great advice in all the replies.  Just wanted to add a couple of quick resources.  I hope they help.  The religion position with some people is a difficult one.  These are not meant as tit-for-tat counterpoints for stoking arguments - these are meant to enlighten people who are willing to grow.

Matthew Vines has an excellent video about what the Bible says about being gay.  It’s linked here:

A TEDx talk given by two ordained ministers in their respective churches:
https://youtu.be/XGNZQ64xiqo


Thank you for being an awesome dad!  Definitely get you and your son and hopefully your wife to PFLAG.

Your son is feeling super alone right now!  Be with him, help him see that being LGBTQ+ is not a shame.  Most cities have an LGBTQ+ resource center that can help you find safe events and activities that you and your son can attend.

Take him to Pride when it comes up in your city.  Many have a space for Teen Pride or Family Pride zones, which is a great place to make friends for parents and gay teens alike.

One last thought for you kindest dad, is that parents of kids that play sports often attend their child’s sporting events to cheer.  Think of these as exactly the same kinds of activities — show your son you support him by being there with him."
"I'm not sure... there's this FTM porn actor that's making the rounds recently, and he's really attractive, like I wouldn't mind dating someone like him.

But the bummer is that there isn't a dick to play with, and neither would a dildo or a strap-on make adequate replacements... so I'm not so sure about the sex part of the relationship"
"What is your sister planning to say to her kids when they are older? Or when you decide that that relationship is no longer heathy? 
I understand our sexuality doesn't define us. But who we love does. If you choose to accept your sisters view on this I'm afraid that you'll hurt your relationship with your boyfriend. Have you discussed this with your SO? What are his views, how does he feel?
What will you be giving up in either case?"
Consider for the majority of America age of consent is 16 like most of the world. That usually won’t happen. 
"In the book The Velvet Rage, psychologist Alan Downs argues it comes from a lack of authentic validation. We miss out on childhood/adolescent stages of confirming our identify because we are in hiding. We seek validation elsewhere because we're afraid to be honest with ourselves and our loved ones about our sexuality. Can't speak for others but this was definitely me as a gay kid in a conservative town. Struggled with lots of those problems, still working on some. It can be depressing to witness so much pain (been crying since I heard about Jussie Smollett), but there's reason to be optimistic too. Society is changing. And this sub is a great place for those that are struggling alone to reach out. So when you see someone is having a hard time with these issues, have hope that by reaching out they will find the tools to grow and overcome the obstacles in their life. And remember that social media is an imperfect and incomplete snapshot of our existence. There's more to the gay community than the problems listed above. Be kind to each other, y'all."
I mean he glanced in my general direction three weeks ago! What was I supposed to do? **Not** instantly fall in love and obsessive?
This community has a HUGE racism problem.
"It depends on the bar and the night. 

You’ll be very welcome at a mixed crowd dance club. 

You shouldn’t bring your friend to a dark, sleazy leather bar. "
*plays porn on the Bluetooth speaker*
"What an absolutely beautiful post.  Very moving about your dad.  I'm not surprised about your twin brother.  One thing to consider is that he might have gotten shit from his friends about you.  I've known siblings of gay men who were *themselves* bullied for having a gay brother.  Perhaps your twin worries that others assume that he's gay as well (I've seen that happen a number of times, too).  How are things with him now?"
"My husband is 5'4, former twink, now muscley twunk.  Italian, dark hair, beard, bottom.... the whole package. (Now both in our 30's) We've been together for 9 years and he has ALWAYS gotten tons of attention.  I'm not saying 'tons' lightly.... we've been at bars and drunk guys have literally picked him up and started to walk off with him.  He's been propositioned so many times while I'm sitting right next to him and been felt up by passersbys ad nauseam.  One time I recall, a 'pack' of 20 somethings surrounded him talking about how they were 'looking for a bottom to pass around' that night.  Needless to say, I swooped in and saved my short guy from the hyenas. I used to get irritated by it, by this many years in, I just smile as I'm the one hes going home with.  I can't say I personally only find short guys attractive, but theres a huge population that he's apparently catnip to. "
Are dicks supposed to get red
"And he passes the 20..the 10 ...the 5, oh e fumbled it at the 1 yard line. What a fuck up. "
"The music that most gay guys like is awful, it is just the same pop and dance drabble sung in a different key. "
"I doubt they can hear you beat off. Probably in your head. But you could always buy a bluetooth speaker for your room and your sister's. Suggest they play white noise or natural sounds so you can't hear their conversations and other noises at night. Also, if you have a closet, maybe go in there. The clothes would act as a natural sound absorber. Lots of podcasters use the closet as a makeshift recording studio for this reason."
My bf and I do the same. That and say we’re just practicing for when we both get girlfriends. 
That there isn't a 'man' and 'woman' roleset in a gay relationship. We're both men!
All the dick sucking 
"Fun Fact: there are actually two kinds of sweat glands, eccrine and apocrine. Apocrine sweat glands are the kind that produce the sweat we all know and love, but if there is too much bacteria around your underarms it gets that rank smell we know as BO instead of that musky smell we love after a nice sweat. "
After a nice session I went to the bathroom to grab some towels for him and when I got back he was sound asleep. He’s was so cute with his ass in the air I just let him be. He apologized profusely in the morning saying he was extremely exhausted. Funny/Sweet imo 
"Maybe i'm wrong, but i believe there are strong laws to erase that kind of things of the net, at least in Europe... And you could charge him bad for what he did.

But anyway, the first thing you can do, here, is maybe to contact pronhub for them to delete it ?"
"Adding more qualifiers to an already tiny dating pool is going to make things even more difficult.

We're already restricted by:
*Men (49% of population)
*Same-sex attracted (3-4%, or higher depending on whom you ask)
*Within your geographic area (a couple percent depending on population density)
*Within your age range (cut in half again)

That's already a small number of you start from the world population.

Then adding something like dick size cuts out another percentage; muscular does more to cut it as well; and masculine breaks it further.

You're left with such a tiny, tiny portion of the population- not to mention they have to find you attractive back- that it's a miracle *anyone* finds someone.

But luckily it only takes one."
"This is a good problem to have. The flipside of this is *not getting one* when it's needed.
Relax, just let it be.
After a while you'll either get used to them and not get an erection, or you'll get used to having an erection around them. It's perfectly natural and acceptible."
"With words, my guy "
"Robert Pattinson. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ugh."
"I do not know what sounds Grindr makes because I never have them on, so a lack of reaction is not necessarily indicative of straightness. "
And as an 18 year old I hate this lmao
"My friend's dad once said to me at a party:
&gt;""Double0w07, you're so cool mate, you could be hit by a car and still be cool""
I'm kept awake wondering still how I should feel about this."
This sounds like something I start laughing at. It really doesn't sound sexy at all.
"""So yeah, I was looking at possibly switching jobs soon and uh, SEAN CODY you know, the markets kinda saturated..."" "
"No. I’m applauding him for doing the right thing.  It takes balls of steel to stand up to your spouse sometimes.  As for the rest of what you said, that’s not for either of us to decide.  So, we can just agree to disagree.  "
"Maybe I should wear/buy something covered by pied de poule. He would love it.
Or play ad libitum this song, we like it a lot:

"If I were you, go on YouTube and play that Grindr notifications around him and see if he reaches for his phone. "
When guys on tinder or Grindr message me “come over and cuddle :)” I’m a little creeped out for some reason. I find cuddling more intimate than one night stands and don’t ask strangers to cuddle. 
"I like to suck it soft until it gets hard, shoots off, and goes soft again"
"bud. hard truth time. you could get way 'hotter', and you'll still be miserable because you have a shit attitude. 

join a group of people who like the shit that you do. if you're so friendly and extroverted, you'll find people easily. either there is something you're not telling us, or you're letting your own expectations get in the way of your happiness.

based off the couple pictures I stalked, you're not ugly. you don't have any life ruining physical mal-formations. you'll be okay.

if you're uncomfortable about something, do what you can to change it. Go to the gym, look into other clothes, find a hobby. 

if you hate yourself, then you need to see a professional, or talk to a close friend or family member. "
Only “as much”?
"Or child pornography. If they have nude pictures of them and they send it, or you send pictures of you thinking they are of age. Boom, some zealot of a prosecutor now has you on possessing, transmitting, and soliciting child pornography. Then, to get the ""victim"" to turn on you and become states evidence they threaten to charge them, yes the ""child"", with child pornography unless they support the charges against you.

If you think being in prison for statutory rape is bad go in as a ""child molesting child pornographer"" and see how long you last."
