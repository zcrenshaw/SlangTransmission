"If he was a millionaire from Dubai, he would have someone else wire him money."
"You gotta play the long game for this one. This is what you do:

1. Meet the minimum qualifications for prospective officers.
2. Take the New York City civil service exam.
3. Complete an online application.
4. Pass the medical exam.
5. Complete the personal character assessment.
6. Complete oral and written psychological assessments.
7. Pass the physical abilities test.
8. Appear for a pre-hire interview.
9. Infiltrate the police academy after doing the above and complete police academy training.
10. Begin working as an officer with the NYPD.
11. Get in a patrol car
12. Start looking for the reckless drivers who run red lights and start writing tickets therefore snitching on them to the Dept of Finance

This should achieve what you are trying to do."
"I've been around a lot of people with autism.  You have to have blunt conversations with many of them.  Many of them really don't understand the problem until it's spelled out in very specific details.  ""You are scaring young women by doing this specific behavior.""  ""People will call the police on you if you block driveways.""  And most don't understand attempts to validate their feelings so I personally don't try that anymore.  Ask him if he has a case worker or counselor and then let them know he needs help understanding his community behavior.

Edit: Many people with autism are trained to tell everyone at school ""Hello"" and receive and acknowledge hellos as part of their therapy.  I knew a child that was trained to hug everyone until he started hugging everyone including strangers and homeless.  They can be very literal to an exacting degree."
I carry napkins in my bag because as soon as I stop moving to wait for the train it seems to signal to my body that now is the time to sweat bullets. It’s gross.
"He's probably got a huge box of that ""gold"" jewelry in his van."
No. It is gross and not remotely funny.
"Teaching in NYC is certainly tough. Admin can be capricious, kids aren't fooled by anything and parents can be non-existent or actively malevolent in their kid's lives. But not all are. In for 18 years now in rough middle and high schools in the Bronx here. Being able to change lives by helping young people learn how to navigate the world with skill and purpose is rewarding, but it's a long slow haul. You may not see the end result of your efforts, but you will have an effect. The work is good, and is finally somewhat decently compensated in the city. I know that the stability and reliable framework that the union provides is one that I appreciate. Some days it sucks! But in the end, I find the feeling that I am able to do so much to make the world a better and more informed place in a classroom, that it is worth it in the end. Plus summers. And a decent pension. "
"He's 76 years old *now*. I know he lives a relatively healthy lifestyle, but I have to wonder if an 80 year old will be able to handle the rigors of the campaign trail."
"Because their books are made of Swiss cheese, cooked to perfection on a flat top."
"Governors Island is open late on Fri/Sat nights. You can bring food and have a picnic during sunset or rent bikes and ride around the island. 

If you have a NYC ID, the ferry ride is free and you don’t have to wait on line. "
"Wow that’s fucked up. 

I once had a young British guy at the Times Sq 42nd St. subway station ask to borrow my phone because (he was lost or something idk). I almost did, but thought about how easily he could just run away with it. So I said “I’m sorry, I’m sure you’re a good person, but this is New York... I just can’t.”

I was *really* glad I did that, because about 1 minute later 2 NYPD officers walked by, and he ducked and got away from them. If he *really* needed help contacting someone like he claimed, he would’ve been excited to see the officers and receive help. 

Sad world. "
"It's the high holy days (Rosh Hashanah right now, Yom Kippur next week) and the people contacting you are Lubavitchers--adherents to a sect of Hasidic Judaism.  It's a mega mitzvah (good deed) to bring lost Jews back into the fold so they ask people on the street if they're Jewish, and if they are, they invite them to say some prayers and participate in some way in the holiday.  It might be putting on Tefillin, or blowing the shofar, or saying some Shabbat prayers, whatever.  The ultimate hope is that they help someone reconnect with their faith and that's a really, really good deed for Chabad folks.  It's kind of their whole mission.   Jewish people don't evangelize to non-Jews but this is sort of the Jewish brand of it.  It's kind of our ""Do you have a moment to talk about Jesus Christ?"" sect.  They mean no harm to anyone but if you're not Jewish, you're not allowed to be persuaded to become one (prospective converts have to prove that they really, really want to convert of their own free will) but I imagine it can be a little insulting or grating at the very least.  I am a completely unobservant Jew and they annoy me but I know they mean well.

"You know what’s fun? Waking up on a Saturday / Sunday and not being hung over. Your weekends feel so much longer and more fulfilling. I recently quit drinking and this has been enough for me. You just need to get a few weeks of no booze under your belt, it’s worth it"
They build it in so they only deal with round numbers and make it easier to manage a register with change - or they're not probably reporting (all of) their taxes and income. Whichever it is makes it easier for both them and the customer when it comes to transactions.
"NYC doesn't tax most grocery items (e.g. non-prepared foods) since everyone has to eat and they don't want to add a tax burden to feeding their voters.  This explains it: [https://www.tax.ny.gov/pubs\_and\_bulls/tg\_bulletins/st/listings\_of\_taxable\_and\_exempt\_food.htm](https://www.tax.ny.gov/pubs_and_bulls/tg_bulletins/st/listings_of_taxable_and_exempt_food.htm)

Also, what others have noted is likely true (tax included in price and/or tax is not collected on cash sale).  What's also likely is that merchants in NYC are applying tax where it isn't required.  I've been to bars where they include tax in the price if you pay cash and they add an additional 8.875% if you pay with a card."
"I used to have a neighbor like this. Nice guy who clearly was autistic/something off. He would follow me through the hallway to my front door and he would shake my hand and refuse to let go. He meant well but dealing with him every day was exhausting.

The people saying ""have empathy"" don't get it. I'm not sure if there's anything you can realistically do though. He's not really breaking any laws, and if he is they aren't ""bad"" enough for there to be any real enforcement. I think this is probably one of those situations where you have to either deal with it or move. The guy in my building didn't bother me enough for me to move because of him but we moved for other reasons. 

Good luck"
"Dude OP wants to know what Reddit thinks, not some science bullshit. "
311 or move out.
It's even worse in winter time when you're in a full on parka or wool coat and then you get down to the devil's sauna. Have no fear-- everyone else is sweating with you.
"It might be better to post this question in a sub that is more geared towards engaging people with mental issues. They will understand the problem better and give you a better answer than a sub geared towards New York.

That said, I had an annoying highly autistic classmate in grad school. He just wanted to talk and we would say hello or have a short conversation with him if we could to make him happy. If we were in a hurry or wanted to go, we'd just say ""Hi X, sorry I can't talk today, I'll see you later!"". No idea if that will help with this guy but I guess my advice would be be polite and friendly but concise and assertive when you need to disengage."
"Live in BK, work in QNS. Very rarely go to the city. Last time I was there was 4 months ago."
"My commute time tripled today from 30 minutes to 90 minutes due to a MTA power outage that took out the entire east side.  
  
Nixon: this is bad and should be fixed  
Cuomo: there is no state money to fix this and it is not my problem it is the mayor's problem  
  
  
I then went to the doctor today and they tried to charge me $3000 out of pocket for a blood test.  
  
Nixon: this is bad and should be fixed   
Cuomo: there is no state money to fix this and it is not my problem it is your problem you fucking poor person"
"Yea, someone else in this sub mentioned experiencing the same scenario, san kids, 

Scam. "
Are there people really falling for this? Can we get an AMA of someone who fell for this? 
"Not sure this will help. I was in Home Depot recently, one outside of NYC. Though, they host a different class each week (free). I would recommend looking into that and if NYC home depots offer them too. "
The truth is that you aren’t the only one. Many many of us are. 
or have an entourage of half a dozen people to take care of him
Can anyone help me get a reservation at Dorsia? I want to take Paul Allen there. 
Why do you walk so slow? Get out of the way.
"I actually like Bloomberg and thought he should've run as an independent in 2016. I think he did a great job with NYC as mayor, and like every politician he had his pros and cons as the mayor. However, even though he might run against Pres. Trump (I'd love to see this debate); I'm not sure he'll beat him. Bloomberg's strengths are in capitalism and business. The economy is doing great. So I only see him targeting Pres. Trump's character more than anything.

I also doubt the progressive wing of the democratic party would accept him, or anyone short of Sanders, Warren or another progressive."
"Did a little Googling for you. CityMD looks like a good bet. They're open on weekends, have a few different locations, and have rapid HIV testing.

"I think they're distasteful, but to non-New Yorkers it probably feels like a *lifetime ago. Tons of users weren't even alive when it happened.

Not excusing their behavior. "
I wish the handkerchief never went out of fashion. I would carry one if it didn't make me look like a roaring 20s dandy
"I just quit after 7 years of working in an nyc public school. I couldn’t take it anymore. It took everything out of me - my sanity, my health, my body. It was never the kids - the kids were great. Dont get me wrong I DEFINITELY had many students throughout the years that were very difficult to handle but I never minded. It was the lack of support and honestly just the general sense of “anything that happens in the classroom is your fault and you have to deal with it” that drove me insane. Always felt like I was just asked to perform miracles NO ONE could perform. Also, I had seriously incompetent admin - actually heard one of the APs say she “bought” her admin degree meaning she paid for someone to do it for her. I had times in the past where a principal was so unfair to me even though I worked so hard I developed  an anxiety problem. In my experience, this has been the shittiest, most horrifying experience of my life and I feel bad for the kids that have to endure this broken system. I’m sorry if anyone thinks it’s discouraging but it’s just my truth. I wish I could go back and never choose this career path, I was so hopeful and excited and happy in the beginning and I’m so sad for what teaching has devolved into. "
"I sweat like a bastard down there, so what I've taken to doing is checking CityMapper for when my train will arrive and will just stay above ground until it says it'll arrive in 2 or 3 minutes."
Fuck that - I started bringing handkerchiefs back after I realized that I was spending a disproportionate part of my disposable income on paper towels.  Anyone who thinks I'm a dandy from the 20s can bite me.
"As a parent of a kid that succeeded in NYC public schools, thank you both for doing what you do.  Good teachers can have a weirdly positive impact (the converse may also be true).  Hang in there and see if you can find and help the rare kid that needs it.       "
You need a dressmaker/seamstress not a tailor.
I'm 30 and the zoo is super fun.  I love looking at monkeys and making faces at them.
"...but she does have a plan. It’s Andy Byford’s plan, same as Cuomo’s, and they both support congestion pricing to help pay for it. Difference is Cuomo wants NYC to pay for half, and Nixon wants to levy taxes on polluters and millionaires. This is not “absolutely no plan”, although whether it’s a good idea is a different story.
"
"About six months ago on my walk to work, probably around 36th and 8th or so, a guy asked if he could use my phone to look up an address because he was late for an interview. I asked for the address and looked it up for him, being careful to turn my body just enough to make a grab and run difficult. I had a strange feeling, and lo and behold, instead of running 'to his interview', he walked a block away to ask someone else to use their phone..."
"After you miss your train by 2 seconds and the next one is in 30 minutes, you never walk slow again. "
"Go to museums.  They often have free nights like the MOMA on Friday nights.  For NY state residents the Met is pay-what-you-wish.  Another museum I like a lot is the Museum of Moving Image which is all about the movies.  There are film screenings, cool exhibits like the one on Jim Henson, etc.  

The other thing I would suggest are the food events that are constantly going on every week.  Off the top of my head I’ve been to Coffee Con, Dessert Goals, and in October there is going to be a momo (Tibetan dumpling) crawl in Jackson Heights.

There is plenty to do in NYC that doesn’t involve getting wasted.  You just have to research."
"Everyone and their mom will be running in 2020.

I expect the first debate to have at least 20 participants. "
"You should take it. If people don't take it then it will never be culturally acceptable.

I work in finance and there are a lot of the same pressures you're alluding to, but we also recently adopted a paternity leave policy like you're describing. A few guys have taken it, which I think is great. I haven't but I definitely will. Keep in mind industries like ours are dealing with the tech firms attracting talent and they are definitely encouraging people (men and women) to take advantage.

Full disclosure I haven't done this yet, but will when I have kids in a couple of years."
"An impaired driver in an F150 drove over me, running a red light while I was on the crosswalk. I was hospitalised. It was the most painful experience I've ever had. Since then, I've become very aware of drivers running red lights with  impunity. 

It's incredibly dangerous violate this basic traffic rule in a densely used city. These drivers should be held to account. Is calling 911 the only way? If so, I've got to start doing it -"
Get one. NYC weather is unpredictable. It can be 60 in September and 80 in October.
I have said hello to him every day for over 10 years now. Everyone tries to ignore him now. He is that annoying.
Must be a degenerate because none of the posts in this thread seem as fun as hitting the bar. 
I'm a thousandaire from queens and I will gild two of your comments if you pay me ten dollars
I appreciate compassion for other people but OP doesn't have an obligation to commit his personal time to engaging and treating a random person he doesn't know who it isn't his business to affect. Im sure exchanging hellos and a light conversation will be perfectly okay but he shouldn't be required to do anything he doesnt feel comfortable doing.
I can’t even recognize them
"I'll gladly take someone who is fully rhetorically committed to M4A and MTA funding over someone who spent the entire debate coming up with excuses for why he shouldn't fund either. At least Nixon will make an attempt to figure it out however imperfectly, while Cuomo has publicly promised that neither of these major quality of life issues will be addressed by his administration."
