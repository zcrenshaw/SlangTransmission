"That's your mistake. Going for the ""cute girl"". If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life, don't make a pretty woman your wife.... From my personal point of view, get an ugly girl to marry you.

"That *is* gender neutral language. You cannot commit rape without penetration. Women could conceivably commit rape if they used a strap-on, but that basically never happens."

"nope.

if you don't want your goods blasted out to the internet, don't do it.  once its out there, its out there and theres no going back


people have to be held accountable for their own actions."
"Cool, random internet person. I'm definitely siding with you over a scientific study in a high impact journal for their field."
"No, they should be thrown, literally, into a prison, the cells of which only contain, a bed, a treadmill, and a hole in the wall. Everyday the fat person walks on the treadmill until they burn enough calories(determined by their BMI), at which point a guard will bring them a small healthy meal. This goes on until they lose enough weight and can fit through the hole. Once they crawl through the hole, there is another cell, identical to the last, but with a smaller hole."
okay
"

&gt;That's one of the reasons some people say they are egalitarian instead of favoring one gender over the other (aka feminism).

The only people who do that are morons who are too dumb or too scared go talk to a feminist face to face, and instead use Tumblr idiots as their canonical example of feminism."
Haven't seen a single answer that doesn't also pertain to trans girls with dicks.
This trans movement that has just decided to completely ignore genetics and anything else that doesn't fit into their argument. I'm not against transgender people in any way and most I've talked to completely agree with me that the fanatical left are taking some of this way too far.
SWEEEEEEEEET! COOOOOOOOOOL!
I dont get these emotions when watching films because I'm not a wetwipe
"Yea cos women always turn down men, you just insulted your own kind"
"So then what are you saying? Guns and cocaine should be legal because people will get them anyway? 

It just doesn't sound like a path forward to an intelligent civilization... Regulated drugs and small arms for defense are one thing, but there's no need to be shoveling assault rifles at disgruntled manchildren with malicious intent... It's just kinda fucked."

If you had to fight a guy to the death &amp; could only pick one weapon would you choose a knife or a gun?

"So your argument against left wing academic papers is, ""We covered ourselves in paint as a kid, you're an idiot, ORANGE MAN BAD.""?

That's a bold strategy, Cotton."
"Yeah, I got beat up a lot in middle school by Arab and Mid-East kids *constantly*. I grew up in Dearborn lol I'm not saying people *can't* have horrendous things happen to them because of the color of their skin, that's factually inaccurate. If you want to call that racism, of course do so, but I won't for the same reason I don't say ""raped"" in video games anymore-it demeans the intensity of the word. That's really, really shitty that happened to you if you're saying that from experience, but I implore folks to not use racism/reverse racism to supplant *generations* of murders, lynching, bombings, economic policy, secret experimentation, concentration camps etc. that folks of color have endured under white majority rule. You can get 'fired' from a job or 'fired' out of a cannon, are those two words identically the same with the same context? Sure they both mean ejected and both *really* really suck, but one is a little more intense than the other, you think?"
"Yeah, it's completely dependant on where you are and other context."
Problem is as soon as you land on them they become used and it's illegal to sell a used mattress

"i mean, youre at their house. i dont agree with it, and its shitty but it is their house. if its important to you then your husband needs to sack up."

Right... pedantic
He meant the conspiracy theory aka The Great Replacement. You can look it up on wikipedia.
"But you have to be super lazy to not make the effort. I've personally lived in foreign countries and did everything I could to learn the language including taking classes and studying books. There's zero excuse after you've been living in the country for five or more years.

Perhaps your parents would actually learn the language much faster if you weren't doing the hard stuff for them. Not perhaps, they absolutely would learn so much faster."
Really? Its not hard to believe at all and we all know that.
Vote for Trump.
I like being physically and emotionally strong. Women are too easily influenced by their hormones.

So many racist states in the US. The south is just a big ole racist party lol jk jk. That's way overkill.
"In that case, MasterAC should have said ""Collage roommate was brown and from the middle East or south Asia"".
The distinction is important. Islam is a voluntary belief system, which merits quite different treatment to race, which one is born with and cannot change."

"Nah, opposing mass immigration and growing diversity-related anti-white sentiment in European countries does not make me a ""nazi"", lol. It makes me a white person who can actually think a bit further than his nose is long; who can predict the future negative side effects immigration will have in store for indigenous Europeans."

Boy. With the amount of men responding to this like it's a regular occurrence for them is concerning.

Glorify Stalin and Assasinate trump
Unsurprising that the correct answer gets downvoted. Reddit is filled with native English speakers and therefore they butcher the language every chance they get.
how does 67 feel? you think about the reaper much?
It's easy to criticize an entire television production sitting on your ass. All you whiners are so annoying.
"Maybe perceive each individual as an individual?

"The didn't realy kill Maul, he came back in TCW,  Dooku was explored a bit more in the same way but he didn't die in episode 2 like EVERY ONE OF THE PREQUELS. And the big bad guy Palpatine couldn't basically die so who died in episode 2?"
"No, two packs is two packs. Are you stoopid?"
"So mods are incapable of being fooled and/or lying?

"Well her husband isn't a millionaire and there isn't a family, just her and her husband. I'm hoping for the best, expecting the worst."

They have no legal right to do so.
This is a little different from a typical dirty you’d make with a friend. The guy is talking how he’s *actually* grabbed women by the pussy.
"Why are you so concerned about Hong Kongers? Are you a descendant of one? Is your country currently free of problems that you can now put your attention on Hong Kong? Were you this concerned about protests when protests across the Arab world happened in 2011?

Why don't you work to improve the condition of the poor people in the city you're living in? Why Hong Kong of all places? There are people who desperately need more help, like the native Brazilians who are being forced out of their lands so the logging companies can step in and cut the forest. Do you want to support the Hong Kong protesters because you don't like China?"
These differentials are usually explained when you control for repeat offenses
"Awwwww fuck dude... I hope it works out for you man.. like no bullshit I really do ..Mine still tells me she loves me too but when pressured with an ultimatum she backed down because of how it would effect her family. I totally respected that, but also her husband is a multimillionaire and I’m not. I’d be a fool if didn’t think that played into her decision. Best of luck to ya, man."

"&gt;There are many different gang ""varieties"". Some would make a drug lord nervous. Some do community service. Some want to rule their neighborhood. Some just want to protect its residents. 

You can come down off your high horse any time. The context of the discussion, is OBVIOUSLY not inferring a group of friends who pick up trash, as defined as a gang. You're rather arrogant to infer it as well. (We are commenting on parent who goes on to describe an absolutely abominable act, caused by a person, who a) is likely still walking free, and b) has some very serious deeply rooted emotional problems to name a few.  For fuck sakes you white knitting prick) 

We are talking about street gangs. The ones who are all too well known to commit heinous crimes. And I don't give a flying fuck, if theyre robbing liquor stores for initiation, brawling a leader, etc. The VAST MAJORITY of VIOLENT GANGS in North America's, right of initiation, is murder. 

Gangs, IE, organized crime, really isn't that complex a societal problem. If you're a member of one of these groups, you have long established you dont want to be a contributing member of a functioning society, therefore you should be removed from society BEFORE you become a problem. 


Go white knight somewhere else dood. Gangs, and gangsters can rot in the worst places in hell."

You're a dumbass for like 6 different reasons in this story.
"Bullshit comment, this is just the show The OA."
"Gifts are not income in US. No tax to recipient. Lottery winner probably will owe estate tax at his or her death, and large gifts during your life use up how much you can die with before you owe tax. Unless tax laws change."
"No, the fact that it's horrifying and damaging doesn't disprove anything. Reality may actually be horrifying. But we don't need to point out how much damage it's doing to disprove or refute it; it's ridiculous on it's face."
"I know, too many Americans on reddit for irony or sarcasm"
"The main reason was because of bullying in schools my parents were never afraid of me being bullied they were afraid i would hurt a bully I’m the kind of person who doesn’t get mad easily but if I do you better be out of the way 

Also the fact that every week some is getting caught selling drugs and some of the things they teach (mainly evolution and things like that)"

"&gt;For real. Maintain your facial hair, clean your pores and shower every other day.

Realizing that you didn’t need to sex up the fat ugly girl and that you could’ve just jerked it and be done with it
"I fully understand what you are saying, and I feel a bit dirty that I always did this (recentlyish got dumped). But thinking about it, I realise that the only time we would ever have sex is if I initiated it having cuddled for 10ish minutes. It was impossible to tell beforehand or without making a little move so I basically did it every time we cuddled. She did mention it a few times that sometimes it annoyed her but upon reflection I don't really know what else I could have done. I did mention that I'd love it if she initiated sometimes but I also understand that there is no way to force yourself to want to have sex and it seemed like she never wanted to without me doing a bit of work beforehand. Idk. Any insight what I should've done differently?"
"That man ain't changed if they are bragging! Leave him asap before they get back into the habit!


One should only feel regret and guilty of their past mistakes so that it can push them to not doing it again."
"Lighten up, my dude."
"Um, no? I've lived by myself for two years. Great assumption making skills though."
"Asking women for advice on how to be a good bf? Bad idea? Just look at what they say they want, and they actually seem to want. Two totally. different things."
"Do you blame them tho? You essentially said that you are not planning to have offspring in their eyes...


Do remember it is our generation that is sympathetic the lgbtqa+, not theirs....but one thing is for sure, if someone tried to kill you, they would protect you."

"Black Panther sex pills. Shit lasts like 2-3 days. Turns me into the Semen Demon. Gf loves it too, especially when she gets a huge load and then I'm still hard and cumming again a few minutes later.  


inb4r/hailcorporate but yeah any of those sex pills will work I'm sure. I just specifically mentioned that one as I've tried others that gave me headaches or made my bp shoot up. But that one and maybe the Rhino ones are pretty clean, natural horny energy feeling."

"All girls are crazy, no need to segregate them."
Doesn’t change the fact that my ex father in law who is not allowed to buy firearms legally did in fact just walk into a gun show and buy 3 just by picking the booths that aren’t a retail business. It isn’t hard to bypass a background check.
"In the end, every relationship starts because someone was horny, its not love at first sight that will unconditionally last forever. Real love, as opposed to teenage infatuation, takes time to build. Now you might argue with this any way you like, but facts speak for themselves, there is a reason why in the more ""modern"" societies the divorce rate is almost 50%. Its too easy to walk out on marriage those day.

Romance is not dead, but romance is something you have when you meet a pretty young girl while on a vacation, don't confuse that with what happens 7 years later. 

One of my favorite examples is Arnold Schwarzenegger, his ex wife still looks good even in her 60s, and sure, as a high profile man he could've easily get a 20 year old floozy, many man are pigs like that. But despite having this hot wife, he cheated on her with something that looked like a botched abortion attempt at a back alley. Now why do you think out of all the choices he had, that's who he chose to have an affair with?"
