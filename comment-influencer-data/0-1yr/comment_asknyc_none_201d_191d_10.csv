Private garage in Brooklyn.
What’s the job? Does it come with a substantial increase in pay? Have you lived in NYC before? 
"a girl i was dating and i were waiting in line for the bathroom on the top floor (the one with the attendant). she goes in first then after she gets in the stall, she beckons me to come in with her. i reluctantly get in and she tells me to put my pants down so she can suck it. on paper this is a great scenario but i'm quietly freaking out about the attendant who i'm pretty sure saw me go in. after about 30 seconds i zip up and stagger my exit. attendant turns to me and says ""i saw that. if it happens again ima get you kicked out"". we enjoyed the rest of the night but i went elsewhere to pee lol"
"Consider that brokers typically take 15% of annual rent as a fee. You'll be forking over $3960 for their service. If you only intend to stay in the apartment for 1 year, that's $330 per month on top of the rent. If 2 years, that's $165 extra per month, and so on. Unless you plan to stay there for many years, it may be worth it to suck up a little bit of extra monthly rent."
good point! 
"He's still an asshole, though. "
"Realtors are always shocked that I cook regularly and need a kitchen that's not a **microwave precariously balanced** over a mini fridge.

"I think there's a cultural grey area of pointing out inconsiderate behavior versus pointing out illegal behavior. It's extremely rude to play music on the subway, but the person is technically not doing anything ""wrong"". On the other hand, there's more cultural contrast where taking up more than one seat is concerned. "
"I used to see it in Patel Bros. the one in hicksville growing up.

Perhaps call the one in jackson heights to see if they do. "
"Yea I was hoping that wouldn't be the case.

I can find Lindt chocolate no problem in the states, but the my understanding is that the recipe for the US-produced stuff is different from what's used in Europe. I've never had a better chocolate bar than Sprungli straight from the source."
He's in Florida! My husband actually by chance ran into him at his new restaurant owned by the same people who owned Morans when he was there on a work trip! It was crazy!
"The thing about NYC is the smallest, seemingly harmless person on the subway could be some maniac off their meds who has no problem fucking you up. I bring my earbuds EVERYWHERE and avoid situations like that. "
Currently yes
"When you say you didn’t leave the house, do you mean you didn’t leave the day of treatment, or you stuck around too much in the days and weeks after the treatment?"
Not appropriate. 
Mars come and visit me lol.
"It's funny that someone would hear ""your music is loud and disrupting the quiet on this train"" as ""I don't like your peoples' music."""
Is transferring to a different CUNY an option? There's a bunch in Manhattan that would probably give you a shorter commute.
"No but one time I picked up the guy's speakers and hurled them onto the tracks, where they got obliterated by a passing train.

...in my imagination."
"I've been living in eastern flushing for 9 years and I had no idea. Thanks for the info though, it might be useful to me if I ever need it."
I've sang along. I'm not a good singer...
"Alright, thanks for the advice. Will edit now!"
"I have said this before in a different thread, but I’m big on these situations. When I was younger I would be pretty hostile and yell at kids to turn their shitty music off but that never worked. But I did notice that when I say “please” “miss” or “sir” people tend to be nicer and look like they’re ashamed. Most of the times they agree and we both win."
"I’ve seen some nice places in Astoria posted directly by landlords on Facebook but that has gotten pretty crowded with brokers too. 

You might try Ridgewood as well. I personally love that area, lots of cool stuff going on. "
I wish I could. NYC renting has raised significantly. I need at least 2 bedroom apartment in a good area.
They're so great at blocking noise that they also block out things like emergency announcments and sounds of imminent danger. 
"This is why I'm confused. My movers supplied me with a COI naming the building management company as the beneficiaries, so I presumed that they would do the claiming. I'm not mentioned on the insurance documents."
I weighs think that's Rule 1.
So basically Chinatown amirite 
"Why would someone perform a service for less then the prevailing wage? And not advertise it? And only make themselves known on Reddit? Is Reddit a repository of cheaper goods and services?

Would you do your job for less pay?"
"They are going to try and upsell you on a million things. Eye shops like that are generally legitimate small businesses, and I feel for them in light of all the serious good online competition (Warby, etc.). But their business model is too reliant on bait-and-switch tactics that leave you feeling like your pocket has just been picked."
Not exactly: I had to fart really badly but held it in and crop dusted them on the way out 
"There are tons of factors that you should consider when making the decision on whether to buy or not, and these are not things that we would be in a position to decide for you. For example, can you find a house that you would like in a neighborhood you would want to live in long-term for $750k? Are you willing or ready to stay put in the same home for the next 5, 10, or more years? Are you willing to take on or hire someone to handle the added chores or responsibilities that come with owning your own home?

From a financial perspective, the incentive to buy a home is not what it used to be due to the changes in how much you can deduct on your taxes. There are all sorts of articles and videos online now that talk about whether or not it's still worth it to buy property. You should either do some research and run the numbers yourself or speak to a financial adviser.

Lastly, make sure you factor in any potential extra monthly costs that would come from owning your home, like having to pay real estate taxes, potentially HOA costs (not many *houses* in NYC have HOA costs, but it's something to keep in mind if you are looking in the suburbs), utilities that you haven't had to pay for in your previous apartments, etc."
"Arrest em, run em for the warrants they obviously have then fine them and take the speaker. They are like a ticking time bomb waiting to go off. "
Do you not like your friend or something? He’s gonna pay more in taxes and have a shitty commute because why? He should just live in LI with an easy drive to the LIRR and he can train it in for weekends. 
"I commute an hour and a half each way all within the city. I've done two hours each way before too. It's not worth it. It's never worth it. And for fucks sake friends don't let friends needlessly pay NYC taxes and car insurance rates when there's another alternative. 

Better solution, what's the closest LIRR line to you? Try to sell him on a place that's on that line. "
"I played my own music and pumped it with no headphones.  In retrospect, now there are two assholes"
"Function. Too many people think they'll be ok living in a 6th floor walkup with a leaky roof, bad plumbing, and quasi-functional appliances just because it's a deal in the West Village. Doesn't matter how cool the neighborhood or how convenient the subways - if your apartment isn't functional it's not going to be somewhere you want to come home to."
"No clue, but I'm curious as well. A friend of mine did it and said that he ended up having to pay an extra $200 for the glasses he wanted because he didn't like any of the cheaper frames. "
Happy to meet you in the city sometime and give you a handful of pairs of earbuds... Don't be so cynical.

"I'm sure your locksmith would let you know but just so you know when selecting, locks which require a key to unlock are illegal in apartment interiors. If you can unlock them by turning a knob, you're fine.  If you would need a key to get out in the event of a fire, it's a safety hazard.  Also your lease likely has a clause about providing a copy of the key to the super or building management.  It's important in the event of an emergency, like a burst pipe flooding the apartment below yours."
"Well I usually juno, or uber if I need a car. Aside from this I would look up garages in case I can't find street parking. In some cases I would just opt for garages because even though it might cost me more I'd rather pay a private business than have to ever deal with hostile traffic enforcement officers. I'm usually polite to them but even so each time they write a ticket they act as though they've busted a career criminal. "
"&gt; As a guy, I see TONS of women on OkC who just put ""Just ask"" as their only profile information.

I'm a straight woman, so we're not seeing the same profiles, but there are plenty of men who half-ass it, or don't bother to fill things in, and definitely several who put the ""just ask,"" but to me that's just an easy way to weed out lazy people whom I'd never be interested in anyway. 

I honestly see way more generic or lazy profiles on Hinge... it's even easier to half-ass it on there since there's really no such thing as a fully filled-out profile in the first place. I can count on one hand the amount of profiles I've seen where I actually feel like I have a sense of who the guy is, as opposed to OkCupid where at least there's an opportunity to write about yourself and who you're looking for, not to mention the questions themselves which can be pretty insightful. 

Also... maybe I'm not using Hinge right, but what do you mean that it forces you to have a conversation? Very rarely does someone actually make a comment, it's always ""so and so liked your photo."" Which, coupled with a generic, boring profile... next.

Tl;dr - I guess I see OkC and Hinge as so, so different... and maybe catering to a very different kind of person?... that I wasn't really following your point that Hinge is what OkC wants to be. I have a hard time seeing Hinge, Tinder, or Bumble as apps for people who care about factors other than looks. 

And yep - reprise the theme song and roll the credits! :)"
Check your dates with NYCFC home games. Season begins in March. They play at yankee stadium 
You couldn't be more wrong:  Bowery Ballroom is still the best venue on this planet.
"You are correct; technically they can tow you on the first ASP violation. Does it ever happen? Maybe. Does it happen often? No.

I think getting towed for a second ASP violation, especially if you’ve already paid the first ticket, is highly unlikely.

If anything, you might get booted, but even that is pretty unlikely. "
"Circle. Sometimes it takes an hour. It's the price you pay for driving. I commute to work, so I'm looking for parking daily. Sometimes I bite it and risk the ticket if I can't find a spot. "
"I can teach you for $20.

But also if you don’t trust reddit strangers, usually free programs are limited through schools and employers, (but a quick google search has shown me FDNY offers free courses: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/fdny/education/cpr/be-911-cpr-program.page). If you’re really self-motivated, you can get all the info a regular citizen needs about CPR on YouTube. I work as a paramedic and I can tell you you’ll probably fuck up a ton on your first cardiac arrest (still worth knowing though). It’s a skill that takes practice. And PSA: if you’re ever in a situation where someone doesn’t have a pulse, call 911 and the operator will talk you through CPR"
"yes, just don't do it"
"Oh, right you are. Sorry, confused!"
The Telltale Ring.
"I really like Wing Fat behind Newkirk Plaza. 60¢/lb. I don't drop off anything delicate, but casual clothes have been fine for the year I've been going. And for linens, towels, etc that take a long time to dry it's actually cost-effective for me to drop off instead of washing myself. Very crowded usually, but the price is good, it's open late and Lisa the owner is very nice and extremely hard working."
"No certificate for this one but it is totally free, great for non medical personnel and easy to remember and refreshis the YouTube video of [Ken Jeong teaching hands only CPR](https://youtu.be/n5hP4DIBCEE)

Anything that would produce a certificate worth anything (like Red Cross or AHA) would require payment and typically real classroom instruction and practice."
I’ve been and I’m obsessed 
"I personally think 1 week is enough time. If you hustle and schedule lots of showings before you arrive (and come prepared with all the paperwork), you can see many many places in that timeframe. The exception is if you're especially picky and have a long list of ""must-haves."""
Nope. I hated their sound system so much so I never went back. Good to hear they redid it.
Ya I want to avoid roommates. But my budget is 2500-2700 so hopefully I should be good for finding something.
Sell your car.
"I know! Where I came from, taxes are automatically filed by our employer. And unless you have other sources of income, you don’t have to do anything else. US taxes, plus living in this city, are a whole new deal for us.
Have a good one, mister/miss."
"Same. We got married upstate, had a three day weekend vacation with the wedding party (all of our closest friends basically), which ended up being three house parties at our awesome Air B&amp;B plus the wedding. We probably spent 20k total (I mean everything from dress to venue to food to weekend lodging) when all was said and done. I'd do it over again in a heart beat.

The venue in the city would have been 20k alone. "
Oh I’m excited to hear what you think! I’ve been dying to try that private room. It looks so elegant!!
