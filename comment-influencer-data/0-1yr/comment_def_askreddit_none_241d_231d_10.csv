"In all honesty, that's a cool move for a dad. I bet he was ready to beat your ass for touching his kid inappropriately. I admire that, but I def would have been peeing my pants in that scenario. Thank god he was reasonable, dude."
"Bout 10 years ago I was kinda seeing this girl I knew for quite awhile before that. Well, she calls me at about 3am and she's crying and tells me that I need to come get her because she was out partying and ended up at a random house and is scared of the guys there. Well she finds out the address where she is at from her friend and I get my ass up and drive to the house to get her. I get out of my truck and start walking to the front door when she comes running out of the house and tells me to get back in my truck. Kinda still tired and confused, I didn't really budge. Not 5 seconds later, a dude comes strutting out the door with a shotgun and it's pointed right at my face. Kinda stand there in shock for a couple seconds and then his friend, who is also my friend, comes running out telling the gun wielding guy that I'm ok and that I'm not a cop. Gun gets lowered and I proceed to get into my truck and leave. On the way home, girl tells me that the shotgun guy thought she called the cops and he wasn't having any of it. She said that he was def going to shoot me once he saw me pull up and that she ran out to warn me. So yeah, nearly got shot in the face by a meth-ed out mad man lol"
That story is told on day 1 of every EMT class in the US if not the world! Def an urban legend. 
"You would def need some lows around electioneering. One of the best thing about the old Canadian system, where we didn’t have standard terms and elections were triggered, was that there was only ever a number of weeks notice so you would get these short blasts of election adverts compared to the “basketball-like” US elections with 9+ months of drama that don’t matter and then everything goes crazy in the last moments. "
"So just studied this, it def wasn’t WAY common. It was the upper class. Also, he said they had slaves until 1890. That’s at least 20 years when it was *not* common to have slaves "
