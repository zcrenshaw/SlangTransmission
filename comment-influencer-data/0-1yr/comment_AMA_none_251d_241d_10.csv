Im a villain. (Man)
How has your romantic / sex life changed throughout the journey? 
I‚Äôm not sure but if they do that‚Äôs adorable. 
Thank you! üòÅ
"I do, actually.   
And I'm pretty sure I'm more conscience than you. Charities bro :)  
"
do you feel any sexual arousal by dressing up as a f
Is it true that Walmart has employees on the floor searching for suspicious people?
"True, If you got credit card fraud , its likely that you will only lose 10% of the total amount.  
"
"Haha I feel a bit, but after a jog I'm completely fine! üòÅ I usually just jog, browse reddit, watch funny videos, clean around the house, or catch up on a project. Just normal day stuff hahaha



Netflix is a big one hahaha"
"No, not in any way, i just do it for fun and cause it's comfortable for me"
Good bot
I did 92 hours and almost died man. Shit sucks I feel bad for you. 
Where you listening to music or texting when it happened?
"Is it as bitchy as it is made out to be?

Are drugs a full on thing?

Describe the most over the top / outrageous person or event you have encountered?"
Fuck. You.
Yes..!
How were you in a situation where you got in the train‚Äôs path to begin with? Glad you‚Äôre alright.  
What's your favorite food? Also what are you studying in school? And lastly what do you want to do for a job?
"How do you manage to not fall asleep? You said Netflix is big but if I would watch Netflix after 24hours of now sleep, I would sleep in the first minute."
"Since it is only software, you could make a free version for the poor schools, so it Will only detect rifles and not pistols? U know, cus fuck the poor"
Oh that's priceless. Nice job. 
Yeah they offered me it. Im a painter and decorater by trade. To be honest i would probably do a better job with a roller. Im fucking terrible at nails
My husband is military and this is our FIRST duty station. He's been out here almost 7 months already.
Did you find oil there?
"I have to go on clear liquids every so often, and I have a pretty standard regimen. I‚Äôm always thirsty, and would constantly guzzle water if I didn‚Äôt pay attention to my intake, so I try to drink a Gatorade for every big thermos of water. Besides Gatorade and water, it‚Äôs pretty much just Jello, Italian Ice, and Sprite to settle nausea. 

Sometimes I‚Äôll want something savory, and I‚Äôll have some chicken broth, but usually I try to stick with cold  stuff because it seems to ease some of my GI pain. "
You have to sea in from my perspective...
The last time he went to a doctor was before I met him and he only went because he was in and out of consciousness due to an accident :(
"Not well. So far I can say hello, goodbye, and thank you. I have been studying the alphabet so I can sound out the words they make. From there I get lost lol I have notecards of phrases, but the transition of English to Hangul is difficult."
"That makes 0 sense to me. Im spreading awareness about transracials, but people are upset because theres another trans in town taking some spot like from transgenders? Where the compassion?"
Its a great way to get the word out about my painting. They try teach me as best they can but i mostly try a learn from watching them and avoiding any of the tricky bits. Honestly never thought I would end up doing this and I'm still not that sure why I took the job
How are you today?
"If you actually thought that you were a different race I would tell you to seek help, because there‚Äôs probably some underlying problem you have that causes you to think this way. But it is *painfully* obvious that you don‚Äôt actually think this about yourself and you‚Äôre trolling r/AMA and r/AskReddit. I hope you find whatever attention or acknowledgement you need irl and that you stop bugging the rest of us."
"Thanks :) I know my life right now is not bad. And I hate that I have to be like this even though I have everything I always wanted. But If you look at life this  ""someone is always having it worse"" way you will get stuck in infinite loop. I am trying to get my life together I know I am privilaged."
Reported.
Such a fishy thought...
"How did you find out this was a thing, or that you had it?"
"Everyone covered this for me. They are a high target, especially among men/ boys, and low income mom's trying to get stuff for their kids Christmas.

&amp;#x200B;

Something else in the store may be more expensive, but less desirable. Most people steal things they want. Very few steal things to resell them online.

&amp;#x200B;

Older games get less love and usually not locked up or cased. Want to know why? It's sort of a marketing trick. The locked games make you feel they are the good games; the games you should spend your money on. Generally more expensive as well. If a parent has no idea what game to get their kids, it's usually a safe bet to get a game in a case. Those are deemed desireable"
"Most will be suprised but I will finally not have to lie about why I am not attending some parties and stuff. 

I am lookin into it. My insurance doesn't cover it so I need to make some more money. My insurance covers my pills so thats something for now!"
Yes I hope to make a full recovery! My ensurance doesn't cover the theraphy so I need a more stable job then I will get my treatment!
What city/state you in?
"WOW! My sister has that, apparently a fair number of autistic folks like her do, had no clue there was a name for it. The whole ""thinking in pictures"" books and movie which make it seem like all autistic people only think in pictures really bothered her because she can't visualize them at all. "
Epic troll 10/10
Not really or not for me at least. During vetting I am upfront that it is not a sexual or romantic relationship. Friendship doesn‚Äôt sound right but the best word I can think of.
I guess I can say it is intimate but not sexual.
"I was 18. 

I actually had to kind do a runaway mission with my boyfriend to go seek help when I finally turned 18, because my parents were abusive and neglective and told me every day I was just acting out for attention. My mother actually told me once she had ‚Äúcracked‚Äù my code and figured out that I just use ‚Äúanxiety attacks‚Äù to freak out when I don‚Äôt get what I want. They actually continued to try and control my life after I turned 18 and I ran away. Luckily I have a support system in my boyfriend and his family, otherwise I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd be alive today. 

It took me another six months to actually be treated. At this point I was living in the dorms at school and finally away from my parents, but still not in a good place. I attempted suicide, got caught by campus police, and was put in a mental hospital where I got my first meds. Since getting out, I‚Äôve gotten a psychiatrist who oversees my meds (Sertraline/Zoloft and Vistaril to keep me asleep when I have nightmares) and a therapist for ERP. 

I‚Äôm so thankful to finally be getting treatment for something I‚Äôve battled since childhood. It‚Äôs been a long time coming. "
Yes definitely
Have you listened to Acid Rap whilst on acid?
Never tried them in Austin. 
It‚Äôs the raddest color of them all!
That‚Äôs awesome. Can you make out how a person would look like?
"The question was something like ""Are cashiers/greeters supposed to stop shoplifters?"" I wonder why that redditor deleted such an innocuous question? "
I wish ‚ÄúI‚Äù had his resources just to buy brand name cereal. 
"Synesthesia affects everyone differently; some people see sounds as color, I see words and numbers as colors. The word ‚Äòsound‚Äô is a desaturated yellow-green. The word ‚Äòdreaming‚Äô is a deep blue-purple. "
"I wish I could poison all food supply, specially cereal. I would be fun to observe children bleeding from their eyes."
"Are we talking about the ghosts of dead people or are we talking about something more like angels and demons? Because I'm wanting to know about the ghosts of dead people and whether they can haunt houses. You see, I aspire some day to be able to haunt houses. It's always been a hope of mine though I'm skeptical that it will ever happen."
I'm talking about ghosts of dead people. They definitely exist and it's most likely that your mind is also surrounded with them. That's what the illuminati are on about. They know how the spirit world works and is why many of the artists willingly sacrifice themselves. To help others in need spiritually
What? Huh? Oh yeah that was funny. 
"Well I mainly play zombies. All guns have a different sound, and shooting zombies is as simple as making sure they're centered in the stereo field."
I've never been one to care about health
I didn't get to the point where I have the answers but I'd bet on that. If it's not the illuminati it's a satanist organisation. One of them is trying to open up our third eye. What's weird is that there are some suspicios celebrity deaths. I think there's more than one organisation in hollywood that are at each other's throats but again I don't know. If you want I can share some songs that could make sense if you listen to them after each other
"That's super awesome. Kudos on being able to adapt to something like that in so many different things! Glad to see there's not just a whole lot of nothing in my future when my other eye decides to go. High-five man, you're awesome!"
"Like everything else, it just depends. Intro roles in the US will be in the $25k - $30k range but that will vary based on the company. Expect commission to factor heavily into this though. My first role as an agent worked well for me and I was making low six figures in my mid 20's.

YMMV though."
Why is everyone being rude?
"""WHY GOD WHY"""
"Wow! That sounds really rough, but amazingly you've achieved so much. You're doing very well."
"Well no, I‚Äôm not dead. I‚Äôm not posting this from my grave. 

I mean I have family that has been murdered. I have not had someone attempt to murder me, just that I have lived through family being murdered."
Who is your favorite superhero?
And Congress failed to do their job by not extending the ban on selling semi-automatic guns. 
"Haha enjoy that warm feeling. 

Can I have $15 for some pizza?

"Hey there,

A lot of my very, very close friends are South African. I only left when I was young because my mother decided it was the right course of action.

Please don't lose hope. South Africa needs talented and hard working people like you. Every time I go back to South Africa, I fall in love with the beautiful country again, and to me, it will always feel like home :-)"
"Lmao @ your self conversing convo.

Hope for a speedy recovery. What strain?"
Instead of poisoning me you want to give me pneumonia? Genius! You‚Äôre a genius evil mastermind! Except no. I‚Äôm not leaving my house today. 
"I see people posting about this person having mental issues.  WRONG!!!  Unless you have a psych degree, stfu.  You people have no idea what is really going on out there and it is wrong to call someone crazy unless you are qualified to do so.  My gang stalking has been proven so yes...  people it really does exist and there really are sick people out there that do this crap.    
So get over yourselves and try to help this person and others get out of the grips of these sick stalking weirdos instead of playing like you're a shrink and your diagnoses really counts.  If you think your diagnoses counts then...  who is the crazy one?  YOU ARE!"
It's been about five years. 
"Phenomenal journey you've overcome Ross, I'm blown away. 

You truly are an inspiration.   


If I could ask, what was the follow up after the incident? I can't even fathom what it would have been like for both of you.   


&amp;#x200B;"
"*Sigh*
Here we go again

* Semi-Automatics as a whole have never been banned or highly restricted in the United States. I Believe you are trying to refer to the Assault Weapons Ban of 1996, which did not ban Semi-Automatics, but did ban the sale of Semi-Autos with certain **cosmetic** features. It expired ten years later, in part due to the fact that it was found to be ineffective.
* There's a decent chance you don't actually know what a Semi-Auto is. Semi-Auto means that if you pull and hold the trigger, it will only fire one round and will not fire again unless you release and pull the trigger again. A large number of rifles and shotguns function like this, and the overwhelming majority of handguns fall under this category, including most revolvers. What you are likely thinking about is Automatic Weapons, which are regulated by the National Firearms Act of 1934 to the point that it is entirely impractical for a criminal to get one through legal routes, and they are relatively scarce on the black market due to how much it costs to get one in the first place.
* In 2013, more people were murdered by blunt objects (Fists, bricks, Hammers) than rifles. The majority of gun homicides are committed by use of handgun.

In summary, I severely doubt you have done your home work on this issue. America's gun laws are already ridiculous in what they restrict (There are things that are banned because somebody forgot to take that part out of the final draft of the bill, the ATF has ruled that a shoestring is a machine gun, certain foreign guns that would otherwise be legal can't be sold to civilians, etc) and you are making claims based off of sensationalism, supporting measures that simply  give the impression of politicians  making change when in reality they are doing nothing to stop crime, just hurt law abiding Americans."
"That‚Äôs actually what my family said and it was one of my concerns. It is possible that it will hinder my future relationships, just like other surgeries have hindered some already. Example I can only be with women because I had so much stuff done with my digestive system that I would only ever be a giver and I don‚Äôt like that. So yep. 

The genes running in my family is shit. My mom passed away in her early 30‚Äôs, I would die in my 30-40‚Äôs as well if I didn‚Äôt get surgeries. My surgeries destroyed me as a person, I had them right after high school and it was like an insane horror movie for an entire year.  If I had had a child there‚Äôs 50% chance they would have my gene in that specific category and I would probably go into deep depression knowing I did that to them. 

So, long story short: yes, but I would rather adopt a child that be selfish and make one just to call it biologically mine and then give it a life of hell. "

"I basically have no social life. Sure, I text ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and randomly post to social media but I can‚Äôt remember the last time I actually spent time with someone other than my child. 

Job wise. I would love to have a paying job but for right now, financially, it‚Äôs not really an option. Day care is stupid expensive where I live. Maybe when my child enters school...not sure what job I would even like though. "
"What was your initial thoughts when you realized you were blind? How did you find out? Did you think you were just in a dark room or did someone explain it to you?

You not only lost your sight, but your family members as well and I can‚Äôt imagine how overwhelming it all was. I feel really thankful that you are giving us an opportunity to ask you questions. Thank you "

"I don't think I will hurt my future pursuits, but I think I'm going to just focus on my work and dream for a while until I think I'm ready to go back into the dating scene. 

To avoid it in the future, and if I can afford it, I'll take some dating courses or buy a few dating advice books just to make sure it doesn't happen again. I've always felt unfairly handicapped in the world of social interactions, so becoming good with socializing would really give me some peace inside.

No, but I do live two hours away from them. Maybe I'll just move to another state (US) altogether. I'm not sure if I can ever go back to the town they live in, it might do more emotional damage than I can handle.

I'm glad you didn't end up wasting six years of your life like I did. You were a whole lot smarter than I was.  In my ""adventure"" this person blocked me several times on social media, but I was to dumb and distracted by my emotions to really take a hint so I kept pushing.

"My #1 subtype is magical thinking, a subtype that not a lot of people actually know about. Basically think superstition on steroids. Most people with OCD fixate on the consequences and what ifs of their actions, but magical thinking takes it to the max e.g. For tests at school if I don‚Äôt follow my ritual of flicking my light switch off a number of times, locking and checking my door, not stepping on cracks on the way to class, throwing a piece of gum in my mouth as soon as I get my test, and having two pencils, I will fail. Also, a test number 3 is good luck, and no matter what, if there is a version 5 and I get it, bad luck. 
Multiply this times all the other daily tasks in life and it gets quite exhausting. I once heard a story from a fellow magical thinking sufferer about how she used to sleep on a box of cheez-its because it would make her pretty. Doesn‚Äôt sound rational in the slightest, but OCD can sure be convincing. 

#2 is responsibility and harm, which sort of go hand in hand for me. I don‚Äôt want to be around knives, scissors, or anything sharp because I‚Äôm afraid I will harm someone. I am also deathly afraid of causing a car accident and killing someone. I don‚Äôt have contamination OCD in the way that I am afraid I will het sick, but I‚Äôm afraid that I will ‚Äúinfect‚Äù others, also a part of responsibility OCD. I try not to share pens, drinks, etc. and I stray away from food at parties unless there‚Äôs toothpicks or I can guarantee I won‚Äôt touch anything that doesn‚Äôt make it on my plate. 

As for compulsions, I do a lot of rituals (goes hand in hand with magical thinking). 3 and 9 are my ‚Äúlucky‚Äù numbers and I do things in groups of 3 or 9 whenever possible. I count the number of steps I take, the number of times I gulp when drinking, etc. I also have avoidance behaviors obviously for my harm and responsibility-O. "

---------|----------|----------|
So how do you judge depth when in traffic (or elsewhere)? Are there any methods you can use to figure out the distance of a static object (that you may not know the actual size of) without directly relying on binocular depth perception? Would it help for you to slightly move your head or shake it to see how different objects at different distances move relative to each other?|My main rule is: If I'm unsure, I keep my distance and approach slowly.  I always think objects are closer than they actually are, which is something I am very aware of. That usually makes me slow down way earlier than others if I'm gonna make a turn. I look around for any points of reference which I can use the next time I approach the turn. If I notice I slowed down way too early, I'll simply keep that in mind for the next time I approach the same turn. I'll just slow down and brake a bit later than before.  I definitely need to know how large objects are around me if I'm gonna park the car in front of something. ""Oh, now I can see this much of that particular object through the windshield, now I'm really close."". If I'm unsure I walk in front of the car to check how close I am. Bright lights help a lot while backing up because it's easier to tell how close I am just by looking at the light. Shadows help a lot too. It's a lot trickier in a truck, so sometimes backing up is a bit more time-consuming for me. I'd rather take my time than accidentally hit something.  I prefer vehicles with higher sitting positions, large windows, large side mirrors, and hoods that don't stretch too far out in the front. I drive a 2001 Honda CR-V and I think it suits me perfectly. I ideally want to see a bit of the front of the car cause it makes it a lot easier to tell how close I am to objects. The trucks we drive are COE (cab-over-engine) and usually have a mirror which lets you see what's right in front of you. I love it.  I have to move my head back and forth sometimes since my brain refuses to pick up my right eye's image. It can be a bit annoying, but it's all I know. If I'm too tired, my brain switches between the left and right eye which results in double vision. I don't really know any other methods to make it easier. It happens so naturally so it's pretty hard to fully think about it.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/abr4vi/im_a_trucker_with_no_depth_perception_ama/ed2mtbe/)
I thought all truck drivers had no idea of what's happening around them|Lol, I'm definitely not like that. I follow all traffic rules (I do speed on highways but never in cities nor residential areas) and I ALWAYS use my turn signal. I keep my distance, I never tailgate and I'm a very defensive driver.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/abr4vi/im_a_trucker_with_no_depth_perception_ama/ed2enpk/)
Does your employer know about your condition?|No, but I'm going to inform him about it very soon due to a upcoming surgery to get my eye fixed. I probably won't develop a depth perception but at least I won't have to worry about double-vision again.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/abr4vi/im_a_trucker_with_no_depth_perception_ama/ed2xnn5/)
Is this different to having a lazy eye at all? I have a lazy eye (had corrective surgery when I was young) and I can‚Äôt go to 3D movies and I hate stairs.|They're related. Strabismus can be the cause of a lazy eye. My right eye is a bit worse than the other one. Colors are less saturated, but everything is also *a lot* brighter so I can't go outside without sunglasses during daytime. If I don't wear my sunglasses I can't open my right eye at all, which in return must put a lot of strain on my left eye since it always makes me extremely tired. I hate stairs, especially when going down. I actually noticed 2 days ago that I can see depth while watching 3D movies. I have absolutely no clue why, though. It was pretty mind-blowing to realize what I've been missing out. It did give me quite the headache so I couldn't watch it for very long.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/abr4vi/im_a_trucker_with_no_depth_perception_ama/ed2k7mq/)
How do you manage merging lanes? Do you have to look in the mirror or is that also an issue?|I check my mirrors all the time. Merging can be a bit scary, and I usually avoid it if I can, but I haven't gotten into any accidents so far. I usually know I can merge if I can see the headlights of the car in my rearview mirror. It's a bit harder in a truck. It's easier at night since the lights on the trailer light up the ground and tells me how close I am to whoever's behind me.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/abr4vi/im_a_trucker_with_no_depth_perception_ama/ed2na60/)
Ever been in any accidents or near accidents due to your eyes?|None at all, which still surprises me. The only ""accident"" I've gotten into was caused by a very bad wheel bearing during a snowstorm. Driving without sunglasses would increase the risks of me getting into an accident because my eyes are incredibly sensitive to light. It either makes me almost blind or gives me double-vision. I don't really like either of them. I refuse to drive without them if I feel like it's too bright outside.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/abr4vi/im_a_trucker_with_no_depth_perception_ama/ed2q388/)
How old were you before you realised that most people didn't see the world in the same way as you do?  Also, how often do people misunderstand your eye condition, and raise concerns about it on the basis that it's different from their own?  (I have a very similar condition.)|I think I was 18 when I fully realized what it was. I noticed back when I was 11 or 12 that I only saw the image from my left eye and not my right eye. I also remember being very sensitive to bright lights, colors being less saturated, and everything just looked more bright. I didn't think much of it. It didn't cause any major issues. The light sensitivity was the only issue I had. I can barely keep my right eye open when it's sunny so I always have it closed when I'm outside.  I realized how bad it was when I was getting my forklift certificate. It was during a week when I didn't get any sleep at all and I had constant double-vision. I had to drive zig-zag between a bunch of traffic cones that were right in front of the forklift but I could not see them at all. My vision was all over the place. I told my teacher I had to stay home so I could get some sleep because I was a danger to everyone around me when I was driving.  It became even more apparent when I began my driving lessons (regular driver's license). I had severe difficulties with learning how to reverse while parking because I had no idea how to judge how much I could reverse before hitting something. I couldn't tell how close I were to other cars. The car I drove did have a backup camera which helped a ton, but I refused to keep using it as soon as I learned how to reverse. I didn't want to fully rely on it. I also noticed when I was tired the eye my brain wanted to use switched back and forth while focusing on curves. It was like the entire goddamn road was moving. It was exhausting. That's when I realized I had to use sunglasses pretty much all the time when I'm driving during the day.  Everyone I've mentioned it to think it seems bizarre. They find it very hard to understand how I can drive like this. Trying to explain to people how I percieve the world makes them look like huge question marks. I'm known to be a very safe driver, and that makes them more confused but it relaxes them too, I guess. I might ask passengers to help if I can't see how close I am to the car next to me, but that's about it.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/abr4vi/im_a_trucker_with_no_depth_perception_ama/ed2y8w7/)
Sorry to hear about your vision impairment, but are lot lizards a myth or do they really exist?|Well, some ""people"" put pineapple on pizza. I hope this answers your question.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/abr4vi/im_a_trucker_with_no_depth_perception_ama/ed3s9ht/)
Stick or automatic?|Stick when driving my car. I enjoy having more control and I just think it's way more fun. Especially in fun beaters. My dream car (First gen Lexus LS400) is auto, though. They're nicer for just cruising around. It's also kinda nice to simply press down the gas and instantly accelerate without doing anything else. It's pretty relaxing.   For trucks, I'd say auto simply because I'm not very experienced with driving manual trucks. The only manual trucks I got to drive in trucking school had transmissions that barely even worked. They had been abused. Badly.  I do like the idea of learning how to float through gears, though. Would be pretty damn cool.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/abr4vi/im_a_trucker_with_no_depth_perception_ama/ed2md8j/)
Are you married|Nope. I'm single|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/abr4vi/im_a_trucker_with_no_depth_perception_ama/ed3696z/)
Was it hard to find the job with such diagnosis?|Not at all. I got the job a few days before getting my license. Getting a job as a truck driver isn't hard at all.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/abr4vi/im_a_trucker_with_no_depth_perception_ama/ed3lckl/)

Yes 
Sounds good! I‚Äôll have to check that out. I don‚Äôt believe they have it at Panera. 
I don‚Äôt know what that means
Same here mate
"I remember having both when I was a kid, maybe 4ish then again at 7 or 9 ish but had an ‚Äúundecended testicle‚Äù removed around 11 so I‚Äôm guessing an injury.

I actually bust huge loads and have been told I have about 1.25-1.5x the testosterone of an average person so everything is working?"
"Why? there are several advantages. Psychedelics in particular can help you discover yourself and understand why you haven‚Äôt had a girlfriend.

Just a suggestion: maybe ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give or take shit‚Äù? What do you think?
Understandable 
I'll believe the advantages and stuff. I don't feel the need to take that stuff
