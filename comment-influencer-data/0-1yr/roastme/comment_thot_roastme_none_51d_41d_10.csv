"Talking about your eyebrows would be too easy. No instead let's focus on your crippling self-esteem. It's very obvious that you wanted to be that ""pretty"" girl who couldn't be roasted on this sub, but your pretentious hopeful self ought to keep dreaming because you're just another dumb basic bitch that is still full of flaws and insecurities. I'm surprised your boyfriend hasn't even thought about dumping you just for the sheer fact that you're such an attention seeking whiny wannabe artist. At this point your life choices are leading you to be the cheap whores I've seen on Van Buren street, or working McDonalds where you'll achieve an ungodly amount of acne that not even your foundation and conclear could hide. Let's be honest though, your insecurities will eat you up and you'll want to be desired once your boyfriend realizes you're a soft 4 personality and looks wise, and want something better, with a more successful future, so you'll probably turn to every other e-thot and sell nudes to horny incels because that's the only men you'll attract and when you hit rock bottom full of despair and jealousy for the prettier girls with amazing boyfriends, you succumb to that less than desirable neck beard who's fat and sweaty and just in your league. With his less than charming personality and your self loathing, you'll be sitting there wondering where it all went wrong. Something tells me I'm right too if you aren't happy enough to smile in your photos, and that no one ever sees it, or they do, but you just crave more attention. Does your boyfriend know that these fat assholes are in your DMs drooling over you? Where you pretend that you're disgusted by their misogyny, and their lack of personal hygiene, or does he just not care enough because he's banging your hotter best friend behind your back. Either way, you're fucked, just not by him."
