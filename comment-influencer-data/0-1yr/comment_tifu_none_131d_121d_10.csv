Happy Mother‚Äôs day ‚ô°
"This is quite possibly the most selfish shit I‚Äôve ever read. She hooks up with her own friend, without asking you if it‚Äôs okay, then proceeds to literally tell you it‚Äôs okay for you to join, then breaks up with you for it. 

Forget her, dude."
"""I knew he was actually French because accent was way better than mine""

Or hes just been in this game longer than you can imagine."
Had a girlfriend who made out with a girl at a party that I wasn‚Äôt at. The girl was bi/lesbian. I had to remind her that that was still cheating...
"Now you‚Äôre an orgy guy, you need to get new friends, orgy friends."
"&gt; Never going back.

No, keep going."
"Or call the friend, she didn‚Äôt seem to mind at all üòâ"
Plot twist: OP was legit testing the waters and this is his cover.
"Dude, finding this diary is the BEST thing that could have happened in this relationship! Run for your life!"
"Instead of telling them to call you when they need something, ask them if they wouldn't mind giving you a quick call every few days to say hi. Tell them you love to hear from them, and in their minds, it's not a bother, but rather a task which can help give them something to do.

I know, it sounds mean giving a simple job to elderly people, but they can make it part of their routine and it can hopefully make them feel useful, even in a small way."
I‚Äôm a dentist...people have very ‚Äúcurious‚Äù tongues and I can only imagine that would be worsened by grape flavored gloves. I think your dentist needs to have a sense of humor. The days get boring without patients like you.
Did you stay after class!?!?
double standard is fine as long as it benefits me.
"People act super weird when they are in the dental chair. The anxiety doesn‚Äôt help matters. I‚Äôve had my fingers licked and sucked by accident 100 times because the patient thought it was the suction tip. He probably forgot about the interaction shortly afterwards. Don‚Äôt sweat it.

"Only way you'll get the teasing to stop is to assert dominance. Next time relatives start teasing, say that you'll fuck them next. Also you can say you wish to keep the bloodline pure. Fucking mudbloods smh."
"Next time, I'll bite him."
"That threesome was probably a foursome, there had to be a forth to take the picture. 

Happy Mother's day"
Gotta end it.
She knew
Burn everything start a new life but this time be German
I‚Äôm sorry you saw your step dad with hair.
This is why he drinks.
"Bro Code: If a Bro is showing you a picture on his phone, DO NOT swipe."
"&gt;we decided to never reveal this major cock-up to a soul

&gt;she immediately tells her dad

What the fuck Isla"
"You didn‚Äôt fu. She was having fun with her friend, invited you in and when you asked she said yes only to change her mind.

According to your description of event, you did nothing wrong; she is unable to face the fact that she agreed to it and instead of acknowledging that she wasn‚Äôt ok with it after all, take the blame, talk about like an adult either during or after, she blames you for going through with it.

I understand you love her, try to have an adult conversation and remove all emotions from the discussion. If she blames you, move on."
"Dude your mom's just happy nothing it's seriously wrong. That being said, expect this to come up at your wedding."
Congratulations! Probably the most ethical and understandable possible way to miss the birth of your child.
"&gt;It would actually play on my mind so badly that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep if I didn‚Äôt open them, so I must open and read EVERY GODDAMN COMMENT.

It would be a shame if this post were to reach the front page too. ;)"
"I think the funniest part is the comment chain of your slow, but inevitable,  realisation."
"""The next day when I woke up I realised the best thing I could do (as an  Englishman) was just live with the lie for the rest of my short stay in  this house""

That‚Äôs your moms fault lol
Dude wtf... blame her not yourself.  Don't get back with her
"I asked my GF what she wanted for Christmas and she sent me a pic of a diamond ring she liked. I gave it to her and now it turns out, we're engaged! I'm a schmuck. I thought it was a christmas gift."
"Sooo how did you guys meet!?  Well, I was all hopped up on goofball gas just kicked back in his chair and licking his purple fingers."
This is the move
"Well actually yes everyone in France has been pretending to understand and speak french for the past 1000 years, please send help"
"I'm sorry, that sounds like a rough situation. 

Even though 2nd cousins are sometimes called ""kissing cousins"" due to the ability to legally marry, its still a bad situation to find yourself in.

Mad respect for breaking it off quietly, too."
"""I'll keep it short for you peeps""

No pun intended there, huh?"
What was dinner like? Did you guys actually stay and have a meal?
"My fiance did this. His graduation is tomorrow but he told his mom today and her flight is leaving before his ceremony tomorrow.

We found the mistake because I asked him to look up the time so I could tell my mom. He pulled it up and when I told my mom it was Sunday, he looked at me like I was crazy. Apparently 5 emails and pulling it up twice want enough for him.

I'm writing this while waiting for my name to get called in my own graduation."
"I mean, are both of y'all single? Cuz there's worse ways to meet someone"
Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy?  It changes everything.  You have to dress different.  You have to act different.  You have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and you need a new bedspread and new curtains. You have to get thick carpeting and weirdo lighting...
"This isn't just bro code, it's just code. Showing somebody a picture on your phone isnt permission to look at \*all\* their pictures."
The real question is. Who took the pictures?
working up the baby's tolerance to spice. Shit happens... now you know... won't do that again.
Sorry doc but 'cha gassed me.  Wild card!
"so it's okay for her to "" making out and grabbing "" with her friend (and I assume that shouldn't bother you), but not okay for you. Interesting."
I come from a country where parents would be delighted at this revelation!
If you're 6'11 you're just as unusual as she is.
"There is definitely something the police can do if the guy hacked into someones snapchat to threaten to beat you up.

Do you have a screenshot of the message?"
"To be fair to you, if I heard ""Bucky Balls"" and ""adult toy"" in the same sentence, I wouldn't assume the thing in question was particularly innocent!"
Make sure to maintain eye contact and then blame the nitrous oxide.
This honestly made me feel better.  Thank you!

Congrats!  And this is why you don't just start swiping through pictures on people's phones.
I thought taking my bird for a walk meant like putting a really small dog collar and a leash on him and walking him around so you walk around with a little waddling bird
Biggest unanswered question of the story
I once glanced at my dental folder when I was a kid and it said I had a 'strong' 'roaming' tongue. Not sure how I should feel about that.
Hopefully your family will have a laugh and enjoy your accomplishment. Have a family picnic.

"You were pretending to be French for ten months but you didn‚Äôt  bother to, you know, learn French?"
That will make a great story later when you do propose and now you can do it in the same fashion as well as a running joke.
"TMMFU

Well it was actually 17 years ago, when she gave birth to me"
You have to bang her mom.
I believe the usual answer would be the English.
Exactly. OP doesn't need a woman who's opinions change like the tide. Imagine a week day after marriage she wants a divorce because you forgot to flush a taco bell shit slurry that you left in the toilet accidentally after having to pick her up from the airport while also paying your overdue water bills because SOMEONE was suppose to do it in your place.

**Karen**: Yeah, but he's my first cousin.  
**Gretchen**: Right.

**Gretchen**: No, honey, nuh-uh.

"The other day I was in a park and a hummingbird zipped right in front of me and hovered.  I'd never seen one in the wild before, especially up close, so I whipped out my camera phone and started following him.   He mostly ignored me, zipping around to different flowers on the green.  I got some great shots.

After I was done, I realized half a dozen sunbathers were glaring at me, and the women were covering themselves and angrily whispering to their friends.  The hummingbird was invisible from where they were.  I was just some weirdo who ran out on a grassy area where women were working on their tans and started taking pictures left and right with an idiot grin on my face."

Yup. Get away from that mess asap. Nothing good will come of it.

"The ""Double crap"" killed me"
Your dad realized he had been blind to the possibilities and had to immediately try it for himself
"Between the fianc√© and I, apologies were bouncing back and forth. She felt bad. I felt bad. **My penis felt worse**. My roommate on the other hand, he had a stomach bug and couldn't really mock me as much he wanted to. Poor dude. The three of us had a good laugh over breakfast. We praised the fianc√© for preventing the zombie apocalypse as well as mourned my mangled balls."

Not of the Snapchat. I was kinda freaked out so I blocked it immediately. But the police have him documented saying he wants to fight from when we were pulled over. The other Roomates in the girls apartment   Can definitely vouch for me tho because the Ex told them what he was gonna do.
So did he give you an A or the D?

"When I unpacked his luggage, I found a harness for exactly that - and I've watched youtubes of people training their birds to wear them. But the first 5 seconds of the training videos are along the lines of ""Step one: make sure your bird is comfortable enough with you to lie on his back in the palm of your hand."" Pffft. May as well throw in that he needs to be trained to make my bed and braid my hair before we get started."

"Yeah I like how OP just kinda casually opened with that like ""Yeah so I was hanging out with my gf, and her friend was there too, and they were just making out, you know, as you do"". Like how did the question of ""Is this okay"" not even come up until they were already all in bed together naked, about to get started?"
In my experience I've always had guys talk about how hot me kissing a girl would be or a threesome would be and I'm having to remind them that it's cheating in my books and I'm monogamous.
"I don't think it was wrong, I love how liberal and caring my mom was bringing me up. Nothing I wanted to hear from her as her 16 year old son though. 

You're right, it'll come up for sure. She teases me about it whenever the opportunity arises. Guess I'll just have to tell everyone at the wedding before she can."
"Did you read any of her post history? She sounds like literally the funnest. 

&gt;He's made the mistake of going out of town a couple of times. The first time, I bought a ton of tin foil from the dollar store and literally wrapped every single item in his man cave in foil (not the TV tho) down to coins and the ceiling fan. The second time he went out of town, I had a bunch of friends over and we blew up a ton of balloons and stuffed his man cave floor to ceiling with them. That was actually really fun because the night he got home we did shrooms and played in the room full of balloons."
yeah but no one really gets to look down on 6 11 people.

"It sounds more like a maturity issue.  It was all fun and games until she realized how it was really making her feel.  I also suspect that when she said ""it was okay"", she really didnt mean it.  She just didnt have the maturity to handle the situation."

"You're second cousins which is definitely far enough apart there shouldn't be any type of genetic issues if you were to stay together and have kids. 

Additionally you mentioned that you felt he was the one. If you felt that strongly about him I feel like you should really question if that's worth giving up. Your parents aren't close at all with over 30 years estrangement. I've seen several people on Reddit make it work when it was worth it."
"I'm thirthy, in a 4 year relationship and about to have a kid.
Until just now I also thought blueballs was just slang or so for being touchy feely with someone but striking out and not getting laid."
My ex-boyfriend would always say it was ok for me to kiss girls because of how hot it was. The *one* time I took him up on that he threw a hissy-fit when he realized I wasn't kissing girls for *his* amusement and it wasn't going to lead to a three-way...

What is the etiquette for this on Reddit, it feels really weird just asking you to PM me your address, but if you want a switch it's yours all ya have to do is ask."
Maybe shes already two moves ahead of him.
Same thing happened to Walter White.  He was a making a meth deal when his daughter was born and life was a downward trajectory after that.

I arrived early to our regular open mic a few weeks ago.  To my surprise, there was a dwarf working as the door man.  Several times people stopped, saw me, saw him, and looked at eachother.

A little later I went up to him, intending to make friends, and assuming he knew I was a comedian.  ""You should tell people it's a convention.""  He looked confused.  ""You know, a little people's convention.""

He turned away from me and looked visibly offended.  I felt **horrible**.

"Boom, roasted."
"And likely necessary so you don't get accused of abusing the cat, which is one of the only other conceivable reasons he would be covered in blood."
(though at the same time I'm a little mystified why you didn't look up Bucky Balls in the first place to find out what kind of adult toys your friend was into! :p)
Sidestory about a strong tongue: a child I took care of had macroglossia. That‚Äôs an extremely large tongue that hung out of their mouth. We‚Äôre seeing the doc one day and doc puts a tongue depressor in their mouth. This kid in literally one fast as lightning flick of their tongue breaks the tongue depressor in half. This is a 1 yr old. It‚Äôs hands down the wildest thing I‚Äôve ever witnessed. I had no idea how strong tongues could be lol
They all ordered the meatloaf. And everyone agreed that it tasted just like Grandma used to make it.
Yes she did apologize but I 100% agree with you it makes no sense to me still that she would say any thing of that sort in general
"You know, as someone from the state, I've always hated that joke. Yeah we allow for first cousin marriages but so do most European countries. We know incest is bad, and there are so many states that deserve the jokes more than us, like West Virginia.

That being said, my first reaction to this TIFU was, ""But you're only second cousins!"" Then I realized there must be something in the water here..."
"You're really tall and she is really short, what else were you supposed to do? Your only other option would be [this](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/side-view-casual-young-man-looking-down-to-something-standing-hands-pockets-92009795.jpg)"

"I'd like to commend your roommate for his choice. Any woman, when woken by a zombie in her bedroom, still has the wits to kick him in the balls is clearly wife material. She will defend his offsprings like a true momma bear."
"""Didn't you see her sitting behind you during the wedding?""

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah.  Most people don't have eyes in the back of their heads.  Oh well, it happened, it won't happen again, and nothing really terrible came of it."
"No no no! You didn't fuck up at all bro! She was the one kissing her friend and doing stuff first, then asked you to join, then you made double sure it was ok, then she got jelly and broke up with you. Here is what I think happened. She was all hot and bothered and wanted it, then when her hornyness most likely calmed down a little bit she got really jelly but didn't want to seem like an asshole when you were about to put your D in her friend so she left the room. Then she spent all night twisting it around in her head to make her self feel better and pin you as the bad guy, then broke up with you. Absolutely 100% not your fault dude."
I don't understand these stock photos and how they can be so fucking relevant.
Suck-seed-ing
Truer words were never spoken.
"Ah good, so it's not just me that the dentist has to repeatedly to tell to move my tongue out of the way?"
"Thank you. I took the fact that he kept it as a sign that, all things considered, I‚Äôd picked a good gift."
Consider dominance asserted.
Yeah I'd rather jizz inside uncle Bill
"Well, if he had learned French then he wouldn't have been pretending anymore and that would just defeat the purpose."
That is hilarious. No one on earth would not laugh if that happened to them.
"#It's there now, whooo!"
"""After a lot (and I really mean A LOT) of trying, I'm happy to tell you you're gonna be a uncle!"""
I love this person immensely.
It really be like that sometimes
Protip: have small penis to make boners undetectable. Worked for me my entire life.
"Ugh yep had to deal with a similar thing myself. 

Girlfriend at the time was grinding, grabbing, and kissing on some girl at a party right in front of me. I straight up told her that wasn't ok, and her defense was ""it's ok because I'm not gay/bi"". 

Well guess who came out as bi a few months later, and guess who condemned one of my female friends for doing the exact same thing.

Glad to be out of that relationship."
"Right?  My best guess is that he has them for children's appointments and had run out of regular latex.  Our first appointment he just wore regular chalky latex gloves.  Apparently, these grape flavored ones are subtly delicious but I don't think he could be convinced to wear them on strange adults again."
"Right and if someone asked me for clarification I would definitely check the text above it, not say ""you heard me"" omg..."
"For the uninitiated:

https://youtu.be/V4akMaeZ0-k"
I see this as an absolute win
Why were the gloves flavored though? Sounds weird as fuck
"Yeah, if they were first cousins, that might be a minor worry (and it's really quite minor), with this stage of separation they'd be perfectly fine.  They've both effectively thrown away a good relationship over peer pressure(social stigma).

That's just a goddamn shame when you look at how miserable people generally are in this world."
OP did a bad job covering up his attempt to seduce his gfs mom.
"that's exactly it.  we weren't there.  we didn't see how lustful OP was when he grabbed her friend, compared to when he grabbed his gf.  she may have even been okay with it when she said she was okay, but as soon as she started seeing how aroused he was by it, she immediately became self-conscious.  she may have assumed it would've looked passionless, like porn, and that he would've then pulled out and taken her to reaffirm she was ""better,"" but he didn't... he kept nailing the friend for another 5 minutes after she'd left the room...  


she clearly signed up for something she wasn't ready for."
"You know even if it wasn't a video call and the girl couldn't hear the insult, seeing your kid's girlfriend for the first time and calling her ugly is fucked up to your kid. Why would someone do that?"
"&gt; Like how did the question of ""Is this okay"" not even come up until they were already all in bed together naked, about to get started?

There's this crazy thing you can buy now that reduces your inhibition and often leads to poor decision-making. It's some chemical you drink and it comes in a ton of different flavors. The name escapes me at the moment."

Maybe some people don't realize it's on. It's pretty fucked up that people install tracking software for themselves.
"Noooooo, I‚Äôm not ready for this."
"That‚Äôs the thing they tell you about being a dad, but you don‚Äôt really understand it until you experience it- there are things (like pain) that you wish you could take over for your kid, but you just can‚Äôt. And you just feel so helpless because you‚Äôve done everything you can do."
"Just remember that here in the UK marrying your first cousin is legal, so I'm pretty sure the sex must be too."
"he should be more coy about it. ""I think our chemistry is off"" or something like that"
"Probably the only mom too ever utter this to a son: ""Well then make sure you masturbate or something after sweety so that this doesn't happen again.""

Your mom is a legend!"
I think you know what you need to do but are avoiding it. She‚Äôs shady. If she screw you over once she will do it again. Give her the boot and find a woman that is loyal.
"My ex had a parakeet get away. While she watched him fly off, a hawk swooped down and grabbed him.

Then OP walked in to his dad‚Äôs room to explain and caught his dad in the same position. OP runs off to try it again and the cycle continues.

"In your DADS house??

Not your STEPDADS house??

Cursed Life.
"Should have hit him with ""je suis Canadien""

Source: studied in France in college and was amazed to find that a Canadian movie that was playing in France had to have subtitles! The French is very different. I had a job back in the USA where we had clients in Quebec and I couldn't understand anything they said.

Regardless, this is one of the funniest TIFUs I have every read and I admire your commitment to ""Keep Calm and Carry On French"""
"I worked for a little person manager in college. At one if the weekly staff meetings we (a bunch of chill college kids) were talking about goofy cereal mascots, the Trix rabbit, Captain Crunch, et cetera. The manager opens the door in a huff and shouts ""I am NOT a leprechaun!"" 

""Um, ma'am?"" says one of the workers. ""We were talking about cereal. Lucky Charms. You know...the mascot. Not about you."" 

It was awkward."
The best part of these ceremonies is the meal after with your family.
"Same. I always told my ex that I'd be down for a threesome. Somehow she understood that it was okay and that I would like it if she kissed her lesbian friend in a party that I wasn't in. What? Why would I be okay with you kissing a person behind my back? The whole point is for us to enjoy it together. At least ask me if it's okay before hand. We weren't in an open relationship.

But I forgave her, apparently she was only experimenting and realized that she was completely straight. Still doesn't make it okay to cheat on me. She said she only ""kissed her"" but who knows what really happened? I sure don't. I wasn't fucking there. Even if it was only a kiss, it's still cheating.

If I were to kiss a guy behind her back, she would consider it cheating. So why is it okay for her?? 

Yes, I'm still salty about it."
I‚Äôm afraid the legality wasn‚Äôt exactly the first thing on my mind.

"""Oh wow, your hairstyle is so different I didn't even recognize you! It looks fantastic!""

Probably because this guy is in the UK and most British people do not take kindly to open drug use? LSD would definitely rank up there as a big no no.
Imagine knocking up a whole family.
WTF he was not experienced with anal. You need a lot of work and time to get the asshole to open up to where having a dick in it is comfortable.
I did it again
No fucking way did this happen. Way too big of a chance that another student won‚Äôt get the joke and will report it or spread a rumor about the teacher. No teacher is that dumb.
"I'm not going to lie, I laughed audibly at this."
"Yeah, threaten the other guy by telling him you‚Äôre sending over your Reddit gang to beat him up."
"Kinda on both parties. Never go into a threesome blindly. 

Why I‚Äôve only had one in my life and it wasn‚Äôt with a bf. I don‚Äôt think I could ever watch my bf fuck another woman. I would also break up with him immediately, but I‚Äôd never get in that situation in the first place."
"Hey, I know you're reading this. Made you look. PEACE"
Are you crazy?! This is like discovering plutonium by accident!
"I gotta be honest, it's a good thing you went to the er to get it checked. Testicular torsion is a thing and it feels similar to what you're describing. All the bouncing and grinding could've caused that as well. Glad it wasn't though! Great story, I'm sure your mom really enjoyed busting your balls over this"
Hot
Only if you want them to blow you.
"That's rough... The thing is, it doesn't matter how ugly or beautiful you are. Looks change, they fade, they evolve. Some people are fat, tall, short, skinny, ugly, beautiful, have a weird face, head, or other weird looking parts. The chick from transformers has a really funky looking thumb. 

The point is, there is absolutely no reason to feel bad about yourself for being a little different, it makes you unique. Besides, if you think she's attractive, that's all that should matter to her in the end. But it does suck to have someone say you're not cute.

FYI: I had people tell me I was ugly in school because I was overweight. Guess what? I can lose weight Karen, but your parents are still divorced and you still have crabs..."
"I‚Äôd definitely keep trying to get the police to do something about it, they should be able to do something about the hacking for sure"

"Definitely. Hindsight is 20/20.

Well..laughing at oneself or wallowing in incest-fuelled despair after cumming inside your own genetics - you decide!
*Robin would be proud*.
I'd also like to adopt this mans grandparents.
"It's NOT cheating if you have ""permission"" from your partner, regardless of same or opposite sex."
"I dunno. Second cousins? I think maybe go for it. The situation is pretty fine, genetically speaking. It's not like you were raiaed as family, so no weird past. It's legal ... I think everywhere in the U.S. And you're in love.

This is maybe one of those things you shouldn't let social taboo decide for you - especially considering the taboo in question doesn't really apply to you."
Makes me think of the other thread on here now about a dude whose SO is into MMA and he keeps getting dirty looks because people think he's beating her up. I'd hate to think of the dirty looks you get dating someone others incorrectly perceive as a child.
"First time my husband trimmed our daughter's nails, he clipped the skin. Five years later he still feels bad about it for pretty much the exact same reason.
Funny part is that now he's still so careful cutting nails, that she asked him why he was so careful and he told her. So now she keeps saying ""remember that time you cut my finger and made me bleed?"" Guilt all over again."
"K so SHE can have sex with her friends in front of you without asking, but you are drawn in, ask if it's okay, and then she flips out? There's a serious imbalance here. She's done you a favour by breaking up with you. Don't be hard on yourself by believing you're the one who fucked up. Maybe she thought she'd be okay with it and discovered she wasn't, but for her to pay that on your shoulders is unfair."
So hold up a second. You went a few dates with her and this guy was your buddy for at least a little while I assume...how did you not know their last names and put 2 and 2 together?
Right here officer. He's the one.
"‚ÄúMom, Dad how did you meet?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWell I threatened to fuck your mother and it kind of just went from there.‚Äù"
"I'm sorry, little one."
Allow me to vigorously wave my cowboy hat while my cousin caresses my ballsack.
"Lol selfishness at its finest. My bf and I were at a party once and we were playing truth or dare and it of course ended up with me making out with the only other girl in the room. The girl ended up dating one of the guys there after that and they once hit me up for a threesome and I had to remind them I‚Äôm in a relationship and they tried to accuse me of cheating for making out with her and my bf had to step in and remind them that I asked my bf if it was ok and he said it was cause it was just a game and for him two girls isnt the same as him or I making out with the opposite sex. I mean, I get it but I also have a lesbian friend that hates that common attitude cause it devalues the actual worth of *real* lesbian relationships and tbh I‚Äôm fully onboard with her line of thinking and my bf and I have avoided situations like that since just purely out of respect for ourselves and for people like my friend that think that shit devalues their own feelings and relationship. Also, my bf and I r much more serious now so, it‚Äôs also changed."
Thanks! I really appreciate it. I try to do as much as I can. And They are amazing people. I just wish I could do some more.

"There's a woman like that who does returns every so often at my service desk (I work in retail). Perfectly proportioned, very attractive face, carries herself well, dresses fashionably. Elegant, in a word. But she's maybe 4""6, maybe 70 pounds. Maybe even smaller than that.

It's more disconcerting than you might think. If someone has some sort of obvious condition that makes them really short, or is just really out of proportion, then you know how to handle that.

But when she looks like she should be a runway model, except everything's shrunk down by 50%, it's Uncanny Valley time. It's easy to feel like YOU somehow grew by 50% by drinking some Alice in Wonderland potion."
"F.

"39 here and I was also unaware. How did this never happen to me after all those visits to the strip club, I‚Äôll never know."

"There's no way the kid saw the bird, he had to think either I or my husband whistled at him, and then the two of us thought it was great fun to harass him. I'm considering dropping off a letter of explanation/apology to the school office, addressed to the track coach today."
OP dodged a bullet tbh
"Ha no, it was too embarrassing to stay, but me and my SO left together and talked it out. We discussed that it wouldn‚Äôt be right, as his family and him are very religious, and yadeyada. He wasn‚Äôt comfortable with it, and ultimately he ended it :/"

"Yeah I would've just been ""oh hi I was drunk lastnight, sorry.""

"Had a girlfriend who had lesbian tendencies (actually during a short breakup, she hooked up with a stripper for a while, then came back to me)...anyway, had that 'hypothetical' conversation of a threesome...we had a mutual friend who was a lesbian.  My gf said she would be all about it, but I wouldn't be allowed to touch the other girl...of course, this never happened in real life, but just to argue 'fariness', I questioned why it would be acceptable for her to take part in it but not me.  this was a while go, but I think her only argument was, ""because it's ok for girls to do it, but not the guy and another girl"".  Needless to say, the hypothetical situation turned into an argument, and not because of this argument (it was a culmination of many different arguments about many things), but that's sort of how the relationship went (very lopsided), I gave up and left her.

Edit: Within the specific argument, I suggested that I would not touch the other girl, but would want to still be involved, at least with her...she said no to that also because (I don't know) selfish reasons."
The only reason I can think of is OP and other girl were very into each other in the moment kinda ignoring girlfriend which would explain her running off in the first place

"I have yet to find a girl that can have sex without telling at least one person about it. 

And once you tell one, they will tell another and that's how it spreads."
"Oh lord, no, my arm has gotten sore from trying to retract tongues away from where I‚Äôm working on some patients. It‚Äôs part of the job. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd even notice if someone was licking me, tbh."
Be funny if the real TIFU was breaking up with the person they'd be happiest with in life.
"Everyone forgot about him, and he's stuck in his house to this day."
"I laughed internally. My wife is from Alabama. 

No, we're not cousins."
"I trimmed my new daughter's nails a few weeks ago and clipped the skin. She is only 4 months old and her fingers are so tiny.

I cried more than she did."
"Is there a way for you to fill their larder/cupboards with a good ‚Äúpreppers‚Äù range of stocks and canned long life foods or other things to keep them going in case of snow/payments being delayed?

"Even still, she is your girlfriend and is making out and feeling up another girl and that is no big deal? Like he was so casual about it. 

My initial thought was maybe they are the swinger type, but then when she got so offended about him joining in then it just seemed very weird."
"Unfortunately she was (is) a stunner and my type in every way, even looking like about 80% of my past relationships and hook-ups. Not up for that Alabama shit though. Can assure you, I didn‚Äôt fucking know."
Turn it around by breaking OP's arms.
"You should have taken the condoms. It would ease your parents minds, and your wallet."
"plus if they havent seen each other in like 30 years it's not even the whole ""grown up with"" thing or THAT embarassaing at family gatherings"
At least you didn't bang your aunt and then like a month later learn that you're entitled to have her job and all her property as well.
It makes me happy knowing somewhere out there there is a pet chicken who gets to be described as adventurous. Good for that chicken
"Are you my mom?

My dad did the exact same thing. Fooled everyone and told everyone the morning of not to come. He called my mom and told her to cancel the cake that morning."
Congraduation?!
"""She'll leave you the same way she came to you"" is a set-in-stone rule that is well known to people that have been around the block a few times."
"Before he can leave, OP's dad says to lay down next to him so they can share techniques. Bent over, buttholes skyward, it occurs to each of them that they're contorting themselves trying to put dicks in their mouths when there's an easier solution. Father and son lock eyes for but a moment..."

"I wholly agree I wish it was explicitly laid out for me. I think they figured by giving the Bucky Balls example I‚Äôd know they meant kid-style toys designed for adults. Everyone else seemed to understand it out of the gate, so maybe my mind is just deeper in the gutter than theirs."

It was in dad's house. Dad took the pictures.
"What ,!"
No. He should pin the mother down and drum on her ass while staring intently at the father to truly establish dominance.

Then maybe you can arrange a threesome with your ex.
"It sucks she didn't know you were on a call but I wouldn't say that's your fault man. If I was her I'd be hurt too, body image can really destroy you as it did me when I was younger, I just hope she focuses on what you see in her and not what your mother sees."
Ain't no lovin' like my cousin'! yehawww!
r/suddenlygay
That's straight up gaslighting at the end.
Everyone is different.  OP did every responsible thing he could have done in this situation.  This is on her.  Some people get turned on watching their significant others with someone else.  To each their own.  OP didn't know one way or the other.
"Wrong, everyone knows you‚Äôre supposed to take a shovel and dig your feet lower into the ground so you‚Äôre both the same height."
"I don't think many people realize how culturally normal marrying first cousins and second cousins used to be, it was extremely common in some cultures even less than 100 years ago (and still is). Especially if you lived in a small town/village. 

I bet if we went back a few generations, most people in this thread would be the product of a marriage between second cousins. I believe most peoples' disgust towards this type of thing is purely cultural conditioning, and not really based on the science or genetics."

Totally.

My dad tricked me one xmas morning saying Santa hadn‚Äôt been and I said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs ok‚Äù and carried on playing with my toys upstairs completely unfazed. He was obviously only joking and downstairs was full of presents it was just a joke but he still feels awful to this day. I literally can‚Äôt remember a thing and find it funny but everytime it gets brought up he goes I‚Äôm so sorry! üòÇ
"He's probably told that story to all his friends by now.   ""And there, pointed directly at me, was his asshole!"""
"My neighbors had this cockatoo they'd let sit outside in their backyard pretty much all day everyday. Their backyard backs up to a trail in the park, so people are always walking by. The problem is, when the bird decides she's done being outside she gets the owners attention by yelling ""Help! Help!.......Help!"" and she sounds like a person, so people have called the cops saying a woman was being held against her will there. The first time, the cops showed up, searched the house, then met the parrot and understood. So they leave them alone now. The parrot's name is Jeffrey, btw. They didn't find out Jeffrey was a girl until they'd had her 20 years."
"Lol. You should have just responded with "" ‚Äúje voudrais une boulangerie‚Äù again to the French guy haha."
"Haha, my phrasing might have been off.  The nude picture had her face in it."
"\&gt;He probably forgot about the interaction shortly afterwards.

 

Wait, you guys get to forget awkward interactions instead of reliving them every night and cringing yourself to sleep for the rest of your lives? Cool."
I knew a girl in St Louis who would bring her chicken on walks to the park while she played Pokemon Go. She said the harness she used was technically a cat harness but it worked perfectly.
"Wait is it not normal for the dentist to be directly in front of you sitting between your legs and leaning over your chest to look in your mouth?

"Honestly, 2nd cousins have a low chance of producing genetic defects.  Only 3% of DNA is actually shared, so it really is more of an awkward social situation than a medical one."

Wow OP congrats.
"I started laughing out loud when he said his French persona had picked up little bits of English, enough to talk to the neighbors in broken conversation. But he didn't pick up enough french to answer a probably simple question like ""where in France did you come from?"" or ""how long have you been here?"" Too funny and impossibly embarrassing. They must think OP is insane. I'd have to move lol"
"excuse me, but what exactly is this...""potato"" you're referencing?"
They're everyone's enemy.

As a family member having been to more than one long boring graduation - they may feel a bit happy to miss the actual ceremony.  This is a time to celebrate YOUR accomplishments.  Put on your robe and go out to dinner.  Laugh and enjoy your self.  Note - your mom probably will not be happy though.
"And that, kids, I why I wanna bone the fuck out of your Aunt Robin."
"It's okay, until she tricks him into showing up to the wedding too."
"If OP's friend is John Smith and his sister is Mary Smith, if he says to John ""hey I'm dating this hot girl named Mary"", its a common enough first name that John may assume its not his sister, and a common enough last name that if OP didn't know John's sister's name he would have no reason to assume they're related."
"I tested your theory.

I'd have tossed the book over the shower rod at her and walked out the door.
Well my gf broke up with her ex for beating the shit out of her so hopefully that‚Äôs rule isn‚Äôt set in stone
The answer might change everything.
I'm trying to figure out how it's physically possible to accidentally do this
"I hope this doesn't get too downvoted, but second cousins aren't too related to marry and have kids. In fact, about 10.4% of relationships worldwide are that close or closer.  There is no data that children of *second* cousin relationships have any worse health outcomes than strangers. By the time you are second cousins, you are nearly as related as strangers.

Here's a nice meta analysis done by FiveThirtyEight about it: [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-americans-are-married-to-their-cousins/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-americans-are-married-to-their-cousins/)

You may still feel weird about that relationship after reading this, but it's mostly just from the intense social stigma that people (mostly Americans) place on incest. My point is, **you don't have to break up for fear of problems in your potential children**. If you are going to break up, it's only because society has an outdated view of second cousin relationships."
So he could only tell it was her by her naked body?
"It was the family house and the Dad kept it in the divorce. Now, the same house is referred to as ""Dad's"" while OP now lives in a new house with Mum."
"Sorry to hear that, bud. Glad you‚Äôre in a better place."
I love this post and I'm so glad this had a happy ending! I hope everyone is okay including Jimmy :)
No threesome for you!

"I opened it, realized my phone wasn't muted, got ready to mute it, realized it was just the Seinfeld theme song and decided not to, how bad could it be if my mom heard the Seinfeld theme? Then the ad came (and apparently so did she)."

"my grandparents live in another state, so I can't just stop by their house whenever they need something.  


I speak to them on the phone every Wednesday evening without fail - 90% of the time it's a half-hour conversation about what some lady at church said or a ridiculously detailed explanation of what they had for dinner, but it's worth sitting through just for those few calls where they casually mention that the gutters are overflowing and Grandpa's going to get up on the ladder tomorrow to clean them or something else that puts the fear of god into me and that I wouldn't have heard about if it weren't for our weekly chats.   


They'd never dream of asking for help, or calling to say that they're struggling with something,  but they let things slip in our weekly calls that let me know when I need to interfere (either by flying up there myself, or booking a maintenance working/cleaner/asking that lady at church to sort something for them)  


definitely can't underestimate the power of a weekly chat!"
"So tomorrow: ""TIFU by thinking i missed my graduation and then *actually* missed it""?"
Honestly if I were the dad and you did this I would demand that you marry her on the spot.
Is her actual name Sansa
Theres a stock image for everything. Seriously look It up.
At least you're laughing at yourself i guess? Yay positive!
"What are you, his hype man??"
Pretty much any Muslim country. They're known for marrying in family such as cousins. I work at a Muslim bank and a lot of them are married to their cousins.

You got me!
Who were the 4 different numbers? Were the first night's texts actually for you?
Today I fucked ~~up~~
Or his
It's also a dangerous game. There's a good chance you could swipe to something you do *not* want to see. I guess OP is one good case of exactly that.
I thought you said uncomfortable?
Just like grandma used to make!
"TIL! My dad was Japanese and never wore deodorant. Even after summer soccer games he never smelled. He always said most Japanese don‚Äôt use deodorant, but I was always like, ‚ÄúEh, okay.‚Äù Now I know there‚Äôs a scientific reason!!

"They're not deleted, the messages are just hidden from you. You, or maybe the police with your permission, can contact a social networks/phone provider to gain access to the messages"
