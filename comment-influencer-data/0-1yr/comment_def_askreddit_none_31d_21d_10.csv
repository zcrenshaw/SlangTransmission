"Majora's Mask. 

Castlevania 3. 

MGS3.

Mario 64.

AoE2/Def edition.

Halo 2. 

Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon.

And for the memes, GoldenEye 64 - as much of a nightmare it is in hindsight, but hands down one of the most enjoyable multiplayer games ever."
I went to a local junkyard looking for a car.  They had a Geo Prizm for $800. I bought it and droke it for 60k miles and only paid for routine maintenance. It def was not fancy but I loved that car
"My 49.99$ (2nd Feb) airpods, the guy said that they were used and a bit scuffed so he would give me them for 40$ , ended up not working so I contacted him and he told me he sold me the wrong ones (1st Gen), he told me to come over to his place and he'd give me the right ones. The guy ended up giving me the airpods and a case for them. Overall not really sketchy but def one of my best purchases."
"Oh wow, that would def be weird lol"
