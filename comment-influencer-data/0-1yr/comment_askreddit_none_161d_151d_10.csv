"What wrong with crushing but maintaining a platonic relationship as a teenager. A sexual partnership and relationship is a very complex thing. Teenage dating causes stunted maturity and development. 

“When Katie Stubblefield's boyfriend broke up with her, in a moment of madness and despair, the pretty teenager snatched her brother Robert's hunting rifle, locked herself in the bathroom and shot herself in the head.

When Robert kicked down the door, he discovered his sister with her face 'gone'.

The bullet, which was fired upwards as she rested the gun barrel under her chin, had destroyed almost everything in an upwards and inwards triangle, from her chin to between her eyebrows.”"
Smart. Time management is key. Do your homework while you do laundry.  Make it to class. Use tutoring services. I used to do my calc homework when they had tutoring sessions. Sometimes I just finished my homework. Sometimes I had pointed questions. You got this!!!

"The logic behind that is that they serve an important purpose, allowing the rest of the population to rest in peace, and have arguably the most dangerous job: no other jobs involve a literal enemy army working on killing you."
"A little bit of back story. I have had 4 different surgeons for this problem. The first surgery I have had with each has been very bumpy. The first surgery I had with my first doc was my last with him. The operation went well, but the healing not to much. I abused him a lot (verbal, physical). He went back to Medical School.ibwas really young when that happened, (like 5 years of age). The second doctor had me admitted and confined to a wheelchair for 2 weeks because my balance was gone. The third doctor I puked on. They forgot to put me on practically every anti-nausea medication that had.

I ""caused"" an ""Oh Shit"" moment for my newest surgeon (otoneurologist). He had just finished his supervised surgeries and was out on his own. He had taken my case from an ENT in town due to extreme complications. I was his second solo operation ever.

They knocked me out, attached me to the various machines and started cutting into my ear to replace bones and my eardrum. Right around that moment, the machine responsible for facial paralysis monitoring started malfunctioning. High pitched whistling, smoke, etc. Had it broken 10 minutes later, he would've been screwed. Luckily, he hadn't gotten to far, and just stitched me up and sent me home. Theybcouldbfiz or replace the machine on the fly."

"I don’t know, I think people spend too much time sitting around and letting their brain go crazy. I work in health records, and while there definitely are legit crazy people, there are also a lot of teens seeing psychiatrists because they got picked on in 4th grade or something. Get over it, get outside, see the world and stop dwelling on things that happened 10 years ago. I don’t know how people who dwell like that will ever be able to function in life, and therapists enabling them to talk about it more and prescribing pills to teenagers aren’t helpful in my opinion."

"&gt;Ah I read that part but I didn't realize that was your answer. So even if you really do believe that a trans person isn't ""really"" the gender they aren't, why do you feel that your feelings are more important than theirs? 

It's cool. Not your fault, I have terrible formatting on mobile. It has nothing to do with my feelings, just facts.

&gt; You think they are *pretending* they are something they aren't, but in their reality, they've had to do that their whole lives. They're finally able to be who they really are. 

 Not sure if we're on the same page here. They're still pretending.


&gt;It doesn't matter whether or not you recognize the legitimacy of people's transitions. If you *know* someone is struggling with their gender identity and they are doing something drastic to make themselves happy, whats wrong with that? What makes your sense of moral superiority more important than someone else's happiness?

Im a do whatever floats your boat guy. But I live in reality, and the the reality is it's impossible to change your gender unless we evolve to a point that our bodies can naturally, without *any* outside interference, switch from one gender to another.  If that means not acknowledging someone's ""identity"" just it will hurt their feelings, oh well, welcome to the real world."

"Ok but 90s and 2000s music is straight trash for me. I would be surprised if any of it survives. I genuinely think older music was just better in general. There are countless old artists people still listen to. Who is going to be listening to backstreet boys, nsync, Brittany Spears, destiny's child, limp bizkit, Nelly, ja rule, Jennifer Lopez, spice girls, or whoever that isn't just looking for a nostolgia fix? There may be some hidden gems but they definitely aren't going to be heard, as they are hidden. At some point music became about profits and lifestyle,  not about soul, and we just got a bunch of low standard music with low talent, yet marketable, artists. Only recently has it started to come back to people making music for the love of music getting noticed because of self promotion. 

/Rant.

Tldr: I think 90s music is actually terrible"

"Controversial and im not well versed in the bible but.....im not gonna base my life (born cathlic, baptism, communion, confirmation) on the fact that mary didnt sleep with someone else. 
My simple understanding:
She was with jesus, they never had sex.
Mary becomes pregnant, alas immaculate conception. 
If mary cheated in those times:
1)death
2)exile
She lies, becomes a pariah vs the obv alternative 

If mary lied, is there a catholic religion.
