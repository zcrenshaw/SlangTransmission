In my early 20's, blitzed off my ass at a friend's house, I got a severe case of the munchies. My brilliant ass, sitting on the floor in front of a nearly empty couch, turns to my friends and asks, ""Shit, I'm hungry. Ooo I want pizza! Hey how much is the $5.00 pizza at Dominos?"" For the life of me I couldn't figure out why they were laughing so hard. What felt like a lifetime goes by, I'm seriously hungry and irritated they won't tell me the price so I jump up and grab a $20 from the munchie jar then angrily storm out saying, ""Whatever. $20 should be enough."" It wasn't until I was walking back with the pizza did I realise what has happened. "

"I was driving through my neighborhood one night and out of nowhere this spider almost as big as my fist darts out of my dash vent and directly into my line of sight on the inside of my windshield. My lizard brain took over and with zero hesitation I let of the steering wheel, unsnapped my seatbelt with my right hand and opened my door with my left hand, in full preparation for a barrel roll out of the fucking car at 25mph. Thankfully I snapped myself out of it quickly enough to shut the door and stop the car, then killed the spider and went about my evening. 

But I came very close to crashing my car and injuring myself. Instincts are a bitch sometimes"
"If there was an accident, it would be 100% his fault. His action caused the wreck. It‚Äôs just like if someone swerved to avoid an animal and bumps another car, that‚Äôs their fault because that decision and action led to the accident. Just like in this case, his split second decision to smash the spider. I worked a wreck where a girl had a psychotic break. Ended up hitting 5 cars. She was still at fault. 

In this case, no accident happened so it‚Äôs unlikely that any charge would occur. Technically by law, they could cite him with unsafe movement or failure to maintain lane. "
"Almost got in an accident once because while attempting to flick a cigarette out my window it deflected off the rim and bounced behind me, pinned between my ass and the seat. I had to attempt to drive, and swipe it out from underneath me without burning myself and also not knowing if I got it or not because I couldn't take my eyes off the road to look. Propped myself above the seat for about 10Km until I could pull over and verify I had gotten it off my seat."

"Yikes, dude, ease off the Game of Thrones. 

First off, most LARP weapons are made of high-density foam, lycra, and fibreglass. Most shields are wood,boften wrapped in leather. There's a fairly high level of skill involved in making them well, it's not like a pool noodle and the side of a box.

Second, broken bones? For a game? This is real life, not fantasy. I'm talking about children here. Even bruises are too far.

Third, using historically accurate weaponry can be done in LARP, but fighting with them is not appropriate in a LARP setting. That's called Historical European Martial Arts, or HEMA. Only if I were running a LARP for a HEMA group would I allow any weapon not entirely surrounded by foam, and full armour would be a requirement. "

More importantly, stop telling people to stay calm when most people wouldn't stay calm in that situation.

"That's the accidental incest section - if you accidentally commit incest they don't punish you but you have to void the marriage.  If you knowingly commit incest that's a crime.

The incest laws which you can find on Wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_regarding_incest_in_the_United_States

Alabama

""(a) A person commits incest if he marries or engages in sexual intercourse with a person he knows to be, either legitimately or ****illegitimately****:

(1) His ancestor or descendant by blood or adoption; or (2) His brother or sister of the whole or half-blood or by adoption; or (3) His stepchild or stepparent, while the marriage creating the relationship exists; or (4) His aunt, uncle, nephew or niece of the whole or half-blood.

(b) A person shall not be convicted of incest or of an attempt to commit incest upon the uncorroborated testimony of the person with whom the offense is alleged to have been committed.

(c) Incest is a Class C felony. [1] ""

Alaska

Either legitimately or illegitimately: (1) an ancestor or descendant of the whole or half blood; (2) a brother or sister of the whole or half blood; or (3) an uncle, aunt, nephew, or niece by blood. 

Arizona

Persons with degrees of consanguinity which makes marriage incestuous and void (knowingly). These are: ""between parents and children, including grandparents and grandchildren of every degree, between brothers and sisters of the one-half as well as the whole blood, and between uncles and nieces, aunts and nephews and between first cousins"" 

The list goes on.  The punishment seems to be jail time +/- a fine if done knowingly.  This is from what I could find online anyway; I do not claim to be an expert in the legal aspects, nor do I wish to be.  Just kind of surprised at the number of people advocating something illegal.

"I don't quite understand your question so I'll just explain DNA inheritance and hopefully I answer your question.  Everyone has 23 pairs of chromosomes plus either xx or xy, if they're genetically normal (ie Down Syndrome, Turner Syndrome, Klinefelter Syndrome are all examples where this is not true).  When the egg or sperm is being produced by meiosis, what happens is there is swapping of the genes on the chromosomes first.  So basically Grandpa and Grandma's DNA end up on the same chromosome. This process is called genetic recombination https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination.  An egg or sperm only has 1 copy of each chromosome, one from Mom and one from Dad.  The DNA in those chromosomes, however, is not identical from sperm to sperm.  

Each child has half their DNA from Mom and half from Dad.  Full siblings get 1 chromosome from Mom and one from Dad; on average, they share about 50% DNA.  The math behind it, going to type it out later once I'm on my laptop as my phone battery is dying: placeholder here.  Half siblings as in this case share about 12.5% DNA.  

If you're interested, https://genetics.thetech.org/ask-a-geneticist/siblings-are-around-fifty-percent-related

I saw the update thread too.  It's such a cluster**** with people advocating illegal behaviors (the law doesn't care about what you think ought to be legal, it either is legal or it isn't) and incorrect comments such as children of the first generation of inbreeding not having an increased risk of deformity/death.  Frankly I spent my energy crafting the replies the first time around, but don't have the energy to repeat it all every time this issue comes up.  If someone wants to copy paste from my posts, feel free, just credit me somewhere."
This is probably the happiest ending that could have come from this. I wish you both a happy relationship as brother and sister!

"Yep, I don't have the exact statistics but pretty much. We (society) have created a very social taboo (hence, knee jerk, absolutely no kids) because generationally it is VERY VERY bad, half siblings after none of that, very unlikely to be a big deal.

I respect your decisions to end things. I really do. But then I start to think about the future and what are some likely situations you both might face. (I'm a mom, I can't help it.) I'm glad you are both in therapy. I hope it can give you both the results you are seeking. Im just speaking from experience but a relationship ending from some outside force instead of the two falling out of love...I think that will be a hard hurdle to cross. Are either of you going to be able to move forward, and not compare a new partner to you or her? How could a new partner even come close to comparing to the person you love but society says you cant?  Ok, say you both do meet someone else. You're going to have to explain all this to them. And I imagine will still be trying to form a healthy sibling relationship. Your partner's might not be ok with that. Jealousy is real. What if a partner gives the ultimatum, them or sibling? What if after all the therapy and effort, you still love who you love? 

I only mention these things because there could be countless other indirect situations arise and you've mentioned early on you were feeling suicidal. Honey, I'm sorry, but this whole thing is going to be really hard for probably a very long time. You *cannot* let suicide be an option. You did nothing wrong. There are NO wrong decisions from the start until you're both 99 years old. Please, don't take on the burden of guilt. You both might be doing really well for years. Then seeing her with a new man, or seeing her wedding invitation, or her pregnant might be something that cracks the facade and all your love will break through the dam of therapy work. It might not, I'm no psychic but if it does...please don't see it as a failure. I don't want to read about you taking your own life because you felt guilt and shame about something you have zero control over. You can't unlove. If you both separate and for years do everything possible to disengage as partners and try to form a sibling bond but it doesn't work, so be it. You tried. If you both still love each other, then fuck it, go for it. Just don't let anything be a failure on your part. Because it's not. Don't let suicide be an option. Nobody knows what it's like to be you. So who tf cares what they have to say about YOUR life? You can get through anything darlin, long as quitting is not an option. Good luck and we're all rooting for you. "

"Sorry but I'm a bit confused. Firstly, why is this allowed? From the title and a quick read it seems like a clear ad for a (useful) browser plugin.

Second, I feel nervous of anyone scraping my reddit feed, a plugin could be scraping so much more than what you say. I'm not saying you are doing this by any means...but we have to trust you that you won't ever inject arbitrary JavaScript into our browsers. You could literally steal the passwords for everysite your users visit and I don't think most people are aware that a browser plugin can do this.

Now, I do really support open-source (which this project claims to be), however I really don't like how you are promoting this with external links.

I respect that you've made a very tough decision. But had you never taken the test, what would be different? Love is love and it's rare. Whatever path you decide to continue down, good luck to both of you. This is difficult."

Then it's your duty to safely pull over. 

&gt; please explain how you would suddenly have the ability to pull over safely?

Maybe you should take a driving course to learn various techniques to pull over as safe as possible in different risk scenarios?

Among other things: Check for traffic, use indicator lights, reduce speed smoothly rather than slamming on your brakes, turn smoothly rather than swerving abruptly.

&gt; In practice it makes absolutely zero sense.

In practice it more than makes sense, it's the law. You are the operator of the vehicle and it's your responsibility to safely get the vehicle off the road if it can not be driven safely."

Hello front page.
"Years ago I bought a house.  It had a solar water heater on the roof.  Being Miami, this worked well but there were usually a month or so in the winter when it didn't really work that well,  but it was good enough.  I forget the years now, sometime in the mid 2000's, I guess,  when we got hit 5 or 6 hurricanes and tropical storms. The first one destroyed the solar water heater.  I did a quick repair, on the roof so it wouldn't leak but it just didn't heat like it use too. I got pretty use to taking cold showers for the next 4 months. Actually, I didn't get use to it,  I took cold showers and it sucked.  Once hurricane season was over,  I went to replace the solar water heater which meant climbing into the attic (more of a crawl space) to unbolt the unit from the inside.  I had only peaked into the attic at this point, so this was my first time going into it.  I crawled about 20 feet towards the fireplace and there was an area you could kinda stand in. Which was where the bolts came through for the solar water heater. Once I got there, I noticed an actual electric powered water heater. My first thought was,  how did they get this thing up here,  and I guess I figured it was used as a storage unit for the solar water heater.  Then I noticed it was actually hooked up to a power line.  I followed the line to just over the stove (where the stove top hood vent came through the ceiling) 

Anybody who's ever bought an old house will probably tell you that there's always one light switch that doesn't seem to turn anything on.  Well,  there was a light switch,  right above the stove that didn't seem to have a purpose that I could figure out.  But guess what,  it turned on the water heater.  I could have been taking hot shower whole time. "
This would break more things than it would fix.
"Y‚Äôall ever heard of the fact that flow rate is a function of pressure and diameter of an opening?The air limiter works at a known pressure in the air plunger, if you increase that that, the dart will go faster no matter what. If you increase the diameter of the opening in the air limiter, the dart will go further. The air limiters aren‚Äôt pressure-calibrated bleed valves, they‚Äôre just constricting the diameter of the opening to decrease flow rate.

More pressure=more flow

Larger diameter=more flow

More flow=more dakka.

Simple equation."
"My friend loves to tell the story of being at his wife's exam early in her pregnancy when the doctor was doing his thing and my friend looks under the sheet and pipes up and says ""I think he lost his watch!""
