"woah this is weirdly similar to something my own dad did. once my sister got a mosquito bite on her face that swelled her eye up n when the chemist asked what happened my dad who couldnt even speak the language, decided doing a punching motion to her 8 year old face while laughing was a good option. the look on the womens face, turns out laughing isnt so universal after all lmaoo luckily there were no repercussions tho!"

That sucks OP. When I was about 5 we had to write a story about how we would feel if one of our siblings ran away. I said I'd be fine with it because my big brother is annoying (as all big brothers are). However because he was 9 years older than me my teacher thought he was abusing me....! People are idiots. 
Yep you're an idiot
Seems like a strange rule. You can fuck up without anything bad happening directly to you. 
"As for how I got my arachnophobia, I grew up on a family farm in rural NSW. It was a floodplain, and in the rainy season (Late Feb-Mar) it would often flood about 75-80% of our paddocks.

Anyone who‚Äôs been near laying floodwaters after a flood knows how many bugs, insects, and spiders are drawn out from it. 

The first incident occurred when I was about 4. We took the tinny for a motor down our laneway to check on the fences. We had to guide the boat between a cattle ramp. The entire ramp, that was above water, was covered in spiders. It was like an optical illusion of movement. Millions of them, crawling over each other to escape the water. As we floated past, Mum and I were so terrified that the cloud of spiders was going to jump to the boat. I just remember screaming and crying while my Dad said ‚Äúshe‚Äôll be right, they know they‚Äôre fine there‚Äù. 

The second, and more traumatic experience occurred about 4-5 years later, so I was about 9? My younger brother and I had recently got a blowup raft thing for Christmas. My brother was dying to test it out on the remaining laying water. Due to my uneasiness with spiders, I wasn‚Äôt super keen. 

So my Dad decided the best place to take off was from an old gate down by the water. The gate was partially underwater and covered in spiders (nowhere near as bad as the above incident, but enough to make me think ‚Äòyeah nah no go hey‚Äô. Dad, after briefly struggling to get the boat over the barbed wire fence, told us he was going to lift us over the gate and plop us into the boat. No worries for my shorter, 7 year old brother. But for my lanky, 25ish kg heavier self, we had an issue.

Note, by the time Dad had me in the air, I was squirming and jumpy from not wanting to touch the gate spiders. In Dads attempt to loop me over the gate, he ended up just pressing me against it. With HUNDREDS OF SPIDERS ON IT. 

I‚Äôm amazed that I didn‚Äôt get bitten then. I‚Äôm even more amazed Dad managed to have a second go and manage to get me over the gate. But remember how I said Dad struggled to get the INFLATABLE RAFT over the BARBED WIRE FENCE. Yup.
 
We got maybe 3 metres out, in about 2ft deep water, when the boat started sinking. Couple this with all the water spiders (that can RUN on FUCKING WATER) charging at the boat, I felt a fear I haven‚Äôt felt sense. Like a primal get-the-bloody-hell-out-of-the-water fear. My brother and I waded/ran back to the gate, which Dad had opened by this time. 

Once I hit the shoreline I proceeded to rip my shirt/shorts off, and slap myself until all the spiders were gone. To this day I question the logic as to 1. Why my parents decided we should play in the spider infested floodwaters and 2. Why Dad didn‚Äôt just open the fucking gate to begin with."

And my son raised his hand to say when he and his brother wrestle and his brother sits on him, it makes his tummy feel funny. He was literally talking about his brother sitting on top of his stomach when they play wrestle.

CPS showed up first at my older son's school and pulled him out of class to ""interview""/question him, then at our house that afternoon. There was a whole investigation. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

"When in Iraq on guard duty on a roof, I had to take a shit so I called the Sergeant on guard (SOG). The guy, I can't remember what he was doing but I am 99% positive he was watching TV one floor below me, told me that he wasn't going to come up so I can go take a shit. Left with no options, I took a shit on a disposable plate. I threw it into a near empty sandbag and dumped it off the side of the building. (It was between the building and the wire, so I figured no one would go down there.) 

Next day, a policing detail discovered it. The Sergeant that wouldn't help me out at that time was scuffed up by the acting first sergeant for that. He was pissed that ""somebody"" (me) felt so compelled to shit like that. My team leader was on the policing detail. He got all the guards together and proceeded to yell at us and said that whoever did that should call and asked. 

In short, that day the SOG fucked up because he was lazy."

"Similar thing happened with my mom one time but with less consequences.

No you don‚Äôt get to eat on tuesdays.‚Äù 

I pretended to be super sad like I always did and she would order me an icee or something and it was all well and good. It was a running joke we had. Single mom and all that, we had a unique relationship. Well this particular day, some middle aged woman behind us in line flipped her shit and got on her soapbox about how she was a defender of children everywhere blah blah blah and called the cops. She made a huge scene in the grocery store and the manager got involved and everything. 

Long story short, my mom works for the police department and one or two of the officers who lived near us would watch me from time to time while my mom worked her other jobs. One of the female officers was the person who responded to the call and immediately busted up laughing when she saw it was us. The lady continued to create a scene for about 5 minutes before storming out, leaving her cart of groceries in the line where she stood."

I had a similar situation but I was the child. All my family is very skinny, I had 14 years old I was 1.75m and weight like 45kg. I made a ton of sports and ate a ton of food. One day I was talking with my teacher and told, as a joke, that I was skinny because my mother didnt give me enough pizza and pasta... She was a young teacher, misinterpret the situation and called social services because I wasnt being feed. After medical exams, metabolic exams (I needed at the time 5000kcals a day just to keep my weight) doctors informed that I was very healthy and strong and problems solved.

The funny thing is that the person that got more angry was the teacher, because the principal called her and told her that she needs to talk about the situation with all the people related with the issue before call social services for situations like this. That year she called social services to almost everyone in my class, it was a very difficult year to the principal.

"Oh my God, this takes me back to what became the start of over two years of panic attacks, a period of time I'm not completely done with yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Had googled symptoms of stroke, aneyurism, heart attack and so forth the day before. Was eating chinese food with my girlfriend and suddenly felt weird. Since my brain instantly went to symptoms of stroke, my brain ceased functioning properly due to absolute panic. I couldn't mutter a word, convincing me further that I was having a stroke. Tunnel vision due to panic. I was fainting. Food didn't taste like anything, we get a doggy bag and leave. Girlfriend told me I was having a panic attack, and I was focusing way too much on whether or not the weight felt a little bit shifted to the left or right, which it does once you start noticing the fact that bodies aren't perfectly symmetrical, you have habits and tendencies for how you move and maneuver (usually biasing one side over the other), and from that day forward, small anomalies in how I percieve the world result in a panic attack that I desperately try to convince myself isn't a stroke, aneyurism or heart attack.

&amp;#x200B;

  
DO NOT obsess over symptoms. Ever. This shit cost me hundreds in therapy, and over a year spent in mental agony, anxiety and depression. Maybe I was scheduled to suddenly develop anxiety and this was the shape it took, but seriously. DO NOT obsess over symptoms."

* Lose a classified laptop while traveling to a foreign country

* or, forget you left a wrench inside of a jet engine

Then the military might be for you!

Bad news:

If you cannot:

* take group punishment because a soldier in a different unit at a different base got a DUI and killed a local civilian causing the entire island to be put on restriction

* listen to a junior officer who is fresh out of college tell you how to do your job better even though you are the subject matter expert longer than they have been alive

* or, show up to formation four hours early when formation doesn't start until 0800 because the Colonel said be there 15 minutes early, so the battalion commander said be there at 0700, so the Company commander said be there at 0630, so the Platoon Commander said be there at 0600, so the Platoon Sergeant said be there at 0415,

then the military might not be for you"
Gas leak. Active shooter. Active abduction. Death threat. Bomb threat. 
This is the best poop story ever.

"Come on OP. Relive your trauma for our entertainment, maybe someone will gild you."
Why do cats like to sit in toilets? 
"I‚Äôm not OP, but I have lived across the street from a large, tall-grass field (and near cane fields):

Certain types of spiders like to find their homes in grass and grass-adjacent fields, because they provide good cover from predators and themselves have a lot of food.  The problem is, when these fields flood over in heavy rains, the spiders have to find shelter from the rain.  And if you live next to that field, your shelter is their shelter.

We had cane spiders, which are a totally harmless, but large and very fast spider, in that field.  Whenever the fields would flood, they‚Äôd flee in droves, and it wasn‚Äôt uncommon to just find several large spiders in unexpected places all at once during a flood.  On the wall, inside your bath towel, crawling up your neck when you sleep...

Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if OP has experienced similar, but being that it‚Äôs Australia, with much more terrifying spiders."
Aha... knew someone would say that! 
"Part of the problem in an increasingly paranoid society is that humor becomes a crime. I took a picture of an actual sign in an actual airport that said, ""Making jokes in this line may be a serious crime."" OWTTE.

I couldn't even point out that TSA is the biggest joke, and they're right there in line, because I didn't want to get arrested."
I doubt the receptionist is a mandatory reporter.
Oh I doubt that. This is second time in 2 weeks she did this. This kind of people hardly accept their own mistakes. She is probably blaming it on everyone but herself. 
Is she single?

How high are you right now?
Getting high while in the military while stationed on a base is 10000% a bad thing to happen to you.  
"I took my son when he was about 3 years old to Home Depot when I had to buy some supplies.  I was getting metal mesh fencing in a roll, a few 2x4's, and a box of nails.

I made a joke to the cashier that I was building my son a new playpen in the backyard.  I got a really weird look, but no call to the police."
Oh I feel this 
"I've been okay in the past but I'm definitely investing in some lube for my lady bits, once I heal."
Definitely a moderator on Reddit.
That lip gloss sounds like cruel and unusual punishment
Jumping a fence almost never ends well
