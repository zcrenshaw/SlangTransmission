"Similar to this my uncle's family name is Black and ours is White. It's a large family. One day we were at a large public pool with many kids from both sides. The adults were trying to get the kids out of the pool for pictures. First it was all of them, then the whole family, then they wanted to do just the Black family and then the White family. For context we're all white and for that matter the Black family are a bunch of blondes and redheads. Anyways, one of the parents was trying to get the most responsible preteen to go get the other side of the family for pictures. She ran to the pool and screamed ""all the Black kids have to get out of the pool so the White kids can get in!"" There was no music but I just imagined a record screech and the whole place stopped and stared at this seemingly horrible little racist girl. Follow that up by my uncle following black folks who were there around with his ID trying to explain. Hindsight it was hilarious but at that moment it felt real wrong."

"Reminds me of my childhood, me and my older brother would go to the garage (Not connected to the house) to smoke and play pool.

It was a double garage with a few couches, a pool table, our pedal bikes and a spare fridge/freezer for overflow food that wouldn't fit in the kitchen fridge.

We smoked in that garage every day for years, probably 4-5 years. Always thinking we were so clever. ""The cracks above the garage door must let all the smoke get out, we've never been caught"".

We were at a family event recently and talking about how clever we were smoking in the garage and how we never got caught, in front of my Mum and Stepdad. She looked me dead in the eye and said ""Do you think I'm a moron? Of course we knew you smoked weed in the garage, but it's better than smoking weed in the house. Do you think I've never smoked weed before?"""

What OP actually did:

* Open up the android 'find my devices' page, select wife's device, clicked on 'erase device', ignored the 'All data will be permanently deleted from this device.' message and then clicked again on 'erase device'.

"When I was young I used to get Candy Cigarettes from the Ice Cream man. I'd share them with my sister who was 3 years old.   
At one point my mom took them from is because she was getting ready to feed us lunch and she was going to give them back after we ate.   
My sister was NOT happy about this, started throwing a fit.
While having this fit, a woman from our church called because my mom was going to help out with vacation bible school.  The entire time my mom was on the phone, my 3 year old sister kept screaming ""I want my cigarettes!!!""."
So bizarre. Today I purposely listened to that song for the first time in at least a decade.

Perhaps convince her what she has now is all she needs, better than perhaps anything you'd have together.   


If you think your friends marriage is likely headed south/has been for a while, and you truly believe its beyond salvaging, perhaps pulling your friend aside is the right thing. I don't see how he could be mad at you unless there are underlying factors.

"Something similar happened to me (only worse). When I first met my wife, we attended a wedding and shared a room with her sister and her sisters boyfriend. We got blackout drunk at the wedding. That night I guess I went to use the bathroom and came back and got in bed and was kind of horny. 

After feeling her up and down for a minute or two (t-shirt, panties, and no bra) I realized her tits felt huge. I hardly knew where I was at this point. Anyway, I kept rubbing on her boobs and working my way below until I realized there was no way her tits were all of a sudden that big and I had got into the other bed with her sister. The boyfriend had either passed out, or rolled out into the floor.

About a week later I had the haunting feeling that she could have been awake and thought I was molesting her and just didn‚Äôt say anything.  The next time I saw her sister, I had to confess just in case. Luckily she found it funny and didn‚Äôt remember any of it. I was, and still still am, humiliated."

THIS_GUYS_A_PHONY's journal: 

First mold: Modeled after own dick.  Disappointed.  New mold needed.

Second mold: Went big.  Maybe too big?  There is no way you can hide a 28 inch crayon dick.  Put this one in it's own special hiding spot, back to the lab again on the mold.

3rd mold: 28/2 = 14.  14 inch.  This one was in purple.  I liked the length of it but something was wrong with the girth.  Was it too wide?  Maybe?  A color change might fix that.  Do they say black slims?  Maybe I'll make a black one.

4th mold: I made a black purple and cream colored 14 inch before I decided that the mold was indeed too wide.  Going back to the drawing board, I shrunk the size of the mold, but it came with a slightly smaller size in the end and the mold was about 11 inches.  O well, the size seemed fine still.  Having done multiple colors seemed to help me determine if I liked the mold or not, so I decided to just go make 5 or 6 shades of this one.  

5th mold:  I don't know why, but I google searched dildo lengths while I was waiting for the molds to set.  Turns out, most people prefer dildos in the 6-9 inch range?  So, maybe I just... you know...make a mold for each of those?  6,7,8,9?  Do a few color for each?

10th mold: Okay, so I did those 4 molds and I made a few colors for each, but then I was like ""if feet are good enough for half inches, so are dicks.""  

15th mold: I just did a 6.9 inch mold for..reasons.  I'll be back after I maybe take the dog for a walk.  Oh shit, I need to get my hot pocket don't I."

He didn't wanna lose the load
"Ok now. Because he sent me the post i have to interject on some mistakes here! First I LOVED that vacuum because I put the order in at Home Depot all he had to do was pick it up. Second my other gifts was 10 pack of make up wipes, and the the dick mold! The dick mold was created on Christmas Day through laughing and confusion as to how this was a good Christmas present! He‚Äôs a fantastic husband but not a great gift giver. I also refuse to use the creation its just strange and not my thing"
SO THAT WAS YOUR CONDOM I FOUND ON THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY THE OTHER DAY!!!! Do you want it back?
Ask her if it hurt when she fell from the sky
Sounds more like a fucked windsock if it was already used.
"Yeah fuck her lol. Tells you to do something then does that. Insecure as hell, you're better off without that for sure."
The Craigslist ad said ‚Äúcozy‚Äù and ‚Äúunique‚Äù. That‚Äôs code for cramped and smells bad.
After many years you hand her the toaster while you have something she really wants behind your back ;)
Yep it's rude AF to put a call on speaker when the other party doesn't know.

A) Telling your friends about it over a group chat was stupid, never write anything down that might get you in serious trouble.

B) Agreeing to take a picture was beyond stupid, it's none of their damn business.

C) Taking a picture, while right next to her, was, like, a level of stupid I have a hard time coping with. I mean, can you like tie your own shoes or do you have to wear the velcro kind?

D) The smartest thing you did was say ""I was taking a selfie!"", I'm honestly kid of stunned you came up with such a good excuse so quickly... but then you totally fucked it up by not following it up with ""but the camera was facing the wrong way when I did it on accident"".

Hopefully you will have a serious workplace injury in the next few minutes before that woman calls HR so you have an excuse to leave the building. Losing a finger might be worth it."
