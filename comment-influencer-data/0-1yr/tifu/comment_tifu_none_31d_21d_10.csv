"Then the next day start shouting ""HEY I'LL HIT HER!"""
You should follow it up tomorrow at the buffet by telling everyone that you hate juice...
"Orange, red, green, yellow.... doesn't matter.  ALL juice!

Hold up, phone's ringing....""oh hey, Satan."""
"""Have you seen Kyle? He's about this tall"""
"Don't need to guess, just sort them.
By flavour, by colour... By concentration..."
That‘s actually a pretty common joke in germany
Reddit never dissapoints.
"Don’t even need to see them, you can hear them a mile away. Americans speak quite loudly"
"No shit. Translation: Rich people are skiddish, so you have to behave a certain way around them. Fuck that!"
"And those looks were merely ""Yep, American"" confirmation glances lol"
"I'm having meta cringe over here. This guy somehow made the connection of ""our switch"" sounding vaguely like ""Auschwitz"" and then concocted a whole fantasy scenario based around that.

Then thousands of people upvoted it."
You’d love it if the juice bar was sorted by concentration.
"Are you 26 or 12? They are just tits, calm down."
And America
Bring back the third rake.
"*somehow gets burned juice served*

“HOW ON EARTH DO YOU BURN JUICE?!”"
We’re going to need to see those pictures...just to see how traumatic it was for you.
I'd assume the yelling in a restaurant part is what would elicit mildly disapproving stares.
Lives over there
"Wait, so you and your kids yelling in a public restaurant was ok because it's a buffet (which in your mind makes it ok), but it was just a fuck up because you were yelling something that only vaguely sounded like Auschwitz, if the other person was hard of hearing?

Yeah, YTA. Oh, wait, this isn't r/AmITheAsshole, is it... (And yes, I'm on mobile.)"
"Have you ever been to a buffet?

Shit's lawless."
"""Mom I got this great idea for a Reddit post!""

""That's great honey now eat your tendies before they get cold"""
"who the fuck just starts chanting nonsense at children in public

like regardless of the ""misunderstanding"" aspect (that's basically a bad pun he needed a story to justify, the entire situation would be extremely awkward and embarrassing"
"Man, I did NAZI that coming."
Americans yelling in a European restaurant?  Nothing annoying about that.  /s
"English is such a weird language. To a non-native like me, those two words look like their pronunciations should be the other way around."
Apparently that's alright in a buffet?
and I was just gonna say /r/jokes since this is...
"&gt; dissapoints

YW :)"
"Yo, Han! Bath?"
"is the au more or a ""ow"" or and ""awe""?"
Your English is just fine. That dude's just being a douche.

Did the surgeon do a good job?
"Probably got a few looks because you were yelling louder and louder, not because our switch sounds vaguely like auschwitz"
"And Denmark, but it's different when Germans say it because it's a very sensitive subject there"
"one of my favorite memories was tent camping in the Hamptons and strolling into a seafood shop to get some stuff to cook.

i still delight in the looks that i got, getting out of my beater car filthy, stinking, and hungover, and buying the same things that people in 5-figure outfits were."
That escalated quickly
People most likely just thought you were being loud.
"As an American ex-pat, I'm cringing, not gonna lie lol. Why would being in a buffet make it okay to shout?"
"Yup. He thinks he is being clever, but anyone with half a brain can tell this story is BS. The conversation simply doesn't make sense, and its pretty obvious the entire story is completely fabricated."
This literally did not happen.
"Sure thing, Chewie!"
"I don't know what's worse, these new imaginary tifus or the sex tifus from some time ago."
We blame them for starting you.
"Lmao he needs to say ""hate juice"" ^hate ^jews



And


Hey i'll hit her ^heil ^hitler"
"I was 14 and went to my first dance. It was the end of my period and i didnt want to wear a pad but my mom only had super tampons. I used it and went, and got extremely dehydrated. No alcohol, no drugs, very pg. 

On the way back home with my boyfriend at the time, i was feeling nauseas and dizzy. We got back to my place and i went to the bathroom and took out the tampon. I didnt realize the problem was the tampon at this point, soon after that i threw up. 

I figured it was the flu until i noticed the rash. A massive, sunburn-like rash that spread from my thighs to my betty button, everywhere. It felt exactly like a sunburn, it was beyond uncomfortable. 

Once we noticed the rash we called the health hotline and asked about it, the girl asked me a few questions and ends up asking about my period and if i used tampons or pads, how long i had them in, etc, i didnt think anything of it. Eventually she says that if it gets worse, to go to emergency, until then just drink lots of water to flush out my system, says something about fruit. I didnt know what 'worse' meant so i ignored the discomfort and went to sleep, as i was exhausted. Didnt drink much water, if any. 

To be honest i dont remember the timeline of the next bit after this because i was pretty out of it, but i did end up going to the doctor as i had developed a UTI, and the 'sunburn' was a light chemical burn. My skin peeled *everywhere*. It itched, it burned. I spent a few nights literally crying myself to sleep while vigorously scratching my crotch and surrounding areas, trying to find relief so i could sleep but making my skin even more raw than it already felt. I had to go on medication and antibiotics and then found out a type of antibiotic totally annihilates me. I was just not okay for a good 3-4 weeks. 

I still didnt know it was TSS until right after, when i got my next period, and i looked at that little folded up pamphlet thing in tampon boxes and read about TSS and i had had every single symptom and suddenly it all clicked.

Deeply sorry for the novel, didnt realize how long it would take to explain that lol

Edit: i should add that i did talk to my doctor about it before i claimed it was TSS"
I mean he did suck on them once upon a time .
"Beer expands in the freezer too! Don't worry friend, you're not the only one to figure this out the hard way"

"She's entitled anyway, fuck her.

Nothing wrong with a fetish. It doesn't dehumanize a person if you treat them like a person."
I love this thread so very very much
I'm sure this definitely happened.
This is a valid plot for an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm.
"I think you mean ""ring bear""."
"Ou-shh-vits

Yes, we do."
The real test would have been to start saying louder and louder Mauthausen...
"Definitely more like ""ow"" but still slightly different."
I hate the juice there too
"Knees weak, arms are heavy..."
"Austrian here. Dont worry I doubt anyone felt like you were yelling Auschwitz. You can clearly tell if someone speaks english so nobody would have though about an oddly pronounced ""Auschwitz"".

You pronounce it like this:   
The AU is pronouced quiet literally, like ""Australia"" (not with what sound like an O like in Auckland or Aunt). It basically souds like the ""o / ou"" in ""cow"", ""loud"" or ""south"".  
The SCH is pronounced like the SH in words like ""shield"", ""ship"" or ""shiver"". Like the sound you make when your kids should be quiet.  
WITZ is pronounced like ""TS"". It sounds similar like in ""switzerland"". I say similar because it will sound a bit off since your last vocal was ""SCH"". 

Maybe its easier for you if you write it like this: Aushwits

I dont know if the makes any sense but that my best try. May I ask where in Austria are right now?"
I just can't get over the part where you say english is your first language. If you're typing in english why specify
Keep us updated
"Wtf are you, 15? How could you possibly only just be realising that."
"This made me so uncomfortable, like being inside a hot oven"
I vote you show up with a +1 anyways
"I cannot speak for him but I believe the ending would actually set the two words apart. The ""z"" sound in German is very strong, the German ""-witz"" and English ""-witch"" should be fairly different.

Source: I have been studying German for a few years but it's not my mother tongue so I may be wrong."
"Same. I was driving me and my wife back home from our honeymoon and I was so exhausted we pulled over on the side of a major highway and I took a nap. It’s what my parents always taught me to do, especially my dad, who spent most of his years as a touring musician and had literally fallen asleep at the wheel several times. The nap didn’t help much, but it got us home to our bed without incident, and that’s the important part."
"Austian here, ""our switch"" doesnt sound like Auschwitz at all imo, but that you were yelling and not stopping ""because it's an Buffet Restaurant, that's okay"" is the cringy part about that

Edit: clarification"
"Another Austrian here. We speak English, most of us fairly fluently. The people probably understood you just fine unless your guys' mouthes were full of half-chewed food. It's just really rude to yell in a restaurant, even a less formal one. I can't hear how people would believe you yelled Auschwitz, except for other non-German speakers who woldn't know how we say it."
TIFU is straight up self fan-fic these days
"Totally agree, yelling in a restaurant is disrespectful and proof of heavy tourist entitlement."
"Yeah, I was fussing at my partner and he pointed out that since it’s a public hospital, there’s a lot of people struggling with drugs around here and to take it less personally. (He’s great for putting stuff into perspective)"
"He just called your wife, ""hard of hearing"", what are you gonna do?"
"That's

a) made up  
b) lame   
and c) they don't even sound the same - see a and b."
Not juice. THE juice.
It’s Ow like when you hurts yourself and say ow that hurts
"*replies with my length*

*hears the whole call center laughing*"
Although they were probably glaring at you for being loud anyway.
Yeah! My Mom too!!! I didn't learn how to use tampons until adulthood.
"&gt; I've heard my uncle and wife having sex


Smh I hate it when this happens"
"I'm not a native German speaker, but I speak the language reasonably well. I seriously, seriously doubt anyone in the restaurant thought you were saying ""Auschwitz"", even if they thought you were butchering the pronunciation. It simply sounds too different. It would be like comparing ""Johann Bach"" with ""your hand bath"". Like, yeah, they are vaguely similar, but no one is going to mistake the two."
Shoulda said nintendo :/
"It only sounds like the american pronunciation of Auschwitz. German pronunciation is more ""Aus-chwitz"""
Team Yen.
... and then everyone in the restaurant clapped
Yeah. Most english speakers butcher it quite badly. But then again we overestimate how much people care about stuff like this anyway. I wouldn't worry too much.
"We were all too concerned, and we were about 24 at the time, past what I would consider ""college bro's"" age. After about an hour he passed out and we spent the next two hours watching Netflix while he slept on the couch so we could make sure he was always breathing and wouldn't vomit and choke. Once he ""settled down"" he was pretty tame, just kept a bucket by him to throw up in, and every time he threw up we made sure he got some water in him. We had decided that if the hectic phase persisted much longer we would call 911... it really is better safe than sorry, but aside from the awkward/gross factor we all felt like we had it under control since we knew to keep him well hydrated. But calling 911 was definitely on our minds."
Time to end my life. :D
"I'm reading this while taking a shit and my butt hole clinched so tight Because of the cringe, my asshole essentially became a playto shaper"

"Ha, virgin!"
"Just try not yelling at all next time. It's a restaurant, not the barn where you were raised."
Nope. I actually got no sexual pleasure outta that but looked every once in awhile just because. Its facinating
That's so bad
Lol they weren't looking at you guys bc it sounded like aushwitz. they were looking at you bc you weee yelling IN A RESTAURANT. In what world is it suddenly okay to yell in a restaurant just bc it's a buffet?
It’s funny because Witz is German for joke.
"Exactly, you can actually die from this shit."
My guess: Buffets are low-class in the US. But they are pretty normal in DE.
Britain is the America of Europe.
Great fuck up! And it's even from this day.
No not at all. Like this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vincent_willem_van_gogh.ogg

"How am I being prejudiced? I recognize and acknowledge that everyone, women included, should be aware of their surroundings and how situations and actions can be interpreted. I'm saying that the person in the situation who has the ability to defuse any potential stress in the situation should be aware enough to do so. If I'm in an alley or on a trail and I come up on someone, I make my presence known by making noise or saying ""excuse me"" or ""behind"" or something like that. Normal trail etiquette, that also happens to make navigating around people in tiny back alleys easier. But in this particular case, we're talking about men and women, and how men can be completely unaware of how threatening they can appear, especially in remote areas where it's just them and a woman. So that's what I focused on. But if you look at my earlier comments, you'll notice that I agree everyone should be aware and should know basic self-defense."

Maybe if we saw them we could help you with the problem.
"&gt;Isn't it also illegal in Germany?

Yes, doing the nazi salute is illegal and if some police officers see and they aren't busy right now and willing to do the paperwork, you will get in trouble. And its pretty rude actually. 

&gt;Plus the whole nazi pug thing... That was the UK, but Europe seems to take that kind of thing seriously.

I'm not sure if the conviction for a hate crime was really necessary in that case. Imo it was pretty harmless compared to shit some people e.g. post about immigrants (like calling for witch hunting against refugees). Thankfully, more and more people are suffering consequences for posting this horrible shit."
"Yes, I did nazi that coming."
"Yeah, I mean as devastating as 9/11 was, flooding our nation in fear and spawning 2 wars, the actual attack resulted in the death of 2,996 people (on the day). The Holocaust was a genocide. It was the attempted extermination of an entire people, which resulted in the death of about 11 million people, including 6 million jews. I am an American who was in my late teens during 9/11, but there is really no comparison between the two events... Not that anyone was really comparing them.

I really cannot express how disappointed I am that there are people with Internet access who have never heard of the holocaust."

"Lol, pretty much what I was thinking."
I doubt anyone thinks you were yelling auschwitz. It wouldnt make sense in any context except for some fucked up trivia game

How convenient that this happened in Austria.
Stop yelling in restaurants

"I'm a mom of 5, it's pretty common to be bigger and to get bigger faster in subsequent pregnancies. Your muscles give way sooner because they've done it before. It's nothing to worry about. It might make her feel better to pass that along. It caught me off guard when I was pregnant with my second kiddo too. That said, pregnancy is hard. You're physically pretty miserable, your body is expanding and it's all out of your control, your hormones are completely out of whack. It has its good points sure but as a whole, it's not a good time. Don't take it personally OP. You've done this before, you know the drill. She'll come back to you eventually after baby is born."
Then you need a new vet!
"Actually, I would say it is harder to learn as a beginner from native speakers, because they have (unless trained) no intellectual knowledge of grammatical structure. Try asking a Gael when lenition blocks or jumps and they'll look at you like a fish grew out your head.  But, even fluent learners struggle to be fully idiomatic in the language.  In short, there's a lot going on.  

However, it is not any harder to learn than any other language.  The difficulties are the lack of speakers, the lack of opportunities to use it, and (often) distance, and in particular the lack of resources for post-beginners who want to work to fluency.  But if you want to have a go at it, it's perfectly doable.  The learngaelic.scot website is a good place to get a taste for it, and there's a /r/gaidhlig sub (of course)."
I’m disgusted. Would you be willing to mine me? I’m scared to look now and you’ve already seen the worst

"With my quite limited German, I can say with 99% certainty that ""Our Switch"" doesn't even resemble Auschwitz pronunciation.

Trust me it's jarring for some of us too...

Me being very dyslexic thought the menu said Gulag not goulash but I’ve dealt with dyslexia for years now and I just know it said goulash. The whole time the waiter was talking my friends order down I was thinking to my self “goulash not gulag, goulash not gulag, goulash not gulag.” When I ordered guess what I said? Yeah I said gulag. The waiter gave me a puzzled look so I thought he just didn’t hear me or something so I say Gulag louder, at this point the tables around me are looking... luckily my friend step in and ordered for me because I didn’t realize what I was saying until I thought about it."

"This reminds me of something I read about Eddie Money several decades ago.  Looked around and this was the only reference I could find to this exact thing:

&gt;  At a party one night back in 1980, after drinking heavily, the singer snorted a substance on a mirror that was being passed around the room. Money assumed it was cocaine, but it was really a synthetic barbiturate. He nodded off and spent the next 14 hours lying on his leg, severely damaging a nerve. The incident also brought temporary impairment of his kidney function.  

 [https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/money-eddie](https://www.encyclopedia.com/education/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/money-eddie) 

I remember in the original article I read that one of the things that bothered him, making him take a more assessing look at his life, was that this was at a party with a lot of people, some of whom were supposed to be his friends. But he sat there, passed out, for 14 hours and no one checked on him.  He got clean after that, but he had to learn how to walk again."

But honestly: I recon you are good. Even if people thought you were shouting Auschwitz (which I seriously doubt) as a people we have (mostly) worked through our past and come to terms with our history and the attrocities that happend. I really don't see people getting offended and jumping to false conclusions.

Anyways, enoy jour time in Austria."
I’m actually having lunch with my mom tomorrow and I’m already dreading it.  It’s gotten worse as she got older because of the false teeth.  Oh noooooooo...
"Isn't it also illegal in Germany? Before you downvote me, keep in mind some teenagers were recently arrested for taking a picture of themselves doing the nazi salute in Germany.

Plus the whole nazi pug thing... That was the UK, but Europe seems to take that kind of thing seriously."
Ouchwitz would have been a word in german if it wasn't for that damn hitler.
"Austrian here. Don't worry - people won't think you shouted Auschwitz, they'll just reckon you're the loud obnoxious Americans.
(Loud americans is a bit of a clichèe here, no offense)"
"English isn’t a language. It’s three language roots stacked under a trench coat that follows other languages into back ally’s and mugs them for loose grammar. 

English is a tough language, it can be understood through tough thorough thought though!"

"I’m a German living in Austria. I honestly had to chuckle a bit when I read this. Don’t worry, it does sound quite different and maybe the other people were only staring because you repeatedly said one phrase over and over in a loud tone."
This sounds like a Fawlty Towers episode.

Nah. Don’t buy it
"Why are you traumatised by this? You're a grown ass man (theoretically), they're just tits. The only reason for you to feel uncomfortable is if you sexualized your own mother's breasts. Which, if you did, means you have bigger issues than seeing the physical evidence that your mum is female."
"Hmm, still I think theres definitely a difference there. German speakers would notice the difference!"
Bank ladies are the best.
Sounds like your gf doesn’t let you put your balls on her face.

It was not anonymous as you had her username and to top it off you reposted allowing her to find it. Its a crappy thing to do and its shortsighted of you to not understand. If you were showing something you were proud off publicly, and then someone made it about laughing at your facial features and allowing people to find you/contact you personally, that you wouldn’t feel a little hurt."

20 mins after we got in we hear a door slam. They were back early. We panicked of course, immediately draining the tub but it was too late. They saw his car out front. We came out of their bedroom with wet hair and bubbles. 

My parents were also insanely strict Catholics. I feel for you. 

The verbal lashing he and I got was insane. This was in the late 1990’s.

"I was in this same predicament with an ex when I was a teenager. Except she lived in a single floor rancher/permanent mobile home? Basically it was small af.

My story didn't end as well as yours. My ex was an idiot and her parents/sister and others were still awake in this small ass house and I snuck in to spend the night thinking everyone was asleep. I ended up hiding in the closet while waiting for everyone to go to bed when I heard the most stomach turning sentence from her mother ""Let me grab some blankets out of EX's closet"". I heard the closet door knob start to turn and I impulsively grabbed it and pulled it shut which made her mom scream.

Rest of the night ended with my parents being called to pick me up. I sat in the closet with the hood from my hoodie covering my face and not saying a word while her mother freaked the hell out (rightfully so). Was literally the most embarrassing time of my life, and I learned a lot from it. Definitely never tried anything as stupid as that ever again."

If your parents couldn't explain, that's on them. I hope you'll explain to your kids.

Or maybe sex just really isn't that important to her. They're both disabled and get a lot more from the relationship than sexual intimacy. They support each other and care for each other. That's quite cruel to suggest that because their sex life isn't how you would like yours to be that they should cheat on each other.

"My mom did this. I had a girl spend the night in high school. My mom knocked on my closed door in the morning (we over slept) both of our hearts stopped looking each other in the eyes, we knew we were dead. Then she started to walk away and that pleasant feeling of relief poured over us. Not a word was spoken. Then she stopped and flipped around door still closed and goes “I set a place for C as well. You can take her home after breakfast”. We both were shaking scared. Mom was cool about it but dropped a huge bomb on us at breakfast. “I hope you guys had fun because dinner tonight won’t be. Her parents are coming over”. We thought the word was ending and even though we weren’t together we hid from our parents around the house all day.  At dinner that night both parents could see us disturbed. Finally they broke they were like you guys are fine. We knew you guys were doing stuff like this. Wear protection and don’t be stupid. We were relieved and realized how cool our parents were. They knew they couldn’t stop us so they made sure it was as safe as possible. They had long known we were having sex. Her mom caught us an hour after. That’s a story for another day but I’d love to share it if people are interested."

"We’re thinking that eventually his dad has to go pick up his mom for work or go out to the store, and I’ll just make my escape then. But dad would find it suspicious if my boyfriend were to ask when he plans on going to the store; etc, so we’re a bit screwed. But it’s a good idea to suggest father and son bonding that’ll be used a distraction lmao"
I felt this post while reading.
"You only feel bad cos you got caught, you were happy being a bit of a bitch until then. You are honestly missing the point I have tried making and are instead making it a self pity party. The only ignorant person is you, all happy to laugh at someone and then become a sour patch child when people aren’t all laughing alongside you. You have made yourself look like a pretty nasty women all on your own, with most people in the badeyebrows sub thinking the girl looked pretty cute and only needed a bit extra practice. You are a bully who grew up, got a job, dyed their hair neon orange and enjoys dragging women online for your own amusement. I’m all done here and frankly all the backlash and hate you got for acting so catty speaks for itself, if the only people defending you find dumb categorising like ‘snowflakes’ a strong or engaging argument then have fun, y’all deserve each-other."
"In all fairness, you don’t leave a 6 year old in a hotel alone for an hour. That’s just bad parenting."
I know a single mother with a 9 yo son. She has so many stories about stupid stuff he has done to/with his dick.
It's one big pillow the length of 2 king bed pillows. I have 3 because. It just seems to be a thing as a women when you get older to steadily add more pillows to your bed. I'm up to 7 lol
Am female and cringed *so hard* at this...
"I entirely agree. He has taken charge of his situation and as I said, he works and is in the process of getting his foot out the door/ moving out as soon as humanly possible. Just as of now he’s stuck in this toxic predicament, that isn’t fair to our relationship and especially isn’t fair to him. I also am taking steps to move out and assist anyway I can, because it’s important that I do as it is my relationship and I want to. But I acknowledge we aren’t children and the situation definitely is not an excuse to act like we are.  In short; getting our shit together."
Thanks! I like her.
I tried to gas myself in my car that had a catalytic converter. Sat in there for an hour with my foot on the gas. I'm glad we both failed.
"And people say they wasted that match up on a Nitro...

You took them to the big leagues!! 😂"

Parents like that are why kids join the army and elope.
Pls no
"I’m not part of this, leave me alone."
Good to know!
Girl threw it back so hard she broke a mans back. Dayum.
Very possible. I know when I tell this story at work everybody finds it hilarious
Thank God it wasn't a Thor action figure with a magnetic mjolnir.
I'm imagining Thoreau looking down from the sky in confusion and wonder.
"That could have gone really, really badly."
"Life is tough, so I wish you both the best of luck. Obviously focus on your futures too. No need to go full time both of you. Maybe move in together and beforehand agree if the relationship doesn't work out - you two should still be cordial roomates. I mean i did a situation like this with an ex roomate. Sometimes its easier to move in as a couple even if its not serious and save money than it is trying to find suitable roommates (a nightmare on its own)"
"This happened to my high school boyfriend and I. My dad came home from work early and was just pottering around downstairs while my boyfriend was shitting himself in my room, terrified my dad would catch him. I tried to act natural with my dad, asked him what he was up to, how his day was going, all the normal things a teen would ask her dad. Eventually my dad went into the backyard to water his plants and my boyfriend flew down the stairs and out the door. I found out a few months later that my dad knew he was there all along and stuck around home (later than his lunch hour) just to mess with me"
"Gotcha. Yeah any antihistamine is likely going to work for you, and Zyrtec is the best of the non-drowsy class in my opinion. Benadryl (diphenhydramine) is recommended to have on hand for people that have allergic reactions (even for serious reactions in addition to their epinephrine injections) but it does make you sleepy and that sucks. Good for you though, a lot of people have a med for every little thing."
