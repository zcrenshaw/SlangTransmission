"*Pharmacist hands back phone*

""Here you go ma'am, thanks for the tip."""
I would never let high me be in charge of my girlfriends parents first impression 
It's okay if the prescription was for Viagra.  
You could have played it cool and pretended not to know what a taco is.
Don't even have to read the description on this one. 
"To be fair: if I were your wife and you had done that, I would‚Äôve said the same exact thing to you. "
I thought this was the case. That she was just trying to be funny. When she we opened the picture and started laughing with tears. I knew she was being honest. 
"Watch out, they have people dedicated to watching scientology related posts on reddit. They 100% know you've posted this so you should be careful :X "
"Just say you made a mistake and then edit the rest of the paper EXCEPT the last paragraph 

edit: WOW! Thanks for the gold kindest stranger, may you write excellent papers"
Did you dab after she said yes? Or would that be attempted homicide?
I can't believe you let it go THAT far. I would've eventually just given up told the truth
"&gt;If you ever have a crush on them, fucking dab on them

Top all time r/lifeprotips material right there"
"Even though the police suspected you of murder at first, at least the thief didn‚Äôt break into your car! Those mannequin limbs saved your wallet! "
If a towels on the floor. Assume the worst. Especially for your face 
"I was about to but she stopped me. Another day, dab. Another day. "
What tickles me about this is that both you and your wife are scarred for life but your daughter will in no way be adversely affected by the incident :D
I wonder if the pharmacist even noticed it was a dick pic. Lol
Maybe the vibrator helped close the deal.
I know the feeling. I took mine a year ago on 23 and me and ancestry because both grandmas on my mom and dad‚Äôs side were adopted. About a month ago I get an email saying I have a new relative match. Come to find out my dad that raised me isn‚Äôt my biological dad. That was an awkward call asking my mom if she knew the guy. 
Plot twist: the manager knew you were lying and wanted to teach you a lesson / make you admit it.

"You were the one that opened the garage door, but you were tripping on CO and can't remember it."
"Step 1: Get out of the bathtub.

Step 2: Upper deck the toilet.

Step 3: Collect your clothes.

Step 4: Walk in the living room.

Step 5: Get dressed in this order.  Socks, shirt, shoes, underwear, pants.  Make sure eye contact is established with the friends.

Step 6: (Optional) Slap your ex on the behind and loudly proclaim how nice a cup of coffee would be.

Step 7:  Offer to treat anyone who wants to go out to pancakes.  Drive separately.  If any takers, don't show up."
"Oh she knew him.


Edit: Thank you for my first gold!!"
"So first when the taco became on my plate, I acted very interesting. I showed an expression on my face so as to seem that I was confused, astounded but in a restrained way, curious, and interested. They did notice, and seemed confused, but did not remark. So I asked ""This looks very interesting. What is this?""

They stared at me and the mother said ""It's a beef taco."" And I was saying ""Oh, interesting, a beef...what is it again?""

And she was like ""A taco.""

And I was like ""A 'taco', oh interesting. Never heard of a taco, looks pretty good."""
"Pharmacist: Hmm, I don't think we have enough supply to fix that..."
"Nice going with the pockets, though. "
"My sister and I found a secret cousin through 23 and me. When we brought it up with our dad (the cousin was his sister‚Äôs son) he copped to knowing about it, but the kid he knew about was another new cousin from my other aunt. Can of worms..."
When the title is the TL;DR
Fuck scientology.
"Meh.. Could be worse, at least they're already divorced! "
How is it the friends fault that you slipped? Worse case scenario he thought you‚Äôd embarrass yourself a little. 
"The $500 for visiting A&amp;E is sort of karma for lying about having an allergy. Next time, just say that you hate onions, not have an allergy to them."
"Ouch, give OP the benefit of the doubt I'm sure it was VERY noticeable. "
"Should have just told them that until marriage, the meat stays out of the taco. "
"""I mean I smoked a lot of damn weed with my roommate before leaving because my nerves were getting to me since this was my first time meeting her parents.""

This is the most backwards ass logic I've seen in a long time. 

edit: I'm a pothead myself, and I've definitely made the same mistake of smoking before you have to do important shit and it blowing up in your face.

But it's never been a problem stemming from logic, more the lack there of.

"If you do continue to use Facebook, hopefully you‚Äôve at least learned to make your contact list, and everything private. 
And to not have any identifiable pictures as your cover or profile pic. 
Awesome parents though!"
"I've had that clock for about 10 years now (Phllips), but have never used the birdsongs. If we have the same model, you can also have radio, frogs (who thought of that???), waves and bips.

The best advice I can give you is to cut the sound. I used the bipping sounds at first but it's been years since I completely turned the sound off, it only silently lights up now. Best thing ever, It wakes me gently and always a bit before the set time."
"Just a heads up on the Kik camera ""live picture"" thing: there's an extension that you can install on your phone that allows you to use any saved pictures as a ""live"" picture, so always ask for verification.

Source: I fell for it before."
"If this uncle Pete's like me, he loves his nephew but realizes he got his parents genes, and isn't the brightest crayon, so he'll roll with it. 

Edit: Thank you kind person for the Gold, glad to make your shitty day better!! "
I could never imagine a vibrator being publicly gifted in any office I ever worked at.  Carol from HR would be involved immediately.
"Haha, your two year old will not remember.

I once forgot mine in the shower, and didn't remember until my ten year old said he's not gonna shower until I took my penis out of there. He's thirteen now, and I'm still being reminded and apologizing. "
"Friendly reminder: live pics on kik can be faked. 

Op, glad you got out relatively unscathed. This was a good lesson in cyber security. "
Maybe he was trying to set a precedent. If he's always like that they will just think he's a fucking idiot as opposed to thinking he's high all the time.

"true, but we are all very close, everyone spends time together including step moms and dads, at least before my father in law found out his wife lied for 36 years and knowingly forced him to raise a child that wasn‚Äôt biologically his."
"I am in awe of your ability to sleep during that experience. 

Ptsd for a few weeks is completely reasonable, as is wearing surgical masks outside until the day you die."
"Eh nudes happen. 

On the other hand you have wire fraud and extortion on the person that tried to blackmail you.

That's much better. "
"Dude, I highly doubt the paramedics looked at you in disgust.  9/10 times paramedics are extremely professional and know you can up and shit yourself.  I know what its like to think all eyes are on you with the worst thoughts behind them, but that's always untrue in most social standards. 

Guarantee they're mostly concerned about the dude that got hit in the head with the force of 10 moons.  Answer your calls, go outside, look people in the face and smile sheepishly, tell the girl you were trying to greet her with enthusiasm and a chipper attitude last time and that you'll try again.  Smile!  No one cares aside from caring that you're okay."

Dab Another Day is the best Bond film.
"Please don't convert your frustation into hate, or at least don't make it to a friend. Thats how insecure people end up alone"
"Dude just get up and leave. What's your ex gonna do, break up with you? "
"How hard it is to leave my friends, how awkward it must be

they know that i'm not doing well, and mean the best for me

and then there comes a time they write a card, their thoughts relay

it's hard for them to come up with the perfect words to say...

""*Good luck wherever you end up  - a shame to see you go*""

No truer words were spoken, but i know He didn't know 

I wasn't coming back again, but that's the way it goes...

It made me smile the way he said '...*these things happen, I spose*...

'*You had a decent run!'* i did indeed - i thank you, bub

so raise a glass to me, my friends - I'll *'See you at the pub!'*"
I think that all college students are familiar with the too-tired-to-think-but-writing-a-paper-anyway phenomenon. It can produce some pretty crazy results. Just be honest with your professor because that it was two am insomnia fueled hysteria
biblically.
this thread is marked as small
"Honestly I feel like saying ""could we please get some fresh guac?"" Would get you some fresh guac if you were nice about it. My favorite sushi place, they'll give you the standard wasabi from powder. If you ask for fresh wasabi, they'll grind and mix it for you."
"Having lurked/read TIFUs passively for the past several years, I can honestly say this one was the worst single event that I've ever read.

I'll start praying for you."
Godammit this is the meme where I got that idea from. 
There's a reason they stopped doing personal DNA tests in high school and early college. The number of people finding out that dad wasn't bio was pretty rough. 
That is sitcom levels of misfortune.
Why is that your friends fault at all?
I'm going to hell for laughing.. Really hope she could figure out it being a misunderstanding or at least took it as a joke.. 
The embarrassing part is that you put 4 months of effort into a girl you've never spoken to... 
"A+ reading. You're still the asshole, though. Hahahaha"
The paper needs a re-reich
"I wonder how many people have done something similar and accidently died.

If you would have died, everyone you know would have assumed you committed suicide. Even though that was clearly not your intent, only you would have known what actually happened.

Crazy."
I think the part where you fucked up is where you assumed using a towel you found on the floor to wipe your face was a good idea.
"I‚Äôd save it for the first time she says the inevitable ‚Äú I HATE YOU!‚Äù....,....‚ÄùYeah? Well..,,.this one time when you were two...‚Äù"

Leave Scientology. Never try to press charges for the break in. Consider a relatively 'cheap' exit to be your ticket to a better future. Fuck Scientology. Fuck them. 
"I took a photo of a sex part flyer that was scattered around my college, this one was on top of the urinal. I sent it to my school friends and posted it on my snap story. Months later I was going through my photos and found it. You could see my pissing dick in the reflection of the metal pipe above urinal.

"Dude, they broke into your house and you think it's far fetched that they monitor popular websites for Scientology content?"
"No no, don't do that, have you never heard you shouldn't stick your dick in crazy?"
"So you mean to tell me that 13 days ago you ask how to get these ppl to stop sending you ‚Äútickets‚Äù. Now 3 days after that you post a picture of a contract you signed. Which a picture of a blank one of those contracts can be found online with the same copy lines through them mid-page like in your picture. Then 4 days after that they say your special n instantly ship you to New York for 5 days. While there, they broke into your house, opened some drawers, threw a auxiliary cord behind a table and some candles on the floor. You expect people to believe this? What high to get by fabricating stories to ppl online?"
"Yep! Same clock. I guess they changed the sounds at some point because mine does birdsong, birdsong with music, waves, forest waterfall (I think?) and piano. I may have to try the silent alarm next time I'm on break, see if it works for me. I'm glad to hear you've had yours for 10 years, I didn't know how long it would last that's awesome!"
"Yeah right, how do you really expect me to believe that you're *not* the bug posting this after burrowing into OP's brain and controlling his body like a marionette puppet while he watches on helplessly trapped in his own body?"
Ooooooh tastes very strange!
"I accidentally called a director for a tv production company I was an intern at whilst I was masturbating once.

"Every year at my work we play Dirty Santa at the holiday party.  One year, before my time acctually, a woman who was new at work thought it meant you brought something dirty for the gift swap.  She brough in a collection of flavored lubes.  She still works there, and to this day, every year at the holiday party we discuss the year she brought the flavored lubes.  She still works there, and can take a joke about it.  But this marks ten years for me, and like I said it happened before my time, so this poort woman has been getting this story told for a long time now."
"Oh god....why is Carol such a quintessentially HR name?

Congratulations you just got a new roommate/friendbwho edited the paper without your knowledge. Stress how you should've double-checked your paper before turning it in and apologize that you didn't 
Make sure you post part 2.
"Kids are terrible at choosing presents, i'm sure uncle Pete isn't expecting anything more. XD"
"I'm a fucking slob and you'd have to dig through fastfood/gas station food trash to touch the floorboard of my car. Every car on the street has been broken into (sometimes on the same day), except mine. 

All they'd find is hip hop and metal cassettes anyway, since my car doesn't even have a CD player. "
What if the op really is having an affair and being conniving by writing a Reddit post about how he's not having an affair... Would be a pretty interesting plot twist!
Hopefully uncle Pete has a sense of humor...or a cat.
"Honestly, dating co workers is usually fine as long as they aren't a subordinate and you're not a piece of shit. If you tend to have healthy relationships, it'll be fine. If you tend to have toxic relationships, you're probably gonna end up making your workplace toxic too. Just treat them with respect and if it ends, accept it like a gentleman and wish her the best. I mean, you should be doing that for any relationship though really."
Somehow I first thought you forgot your two year old in the shower. It makes more sense now.
He hid that in the pool

Exactly! It still freaks me out to this day at how close I was to not existing.
"They were just looking for any dirt. Drugs, corpses in the basement, cheese pizza on the computer, whatever blackmail they can find. "
Hi Karin!
"It‚Äôs not your fight. Hard to hear that, but you need to follow your wife‚Äôs lead on this. You‚Äôre not the one whose entire childhood got turned upside down and you‚Äôre not the one who gets to decide who does what because of it. 

Edit: holy shit, my first gold! They told me being mature paid off, but I didn‚Äôt think it would ever would!! Thank you kind stranger!

2nd Edit: OP, if you‚Äôre still reading, I just want to say that you did not destroy your wife‚Äôs family. The blame is not on you. I hope you are able to support your wife and also express yourself in a healthy way about this. You guys are in it for the long haul. This will get resolved one way or another, but ultimately your wife needs you on her side, whatever that may look like for her. This is the time to be more sensitive and doting if there ever was one."
"&gt; Sounds like the story is over.... not quite. Lisa put the vibrator in her glove box. A few days later her 8 year old son was rummaging around in her car, found it, turned it on and walked into her house rubbing it on his face saying: look Mom, I'm shaving!

Classic kid moment. "
"I have also done this while fucking my EX -GF.. however I called my co-worker/friend who apparently listened to the call for a good 5 minutes then promptly told the entire office about the call with scarily accurate sound recreations of my GF moaning.

"His concern is they function like the mafia. They will cause problems for you if you pursue it.

If you are broke with no financial means, you may want to take his advice. They could keep harassing you and causing you to lose jobs, apartments, or get expelled from college. The worst is they could plant drugs in your place or child porn on your computer and call the police on you.

If you have money or come from a family with money, then you'd have the resources to fight them.

Regardless, you should perform a thorough search of your apartment for anything left behind. Do a digital search of your computer for any illicit files they might have placed on it.

From what every Scientologist survivor has said, they are very bad people. They have no problem breaking the law to extract revenge."
"I love the karma here.

You were a more than decent and you did a solid for him. The $230 sucks but it is what it is. You should contact Uber and let them know the rider wasn‚Äôt you and you did a solid for a drunk guy. They might help on the cost and they should remove the ding.

"They call this a ""non-paternity event.""  They're actually not uncommon.  Even going back in families over time and generations.

Say two branches of a family just know they are related going back to the 1700's, each descended from two brothers.  Come to find out the wife of one of the two brothers would have been meeting with the 1700s milk man, because they're not genetically related at all.

People find out they are the children of their uncles or their grandfathers, not their fathers.  That kind of thing.

Humans get freaky with each other, and always have.  Ever so often some journalist writes an article about non-paternity events in the new science of family genetics - [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/07/who-s-your-daddy/305969/](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/07/who-s-your-daddy/305969/)

My reply was ""Lol go ahead, I don't even use FB anymore so my friends list is all old coworkers or family members that probably saw my dick when they were changing my diapers [this was a lie, I use Messenger a lot so most of my acquaintances are in my friends list]. Yeah I'd rather not have grandma wake up to my nudes but it's not worth $300 to avoid it.""


She was not happy with that response and sent a couple more texts like ""I'm about to send it! You better do what I asked, I'm sending it!"", I said ""look I gave you my answer. I couldnt send you the money if I wanted bc I don't have it, and if you don't stop harassing me I'm going to the police. I'm going to bed now ""Bridget"", do what you want.""

I went to bed half expecting to wake up with half of my relationships suddenly being made very awkward, but she never called my bluff üôå

"Since these DNA tests became popular there have been a lot of happy and a lot of very disappointed people. 

I am in my 60's and a couple of years ago decided to have my DNA tested. I did it for a couple of reasons. My parents hardly ever talked about their ancestors so I never really knew where anyone came from and I only ever knew my mother's parents. Another reason for the testing was because it's neat to find out your heritage and I actually did a family tree. I had no idea there were so many ancestors. Lastly, the other reason I did the test is because I have a sister who for years posted shit online that she is part Native American. For a long time she claimed she was Cherokee even becoming an administrator for our dad's side of the family on Ancestry.com and making this claim. She never had a DNA test done however. For the last several years my sister changed her story and posted on Plenty of Fish that she is a member of the Algonquin Indian tribe. I have no fucking idea where she came up with that but it's mental.

When I got my results back it shows that I am 100% European. Western and central. Every ancestor I discovered also came from Europe of course and many settled in the American colonies early on. Many on my mother's side came from England, Ireland and Scotland. If my dad was my biological father, his people came from Scandinavia. I don't really know if he was my biological father and the only way to test it is to get one of my nephews to take the DNA test. 

When I got the results back one of the first things I did was send my stupid sister a letter and tell her she is *not* Native American. Not by any means. I didn't send her a copy of the results because if she wants results she can pay for a test. Me and my siblings are all gingers. The typical red hair, light eyes, pale skin and freckles. My idiot sister dyes her hair jet black which looks ridiculous because she is 60 years old plus her eyebrows are light. She looks hideous. I still laugh about her claiming to be a tribal member. I had never even heard of the Algonquin people until I saw my sister's profile online. So crazy."

They both did Ancestry.com..fast forward to a couple of months and they both get their results the same day. My cousin that‚Äôs in her late 40‚Äôs her‚Äôs comes back as half Cuban &amp; European my other cousin in her early 50‚Äôs comes back as British, Irish and West European. The shit hit the fan when they confronted my Aunt. While my uncle(their dad growing up) was overseas in Vietnam my aunt had two separate affairs and had of both them by two different men.  Things have quieted down since then but when it first happened I felt like I was on an episode of Maury. "

"Back in my Arduino days, I had a roommate that could never wake up to his alarm. He got fired from two jobs because he just couldn‚Äôt wake up to get to them. In his desperation, he asked me for help. I suggested we use an Arduino hooked up to an electric squirt gun to wake him up. He said he was willing to give it a try. We found a squirt gun that had an electric trigger and so I wired the Arduino to it and set it to go off at a certain time. There was a little switch he had to flick also attached to the Arduino to turn it off. This squirt gun was pretty much a super soaker when it came to distance and quantity of water dispensed. So we mounted it to his wall across the room aiming right at his bed. He would set his phone‚Äôs alarm one minute before the Arduino‚Äôs alarm. After about a week of getting soaked every morning, his body learned that the sound of his phone‚Äôs alarm was a warning for getting soaked. So his body started actually waking him up to his phone and allowing him to turn off the Arduino in time. He uses the same exact alarm sound to this day and now has no problems waking up. It took about a week of trauma for him but in the end he was thankful. Haha. So maybe you can make something like this. You could even use nerf guns rather than water to make it less extreme."

A doctor at a local hospital told me that just from building a database on the bloodtypes of newborns and their parents it was evident that 5 to 10% had different fathers.
"It's similar to a Yankee Swap if you've heard of that game.

Each person brings in a gift, wrapped.  Then you draw numbers out of a hat.  The first person gets to pick a gift and unwrap it.  They hold onto that gift.  The second person gets to chose between stealing the gift person number one has, and opening a new gift that hasn't been opened yet.  Person three can steal from person one or two.  If your gift is stolen, you can steal from someone else, or open a new gift.  This goes on until everyone has a gift.  In our office, number one gets to steal any gift they want at the end, since they didn't get a chance to steal a gift during the game.  So the last person in line, and the first person both really get the best chance to find a gift they want.  

Also at our office after a gift has been stolen three times, it's off limits for stealing.  Most of our gifts are alcohol, so it's really just a lot of stealing from each other for the fun of it.  We also have a rivalry going, myself and a female co-worker always steal from each other just because it's tradition now to do that to each other. Last year I got a really nice looking bottle of beer that was branded after Game of Thrones.  I never opened it, I just wanted it because it looked awesome.  My supervisor had actually ended up with it, but he really wanted a bottle of red wine, so we swapped bottles privately after the game was over."

To cheer you up: had a friend who got blackout drunk. In this state he ran naked through the dorm to knock on some pretty girls door, whom he had never spoken to. Security guided him back to his place. He then proceeds to go to the shared kitchen, eat all the food which did not belong to him, and get hit hard with the runs. He managed to shit all over the kitchen, even in the dishwasher (who does that?) before he passed out. He woke up to a bunch of students gawking at the sight. People from other doorms took the trip to see the famed shitkid. A great TIFU if there ever was one.

"This is karma. You can‚Äôt be into Japanese girls because you like manga or anime. The girls are not like that, by and large. 

Learning Japanese is great, asking around about someone covertly is kind of creepy, my dude. 

Slipping because you were trying to impress someone is 100% your fault. Your ‚Äúex-friend‚Äù did nothing wrong. 

If you really like this person because of who she is (not where she‚Äôs from and a laundry list of self-attributed weebrotic characteristics), then speak to her in English and build a friendship. 

It can be tricky for Japanese to make native-speaker friends at times and those friends are very valuable for their study-abroad experience. If something develops thereafter, great. 

Some of my students have kept in touch with their foreign friends for decades. It‚Äôs something to think about. Don‚Äôt let a fetish ruin what could be a great opportunity to make a valuable friend. 

In addition, a few of my friends and students have had the bad boyfriend experience from guys who were clearly just after a stereotypical Japanese woman, the hottie du jour. I can‚Äôt stress this enough: manga and anime do not paint accurate pictures of women from these countries. They are women just like any other. If you jump into something thinking she will be super kawaii and wear pigtails every day and be low-key horny for you all the time, you‚Äôre going to have a bad time. "

"My first time coming home stoned (completely fuckin baked) in high school was a nice Sunday afternoon, my dad was proud of the grill full of steaks he had going and wanted me to see. I grinned, said ‚Äúlooks awesome‚Äù and patted him on the back, my mom had everything else ready on the counter inside. She talked while I tried keeping my composure telling myself to play it cool.

Mom and I got all our sides prepared, baked potatoes, corn on the cob, green bean casserole... the works... all the kind of shit you wanted as a teenager when the munchies still kicked in hard. I remember her asking what we did this afternoon, I think I told her we were fishing. (which wasn‚Äôt a lie)

My dad came in with his tray of steaks and told me to take my pick. I acted like I knew what I was looking for in a good steak but I just got the biggest of all and laid it over everything else on the plate of food. This is where it went south, I must have just stopped and stared at the mound of goodness I had just created for more than I thought, I came to when my  dad snapped his fingers in front of my face and asked if I was looking for something else... I said steak sauce out of instinct, he said ‚Äúoh, yeah, forgot to set that out‚Äù, opened the fridge and held it open for me. I took my plate to the table... walked to the fridge... grabbed the gallon of milk.... and poured it over my plate like I was making a bowl of fucking cereal.... 

I caught myself but it was way too late, I looked up to see my dad still holding the fridge door open with the most wtf look on his face. I heard my moms silverware hit her plate at the same time. I didn‚Äôt look at her.  I put the milk away, took my plate to the sink, cupped my food like I was draining pasta and got rid of the milk. Nobody said a damn word...  still haven‚Äôt to this day about it and it was 20 years ago. They knew though..."
