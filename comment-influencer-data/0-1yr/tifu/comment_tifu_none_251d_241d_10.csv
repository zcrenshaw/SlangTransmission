"This requires a lot of extra input on your post. Minors cannot be randomly drug-tested, or to self-incriminate themselves. That's part of the fourth and fifth amendments to the Constitution unreasonable search and seizure and self-incrimination.

So the question is why do you think they can do either. If it's because they say so then they're wrong. If it's a matter of you maintaining a space on a sports team or some other activity which you've already agreed to, there might be some grounds for testing, but again it all comes down to your 4th and 5th Amendment rights. And I'm assuming you live in the United States"

"Distasteful jokes are dad area, when I was kid long time ago when internet was new thing  (dialup!) I had my mates over we had few tabs of cars open so we could claim innocence and tabs of porn. We got a bit too loud discussing size of tits and my dad came over ""guys whatcha doing?"" ""Oh nothing just looking at cars"" ""yea well show it to me... Umm not that the other tabs... Cars you say?"" So his running dad joke for next 5 years was ""cars"" related like ""erase history after watching cars at night"" ""oh my son favourite hobby is watching car pictures on internet"" ""flush the tissues after you end your car watching session""...

Then...while gifting the item's gift box, grab the lookalike from it, and GULP.  An evil laugh should then be emitted, as you hand over the actual jewelry.

"Deodorant masks the smell and or has some antibiotic properties to kill the bacteria that produces the bad smell.

Antiperspirant contains a salt that complexes with the water in perspiration to make it unavailable to said bacteria.

""Natural"" products either contain the raw form of the salt or don't contain it all.  If it says ""Antiperspirant"" it has to contain the salt and list how much active ingredient there is.

The most effective kinds are roll-on, because they have better bioavailability.  The least effective are solid sticks, but they tend to be the mildest.  Even after showering you can skip a day as it takes a few days to wash out the salt.  So try one that's comfortable for you and just using deodorant in-between days.

"There you go again mentioning once again how you do things right and OP messed up. The sub is to laugh, and maybe point out things the OP did wrong. But when they themselves, in their original post, describe that they were wrong, have learned their lesson and will now correct their behavior. Its kind of useless to come in here and chime in with ""well you're a bad pet owner you should obviously do (thing OP clearly already outlined to do in the future)."" It makes you look ridiculous, and when you got called out you doubled down. There is also a difference between making fun of OP and their mistake and dickish behavior. You expressed the latter. There is difference between someone jokingly saying a joke such as ""Hey OP what are you gonna do next? Feed chocolate to your dog?"" Which is clearly a joke. And then theres your totally unnecesary comment that repeatedly lists OPs errors unnecessarily and tells them theyre a bad pet owner then tell them what to do. When they clearly know now what not to do without you or your non-humoristic babble that tou perceive as helpful. Have a great day dude. "

"I had parked at a designated long term parking (so not near terminal but 7 minute bus ride away) in Melbourne Australia, for 32 days and it ended up costing $AU300. I can‚Äôt imagine airport parking in a US ‚Äúflyover‚Äù state to cost more than double that!"
"Big city here, yeah, it you park in some shitty lot that's 3 miles away, and get bussed to the airport, it's about as low as like $5.99...but then there is multiple fees, and they do hourly rates up to $5.99 daily, so what you call a 4 day trip, they call a 5, and with fees, you owe $41....when you were thinking 6x4=24.

On property is a LOT worse.  I often fly out of a smaller airport with absolutely no cheap parking near the airport.  $14 a day it is.  My 5 day trips are billed as 6, and there goes $84."

Why? Would you want to pay more or would you want to start smoking just to quit? Neither seem like you‚Äôd get anything positive out of it?

"Exactly, stealing time is illegal and that's what this guys main job is apparently. Sounds like a lazy piece of shit to me. "
"Don't mean to rub salt in the wound, but it sounds like maybe you just learned a valuable life lesson. Don't EVER assume the price of something, especially when it's some kind of service. Always verify the cost, and read the fine print. This advice has saved my ass more times than I can count."

"Very well put. I agree with your reasoning completely. I'm 47 and self employed. I understand that no one would care about the quality of my jobs as much as I do. It's ultimately my responsibility to make sure my jobs come out perfect and are safe. It's electricity so there can't be any mistakes. I learned from my Dad who was meticulous too. There are so many things to learn in this business, and some of those things are complex, but the last 7-8 guys I've employed can't even grasp or remember the ridiculously easy stuff, like ""don't touch the sheetrock when you install switches. You'll leave fingerprints"", or ""Don't scratch the door frames when you bring a ladder in the house"". You have to tell them stuff like that every single time. Forget about teaching them how to make solid connections and how to wire 3way and 4way switches. They don't want to even know. They just ask me to do it. That's ridiculous and frustrating. These guys think they should earn $30 per hour too. They are very efficient at taking days off or looking for a raise though. My guys work about 40 hours a week, while I usually put in 80, and if a job is running a little late or I ask if they'd like to work on a Saturday for time and a half, the answer is usually no. Zero initiative. Either I'm on a 10 year stroke of really bad luck or the whole generation has changed drastically. "
"the good news is ""B"" played herself by calling the cops. Get a copy of that police report and make sure it includes everything.

A healthier action, in your case, would be to talk honestly about your depression with a professional. I get the impression you're not being honest enough with your therapist if you're experiencing suicidal ideation and you're not getting specific treatment for that. Either that or it may be time to see a therapist who takes your problems more seriously."

"My mum has lost her engagement ring in the move we made down from New England to Florida. The house here has been under serious renovation so most of our stuff was packed into one room. With arthritis, a couple surgeries, and other health problems causing weight fluctuation, she hadn't been wearing it. I guess a few boxes were moved in that room and her jewelry box fell? We've since unpacked EVERYTHING, looked in every box, and the ring is gone. 
As she says, yeah it's a ring, it's a material object, but it still hurts. We suspect one of the many builders or laborers we had in may have found it, but I don't see how. Either way, as of right now, it's gone. 
I also know the panic of realising your necklace is gone days later. Mine was kinda cheap but it was a symbol of my boyfriend's love, especially since we live so far apart, and my heart broke at that moment. I did find it again, but I know exactly how you feel. It's not so much the THING no matter how beautiful and expensive something may be, it was the love behind it. My heart goes out to you. "

If they are asking for help to pay for basic necessities in a shopping line, it's probably not the right time to offer a detailed financial plan.  Sometimes you just gotta give a hand.  But I get your point.  There are immediate needs, then ways to help long term needs.

Have a good one."

"I really hate that feature on iPhones. I literally called 911 by accident three days ago because of it. Was just fiddling with my phone in my hand and looked down and saw 911, so I panicked and hung up. They called me back twice and my paranoid brain was freaking out. Luckily the 911 operator just left a voicemail saying to call again if I needed the police or paramedics and to disregard the message if I didn‚Äôt. "
Man those cats sure got out just in time.

After I hung up with the school the lowest level HQ rep said she would catch me up later with any actions I had and to tell my daughter hi.

Like I said in the beginning of the post this happened a year ago. Since then things have gotten much better. It's something funny to look back on now and include the short version in meetings when I speak lmao. But yea at the moment is was one of the actual dumbest things I have ever done.

"The movies vary wildly in quality - for the original series and Next Generation, even-numbered movies are better than odd.

For the Chris Pine movies, I enjoyed the first one (Star Trek 2009) and the third one, Beyond, but thought Into Darkness sucked. I'd definitely recommend that you watch the 2009 movie - the opening 15 minutes alone is worth the price of rental, and since you've seen Enterprise, there's a cute reference to Archer that you'll catch. 

For the series, season 1 and even parts of season 2 of The Next Generation are pretty terrible; in general, the first 2 seasons of any post-original-series Star Trek are always weakest. I'd personally recommend skipping a bunch of early S1/S2 TNG, but other fans would tell you to watch it all. (Voyager probably has the strongest season 1, but never gets as good as TNG or DS9. DS9 is my personal favorite.)"

"You would think so.  At my current company, we have a biweekly meeting.  The higher ups congregate in a meeting room and everyone else dials in.

It is highly sensitive company info, but there is no authentication.  Anyone who misdials and gets that number by chance is also in on the meeting.

The higher ups can hear each other just fine.  They feel no pressure to talk into the mike.  When someone remote is speaking, I hear them fine, but when a higher up is talking it is just so much blah, blah, blah.

The meeting software does not allow the higher ups to control the mute.  So there is a fair amount of ""If you're not presenting, can you please mute."""
This happened to me too when I was about the same age but my mom and dad back then had a waterbed that had a over hang edge. I knew if I had crawled into bed with them they would have sent be back into my own bed and I liked laying under the over hang and crawled down there and fell asleep. I was awoken by panicked shuffling and lights all over the house being turned on and my mom on the phone talking to someone probably the police. I remember crawling out and did not understand all the excitement and their panic. 
"If anything, this scenario would be much worse as a full-fledged ""adult"". Point being, you'd have to stop living together and find a new place, buy new furniture, if there's a marriage and kids involved..well that's a whole different story!

I drove to his house and he lied.  I punched him in the face, left and was no longer friends with anyone who decided that it was better for my friends group if I didn‚Äôt find out.

It all worked out for the better."
Why did they start looking? Was it because your other friends thought they'd lost her?

"This is false. Some jurisdictions will look right away depending on the person and circumstances. We have silver alerts for instance for older people and it‚Äôs as quick as amber alerts. It‚Äôs best to always call right away if it‚Äôs obvious a person is missing in foul play, the police and detectives can sort out how fast they want to act. "
"That's not true.

"I don‚Äôt think you fucked up, there is nothing wrong with in trying to see the best in people. It will hurt and be shit for a while but eventually you will get over it, and look back at how it has made you stronger and more aware of people. 

I know because something similar happened to me once, nothing hurts more than betrayal. But best of luck for the rest of your life and remember, you‚Äôre only 17, you won‚Äôt care about this at all in the future, it only hurts because it is recent."
"You don't have to wait 24hours to report someone missing. Adults obviously have free will to just leave unlike kids, but if they're life is going good and they have a routine and then just randomly disappear it's still suspicious of something happening
"
‚ÄúYou cheated on me? When I specifically asked you not to?‚Äù
People that fall for this blackmail bs are seriously stupid. Who the fuck cares? And you look twelve in the screenshot

"As a fellow Gay, that's gay code for ""damn, I wish he was gay. I'll wait until he is drunk and feeling bi curious"""
"Kinda sucks, you are really cute! We'd love to have you batting for our team, anyday!"
"Maybe, maybe not, we'll never know for sure! 

Thank you!"
Small claims court?
"So much this. I know from personal experience that parents like this don‚Äôt stop. This is why when I got a job that make 42k a year, I told my mom I was making $9 an hour. "
I guarantee if you would of bought a pewdiepie chair this wouldn‚Äôt of happened 
"""These are real, by the way..."""
Hope OP read this
"This and change your addresses! I had to make sure all my addresses were changed and had to threaten my mom with reporting her to the feds for opening up my mail. 

I had been freaking out for two weeks thinking that they were doing more testing on a biopsy I had gotten and she was why I hadn‚Äôt heard anything. When I found the opened letters on her bedside table I threatened pressing charges. Bitch never told me I came back negative for cancer. I was then attacked for not being a good daughter for wanting to report her, but it‚Äôs a federal offense to open up mail that doesn‚Äôt belong to you."

"Okay, there is a difference between dipping into the kids college fund for their birthday and stealing their student loan to fund incompetence.

&gt;You wouldn't hold it against a two year old for spilling grape juice on the carpet, so why would I or the OP hold it against the parents?

At least OP will get to grab Jessica Biel's boobs.
Your honor.....we find the defendant....a moron!
No it doesn‚Äôt. They‚Äôre grown ups. They should know how to make what sacrifices / lifestyle changes need to be made to keep what they have. 
Congrats on coming out on not being gay. 
It's the Double Slit Experiment: They're gay depending on whether or not you observe them.
"To make this more hilarious, most people I know that went from a catholic school ended up being, like, SUPER gay."
You guys do lose very few players.
"Maybe just hijacked the top thread to get his point? That said a valid, thoughtful and funny point so I dont mind in the slightest. "
