Sending pic of the condoms was a bit over the top.
your life is a sitcom
"Jesus dude, you could‚Äôve just said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, we‚Äôve gotten so close and I realised I‚Äôm interested in you and felt a bit awkward when leaving because I wanted to make a move and kiss you but chickened our‚Äù like... who sends a picture of condoms"
"Six months from now, OP: ""12 Hour Sudafed for $1 a box? Time to stock up!"""
"Tell him the truth.  All of what you explained.  Be sure to bring the real document you meant to submit and as him - as an adult, not as a simpering kid - if he would accept that you f'd up and take your actual submission for the class.  It can't hurt and in fact may be refreshing for him to see a student take responsibility for their own mistake."
Its not incest if you say no chromo!
This is my favourite TIFU in a longass time.
My wife constantly tells me that I'm basically a Simpsons character.
"Who sends pictures of the condoms you were hoping to use to a girl you haven't even flirted with lmao congratulations, you're about to be know as ""that guy"" in your friend group"
I'd love to get an update on how the next family gathering is going and if he changed his behavior.
Each day we stray further from the Lord‚Äôs light
The real tragedy is you sent a dick pic with the OwO on it.
"So we got poop knife, and now cum fork..."
I'm imagining a 50 foot receipt rivaling CVS automatically printing and curling up eventually forcing itself into a brick oven and suddenly lighting half the kitchen on fire
"As a teacher and a woman, you just say ‚Äútoo bad we are going to the bathroom!‚Äù They won‚Äôt know the difference!"
The uncle still being interested after the big reveal is the best part here.
How could I pass on such a great deal.
"Finally, a proper FU that isn't about mild embarrassment from sex. That was an entertaining read, you have my respect and sympathy."
Totally not acceptable. Confession is supposed to be private. If she confessed it should be between the two of them. Right?
"Yeah thanks for the advice man. I won't lie, I'm a mess so this is actually nice to hear some good advice."
"*""God's Plan"" softly plays in the background...*"
"Instant pots are great!

$10 would have been a give away.."
That's soap and dead skin. Any max strength drain cleaner will open it back up. If one comes with a long tool with teeth get it. That will help with getting the hair out.
At least it‚Äôs nice of them to cancel the order whist at the same time dealing with the fire you started
You made the mistake of thinking that OP has any social sense at all.
I love that the elevator went from terror to laughter in seconds. And that OP didn't think everybody was a dick for assuming they were all going to die.
Don't feel bad at all. Her dumbass fault for having loud ass cheating sex in her own apartment.
"Probably improved the smell in there, so his sacrifice was likely appreciated by the next person.  Even if they happen to notice all the paper towels are gone and in the bin covered in suspect fluid"
"The same guy who sulks in pictures and apparently doesn't enjoy hanging out with his ""almost soulmate"" if sex isn't involved.

Yikes."
"Holy shit, it doesn't work like that my brother"
Shoulda puked. Could have had a two-for-one fetish night.
"Professor: ""So....    .... where can you get me more of this?"""

"Back to the ol' grind on Monday, eh?"
Was it worth losing your ball for a story this good?
"Yikes.

You could've told her the truth in a less creepy way. Like by not sending her pictures of condoms and bringing up your sexual frustration.

Perhaps mention you fancy her and you were frustrated in yourself for not making a move when you had the chance.

Live and learn I guess, better luck next time!"
It's a cat.  People need to chill the fuck out.
"Well, nice to know they will deal with these things."
And that‚Äôs when I would have gotten sick and ruined the moment.
This is a great story. Hilarious but also sprinkled with sadness. Trying times we do live in.
"The closeted part ain't weird... the ""are we still doing this?"" attitude is."
"It's not just that, everything from start to finish here was wrong. I'm going to assume OP is young, because these are all young man mistakes:

1 - The mindset. He says right off the bat that there was no legit flirting. Magically he assumes that because he gets an invitation to hang out indoors, it's on. That's a leap you just don't make if you know any better. Young man mistake.

2 - He chides himself for ""not making a move."" You make moves on someone you think is interested, and not only that, in this context, the making of said move seems to leave out any kind of leadup or framework. What was he gonna do? Close the YouTube window, grab a titty, and hope for the best? Young man mistake.

3 - When it was time to leave, OP gets one last chance to tell this girl what's actually going on, *and he fucking lies about it.* Talk about young man mistakes, that's a twofer! First, he's emotionally unavailable, and he's lying about it! To be fair, this is the least young man of his young man mistakes, because grown men do this shit all the god damn time. Still a mistake, though.

4 - This is the crowner. After blowing his chance to come clean at the door, rather than trying to play it off so he might have another chance later, he ruthlessly murders any future chance he might have had by confessing *through text after the fact.* Never mind the picture of the condoms, which is just idiotic icing on the cake. If you've got something important to confess to someone who actually means something to you, YOU DO THAT SHIT IN PERSON LIKE A HUMAN BEING WITH SOME SELF-RESPECT. Again, young man mistake.

In all honesty, OP has an entire thread of people shitting on him, but in all this shade is a metric shit-ton of actual wisdom, but the one thing I haven't seen anyone mention is the following question:

Did OP even really like this girl? Because ""we had fun together"" isn't the same thing. ""We got along well"" isn't the same thing. At the end of the post, his main lament is blowing his chance at getting laid, not the fact that he just murdered this friendship execution-style. I mean, the undercurrents of regretting that are there, and it probably factors at least a little into OP deciding to tell us this story, but it's pretty subtle, man. 

I hope he reads through this thread and takes some of the advice in here to heart, but not as much as I hope he actually learns from the experience. I was a young moron once, and believe it or not, I have absolutely done more cringey shit than this; I didn't have the internet to tell me where I fucked up, though."
"So let's get this straight ;

The company screwed the pooch and sent an offer letter with a higher dollar value than they realized, and fired YOU because you hit accept?

Did you leave a job to accept this new position?"
"Back in the 90s when the World Trade Center in NYC was first bombed (truck bomb in the garage for people that don‚Äôt remember) I was doing work for a company in one of the towers. It was only a few days after the bombing so to help lift everyone‚Äôs spirits I decided to bring a bunch of brownies in with me. I had them in an air tight metal tin in a large duffle bag full of paperwork. 

The express elevators in the towers were very fast and would make your ears pop from the rapid pressure change. Apparently it also makes air tight metal brownie tins pop. The tin opened with a loud metal bang and everyone in the elevator jumped. I don‚Äôt recall if anyone started crying but I know everyone was freaked out. After explaining it was just the brownie tin I ended up sharing them with the other people in the elevator to help calm everyone‚Äôs nerves."
"I mean this in the nicest way possible, but how can you be so stupid haha"

"Honestly, probably the worst way to approach the situation. I'm sure there was a few things he could've done to gauge her interest in him; Netflix, wine, tickle fights, dancing, Twister, making a home cooked meal together, blindfolded flirty shenanigans, etc. But to send her pictures of condoms made it seem like she was a slut and didn't perform her slutty duties and it made him upset. I can see why she's upset with him. That move completely undermined any actual, genuine connection they may have developed. GL, OP."
"Dad definitely isn't a catholic priest, otherwise there'd be no son."

"After 26 years on this planet, this year I discovered that it was in fact very weird doing on average 200-300 farts per day, and having countless nights of awful stomach pains after having milk or eggs. 

I did an intolerance test to discover i was very allergic to them both...

A few weeks after cutting them from my diet my  tiny little mind was blown into pieces when I realised I was averaging 3 farts a day.

"You made a very fundamental mistake.

you mistook friendship for a potential booty call.

I mean, you admit that there was zero sexual talk between the two of you.  So, I'm guessing she literally had no idea you were interested in her, then you did nothing to broach the subject and simply passively sat there and waited for 'magic' to happen that would let you get some booty.  And then you got upset when it didn't magically happen and then TOLD her that you both wanted sexy time and yet didn't do anything to make it happen.  Not a hint, not a suggestion, nothing.

Yeah, this is a fuck up.

You need to immediately apologize and accept that she's not into you like that.  And let her decide if she still feels comfortable enough to be your friend.  If not, then congrats, you lost a friend because you didn't put in any effort to let her know how you really felt.  

You really did fuck up."

"I don't masturbate in the shower, but when I clean my drain it could easily be mistaken for hair matted with semen.  In this case it's shampoo and conditioner.  Maybe you're right but you can't just assume it's the semen that has coagulated in your drain.  Drains are disgusting and foul smelling if not cleaned regularly (particularly if you have long hair or live with someone who does).  It's kind of funny that your drain cleaning is wrapped up with feelings of sexual revulsion tho."

"That's... Not true. Max strength drain cleaner is highly concentrated lye. It oxidizes the buildup much faster than air and water can, allowing it to be easily swept away.

You can also use bleach, or peroxide, if you have a lot of it just sitting around. The important point is that it must be an oxidizing agent."

"Reminds me of a time in October or November 2001.  I'm at a combination barber shop and beauty salon in my college town on a football Saturday. This was just like the shops you see in the movie Barbershop, very Lively and talkative. At various points people were making comments about the size of the crowd of the football stadium so soon after 9/11. All of a sudden a very large jet engine seemed to fly right over the shop, probably a flyover for the game, but the shop went so eerily quiet for a whole 30 seconds before people decided to laugh after realizing it was nothing."

Those get issued REAL FAST in situations like domestic terror."

"In college somehow my apartment came upon a XXXL ultra-ribbed condom and as a joke we'd hide it in each other's stuff (like inside the pillow cover, in a box of cereal, etc) and try to outdo each other. Once I hid it inside my roommate's calculator cover--and I'm pretty sure I won the competition for the rest of the year.

It just so happens his professor forgot to bring his calculator to class that day, so who does he ask except my studious roommate who always sat in the front row. The professor opens the calculator lid and wham, in front of 100+ students a huge golden-wrappered condom falls on the floor. The professor picked it up, looked at it, and said ""well I can see you really enjoy math, but I've never heard of anyone using calculus as foreplay"". Fun times."

She sounds insecure in her looks and possibly a bit naive. Maybe she even WANTED you to be attracted to her and was hinting at it by admitting she felt ugly (not something you can be sure about, but a possibility). Sending her a picture of condoms and lamenting not getting all up in that is like full acceleration headbutting someone that wants a peck on the lips. You shouldn't just bulldoze into someone like this."

"Lmao, screw the rules. This is funny"
i think its a quote from 1930s? like many things in the movie its just flat out wrong for the sake of the plot. bees are not airplanes so offcourse laws of aviation dont apply.
"My brother pretty much did the same thing when he went to visit a girl (across the country) he was talking with.  They spent time with a group of friends, went to the beach, boating, etc.  He said she didnt seem too interested in spending time alone with him, that she hadn't texted him in the 2 days since he got back, and he couldnt figure out why.  I told him that was a bummer.

Jump forward a week and I am talking with my mother on the phone about it.  He failed to mention that her grandfather had died 2 weeks prior to their visit and her father was in the hospital.  He couldnt figure out why she didnt want to have sex with him as her family was dying.

They are doing a competition together next month and will see each other then, and he doesnt want it to be awkward.  So he wants to text her to tell her how he feels and that he doesnt want it to be awkward.  I told him that he shouldnt do anything like that.  He should have offered his condolences and told her he is there if she needs anything.  Then a week before the event, Express that he is excited to compete and that he has been training, etc.

Some people definitely forget that people are humans and dont want to be put on a pedestal, or on the flip side objectified.  They dont think about what they are saying, and that their words have meaning."
His problem was he was waiting for something romantic or cute to just happen that would've gradually developed into sexytime. Movies give off completely unrealistic expectations of funny/cute/romantic things just happening. They don't. At least not usually. Most of the time it's up to the the person that is interested to make a move. The smoother he/she is the less pervy it appears and more charming it comes off as. OP was probably just severely out of practice and let his raging boner get the best of him.

"NTA.

I dated a Mormon in highschool and it was the most stressful thing in my life. I was unaware of how extreme that church was and I knew she was devout but we did stuff anyways.

Once I caught on, I tried to respect her religious boundaries but it was already too late. She kept pushing the envelope further and further. Guilting me into having sex then crying afterwards.

One day, she couldn't take the guilt any longer and she went and confessed to her bishop. I was actually going to her church at the time because I knew this day would come and I couldn't let her confess without me or else the story would be twisted.

Well, the bishop made her confess anyways then called me into his office. He told me that according to her, I was the one that pushed the boundaries and forced her into sex.

So I broke up with her, never went to that church again, graduated and left."

At first I thought it was absolutely hilarious until I met one of the guys a few years later at a bar. He came up to me (mostly sober haha) and gave me the most heartfelt speech about how he wished he could've shown his true self to the world, how much time he wasted trying to craft an image that didn't exist, ect.

This poor girl NEVER brought anything sexual up with you, never flirted, yet for god knows what reason you decided you should try and fuck someone who has given you zero reason to believe they would want to fuck. I feel so bad for her. She probably just genuinely wanted to hang out with someone who she thought was a friend and she ends up feeling used. You are not her friend if you would just assume she would want to have sex with you, and you‚Äôre definitely not her friend if you make her feel very awkward by confronting her with the fact that you wanted to fuck her."

"Reminds me of the time when I was in middle school and the school printer had an app (it was a Lexmark app and no one knew it existed since you‚Äôre supposed to use the computers to print). It was a really bad looking app and you were supposed to use an image to print. Since me and my friend didn‚Äôt have computers at the time we ended up trying that out. We go to the library and notice that the printer won‚Äôt stop printing and it‚Äôs printing quite rapidly too (to the point where it would almost shoot out paper). It doesn‚Äôt print the image but it‚Äôs instead a 2 line combination of random numbers, letters, and those Microsoft word emoticons. We realize that the app is broken and it doesn‚Äôt work. Whatever. Later on we get the idea that we can remotely ‚Äòhack‚Äô the printer to distract people. So we do a test in front of the librarian and try it. She panicked and cancels the process via a button. It had already printed like 40 pages (it‚Äôs loud as hell too). During one of those parent teacher interview nights my friend takes a paper, places it in the bottom tray, and curves it so that it acts as a ramp for the rest of the ammunition. I load in some random picture of the GTA V logo and then press print. The printer is rapidly shooting paper everywhere making a mess and a firework show. It was beautiful. Looking back it was pretty rude, we shouldn‚Äôt have done that."

Jumping up and down pantsless on the corner of a desk for 15 minutes.... yikes
I'm not sure that would make me feel better.

"at some point mate you just gotta go ""me undies are fucked lads one minute."" and sort it. :D"
Possibly I'm just a team member but we've dealt with this kind of issue in the past. Comes down to a bad system
"Please just message her ""I just realized I rubbed your dildo on my head X years ago!"""
Someone with an amazing and twisted amount of vision and foresight.
Plot twist: The Professor commissioned that work.
"All the online ordering modules with all of the POS software my company integrates with have a character limit. And also the printer would run out of thermal paper long before it even got hot enough to melt/burn.  

I'm curious to know what software/equipment they use because it really doesnt seem possible that this could happen."
Varying levels of amusement and disgust are currently swirling in my mind. I'm laughing... But I also have that confused sort of smile whilst doing so.
He‚Äôs a dragon. You notice a wolf fursuit on his desk.
Everyone laughs and THEN the elevator goes boom
"My old manager was in the Birmingham bombings in the 1970s, not injured but very badly affected with nerves.One time he was in the street and a bus backfired and he immediately hit the floor with his hands over his head.When he finally looked up, people were staring at him wondering what he was doing."
TIL there is a such thing as buying too many Instant Pots.
"Woah, My first precious metal! Thanks stranger."
"I asked a question there once and apologized vehemently *in advance* if I said anything offensive, as it was unintentional and I just didn‚Äôt know any better.

Roughly 80% of responses ignored my question completely and berated me for not using the proper vernacular at times in my post... despite me saying this may happen because I don‚Äôt know any better...

I am an extremely tolerant person who just wanted to know more about trans people for the sake of not accidentally offending anyone, and now I‚Äôm so afraid of offending trans people that I‚Äôm pretty likely to just not say anything in their presence ever again."
"This isn't a today I fucked up by confessing I wanted to fuck my friend. This is a today I fucked up by being that really gross creepy dude girls all warn each other about. It's one thing to say you had feelings, that cool. It's fine to have feelings and express them. I'm a guy and even I know you're basically a piece of shit for thinking of a girl like a piece of ass like that and then sending her a condom? Like what the fuck? You're not having sex for a long time with this kind of casual attitude. Pro tips girls don't like to be told how unhappy you didn't sleep with them you are. Comes off desperate and immediately is a red flag to stay away. Good job becoming the creepy guy who girls avoid like the plague. Or maybe a life lesson on how to treat women."
"I'm not sure, at least the chance to develop testicular cancer dropoed by 100% in the right one"
He just wanted to know how it tastes like! There's nothing gay about it!
I can tell you that it was at least as awkward to tell your parents and the doctor that you had a ball clapping contest
"Honestly as I said before, this is an incel origin story if nothing else"
How about I do anyway
I can't believe no one drove you home after knowing what happened. They should have insisted you go home and that they drive you.
That sounds pretty hilarious to me. Is your boyfriend a bit self conscious about his weight or something?

also watch out for coconuts
"well, go in monday, maybe lose a job. Don't go in monday, probably definitely lose a job."
My wife finds it rather enjoyable since I'm hung like toddler.
It's the other way around
If two state police showed up at my front door I would be stupid fucking nervous.
yea this is so dumb. they would have just unplugged it if the thing was printing so furiously that it would catch. and restaurants are usually pretty prepared to deal with fires from cooking. I couldn't imaging a register catching fire and no one being able to put it out.
VulvaSore I choose you!
"As a fellow Muslim dude myself, I think it's the thought that you know its prayer time and should get up and pray, but most times you're just too sleepy, especially the morning prayer which is the hardest one to get down"
Great move not telling her who your favourite stripper was though.
"Glad to hear you're okay but PLEASE don't flush tampons! Even if they are rotten, demon-filled tampons."
"Preacher's kids are always the worst.
Both my wife and I are also preacher's kids, so of course we made our families proud by meeting at a bar while we both were totally smashed, living in sin with each other for 7 years before tying the knot, and by being enthusiastic proponents of recreational drugs and day drinking.
We're the worst. Good thing they're religious so they have to still love us."
I read that as NASA which could be equally funny.
Also this is like... the best gender reveal ever. Way better than baby ones.
Writing TIFU post should tighten your alibi even more. Good call.
"You didn't FU, you raised a great daughter."
What kind of poor sheltered bastard doesnt know what a blowjob is at 16.
"Once in middle school I did literally run into another person. I had just started there, and desperately needed to pee. As I rush into the hallway entrance of the bathroom, a guy almost twice my size was exiting and I ran into him. 

He gently but firmly lifted me up around the arms and carried me back out WITHOUT BREAKING STRIDE. Without even looking at me or anything the whole time, he puts me down and says ""wrong way dude"" as he walked away.

At the time I was terrified, but looking back that was the funniest shit ever."

Username relevant!
"Not 2 condoms cringe though, this shit sounds like a incel origin story"
"Automatically did this in my head when I read ""Back in the 90s"".

I've watched this show too many times."
"I thought it was cute, and my bff who happens to be trans loved your photos. Fuck those assholes."
I was expecting this story to be even worse. I thought you were going to say you accidentally cast the whole video to the tv in someone else's room.
I do not envy that guy.
"Follow up question: Do you have to pee more often, because you only have one ball to store pee in?"
"You know, thats a question that is probably going to haunt me until i die. I literally have no idea. We don't communicate daily. It was out of the blue."
"I'm not going to have children, nor will my adopted feral cats (4) have kittens, so it was my only chance at a fancy cake :("
Hah. Well this is still better than that guy who ended up showing porn of himself and his gf to gf's dad.
And an identifiable phone number
How dare you assume that animal‚Äôs species.
"Similarly, but not quite as unique, I went years wondering why I was getting frequent stomach aches that just seemed to get worse as I got older. Turns out I‚Äôm slowly becoming intolerant to dairy, but I didn‚Äôt figure that out until I drank a giant glass of milk and my boyfriend suggested that my subsequent stomach pain was due to lactose sensitivity. Felt kinda dumb after that (but my stomach doesn‚Äôt hurt anymore)"
"As a dude with chronic nosebleeds, I sympathize. They're annoying as hell. There's always a little terror in my heart my nose is runny."
"Is that the Nissan dealership that offers free sodas, donuts, WiFi, and masturbation stations?"
"If it makes you feel any better, a table won't protect you from being crushed by a falling aeroplane."
"That‚Äôs just creepy dude. What were you thinking sending her a picture of condoms you were hoping to use on her. That‚Äôs just weird as fuck. Like what did you think would happen after doing some creepy shit like that, that she would magically want to sleep with you?"
Amazingly good story :D
"You didn't FU.
 
You can't chose where you come from, only where you go."
"You would think that after the third or fourth time, you‚Äôd realize it was the mailman and stop shaking your junk!"
"Whatever you say, Hitler."
"Wait a minute... the order is soap, shampoo, wank? 

&amp;#x200B;

I've got a feeling one of us is doing this in the wrong order."
"Congrats on your new pet. Your only mistake was having blue balls in the cake because your cat no longer has any balls! Or was that the point? Seriously though, people need to get a life. Having a gender reveal for your cat was way more cool than having one for a baby shower."
I don't think it will matter what direction he's going.
That doctor sounds like he has the type of bedside manner every doctor wants and should have.
"""We're friends, but I view you as a sexual object.  I'm so confused!"""

"Dude I‚Äôm sorry, but this is beyond creepy.  If this is true, then you legitimately stalked a girl obviously trying to get away from people like this, and even went as far as to fraudulently pose as some place she trusted in order to trick her into letting you into her private life?  I mean, you‚Äôre trying to circumvent everything she‚Äôs trying to do to protect herself.

I mean, I *really* hope you see how wrong this is, and don‚Äôt perform this type of action in the future.  This isn‚Äôt normal behavior.

I don‚Äôt mean to go into roast mode here, but this isn‚Äôt good.  The social media job part is kind of funny, but all the creepy actions surrounding it can‚Äôt be ignored.  Thinking any of this is ok will get you in trouble in the future, and nobody wants that."
Because anal is painful/awesome?
I think they just automatically enroll you in the liver transplant list?
It doesn‚Äôt exist. I clicked in hoping it did because I‚Äôm deranged.
"Thats right folks. Although cash registers all over the world manage to print receipts around the clock without ever catching fire, it was the script to the Bee Movie (lmao) that made one *catch on fire* and burn a restaurant down. Black smoke and everything. Its not like it would just run out of ink or anything, it literally burned the restaurant down.

By this logic CVS stores would never survive."
"Also, possibly from her POV, it makes OP seem like he was only friends with her because he wanted to have sex with her, not because he actually liked her as a person."
"Yes, but then it wouldn't pick up 20K upvotes on Reddit *taps on head* 

""TIFU by jizzing on my supermodel wife's shirt and the bank owner noticed and gave us a wink-I nearly DIED I'm still shaking"""
I'd like to be your friends friend. Replying from a friend.
Just not reverse cowgirl because you never turn your back on family.
"&gt;"" I‚Äôm so thankful that she didn‚Äôt come at me like a spider monkey. ""

LOST IT with that comment! LOL!!"
"I'll admit I've had this happen... Twice. This was when I was quite a bit younger and used to push them in way way too far and wonky. I won't go into detail about my experiences because (as you probably know), it's embarassing lol.
But I know the disgust you feel 100%. You'll get through the horror though ahah."
I mean it's gay incest no gene pools would be harmed.
"The FU wasn't confessing to a friend you wanted to fuck her, the FU was the way you did it.

^(I should use a throwaway to post the story though.)

Just let go. If she actually thinks fondly of you, she'll come back. If she doesn't, you know what not to do the next time this happens with a new person."

"Onion Pie?

Excuse me, I need to go Google a recipe to prank my sister with. 

She LOVES the French Meat Pie I make.  I'll just tell her I'm making a new version!"
"Just to clarify, YOU did not f up here - your mom did. I'm sorry she's reacting that way, but try to remember the Serenity Prayer during times like these. You can't control her. You need to focus on taking care of yourself. I'm just a little more than 4 years sober from alcohol myself, and believe me when I say that nothing is worth losing your sobriety over. Keep doing what you're doing, and don't let anyone or anything have that much power over you!"
Threads like this is why I like reddit and want all the political shit off so we can meme harder without offending anyone
Put some chilli between those layers so SOMEBODY knows if you have a breakage...
How about some good old vinegar?
"""Oh no, I feel bad because I didn't get to sleep with my best friend and now she wants to know what's going on, should I:

A. kindly tell her that I like her more than just as a friend and am beating myself up for not taking a good opportunity to make a move;

B. send her a picture of the goddamn condoms I had picked out for the occasion and complain about how sexually frustrated I am after such a long dry spell""

I'm both appalled and impressed OP just went with B and snapped her a sweet pic of those rubbers he was planning to use on her. A+ decision making right there."
"I love how the school thinks that some kids might potentially be suicidal, and their plan isn‚Äôt to try to address the reasons for these thoughts nor perhaps to try and figure out what can be done to try and make people feel safer there.. their first thought is to make people chant about how much they love themselves lol. Depression be gone!!"

"This made me laugh out loud.


Thankfully, he didn‚Äôt, and we are blessed with this top-notch TIFU."
Monistat chaffing relief powder gel! It isn't sticky and doesn't dry the skin like some diaper rash creams/ointments tend to do. And your underwear/clothes won't stick to your bits because it dries as a silky powder finish. The tube is small; but a little goes a long way.
This story is complete bollocks.
"What's even crazier is that if he were born 300 ago, that adventure would probably kill him."
He wears a hard hat and sunglasses and waves at you from a van? That fucking pervert is mimicking me to get to you. I‚Äôll try taking lunch early to catch him parking.
"Oh wow, I didn't think of that. I'll have to tell him."
Expected story to involve farting. I'm pleasantly surprised.
"I dont use the word ""cringe"" often but...cringe..."
... I'm not sure that's a good idea
That... happens to me too... My vision is supposed to be near perfect... Well f me right?
"Ayy, it's a tifu that's not someone having weird sex, but everything turned out ok and they're married."
"No. In 2006 a federal act was passed on the Sudafed containing pseudoephridne along with other products including broncaid were moved behind the counter you have to show an ID and sign a log. It's all tracked and if you buy over the monthly limit the feds will track you down like some poor guy who was stocking up for his son who had allergies when he was going on a month summer camp trip.

The stuff not behind the counter is Sudafed PE and contains phenylephrine which has been shown to be no better then placebo in multiple studies. So if you need actual relief you need to talk to the pharmacy.

Meth heads will offer you decent money to make a straw purchase so they can turn it into meth. It gets annoying getting hassled by gross people when I walk into a store after dark."
TIKM doesn't sound as catchy as TIFU
Whowos is bigger*
