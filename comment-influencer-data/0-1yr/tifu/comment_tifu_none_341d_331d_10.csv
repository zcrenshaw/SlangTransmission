I feel really bad for the teacher.
"Totally thought you were going to talk about using the nozzle on your genitals. That would be painful. Especially since it was a big one, not one of the little ones that attach to the end of the hose."
I feel like $200 for a hug job is way over priced.
"One word... Joselyn.
​

"
Seriously. OP didn’t fuck the teacher’s life - Joselyn and her parents did. No reason to go calling up the school making wild accusations that the teacher did it on purpose.

What is wrong with you? I read all this and you didn't even bother to post a picture of your cat. 
"You must have the calmest dad ever, imagine coming home to blood everywhere, people missing, phones left behind."
I bet you he used to leave it open for a nerdy kid to chill in his class.
"Your dad checked to see if you fucked up the machine, little did he know you literally fucked that machine"
Really seems like an overreaction by the school for leaving the door unlocked.
Oh sweet lord no
And what a shitty school. Who fires someone over an unclosed door? I can only guess this was the last straw for the teacher. Or politics maybe.
...bake at 350 for 45 minutes...
"I'm a high school teacher. It is really drilled into us to not leave the classroom door unlocked because we are 100% responsible for what students do in there. It really sucks that the school district decided to prosecute this fully, I know I've accidently left mine unlocked a few times. But you were just being a human being, you had no control over the investigation.  "

&gt; OH MY GOD

I gotta hand it to you. Even with this, I still didn't figure out the problem until I read it openly stated in your TL;DR at the very end. I am probably better off not getting pets ever...

A shame about the breeders, I'm glad they stopped."

"Maybe if you'd fucked Joselyn in that room, too, this wouldn't have happened."
"I work in IT. I've also lost a daughter. I've lost pictures, even though they weren't the only ones, and it was quite frankly devastating. This isn't a TIFU, this is a Today I Did The Right Thing and fuck your boss.

Ohhhh!!!!! Is that why they put handguns in ziplock bags inside the toilet? Just for cases like this? Those janitors deserve a raise!
"I know the struggle, I've been in my car with a co-worker I have a crush on. We were out getting starbucks for about 10 people and she has all the drinks in her lap and I'm starting up my car and I look over at her to make sure everything is all situated. It all looks good and as I'm putting my car into reverse she says, ""okay now don't whip it or I'll get wet,"" and I had to do my best to not say anything too dumb as I turned red. Sometimes I wonder if I'm getting fucked with. "
r/powerwashingporn ? J/k... But....
"That's the dumbest model of responsibilty ever. If I walked into the classroom with a laptop, hacked into the Pentagon, obtained the missile codes and nuked France, then the teacher would be at fault!!"
"I've seen her many times since.  We don't speak of it, and I don't think she told my Mom.  

It would be kind of awkward to say, ""hey, btw your son jizzed all over me the other day!"""

I bet you he left it open because opening and closing every door you go in during the day is annoying af. I know. I’m a teacher.

"I think it needs to be said that those fresh breath additives usually contain citric acid, which is toxic to cats. She could have gotten very ill from drinking it, but she's a smart kitty and raised a rumpus instead to let you know there was a problem.

"I didn't listen to my cat last week when she was complaining about her litter box being too dirty.

They all slammed themselves into chairlift poles?
I would take 10 of those guys in lieu of the giant cockroach that scrambled up my leg from under my desk last night.
"I agree. It seems odd. Like there's more to the story than even OP knows.

As a divorced teacher.

1. As OP said, the marriage was already weak.  If this kind of thing ruined it, then it was likely not long for this world.  A quality marriage should overcome a common mistake.

2. The school appears to have let him go for just this door? That seems iffy. How many kids were doing this? Was he actually wink wink encouraging? It's hard to know what admins knew.  

3. At the end of the day, OP doesn't know that the teacher is sad. Divorce happens. Getting fired happens.  Plenty of teachers leave teaching by choice.  The man could be much happier baking and single.  Many people find ways to be happy after far worse things happen to them.  

OP was a child.  He had no power over it and didn't try to destroy the guys life.

Shit happens."
"We’ve got a lot of optimists here, but just be aware there’s a chance she did not like the situation one bit and really just wants to get through this internship without any (more) weirdness.

I recommend rubbing one out before work, so that you can be in a more sane mindset during the day; when you’re horned up you might seriously misinterpret a situation and get yourself into actual trouble.

That and do exactly what the other redditor said: let her make the next move. If she’s interested you’ll find out (if you don’t misinterpret an actual normal conversation). If she gives you no signs at all, do not pursue.

Edit: didn’t know she was married. OP needs to find a different crush."
Thanks for the nostalgia giggle

"Wolf spider?

Hard to tell because of the angle, and not being perched on the wall.

They are bros. relocate him to the basement to kill the actual bad bugs.

When my parents got back together and bought the house they lived in, I had to room with my older brother (who lived with my dad prior) and the bedroom we had was too small for my computer. It was an old amish house, and in the basement there was a small side room used for can storage. I seized that room, ran extension cords into it, since it had no outlets, and put my desk in there. I also had a small server rack fit in there as well.

It was home to a BUNCH of wolf spiders. The room was like 5x8' but they were chill. Like 4 of them sitting on the walls, a couple inches from rear leg to front legs, etc. They hardly moved. They watched me do my thing, and I watched them do their.  I slowly considered them pets. The one that stared at me when I entered I called bill for some reason.

Never bothered me, they staked a claim to a spot on the walls and every time I entered would be facing slightly different directions but never crawled on me or my desk, just on the walls.

Spider Bros. I also had no insect problems."
"&gt; I investigated my car door handle to make sure someone didn't smear feces on it.

I think you did the right thing. Saving the friendship is great and all but being stuck in a friendship with someone you have feelings for isn't good for you in end. I feel like it's always best to get it out there. It relieves stress and tension and if you are rejected you can stop wondering and move on.

This for real. Steal his clients and fuck him over. Thats completely absurd. 
Try drinking wine with Ambien and you will probably ask his mom out too.
I had something like this happen. But instead of a knife it was our dogs tail tip getting cut off by a slammed door. The dog ran around the entire house painting the walls with it's blood before we could catch it. At this point my mom freaking out throws us 3 kids and the dog into the minivan doesn't even close the front door of the house and heads for the vet. This was back in the early 90s before we had cell phones. So Dad arrived home to an open door house (in the city) with blood all over the walls and no way to contact mom. Though we get home to him cool as a cucumber  sitting in his favorite chair watching TV.
How did you like the wine?
Yep. Lace wings are little stinkers.

"The question no one seems to be asking is how did the guys in the house know where his car was? Did the ""ladies"" come back yelling ""It's just a prank bro!""? Too many questions here... Also if he was in tight spandex where were his keys to said car? Does OP just leave his car unlocked in an apparent unsafe neighborhood? With the keys left in the ignition!?

Also how did they get the box up to the door with him in it? If he walked up to the door and got into an empty box wouldn't the ""drug dealers"" have a lookout that would notice, in the very least, a very bright red outfitted man rummaging around their front door? 

AND... the lady that answered the door said she didn't want help getting the package in the door? The box would have had to be wood! A cardboard box wouldn't be able to hold up to the weight of a human being lifted inside it. How was he breathing in the box? Were there air holes? Presumably he would have had to been in it a long time. How did such a large box fit through the front door? Who carried it inside? What kind of box was it? long and thin? or big and bulgy? Again a human male fit enough to do stripping would tear right through cardboard so it would have had to be a wooden box, who would have a wooden box on hand? Normally wooden shipping crates are built to order to prevent having excess space because every little centimeter and every single ounce is measured to charge someone for shipping. 

Furthermore who yelled the code word? From the story there is no one else there? Was it his postal dressed buddy? But OP says the lady didn't want help inside, so it couldn't have been him.

No cops are mentioned either, even if OP wouldn't want to talk they would have came, why leave that out of the story seems like a pretty interesting part..."

Tune in next weekend for your next instalment of  “I didn’t know I wasn’t suppose to masterbate with this thing. “
"It’s accountability.

Someone had to be “at fault” and that would fall on the responsible adults - in this case the school.

So either they take the blame for underage sex on the premises or they force it on the teacher who didn’t lock the door, and no one wants to take the blame and end up accuse of not looking after the students.

It’s wrong entirely - teenagers will do stuff like that and it is not the teachers fault it’s their own and if someone needed punished then detention/suspension on the students would have been the sensible response (to enforce no sex on school grounds in a lesser version of what the teachers would face for the same actions).

"Ah crap. This is exactly what happened to me. I let my studio unlocked so my students can come in any time they want to work on their project/school work and have a safe environment.

Other students found out about it, one day I went back to the studio to find out a student couple doing what hormonal teen does.

Now I have to lock it or be there to supervise.

It was a hassle that I had to walk from one end to another across the school just to let my student work at their free time. This goes on like at least 5-8 times a day.

I guess it worked for me, because of this, im no longer required to be in the staff office and was allowed to have my very own office in the studio.

Still, I could have been in deep shit if this turned out in a bad way."

"I stepped on one on the stairs. And the same night I saw one of those giant house spiders (that's literally how they are called) in my bathroom. 
I was completely traumatized for months. I was always seeing spiders in the corner of my eye, I couldn't sleep with my lights off without searching for spiders first, and once I threw my fork out of my plate because I thought that it was a spider. My brain confused a fork with a spider, yes. And one time I was sleeping at a friend's house and she accidentally touched my arm in her sleep and I jumped out of bed almost screaming because I was sure it was a spider what touched me. "

"My wife's SSD wouldn't be detect by her computer one day. So when I got home from work, I did everything I could think of to figure out the issue to no success. Even brought it to the IT guys at my hospital and their mirroring setup wouldn't detect the drive. So I sent it to a data recovery place a few hours away from us and they tech called me and said that they were able to get the drive to function and that I needed to sign in to my account and profile to continute with the next step with authorization and payment. Thinking it would be a few hundred bucks, which we were ok with paying, I signed into the account portal they set up for me.

 They wanted /***$19,899***/ to perform the recovery!! I about had a heart attack when I saw that big, bold number. The look of pure distress on my face had my wife concerned and sheepishly asked 'what's the damage?' I could only turn the phone screen to show her, for I could not find words.

Called the tech back and said there was no way we were going to pay that, got the sales pitch of ""SSDs are a premium product and difficult to recover from when failed"" and ""price reflects the amount of work necessary."" We ended up having to pay $200 just for them to ship it back to us, so I could take it out to my grandparents farm and put a few rounds of ammunition through it.

Edit: I also wanted to ask have you tried different brands and kinds of wet food? My one cat will only eat the pate version of wet food. Chunks of food in gravy are a no go for him. 

I don’t want to sound like I’m attacking you for how you’re taking care of your cat.

"I always sound really nutty when I explain the story of how I figured out my old cat Chester was trying to tell me one of our other cats threw up in the water bowl.

He kept yelling at me and waiting for me to follow him. First he plopped himself down in the bathroom and rolled around. Then he got up and plopped himself in the laundry room and rolled around. Finally he went to the room that had the water bowl and rolled around. He then went back to the bathroom and started again. He did this loop about three times with me following him.

Eventually I pieced it together - both the bathroom and laundry room were places he also associated with water. As a Maine coon he liked to sit in the tub and let water drip on his head. And we sometimes put the water and food in the laundry room when we had to corral the cats. 

So I decided to go off my nutty theory and checked his water bowl. Sure enough it was contaminated with puke. I changed the water and he immediately stopped his loop. 

I guess in a weird way it was him saying “yo I can’t drink the water in there and I can’t find water in the other Water Places so please add water to one of the Water Places I’m thirsty.” 

I wouldn’t worry about not being able to pick up on this making you a bad pet owner though. Part of owning a pet is that you naturally learn your pet’s weird communication cues. "

"It wasn’t a wolf spider, but cleaning my windowsill I found a tiny little spider homie chilling in the corner. He didn’t look like he could do any real damage to me so I left him alone.

By the end of the summer I had forgotten he was there and went back to clean that spot of the windowsill, there was a small web in the corner absolutely littered with the corpses of ants. Turns out they had tried to get in through a small section of window screen where it had a small tear, and this spider built his web right below the tear to catch food and trap ants all day everyday for a summer. 

I never knew where the spider homie went but it was a true bro that year, and since then I’ve always tried to save and relocate those fuzzy friendlies when I can."

"How did he react? That's the important part here, especially if the mom said you should start with friendship, because that seems to imply that she's okay with it progressing from there as long as you treat him right.

At first glance, I feel your embarrassment, but it's not all that bad on reflection. You just got a little cuddly and complimented his dimples, and while there's a chance it made him uncomfortable, there's also a chance that he didn't mind (or even liked it!)

I'd say your best bet for de-awkwarding the situation is something like, ""I drank more than I should have last night and lost some inhibition, and I'm sorry for getting so close without asking."" If he was uncomfortable, reassure him that you'll back off (*and follow up by actually backing off*), but if he didn't mind, it's a great opportunity to suggest that you hang out one on one and maybe work up to a date.

ETA: the wording I used does seem reductive of his possible discomfort. To clarify, getting that close without permission is definitely a fuckup, but *depending on his response* it might or might not turn out okay. OP should clarify whether it was okay with him, still apologize for cuddling without asking, and follow his lead on how to deal with the situation."
Thats why you had you teaching credentials revoked
"if i see blood coming back home and no one that should be there is there, 911 is getting called in a heartbeat"
It's a lot easier to understand if you're in the situation than if if you're just hearing it second hand. 
"Sure, why not...  Can we record it and sell it as a tool safety vid?  I feel like there's profit to be made here."
"Trust me, countless people have given me alternative methods to do this since it happened. Even the nurses at the hospital after my operation were telling me alternate ways. "
"Not your fault at all. Everyone needs ""me"" time, and it sounds like they drove you to it."
Tried this at my old job. Doesn't work :(
"You might never realize it, but while this was an accident, it was not a mistake."
"She would take off the sweater right in front of him and her luxurious milf tits would try escaping her bra and then she'd tell they dry cleaner she has a big thick cum stain on her sweater and her husband cannot find out about it since it's from her 19 year old family friend.

And then the porn music starts. "
Don’t worry I’m dumb enough to say it
"I feel like he has the address, his own eyewitness account, and his buddy's corroborating account, and all the injuries... do you think people can't be convicted unless they commit the crime right in front of the jury?"
You frenchfry’d when you should have pizza’d
"Bro, start your own data recovery with more honest business practices and used targeted advertising to make sure you steal all of his potential business! "
"This doesn't really follow though. Unless there were some other reason why locking the door was a big deal, the teacher isn't responsible for the sex, just leaving the door unlocked. 

This is pretty much how the world works. If I accidentally leave the keys in my car, I am not liable when someone steals it and runs someone over."
Sort of feel like the tone of this thread would be different with genders swapped...
This ended a lot happier than I thought it would.
"Well obviously you'll have steel toes, gloves, and a hard hat.  Also a safety vest.  Just a safety vest. "
The pillow dam he built is a pretty clear and non subtle sign that he didn’t like it. 
"Our windows were open, so the neighbours heard and then concernedly/nosily came over after I got back from the hospital to see if everything was alright  "
"Did you get out of it?  You are definitely experiencing rebound anxiety on top of your usual anxiety, so your thoughts of this being a nightmare situation are exaggerated in your mind, its really not that bad.  When you come out of your room just go for a run to settle down and then apologize for being so forward and then you can either own it and admit you do think he's cute and ask him to coffee or to go for a walk or just let it go."
"Just a classic ""somebody has to be blamed"" scenario. Except that unfortunately, there were already a lot of things going on for that teacher and this caused a domino effect to his life. "
"Tossing the salad means a rim job, not masturbation. "
"&gt;watery shit exploded out of my asshole right at the front door of the restaurant.

This description made me laugh like a 4 year old"
"I recommend locking, supervising students sex might get you in trouble."
"Human flesh. It started with simple dandruff, but once they acquired the taste of man flesh, they would all take bites of the various people in OP's house at night, always being careful to leave no trace but little by little growing stronger and larger in the process. Their first step was to become powerful enough to eat OP's pets but soon after they planned to devour the entire family. What OP didn't know is those 4 were just decoys, the original 4 had become too grotesque and large to fool anyone, so every so often new ones took the place as more and more of the giant wolf spiders began living inside the walls. "
"But like, don't take the list of clients. That's how you get fucked. Corporate espionage is a bitch"
"I have a big head and little arms. I'm not sure how well this plan was well thought through.

...

Master?"
"The poor insect bastards who walked into the house, which the spiders dispatched, before they became a problem."
"&gt;Just as we got in ome of the first rooms, our tour guide excuses herself and steps out for a second

""Hey everyone please step inside this gas chamber and stay here while I leave the room for a bit."""
