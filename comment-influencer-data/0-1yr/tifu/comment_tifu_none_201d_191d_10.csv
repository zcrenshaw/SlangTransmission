"&gt; Puerto Pounder is now my PSN gamer tag. He saw it one time and had the most satisfying dad laugh over it.

I've never, and will never, met your dad, but I like him already."
POST Traumatic Stuffing Disorder?
Parent Turkey Stuffing Dad
"Unrelated but my friend's girlfriend's dad used to have ""superseed"" as his username because he had twins."
"There is also an element of strong communication.  You don't usually get to the point of hog tied and penetrated while taking pictures without deeply discussing a few things first.  With healthy BDSM, you have to be very good at communicating boundaries, as well as letting your partner know what does and does not work. 

 Since, ostensibly, OP's parents are getting along outside of the bedroom, it stands to reason that their bedroom antics are healthy, too."
"This is great. Not so similar story but similar to the thread.

My dad was an artist in life. Relatively known in his field. Young women would ask/send nudes to be used as references in art.  So when he passed away I inherited art rights and his pc and phone (which was on my account anyway) and oh boy.

I at least was prepared. But there was a lot of wading through porn because my dad didn't believe in file management. I'd find important files next to 6 images of Tina in different poses and lingerie. 

And worse still, was a woman or two contacted me to let me know *why* my dad would possess nudes of them because they were worried it would be construed as an affair or naughtiness. (Most were in relationships but big fans) or that I would find it horrifying my father had girls younger than myself sending him sexy pics.

I had to confess I knew they were there. I knew my father very well.  I also do art and wasn't shocked by anything I saw except..

One thing.

His browser history had trap porn. Which, my dad wasn't precisely homophobic but you could tell he was uncomfy with the idea.  I know why now.

/shrug

I guess at least I can't say I am mentally scarred by it. I expected to find naked people on his pc. I expected to see more than I wanted to. But it hilariously made it easier to deal with going through his files after his death because it was sort of funny."
true love is also exploring each other‚Äôs bodies in ways both are comfortable participating in 
My grandpa fucked till he died at the ripe old age of 93. When he was living in the old person home he had like 3 girlfriends all at the same time who knew about each other. Had something like 7 of them die. I have been told old people homes are just petri dishes of STD's.
I'd imagine you'd be pretty content with life knowing that at 71 you still have someone who likes to play with your chocolate starfish
This shit again? Lol apparently no one leaned the lesson the first 300 times
"Normally I just read and move along, but.. 

What. The. Fuck.."
"Yep. We‚Äôve been married for 23 years, &amp; we‚Äôre still discovering new stuff to do to each other... I mean with. WITH each other. And shit‚Äôs sagging, but we don‚Äôt care! "
"This isnt on you OP. It on her for being so attached to her own religion that they idea that you feel differently upsets her. Stick to your guns. She is gonna find out eventually that you are atheist.

Dont know how old you are, but you are your own person. Your parents need to learn to accept that. "
This is some funny shit. 
"Your mistake was the hand sanitizer. You don't put alcohol on your junk.  All that aside, if I was a dude, I'd fuck a watermelon instead. "
"We have all been Puerto Pounded on this, the day of my Puerto Pounding üëè"
She is being manipulative. Stay strong and don‚Äôt back down on this but show you care about her in other ways. 
" At least you knew.

When my dad passed away a couple of months ago I learned he was a hoarder and amongst the hoard was a book case of neatly organized VHS porn tapes. About half were commercially produced, had the tape sleeves and all. The other half were recorded...

There were loads of printed sheets of paper clearly printed by an old person. Lots of thumbnails arranged on a page, y'know? Of very kinky con non con stuff. Someone liked the ""forced"" and ""teen"" tags. 

Also found was a knock off fleshlight with some electronic capabilities, well used. And some of those gummy rings that are knobbled in neon colours...

While going through his financial stuff I learned that he regularly sent money to a site for ""foreign brides"".

All stuff I could have done without knowing. "
My father is a very likable man. I am not surprised by this. It's hard to dislike the man. Thank you though. Im glad everyone seems to like this story lol.
that's fucking nuts.
"&gt;My wife is a reddit user and knows her husband posted this from the commute detail. She didn't believe me so she temporarily created a FetLife account so I could, for once, be right.   Now she is very distraught and has told me she can never look at my parents the same. What do? 

LOL. Eve ate from the tree of knowledge and found she didn't like the taste. "
"It's like every day. Is ""genital damage free writing to reddit"" a requirement in college now? "
"OK, as their kid that sucks you had to see this.

But stepping outside of that, your parents have a free, crazy, and active sex life even in their older years.  Something we all are hoping for.  Be happy for them but avoid thinking of the details."
"Come on man, *no one* wants to see their parents fuck, or be reminded that they do. "
I appreciate this comment to its fullest extent.
Hand sanitizer dude? Lmfao lotion works too
"First off, any pain your mom feels isn't your fault. She has to take responsibility for her own reaction and feelings. You can't really make her feel a specific emotion. If that were possible I wouldn't be depressed most of the time because my friends would be able make me happy. 

Secondly, anyone who has read the story in Genesis should know that God gave us free will. It  is your decision to make. 

I understand you don't want to make your mother unhappy, but in the end you need to consider your own happiness as well.  If you can be happy lying to her for the rest of your life, more power to you. But you being miserable because of having to lie out of guilt is likely to poison your long-term relationship with her. Best to pull the band-aid off now so you have plenty of time to rebuild. "

"to most people, trust and sex is a massive part of true love. most because i know asexual people exist and can love but out of all the ___sexuals, sex can be largely related with love (it can also be separated at times but when barriers come down sexually and trust is built (emotionally and sexually), you tend to be madly in love with them)"

Thankfully my dad is dead so I don‚Äôt have to worry about this. 
"This is hysterical and I would literally shit a megaton of bricks if this happened to me. At the end of the day you have to remember, your parents are just ordinary people. Everybody has their kinks and shit that they do for kicks. Try not to be a prude. I know, easier said than done."

"Do not feel bad for having a different faith. She believes in God because she sees that as the smallest leap of faith. You choose science because that is the smallest leap of faith for you. It is what it is. I hope you understand her perspective too though. As a Christian, I pray for my dad to accept Christ often, because I want to spend eternity with him.. and I want what I believe would be best for him. It‚Äôs selfish because that is not what he believes is best for himself. It truly is out of love, but you should never be forced into it. I hope you find a proper way to talk to your mother about this, as I can see you love her very much. She may never understand and that‚Äôs okay, but you could still encourage her faith to keep the connection there. My dad does this for me.. asks me how Church was, my youth group, etc. Goodluck my friend."

"Ok, there‚Äôs kind of a difference. American here, and I can tell you that there is an obvious problem with crime. You are 100% right on that aspect. But it‚Äôs not like I live every day with a shadow of terror. It‚Äôs not like I fear getting shot every time I leave the house. There are serious gun problems- but it‚Äôs not THAT serious. There are 350 million people in America, so these crimes that sound consistent are still diffused between a few hundred million humans. It‚Äôs more like a slight concern I have once in a while than a shadow of dread or a looming terror.

That said, I‚Äôm not saying America doesn‚Äôt need fixing. The crime is still a serious problem, but let‚Äôs not get too political about that. All I want to say is that as serious as, it is it still isn‚Äôt something that regularly happens to anyone and everyone you know - more like a freak incident that often makes the news."

"I‚Äôm a little late, but I wanted to recommend you check out this website [Ask A Manager](https://www.askamanager.org). She posts advice and answers workplace questions as someone with extensive office experience, particularly as a manager. You could write in and ask for advice, though I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôd get a reply that quickly. Pursuing the archives, however, I found a few letters that might be of interest, even if the perspectives are a little different. And I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more, this is just what I found in a brief search. [One](https://www.askamanager.org/2013/07/my-manager-over-shares-about-his-personal-life-and-i-want-him-to-stop.html), [two](https://www.askamanager.org/2013/09/coworker-accidentally-called-me-to-complain-about-me.html), and [three](https://www.askamanager.org/2018/01/my-employee-accidentally-sent-a-rude-message-about-me-to-me.html). 

As I said, these may not be quite right for you. But it can help to see how out of the ordinary his behavior is. I included the first link as well just to give perspective on what he may be thinking when you were talking - that doesn‚Äôt excuse his behavior, but it might help to try to see it differently."

Also your conversation sounds very tame. I wouldn't worry about what you said at all. I bet your boss spends years cringing about that email he sent because he was being silly and unprofessional.

This is a chance to show how mature you are. On Tuesday tell him it's no big deal and go about your business as usual. "

One of the ringleaders would try to blame me for things that happened on days I wasn't there (pre-approved time).  She would outright lie and people would believe her.  She would torture a target until the person left.  One had to take stress leave due to a breakdown from the bullying.  Yet they still kept her miserable self employed.  I left because of it and she had the nerve to complain I left at a bad time!  And I gave a full two weeks notice.  

&amp;#x200B;

After I left, they tried to accuse me of not letting them know about who an order I placed before leaving was supposed to go to.  One of her supervisors (also my former supervisor) called the main line at my new job and took a snotty tone.  

I mentioned that it was in the physical location where we were supposed to leave such things and that I had stated that information in my pending email I sent to the whole group on my last day there.  I told her the information on the phone rather than making her hunt for it, but I also told her I'd resend a copy of the email to her (I had emailed myself a copy) in case anything else came up.  I could hear the cat bitch face over the phone.  "
Holy shit. You‚Äôre manager is a total douche. Please let this go. It‚Äôs nothing to dell no. Your manager is like most. Immature and childish at best 
"There is a process to go through when someone makes you uncomfortable at work. This is a classic example. While he didn't do anything wrong, his boss did cross the line, and I think he stepped way over the line. He is now uncomfortable and it needs to be addressed. HR needs to be a part of that discussion. There are so many things that could be going on in the background that our hero does not know about."
Your boss has the personality of a rock. 
Better being a managing director than man who collects the shopping carts around the parking lot.
"I hope your boss's career flashed before his eyes when he realized what he'd done.

 I am used to working for very large corporations that have very active HR departments that ensure no one is creating a hostile work environment for any employee, definitely people in management are help in super strict check. No question this boss would be fired if he worked for the health care organization I work for. Unfortunately it seems your company may not be as strict with their managers, or maybe don't even have an HR. Anyhow, it ticks me off. He should be demoted if not fired, as a manager you can't gossip about your coworkers on company email FFS. He's a douchebag AND an idiot (prime manager material). 

Ad others have said DEFINITELY report to work on Monday. If you take him up on his ""offer"" he will probably think he's bought your silence, or worst case scenario turn on you as a no call no show (though I doubt that, since you have email proof that incriminates him as badly).

Good for you for trying to openly confront it. I would have just glared forever and resented it silently, while he pretended it never happened. You did nothing wrong except try to have a conversation. I try to talk to my friends about my dreams and They think I'm weird. Lesson learned. But I hope your boss gets punished somehow. "
"Do not take Monday off! He's probably using that day to get HR to hear only him out and then telling them you didn't show up to work at all. 

Go to work, send that email to your personal email ASAP to keep on hand. Keep what you said on hand in case he tries to find something to get rid of you for him embarrassing himself. 

Again, go to work Monday. "

"You'll be a super famous comedian and I'll remember this reddit post and be like ""Yeah, I was there."" Best of luck to you!"
"Well, remember how he was given the day off - over the phone after work hours. There's no official record of the off day and is pretty much all dependant on the boss if OP gets in trouble or not. Too much could go wrong in my eyes if he takes the day off, unless there is no HR or anything like that which handles matters like employee leave."
"Don't worry about it, you're actually still dreaming right now. You got so good at lucid dreaming that you can't tell the difference between dreams and reality.

You'll wake up soon and 8 hours will just have flown by. And if you don't, just go super saiyan and kamehameha your boss out of a window."
It was someone from a another school.
"Pretty much. Sometimes when something happens in the work place you have to choose your battles with hr. Ask yourself what they would actually do in this situation especially since it was meant to be a private conversation. They‚Äôd give him a slap on the wrist. He wouldn‚Äôt get wrote up. He definitely wouldn‚Äôt get fired. HR would just come back and say ‚Äúwe talked to him about it, let us know if anything else happens‚Äù
Just keep your screen shot."
"Monday off serves 2 purposes.

1. Make up for what he did.
2. Contact HR and cover his ass. Admitting he did it to them before you report it will protect his career.

Email him and say ""just confirming approval for Monday off, please respond with answer"" will cover you for not being in the office.

He's a dick also BTW."
Haaa exactly 10 mins with me and he would be running to the hills.
"Uh, gang gang for sure."
Just MAYBE the email was not sent to the wrong person.
actually your boss seems worse kind of person. He‚Äôs absent minded clearly AND he bitches about employees that too on company email. red flags all around. 
"Imagine being bigger than dreams, what a tool that boss is. "
"You dont write stories on reddit like this if you dont want the creep attention....just sayin

&amp;#x200B;"
Laughed so hard at ‚ÄúI travel the world and the seven seas‚Äù. These lyrics legit apply to OP!
"I wouldn't let that ruin my weekend, pretty normal stuff you talked about AND got a free 3 day weekend. Put that in the fucking W column my friend "
Yeah we all did... Because that's what they were referencing. 
Hornyfying
It is true in FL at least. When I was 16 I stole $15 worth of crap from WalMart and had to pay a $400 fine.
"That email is not what I expected at all, it‚Äôs not even really rude it‚Äôs actually kind of funny lol, I wouldnt even be mad if I was you."
"OP, please forward that email to HR. I‚Äôm sure your boss is a lovely guy, but if someone without the sense of humor you posses would have received that email, what would they do? I‚Äôm afraid if you do nothing it allows your boss to do this time and time again when it is not appropriate. Do you really want to continue working for someone who says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be alone with him‚Äù? "
"47 here and it's funny to me how much my kids and much younger husband don't get that it's our generation that first came up on all this shit! We were the first that as we came up, said, ""you know what, I'm not leaving this behind just because I'm growing up""! I think we've got the best of everything. Saturday morning cartoons when we were really little, then everything that came along in our early 20s. "
"This.

I have a clear delineation with coworkers... if at one point we end up at a bar drinking, that changes where they stand. If we are joy in the same city but would definitely end up at a bar drinking, that changes where they stand... other wise, keep a distance. This even means two separate FB profiles, instagram profiles, etc. "
"Your boss is a weak man, it seems. "
"You didn't FU, your boss did. What you shared sounds like an interesting and totally normal conversation. On the other hand he revealed to you that he is a gossipy asshat with a closed mind who can't be trusted and must be boring as snot. I wouldn't worry about your weekend, if you get fired for this conversation you'd have a pretty righteous wrongful termination suit."
"Dude - I'd love to sit and talk to you about lucid. Dreaming and even """"wierder"" shit. He's a boring asshole. Take a step back and look it from the perspective that you're not a man who gets weirded out by normal conversational stuff. Better than talking about the weather? You're better than him"
Well that‚Äôs good to know. I know first hand how enabling parents can be sometimes and how they compartmentalize things. They don‚Äôt want to admit there‚Äôs a problem or admit something might be wrong with their kid. So they rationalize it rather than addressing it head on. In the long run they do more harm than good until it does get to the point where it needs to be addressed 
"This. Fucking hate car dreams. Breaks dead, steering sucks, I'm too small to reach anything, and we're careening down busy roads at 100mph. Fuck that!"
"Dude what? No. Absolutely not.

You realize Op could get him fired if he wanted to? There is absolutely no way that he is trying to fire OP. This advice is crazy.

I‚Äôd be taking that Monday off with open arms. OP is the one who has dirt on his boss"
"Oh, he likes you it sounds like. "
"I wanted to upvote, but you already had 420 and I didn't want to ruin it"
"Maybe it's not just what he said, but how he said it? "
On top of being embarrassed by his own behavior he also feels incompetent. As well maybe he is unsure if OP is going to go to HR about the incident and he is unsure how to diffuse it and just wants it to go away. The less he has to see OP in his mind the better until it blows over so that is probably why he gave him Monday off...
Sue him lol
"Omg OP why'd you leave me with this guy, he's such a weirdo pls don't do it again"
those sound like really fun dreams lol
My dad is almost 60 and he went to Star Trek conventions when he was a kid.
"Sounds like your boss is trying to cover his ass by giving you a day off, probably hopes you dont talk to HR about his email. 

But I would tell HR... fuck that guy. "
That's not even weird shit...
He's squidward and you're spongebob
Meow bitch
Talking about random interesting topics like that are always so fun anyways! Especially with someone you don‚Äôt know that well. Hearing another humans thoughts on things only stands as a gain for both because you might hear an opinion or idea you‚Äôve never thought of before and that can lead to another thought etc. 
"My goodness, I am so sorry your boss is such a dick. Take that Monday off in pride. Do things that make you happy this weekend and try to enjoy it as much as possible. You did nothing wrong, just making conversation....which was totally not weird by the way. "
He reminds me of a generic bad guy in a kids movie that hates fun and imagination. Who would have ever guessed those people actually exist! 
Yeah thc effects your sleep cycle so people who smoke often dont dream/remember their dreams and people who quit smoking often experience trouble sleeping because their dreams coming back is super overwhelming.
This is a boss who doesn't deserve to be one.  
"Septuple down, make him have dreams of you."
My new brother was named Jaxxson :(
"Dude I fucking wish i could make deposits at the bank. 

Best dream ever. "
Your boss is a jackass
"On the other hand, I‚Äôm reminded of this quote from Michael Scott:

&gt; I spent all day trying to make her like me that I forgot to ask myself something, do I even like her?
"
One of the directors at my company is a cultural em assault to Japan and still doesn't believe it's culturally acceptable IN JAPAN for adults to like anime. 
THFU. Today he fucked up
"Wow!! I mean no disrespect at all but That‚Äôs actually kinda funny to picture. 

Girl removes part from car, has friend look it up, it‚Äôs a temp sensor, next part a abs sensor, next an O2 sensor, Until there‚Äôs a pile of ‚Äúextra‚Äù parts on the floor and the only thing remaining still attached is the frame, engine and tires. 
"
"I'd hate to say it, but this shows what other people at the company think about you.  At least the people listed in the email.  They've certainly talked behind your back in a negative way before.  If you like your job, don't make this a big deal unless you need to use it as leverage.  Your boss will always fear what you can do with that email.  If you don't like your job, I'd consider leaving since you clearly don't have a great reputation and some people don't respect you. "
"I don't know about down there, but in the U.S. at my husband's company, a manager got into major hot water for accidentally sending a derogatory email to the person he was talking to.  The whole thing ended up in H.R. If you feel like he crossed a line with shit talking (especially the ""don't ever leave me with him alone again"") maybe you should bring it up to H.R."
Today your boss fucked up
Show it to HR. Fuck that prick. 
"Ambrose!! I adore him. Yeah, pretty much everyone but Sabrina haha. I quite like Prudence, she's the only young'un on the show I can stand."
Save that e mail. Crap that is great for HR to have :)
"OP this will be lost on comment and probs already comments but boss is def giving you Monday off for being a dick in a professional setting. Most guys like that aren‚Äôt going to apologize and rather give you something to compensate. I would not worry about loosing your job, especially if your work product can‚Äôt be called into question.

Enjoy your day off!"
"Exactly they've got investigative resources too. 

Like this whole 'pre-trial' bail bonding service this county is doing. I'm not certain, but I bet we can find some anti-trust violations. They are undercutting the local bail bonding industry in a predatory way. 

I bet there is a record of revenue both before this pre trial system and after...I haven't seen the numbers but my guess is that profits for the county went up and conviction rates went sky high! 

So now the county can appear tough on crime because look at all these convictions. 98% conviction rate looks good for re-election. And the profit motive is obvious. 

The same judge signed every single warrant for everyone that was locked up in there. One single court issue warrants, then rounds people up, funnel them through a harsher than normal booking process that inherently steps on civil liberties...like being charged with a crime BEFORE stepping foot in jail...not sitting in jail for 72 hours while LE figure out what charges will stick. Etc. 

I bet with just minor investigative resources, we could blow up a multi-million dollar prosecution ratchet. If this entire county jail isn't breaking the law, then they are walking a very thin line. "
maybe OP downplayed the weirdness?
Letting a woman handle his finances... someone's got money to burn. Any opinion on Jamaican ladies ?
I think he's the weirdo. Who doesn't have weird dreams? Or talk about time travel. What a dick.
Your boss seems like a boring square. I look forward to him realizing he sent you that message and feeling (rightfully) like a bit of an a-hole. Maybe he'll be less judgemental in the future.
That was incredibly unprofessional
"It's a bold move but also very stupid. There is nothing to be gained from intentionally pissing off your boss in this situation, even if you're in the right. Just let it go if it's a one time thing. If it happens repeatedly then you can go talk to HR. If your boss is a dick, you might want to start looking for another job anyway."
"I love talking about lucid dreaming. It‚Äôs a pretty cool topic and experience. Don‚Äôt know why that is weird to people, but it is for some reason. "
Sounds like he‚Äôs a hater
Lmao very dedicated!  I'd gold u but im just a poor reddit farmer.
Exactly I was thinking if the craziest thing this dude has heard of is a person flying in their dream he would think a lot of people are borderline insane with the wacky dreams you can have. 
"&gt; The boss‚Äô extreme reaction is odd.

&gt; The extra Monday off is suspicious.

You hit the nail on the head with both, I wish I could give more than one upvote  so this would come higher up.

&gt;  If that is how a boss is describing an employee, there‚Äôs no way he can give a fair annual review now.

Huh. Didn't even think of this. Fully agreed."
But... Ubers and taxis...

Why would you send a email about something like this? It‚Äôs 2019 everyone knows you at least text or use snapchat if you‚Äôre going to talk smack about someone behind their back!!!
Sounds like your boss was the one with the fuck up by sending an e-mail to the wrong person. And for being a backstabbing bitch.
Current working at Target and I kind of wish something like this would happen to me just to make my day the slightest bit interesting
He gave you Monday off cause he feels like a dick and hopes you will forget about the whole thing by tuesday
"No need to be sorry, I guarantee theres plenty of us who have done this or felt this way man you arent alone, keep your head up itll be better. "
I second this recommendation
That's what I'm saiyan too
Your boss is a judgemental piece of shit. 
"Yeah man for real. The whole reddit world feels so unbelievable sorry for any fucking negative thing someone happened. ‚ÄûDont worry its not your fault‚Äú, ‚Äûhe is the weirdo not you‚Äú. WTF. Ask yourself, would you REALLY talk about your dreams with your BOSS?! I mean he clearly said ‚Äûwe dont speak much‚Äú and the first thing you bring up is to talk about your dreams and that dreams are time travels? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ reddit is a rainbow place for unicorns.

Do not take monday off. Go to work. He's a jerk but now you know.

 !RemindMe 3days
Agreed-we don‚Äôt know how OP is. Imagine how much different the conversation is if OP made all those segues without his boss saying anything. He could have just ranted from one point to the next and the guy is just like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never starting a conversation with this guy again.‚Äù
"True, but if OP doesn't show up for work without proof he or she was told to take the day off, that's fired for cause.  That could be the difference between receiving unemployment and not receiving it in some jurisdictions. 

In OP's shoes, I would start looking for another job."

Probably wants you to not come in on Monday as a way to save himself an extra day of embarassment, could also be he‚Äôs trying to get you fired for not showing up, OR could also be any of the other reasons listed here.

Don‚Äôt tell HR, go in on Monday like normal. If he asks just say you feel no need to take the day off. If you act like it‚Äôs not a big deal it should blow over. Then, archive that bad boy and keep it in the back burner, and don‚Äôt trust your boss again with personal talk. That was super unprofessional of him to use WORK email for PERSONAL stuff.

"I think there is a pretty easy solution. On tuesday, in passing (don't make a thing of it) tell him you are sorry you weirded him out with a talk off the deep end. Not all people are deep or philisophical and they often are very uncomfortable with deep talk.  Let him know the situation is still cool and to disregard the email. After that just treat him like a shallow and dumb bro and be done with it. Now you know the type of person he is."
Don‚Äôt go to HR. They are there to protect the company not you. And don‚Äôt take Monday off. Preserve the email in some way and pretend this all didn‚Äôt happen. If you get let go you have proof of unfair dismissal. 
Such a weird phenomenon. Most times I have issues with the vehicle sliding (on regular pavement) that I can't make turns or end up crashing because I can't break in time.

Does this guy even dream?
Its so hard to know what you can talk about with managers and even coworkers.
"I would say I hope he is on Reddit and sees this post, but seeing of how he thinks OP‚Äôs talk was weird, I doubt it. Or he does Reddit and doesn‚Äôt go on very many subs outside his tiny mind."
"Agree. I know co-workers who believe in government mind-control.  What OP said sounds pretty normal. Then again, I hang out with a bunch of geeks. "
"Good new, you got your boss pinned over a barrel. Proceed to fuck shit up."
You're boss is a douche lol 
You guys don't want to be cute girls?
Is this a joke
"What the hell? Is there something else you guys talked about? Like I'm even trying to play devil's advocate here but I don't see how anyone could find REM sleep and talking about dreams weird. My only thought is that maybe he thought you were referring to highs on drugs? Even then though, you said he was interested in the topic of REM sleep so if assume he knows what lucid dreaming is. "
"I would bet your boss has some crazy weird dreams that he is self conscious about.  Somebody bringing it up makes him awkward and defensive. Often the ""weakness"" you see in others is something you don't like about yourself."
"That's what gets me. After a conversation, even if weird, his first thought is tell someone how weird he thinks someone is? It's like he's in Highschool  "
Like dude. If I had a dream in whoch I'd turned Super Saiyan. Fuck!! Even False Super Saiyan. I'd make bigass hoardings about it!!!

Do they just give out MD titles now?  ‚ÄúDude‚Äù seems like a real pro
"Exactly! Wasn't IT, but my last job had 2 guys that would constantly talk shit about everyone else including the boss, and they would lie about a lot of things. Then everyone else including the boss knew that they would lie about things and talk shit about all of them, so everyone else ends up talking shit about the 2 guys also. Then because I was new they always invited me to hang out with them. I would never hang out with people like that, because I already know they talk shit about everyone else. In fact I haven't really made friends with any co-workers ever since I got out of the military.  "
How is that weird? We can‚Äôt control our dreams (usually)
Your boss sounds mean spirited... He already made up his mind to not like you and he went ahead and tried to make fun of you for his own amusement.  He's an asshole.

My only two cents on the HR issue depends on context. If this dude has given flack before maybe it's time to say something. Otherwise this is correct. 
I'm average in every way.

What the fuck was weird about what you said?  I feel the same way about dreams and shit.  Ever take Melatonin?  Crazy lucid dreams can result!
"Yeah, he was making a kind hearted conversation and then gets disrespected like this."
"I think the only mistake you made was calling him afterwards.  The correct thing to do in these situations is just ignore it.  If he wants to talk to you about it, let him come to you.  He knows he fucked up, no amount of talking will fix it.  

And I say just ignore it, but I also counsel you to keep that email in a very safe place for the day you need it.  You might need a little leverage of your own if you screw up.  And you will, because we all do."
"What?  Why are *you* worried?  You have a little leverage over this douche, now.  That‚Äôs why he is acting like a fuckstick now.  *DO NOT* take Monday off.  He‚Äôs attempting to even the score.  We need to figure out a subtle way for you to make fun of him to his face about his clumsy, idiotic email mistake.  Not to make too big of a thing about it, but this guy is an incompetent clutz, and now he knows you know it.  The tables are turned *on him*.  Let him know that you see him, but that you are magnanimous, and will only rib him about it privately.  Bring it up to him in a joking but subtly aggressive way once every 4 months.  Grin like a wolf."
Has he never had a dream before?
Most police stations actually have internet exchange points right in front of them in clear view of cameras for this type of stuff 
Get In Der Son!!!!!!!‚Äô
"Sorry dude. That's shitty. It sounds like youve been the but of their jokes for a while as well. Def come in on Monday. As someone who went to such great lengths to avoid talking about their shitty behavior so far, and the fact its been happening in the first place,  i wouldn't trust him. Also, please update later!"
"When the car no longer functions properly, will she finally believe people?? I bet she'll just say, ""The gov't is onto me, they know I found the sensors, and they're shutting off my car remotely!"""
"Son, never trust a man who doesn't dream because he's probably a self-righteous sort, a man who thinks he knows right from wrong all the time. Some of them are good men, but in the name of goodness, they cause most of the suffering in the world. They're the judges, the meddlers. And, son, never trust a man who dream but refuses to lucid dream. They're usually afraid of something deep down inside, either that they're a coward or a fool or mean and violent. You can't trust a man who's afraid of himself. But sometimes, son, you can trust a man who occasionally turns himself into a Super Saiyan. The chances are that he is learning something about humility and his natural human foolishness, about how to survive himself. It's damned hard for a man to take himself too seriously when he's flying through the air with spikey blonde hair. "
Today his boss fucked up. I don't think there's a subreddit for that yet...
"It's always the damn walls. 
Similar happened to me with my gf too, I was sitting on top of her thighs with my feet holding her arms back while I tickled her sides, she got some superhuman strength and literally sent me flying forwards head first into the wall. 
Didn't have a concussion, but a nice headache from that one... we still laugh and argue about whose fault it is "
"My response was to the armchair psychologist, I wasn't defending the email at all dude. "
"Man. That boss is one pos if this is what he considers justifiable. If the OP is doing well at work, I would hope the boss would know better than to do something this stupid. "
Haha I've unintentionally  kicked someone in the face before for tickling my feet.  I do NOT enjoy it and flail pretty hard.  You would think they learned their lesson from that.   But they did not.
"Take Monday off...

Your boss is a dick. Why fuckin' ruin someone's weekend like that."
I live Garlic.

"That doesn't really make sense. You can't fire someone for being ""weird"" and he did nothing wrong speaking about dreams. The other person is in the wrong for making inapporpriate comments about a colleague. He also has the copy of the email, so if they try and fire him he has himself covered. "
This sounds like a TMBFU rather than a TIFU. Haha!
"""Never leave me alone with this person again""

How is that not rude...?"
Your boss sounds like a square
"I mean, if you‚Äôre not from the US I think you‚Äôre just set up to have a difficult time understanding why most of us don‚Äôt just run there in the first place. It‚Äôs a crappy injury and had it been during the day, I‚Äôd have immediately gone to an urgent care but it wasn‚Äôt nearly severe enough, looking back, to drop a stupid amount of money in the er on something that‚Äôs not really going to change the healing process. "
"As a manger, we pretty much receive training to never say sorry. It crappy but it lowers lawsuit risk since an apology can be used as an admission of guilt. As other have said, don‚Äôt talk to HR, Thier job is to protect the company. "
Do you still have the cats?
FWIW - he is the one f'ing up here not you. He shouldn't ever talk like that about his own staff and anyone with half a brain knows not to put it in writing. Ducking out of the office early and throwing a vacation day at you is super weird. You did well opening up; he did poorly reacting to it.
That's really fucking childish and unprofessional of him to do tbh
"Hey.   He's probably super embarrassed and/or mortified.   AND people sometimes do odd things to try to protect themselves after having done something dumb.... like terminate the employment of the person they maligned.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are in any way concerned that that could happen, you might want to swing by your work this weekend and gather up 1) copies of performance reviews, complimentary emails, awards, accommodations 2) anything you don't want left in the office if you were summarily dismissed.   Just think to yourself ""what would I really want to have and no longer have access to (phone lists come to mind) if I was terminated""

&amp;#x200B;

\#IMightBeParanoid"
This kind of shit is exactly why I don‚Äôt trust anyone. Better to be quiet and have no one know you at all than to open up and have them talk shit behind your back. 
"Damn, sorry to hear about the issues beforehand but I'm glad you were able to find a fix. That's awesome you were able to come to it naturally. Sounds like your mind decided to kick in some natural instinct and make you aware without practice to get you some good night sleep from now on! 

Yea, the sleep paralysis is nuts.. Especially feeling the presence of another person (I live alone). I imagine your dreams beforehand were probably just as bad though.

Thank you for sharing!"
"You‚Äôd be really surprised how many people out there lead extremely tight, normal lives and anything off the beaten path makes them so unbearably uncomfortable in ways you can‚Äôt really wrap your head around, because you‚Äôre a weirdo and all this stuff is normal banter to you.

To them, it‚Äôs plausible reason to fire someone.  Just because you‚Äôre that weird.

OP needs to start looking for work."
seriously. ive made everyone at my job passionately gay with each other singlehandedly. most of us are married already and yet we flirt with each other and smack asses. Weird yes but sometimes telling a more awkward story makes you feel better. Were all men btw.
"Your boss is your typical milquetoast suburban basic bro, I wouldn‚Äôt sweat it, this isn‚Äôt that weird. "
"What you said wasnt weird. Its normal, what the hell is that manager talking about? That manager is the weird one, and an asshole for talking about you like that. I would sue the shit out of him for defamation of character."
You seem like a cool guy. I'd hang out with you.
I think it's safe to say that your boss is weird.
"This!  And this is why I hate office socializing.  It can be fun with the right people, but not people like this.

OP, you did nothing wrong.  Your boss is the one who fu.  I would confirm that you have the day off though, just to be safe.  Guy sounds like the kind of sneaky asshole who might try to sabotage you.    


""Hope you're having a good weekend. Following up to confirm that per our phone conversation on x date at y time, you told me to take today off.  If this has changed, please let me know and I will come in on Monday.""

I wouldn't worry, but I would update my resume and see what's out there.  I don't he's going to immediately fire you, but he doesn't sound trustworthy, so I wouldn't put it past him to build a case against you.  

Can't hurt to see what else is out there.  And if he does play dirty, you're set to hit the ground running with your resume.  


My suggestion for office socializing is pay attention to people's interests and stories about their families/pets.  Then ask them about it and let them do most of the talking.  Have a few mainstream and predictable, but not personal topics.  Mainstream popular tv shows/music, hobbies, etc.  You seem social but don't give much away."
"Sue his ass!  Discrimination in the work place, racial profiling, and sexual harassment."
This really is solid advice. If this guy really is as much of a twat as he sounds then I wouldn‚Äôt put it past him to pull this. Go to work Monday.
"What ""chip"" does he have and why is this email ""potentially a problem"" for his boss? It is not illegal for bosses to gossip. Bad form but not illegal. There is nothing to indicate OP is anything other than an at-will employee. It is 100% legal to fire someone for absolutely no reason, OR for the reason ""he's a weirdo."" Unless OP has some negative employment action taken against him that would violate the law by being discriminatory, violating an employment contract, etc., the boss may have been a jerk, but has done nothing illegal whatsoever. How would OP use this as a ""chip"" in the future? Quite possible I missed the smoking gun detail, though. 

I always tell my clients that your boss can wake up one day and decide to fire everyone who drives a blue car just because he wants to, and that's perfectly legal. Having a blue car is not a legally protected category like sex, race, religion, and neither is being a lucid dreamer.

Please help me out to see where the problematic behavior is, not just boss being a jerk. Thank you"
Your boss sounds basic.

"Start documenting everything. Print out copies of all correspondence and date them. Forward the email to HR, ethics, or maybe the manager above your boss. Even better if you've got an option to report these things privately. Tell them you're concerned about the way you are being discussed by your direct superior. Tell them that when you asked him about it he told you to take Monday off and you'd talk about it Tuesday. I wouldn't want to take the weekend off and have him hamming it up with HR. At that point he controls the conversation and you're at a very disadvantaged position.

&amp;#x200B;

If anything comes up as an issue on Tuesday, then contact a lawyer. A letter from a legal office tends to change these conversations. It will cost you a few clams, but it is very likely a worthwhile expense.

&amp;#x200B;

Either way your relationship with your boss is going to be weird from here on out. If it was honestly just a dumb mistake, then it'll probably just be weirdness. If not, then you'll be under a microscope as he tries to find little things to ding you for to make a case for termination. He'll just have to be very wary of doing anything that could be seen as retaliatory. That's a day in court your company doesn't want. If they do fire you in the near future you could also consider the lawyer route."
"Son, never trust a man who doesn't drink because he's probably a self-righteous sort, a man who thinks he knows right from wrong all the time. Some of them are good men, but in the name of goodness, they cause most of the suffering in the world. They're the judges, the meddlers. And, son, never trust a man who drinks but refuses to get drunk. They're usually afraid of something deep down inside, either that they're a coward or a fool or mean and violent. You can't trust a man who's afraid of himself. But sometimes, son, you can trust a man who occasionally kneels before a toilet. The chances are that he is learning something about humility and his natural human foolishness, about how to survive himself. It's damned hard for a man to take himself too seriously when he's heaving his guts into a dirty toilet bowl"

I beg to differ: Ants get the job *done* efficiently by working together. 
Boss man is a chatty Cathy 
That's extremely sweet and patient! Glad there are humans like you around.
"This is more of a ""today my boss fucked up"". You were just having what sounded like an interesting conversation but he was just not an interesting person. Enjoy your 3 day weekend :) "
too confrontational... 
Your boss sounds like the most boring corporate drone. Just saying.
"Target, for when you feel you're too good to shop at Walmart."
I'm gonna say he has never heard of lucid dreaming before. I've even had people think I was talking about wet dreams. 
"You don‚Äôt think someone explaining that they dream about becoming ‚ÄúSuper Saiyan‚Äù is kind of weird if you have no idea what that is? That‚Äôs kind of fucking weird. Boss shouldn‚Äôt have emailed someone saying he was weird, but from his perspective it was probably pretty weird. "
"The email, yes. But what about the phone call where the boss said that about taking Monday off, where is the timestamp for that? Actually there is one about the call itself but not about what was said."
"He gave you the day off to try to win you over so you don't go to HR about him talking shit when he shouldn't be.

If you go to HR, he's going to get a hand slap.  If you don't, you'll always have this to hold over him.

Some people are just judgy dicks, sounds like he has a superiority complex.  If this was me, I'd keep this in my back pocket and every now and then send him an email clearly ment for someone else then follow it with an email like ""Sorry, that was for Susan.  Don't you hate sending emails to the wrong person?"""
Nah things on here get lost in translation. 
Haha oh. My bad. 
"Hope you boss reddits. 

Jay's boss, you're a piece of shit manager, find another job please. "
DUDE
"Tonight on ""You hold his career in your hands"" Damien the boss fucked up and sent a bullying post to the victim."

"Better safe than sorry. You don‚Äôt wanna be the guy laying in a pool of blood and with his final breath says, ‚ÄúI shoulda called the c... bleh.‚Äù

I assume bleh is the sound a death rattle makes."
"There's nothing to go to HR about. Boss was inadvertently a jerk, but certainly doesn't sound like anything legally actionable happened. Bosses can be shitty. They don't have to be nice. He's allowed tk make fun of employee weirdness so long as it's not ""all our Asian workers are weird and J want to fire them all."" Everything indicates OP is an at-will employee, and his boss is a jerk, but there's no law against that. "
Lol. They‚Äôre losers if they‚Äôre still thinking about that. Don‚Äôt let them bring you down!
"&gt; moves at a 15 speeds.

How many Mooches is that?"
"Honestly though, that‚Äôd be a strong move that showed that OP wasn‚Äôt hurt about the email. "
