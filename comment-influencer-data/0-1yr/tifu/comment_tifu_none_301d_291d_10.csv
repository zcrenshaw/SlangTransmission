It's not easy being green.
"Lol dude you made so many bad decisions in such a short amount of time. 


Edit: Not trying to shame the dude. Honestly this is probably the most honest to god New York TIFU I've ever read &amp; its hilarious, I also feel bad. Some of these comments are ridiculous OP, you're not some bad guy. Since I'm top comment I'll try to TL;DR everything &amp; the edits in OPs post with timeline &amp; facts.

OP has 2 jobs. OP applies to a better job. Nothing is really stated as to what OP does before getting home but assuming he gets home late and eats food before 12am.


**10pm-12am:** Gets home &amp; Eats Food.    


**12am-7ish:** Stays up working on schedule and important things.    


**8am-12pm:** OP sleeps and then wakes up for interview. Also skips breakfast or lunch. (**Key Plot Point**)     


**12pm-2pm:** OP gets paid, puts money in savings, leaves to buy marijuana before getting food because dealer is leaving soon.     


**2pm-4pm**: Travelling?    


**4pm-5ish:** Gets to dealer. Decides to see movie (**Key Plot Point**). Rolls up weed at dealers house in safe enviroment and heads out to the movies.         


**5:30:** OP initially plans to get pizza before going to movie but checks movie times/prices, see's the cheaper ticket is closer, trying to be $$ conscious on his fun day off. Realizes the area with the best price is full of police so he cannot smoke outdoors safetly. In a panic he smokes two joints instead of saving one for right before the movie and one right after. (**Key Plot Point**)     

  


**5:30pm-6pm:** Between that time OP gets to the the train and because he's stoned &amp; rushing, decides to not get pizza. Instead he smokes a cigarette expecting to eat while there, complaining about the steps and feeling dizzy.     



**(Important Note) At this point I'd like to point out the things OP complained about. Blurry vision, going blind, dull hearing, dizzyness, walking up the steps alot. After a quick google search of his symptoms, I checked other comments to see if anyone agreed. I'm sure OP's blood sugar dropped dangerously low because they didn't eat. Smoking did not help. Shoulda got the pizza.**      



**6pmish:** OP experiences those symptoms listed above during rush hour on the NYC transit system. Realizes *""I needs to eat something""* but accidentally grabs cookies he's allergic to. Squishes into a train feeling faint and realizes he's eating essentially cookies that can kill him. Instantly turns away from the seat I'd assume was to the left if he stood by the doors and spits it all on some poor kids lap. OP reaches down into his bag (Mistake) to get tissues for the kid as his vision goes black on a moving train. He accidentally slams into the lady who by now thinks the cookie bit was on purpose. Gets beat up and slammed around by angry people who misinterpreted what's happening. OP runs off the train, gets his bearings, finally grabs a sandwich, and takes a cab.     



**6:30ish-8:30** OP watches movie.    


**8:30-10ish:** I'm assumimg OP makes this post in TIFU either on his way home or when he got there.     





**That's the entire post in a nutshell. Hope it helps. I only did this because of the overwhelming amount of top comments judging this guy just because he lives in a shelter without knowing his life. Also OP, always make sure to eat 4-5 small meals a day. Its hard to remember to eat when you work alot, keep your glucose levels in check. Keep doing your best, ignore what all these judgy comments say. I'm rooting for you and stop doing dumb shit like that lol**

"&gt;  mullet got cut off 

The real tragedy here."
I hate to use this cliche but what if the girlfriend was just a figment of OP’s imagination and him using “Thought Erasure” is him getting rid of said girlfriend and coming to grips with reality?
The first part of this was basically just porn

"As someone who lost my mom in high school, I never gave anyone a hard time about it. I even let people say “your momma” jokes without reminding them “my moms dead” why? Because that would be crazy as shit. 

Anyone that would freak out on you is not stable. 

She needs counseling not a boyfriend. She needs to unpack that baggage with a professional. "
"First line says it's her fetish, last line tells the truth."
"my dad's dead. most people don't know that because I don't specifically talk about it. So if the subject comes up; I just say ""oh, he passed away but it's ok"". She basically baited you and you dodged a bullet mate. If I go to his tumb, I'll say it like that or just say I've got something to do"
Fyi. They always find people dead in bathrooms after choking for exactly the reason you give here “I cannot try and throw it up here! There’s food here and it’s embarrassing “ or something. People end up passing out and dying and being discovered later 
"Breaking up with you was a pretty extreme reaction, at face value, so I'm going to assume this was either the last straw after a pattern of behaviour from you, or there's more to this situation.

Otherwise, it was an extremely easy situation to defuse: honestly and sincerely apologize, explain that you just meant it as a lighthearted joke, and you were foolish for saying it so loudly and thotlessly.  Promise not to do that kind of thing again...and actually keep that promise.

Women aren't aliens; communicating like adults is the first step to solving almost any problem in a relationship."
"Repeat after me: ""I'm an idiot and I'm very sorry. There's no excuse for my behavior. I apologize."" She's been boiling for 24 hours, you may as well just *start* with groveling. 

Fuck's sake, son. Take it from an older guy: you *want* to throw yourself on that grenade. You can shitpost later. *If* you survive."
"Years ago my friend and I were eating out and she told me they had this habanero paste that people like to try. I'm a hot sauce fiend, so I was all for it. They bring me a toothpick with a glob of this black goop on the end which looked like resin. Five minutes later, I'm pacing in the parking lot and spitting constantly. I kept going to the bushes because I felt like I had to throw up. It was like Satan had pissed in my mouth. I was out there pacing for well over a half hour looking like I was coming down off of bad drugs or something.

Turns out it was this stuff called ""the source"". 7.1 million fucking scoville heat units. Never again."

"Diary of a 53 year old man:

Today I went swimming as I usually do.  There was a new fella' there, today.  About 30 years my junior.  He looked a bit out of shape, but good on him getting started!

During our warm ups, he swam as fast as he could.  Poor guy tired himself out and couldn't keep up the pace.  Like the hare who lost to the tortoise.  After a few laps of lagging behind, he decided to put as much effort as he could muster into the last lap.  I guess he injured himself.

I hope he doesn't give up on swimming.  I hope he learns that it doesn't matter how fast we go.  We are all just trying to get to the same place, and there is no prize for getting there first."
“Displaying his puppet hole” cracks me up hahaha
"Keep reapplying. If possible, look for work that you can do from home, or that allows for telecommuting. Above all, *keep your positivity.* You seem like a practical, good-hearted person. Keep a tight hold on that and forge on. You're going to have a hard time of it, but with the grit and family support I've seen in your post I'm certain you can get through this. If you need a friendly ear, please feel free to DM me."
"But see, they live in a shelter so they have no bills so they can just blow all their money when they get it! /s  

Look, OP, I get it, poverty is a difficult cycle to break, but buying stupid shit like recreational drugs while taking up space in a shelter is actually a slap in the face to the shelter and those who are genuinely trying to get back on their feet and would do anything to have the opportunity you have of a free place to stay while also having a job. Grow the fuck up and save a few checks and once you can pay for necessities like food then maybe you can get high once in awhile."
"""Who found him?""

Yeah guys so I have some weird condition where I have to inject insulin a couple times a day, but yeah anyway I figured I'd participate in no insulin November, just a on whim you know?

"If she broke up with him over this, than I think it's really for the best. Yeah he may have hurt her feelings, but it could've been far worse than what is mostly a harmless joke.

If she couldn't stand it to the point of leaving then really the relationship was rocky from the start, I'd say.

edit: For the confused, I didn't say that either was more at fault than the other. Just that the relationship probably wasn't the best for both of them."

Dog is told they're an okay boy and that they'll probably never get another piece of bacon ever again.
"Once freaked out because my dog was acting out of sorts. Staring at nothing, wobbly on his legs... all in all definitely not himself. He's a pug and we feared it was pug encephalitis or something else serious. Take him to the Vet ER (at 9 pm on a week day). Pay $500 + for the vet to tell us that he probably ate some weed and was just really high. This whole time we thought that he was for sure a goner and he was just high as a kite. 

We were told to just wait it out. He's fine now :) 

Your dog will be totally fine as far as the weed goes, if the cookies had chocolate in them then that may give him a little bit of trouble but nothing lethal. 

Edit: Chocolate is bad for your dogs and can be lethal and I was half asleep when I wrote this. Yes, I know chocolate is bad for dogs. I promise, I do. "

"I have a bottle of The Source in my pantry. It's no fucking joke. The tiny glob of foul concentrate you had is enough to turn a gallon of chili into a complete nightmare. Consider that Police pepper spray typically falls somewhere between 2MM and 5.5MM Scoville units, AKA nightmarishly hot. Diabolically hot. Fuck me gently with a chainsaw hot. I've done the toothpick thing with The Source twice and both times it was beyond intense. It's like doing LSD for your mouth but it's always a bad trip. Like your experience it lasts like half an hour and it just keeps getting more intense as time passes. I was showing the bottle to a friend once and he opened it and got a tiny microdot  of it on his shirt and before I could stop him he had licked it off. He spent the next half hour unable to speak as he was doubled over with drool pouring out of his mouth like it was an open faucet. Good times.

This sums up my reaction. This is one of the more “*interesting*” TIFU I’ve ever seen. 
"PROTIP: Extract-based sauces like Da Bomb are meant to be additives for large-batch cooking, not directly applied to food. Due to the extraction process, they taste acrid, bitter, and metallic, immediately overpowering your senses. Perceived heat is MUCH higher with extracts. Check the ingredients before buying/consuming.

Natural pepper-based blends will be much more flavorful and complex with more tolerable heat, even if the scoville rating is higher. Many people can enjoy 500k+ scoville rated sauces just fine but a dash of 100k extract will ruin their meal.

Also, if you need relief, citric acid is #1. It will neutralize capsaicin's alkalinity immediately. The fats and oils in dairy like milk or ice cream are your next best option. If you plan on doing some kind of extreme sauce challenge, don't do it on an empty stomach."
"I feel kinda sorry after reading this. 

Though I want to tell you...sex is not always super hot, sexy, mind blowing and satisfying as hell. Sometimes it's awkward, wrong or strange at least. Sometimes 2 people just lack physical chemistry and you don't know or don't want to believe beforehand. I think most of us have been at this point for at least one time in their lives (I was there a lot).

So please try not to overrate this. I would also guess that the majority of first experiences was rather on the negative site of things.

&amp;#x200B;

Try to move on and forget about it. Good luck for the next try."

If this it was cause their breakup they were doomed long before this. This is nothing and any strong relationship would easily survive this.

"Idk when I had pot brownies and put on pink floyd, I played this song called ""echoes"" and had the worst 'bad trip' in my entire life. "
"Once my roommate made pot brownies.  Didn't tell me.  And not cheep ones - 80% caccao Ghiradelli pot brownies.  My Dog ate the whole thing.  All of it.  He was, thankfully, a huge fucking dog.  Took him two days to recover, and he shit everywhere.  Dogs can survive both pot and chocolate, but it's not a funny fucking joke."
"Look at the bright side, though. How often does a Red Sox fan literally get to shit on a Yankees fan?"
"Sooo... she set up a date on Remembrance Day and waited to go 'see her dad' until after the date was supposed to start and she'd already made you lose the reservation?

None of this adds up.

If this was a recent passing, there's no way she would have arranged a date on the same day she would be lost in grief. And why wouldn't she have seen him earlier in the day? Dinner time is a weird hour to decide to visit the cemetary

It almost sounds like a set up. Like she wanted to 'test' your comforting abilities in the most psychotic way ever. 

You didnt fuck up man, she sounds fucked up."

"One of my friends had twin that died when he was 8 or 9, I met him when he was a senior in high school. So I go over to his house with a couple buddies and we are sitting there playing four player Smash Brothers. He turns to me and says hey do you want to meet my brother. He then proceeds to point at the Box of his brother's ashes sitting on top of the speaker on the entertainment center and say he's right there. Needless to say we all have some pretty demented humor"

To be fair, I am 45 and had Lucky Charms for supper, so I need adult supervision as well."
"So, walked in on my husband watching porn. He was really embarrassed and I was like ""uh, I know you watch porn. Why are you embarassed.""

Everyone in the other room knows you watch porn. Kind of surprising you would rub one out with that many people over rather than being social, but it's all good. I doubt anyone cares. If they're merciless they'll make fun of you. If they're kind they will pretend like it never happened. Also, depending on noise level they may not have heard it.

Also, unlikely you destroyed your hard drive, especially if it was SSD. Your files should be fine."

"Not to hate on anything, but checked op’s posts.
He wants to pursue full time streaming, leaving his parents cause they’re angry he wants to put his studies on hold for it.

From the other sub he posted in, r/leagueoflegends , i found his username and figured out his peak rank is pretty average  (gold 4, top 25% of all ranked players) with quite a few games(120 this year). It’s not stated that this is the game he wanted to stream, but it’s possible.

All by all, i sincerely wish him the best of luck with streaming if he ever starts, but those aspirations + the MTG thot situation is a red flag for at least some girls."

"was about to post the same. I'm not oppposed to marihuana use in general, but your priorities are really off. You buy weed rather than food after not eating for 16 hours? Were you planning on starving high? Please consider not getting high until you have a stable job, a place to live and, first and foremost, *enough fucking food.*  
I'm worried mate. Wishing you the best!"
I laughed my ass off. That sucks. Grandma sounds like a nutcase though and needs to lighten up. Cheers

"Thing is, you found a girl who actually goes with you to support your hobbies.  People telling you to break up with her because she got offended at you humiliating her in public are nuts and most likely are single themselves.   
My boyfriend has been getting me into D&amp;D and Pathfinder.  For someone new to it, it can be overwhelming and being in a setting where you're out of your element can be a bit stressful for some.    
If he were to loudly say something like this to me, in public, full of people I don't know, in a place I'm unfamiliar with... yeah, I'd be pissed to.  
I have a pretty big sense of humor and I can say that I would have laughed if my boyfriend had made this joke on me in a setting with a bunch of friends.       
Time and place is everything.    


I agree with you apologizing and doing a little something extra nice for her, like a back rub or taking her out to dinner or even just telling her why you care about her.  "

Broke for three days and haven't eaten, live in a shelter. After getting a check, first thing you think is fuck it, cigs, weed, and a movie. These are the basic human necessities right?

""Lady thinks im being an asshole"" is because you are being an asshole. And then your first idea is to post on reddit? With all the things you bought it sounds like you probably blew most of your paycheck in less than a day. Your priorities are so far out of whack it's insane. This isn't a ""today I fucked up"", this is a ""today I realised that at some point I colossally fucked up my life"". Get your shit together, get sober, and get a stable life. Stop wasting other peoples money living in a shelter meant for people that have fallen on hard times, not for people that need a place to crash after blowing their money on drugs and failing to contribute anything to society.

I've more or less given up.

I'm almost 33 now, been on less than 5 dates, dont know how how to flirt or strike up a convo, never kissed a guy let alone slept with one.

Starting now seems intimidating, daunting, embarrassing and impossible. 

Online dating is ridiculous but frankly I don't know how to chat or flirt with men. Same for speed dating.

Doing social activities and meeting new people was just as useless because guys were uninterested or mostly already taken.

I refuse to go out with a coworker or get matched with someone through a friend. I'm so paranoid about things going south because they will and then everyone will know the details.

Edit 2: Everytime I discuss this on reddit, there are always amazingly supportive people commenting and messaging me. Just wanted to note thanks and that I will reply, when work gives me the chance. "
"She's mad at *everyone.* Wouldn't you be?

She's coming home early when she's supposed to be doing trial prep because of this mess.

To be fair, I understand why she's furious.

Yes, we'll be having a serious conversation about her mother.  She's been showing signs of dementia.  I think we've passed ""signs."""
Reasonable? He lives in a shelter and his first action after getting money is buying weed...
For what its worth you can probably recover the data on the harddrive. I'm more than happy to help you do so if the data on the drive is important enough to warrant such measures. Also......yea shit happens bro. Also remember EVERY last one of those people have masturbated before and looked at porn. 
This is wholesome as fuck. 
"About 20 years ago, I was out in the wilderness fishing with family, and we were staying in a cabin with no power. Long story short, there was a bear who kept smashing the wood around a padlock, and breaking into the cabin to get into a propane fridge and a cooler that we kept our food in. (This was before “Yeti” coolers.) Anyway, he fucked up the cabin about 4 times, and since we were afraid that he may break in while we were sleeping and fuck us up too, we decided to throw some hot sauce that we found in a cupboard, onto some cut up cantaloupe, and leave it in the cooler. As expected, the bear broke in again while we were out fishing, ate the cantaloupe, and got a mouthful of the hot sauce. The poor thing was out in the woods groaning for an hour, making sad “what the fuck is this fire in my mouth” noises. We felt terrible. When we put the sauce on the cantaloupe, we figured it was like tabasco sauce, but it turns out that it was one of the insanely hot brands sold as a novelty item way back then, complete with a health warning on the back. We didn’t read the back until after hearing his cries of agony, and piecing it together that this was hotter than normal hot sauce. This revelation made us feel even worse about it. Anyway, he didn’t come back again! "
What did you see
I’d never allow her back in my home if she pulled a gun on me or had a gun near my children. 
"By ""I occasionally post pictures on Reddit,"" he apparently means ""every single post I've ever made is a close-up photo of my monster dong.""

In fairness to op, he does indeed have a monster dong."
"Hey, look at it this way, you gave your buddy an afternoon he's pretty much never going to forget. Definitely shook up his day, and when you're depressed, that's often a good thing."
Get him a chalupa and a Mountain Dew and he will be just fine. 
"All my life i felt like an odd duck, today, i feel normal, thanks stranger."
*ISIS already knows*
"He’s not exactly an understanding guy, took a long time for him to get over it "

It was uncalled for and stupid, but it was also a stupid joke. If someone can't take that, then splitting up was coming sooner or later anyways."
What is a bad trip like for a dog?
This sounds like it's straight out of a movie where the main character has a huge fuck-up and has to reevaluate his entire life. 
"Ahh, stress dreams! Aren't they the best?

I once had one where I was walking down a back alley and suddenly got attacked by oversized rats. (Not like the R.O.U.S.es in The Princess Bride. They were normal-looking rats, but about the size of a cocker spaniel.) As I was fighting them off, one of them stood on its hind legs, grabbed onto my thigh, and wouldn't let go - so I pulled my other leg back and kicked it as hard as I could. The rat said ""OW!"" in my then-boyfriend's voice, then ""What the hell did you do that for?"" which woke me up enough to realize that I'd actually kicked him. I gave the obvious response - ""Sorry, I thought you were a giant rat"" - then rolled over and went back to sleep."
"I initially read this as ""this sums up my erection.""

Mine too.

What comes up must cum down.
"I remember bringing a laser pointer from the dollar store into my elementary school. I kept it hidden away but took it out at recess to show some of  the other kids. It was great fun, they chased it around like cats and everything! 
Someone told my teacher that I had this dinky little red laser and she had a private meeting with me and the principal where they berated me, told me that my dad must work for the military and that I stole this from him when he wasn't looking because there is no way I could get my hands on such dangerous military equipment. Then there was a phone call and I was sent home for the day..
I don't remember much but the OP just reminded me of this."
Was it a monster dong tho?
Not anymore
Because poking holes in cannisters that you think contain compressed gas is a good idea. Man that teacher was dumb
grapes
"Not even that strong, this was clearly a joke."
Tbh it kinda sounds like OP made this entire story up while high.
This is why companies have HR departments
The visual of you staring your father right in the eye while jamming a whole roll in your mouth definitely reminds me of my own family. 
Trying to get people to poop in bleach with this BS story?
"The way it was described to me: you should answer each question as you would on your *worst* day. Not ""sometimes I can work and I'm fine!"" But answer ""my worst days incapacitate me completely."""

"So I am generously endowed, ➕ have a ❗️ 👍️ relationship with my 🍆. 😂. I occasionally 🏤 images on reddit ➕ other places, ➕ someone 🗣️❓️ 👤⬅️ if i could 🎭️ auto-fellatio. I hadn’t ever 💭 of it, so I 👤📖 some tips, ⌚️ some 🎬️s ➕ realized that because of my size ➕ my general skinny 🖼️, i have the ideal 👃 type for sucking my own D. How exciting 😂. So, there are a few different approaches, leaning ⏩️ or 🍗 over your 🗣️. I tried the leaning ⏩️ approach but had no 🤞 at all, so then i was like 🖕 it, got naked, layed ⬇️ near a wall, threw my 🍗 over my 🗣️, ➕ slowly “🚶 ⬇️ the wall” as the advice was. Holy 💩 i was close.

Yeah gross. But I don't think Mr Tape My Eye Shut cares for your fancy napkin.

"Nurse: 
- do you have any allergies ?

OP: 
- yes. My eyes are allergic to spider guts 

Nurse:

"I was anticipating reading about you rubbing a spiders egg into your eye and it hatching inside your eye but we don't need to IMMEDIATELY jump to the worst possible situation, now do we."
"Correct, i dont suck my own cock but i do have some wierd stories , nothing beat this one tough, still... 
  When i was a child i loved taking shits , i spent an hour pressing the toilet paper with my finger against the walls of my asshole because it would make me shit even more, i loved it, i wasted to much toilet paler tough and my grandparents used to scream at me a lot because of it, they would usualy say something along the line ""JESUS CHRIST STOP WASTING SO MUCH TOILET , ALL I NEED IS 2 WIPES AND I AM DONE, HOW THE FUCK DO YOU WAST ALMOST A ROLE EVRERY TIME?"". Flashforward a few weeks
    I am finishing taking a shower , and i have been using much less toiltet paper then ever before, it wasnt even clean on the last wipe but well, i had enouth complaining from my grandpa, so i use the towel to dry my asshole and shit comes out enroled in pubs and cotton because i didnt wipe well enough , it must have formed into a crust and the hot water must have moisturized it and it came out, no surprise there, but the shit stain from the towel doesnt come out... 
   And then i notice , every single towel has shits stains all over .. every single one of them... They arent black spots from drying in the sun... They are shit stains ...and then it hits me, my grandparents ... It`s their shit stains, and the best part, they sometimes use the small towels when we are out of the big ones, the towels we use to wipe our faces and hands and they have shit stains to. I have been rubbing my face in their assholes all this time. My friends call me Turdy."
Be more respectful to your S.O.B 😂
"Just say “Yer okay, Boah” and it counts as honorable. "
"Excellent, this will prove valuable to my scientific research.

"I did this exact same thing when I was 21/22, i was at the gym on a treadmill. A guy in his 50s was sprinting on another treadmill across from me. I increased my speed and looked at him smugly, he then proceeded to increase his incline. Being moderately fit at the time I did the same we ran like this for 20 more minutes. I got light headed and tripped over my feet and ended up on the floor... good times."
that's one way of motivating someone to do yoga.
we must go to different hospitals. i went in to get my jewels ultrasounded once and it was just one attractive woman. it got awkward after i started talking about the weather to distract myself.
"If you would have followed the directions, it probably wouldn't have worked. I read an article back then about the show's physics advisor. He always left out a crucial ingredient so kids couldn't actually hurt themselves trying it on their own."
"This.  

There was a loaded gun somewhere in your house where it could be accessed within seconds.  She disregarded your explicit instructions and put your children in danger.  Don't downplay that aspect.   "
Welcome to America! You get a gun! You get a gun! *Everyone* gets a gun!
"Sex is almost always awkward 😅

The trick is to not buy into the fantasy of porno and be totally cool with the awkwardness. You're both naked and doing a physical activity to cum. You look awkward, you're both sweaty, you're both grunting and moaning like animals. It's an awkward workout that feels great and ends in orgasm. That's basically what it boils down to so don't make it more awkward by being awkward about the awkwardness. Embrace it. Laugh at it if you have to.

Edit: I'm referring mostly to a fearful virgin and their outlook on their first time. Apparently that wasn't clear in a thread about a 26yo virgin using an escort to remove a perceived shame. 
 I know you're all hard-dick warrior studs that slay to oblivion but most virgins have a fear of sex due to an unrealistic and dishonest sense of what it is. Hence, awkwardness. Surely YOU never felt it but some did 😅
 I hope this edit helped."
waiting for a full recovery 
One day I will learn my lesson on viewing reddit profiles in public.
"As a woman I agree. 
A.) why are you calling her a name in public anyways? Even jokingly... Be more respectful to your SO. 
B.) start apologizing and bring her her favorite snack or make dinner and clean the bathroom if you haven’t already. "
I feel bad for the kids that witnessed that. There is literally a gun pulled out. Someone could have *died*. The amount of trauma those kids would have experienced that day. Ooof. 
"Your eyes are actually really, really good at healing themselves. Like wolverine level healing powers.

I once got a burning piece of ember in my eye. A co-worker put her cigarette out on a windy day, and a lit piece ended up right in my eye. I walked the 40 feet to the ER (I worked at a hospital at the time) and the ER doc told me to just keep my eye shut for a couple hours, and explained the eyes superhuman healing capabilities. He taped it shut and I went back to work. Two hours later, I took the patch off and was fine. "
This is the best thing I’ve read all day. The simplicity of your TLDR was truly the icing on the cake.

Your MIL is batshit insane.... seriously.... who the fuck points a gun at the son in law for an obvious misinterpretation and oversight....
I legit did the same thing and had the same reaction lmaoo

The unluckier version got spider eggs incubating in his eyes.
But did they discharge you?
"A guy at work injured his back. Gone for two months. After coming back he still had problems with sitting down, he did it slowly supporting himself on the table. During next two months he passed out twice. An ambulance was called etc. We think he is overdosing painkillers. After the second passing out, that happened several weeks ago, he never came back to work. So it seems he is still in bad shape. A 40-ish years old guy. His health probably ruined for the rest of his life.

Better find someone who does good long blowjobs and enjoys it. There will be two happy people instead of a single disabled one.

edit: after some back injuries you never fully recover."
FBI and CIA would like in on the info.
"Generally speaking...yes.  From the hands point of view.  
Plus there is a ton of nerve endings in the mouth.  Lots more than the hand, so you get a lot more sensory feedback from...why the fuck am I replying to this?"
"Seriously, I knew this was going to be bad when “living in a shelter”, “bought a half of weed”, and “went to see a movie” were in the same post"

"This sounds a lot like my 6th grade social studies fair project on the unabomber. My parents actually did help me a lot, probabaly too much. We (mostly my dad) made a pipe bomb replica for my display and it looked very real, so we put a note on it saying it was not a real bomb. This did not convince school officials who asked me to show them that it was not a real bomb by taking it apart. In retrospect, I do not know why my parents hought this was a good idea. I think they just wanted me to turn in a project to not look like a failure."
Okay...can...can we go back to talking about autofellatio?   Is that still on the table?
"Yeah I think I'll still be single for a while if my opener is Hi, is your dad dead 😂😂 "
"I’m so confused as your measurements, how much is ‘half of weed’ and I have no idea what kind of movie theaters you are going to that it’s $24 dollars when I see movies all the time in Manhattan for $14 "
"I think it depends on his and her reaction though. If she clearly expressed humiliation and he just ignored it and highfived the other dudes than it would probably show a pattern of shittery from him. My guess is the dude is missing a lot of details. If he noticed her being uncomfortable any normal guy would've exclaimed ""just kidding my {pet name here}! You know you're amazing!"". Or any other act of making sure she knew it was a joke right at the spot and the joke wasn't her but the phrasing."
"Everyone I know with disability says the fight to get it was years in the making and they had to re-apply a stupid number of times. It sounds shitty, keep at it though.
