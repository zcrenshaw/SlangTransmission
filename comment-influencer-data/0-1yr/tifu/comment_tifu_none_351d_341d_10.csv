"So.. let me just get this straight. You lie about where you are from. Then you are introduced to somebody that is from there, and you decide to just double down on the lie and hope that you somehow can convince him? "
Damn! You probably could have went and bought all new clothes for the amount they charge.!

"I’d like to hear the outcome, please post an update!"
This honestly deserves more upvotes. This is so fucking funny. Instead of just quickly and quietly telling his friend you’re not actually from Estonia you *actually* spoke gibberish to him. In real life. You actually fucking did that. Amazing.
The line about the people behind you knowing more about your body than you killed me.  Bravo.
"Ugh...this is one of those things you lay awake at night years from now cringing at.

Personally if I were in your shoes I'd call or text the family and apologize and explain. That's just me though. Not everyone can do this."
Even though it was difficult you should contact the hotel management and give her a positive review. A little positive reinforcement goes a long way for the next time she has to deal with a problem!
I was so sure that this tale would involve prostitution...
"My friend committed suicide by sitting on the railroad tracks and facing the train head on. 

On his funeral they played one of his favorite songs which was like a western type song with train whistles and all that through it. He would've laughed, so I did as well.  "

"Do you live on a public street? My friends HOA is trying to regulate the street and turns out they have no jurisdiction.

From what I was told by our local city that unless the HOA has made it a private drive and is paying for maintenance that they can not regulate who parks on the streets.

Another thing to look into(if they do in fact own the street) is if they are required to give a certain number warnings or notification before towing.

City Laws/State laws trump HOA ~~laws~~  Policy"
"He'll *definitely* remember, but he probably won't be certain after that time.

If he is, u/darth_scion will have time to establish a work relationship and can call out the boss for being a shit driver.

""Oh, yeah, when you almost ran me over?  Yup, that was me you almost killed."""
And my wardrobe is cheap as hell!! For real. I shop at goodwill and second hand clothes stores. No doubt I could’ve gotten a way better wardrobe upgrade with what they charged.

"Boy, he took you to the cleaners, eh?  "
I mean that’s better than nothing but sucks ass still
"I have to say, every hotel I’ve ever stayed at had an itemised list with prices next to it. I think if you mention this and demonstrate that you think it’s unprofessional you were not told upfront about charges (considering you are a loyal customer with a lot of points) you could sort this out fairly quickly. "
"One time I got a summons for jury duty on my birthday. I decided that if I had to go to jury duty on my birthday, I was going to have some fun with it. So I dressed up in full Scottish regalia, kilt, hose, vest and tie, the whole thing. They only thing I didn't have was the fly plaid and sgian dubh, since A. I didn't have one, and B. No knives in court.

So I show up and sit in the bench with a book, some people giving me weird looks, but I didn't care, just waiting for everything to start. The judge eventually comes in and starts talking with other court employees while I'm reading. I'm distracted from my book reading however when the bailiff comes over to me and says,

""The judge would like for you to approach the bench.""

I dog ear my page and squeeze out of the pew and head up to the judge. He's smiling and asks me essentially why I'm dressed the way I am. I tell him that this is formal Scottish attire, today is my birthday, and this is how I dress on my birthday (which isn't a lie, I do dress up on my birthday, but usually only for dinner). We then spend the next 15 minutes or so talking about history. He compliments my outfit, tells me that he's Polish, and explains that he feels a kinship to the Scottish, since both the Scots and the Poles were cultures that were nearly destroyed by outsiders. When were done he then asks me to stand there while he addressed the court. He then told everybody there that it was my birthday, told them about my outfit, and asked that anyone who would like to do so wish me a happy birthday, which several of them did later.

He was very nice, and dismissed us all shortly afterward since his docket had been cleared before we had arrived that morning (except one, who elected to have a trial by judge, so none of us were needed). He then told the court that before we left, he would like for us to line up so he could personally thank all of us for coming, since jury duty is an important part of the legal system. I waited around and got a picture with him afterwards. All in all, it was a pretty good day.

Edit: Holy shit! My first gold dubloon! Thank you kind stranger for the gold, and all the positive reactions to my story!"
"HOAs are complete bull shit. It’s like an elevated neighborhood watch. The only good I can see from them is keeping your neighbors from doing crazy shit to bring the value of your house down.

Other than that, they’re literally like the neighborhood watch from Hot Fuzz. It’s all about the greater good."
Foolproof.
"Chemist here. I want to add one additional thing because I see it all the time. Simple dust masks or t-shirts will not help block VOCs, (volatile organic compounds) from entering your lungs. You need to use a respirator with a proper cartridge for the type of chemicals that you will be using."
Thanks for the cautionary tale.

It should also come off when you're in churches, fancy restaurants, and theatres."
"Dispute it completely.   Whenever I've had laundry done at a hotel, there's always an itemized form you have to fill out, sign and put in the bag, where the cost of everything is listed.

If you handed the guy a bag of clothes there's no itemization and zero confirmation from you regarding cost.

If you let her keep thinking you're gonna propose then she's gonna be let down when you don't. Tell her now so that she doesn't have her hopes up until your trip and then is surprised to get the laptop rather than a ring"
"Ugh. Subletted a condo with an HOA. The most miserable 6 months of my life.

They were SUPER strict about ""vehicle maintenance.""  Had run-ins with them on two occasions, both at 6am when leaving for work.  

One morning I had a dead battery when leaving for work, so I pulled the girlfriend's car around, popped the hoods, and jumpstarted my car. That evening I was met by the head busybody showing me photos that someone sent him of this horrid violation.  I asked what I should have done for the future. According to the rules, I was expected to call an authorized towtruck and have my vehicle towed to a service station to be properly repaired.   

Right.

The second one was similar. Was getting ready to leave and saw I had a flat tire. No worries, 10 minutes with the jack and the donut was installed. AGAIN I was approached saying that I was in violation. I explained that I was fully capable of changing this tire. He said that's fine and it was my legal right to change my own tire, but I was expected to hire the towtruck and have the vehicle towed off the property, and then I could change the tire in the street out of the subdivision.

Apparently the residents would rather have a large flatbed truck with flashing beacon lights spinning around backing up down a 1/4 mile long driveway going BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP at 6AM rather than experience the absolute white trash horror of a car with its hood open for five minutes. "

"It’s been a few months since this happened, but I work at a hospital. Coworker listens to a classics hit channel a lot at work so naturally they get stuck in my head.

"OP this is worth a read as it pertains to California. Sounds like what they did is in fact illegal regardless of the HOA contract. In short they have to provide warnings before towing you.

"You just really wanted to type ball-cock 5 times without being heckled, didn’t ya? "
"Personally I would go higher up the chain and again explain the situation. Stating you never recieved any sort of pricing, and never even signed for it. Also, that had you not had the state of mind to follow up, you would have been blind sided upon check out. Adding in that $300 for a few garments is a lot of money and the front desk should have known the cost, and itterated it to you and gotten approval before sending it, affording you the option of, well, not doing it. "
"Is it an online submission thing where she can only see the correct cover letter now? If all she can see is that you changed it, you should be fine. If she asks why it was changed just tell her you uploaded the wrong file and leave it at that.

If she actually got a chance to read the Hitler story, then you might have some problems, but you can salvage it. Just let her know what happened and explain fully. Tell her exactly what you wrote here. Let her know you made a mistake by uploading the wrong file, that what you sent was a story for a creative writing class, and that it does not express your views on the subject. Chances are she'll be cool about it."
The people behind didn't see half of what the poor judge probably did. He could probably tell what religion OP was as he approached the bench.
Haha that's hilarious. 
Here's a super cheap option for you: get a high vis vest and wear it over your bike gear. Technically makes you safer AND it's very distinct so if he sees you in it a few times he'll never suspect. 
"Woah, that’s giving me a little too much... credit."
The winter season is coming so my riding days were limited anyhow. Hopefully he forgets by spring lol
I'm considering still looking into it and calling around to see if there's anything else I can do. The fact that I filled out no forms is what I'm leaning into. I don't think the front desk manager likes me.......
"I would reply back and thank them for the 50% but mention that unfortunately that isn’t a satisfactory solution since you didn’t agree to any amount nor was one mentioned to you. 

I would NOT settle with a $150 bill. "
"At first I was wondering why the heck anyone would name their dog fuck face but
&gt; A half an hour passes and still no fuck face. I start to panic, I roll down my windows  and began to yell FUCK FACE as loud as I possibly could. 

It’s a hilarious name. I’m glad you got him back. "
I really really hope so. I’m starting to see that I should’ve filled something out before hand? But I didn’t. I’ll definitely mention this. 
"Didn’t you have to fill out a form of exactly how many garments you’re sending out? That form typically has pricing next to each line item. If they use a third party vendor for laundry chances of getting your money back are slim if it is done in-house, you’ll have a better chance. I wouldn’t mention the HH points if I were you..it doesn’t help at all, most people that travel for work know hotel laundry isn’t free( I’m sorry if this sounds rude but i work in hotels so I know this won’t help your argument) "
"So I realized when I originally emailed her, I asked about the forms and all that and how I never filled one out.  She completely ignored that part of my email. I’m thinking I should respond and push that matter and ask why I wasn’t given one and was that their normal process? Bad idea?"
"Yeah, mine is trying to do that now. Our road is a public road and I'm fairly certain they have no jurisdiction on the road itself. Anyone know how this works out. Specifically, we live in Alabama."
"Even something a little generic like "" She was really willing to work with me"" would make a huge difference in the world for that manager, most likely."
The irony here is the TIFU sorry involves weed but the fuck up actually happened while of sound mind. 
"As someone who worked customer service, they’ll definitely knock it down further. The trick is to keep going up the ladder. 
Ask for the manager’s superior, whoever it may be, and keep explaining the situation to whomever you get. 

It’s a pain for sure, but you eventually get someone so high up that the amount is trivial and they don’t want you as a headache. "
I used to work at a Hilton. Insane that they wouldn't disclose the price before hand. I would've been scalped had I done that to a guest

So you're the guy who knocked my mirror off?  Come see me in my office.

"Listen, three things: 1.) I travel for work too, and our corporate travel policy states that laundry costs are paid after a six day trip. I don’t know what kind of work you do, but that’s pretty common, especially for a bigger company. 2.) You mentioned you have a lot of Hilton points; so do I. You didn’t mention your specific status that I saw. I’m a Diamond member, but I hardly ever mention it unless there’s an issue, and then I throw that shit around like it’s confetti. Stay calm, but just keep saying, “I’m a Diamond member. We book through BCD Travel (or whatever your travel company is, if there is one). I don’t mind paying a reasonable rate for my laundry, but $300 for a bag of workout clothes is ridiculous. I’ve had laundry done before, they gave me a slip with prices, and I signed it. I never signed a slip here.” (Don’t say you’ve never had laundry done before.) “i’ve been staying in Hilton hotels for X number of years, and I really don’t want to change hotel chains for something so silly.” 3.) I also saw someone mention up a thread to tweet directly at Hilton. That’s a great suggestion. I’m platinum with Delta, and while  I’ve never had a problem getting my own issues taken care of, I got a friend’s problem fixed by tweeting at Delta, between the time her flight took off, and the time it landed.

Don’t trade in your points. I’ve worked in hotels for years before I changed professions. Their job is to please and always have the best reviews possible. Polity talk to the GM and let him know you’re a loyal member and are in no position to pay that astronomical amount of money. Be stern. Don’t take no for an answer. Let them know that it was THEIR staff that didn’t inform you of cost or have you fill out a receipt. Be persistent in telling the (nicely) that this is bad communication on their behalf. It’s should be comped or at least dramatically discounted.

"100%. She needs to look at this as a first offer. At no point was she told the cost of the service. She did not agree to pay even $150. Frankly, I'd refuse to pay any of it on the basis that it was implied to be a complementary service, but I'm a little ornary. But this hasn't cost the hotel anything, they're not out of pocket for any costs so not paying does nothing but put them back into the same position they would have been.

I'd also suggest that she will reconsider staying with Hilton in future if they do not. $150 vs probably thousands in income from future stays is an easy choice. "
"As a former instructor, I have a piece of advice for you:  You need to leave your temper at the garage door when you ride and ensure it stays there.  Two wrongs don't make a right and he undoubtedly didn't set off to make a mistake that day, just like you don't on the days you make a mistake. 

None of us are perfect, but when you ride around playing road vigilante, you just make people hate bikers more than they already do.  Life's too short: People trying to kill us is part of riding, you can't lose your shit every time someone doesn't see you."

"Understandable. However, I'd just put on some old clothes... Painting naked is a really dumb idea imho. :D"
"Don’t lie. Just tell the exact truth.

1. You have never used a hotel laundry service before and you’re shocked to discover it’s so expensive.
2. For *any* additional charge, but especially such an expensive one, you expect to be informed up front.

The mini bar has a price card. The pay-per-view movies have a price listed. The room service menu has prices. It is not unreasonable to assume anything that costs extra will be advertised accordingly. This isn’t on you - it’s on them. They failed to tell you the cost.

This is a negotiation. Don’t ask for a discount or offer to use your points as a starting position. Keep that up your sleeve. Start by asking that the full amount be waived on the basis that their employee failed to inform you of the cost. "

"Who the fuck wears a hat to a viewing, regardless of dress code? Take your hat off when it’s appropriate to."
"Yes. Explain that had you been presented with the costs prior to dropping your clothes off, you would have reevaluated the amount. Because you never signed off on them charging you, plus you ran back to another employee astonished by it not being complimentary means you have a good argument. Don't bring up your points. Make sure they know that while you should have asked first, it is their responsibility to inform you of the cost beforehand. Otherwise they are trapping you rather than allowing you to decide. For a Hilton, that is quite scummy behavior. 

Just make sure to be rational through the whole thing. I've found that when working with any company to be reimbursed, it is very helpful to remain calm. They will do more for the calm person than the angry one. Save the anger for if they don't help lol."
"Well I certainly hope they make it up to her somehow. This sounds like a really shitty, underhanded way to make money off people. 

I bet they're either banking on the fact that most people wouldn't know to ask for a refund or would be too proud to ask for one. 

In what world does it cost $300 to do laundry? How is that cost even remotely justifiable? 

 
We really shouldn't allow corporations to fuck with us like this.  "
"She could have TRIPLED down on the lie. 

In fact, she should have accused his “Estonian” friend of not speaking Estonian. "
"I’ll look into it for next time. Hopefully not soon, eh? Thanks for the info."
"So I’d totally donate severals of dollars to a fundraiser for “Dude’s broken Ball-Cock expense” or something similar, just to be able to share it."
"taking in a stray = good karma

giving stray a really fucked up name = bad karma

you are now karma neutral"
"If there was no sheet to sign with the costs outlined someone should be getting reprimanded. You can't just charge something to a guest at will without them signing it into their bill. 

Sounds like someone got lazy and OP should have that charge removes. This isn't hard to dispute. "
"That’s the tune we’re supposed to use for chest compressions in CPR lol 

Ironically, “Another One Bites The Dust” is also accurate. "
"I feel like the hotel has actually hurt themselves in this case as she can completely say items totalling × amount are unaccounted for and since she filled nothing out, how would they prove otherwise?

There wasn't proper protocol. "
In her Estonian? Easy: blablagrlahgrish 
I've passed on houses because they demanded HOA fees. There's some accuracy here. 
"As metal as it is, it's also horrible to the train driver and passengers aboard the train. In my country it's a relatively common method (10 percent of suicides) to kill oneself by train and train machinists very often have to get counseling as a result. Can you imagine seeing someone on the tracks a ways ahead of you, pulling the brakes but knowing the train will never stop on time? It causes a lot of chaos in the train system/timetables as well, people missing important flights/job interviews etc. But those who are in a state that drives them to commit suicide should not be expected to think of these effects, of course; it's tragic enough that they have reached that point and they don't commit suicide without reason.  "
"I mean he had to turn around to leave and waddle back out, im sure everyone in that court room saw plenty of all angles of this man lol"
But what about the students enrolled in your class? OP you're the teacher now and you have a responsibility to teach your students. 
"I am trying to add a parking pad to my driveway and a walkway and patio under my porch and the HOA denied it, want me to meet with the modification architect, but wont provide the reasons they denied the modifications.  This is after I was victim of tort behavior and libel, from the HOA. I am considering legal action.

Despise HOAs. Would eliminate them worldwide if I could."
The few times I’ve been to court I have been shocked that I was the only person wearing a tie.  Almost everyone is wearing pajamas or sweats
You think this would work? 
"I know someone who works in Hilton management... They do *not* fuck around with customer loyalty lol

A bad review from an upper echelon Hilton Rewards member gets corporate breathing down necks. They'll probably work with her however they can. "
you could have left it in your pocket and nothing would have happened
"No one at work will ever be like, ""That's your new bike? I feel like you've had it forever.""

And he will never think, ""Hey, you have the same commute schedule of the guy that punched the mirror off my Lexus and take the same road?""

I feel like, like this has a massively huge chance of blowing up completely.

Edit; Also, I'm sure there aren't any pictures, anywhere, circulating of you and your bike such as on social media?"
"It might've worked if South Estonia had their own regional dialect with completely different words, syntax and sounds that no North Estonian could possibly learn and understand in a lifetime.  Maybe South Estonia is full of bands of feral forest children forming their own tribal units, and inter-tribe communication is still heavily frowned upon, eliminating the need for a unifying language.

It's a gamble, but it's the one scenario where jibberish-talking just might work to score a second date."
Or at school. Now that would have been worse
"I don't think ""I didn't see you"" is a valid defense. When I got hit, the lady said she didn't see me. She ended up getting a careless driving ticket, which probably fucked her next time she needed to renew her insurance. "
The problem is that spray paint isnt usually used inside so the gases built up very quickly and displaced oxygen in your blood
"I used to be a hotel manager. The best course of action here is to not beat around the bush. You know what you want, so ask for it. If you truly won't be happy unless you get the whole bill comped, ask for that firmly but politely. If that manager will not agree to the compensation that will make you happy, ask for the General Manager. Again, be polite but firm with what will make you happy. If the managers are any good, they'll comp it. Don't make threats (bad reviews, escalations to corporate etc.) Those are courses of action you can take if you are not satisified, but will only serve to make the hotel managers be on the defensive, which you don't want. You want them on your side.

So just be upfront with what you want. Do not leave it up to the staff to guess at what you want. "
There was no inventory slip filled out? I’d just inquire about the $300 dress they “lost” with your laundry. Real shame it didn’t make it back with the rest of your stuff. 
"I don't know why so many people are recommending being shady. I work at a large, luxury Hilton property, and if someone came to us and explained that they made an honest mistake, I'd do what I could to help them out. Just be honest. It'll get you much further."
Technically an answer. 
"Even if I was well off, 300 dollars for a bag of laundry is an  absurd amount to charge for something that should have been under ten bucks! Talk about robbery, I'm in the wrong business. "
"Got it for a real bargain price, the guy had to get rid off it cos he got in shit with the cops cos he was punching mirrors off cars, what a dick.  "
