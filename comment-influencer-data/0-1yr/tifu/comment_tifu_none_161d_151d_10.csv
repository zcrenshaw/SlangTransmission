"Fucking ""toothpasting"" lmao"
You have probably ruined his passion for good audio
congrats on the sex
How would a random photo kiosk worker even tell the age of an asshole without any further context? Count the rings?
This must have happened to my tinder account
That fucking hurts my soul
"The photos told a story, it starts with my brother and gets deeper and deeper.... into his asshole."
"I feel you OP. I’m a heavy weight lifter and I was seeing this guy who didn’t believe I could deadlift 300lb and when we to the gym, I proved him wrong and he said something along the lines of ”I don’t think I can continue seeing you. It’s a turn off and totally not feminine”"
"&gt;	I looked at his dick and it wasn't there. I started feeling around in the sheets to see where this thing slipped to. Can't find it.

That’s a terrifying paragraph without some context."
what kind of girlfriend decides not to suck your dick due to a mild static shock?
"How did she even drop that on them? How do you squeeze that in a normal conversation? 

Me and Jeremy went to the mall the other day, he's was buying new undies because his boxers make it hard for me to sniff his ass dontcha know"

Your cousin finding this thread and making sneaky candid comments at the next family gathering - *priceless.*"
The lady next to you seemed to take it pretty well. I would be thankful enough at the fact she wasn't horrified lmao 
"It's got everything:

- sex    
- happy ending

"Uh, I would say that once your kid is of puberty age, you catch them masturbating, the best thing is to turn around and walk out."
male here. I had a vagina the entire time I read this story.
"Looking through your comments, some of them are long. It's so disheartening. 

I felt like I had to give some feedback to the BBC (hopefully in a constructive manner). Anyone else out there with 'diabulimia' either diagnosed or undiagnosed? Do you fit the current stereotype or not? Feel free to contact me to share experiences or just have someone to talk to.

&amp;#x200B;

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whilst its great that the BBC is raising awareness of Diabulemia with the JRDF I feel like you are unaware of how much you are advertising this as a 'young persons' thing. I'm a 34 year old dad of two working in a professional job and I was diagnosed with 'diabulemia' in 2018. It was an extremely difficult thing as an older man to admit I have this 'teenagers disease' as its always being advertised as such. If we could all remove the labels and typecasting people against ailments it would make it easier for others outside of that 'norm' to come forwards.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not alone in this. Its a hidden and shameful disease that causes quick death. Its a mix of mental and physical health completely invisible to the outside world. I'm getting help as I pushed for over a year when the systems and help in place didn't know what to do with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

My plea is that you keep covering this important topic but you are careful not to alienate any 'group'. The fact is there are type 1 diabetics of all ages and strategically missing insulin and being on the edge of DKA makes you lose weight quickly, for anyone that has an image or weight problem its 'the magic pill' and they may take the risk. Sometimes it pays off, sometimes they get it wrong and die. It could be Bettie at 68 that loves cream cakes, it could be Andy at 34 who was also Obese and now has a chance to look normal, it could be Zohra who took it to the extreme and became emaciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for all that you do. My family love newsbeat (my kids get to listen to it in class as a treat). Keep up the good work"
I feel like Tom Hanks right now
"Before anyone asks why not just explain to him what's up instead of going through all this effort to dodge/ghost.

Don't forget, OP doesn't want *anyone* in the family to know he's bi.  Even though the cousin would be cool with it (most likely, some gay people are weird about that), it would still present another source for the information to accidentally get out."
i think your wife may have a serious lack of judgment..
He’ll never be able to kiss his daughter on her face again. 
"Holy shit, that's brutal. We can see ya now, man."
"My dad did this to me tooo!! It was back when i was like 15 tho and my mom had gone on a trip. I had a very heavy period and only realized after sitting on the toilet that we had no pads at home. So I called my dad and asked him to buy me the big nighttime pads, the biggest ones and he comes back with a giant bag of adult diapers. Literally the biggest bag ever!! Lmao I mean it makes for a funny story and I really appreciate that he tried but I had to wear that shit for months cause I felt bad throwing it away. "
"Dont be sad, I've got enough mental fortitude to make it through. I've already blocked out my year of darkness, depression  and darkness. Did I mention darkness?"

That simultaneously made my sphincter pucker up and my ear start itching at the same time
The feeling when you get cock blocked by your own cock.
7/8 year olds must like taking pictures of buttholes because when my daughter was 8 she took a picture of our dogs butthole and would send it to random people in the phone she got a hold of

"You could still just say, hey dude, something came up and I can’t meet."
"&gt;she is planning on starting over with the guy she had an affair with

When practicing family law you hear about a lot of bad choices but the “I’m gonna start a new life with my paramour” plan is probably one of the top bad choices you can make. Having both persons in the affair wanting to do that is just bonkers, especially since they have kids.  Beside the fact that they’ll probably both get smacked in a custody battle, they can guarantee their kids are going to despise the couple  for forcing them to spend time with the person that ruined their family unit. Also they’ll never ever ever ever ever ever ever be able to have family time with their kids other parents. The whole “how’s it going? I’m really loving fucking your ex and raising your kids these days” dynamic don’t make for good times. Trying crack is more likely to work out than that plan"
At least she enjoyed it. :/

"Dont feel bad, I traumatized mine before she even got hers. I actually tried to post it here more then a year ago and it was removed for some stupid reason. 

TLDR is, we were watching a horror movie about possession and there was a young girl possessed by a demon. In the one scene they showed the girl tied to the bed with blood on her nightgown around that lower part. My daughter asks why she is bleeding. I immediately react and tell her ""oh that will happen to you one day"". My daughter instantly starts screaming and crying. Thankfully my fiance was there to call me an idoit and calm my daughter down. Apparently my daughter thought I meant, she be possessed one day. So I said ""no you wont be possessed you'll just bleed"" to which she started to scream and cry louder and I was yelled at to shut up by my fiance since I wasnt helping."
I really didn't need that mental image. 
Okay this one by far was the funniest.

"So something very similar happened to me in college and I can back you up, that it’s the worst thing that ever happened to me. 

I was sitting at my favorite spot near the lake on campus, just relaxing and enjoying the nice day, when I feel something fly into my ear. Like you, I immediately and violently freaked out. I could hear it buzzing and feel it moving and I’m just sobbing. I collect myself enough to take the bus to the infirmary on campus. Just silent tears streaming down my face the entire bus ride with some random twitches as the best moves inside my head. Other students are avoiding me, probably thinking I’m having a mental breakdown or on drugs. 

Once at the infirmary, they flush my ear and drown the creature. From within my head, I hear a high pitched shriek. Literally it had a death scream. I could’ve gone my whole life without hearing an insect death scream, but I guess we all have our crosses to carry. It turned out to be one of those flying ants. I’m still traumatized and I hear the scream in my nightmares."

"This is very true and important. I was in the same high school graduating class as the girl I'm seeing currently. We met up a few times and she asked me to pick her up, as she couldn't drive. When I got there and we began talking, she apologized once again and explained she had epilepsy and that was why she isn't allowed to drive.

I was surprised and said I never knew she had it, despite going to high school together. She replied that she didn't, and had fallen one day at work and hit her head. Now she's epileptic and her license is medically suspended.

It can happen in a blink of an eye, and suddenly your whole life is changed. Seriously. Get him looked at. "

Oh my goodness this one literally killed me. Poor guy. Just looking for some fitness tips.
"Yeah I was with ya up until the full-force kick to the head since that can definitely cause brain damage even with protective gear. Also just as a fellow martial artist it should be drilled into every fiber of your being that you only use martial arts for self-defense. And even if you wanted to teach him a lesson, why the head specifically? There were so many other options that were possible which you should know if you've sparred (Partly why I'm not 100% sure this is even real but if it is I'd rather give real advice to keep someone from endangering someone's life).

Definitely a fuck up on your part and the other to other people saying it's not a fuck up: yes he was being a jackass but that doesn't mean he deserves possible permanent brain damage for the rest of his life. You guys need to be more educated on how simultaneously strong/weak our bodies are and how martial artists are literally trained to know how to protect our weak points and abuse another's weak points in order to keep ourselves (our other) safe."

"I felt that pain... Because I have felt that pain- not once, not twice, but 3 times in my life I've had a bug decide to make my ear a home.

First time I ended up at the ER where they anesthetized the little bastard and then pulled him out. This process also resulted in my ear being totally numb, which meant I had no equilibrium, so I looked drunk when I walked.

After that incident, I read up on ways to get the bug out in case it ever happened again. And yes, water, oil, alcohol, etc works. Any kind of fluid really. But you need to be laying down with your ear pointed up. The bug wants to escape the fluid before it drowns, and instinctively tries to ""swim"" up. 

So the next 2 times I've had the displeasure of a bug, I used that trick. It works perfectly."

"To paraphrase Urban dictionary: 

YEET is a versatile word that can be utilised as a verb or a noun

It can be an exclamation to express happiness or excitement

E.g. If you make plans with friends to catch up and do something fun like going out, watching a movie, or doing cocaine, it is appropriate in this instance to exclaim “YEET!” as loud as you can

If employed as a verb, it is often used as a battle cry or focus-shout. 

When one utilises YEET in this manner, they are conveying that they are putting forth all their energy, their soul, their power, into an action.

E.g. “I YEETED the child into another plane of existence” 

This is all open to interpretation however, as one’s intention when employing the power of YEET can have various subjective meanings.

A simple rhyme I like to remember is, 

“Lest Ye be intending to catch all dis heat, all Ye be wary with the power of Yeet.”

TL:DR
It’s whatever you want it to mean

"Lmao that was too good. She's gonna remember this--I'm telling you now OP. I have 2 related stories:

I started my period at my dad's place when I was 11 (parents also separated). Luckily, I had sex ed at that point and knew I had to tell a parent. Although I really, really wished it was my mom. Too bad my dad lived 10 hours away from home so I couldn't just go back to Mom's. So I tell him--probably crying I'm sure--and he hugs me and tells me ""You're a woman now~"". It was maybe the worst thing he could have told me and I was mortified remembering it for years on end. He at least got me actual pads haha.

I worked at a grocery store when I was 18/19. When I was doing my sweeps through the aisles with the big giant broom, I got to the feminine care aisle and saw a regular customer looking lost and stressed. I knew he had at least one daughter since I saw them all the time. Plus I had conversations with him the times I was his cashier. So I asked him if he needed any help and he rambles that he's at home with the kids today and ""it"" happened, but the wife's at work and can't respond, so now he's lost in this forest of women's products he doesn't know anything about. I picked out my usual brand at the time and sent him on his way. He still looked pretty stressed though. Oh, dads lol."

"A beetle flew into my ear while I was asleep, as a teenager, only a few years recovered from my frequent childhood night terrors. I woke up with the sound of a helicopter directly in my brain and sharp pain. I ran screaming into my parents room, yelling that there about the helicopter or blender in my brain. Naturally they thought it was a night terror and proceeded to try to wake me up while I was screaming that my brain was being liquefied. Imagine my mom's horror when I tipped my head over and a few drops of blood came out. For a brief couple seconds, my night terror was reality for my parents. Then the beetle flew out. They took me to the ER just to make sure nothing was seriously damaged in there, and I had to use antibiotic ear drops for a few months."

OP's story isn't unique.  Tens of thousands of REAL people who aren't spammers operate under shadowbanned accounts, making millions of posts.

Consider whether or not the time and effort and passion people have put into posts, only to be aborted at the server by Reddit.

Consider whether or not the admins have, in sum, killed a human being for these stupid fucking shadowbans.

A bit moist!!
"Wtf, girls who are strong are hot as hell. Need me a girl who can yeet me"
Hope your lives are changed 👍

"Maybe they're super religious? That's the only thing I can think of. Because sane parents wouldn't shame their grown ass adult like this. I mean, they could have walked in on him and a girl he brought home the next morning. 

Also, I like your username 😁"
Should have left out the dialogue. Then it may have been believable. Good try though! 
"What are you doing, stepbro? "
Fuck that I'm pouring concrete in my ears
"I’d lose my shit at my family for going into my room and rearranging my bed regardless of what was there, bloody vibrator or not. I thought it was a given that the ‘under the bed’ hiding spot was a catchall for people’s private and/or icky bedroom related stuff. I couldn’t imagine doing that to someone! "
I heard it's great for healing broken limbs. Particularly arms.
I've never really understood that mentality.  I've always found it attractive when somebody can excel at anything.  I'm a pretty avid biker and was out biking once and some female just blew passed me on her bike.  Instantly attracted to her.
Your username checks out... Has it been flappy before or did it begin after fingering that sweet 87 year old woman
Oh man that's Definately coming up at a birthday or wedding
"I'm calling it now next update. 

TIFU mom walked in on me banging sister"
"It’s not my child, it’s my girlfriends. We’ve been dating for two months and only recently has she let me near her daughter. I’m green as hell when it comes to kids. Also, I figured Barney on a moderate volume was better than crying, and no one seemed to mind. Also, the PornHub adds are significantly louder than YouTube videos. "

I'd like to think so.

"Eh, sure it wayyyy easier to get sex, but sometimes it can all be really...shallow feeling...."
Fingers crossed. I want the follow up TIFU where he accidentally outed himself by providing too much detail on a TIFU.
"Same here, phew. But kinda funny when you think about it,  it means even clicking OP's story was enough to make us all relate to him enough that we'd rather it happen to anyone but OP. And make us not feel as bad if it's actually his brother in law divorcing - even though we don't have much of a connection to either. Interesting psychology. "
I think old people are usually good at that.
Do you have a degree in theoretical physics?
"Remembering the searing pain when that straw-like measuring thing went through my cervix...yeah no, there's no way in hell OP pushed a bottle through there."
"Almond Joy's got nuts, Lance only has one"
WTF did they want you to do with scissors?
"Thoughts and prayers, ya'll."
Explains why OP's mom is such a bitch!
"Yeah...not really.

You (for some reason) had your dick in your hand walking to the urinal.  You (for some reason) letting the spit out of your mouth and saying your ""mouth decided it"" despite it being...um...*your* mouth.  You (for some reason) not apologizing or explaining yourself but instead saying some odd one-liner.  And you (for some reason) kissing your friend to prove you aren't gay for...some reason.

Yeah, it wasn't the occurrences that were strange."
He *resists* the arrest.
Below her it seems
This reads like it was written by somebody who has never had sex.
I was actually laughing my ass off while writing it. Considering the last few days I've been trying to keep it to myself while mourning the loss of the best TV I've ever been able to afford..
What if you love someone truly stupid? Like your mom does?
I didn't even have a daughter yet when I was 24!

"...on the other side, I'm also in senior IT and help with interviewing. I mentally mark down resumes that are over page, and worse if it's more than two pages. If you have 10+ years of experience and can't trim that down to the absolute highlights I worry about your ability to edit and not get lost in unnecessary detail. 

This is why you can't win as an applicant."
"Better deaf than, uh, deaf."
"PSA: get checks on your vasectomy periodically!

My hubby had a vasectomy some time ago. We now have a 7 month old son and hubs is scheduled for a make up vasectomy. He was cut, folded cauterised and knotted but the little dude still found his way through. Turns out about 1/1000 vasectomies eventually fail. 

Our little dude is wonderful and I can't imagine life without him now but it was a hell of a shock when the pregnancy test came back positive lol!"
isnt there a murder every 26 minutes or something in Chicago? YIKES.
"Ok, that's funny. You really did put your foot in your mouth then, your poor daughter."
"Thanks for picking me up, mom."
"""Hi my name is Chris Hansen."""
Yoga mat recommendations: Jade fusion XL or XL beat grippy
Aaaaand this is exactly why my husband rubbed off alone before we had sex for the first time  post-vasectomy. Blood is a no-go for me.
"Yep, at that point his porn search would be very specific. “Black Malaysian hooker with faces blurred out, made before 1980”

"And a little card

"This could have gone so terribly bad... There was a story I heard about a couple that had pics of their little kids in the tub and the kids were taken from them.

Here, I found a ""fairly"" [recent article](https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2018/01/us-couple-s-kids-taken-away-after-innocent-bath-photos-reported.html) .  It was pretty crazy especially since ""The court also noted that none of the photos taken on the fateful holiday in 2008 were sexually suggestive nor showed the children's genitals.""

A month, some overzealous photo clerk, detective, and CPS workers took these kids away for a month. And it took ten years to clear their names and get their legal fees recuperated. So, I'm glad to hear you didn't fuck up by being thrown into foster care while your dad got killed in prison for child porn.

Plus, kids think buttholes are funny. When I was four, my six-year-old cousin thought it would be hilarious to spread our cheeks and kiss each others holes.... my mom caught us, and every couple of years she reminds me to try to embarrass me"
Fuck haha
"When I was 11-12, I was in a youth group because we were forced into the church life. During one of the sermons, the topic of lust came up. The pastor asked everyone to raise their hand when they heard a sin they committed that week. It got so weird, because after a few simple ones, he asks, ""and who has masturbated this week?"" We kind of all looked at each other in a state of confusion. Then he asked, ""Who do you think of when you masturbate? Is it someone here?"" And the level of cringe went through the roof. Most of us got up and left at that point. Someone told their parents what happened, because he wasn't allowed at the youth group after that. "
Hope you're doing ok now. We may be strangers but I have a van full of sweets if you ever want to talk
"Your whole profile is about you and younger men, including a step-grandson post... doesn’t sound like much of an TIFU for you"
clothing optional around family members seems super weird to me. guess my family is just prude af
Probably again the next night too
Yeah it’s that age where your body wants to
"Gotta love when someone starts with “throw away so I won’t be identified” and then proceeds to tell us where the attend school, their exact age, their schedule. I mean, anyone who knows you would be able to identify who you are easily."
Stop these shitty sex tifus
It's a lot to swallow
This comment is gonna lead a lot of users there lol
Tbf after the age of about 24 every dad should assume that his daughter has had cum one her face at least once.

"Well, we will never know if she *actually* kept the pee warm. And as a nurse who has worked in the ER, plenty of weird objects get trapped in the vagina that we have to sedate people to remove. And 5 hour energies are actually frequently used by women to smuggle clean pee. And if you can get a tampon stuck to the point you need intervention to get it out, yeah...slick, lubed up plastic ain't always coming out without a fight if vaginal suction is involved. This story is easily plausible."
Yes
"thanks, looking forward to having more next April"
You better buy that woman roses and chocolate tomorrow because she clearly loves you!
Who doesn’t shut their door when they’re going to rub one out?
"look at her post history she got a bunch of stories about her and her grandson on incest subreddits, shed probally want him to see her naked"
Well after remembering that I think it may be flappy for a while.

"They sometimes will revise the resumes a bit, but mostly they just want to scrub your contact info so their client (the hiring company) does not reach out to you directly."
"That guy definitely thinks you hook up with men in rest stop bathrooms, but your wife doesn't know."
I'd love to see the mods face in that sub or any of the others where suddenly an old invisible post john cena's the whole sub.
"I mean... The counter-argument is that OP isn’t able to delay gratification by not smoking for a few weeks leading up to a job interview. The ability to delay gratification has been proven to lead to better long term success. I don’t really agree with drug tests to begin with, (because they aren’t specific enough. Do whatever you want in your own free time, as long as you don’t bring it to work with you,) but if you’re applying for jobs, it’s probably a good idea to take a break from smoking every goddamned day."
"Heating pads are just the most amazing invention ever, especially for cramps! Smart move by your grandpa. "

"Every time I go to Hallmark, that card is out of stock."
"Agreed.  Guy was a mysogenistic asshole, but she knew her ability and did not insist on protective gear or stop the activity.  Instead her ego and emotions led to her risking serious injury or death for someone.  Sometimes you need to be an adult and realize there is no ""win"" with an asshole being dumb.  The correct response would have been to insist on proper gear and walk away if he refused."

"Bruh, chick could have messed him up seriously. Definitely a fuck up. 

But, it was a happy ending, and this isn’t AITA, so there’s no need to dwell on the negatives. 

I’m just glad she for a second date out of it and didn’t mess the guy up. "
I'm trying to figure out the logistics of how the tip of his dick was the first bit of his skin that she touched while doing all that.. since if she had touched any other part of his skin then that would have shocked her first instead.
Doesn't look like anything to me.
There's not a chance in hell this will ever be spoken of at that dinner. 
wait you guys aren't?
"I lost a tampon once on a date. I used to shove the string up there along with the whole thing, so the string wouldn't dangle down and annoy me. Dumbest habit ever.

There was these few minutes of true panic when I thought it was just going to be there for the rest of my life, and I was just frantically digging through my vagina..."
First mistake is always being born
Ever heard of a frat house lol
"And his wife has seen this post. I really hope this Tim guy doesn't see it as well, way to kick him while he is down.

I think OP just needs to really think before he speaks and acts. "
Rectum. Damn near killed him
"&gt; they can guarantee their kids are going to despise the couple for forcing them to spend time with the person that ruined their family unit.

That really does sound like a fuckin sure-fire way to make your kids hate you. Like, a lot."

"I am smiling after reading it, but am also in agony. I don't know what my body is telling me. Just thinking about that makes me want to walk off a cliff.

This guy has some composure if he didn't just try to highjack that plane so there would be no witnesses."
Am I the weird one here for not downloading any porn ever?
"Ive had bugs in my ear before too, that feeling is not something words can truly describe.

Im glad you didnt burn your house down, which is what i was expecting."

Thank you kind friend:)
