The cheating wife berating you for being insensitive is the funniest part of it all lmaoooooo
Scrotch tape
We are *definitely* gonna need an update on this
"Any can plant a seed, very few will stay to raise a strong tree.

Please tell your Dad you love him and he is your Dad regardless of everything."
You know he spent the whole rest of winter break trying to come up with the perfect pick-up line...
At least she didn't walk in and start celebrating. 
Its unfortunate that band aids for mens nuts havent been invented yet. 
"If there's nothing about your problem on the internet, there's a high chance you are just stupid"
Why would the cheating wife be there for this??
"Call your dad, make it clear you still see him as your father could really help him out."
"To quote Yondu, ""He may have been your father boy, but he wasn't your Daddy""

Hope you get through this."
"My soul left my body when I read the title, but had to return multiple times so that it could be violently ejected once again at each new paragraph.

Don't switch gynos! He sounds amazing, and it sounds like you'll be able to laugh it off with him once you've relived it a mere 60 more times in your head between now and your next pap smear."
"Who gets the whole family together to tell them they're getting divorced? How weird. 

Also, anybody who makes big announcements on April 1st is just asking for it. You did nothing wrong. "
"&gt; A blob of what I hope is lube 

If it wasn't lube, prepare for a five star review on yelp

&amp;#x200B;"
"is it wrong to ask for an update? very curious how everything turns out.


Your dad realizing his isn't your dad but your uncle, Grandparents now involved, its all such a weird situation. "
"""Mom, how did you and dad meet?  Dad said to ask you."""
and no one said a thing. I definitely feel like im on the bottom rung of the totem pole
"according to her new partners soon to be ex wife, she was actually caught on top."
"God, I’m so glad you didn’t fuck this up further. I’m happy for you, OP. "
"It was her decision to divorce. my brother in law is still open to working things out, but she is planning on starting over with the guy she had an affair with. 

As poor of a decision as this seems to be, I think she realizes that she is going to have some limited contact with this side of the family over the years.
"
When my grandma died her husband kept using her phone but didn’t tell anyone. 6 months after she died I got a call from her but I guess he butt dialed me because I picked up and just heard static and a muffled voice on the other end. Freaked me the fuck out
At least you didnt die and got off that habit man.  Drinking like that will kill you for sure as well.  I got bad withdrawals too when i quit drinking.  Im glad you are alive and stay sober its obvious you have a lot of people that love you =-)
Just made some guys fantasty come true. 
Should've whipped out the helicopter
Thank you for being brave enough to give us the photograph for proof. Love it. 
Clicked on this cause the title led me to believe that you thought your own divorce was a joke. This was still a great read though. That shits on them for choosing that day. 
Well I wish more people would say nice things about my ankles 
"I'm really sorry for your loss OP. Although, it's so wholesome to think when they answered the call, who they though was your brother, was actually his son. Almost like part of your brother was the one calling."
"She picks up the phone ""Rachel, the sonofabitch finally did it!! You get the champaign and I'll call those brothers we met at the bar last week"""
"Not your fuck up. They were grown adults and knew what they were doing. It's a shit way to find out, and the fallout isn't gong to be great, but imagine this coming out later.

You know now, and can make plans based on truth. Don't beat yourself up over it. "
Nice. Well if it does swell. You can tell the misses your gonna give her a good sting
I had something similar happen to me but it was in a grocery store and my boobs fell out of my dress that wasn't buttoned properly. No one said anything to me about it then and I've seen the same cashiers since and although I die a little on the inside it seems like they don't even remember the incident. I'm sure the people in your class should react the same way.. unless they're dicks lol 
He probably spent half the time thinking if what he heard was enough of a clear signal that she likes him. The guy way.
"I'm literally in the waiting room for a testicular ultrasound right now and I'm kind of scared/paranoid that it's cancer.  Reading this really helped reset and calm me down.  Thanks!  

Also, this is just going to be a funny/proud story for him later; I wouldn't freak out too much."
"Yeah man don’t assume blame. Get into contact and support your dad. Let him know that you don’t care about the test results and to you, he will always be your dad. He is going to need a ton of support from you right now. His wife and own family betrayed him for the past 20 years at least and he didn’t even know it. Find him and help him. Since you are an adult, try to get him through it as if it was one of your friends going through some major shit. Just try to reinforce that you two will get through it and try to perk him up a bit. "
Had to go back and reread some sentences because I was unsure whether “little bastard” referred to the wasp or OP’s vinegar dick.
Big question is how old is OP. If you’re an adult or close to one then fuck it. You called your cold mom out on a horrendous lie and biology or not your dad still raised you. You still have that bond with him and that doesn’t change. He just raised another man’s child as his own but once that initial sting wears off you both will still be ok. 
"I’m kind of shocked you could comfortably relax in Epsom salts with an open wound.

That shit burns. "
"I'd say the dad is the main victim here, with the double betrayal and the fact that his offspring not being truly his. That probably shakes something deeply engraved by our evolution.

As for OP, I totally understand your anger over the lie, but consider the fucked up fact that you wouldn't exist if it hadn't happened. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
"&gt; About a week later, a check for about 100 bucks comes for me in the mail from the city, which was of course from the cop guys 

Wait, what is this all about?! Like you get a refund from the police if they screw up and arrest you by accident?

&amp;#x200B;"
"&gt; Not your fuck up. They were grown adults and knew what they were doing.

I know I'm going to sound like that thin friend stuffing in a bar of chocolate saying ""I don't really have to watch my weight"", but that's how I feel here: Not having inadvisable sex with people when you could is piss easy. It's easy sober; it's easy drunk; it's easy high. 

Step one: Don't kiss people you shouldn't be kissing.

Step two: If you find yourself being kissed by a person you shouldn't be kissing; put your hand on their chest, gently push them away and tell them ""thanks, but no.""

Step three: Go home and masturbate. This step is important.

Optional step four (if you still feel deeply dissatisfied and unhappy): rethink your life choices. "
lmfao I might have had she not spoke up
and who brings the cheating wife to this sort of function?

Some dude in the class was thinking “titties pop out” and now thinks he has telekinesis or something.
Great. If this ultrasound gig doesn't work then I've been thinking of opening a massage parlor. 
"Happened to me freshman year.  I was swimming with this guy that liked me and our families because he was a family friend.  My bikini top snaps open and I flashed my family friend, his little brother, his parents, and my parents.  Great for the guy that was into me, horribly awkward for everyone else.  Don't wear string bikinis.  "

Is the cucumber used to verify the butt cheeks are separated ?

"I have to admit, I was a little hesitant at first. I’m glad that you appreciate it, it’s certainly the weirdest photo that I have of myself lol"
tbh I'd peg him if he's into it
"My dad passed away when I was younger (35 as well), and a couple years later I got my drivers license. My mom called my phone to see what I was out doing, and when I answered she said my dads name in a question kind of way. I was like “uhhh no?”, and I heard her tone get kind of sad, and she said “Oh, you sounded just like your dad when you answered” with a small chuckle at the end. 

It was a wholesome moment that made me sad about it all over. :(

My brother got my dads old phone number when he got a phone, and that was a whole other adjustment. A couple times I forgot and thought he was calling from beyond the grave."
"Umm, it was Moses that split the Red Sea. Noah was the boat dude.

I second this. 
That's a story you wouldn't tell your kids but happy tell your grandkids

"As a step child this comment really hit home. My (step) dad raised me a lot more than my bio ever did. Love makes a family, not always DNA"
"In less polite terms you could call it a bribe. Just a way for the cops to clear their conscience on that, really. Probably felt bad about scaring the crap out of the guy."
"oh I am insensitive, but you've been fucking the neighbor!"
Oh that would be sooo cute
That story is nuts. Spot on. 
"~~Rub n Tug~~

**Zap n Fap**"
"You both have to be INCREDIBLY CAREFUL about ever drinking alcohol again. If you ever get addicted again, getting off it without killing your self gets exponentially harder. Magnify your withdrawal symptoms by a factor of ten, hence the whole death thing. I went from drinking a bottle of gin a day for 2 years to sober in about two weeks. After I passing out from withdrawals I quit doing the whole “cold turkey” thing. I bought a small bottle of whiskey and a small bottle of jagermister. I sipped on them in ice cold shot glasses until I could get though the whole day on only one and then I quit. Fast forward 3 years and life takes a turn for the worst. My sobriety takes a 3/4 of a bottle of whiskey every day hit to the gut. Fast forward another year and my health is starting to go downhill fast and I need to quit. Anyway long story short replay level one again only this time it takes 4 months of “quitting” to get past the withdrawals. 3 months past alcohol passing my lips and I’m still physically fucked, I can almost walk a mile without falling over and dialing 911. please take my first hand advice and BE CAREFUL. "
"I had to show my penis to a super attractive doctor the other day, we’re about the same age as well and i give her mad props for looking me dead in the eye and shaking my hand afterwards. One of the most awkward experiences iv ever been in."
See if you can get him to let you fuck him in the ass
lol my father in law is an absolute champ he would have started stripping on the other end himself
Me too! Thanks :D
The amount of euphemisms in this story is too damn high!!!

"The only person at fault is your mother. *She* is the one who cheated. You don't need to feel guilty about exposing her guilt. Also, your real dad is the guy who raised you, not the guy whose genes are more similar. "
I'm also confused. Why would they give you $100?
"&gt;  hand to gland combat

That is the most uncomfortably awkward metaphor for masturbation I've ever come across."
Why would they announce this in April fools? It's like announcing you're pregnant. Just wait a day.
"When he went home I wonder if he mentioned you to his parents.

Have you met anybody nice, son?

Well, I do know this girl who would let me put it in her butt.

Wow, kid. That's love. Congratulations.

Thanks Dad."
I hope your procedure goes uhmm better?? Best of luck that it is nothing serious.

"I'm glad my story was able to give you and out of body experience! I feel like my own soul is in orbit somewhere. I cringed so hard, I feel as if my ow asshole turned inside out."
if you thought they were broken why would you not return them? who sits on a expensive headset if you was to believe it didn't work?
Everyone telling OP to reconnect with dad probably not getting that this dude is GONE. and a half.
Jesus man lol what a shitfest! Good on you for checking up on her tho!
"Maybe you should call your grandparents and see if you can stay with them a few days until things calm down. 

Not your fault though. Your mom had to realize that this would come to light eventually, it just happened sooner than she expected. "
TIFU by cuming on my ultrasound technicians face.
Made even creepier by the genuine look of joy at saying what you think is a perfectly normal compliment and in no way out of the ordinary or suggests you dine on people. 
"sadly he isn't going to be. She is(was) an amazing mother.

Good story."
Are your boys okay though
"I don't believe that. He may be gone from the mom's life but I can't see someone who is that broken up over a betrayal like that just abandoning their innocent child. And even if he's not his *biological* child, he's still basically his *adoptive* child that he raised and loved and loves him back. 

I don't think that's how it's gonna go down. "
Pretty sure I watched this video last night 
It normally isn't a big deal after a normal scan but it was a hard to even talk to him after this disaster.

"Ahhha a few months after my grandpa died my grandma took over his Facebook because she didn’t know how to make her own, it was so bizarre seeing my grandpas name pop up randomly liking and commenting on things.

At least this WASN’T a prank. Some Jack off played a prank on his friend by dying the water red and pretending he’d killed himself.

He let it go as far as his friend calling 911 sobbing.

Naturally his friend beat the ever loving shit out of him.

He got it all on tape. People thought it was funny. Me not at all until the kid beat the shit out of his friend ."
that should have been my response.... instead I went silent
"Wow, I would pay money to see a meeting like this go down. Who does this? So cringey.

I applaud you for doing what you did. Still laughing, 2 thumbs up!"
Damn. I don't normally comment on the TIFUs. I just chuckle and move on. This one was intense. I'm glad you're okay and I'm glad your wife is okay but holy crap dude. Your poor wife.
i didnt fuck my cat. i didnt cum on my cat. i didnt put my dick anywhere near my cat. Ive never done anything weird with my cats. I promised myself i wasnt going to make apology videos after last years thing so im just trying to be as short and honest with this as possible.

Yeah his brother fucked his wife and made his son and lied about it presumably for at least 16 years. Not sure that I could ever forgive either of them. The kid you raised is your son so you make it work with him but wife and brother are out

I just bought a sports bra that has a front zipper (never owned one like that before) and was so curious what the point of the inner hook was so I haven't been using it. I  just realized that I was putting my breasts and the world in the mercy of a flimsy zipper. Oh geez... definitely gonna be using that extra hook from now on.

"Am I have similar consumption ( probably for about 5 years now) half a bottle of whiskey a day, I drink plenty of water and can go multiple days without physical side effects. I however hate my relationship of 7 years and just as things get good and I taper off shit goes off and I drink to not loose my sanity. 

She literally cares so little that she doesn’t even notice when I’m shit faced. And that just makes it worse for me.

"I wax myself and there’s two reasons i can think of why this happened. Either the wax strips were shitty or your hair was too long. Hair that’s too long of thick needs to be trimmed before waxing.

"My mother in law would have cheered me on, and that's not a good thing, its disturbing.

&amp;#x200B;

A few examples..... After having been married for about 5 years still without children (intentionally) she told me, ""You need to start shooting a couple live rounds up in there, I need a grand baby"".

&amp;#x200B;

It was only a couple of months ago, my wife had a pair of cut-off jean shorts sitting on a chair.  My mother in law picked them up and said to my wife, ""you think these could get any shorter"".  I chimed in sarcastically, I keep cutting a 1/4"" off of them every chance I get"".  My mother in law then brought them over to me and laid them out on the table.  She then took her finger and drew it around the crotch of the shorts and said, ""That's what you should be cutting out"" and give an elbow and a double eyebrow nod."

"So long as you're moderately attractive, you can't really fuck up by telling a guy that you're into him.  "
"When I was about 30, I had to have a testicular ultrasound. The tech who came in was a really attractive woman about my age, and I remember worrying that I'd get aroused (or, somehow worse, shrivel up). She said she was training in a new tech and asked me if I'd mind there being another person. I figured it wasn't like it could get more awkward and said sure, and she came back in with a simply stunning girl in her early 20s. 

As uncomfortable as it was at first, it went okay. When I get uncomfortable, I get silly. She told the trainee, ""The first thing we do is set the machine for small parts,"" and I said ""Hey! Some of us are sensitive! Couldn't you say 'delicate' instead of 'small'? Diminutive? Precious? Compact?"" They giggled and the atmosphere in the room got a lot lighter. She made some little jokes along the way, which I appreciated, and I didn't feel mortified when I left.

I would have been a lot happier if she had used the word ""impressive"" though."

"I have some old people advice for you, if you want.  Here it is:

This may be impossible to imagine right now, but this may end up being the best thing that ever happened to your family, if only because truth has a way of coming out anyway.  Finding it out like you did and ripping the lid off of it prevented anyone from being able to lie their way out of it, which as hard as it may be to imagine right now is everyone's best hope of coming out of this with their relationships and marriages intact, if that's even possible.  

Including you: it's much harder to take this kind of news at 50 than it is at 19, so you've done yourself a favor as well by getting it over with early.  Because of you, your kids don't have to live the lie that you did, and you can be done with this drama in your youth.  I know it all seems crazy right now, but you WILL find the new normal, and it will be okay in the end.  There IS peace for you in this, though you still have some storms to weather first.  

DO NOT let anyone put this on you.  Not now, not ever.  Including yourself, which may be hardest of all.  The fact of the matter is that if you hadn't gotten the DNA test, someone else in your family might have, even your own children in the future, and ripped open the same can of worms.  This situation was not of your making, and you owning it only prevents wounds from healing.  

Truth is the best disinfectant, and is the only hope of saving these relationships (IF they can be saved at all) so don't you dare let anyone put this on you.  And if they do, correct them in a way they won't easily forget, because blaming you and/or the DNA test is not just a lie, it's outright cruel and evil.  Responsibility belongs where it belongs, and it may be up to you to remind others of this in the future.  Don't hesitate to do so.  By insisting on truth, you will be doing the entire family a service, and bringing the quickest possible end to the drama.  Lies only stretch out the agony, and it doesn't matter whose lies they are, so don't own it.  Any of it.

If you can, in time consider forgiving your mom and bio-dad.  Shit happens.  It just does.  And you don't forgive people because they -deserve- forgiveness, nobody does.  You forgive when and where you can just because humans make mistakes, you do too, and it's the best way to save relationships.  Shit happens, for all you know it was a drunken one-nighter they've both felt shitty about ever since, and what's happening right now is more than enough punishment, if you think about it.  So when you're good and ready, NOT before, and IF it seems right to you, consider forgiving them.

As others have said and I can only reiterate, your now-step dad is blameless in this and has gotten his entire marriage thrown into chaos overnight.  Be there for him, in any way you can.  Ditto your half-sister cousin.  You won't regret it.

Also, unless you want to hear redneck family tree jokes, be VERY careful who you tell in real life.  I know you need support and people with whom to discuss this, just... be careful.  Let it go on Reddit all you like, it doesn't matter, but in real life you can't put this genie back in the bottle.  If it gets out, it gets out, but try to keep a lid on it until YOU are ready to talk about it, for your own sake.

Finally, I have to tell you as an older person that this thing has only just started.  You have miles to go before this thing winds down, and unseen changes yet to come.  But you're gonna be okay, and so are they: of all the evils in the world, this is one of the lesser ones, and everyone gets to live at the end.  As hard as this may be (and I don't underestimate it at all) try to keep it in perspective, because that helps with sanity over the long run.

I wish you well.  Good luck, kid."

"Seriously, I was confused at how OP thought any amount of stopping the bleeding would matter if he was going to immediately soak it for an extended period of time."
"One of the most confusing days of my life was when I had to get an MRI for a persistent low level ache in one of my testicles (which turned out to be torsion).

First tech is a 60 year old Chinese lady who destroys my testicle by jamming the sensor into it and basically grinding down hard enough I'm in agony.  I have to tell her to stop as she didn't really seem to know what she was doing.  She leaves the room and I clean up not knowing what is going to happen next.

After a couple of minutes in comes super hot 20 year old tech who seems very inexperienced as well.  She applies whatever liquid they use to my testicles while inadvertently making eye contact and I instantly have the largest erection of my life while still in pain from the previous tech and the torion i have going on.  

I'm not sure if I was blushing more than her but it was a pretty close race.  

To her credit she professionally finishes the MRI and then leaves the room with a wry smile while I have to lay there for another 10 minutes waiting for things to subside before getting dressed and heading back to the waiting room for the results.

After maybe 20 minutes i head back in to see my very attractive 30 something year old doctor who explains what torsion is and how she can manually deal with it and I'm instantly erect just from hearing her describe what she needed to do.

Awkward manual detorsion then occurs with me not daring to open my eyes."

2.) Last night (now in my thirties) she called me to tell me the following. ""[Friends Name] came to see me at work today. Was talking about [Mutual Friend]'s new girlfriend. Did you know she has a sea shell tattooed on her inner thigh?"" ""No, really?"" ""Yeah if you put your ear to it you can smell the ocean!""

Well at least he’ll never do that again. AND he’s got a story for the grandkids.
"I’m surprised no one here messaged that he could have talked to his dad first. OP behaved like a 19 year old in pain. I think the only thing he could have done differently was give it the 24 hour rule and speak to his dad privately first. Not giving his dad a heads up (the person he was seemingly closest with) is a big mistake to me. He went in guns blazing and did the scorched earth method on a mother he doesn’t really care for. Obviously, this family dynamic has more issues then paternity. I think Dad deserved to hear it from son first, then approach mom together. Maybe his dad would have decided to spare him the rage pain and deal with mom. As it stands, hiding in a bedroom isn’t particularly mature, and I bet his “dad” needs his support right now. "

BIL starts telling her that this is how his mom died.  Took a nap and never woke up (some undiagnosed heart problem).  They both come over to check on me but I don't hear them banging on the door.  She has a key but I dead bolted the door and there was no key for that.  They get the landlord involved but she doesn't have a key, either.  BIL starts to talk about how he bets I'm cheating and too afraid to answer the door.  They are even banging on the wall in the vacant apartment that shares a wall with my bedroom, right behind my bed.  Eventually I wake up, open the front door.  Everyone is standing there.  Future wife is crying.  She's so pissed at me for not answering and I have no idea what is going on.  She was pretty certain I was dead.  I think she overreacted.

"One time, I was making stir fry with my then girlfriend, and I  added some  ginger to enhance the flavor. I asked her if she wanted to try some fresh ginger, because she had never done that before. She told me, ""only if you try some first"". I like ginger, and have no problem with chowing down on fresh ginger root, so I took a big bite, and thoroughly enjoyed it. She cautiously took a bite, and immediately went red and made little noises, all the while accompanied by my laughter. She ended up marrying me, but she still doesn't like ginger. Good thing I'm not a red head!"

It's one of those things you don't want to change.
"You NEED to go and see a Doctor. The problem isn’t a problem, it’s 3 problems: Your shitty relationship, your drinking, and your depression, and they’re all feeding into each other.

Depression on its own is bad enough but even though it feels like drinking is the only way to keep your head above water, what you don’t realise is that you’re just drowning in something else instead.

I don’t know your girlfriend or wife but I’m sure it’s hell on her as well to see you the way you are all the time. Maybe that feeds some of her bad behaviours, maybe it doesn’t - she could be an absolute angel being terrorised by your drunken abuse, or she could be an absolute devil who subjects *you* to emotional torture and mind games that would turn *any* man insane - I obviously don’t know, but I can guarantee the truth will appear much different to you without the lens of alcoholic depression.

Instead of seeing the problem before the end goal, try looking at the end goal first and working backwards from there. Where do you need to be to be happy? Maybe living on your own with your dogs? Okay, what happens just before that - you find your own apartment, but with what money? Maybe get a different job or find a way to save to move out. How best to do that? Maybe you can stay with one of your parents in the meantime while you get back on your feet. But to do that, you have to get the courage to leave. How? Start on the road to fighting depression. Start taking any medication you may need, and get the coping skills you need so that you won’t feel the need to drink to numb your pain. Do that by seeing a doctor.

Think of it like a video game - you don’t fight the end boss right away, that would be suicide. You start by getting stronger - solve small problems first, and once they’re out of the way, you move on to bigger challenges. They will ALWAYS be challenging, but the point is that you build on what you achieved yesterday to conquer tomorrows problems. You make yourself stronger bit by bit at a time.

I get there will be some major seemingly impossible problems, like maybe the dogs are hers and she won’t give them up, but by that point it won’t seem like an end boss you can’t beat, you’ll be strong enough to find the right solution when you need to. It’s impossible now, sure, but just trust that it will be possible then, one way or the other."
i just got super excited but reddit law states that op never delivers.
"Sorry your wife is traumatized. Hopefully you guys are both on the mend.

Side note: my husband loves baths. He soaks in epsom salt quite a bit since he has various metal rods and screws holding him together which can cause some soreness if he’s been active. We call these “grown ass man baths”"
"Nah, I don't know much. Just that men are simple creatures. Way more simple than women assume. We all act more confident than we are. And we all want a short list from our SO:

1) We want someone who laughs at our shitty jokes. 

2) We want someone who touches our pp at least once a week

3) We want someone who understands that needing time for ourselves is not the same as not wanting to spend time with you. 

4) We want someone who helps us forget just how shitty life can be, someone to be there when we get home, hug us and lie that everything will work out. "

I guess the real question. Is did you notice a full luxurious body lift afterward? Is your penis holding it's  curls longer? 
I don't know. if I hadn't fucked up we may have been able to ask this
"A few years ago, my wife had surgery on a couple nerves in her leg. Obviously, slicing up nerves is a painful procedure, so she stayed pretty medicated for the two days or so she was in the hospital and was still well doped up when we got home. We got back from the hospital, got her situated in her favorite recliner, then I went out to fill her prescriptions.

When I got home, I walk in the door, into the room, and see her in the recliner, eyes closed, head lolled to the side, blood running out of her mouth and down her chin and neck. Even in the second and a half it took to rush over to the chair, I'm thinking she must've bit her tongue and choked on the blood and passed out and oh god, it's been 10 years since I was certified in CPR am I going to remember?!?!

I get to her, reach out and she immediately, but groggily starts moving. I start asking what happened, is she OK? She says she's fine, just dozed off, has no idea what I'm going on about. I tell her she's bleeding, there is blood running out of her mouth.

She says ""no I'm not"" and reaches up to her mouth to check - with the bag of Very Cherry Jelly Bellies she had been munching on still in her hand. She hadn't been bleeding, just drooling red-stained saliva. Ten years later and she still thinks it's the funniest damn thing that's ever happened (once I got over the shock, I couldn't help but agree)."

"They remember. I've worked a lot of jobs and quite a few retail/sales jobs. 

I remember all the embarrassing, horrifying and disgusting things people have done. I remember their faces even years later. 

I remember the cute African chick that happened to start her period as I set up her new phone. And I remember coming back to the counter to find the evidence on the white chair she was sitting in. 

I remember accidentally being flashed when I was 11 at the public pool. We remember all of it."
"All of this is pretty cute and all, but what was wrong with his testicles?"
"Biggest problem with this argument is that you’re ignoring the casualties of the lie. The father who was cheated on was robbed of the chance to write his own story. If he had known 19 years ago that this kid wasn’t his, he might’ve bailed, met someone else and fallen in love again, had a completely different life than the one he has now. That’s time he’s never getting back. Those possibilities were all robbed from him the moment the mother and uncle decided to cover up their mistake instead of coming clean. "
"That was an ultrasound, not MRI. Major difference in the two modalities. "
"Oh, they remember.  ; )"
"100% this. Your uncle may have ""fathered"" you biologically. But your dad.. Your dad's your dad/ in every way that counts never forget that and make sure he knows it too. You both were harmed by a shitty cover up, by people you trust. You didn't do anything wrong. "

You don't even need a pickup line when a girl has openly admitted she'd let you fuck her in the arse. 
I think Tim is still under the impression that she is going to come back to him and that they can work through this. He's basically doing anything that she is asking in hopes that she will come back.

That masturbate thing is very important advice. Do it before dates. This way you'll know if you actually like the other person and are not just horny. 
"Establish your dominance!

Masturbate on your sister's bed too!

Masturbate in the living room as well!

*Let the juices flow!*

*May it shower everywhere!*

*Mark your territory!*

*Be the Alpha!*

I'm glad this wasn't what I thought it would be.

"It’s not that he didn’t care for his mother. He was enraged and wanted to know the truth. It’s extremely difficult to keep those emotions at bay. 

OP, I’m sorry you’re going through this. You’ll definitely feel guilt, though cognitively you could tell it’s not warranted guilt. Your mother and uncles affair is not on you. Chances are, it would’ve surfaced somehow eventually anyway. Better sooner than later.

You should call your dad"
