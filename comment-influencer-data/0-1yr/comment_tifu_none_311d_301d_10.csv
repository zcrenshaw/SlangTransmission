"[That they've publicly said they reversed the decision](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canadian-pot-industry-workers-border-1.4858534), and then do it anyway doesn't surprise me. If you feel like being a test case you could see if any legal groups have an interest with working your case."

"YOU NEED TO LOCK YOUR SHIT DOWN LIKE YESTERDAY

It wouldn't surprise me one bit if in that batch of 900 people there are at least a few assholes who decide to steal your identity. Assuming this happened a few hours ago, you need to take action **NOW**

1. Get an identity theft PIN from the IRS - simple enough to do [right here](https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams/get-an-identity-protection-pin) and I would say you qualify because 900 people now have your tax information.

2. Freeze your credit reports - This is free now and I'd recommend anyone who gets any information stolen do this, that can be done [here](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2018/09/free-credit-freezes-are-here)

3. Keep an eye on your credit **for years** - At some point, you're going to have to lift the freezes to get a loan or credit card or something. If you're moving, having a credit freeze can be a pain in the ass if you need a credit check for utilities, mortgage/rent, etc. Even with a freeze, if someone has enough personal information about you, they may be able to lift it themselves. You can rotate out each credit report every 3 months through [Annual Credit Report](http://annualcreditreport.com)

What you cannot do is to sit back and think it's going to be fine without doing anything. In all likelihood, it will be fine if you go through everything above, but if you just think it will go away in a month or two you're sadly mistaken.

**Edit** - I don't mean to scare you (maybe just a little bit) but this is a serious thing that can reverberate long after today.

**Edit 2** - r/StopIDTheft is where I'll be posting more about this. It happened to me once, it was a shitty 3 months but I learned a lot by studying up on what to do/not do. **[Here's a not-quite exhaustive list of resources that you might want to consider](https://np.reddit.com/r/StopIDTheft/comments/9wl7sl/links_which_will_help_you_if_you_get_your/)**"

"You should see my hair right now.  I asked for a hard part, and the lady gave me a hard part, and shaved *straight down* all of the hair growing outwards from my temple towards my eyes.  

I wasn't wearing my glasses during the haircut, so I didnt notice until I got to my car.  Once I came back inside to ask ""what the fuck,"" the guy sitting in the chair hopped up and said, ""No thanks"" and left.  When one of the other barbers looked at me she whispered, ""Oh no... what was she thinking?""

My sentiments exactly.  I feel for you, dude.  I really really do."
That’s what she said?
"Because so many international flights will transfer in the US and transferring in the US requires going through immigration even when you just want to change planes, being banned from the US can have huge consequences. My wife recently flew from Ecuador to Dubai. She had to take the most roundabout expensive flight to avoid transferring flights in places she didn’t have a visa. Literally flew from Quito to Lima to Buenos Aires to São Paulo, and then to Dubai instead of the quick cheap flight with one stop in either Miami or NY. "

"While it is your fault for not checking FAFSA, it is arguably also the college's fault for not telling you about it sooner.

If they had told you that they weren't receiving money from you right when it started happening, then you could've had it fixed long before it reached this point.

I'd sue the college for that tbh. You fucked up, but they fucked up more. You shouldn't be the only one dealing with the consequences of this."
This doesn't make sense. At my college you cannot enroll for another semester without paying off the balance of the previous one. Either the fafsa in his school forgot to put a hold on his account or they totally forgot he didn't make the payments and then suddenly someone in the office realized and decided to pull this shit. Something is definitely off

"Look, I'm not one to go all /r/thatHappened on every story ever, but this doesn't make any sense. CSU, CU, and MSU all have policies that if you don't pay your tuition, you can't register for the following semester, so it's not possible for you to have continued taking classes for a full year after failing to renew your FAFSA. Even if it wasn't one of those three, I can't imagine any of the other colleges in CO have vastly different policies. They all also send you to collections, so you would've been receiving collections calls long before the two year mark. There's either more to the story that you're not telling, or you made it up."

A few weeks ago I made ramen and filled the bowl to the top. I wasn’t super smart and decided that instead of using oven mitts to transfer the soup to my coffee table where I could watch tv I would instead just use a paper towel in both hands. . . Which was stupid because as a small amount of boiling liquid spilled onto my hand the shock caused about a cup full to also spill. . .and there I was somehow in so much pain that I wanted to drop the bowl but was also lucid enough to realize if I dropped the bowl I would have to clean a broken bowl and deal with boiling liquid all over my feet. . .so I continued my walk with my hand shaking and soup still spilling over it. . .was fucking awful.

Or rather, imagine you're facing to the right, and draw a vertical line touching the right side of your sideburns, and shave all the hair connected to your head to the right of that line.

She turned my hard part into a perfect right angle of baldness.

I'm a 28 year old white male from the UK. I'm pretty stern, rarley show my feeling to anyone but close family and friends.

BUT! I actually did a little cry at this, like the rollercoaster of feelings. Reading how you treated yourself because you finally could to something you wanted as a kid. I related to this quite a bit, I know it's not the same but I didn't have the same as other kids, I wasn't terribly poor but people had better things and sometimes I couldn't have toys everyone else had. So when I got older and had a good job . I actually bought alot of the toys I wish I'd tried as a kid and it brought lots of joy.

But then to read how it broke! I was gutted for you, I tried to picture how sad you must have been , I didn't remember reading anything about you so I played it through a few times in my head  with you been Female/male and all the options! Which just made me sadder!

I hope that the younger generation, our kids if we have them, never go without but still learn to earn rather than just want!

I wish you all the best :)

I don’t believe OP. There are waaaay too many parts of the process that tell you how much you owe each semester and lock you out of registering for classes.

"My grandmother, grandfather, and uncle all died within a three day period (independently; not in the same event or anything).  On the day of my grandmother's funeral, I received a call from my sister, asking me if I could pick her up from work to go to the funeral.  Sure.  No problem.  I picked her up and we drove the couple miles to the chapel attached to the funeral home.  We were hung up in traffic and struggled with parking, so we arrived just in time for the service to begin.  There were limited seats remaining, so we sat some distance from each other.

When the service began, the minister began the service by saying, ""We're gathered hear to celebrate the life of our dear departed Peggy.""  I glanced at my sister with a confused look, and she glanced back at me with a similarly confused look.  My grandmother's name was ""Mabel"".  The chapel was filled with my family, so I knew I wasn't at the wrong funeral...hmmm...OMG; the minister has his 1pm and his 2pm script mixed up!  I was convinced the minister had made a mistake, until the life he was describing certainly seemed like what little I knew of my grandmother's life.  Eventually, I determined that some people knew her as ""Peggy"".  Turns out her third husband, with whom I was not close, had given her the pet name ""Peggy"" and when they moved to his community, everyone, including her minister, knew her as ""Peggy"".  She always came to visit me, and so the name ""Peggy"" was unknown to me.

When the service ended, we were leaving the chapel when my sister turned to me and said, ""Did our grandmother die?""  You see, she had received a call from my father, who, assuming she had already heard of her grandmother's demise, had told her ""I just wanted to let you know the funeral will be on Tuesday at 1pm; see you there.""  My sister, knowing of her uncle's recent demise, assumed my father was talking about my uncle's funeral.  Nobody had told her that her grandmother had died.  She found herself at a funeral for some woman named ""Peggy"", also not knowing that my grandmother had a pet name.  We were half way through the service before she started to suspect her grandmother may have died.

TL/DR: My sister was at the right funeral, but didn't know who had died.
