"I'm just stunned she doesn't have the documents saved anywhere else. You mean you're hitting 'print,' with a dead printer, closing the document, then repeating this FOR TWO MONTHS. "
"I once replaced an employee's old tower PC sitting on his desk with a SFF PC sitting under his desk. Except I didn't take away the old tower right away. Instead I waited until the middle of the day and, while he was working on the PC, came up, grabbed the totally disconnected tower, and walked off with it. He was a bit dumbfounded. "

This is a new level of user logic right here.  Saving to the Recycle Bin has nothing on saving to the Print Queue.
"and here's me sending emails to O2 which read ""Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD I ALLOW AN UNQUALIFIED USER ACCESS TO THE NETWORK CABINET!"" when they ask us to 'have a user at a location check the comms cabinet."
"As I once told my Flight Commander (Captain) when called in to work an email outage on a Saturday night

&amp;#x200B;

""No problem, sir. I can troubleshoot drunk, I just can't drive."""
"How did he, an electrical engineer, not know what a Faraday Cage is?

Baffling."
"People Think that a screen is a computer and there is nothing more, i have had a commedore 64 with me to School ones, and everybody was dumbfounded about why i had a keyboard with me, and no computer."
"&gt;I patiently explained to her the difference between ""Internet Explorer"" and ""Google Chrome"", re-pinned IE to the taskbar, and she is now all happy.


&gt;Well, until the next call...

""When you fixed my Google Prime issue last month you broke my printer just now."""
"Decent meth doesn't have much of a smell. You're smelling the solvents and other stuff used to cook it. Meth labs smell a lot worse than the finished drug.

**Edit:** Thanks tfts and everybody that helped make this my most-upvoted comment. I hope future employers don't sort by karma. For more drug talk, I recommend Derek Lowe's blog [In the Pipeline.](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/)"
"&gt;""well it's your fault I missed the exam.""

No, it's not. And the ridiculousness of that statement tells me she should go back to elementary school, because she clearly needs to develop basic social and thought processing skills.

Don't be sorry for anyone else's poor life choices, OP. And that was clearly one very poor life choice."
This sounds like he knew what he was talking about just that he needed confirmation. I always respect the people that do that because they just need it in writing. It’s not like their intelligence is in question. 
"Lack of USB ports is a security feature.

&lt;.&lt; &gt;.&gt;"
Can confirm. I have a dual monitor setup and a nonzero amount of people have asked me why I have 2 computers.
Sometimes I worry about what would happen to my job security if other people learned how to actually troubleshoot something.
Any idea how old? I have to look at the mom and wonder what type of boundaries she has set her kids as far as how to act in public
"Owww! Stop it. You're making my eyes bleed!!!!!

Yes, I have seen this out in the wild too."
"Hey you got time away from the office w/pay, so it’s not all bad, right?"
Send message to Jenny's boss requesting a training session on proper document retention procedures.
"&gt; A week later I send an email to the customer telling them our rates have increased, I gave them a 100% rate increase. This is how I fire customers. I don't outright tell them not to call me again, I just jack up their prices so they go somewhere else. 

Oooh, that's a nice technique. I can see me copying that."
I'm imagining you trying to diagnose this remotely. Thank goodness you could go look at the physical setup.
"If I had to guess I guess around 6, 7, or 8. They were speaking full sentences up until the screaming started "
This makes no sense. It's not saved in the printer queue just a copy of it is. She would have to send to the printer queue and then delete the stuff she's working on. Who on Earth would do that... oh wait nevermind. 
"Yeah, the owner of a company I worked for went to all the laptops in one location where they worked on car electronics and epoxied all the USB ports and burned the CD Rom's lenses with a soldering iron, writer or not, he destroyed all of them. He was so proud of his security implementation."
Bank workers shut off a fan they didn't enjoy listening to. $10K in melted Cisco gear.
Well there was the one time I accidentally shutdown the mail server after updates instead of rebooting it... My boss had to drive in.
"That's the thing, Faraday Cages are a presence on both of those.

I'm not an expert, but I'm fairly certain you can't go through an electrical engineering degree without being introduced to what a Faraday Cage is along the way, because those cages also serve as protection against stuff like lightning strikes."
"Oh man that hurts. I love how users always just casually mention they did something that makes you want to pull your hair out.

Like today I got a call 'we moved all the printers around and now they're not working. Can you resolve this asap?'.

(Edit: after many calls and e-mail advise yesterday I just checked the print server to see their printers are online again. Of course no one felt like letting me know it's resolved.)"
GoogleBing Lady upgraded to Google Prime
"Exactly why I like visiting clients + I don't have to sit on my ass all day.

Also can always pop in to fast food to eat or something, and still get paid for it."
If you say so!  I never did much more research into it.  
"That one is more understandable though, i can imagine the look of confusion on his face"
"Had a user tell me something was ""beeping"" in a closet and it was a box that they unplugged but the internet went down so they plugged it back in. I had them send me a picture and it was the battery backup connected to the network switch. Yup leave it alone bud, we'll send someone out. "
"A great teacher of mine once told me ""IT is 10% knowing what to do, and 90% knowing what to google."""
"Rule 0: Users lie.
Rule 0.5: Sometimes, bosses believe them."
"I had an EE ask me what would happen if someone licked a PoE powered Ethernet jack. I told him nothing, and that I didn’t want to know what he did in his spare time. 

Had another engineer (don’t know the type) if he wanted to power a lamp in a corner w/o a power plug with some sort of wireless power tech. I looked at him with as straight of face as I could muster and said “you mean a battery?”  

EEs never cease to amaze me"
"One time I was sitting at my desk (dual monitors) and a friend came in and said, ""What's the other one for?""

I wasn't sure what he was talking about, so without thinking I moved the mouse cursor to the second monitor and asked, ""You mean this?""

My friend literally jumped and yelped as if I'd just detached my hand from my wrist or something. 

Apparently he thought it was a huge feat of computering genius that I was able to move my mouse from one to another. And this was a guy who I thought was fairly computer savvy, too. He knew the difference between monitors and computers, but thought it had to be a 1:1 ratio."
Yeah I didn't get that either. Surely she must have them saved somewhere? For my own sainity I refuse to believe she doesn't. I don't understand why she can't just print again?
"I can guarantee that someone in the class did actually notice it but chose not to speak out because of social pressure and the way relationships in schools work. It is easier to just shut up and do nothing in situations like that.  
Sad reality of modern education."
"I despise that attitude. I deal with people every day who are ""computer illiterate"" or whatever you want to call it, and I have no problem with them. Anyone can be taught!

But ""I'm not a computer person"" signals that the person has *given up* on even the mere concept of expending any effort to learn. You know right out the gate that there's no point in bothering with trying to teach them anything, because they've already decided that they're not going to learn."
"If you plug an error message into Google, you'll typically get about ten responses.  One of these tells you exactly what you need to do, three of them will help but don't actually address the source of the problem, five of them are just other people asking the same question but not finding any answers, and one of them offers advice which could cause a warp core breach destroying everything within a fifty kilometre radius.

A big part of IT isn't just knowing how to ask the question, but also knowing which answer is which."
Or half the class noticed but the coach insisted that couldn't possibly be the problem and they didn't know what they were talking about.
"As long as my company continues to be cheap and outsource 50% of their work to lowest-bidder contractors, I'll be fine.  

  

At least, until they move us to ""The Cloud"""
I've actually volunteered to be the one to deliver information to a family member specifically so that they can be mad at me rather than their spouse/sibling/offspring/etc. That usually nets me a very high survey rating from the original caller.
Oh my god. Can comments be tagged as NSFW?
Perhaps I should add one more detail. Our IT is all guys who know a grandson of the owner.  And none of them can legally drink.
"&gt;""googling for answers to problems isn't real IT work"" and he will no longer be wasting his time with us.""

lmaooooooo I guess he thinks that answers will fall from the sky! and that folks will continue to give him the answers to every single ticket and issue

"I know, but rules are that the person that is responsible for the office (Office manager) knows the code. The office is a long time travelling from the head office, she needs to know in case of something happens. There is also some of the electricity equipment in that same closet, sometimes you gotta work with what you got. "
Why on Earth would one shred a hard-copy contract after scanning? Even if it is uber sensitive. 
I'd go one further and guess that his wife has been yelling at him for finishing the movie on data when he figured he could be on wi-fi
Honestly thanks for this comment. I was on the verge of a mental breakdown after that call. Now I'm laughing like a madman on my own in the office.
"Kids now grow up around expensive tech. When I was a kid, my family didn't have all that so what we did have was taken the most care of because it was so expensive."
"Absolutely this. I've had numerous people bring just their monitor into the shop, thinking it was the computer. For some reason, it never occurs to many of them to wonder what the giant box is for. Others think its either ""the modem"" or ""the power supply"". Which leads to the other group of people, who call asking if I fix modems - when they mean to say computer. It's a fun game we play."
Sounds to me like he was going to skip this exam anyways and wanted a scapegoat that his professor's will totally believe and bend over backwards to accommodate...
"Wouldn't be crazy to see a 4 year old doing that too, even if they act like that"
"The folks who support industrial process machines (think injection molders / sheet metal press / robotic welder) have posted many a tale about their *big expensive machine* being contolled by a PC that is running Win 98 on an x486 CPU and proprietary serial ports that  **can't** be upgraded because **no one** makes the physical parts anymore nor is anyone supporting the special mods that were made to the OS and controller program (and they've lost the source code years ago).

Shudder."
