"Not a question but a comment;  ""Only"" having two friends does not make you a loser.  It always weirds me out that people seem to think you have to have a million friends to be okay.  If the two friends are good friends, that's a total success.  Anyway, you seem sort of sad about it all, so good luck and I hope you feel better soon!"
"Hey, I made this as a throwaway account, but I saw your post. I'm so sorry to hear that. My brother committed suicide about two years ago, on Thanksgiving of all days. He was really, really sad and alone. He was a good guy. I don't need to ask you anything, I just want to say I hope you're doing OK. Stay strong for the people who love you"
That’s exactly what it was! And she’s RUSSIAN. I’m RUSSIAN. It was a RUSSIAN SALON! The police officer was RUSSIAN and speaking to her IN RUSSIAN
"Hi.

I'm an insomniac, too. I can't fall asleep without white noise, or when it's dark. Makes normal life pretty tough. Booze has been my fallback position for ten years. It's not sleep, but it's better than lying awake for 72 hours with your mind wondering how to end the pain.

It's a downward spiral. I know it, you know it, everyone who's been there knows it. I don't know how it ends. But PM me if you want to talk about it. It may, or may not, help, but at least you have someone whom you don't have to meet, and understands your situation.

"Oh man, you've seriously jinxed yourself now! Literally a week ago I thought the exact same thing to myself. Felt really smug that in, what 20 years of phone ownership, after some 10 different phones, not once had I cracked any of the screens. Guess what I'm looking at right now?! That's right, around 12 cracks from one single drop, right in the middle of my screen. Honestly, you keep us updated with how long it takes. I expect to see your ""I cracked my first ever phone screen. AMA"" within a week.

I was getting them dyed first and then she was going to pluck them. She got arrested while the dye was setting in. 
"Batteries for now, getting a generator probably next week. The cabin is on wheels so built it on my neighbours yard, and right now it is located in a family land. So I basically got a place for the cabin for free, buying some land would have delayed the project buy few months. Planning on buying the land underneath me at some point though.  I have no running water, and I have no septic system here. I bring my water from the same place where I load up my phone and bring water to wash myself from the river 200m away.

I used to work in retail store making 9€/h. Hard work, low cost of living build up my savings. Only used about 1500€ for the cabin alltogether. During summer got a new job as a salesman and made more money than ever and now have enough for few months since I have almost zero expenses here."
It just happened a couple of hours ago. The poor girl wasn’t read her rights or shown a warrant for her arrest. All the police officer said was computer fraud.

"I'm epileptic too. Luckily I've gotten mine controlled on medication. I've heard great things about CBD. Congrats on getting them under control and starting your own business! I absolutely see why you left your job to start a buisness. 

Epilepsy sucks. Plain and simple. You started a buisness selling something you believe in and that helped get your life back, and is helping and going to help people. I have some friends who use it for seizures and anxiety, and it works! I hope you know with every sale you're potentially helping people get their life back on track. Congrats on the business, and I hope it takes off!"
"You, sir, are a better man than I am. Thank you. "
Pretty much anything as long as the teacher has made it accessible for me to do. A lot of my teachers are like “ oh you can’t do it so just listen” and I can’t learn that way
"Pretty much (around 1.5 years old.) I don’t really think about it, like if someone says “that’s a brown dog“ I just hear “that’s a dog”"
"WOW you’re soooo funny, how do you do that?"
My symptoms first appeared in my early/mid-twenties. The major symptoms were hallucination and delusions. Just to give an example when my mother died I was laughing at the funeral because i thought it was only a ploy to get me back home. It took about a year for me to realize that she had actually died. In my everyday life I thought behind every conversation there was a hidden meaning. It was difficult to listen to music or see ads/posters because I always thought it was specifically directed towards me with some kind of code behind it. These are just some examples.

I hate that guy
Do you like your teacher?
"We've asked my mom that and she says that she just loves kids and has always wanted a big happy family (her and her brother were abused a lot as kids, so I can see why)."
Do you consider yourself lucky that you didn’t go for a bikini wax?
"Lol, it's probably because I'm a woman. ;)  Seriously, though.  I read the rest of the comments - sounds like you're a junior in high school, you work out, you have two friends and you have a job??  That seems pretty cool to me.  If you want more ""mom"" advice, let me know.  "

"Lemme guess; you're taking about the Nexus 7 right? Google said talk to Asus, Asus said talk to Google. Neither did anything and I used mine as a cutting board for a minute before smashing it to pieces. It ensured I would never buy hardware from Google again."
"When I said accessible I meant like the teacher getting the material (textbooks, power points, notes) into a format that I can read, so either braille or digital so I could read it with a screen reader. Many of my teachers just don’t care, which is really sad"
"I’ve had a couple of suicide calls involving juveniles, and a wife being mauled by the family dog and the husband finding her after work. It would be a tie between those. "
"something very scary about our lives is that if you're not a baby/woman/elder, the government will take you directly from your house without question to make you fight for them. this is why if you go outside you just see no men at all. all men are either hiding in their houses never going out or has escaped outside."
"I have an woodstove and should have enough wood to last the winter. My building skills are not that great so the cabin gets pretty cold fast. Here the temperatures drop below 0 celsius for the whole winter. I think I will survive, I just have to warm the cabin all the time."

 What sort of lessons do you find help you to understand and remember the most? (I'm a teacher) 
"I've always had lucid dreams as far back as I can remember. At least for me, I'm constantly aware that I'm dreaming, and I only exert control over dreams when they're anxiety/fear-provoking or I want to do something in the dream and I can't. For example, when I was a child, I would sometimes open doors in dreams and walk into other ones if I was being chased by people in houses. Other times, I would pause dreams and eventually some other dream would occur, but I wouldn't have control over what it was. It sounds strange when I type it out..."
what's your earliest memory?
"Hey, at least you don't have your phone as a distraction when you're learning :)"
What's your favorite smell?
"Yeah, I think so. We sort if have our in-house cliques, like some siblings being closer or having more in common than others, but we all really get along well. Whenever we do fight it's never anything physical, and it's usually over by the next day."
"Finally, I've been waiting for this answer for years!"

"i've never seen anyone getting killed right in front of me but we have lost a lot of relatives on the way and from time to time you can find some blood on the ground at some places. as the years go on you kind of forget that you're in a war in the first place and you get really stone hearted.

yes i do go to school thankfully there are some left

there are special areas where they give free bread and stuff. but you still have to find a job, and stores are everywhere although you have to be more cautious to who you're selling, it's really complicated people now judge you by which side you're on and can attack you just because of your opinion.

and well for me personally i don't hang out often i mostly just sit on the internet but hanging out outside isn't as dangerous as it was 6 years ago when the war was aflame. now it's a lot more chill

"Another user asked about it being exhausting, and I agreed with him. I think my dreams are really fun: about half of them are fantasy/science fiction and the other half are usually interesting events that could happen in real life. Each night, I usually get about 4-8 hours of sleep/night. I have delayed sleep phase syndrome (a circadian disorder), so my natural sleep cycle would be midnight-8am or 2am-10am. I've been stressed lately, so I've fallen asleep around 4am. (My cycle seems to delay a lot more under stress.) To answer your question, if I had to choose between restful sleep and no dreams or my current situation, I would rather have restful sleep and no dreams. "
"I can’t really think of much, other than Fire Fairies, hahaha. Your guys call screening is forever engrained in me though. Especially repeating the address and phone number for verification. I can tell which callers are about to lose their mind when that question is asked, lol.

Nice.
Yes
"My classmate asked me out once but I said no because I don’t really like him. Other than that, I think I have less friends because of it but I still have a few"
I’ve heard that people who are really good at lucid dreaming sometimes sleep too much to escape reality. Is it that much better or are those people probably just not happy with their daily life?
It’s like the insect version of a fire alarm. 
Meth hands down. Seems even more popular than marijuana. 
"No, the components are not cooked inside the broth."

You doing ok?
"I did. It was the most hectic experience of my life. Hundreds of calls. People yelling, command staff running everywhere, people trying to remain calm but visibly shook. It was indescribable and hard to believe it even happened. "
I wrote something a while back about a young child I would pick up when I was working as a paramedic. This little guy would have many seizures every day. His parents would give him the rectal Valium after the seizure lasted over 5 minutes. If it didn’t stop after 10 full minutes they would call EMS. We were there almost every other day. We would max him out on Ativan and or versed. Most of the time he would seize all the way to the ER. A few months ago his parents got him on high doses of CBD oil. He now has less than 2 seizures a week. Absolutely amazing. 
Yes and not really
what even is this question
"For real, I was an insomniac starting in middle school. Alcohol helped me sleep too, but I was always afraid of getting addicted. Marajuana helps me sleep now and I don't have a hangover or anxiety about how much I'm drinking just to try and get through the night."
Ask him who his favorite parent is.
"Living of savings right now, have to get a job at some point when I figure out what I want to do."
"I buy my food at the supermarket, I had dreams of living completely off the grid but have realized after the move out it would not be worth it. Not counting the occasional fish from the close by river I still rely completely on bought food."
"Yes, I'm happily married. I'm working on my mental health as I suffer from depression and I want to take care of myself more. "

"You're absolutely right. They're always extremely vivid dreams. The most exhausting nights are the ones where they could happen in real life. For example, I just had a dream two nights that I went to an EDM music festival, was in the crowd with friends, walked between stages for different DJs, then went back to the tent at night. In the ""morning"" in the dream, I was going through the photo gallery on my phone and trying to find a picture of a woman I met the night before. I became increasingly frustrated, because I searched through hundreds of photos, but I couldn't any pictures of her or us. When I woke up, I was so exhausted, not only because of my various sleep issues, but because it seemed like I had already lived a complete day. "
False. Black bear.
"Hey man, my cousin is also  a diagnosed schizophrenic and reading this makes me feel a lot of emotions. He was never able to make any kind of recovery like you and spends his time wandering around the city and going on periods of hunger strikes. 

I guess is there anything more that we can do for him? His living situation is taken care of. He’s still taken care of by his father, but everyone is getting older. I don’t want to see him on the street in 10 or 20 years, but it’s incredibly hard to keep on him on his medicine consistently. It’s like a constant pendulum swing of him getting a little better and then much, much worse.

I know you don’t have any answers, I just have a hard time talking about this with other people because I don’t want him to be judged badly. He’s the sweetest person, almost never been violent except for some of his worst episodes. 

Anything more I can do for him? We used to write letters to each other, but it ended up making him super paranoid and we were unable to continue. I feel very helpless.

Glad you’re able to push through. Fight every day."

"Well you never get lonely, that's for sure. I'm surrounded by girls, so im not the best example;

But overall it has it's pros and cons, like how it's hard to have privacy, if you are a quieter person (like me) it can be annoying when are a lot of people surrounding you all day. It's like being in a classroom of students, just at varying ages and ""going home"" from it would be shutting yourself in your room."

"I started listening to both sides of the political argument. I have always found it important discuss and think about politics or ideology logically. While initially i hated the right, and thought that all conservative ideology was completely bigoted (I was one of the people that unironically said that trump should die and that all republicans were racists) but the more I listened to the other side, and the more i researched their point of view and compared it to reliable statistics and data (ie from the FBI) the more I found the logic in the right. The reason i said I am a moderate conservative is because although i have become right leaning, I still believe that both sides of the political argument are valid and people shouldn’t be shunned for their political beliefs. I now surround myself with news/entertainment sources from both sides; while I do still read the washington post and watch CNN, I also watch debates from people like Ben Shapiro, segments from comedian Steven Crowder, pieces from Fox News and The Daily Wire."

I never wanted to get to a point where I couldn't pack up and leave if I had too, and made sure my savings never got too low.  "
"Haha I'm actually very qualified to answer this because there are different types of seizures and I've had a few of the variety.  
  
Tonic Clonic seizures, otherwise known as Grand Mal seizures are the ones where you lose consciousness and will gag, muscle contractions etc. A lot of people are familiar with these because they're shown in movies and online. I've had 5 of those in my life and they all occurred in my sleep.  
  
Answering your question about what I experience, nothing. You're not conscious. One minute everything's okay the next you wake up in the ambulance. Frightening stuff.  
  
I also have what's called a partial seizure. Epilepsy is tricky so people experience different physical effects from their seizure. Luckily my partial seizures are shorter, but during these I am conscious and it affects my hearing for about 45 seconds, but not my awareness or muscles. The CBD controlled this dramatically. "

"Lost a parent to suicide this June, and still really struggling. I’m seeing a grief counselor, and being pregnant with a toddler has kept me busy, and I guess “distracted,” but the sadness is still an everyday thing. Was there anything you did that really helped you re-engage with life? I feel like I’m surviving, not living, and I’m scared that I’ll never be able to emotionally re-invest in anything again. Does that make sense? I’m so incredibly sorry for your loss. For what it’s worth, seeing you here, after that much trauma, gives me hope that people do endure after horrific events like the loss of a loved one to suicide. Again, I’m so incredibly sorry for everything you’ve gone through. "
