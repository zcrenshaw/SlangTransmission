"I just want to second this, and thank you for saying it. Do not pander to racists OP, even when they are family. I wonder if it has even crossed your father's mind that he owes *you* an apology after abusing you just because you don't share his (evil) worldview? I bet not . . ."
"Lmao, exactly. You should have seen her face when her mom or stepdad, who had never ever played, won a round. It was so rude and cringeworthy. She also kept explaining why her cards were funny, which, I gotta say... Was so damn embarrassing. Like who even the fuck cares. I don't think she's funny, but I'm also jaded. I could never force myself to laugh at what she says knowing how she is behind closed doors. "
"Yeah when voicing this stuff you also have to think, “what do I want the outcome to be?”
An apology? Acknowledgement? Just to speak? Setting expectations and realistic ones can be helpful and therapeutic "
"Yeah, I agree that he should be making an effort. Call every third day or something. I suppose it's possible that the boyfriend is using this as a ramp up to full no-contact, but it's also possible OP expects quite a bit of communication and her boyfriend is enjoying a break from constant contact."
Does he have a history of depression?  Could it be possible something deeper is going on with him?  I think I'd give him space for now and then talk to him in person when he returns to sort out what happened and tell him how this made you feel.

With my boyfriend we're roughly the same height hes maybe 1 or 2 inches taller and with heels I'm obviously taller than he is. It's never been an issue with us I love him regardless of his height it's not something people stop and stare at you know I dont think anyone cares unless it's like a foot of a difference. If there is a connection with this guy go for it and in time you won't care about height 
"Sometimes people do start cutting contact heavily as a “precursor” to ghosting them, so maybe OP is concerned that he’s in the “process” of ghosting her. But I agree that I consider ghosting to be more “going off the radar” than this"
"Yeah, I’m having a hard time taking OP seriously because she’s calling this “ghosting.” It’s not ghosting, he’s being less proactive about texting her. And in a comment she says he told her he is just really busy, and she asked him to call her every night before bed. I definitely think her boyfriend needs to be making a bit more of an effort to compromise, but I think she may be expecting a bit too much."
"You see a ""garbage human being"" and I see someone who is ANGRY. I see someone who needs someone else to step in and let her know that it's okay to leave him, who can't let this out any other way because she has children to think about and is trying very hard to keep it together for the kids. "
"&gt;I have never really loved her I don't think. I just kinda let our relationship happen, without thinking about it too much. I let her move into my place and I let her believe I was in love with her. The truth is though, I have never been physically attracted to her

My god dude, just break up with her already and end this facade. What you have been doing for the last 3 years his so *so* shitty. Don't date her for another 2 months on top of all this. Just end it so that she can start to move on. You have been so selfish and uncaring, and you need to take a step back and look at how you live your life.

Part of the reason she is in a bad spot is because she is dating somebody for 3 years who doesn't actually care about her or want to be with her, and who fakes his love at every turn. I'm sure you think you're doing a good job, but that selfishness does bleed through no matter how hard you try, and it does take a toll on people emotionally."
The way out you say? Simple... tell her what you've told us! 
"That’s awesome that you felt those feelings! 

Just a suggestion: there’s not really any reason to point out that she is Asian multiple times. It’s sort of off putting and almost like you are sexualizing her race "
"People don't as much stare as give a quick ""damn that's a big dude"" look. As primal as it is, a lot of single men are sizing up men that are part of a couple and are physically comparing themselves. I don't even give a shit and I find myself doing it subconsciously. Even a ""refined"" man is subject to the ooga booga deep within him."
It’s completely crazy to be bothered by two people showering together. I’ve lived with roommates for 6 years and everyone did it without anyone caring. Some people are prudes or in your roommates case racist
"Talk to her about it before the situation arises again. 


My husband had to have an awkward ""sorry, but you can't crash at our place anymore"" talk with his sister. She's an absolutely terrible house guest and sometimes she'd stay at our house overnight due to bad weather or whatever. It got so bad that after the last time she stayed with us, we had to put our foot down because it just wasn't working (and trying to talk to her about her behavior was falling on deaf ears). 


So my husband talked with her and told her that in the future, she's got to find other arrangements because our place just wasn't really available to her anymore. Having the conversation before a situation arose where she'd normally stay with us allowed her time to plan and figure out what she'd do instead. "
"Right, he could wait until the baby is born and then establish paternity before putting his name on birth certificate, but it makes more sense to do it as early as possible."
"You might not have intended to in the moment but the way you write about it shows a clear desire to manipulate this boy into spending time with you, which was not cool.   
  
Most university's counseling centers are booked by at least two weeks, but definitely try and get into a meeting as soon as you can and give it another chance. Or, if you get insurance through your job/family (I know you said your parents were abusive but some people are reliant on their parents for funds so if you do use them for money/insurance), look for a counselor outside the university that takes your insurance. It's not easy but it will really help you in the end. A random acquaintance from your classes that you clearly put in a position of savior to you is not going to help you at all, and the lack of desired result might even hurt you. Help yourself, and don't put anyone in a position that they do not want to be in. "
 I think you are projecting too much with your comment. The daughter is still young and OP is acknowledging his wrongdoings and is willing to change.

100% agree with you. I want to go into this with a very level head.
"My mother was emotionally abusive growing up, and this still horrified me. Mine would tell me to ""hold my posture"" and ""suck it in"", but stopped short of ""piggy"". ""Little piggy"" is just galling. No one deserves to be spoken to that way, *especially* not by their parent. You have nothing to apologise for. 

Your mom seems to be treating you as an extension of herself, like a repository for all the things she doesn't like about herself. That's an incredibly disordered way of treating your kid. Please don't start thinking you deserve any of this -- you don't."
"“We can get you happy again.” This sounds really unethical for a therapist to say, because it sounds like a promise, and any therapist knows there’s no guarantee. I’d be curious to hear what those who work in mental health think. I’d be suspicious of anyone making promises like that. "
A lot of good comments already. I just want to add that it seems necessary that he gets away from your ex. What's happening to him right now is traumatising and he won't be able to even begin to heal and to confront all the pain and shame as long he is around your ex.
"If you do want to close the distance, I suggest you move to her city, but do not move in with her. Room with someone else. I wish I would have gone out on more *dates* with my ex before moving in with her and we were friends for a year prior to becoming a couple."
"My fiancee has an eating disorder and unhealthy relationship with food because of her parents' food-related behavior, and it was way less extreme than this."
"I think I understand.  He either knows that you're not ""the one"" for him when it comes to being life partners, or his sense of timing just doesn't match up with yours.

So if you're happy with the relationship you have, then it seems reasonable to continue to enjoy what you have, and to give him some time.  And if it's hard for you to enjoy what you have without knowing what's going to happen in the future - then move on. 

I do think that in the long run you may be happier if you have more patience.  But that's my bias, and it's also possible that by not waiting around for someone to commit, you'll be able to find the right person faster.  Sometimes quick commitments are fragile, but sometimes when you both know it's right your relationship can last forever.  There really isn't a right and a wrong answer, and you get to do what works for you.

&amp;#x200B;"
"I’ve encouraged her to go to therapy, but she hasn’t been in months.  I’m not sure what more I can do there."
"God, this is the nightmare situation I'm waiting for. I went no contact with my narcissistic mother about 4 years ago. I do not plan on rekindling any relationship with her unless she legitimately gets therapy and becomes an entirely new human. Since the likelihood of that is basically nil, I moved a thousand miles away and I'm living my life the way I want to without her toxic behavior. Sometimes I think about if I'd go to her funeral or not and I honestly would only go if my father asked me to (they're divorced after 34 years of marriage when he decided he didn't want to be abused anymore). Otherwise, I grieved the loss of our relationship years ago. And not even the relationship we had, it was the relationship we **should** have had but couldn't because she's incapable. Trust me, I don't love going through all the big milestones in my life without a mom to talk to or share things with.

I don't think you were wrong at all. I hate that our society gives shitty mothers passes, ""but she's your mooommm."" Fuck that, she was abusive and didn't deserve a relationship with you. Actions have consequences, and her actions pushed you away. The enablers will never understand, so it's probably best you distance yourself from them."
Perhaps there is no solution without changing prospects. Nobody ever said finding sexual and romantic fulfillment was easy!
"I couldn’t be bothered to read the whole thing, it’s just ridiculous. This is your fault, and you have 3 kids with her, you’re in too deep. You knew how she was before you married her, even a year or two after. No one to blame but yourself. You can’t change this now after allowing it for 9 years."
"A comment like this really isn't necessary. OP even said he wants to check if he is the father so he can be involved. It's not like he's blaming her, and she can't blame him either. "
"&gt;""would not allow that to happen""

If that's a for true quote and not just a paraphrasing of how he actually said ""oh man, that stinks, I was really hoping that this would be our first big trip together as a couple and, you know what, my PTO balance resets in August and then we can go together, so let's not go in March, let's go in August, how does that sound?"", then your boyfriend is acting like a child.

That he wasn't aware of his available PTO balance is his problem. He's 24. He should know this. Run into me in the street on any day of the year and I'll know my available time off (within 8 hours - I'm not superhuman).

&gt; I was going to go by myself *because why not*?

Indeed. Why not? You say you've gone ""back and forth"" on this. What's that back and forth been? Safety concerns? He's going to miss you? He planned on proposing? He's a controling prick? I'm guessing the latter."
"If she's suicidal or threatens it, you call the police and tell them.  You call her loved ones and you tell them. 

Never ever let someone manipulate you because all she wants is to keep you around to abuse you more.  She wants you to be as miserable or even more miserable than she is, some people are like that.

Save yourself before you start feeling so broken and dejected that suicide comes to your mind.

Bruh does she still live with her parents? lmfao maybe find someone closer to your age? 
"I agree. Knowing she was like this from Day 1, he was mad to marry her. His best bet is to get free, co parent, and find someone else for a relationship that includes sex"
"Right now he hates himself -he's not looking for healing, he's looking to get rid of something he thinks is disgusting. It may even be that he knows how abusive conversion therapy is and that appeals to him as a sort of punishment for his ""sin"". 

I'm not sure there is anything much you can do or say to convince him to go to a couselor right now. Your best bet might be to just keep repeating that you love him and that he doesn't need to hate himself.

Also - maybe go talk with a counselor yourself, someone with experience in these questions? "
"&gt; Damn, you have some rude fucking friends and family.

and how"
Why do you criticize him coming to Reddit for advice? :&lt;
"I mean, shit, even the *biology* med students do isn’t always particularly advanced. Different fields require different specializations. Anyone who claims one makes you Better than someone else is blowing smoke. 

Not great boyfriend material. "
"I wouldn’t give him exclusivity without the commitment. It sounds like he wants to keep his options open.

He probably does like you, enough that he doesn’t want you to sleep with anyone else but not enough to be in a relationship with you. Don’t cut yourself off from others until he’s sure because, you never know, you could meet someone who IS sure about you."
"Here’s the thing OP, you clearly don’t want to be in this relationship and the way I see it is that this relationship is entirely for him. You don’t appear to be getting a whole lot out of it while he gets everything he wants out of it. 
You need to ask yourself what you actually want, this is your life and you deserve to be treated respectfully and be the priority in a relationship. "
Asking the really questions here ^^^^
It sounds like he was more in love with the IDEA of having a dog than actually having one. Take this as a window into your future if you ever decided to have kids with this man. You think puppies are work? Try baby humans. Then nope your way out of this relationship.
"That pretty much summarises it. He knew what he was getting in to, and now is regretting it. He's fucked. *Well, not fucked, actually.*"
"It's a shitty expectation to have for this relationship. She has communicated her boundaries and they ought to be respected.

Apparently you two are incompatible. "
"I will absolutely not drop out of nursing school. I still do have another year. I haven’t gotten that far yet as to figure out FAFSA. But, if I’m not his dependent anymore, I would think I could still get a good amount of aid?"
"You just say no, it's not like she's going to break the door down"
"There is no other side where your GF could explain away her behavior in a normal, mature, non-manipulative, non-controlling, non-abusive, or justifiable way. 

*It’s not normal* for your partner to demand that you continuously call/text them about everything you’re doing/saying that you end up missing a bunch of stuff to be on the phone with them. That’s manipulative and controlling. 

*It’s not normal* for one partner to **forbid** the other from spending time with their friends. That’s controlling and abusive. 

*It’s not normal* for an adult, grown-ass almost 30 year old to be throwing temper tantrums like a toddler to get her way. That’s immature and manipulative. 

*It’s not normal* to use the silent treatment to punish your SO. That’s manipulative and abusive. 

*It’s not normal* to ask your partner to do something then to get pissed off at them for doing it (in your case sending her photos from your trip). That’s intentionally setting you up in a no-win situation so she can get upset with you whatever you do: either she’s pissed you didn’t do as she asked or she’s pissed because the photos remind her that you did something without her. That’s immature and abusive. 

"
"Hoo, boy. That was a long read!

Okay so, first of all, I think you keep telling your husband what DOESN'T work when it comes up, instead of having a conversation where you talk about what you DO want. What does your good relationship for him look like? What are the time frames? Like, it's totally fine to say ""hey I need you to wait to have sex while I figure a few things out, is that okay?"" but it's easier for him if you can tell him at least how long you think you'll need, and/or what sort of things would make you comfortable, and revisit it at the end of that time period (while you actively pursue the resources you need to get to where you have to be, whatever those may be.) I have to say, as someone with polyamorous experience, I'm sort of confused about your boundaries. At one point you're a package deal, at another it sounds like he's off dating his own people. Sit down and have a serious conversation about exactly what you both need and want, to the letter. You both agree that sex is off the table until they're in a serious relationship? Okay. You both agree that before a serious relationship is on the table, you want to meet her and get along with her? Fine. And it would be good for him, I think, if you could be clear on what ""getting along with her"" would look like. For instance, I don't think it's fair if you feel you have to be BEST FRIENDS with this person, or have a friendship with them even. But it's fair to say that you should be able to have coffee, build a rapport, and find her generally respectful of your relationship and boundaries, and of you too. It's super important that your husband *actively participates and agrees to all of this.* It sounds like he is looking for a good time, and you are looking for something more substantial with a metamore, and knowing exactly what you both want out of this is super important, and it's important that he feels like he owns the outcome of this discussion as much as you do. And then if something goes sideways, you can refer to your agreement and point out where it isn't working, in clear terms. I had my poly agreement written out, I don't know if that's too extra for most people, but I don't always remember details so it works for me.

I am also sorry that you were assaulted and had that experience. I hope your husband was on your side and supportive, rather than fixating on how you ""rocked the boat"" because it's a SOLID reason to not want to be friends with someone, plus the people who enable them, make excuses for them, and are shitty to you for calling out someone who does crappy things."
"Reread this post and imagine this was a friend telling you their story.

You need to stop making excuses for your husband. Srsly, if someone is surrounded by shitty people, they're usually shitty themselves. 


It's not he women you should blame, it's your husband. He's the one who can't set healthy boundaries.

Tbh, I don't see this changing if he doesn't close the relationship now and starts counseling. And yeah, you should probably also start online couple's counseling for now. This sort of topic often ends in a break up or divorce.

How much time have you actually spent/living together? Is he your first SO?"
"Yep, a totally reasonable and good decision. I tell people not to do PhDs without understanding these realities. I went into my PhD knowing all of this and chose to do it anyway, but as a result, I've been preparing myself for every possibility along the way. 
  
I'm a few months from filing my dissertation and I already have job offers on the table that I'm really excited about due to my dedication to professional development throughout my PhD studies. Meanwhile, my colleagues and friends who are graduating/recently graduated who insist on going into academia are currently unemployed or vastly underpaid for their skill sets, and frankly, miserable and anxious. And I'm in one of the top two programs in my field at one of the top universities in the world. It's completely bonkers, but it's reality. "
"Don't worry about rules for who should text and dumb stuff like that. If you like him, text him and ask if he wants to go out again. It's really that simple."
"I skimmed this admittedly, and aside from the sexual assaulter and those who defended her, of whom you are completely in the right to dislike, have you ever considered that you are a lot like many of these women you describe? You seem a bit high strung, shall we say. It also sounds like your husband has a pretty solid type and is poor at choosing partners that are comfortable with your particular arrangement. 

Going forward, it sounds like you two are going to have to change the rules a bit. You'll need more authority over whom he dates and he needs to start looking for women who are more comfortable with the arrangement you guys have going. "

"&gt; She did seem like she was making an effort to be better 

She probably was. It was hard. Dealing with things you are not okay with, is hard.

&gt; She tells me why and I just don't get it. 

Then stop trying to ""get it"" and just trust what she says about her own experience.

&gt;  She makes it difficult for me to say ""no"" to her because if I do, she lashes out.  

Which is where the dynamic becomes toxic, controlling and even a bit emotionally abusive, and is why ending the relationship should be on the table.

&gt; She has ""forbid"" me to do some things in the past - most notably talking to my other best friend. Other times she doesn't say outright that I'm not allowed to do something. But if I do it she'll get really pissy and make it obvious that she doesn't want me to do it (for example, taking classes after work or catching up with a friend) 

Which is where the dynamic becomes toxic, controlling and even a bit emotionally abusive, and is why ending the relationship should be on the table.

&amp;#x200B;

It must sound like I'm being really hard on you and giving her a pass and I'm not. It's just that you're the one here, asking this question. And the tl;dr of it is: She is being exactly who she has told you she is. Couples counselling might help with some of the shitty patterns and toxicity, but you also need to decide if you're going to keep on living with it or not."
"I still stand by reporting the theft. It’s curious he kept your social ad that can be used for a lot of financial things. I wouldn’t take him having that in his possession lightly, OP."
"The friends are probably siding with Tom because they don't want to face the fact that they're friends with a shitty person

Honestly, it doesn't sound like these ""friends"" are that close to you anyways, so I'd just write them off. Who cares what they think?"
"From an outsider’s perspective, there are SO many good reasons to break up with her.  But for some reason, you feel like you need a “good enough” reason to break up.  You don’t.  There’s no “breakup court” where someone decides objectively “yes, you’re right and she’s wrong.”  There’s also no magic wand to make HER realize it’s her fault she’s being broken up with.  No matter what you say to her, she’s going to be upset and sad.  She’s going to make excuses and false promises.  She may even call you names or try to tell you you’re not being fair to her.  But here’s the thing...none of that matters.  Her feelings are her problem.  If you don’t want to be with her anymore, then that’s enough reason to break up.  And you have to just get used to her thinking you’re the bad guy in order for this to end.  She’s not going to just go “oh, ok, I get it, have a nice life”.  But just because she’s upset does not mean you’re making the wrong choice.  Sometimes the right thing is laid the most painful one.  "
"wow. what is it like to not need any money or care about your professional reputation? your life  must me amazing if you need a stranger's personal approval more than a paycheck! these are not your friends. this is the person who pays your bills, and a stranger. as of this moment, forget everything you heard, and let them live their personal lives however they like, and do not bring it into the office, at all, ever. you know nothing. you heard nothing. it's not personal, it's business."
"I appreciate that, but he's honestly not a shitty dude. Just REALLY insecure. He has a horrific body image of himself and low self esteem, so he gravitates to the people who show the most interest, which is usually the crazies. And he doesn't have the capability to set said boundaries like you said, but I think it more comes from a place of ""oh my god someone is actually into me"" even when I go ""YOU'RE MARRIED THOUGH."" and he's like ""Yeah it's nuts. I just don't see how I'm attractive or not boring, etc."" It's pretty sad.   


Online counseling is a thing? Interesting. I'll have to take a look at that. I didn't know that.   


And we've spent about I think a year and a half to two years living together. I was engaged once for a few years, but it was a bad relationship. So sorta my first SO, yeah."
"Id have to agree and disagree at the same time. On one hand, yes, he said what he said and we can see that those words hurt OP. 

On the other hand, he didnt want to lie to OP. Women can be far more emotionally intelligent than men, so in other words, he is unaware of the effects it had on OP.
As far as he might know, he is just trying to be honest."

"&gt;  Now working on leaving porn entirely using NoFap sub

I don't see how not masturbating/viewing porn is going to make your life better in any respect. 

The problem is that your wife is rejecting you as a sexual being. That's a problem that can only be solved through counseling (if, at this point, it can be solved at all.)

Good luck."
"Relationships are about sacrifices and compromise. With all the free time he claims to have he should be able to complete his degree and have some substantive job opportunity of the poker thing falls through.

That’s not asking him to give up his dream, just be more sensible about long term prospects. I think it’s totally normal for someone to be very nervous a about the long term prospects of dating a gambler.

If OP just wants the free wheeling lifestyle of gambling and doesn’t want to compromise that in any way then they should just find other people."
"I'm so sorry you had to go through this. I've experienced something similar - my sister was abusive towards me when we were both children to the point where I have cptsd. My parents knew to some extent, and failed to protect me, but they were also suffering as she was a literal nightmare to live with.

We've since grown up and she's had a breakdown, which oddly enough made her a much more caring empathetic person. After a lot of counselling we were finally able to talk about what happened, and she apologised. There was things going on with her that I didn't know, like she had been abused by a family friend when she was very young, and she was very badly bullied at school. It doesn't excuse her behaviour, but it does go some way to explaining it.

I tried for years to talk to my parents about it. I blamed them somewhat because they were the authority figures and just let it happen. But they basically told me it was in the past and I needed to let it go. This caused a rift in my relationship with them, as I felt I couldn't be truly close to my parents if they wouldn't acknowledge such a fundamental part of my life, and their role in it.

That changed last year when my mum came to see me (I live 4 hours from them). She brought up everything herself for the first time and wouldn't let it go until we had hashed it out. She apologised, and ever since then we have been much closer. It's taken nearly 15 years, but I finally feel like I have some closure. But it wouldn't have happened had my mother not made to effort and taken the responsibility and initiative.

Good luck, sorry for the ramble. "
Is she saying that though or is she just belly aching about getting up early? I complain about early starts cos I’m not a morning person but i absolutely don’t want to be a kept woman.
"I did not say her behavior was good - it's not. But yes, calling someone stupid is worse than pointing out that calling someone stupid can be seen as abusive and worse than calling someone sensitive.  ""Screw you"" isn't kind but it doesn't involve a character judgment at all so it's not really of the same ilk."

"Just because you don't confirm to your parents idea of success does not make you a failure.

But I struggle with this too, OP. I have a generally good and close relationship with my parents but they only value mileposts of success that are very traditional. Got my Master's Degree? We're so proud of you. CPA? Oh my what a huge accomplishment!!!

I didn't face nearly what you went through in childhood but my parents have never understood how demoralizing certain aspects of my childhood were. 

Everything else in my life that I've done that's important to me, things that have made a real difference in this world, things that I'm  lauded for or communities that sing my praises: Doesn't matter.

It's always going to sting, OP. But you did what you needed to do and you have a better life now. It's not accepting that they're not proud of you so much as it is having to accept their lack of imagination of success. "

"Jesus fucking christ the comments on this are horrible, don't understand why everyone is so extreme with their response.

No their is nothing wrong with doing things like that for your girlfriend, it's a nice gesture and she simply asked you as a favour so it's not like she's demanding or anything like that.

Friends tease each other and always make jokes and unless their being aggressive or straight up rude, I doubt your friends really have ill intentions with what their saying. Don't go against your girlfriend because of what your friends said and don't become defensive and start turning on your friends either.

I understand that it probably feels embarrassing because your young because I remember getting teased etc for little things back then but honestly just laugh back or shrug it off. If you make a big deal out of it, you'll look back in a few years like ""what the fuck was I thinking"".

From reading other comments on this thread, it seems like everyones telling you to just tell your friends to fuck off which is NEVER a good thing to do when in a relationship.

Remember it's your relationship, you do whatever makes you and her happy/comfortable so if your friends tease, just have a laugh and do it back."

I mean, I love him and his body, but it's not like I'm really fainting in orgasmic delight at the merest glimpse of him, is it? Point is, I want him to feel good about himself, so I build him up not knock him down. What is it with negging? She want you to feel grateful she's fucking you or what?"
"I agree with the first sentence, but strongly disagree with the second. I do think providing her with constant reassurance has obviously not had the intended effect, and has inadvertently made the problem worse as she is now continually seeking more and more. Her insecurities are within her, and there is little than you can say or do to fix them for her. I think it’s time to have a serious discussion and to be clear with her than you are no longer going to do this dance with her, as it’s clearly not helping her state of mind or the relationship. And then stick to it! Easier said than done, I know, but I think it’s the only path forward if you are to save the relationship. Good luck! "

"Hey man! Even though there are so many reactions already, I didn't want to keep mine from you. I've been a professional poker player for 7 years, met my girlfriend 4 years in. I've ran into the same issues, the stigma around gambling is bad, putting up with the same people and the same judgements every day is difficult man. My girlfriend also enjoyed the time we could be together, not having to go to work was good, but I also quickly noticed that my professional attitude towards my poker faded. For me this made me rethink my situation, if having a girlfriend can make your focus fade, what will a ""downswing"" do when you have a family? How do you plan on focussing when you have kids waking you up right after you've pulled an all nighter for that run in a big tournament? Yeah, I decided to quit, not because my GF or her parents wanted me to, but because I simply couldn't do it anymore after questioning it myself. I can tell you, I gave my girlfriend several years to get ok with it, and even though things got better, she never got to the point where she would fully accept the situation. Partially was probably because she noticed that I wasn't at all sure about it anymore, but I guess it's also in someones nature to just want to make sure you can provide for the family.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I can't give you any relationship advice, you either think she's worth fighting for or giving up your profession for, or not. What I can tell you is that quitting poker was the second best thing I ever did in life (starting poker was the best thing). I found the same passion I had for poker in iOS development, I did some online courses and quickly found a great company that appreciated my poker history. I have challenges every day, and I need to learn new things every day, or your edge in this market will quickly decline as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whatever happens man, know that you're not alone, even though it might feel like it. People might think you're gambling, we know better. If you're capable of succeeding in online gambling, you'll probably succeed in any other market. Wish you the best!"

If this came out of nowhere, she may be focusing on weight as a control thing if there's stress at work or in her personal life. Alternatively, she may have some hangups around her weight as a proxy for her self-worth from past weight issues or bullying, so it's possible that even an insignificant amount of weight gain would make that worse. 

Have you asked her why it bothers her so much?"

"I had to stop at the ""comedy special on Netflix"" bit because I thought you were saying your sister *had a standup special on Netflix*."
"I don’t understand how anyone could think their kids would just ‘get over it’.

My bf’s dad had an affair and moved out when my bf was about 10. He said that it was all over in about 2 months and that after his dad came back no one ever spoke of it again. But when he recounted it to me he was clearly distressed. He was even expected to go ‘visit’ his dad and the other woman and he apparently hated every second of it.

This still bothered him enough to tell me, with anger and resentment in his voice, over a decade after it happened. And to this day he doesn’t connect well with his dad. Do people honestly think this shit doesn’t affect their children long term? Pushing stuff under the rug to save your marriage is all very well and good but when you have kids you can’t do that - it becomes their trauma too."
"Do not agree to do anything that she may propose at this dinner (such as praying for forgiveness, going to confession, talking to a priest, reading something she wants you to read, etc). Tell her you have made your decision as an adult, and while you respect her as a person, you do not share this value of hers. That's it, end of story. She will guilt trip you and talk about how you're tearing her apart, but you basically just have to say that you're sorry she's having a bad reaction, but this is what you think is best. She might threaten to not be in your life anymore because of this, or to not come to wedding (or some other drastic thing), and I think you should coolly respond that if she *chooses* to cut you out of her life for having sex with a man whom you love and are going to marry, then that is her choice, and you will accept it. Make her own her reaction.

At the end of the day, she's going to do everything she can to shake you from your current path. Do not give a single inch. The only hope this relationship has is for her to see that you are serious about this, and then give up on trying to bully you into changing your mind, and for her to accept your choices and stay connected with you. But really, you only have so much power right here. The best thing you can do is show her you mean business, and that if her reaction is to guilt trip you and threaten ultimatums, then you are willing to minimize her presence in your life. That is the ultimate power you wield."
"If he isn't willing to work on his trust issues specifically, then yeah I would really considering ending the relationship.

Because she is pretty much emotionally abusing you. This is not normal behavior and she is absolutely wrong. 
How are things at home with your mom otherwise? 
"Bingo.

I feel like this ‘a bad thing happened so we must never speak of it again’ is just a recipe for disaster. OP’s parents should at least have had the decency to try to talk about what happened with her in an age appropriate way, or at least have shown that they understood how she was feeling when she had the courage to bring it up. Even if they didn’t want to talk it through in any detail I feel like saying ‘we appreciate how much this affected you and we’re very sorry for this’ would have been better than becoming defensive and shutting down."
"There are absolutely people with rapid-cycling bipolar who cycle that often. That's where you get a lot of the overlap with BPD.

Your second paragraph is saying the same thing I am. There is a lot of overlap between some symptoms of BPD and Bipolar. They are different because of what triggers the changes (BPD is reaction to external stimuli, Bipolar comes from internal brain stuff.)"
"Even rapid cycling bipolar disorder doesn't cycle that much. Rapid cycling is when 4 or more episodes happen per year, and they have to be separated by full remission, or by a switch to the opposite polarity.

You probably won't change his mind even if you have all the best arguments but maybe you can help plant a seed of doubt. Abusive relationships are terribly difficult to get out of.   
Personally I would try and stop him but if you interfere you risk losing your friend, and often interfering doesn't actually help. You can also choose to support him and respect his decision. Either of these choices are okay. "

That’s a cop out. There is never going to be a “right day” to let her down easy. You need to do it the next time you two meet.
"Wow she sounds super insecure and controlling. Gonna be honest, I would not want to be on vacation worrying about that shit nor do I allow partners to dictate to me what I can do, when, or how often I have to comunicate with them. Hard pass on that relationship, you’re an adult for goodness sake."
"&gt;Asking if this can be fixed

Yes, but not by you. Only she can fix it, and even then, only if she admits it's a problem.

&gt;or if I should break up with her 

If you choose to walk away because she won't work on her issues, that's totally reasonable and you shouldn't feel bad about it.

If you decide to give it a chance, communicate with her and tell her that she needs to get help for her insecurity. If she puts in the work to talk to a therapist and get help by herself, without reminding and prodding from you, then there a chance.

If instead, she blames you, denies the problem, or endlessly postpones change while sliding back into old patterns, then she's not going to change.

It's very possible that she won't take any steps to improve herself until she's lost a few boyfriends/loved ones due to her insecurity."

I also suffered from Graves Disease (a type of autoimmune hyperthyroidism) for many years before it was resolved in the last year, and between the OCD and the GD, and all the mixed up feelings of anxiety and depression, I feel completely lost emotionally. Is there maybe an online service or someone I could talk to? One of my biggest problems is that I have no one I can confide in, hence this reddit account :("
Simply sit your roommate down and confront her with the current bill and bills from before she moved in. Let her see herselfthe money she wastes. Then ask her if she knows how the difference might come about.

"Sorry your dad is being so awful. I agree with the rest of the commenters that the ball is in his court to make a sincere apology and that it's best if you live fully independently from him in the future.

However, I'll also join some others in saying that your living situation right now is questionable. I understand that your roommate is being hypocritical about what is and is not allowed. However, she may not understand this. Furthermore, I've also been in the situation where I had girlfriends (at different times, lol) sleep over without consulting my roommates first. I assumed it would be fine, since my girlfriends would mostly be in the bedroom. However, I learned the hard way that a conversation about boundaries \*ahead of time\* is so crucial to a healthy living environment. Anything less has the potential to sink into passive aggressiveness, and suddenly you have no sense of peace in your home."
"I am 19 and I still have 2 years of college to do before I'm able to leave. There's another thing- she sometimes rolls herself on the floor and giggles randomly while listening or not to the music. Yesterday she did it when we were at the store and people thought she was fainting.
It's been like that since I was uh... 11 or something? And I don't have any aunt or uncle or anyone else, so I'm afraid I have to stay here until I can get a job."
"Curious how is he tepid?

"OP, listen carefully: you need to contact your school about on-campus housing and explain to them that you're in an emergency situation. They have resources that can help you get out, which is something you desperately need to do. I reread your post and saw that she refuses to accept the possibility that she's mentally ill and that this has been happening for upwards of 8 years. How recently did the chanting start? If she's never been medicated, her illness is likely escalating, and that's bad, bad news for you."
"Honestly, nobody cares about that. My dad, in example, has always dated taller women and his current and previous partner are also ""bigger"".

It is literally just in my head, nobody else cares in the slightest. 


I think if you let this end the relationship with a guy you seem to be really into, you are gonna regret it.










P.S.

 If you are insecure with yourself in general, never hesitate from trying to work on it. Like if you want more muscle tone or if you don't like your hair color or whatever it is you feel unhappy about...life is far too short to be unhappy with yourself"

Why do you keep rationalizing what he's doing and your complicity?  Both of you are assholes.
Not everyone only wants to talk because there's something important to say. In fact I would bet most people aren't like that. Making conversation for the sake of it just to have some contact is just as important.

Your dad is horrible.  Your dad is awful.  Your dad should be disowned.  


But..... if you need him?  Seriously consider saying ""yes sir, no sir,"" until you graduate from nursing school.  "
"did you actually use ""mansplaining"" unironically? "
"well, you can just ask him out and see what happens. 

or if you want to gauge how interested in you he is, give him a chance to make the first step. 

but if you feel like you're the one who initiates most conversations and he takes long time to reply, or doesn't reply at all than maybe not...

sorry if I sound negative. this dude sounds kind of tepid and undecided to me. "
"Oh one thing I'd like to add is that he's told his mum all this stuff about me, and now he says she doesn't trust me either, also citing the fact I can't keep eye contact with her as her confirmation I can't be trusted (I'm socially awkward and can barely maintain eye contact with most people). Like it's annoying me that he's giving his mother the impression I am a wrong'un or something. Just remembered and it's annoyed me."
"Okay, well... issue with using the N word here if neither of you is black... or if he isn't... I dunno that doesn't sit very well with me. But, not the issue you wanted discussed.

If you told him to stop, he needs to respect that. Sit him down and be straightforward- ""I hate it when you call me that. I need you to respect my wishes and stop doing that."" If he continues, I'd consider breaking up with him because if he doesn't respect it when you tell him how something bothers you, why would he respect anything else you tell him?

"Yeah it's odd. Clearly OP loves the idea of getting involved as it's already got this far, I'm guessing she loves the idea of knowing when no one else does. We all know people like that in the office..."
"It really comes down to whether you believe he's okay with it or not. As long as both people are on the same page, it really doesn't matter how often you have sex. Some couples need it at least 3 times a week, other couples need once a week, others less frequently than that. If it works for you, don't worry about it.

That being said, if your low sex drive is due to anxiety, are you taking steps to deal with that? If you WANT to have more sex, and can't, then that could be a potential issue for you personally going forward."
"Maybe, hear me out, it would be him that ruined the friendship, by cheating on his girlfriend and involving you in it for funsies.  "
"Should I also tell her details about hitting him, I wonder if that would turn her against me. He fell pretty hard and cracked his head on the ground and I honestly don't know what the extent of his injuries are.

I am worried that my friends who were there won't side with me, even with all the info. They've known him for years, and me for just a month. And it looked pretty bad, the way he fell. When that happened they basically all walked away from me and went to his side."
"Yup, this is so normal between girls who are good friends. My friends will actively offer their place to stay over if my commute is 45 minutes! "
"It's time to encourage your fiancée to start counseling. She needs to get to the root of her insecurities and start working on herself.

&gt; She mentions she fat, she needs to lose weight, she hates the way she looks, etc. multiple times a week.

If she doesn't take this seriously, it'll just get worse and worse. Body dismorphia, eating disorders etc. aren't fun.

And please make your you look after yourself. It's okay to set boundaries when it gets too much for you."
I sense a lot of contempt for the fact that you think that you are much better than him
"I think it’s definitely worth sticking around and working on it. It sounds like he’s just really excited to finally be found attractive by other women, and is enjoying that. As long as he doesn’t go beyond just enjoying the attention, it seems innocent. My bf (32) and I (21) went through something similar at the beginning of our relationship (3 years ago), but I was the problem, because I was just starting to get attention from men (I wasn’t very cute in high school!) and I was LOVING it. He told me it made him uncomfortable, and it’s been a process, but we made it through. I still like attention from other men, but I don’t seek it or encourage it anymore. "
"Firstly I didn’t read the post , I’m too smart to i already deducted what had happened. Secondly you’re not a lawyer like me so I don’t need you telling me about duress. "
"Sadly there’s really not much you can do to stop your mom or convince to get mental help if she doesn’t want to. Shes an adult and she’s the one on the lease, so it’s pretty much her house her rules. On top of that she doesn’t sound like she’s in a mentally healthy place where she can be reasoned with. 

Since you can’t move out you’re going to have to find a practical solution to reduce the noise on your end. Look for “**noise reducing earplugs**”. You can find a decent pair on Amazon for around $15. You can still hear music and people speaking with them on, but they reduce the sound level to safe pain-free levels. They’re originally intended to wear at loud concerts but they should help you out with your mom’s habit. "
"You are getting played by the boss's wife.  RUN do not walk away from this situation.  Trust me, you will go down too! "
"I'm schedueled four days on four days off, so I have time to decompress. 

It is a rewarding job though. "
"There's nothing to discuss. You can tell her that you love her and respect her, but that doesn't mean you will obey her. "
This is a good answer. Everyone is trying to do what's right for them and sometimes what's right for another person doesn't help you. Hopefully you can work your way through these feelings with your therapist. 
"That's ok, you're getting something out of their art! I guess what I'm saying is, comedy is therapeutic to an audience because the people who are able to create it TEND to be emotionally complex and conflicted. It's therapeutic for comedians too."
He’s picking fights about small immature things. Throw the whole man away. 
Personally I do not. If somebody blows hot and cold with me I cut them loose. I understand somebody not wanting to date me or be with me however when an ex who decided they wanted not to be in my life reaches out I ignore them. I have also never tried to connect with somebody I broke up with. You are 20. You have choices. You can choose to connect with somebody who does not treat you like that.
"In terms of how to deal with this, I think the first thing you need to do is find yourself some kind of support or counselling. You need someone to talk to so that you can process this. 

Secondly, you already know this but don't make any apologies to your Dad or even anything approaching an apology. You did nothing wrong here and your father was very much out of line. 

I suggest that you do some research into the JADE concept which is do not Justify, Argue, Defend or Explain. Your romantic life is your own private business and you do not owe your father or anyone else in your family anything in that regard. 

If you give in, even just to say something like ""I'm sorry you're upset but . . ."" you are making the suggestion that your father has power over you. Which he doesn't. 

I would also be very cautious about rebuilding a relationship with your father. Do you want to live your life with a man who can treat you this way? If he is capable of doing this, what is his next stunt going to be? Do you need this sort of stress and drama in your life?"

"Wholesome af, I hope she gets her lashing out sorted out in therapy and that your friendship prevails! Wishing you the best"
"Okay, that's kind of fucked up. Please consider trying to move out of there as soon as possible."
"My boyfriend is 2 inches shorter than me, so pretty much the same height. SO many benefits! Best spooning ever, and we both get to be little and big spoon, kissing and boning perfectly aligned, and I get to steal all his clothes!

I wasn't sure how I would feel about it when I first started dating him, but quickly realized it was a non-issue, then grew to love it!"
"His comment makes me think that your problem isn't the money. For example, I'm an incredibly laid back (read:lazy) type B person who tends to get really anxious around people if I feel like I'm not meeting their expectations. One of my favorite parts of my husband is that he is also incredibly laid back so I never feel like I need to be ""on"" when I'm around him or at home. 

Instead of focusing on salary why not find another highstrung type A person? I'd imagine you'd be in a happier relationship with say a highly accredited and decorated inner city free clinic doctor working for peanuts compared to a CEO making bank who mostly just lounges around. "
"it’s not that i’m trying to complain about her just to vent; it’s more providing the reasons why i want to stop being friends with her. 

i was hoping she could eventually be the one to not want anything to do with me anymore because of the lack of effort i put into the friendship. that way it wouldn’t be like i’m intentionally trying to cut her off "
It means youre each others #1 best friend for 2 weeks lol
"Thank you so much for your reply, it gives me hope. Honestly she loves doing what you suggested, but she usually strays away from those things cause they usually lead to sex or me wanting sex. Should I try to suppress that when I'm around her to make her more comfortable?
"
"Not really sure what this dinner will accomplish, except more guilt trips. The fact is that you’re moving in with your fiancé no matter what she says (I hope) and no amount of “involvement” will make her feel better about the fact that you’re sleeping with someone you’re not married to. 

If your mother loves you more than she loves her beliefs about sex and relationships, she’ll get over it. There will be tears and drama for a while, but she’ll get used to it, and after the wedding it’ll be moot anyway. Do what you’re gonna do, and don’t respond to guilt trips and tantrums (I know, I know, Catholic guilt is powerful, been there) - just do what you’re gonna do, and try to avoid dropping dead long enough for your mother to adjust. Mine did, and I have a much better relationship with her now than I did when I was young and living with her. The fact that I managed to run my own life fairly competently in spite of her objections chilled her out a *lot*. "
Anyone can be horrible when under a great deal of pressure (hopefully one learns from their mistakes) but if they're being consistently abusive then get the heck out.
"Yeah, it does sound kind of bad like that. I should add I have no fears about him getting back with his ex, which is funny because you’d think I would with how much this affects me. I understand why he stayed the night, it was late, it was raining really hard, it’s an hour drive, but idk. Waking up at 5 expecting him to be there and just seeing a text saying he wasn’t coming home was very jarring."
"You had a lucky escape.Imagine going through this when you maybe had children together. She sounds manipulative as hell,just move on. "
"Without knowing more details of the arguments or her issues with you, it’s impossible to know who is “right” - and most likely, both of you are likely in the wrong about different things. Rarely is it ever 100% one person’s fault. However, it sounds like she knows it’s over, but likely still has feelings for you, so she keeps trying to convince herself it can work out but then seeing every time that it just can’t. 

Also - it may suck, but you can’t blame her if you choose after only a year together to buy *a house* together, it’s not also in your name &amp; you didn’t put the money down, that you’re the one having to leave when the relationship ends. Yes, it does suck - but you shouldn’t have entered into that arrangement in the first place. It was a misguided decision, specifically *because* of what you’re going through now. I don’t know how anyone you know didn’t actively try to stop you from doing it. 

You two have only been together a year. You’re not engaged or married. She paid the money down, the house is only in her name. You really have no right to the house, and my guess is that if you went to civil court to be reimbursed for any renovation expenses, they’d tell you you shouldn’t have spent the money in the first place given all the other facts. "
"So she should start feeling symptoms only after 10days after unprotected sex? 

This is nerve wrecking right now.."
"&gt;  we’ve talked 

What did he say? 

You should be upfront and say you want a very sexual relationship and you'd like it to be with him, but if he's uncomfortable with this in any way, then you'll ""just be friends"" and try and find someone more on your wavelength.
"
"Yeah I was pretty upset that he decided to stay over, especially because the text was basically “I’m too tired to come home, I’m going to stay in my old room” which I think he specified so I wouldn’t think they were in her room? Idk. I knew he would be out late but like I said, I thought he would be home soon ish so I went to bed, and woke up to the text. That was what sent my mind running wild.

I don’t know what to talk about though, if he hadn’t decided to spend the night I honestly wouldn’t have even been upset, because he had told me ahead of time he was going to visit and that she and her parents would be there, so I was cool with that. But it seems unfair to say he can’t stay the night at a friends house, especially because with how heavy it rained last night it may have even been dangerous for him to drive home. Idk. What could I even say? I’m sorry, I know I must sound so helpless right now."

"Maybe, lol I think I might try the poly thing before a sex doll though. I'm not sure which is stranger to me. We do alot of things together when we're both feeling well (we have somewhat severe anxiety disorders) we play guitar, videogames go on walks, bikerides, we have 5 pets we love, and we generally just love being around eachother. I just think it's unfortunate for all that to go to waste over something like sex. That's why I'm willing to try anything. "
Of course! Just not equal financially
"Hey love, can I ask why you are still putting him before yourself, when he has demonstrated strongly that he has no trust in you? Whether he would benefit from therapy or capable of changing is not your problem. If you know this isn't how you want to live, then I don't understand why you are still invested in his well being when he has never prioritized yours. There is nothing to be recovered from this relationship, because there was never a foundation of trust in it. Leave before he escalates his behavior into further abusive behavior. He's already violated several of your boundaries by reading your messages and blaming you for his unfounded jealousy. An expectation of privacy and mutual trust are bare minimums in any healthy, functioning relationship, which you do not have with your BF. 

&amp;#x200B;"
"You're an adult. Find reasons to be out of the house during most of the day. Job school friends whatever. Plan on spending a few hours home with him each day. Other than that, make plans, or make up plans. "
What’s different is she’s very stressed about the possibility of being pregnant. 
I’d be inclined to see where things go with the girl who is closer to you. It sounds as though the long distance one has a plan for the rest of life that may not exactly mesh with yours geographically speaking. 
The most telling part of this post is when you say you don't care if she's 18. I seriously thought you were going to elaborate by saying that if she is in HS then you know you have to end it because she is lying to you AND that you know you shouldn't be dating a high schooler. Then you went in the opposite direction and I have no idea what to tell you other than you need to get your head on straight.
I don't mean to be harsh but if you are not asexual I REALLY don't see that ever working out for you guys in the future. I'm sorry :/
It's unreasonable and selfish to have sexual desire in a committed relationship?
"It sounds like you work well together as household managers and parents. How old is your daughter? Is your wife in love with you?

If this is a marriage that works logistically, but lacks passion, there could be options besides divorce, like opening the marriage (but only if both of you are on board).

If you divorce, what are your goals? Do you want a serious, long-term relationship with another woman, and if so, will you be able to find the time to create that? You say work takes the majority of your time, and becoming a single parent will add a few more responsibilities to your plate, so it's important to be realistic about what life post-divorce would look like. "
"Polyamory or lots of masterbation with materbation aids? I think your options are limited if your partner doesnt want sex...obviously then you will be the only one fulfilling your sexual needs....unless you are ok with opening your relationship. 

Is it just sexually you are unsatisfied? Is affection ok? "
"My thoughts were the same because she tends to overreact and stress could help her do it. 

But she is very curtain about it and I believe her because she wouldn't joke about it."
screw college. Get out asap. She could really go wacko at any time.
Following because I am same just opposite role.
"&gt;I saw someone who needed love, and I did my best.

No one asked you to fix her. Women aren't projects."
"Yeah that is so true. I definitely didn't even think of that. When I look back at the friendship, it definitely appears to be that way. The only friends she has left are really toxic and bad people and influences. It makes sense now. "
"Your edit does not really change the fact that you words are shallow and that's how you're coming off no matter what. People can smell bullshit when they see it.  I believe you have some unhealthy views on women and put them on a pedestal.  Look up madonna/whore complex.  You need to break this habit of objectifying women. Do you have any female friends?

&gt; But this is the best age for her. If she gets older, in a sense she will be less “competitive” in the “marriage market”. 

You've used some really fucked up logic to say that you're doing her a favor, but you're really just creating a lie for your future and hurting 2 people in the long run.  Women do not have an expiration date.

&amp;#x200B;"
"It’s a bit concerning that your boyfriend also has a little bit of a controlling personality?

Are there other options- flatshares off campus with mature students/young professionals?

I’m glad you love your dad and still have some enjoyment, but if his escalation doesn’t end, I hope you find some options to give you more freedom"
But what else could it be? Every symptom leads to pregnancy
"Pull an ultimatum. Lying is unacceptable in any relationship, it doesn’t matter how small. For your sake, she better be legal and that is why you need to cut this nonsense and find out. You should be annoyed by this, not worried if she’ll be annoyed. "

"it doesn't seem she was off the clock since she was at work when the wife encountered her and they both took off to a bar.

also yes, even your activities reflect on your whole being for employers. i mean...are we really going to argue about that.

also op is not some innocent bystander. she is ACTIVELY pursuing her ""listening sessions"" with her own BOSS' ex wife. you want to keep your job? you tend to please higher ups and not scheme with people they dislike or get them in trouble.

and even simple listening can come back to bite you since people will associate you with the blabbermouths and THINK you are participating. and thinking that is enough to earn a reputation.

that's why the office world in particular is such a hard place to navigate.

i was well aware of the word i picked and i put it in brackets. however i stand by it; when you are employed, you have a contrat with your employer that you wont actually harm him in the process. op wants her paycheck? then yes she should definitely be loyal to her employer. do you think a banking employee who wants to keep their job will run their mouth about confidential stuff to a rival company?"
"what he did was seriously fucked up, i wouldnt give him another chance"
In addition to not loving you--because love is an action as well as a feeling and he is not behaving as though he loves you--he's also an emotionally and verbally abusive gaslighter. 
"Loyal is a weird word.
She has no obligation to either off the clock on her own. She can listen to anything she wants.

Talking is a different story."
"&gt; so we decided to get a house (in her name b/c the money for the down payment was from her grandmother) together. We spent the next 2 month fixing it up together and it really became a home to both of us.

Check the law in your state. In many areas, she needs to first give you 30 days notice since you've been living there for X days and are a resident."
But how long has it been? A week? Ten days? Three weeks?
"Everyone’s already provided advice here, so I’ll I’m going to say is thank you for punching him. I hope he has the sense to restrain himself next time he’s at a bar because of you"
Yeah he sounds messed up and not cool at all. Definitely has some things to work out before diving into social relationships! Bye bye!
I know it's stupid. We weren't thinking..
"&gt; Some examples of her reactions: - ignoring the fact that I got pregnant - when we had conversations, always talking about herself - calling a pregnancy "" discusting"" - talking about the frequency of miscarriages - telling my how she hated how pregnant women ""showed off their belly"" of "" shoved their bellies in her face "" - telling how she didn't like being around pregnant women ( but telling this to me? ) - .... 

Your friend needs to stop trying to get pregnant and get some counseling. Her miscarriages are no excuse for being such a crappy friend. Yes, she's suffering, but instead of lashing out, she should work on herself.

You simply need to take a step back from this friendship. If she asks why you're no longer meeting up, tell her that you need to focus on yourself right now."
"What the actual fuck? Parenthood is a million times more stressful. Ask him if he wants to watch her take her problems out on his kids for 18 years? Because she will. They and he can never stand up to the fantasy in her mind. Every time they annoy her, she’ll yell. What will she do if they disobey? She’s gotten physical with him. They’ll have to grow up in a house where mom constantly berating dad. 

All this sounds like code for “if I give her kids like she really wants or whatever it is this week, maybe she’ll behave” She’s an emotional terrorist, and you do not negotiate with terrorists. 

I think you should talk to him again. Maybe write a letter. Do beware of her. She might come gunning for you if you succeed—we all know she will."

"I'm not sure you can get rid of her without being rude. But you can try a couple things: 

1) being direct. ""Hey, Kim? These text messages are a real downer. I'm trying to keep more positive energy in my life. Let's keep it positive, okay?"" or ""Hey, here's what I need from my friends: [explain what you DO want]. Are you able to do that? Because if not, we're going to have to go our separate ways.""  

2) white lie about your busy life. Something like ""Hey, listen, I'm not going to be able to text or hang out for the foreseeable future. Things got a little crazy in my personal life and I need some time. Thanks for understanding."" and then basically just ghost her. 

3) nuclear option: totally ghost her, block her, and don't answer any more texts. Yeah, it's hurtful, but if she doesn't respond to 1 and 2 you may have to go that route. "

Love this. I went back to your original post and read through because I also have a sister with BPD and needed to read this. 
Vague idea. I know we haven’t truly discussed it though. I’m just afraid he won’t believe me

"Have you sent him information about Borderline Personality Disorder? You could ask him if the key symptoms apply to his finance?

He may be chasing the initial 'high' of idealization from before she began the bad behaviour and showing him that this won't return could shock him out of his situation"
"Nah, your relationship is over.  She wants to go be with this married dude and had repeatedly chosen him over you.

Your therapist sounds full of shit frankly.

Your jealousy didn't push her away if your account of things is accurate.  In starting an emotional affair with a married man (whose wife is super naive), she pulled herself away from you.

To hell with the ""break"" which, without conditions, is always code for ""I need time to fuck other people and then come back to you, so make sure you're available for me when I'm done.""  Break up for real and go no-contact.  I know, it'll be hard.  But it'll be easier than what you're going through right now, and what you'll go through if you decide to go with this ""break."""
She knows these symptoms but they started way too early. On her ovulation cycle or right after I can't remember precicly
"Yeah, that tells you all you need to know. You can love him without enabling his clinginess. "
We were honestly using condoms it was just this month that we were so reckless
"You said staying in the relationship was enabling him, but so is leaving the relationship.

Leaving would likely mean he would go back into the drugs, continue to drink, become more lonely and more depressed, have masses of extra time to drink, have to stay living where he is now, which means an hour and half drive to work after driving excessively the night before. 

Staying would mean I can at least try to help him, suggest hobbies we can do together, I'll do the food shop so he eats healthy and we have less booze in, he will have good company which is one of the major things main things that helps recovering alcoholics.

'Enabling someone' works in all regards. Anything you do could be considered enabling. You have to look for the best possible solution, not just abandon the problem and think that's the lesser evil than trying to help.

"
"I think you should speak to him about the abuse and howl you feel about his friend. No one is a mind reader and anyone who is dating another person, SHOULD be understanding to what makes them uncomfortable. 

My current GF (25F) was in a very physically and emotionally abusive relationship for 6 year. So she is very withdrawn from me at times and very jealous of other female friends I have, so I have to be very understanding with her. 

Once you BF knows what's going on, you have opened the door fully to him and he then has to decide to walk forward. Since you are saying you are a year deep, that means he sees a future with you. So try voicing yourself to him."
"stop worrying about upsetting her.

Your job is life is not to make sure that no one gets hurt/upset/etc. (obviously Buddhist would disagree). Your job is to be reasonable and fair. If people still get upset, that is on them.

So, just tell her that you can't be that type of friend for her anymore."
"I will be honest I remember wishing for the day he would pass as a teen. He was controlling to an unimaginable degree. Now it terrifies me. As much as I am all he has family wise, it is vice versa. And you telling me about your father killing himself makes me feel terrified. 

I know it's not my responsibility but I'm not sure I could live with myself...

Thank you for your kind words "

My mom has some addiction problems right now and the legal agreement is that i can't stay with her as a minor. She's doing rehab now. I will be 18 at the end of the coming summer and at that point I can do whatever I want to in terms of where I can live. I want to make money at camp this summer (that's part of why I really need this job) and then get a place with my mom.

Ask your friends to spread the burden.

&gt;Lately I've been skipping a few of these events because I just want my own space, and that feels shit. A few times we've not told jess about us going out to avoid it too but that also feels shit.

Don't do this to people you don't hate. You consider Jess to be a good friend. Speak the fuck up and don't be a shit friend because you can't use your grown up words."
This was my thinking depending on OP’s relationship with the boss. Affair with someone below you in a company could cause a lot of problems (why do they often involve HR? Stupid Pam)

"""We are in a relationship. Part of making a relationship work is communication. You arent comminicating with me here and it is putting a strain on our relationship. I need you to talk to me. Im here for you. Please tell me what happened. I dont want you to feel trapped with me, so if this is relates to anything that may effect this relationship itll be best if you just come out and tell me instead of letting it eat you from the inside.""
If she still persists on not telling you. Move on shes not ready for a relationship. It may be cheating but it also maybe depression.

If she does tell you, be ready for anything. DO NOT yell. DO NOT let yourself get angry at her. There is a possibility for betrayal, However always remember that being hostile to her wont solve anything. If by chance it is an infidelity problem. Dont take it as 100% face value. If they said they just flirted assume they sexted. If she said she went on a date, assume they fucked. Youre trying to get her to be honest with you, but that doesnt mean you have to stay with her if you find out the truth."

Without a moment's thought you've accepted it as gospel and for some bizarre reason you're actually considering doing what's been asked of you by this **stranger** that could potentially **destroy** the company you work for.

What the hell is wrong with you? Seriously. 

This whole post exposes a major and ugly character flaw in you, that you're so desperate to be a limelight in a real drama you'd jeopardize not only your own job, but potentially your career and the jobs of multiple other people. You must be the office gossip, and your boss has told his wife in the past that he has to be really tight lipped around you because you can't keep a secret for 30 seconds. 

THIS is why she sought you out specifically by name to share this ""news"" with, because she knew that you would be the one most likely to gleefully get involved and babble all this out, so she can look innocent and all fallout about the news getting out will hit you and not her.

If I were you I'd take this as a huge shock to the face that you're the office gossip and get your shit together. 

And don't tell anyone this stuff, good grief."
"As many have said, he needs to come to this realisation himself.

What I think you can do, before he marries her, is to get him 1-on-1 and go through all of your concerns. Write everything out before you do it so you have a (mental) list of your legitimate worries, and back them up with examples, e.g. she's emotionally abusive, she falsely accused you of xyz and is gaslighting you when she says abc.

List every single thing out and ask him: 'if I was dating someone like this, what would you say?'

Also ask him if he thinks she'll be a good parent. And ask him if she's like this now, how bad will she be when they're legally together, merge their finances, and have kids so that she knows it's much more difficult for him to escape her abuse.

If he still insists on staying in this relationship, strongly suggest pre-marital couples counselling so she can take active steps to actually change (which is what he even said himself). She most definitely won't agree to it, but it's his prerogative to stay in a relationship with someone who refuses actual help to get better.

Tell him that you will be there for him when she (inevitably) drains him and will do what you can to help him out of it."
"&gt;On the plus side, most Indian families wouldn't force their kids to drop out of school, especially medical school. If they find out they may threaten you a lot but, if you call their bluff, they probably won't do it.

I'm not an expert on Indian families, but this is a good point. They really have nothing to gain from following through on that type of threat because (1) it would reduce their own social standing, (2) it wouldn't necessarily make OP stop dating K, and perhaps most importantly (3) once it's done, they would have no leverage left over OP to make sure she toes the line in other areas (she might decide she wants to go to a different type of grad school, or date a white guy, etc.). 

If they're irrational enough to follow through on threats to cut her off financially, I think that lying would be the best solution. "

I understand how you're feeling. My weight has gone up a touch and now I'm less than 15 pounds from my SO's weight, and it bothers me for some reason. But, you and I both need to understand that our insecurities are just projections of fake ideals. I do want to lose some weight for myself, but not because of how we look as a couple.

"&gt; I need to convey to them that I am a strong girl who knows what I want and that they are wrong regarding salaries/doctor/etc. 

I may not be S.E. Asian myself, but I’ve had enough first-generation friends to know that this ain’t how it works. 

Chances are, your parents won’t be on board with this no matter what you say. You’re their child until you’re married, and children don’t get to run their own lives. This is a better-to-beg-forgiveness situation. If you want to openly date this guy, do it, and brace for parental meltdowns. If you don’t want meltdowns, your options are 1. Don’t date him, and 2. Don’t tell them. 

For what it’s worth, I have a Punjabi friend who married a white guy (BIG no-no for her), and her parents didn’t come around until she had a ring on her finger. At that point, they had to decide what was more important - staying in their daughter’s life, or ruining their relationship over a foregone decision. They opted for the former. I hope your parents can do the same. "
"Take your husband up on the offer of you getting solo counselling. Use this as an opportunity to sort out your thoughts on your relationship and the possibility of divorce, and to maybe address some of the abuse that you suffered as a child.

Most likely, I think it sounds like your relationship is headed for a divorce. But getting some solo counselling to wade through your feelings would not be a bad idea."
Stay out of their situation as much as you can.  It's completely inappropriate what he is doing and it will end badly.
"It’s not the size of your dick that matters, it’s what you do with it.

You need to understand that just because you’re gf has been with guys who may have bigger dicks than you, it doesn’t mean that you are somehow inferior in any way. You’re gf has told you that she likes your penis - why do you think she is lying to you? I think she’s telling you the truth. She likes your dick, she enjoys the sex you have together and, most importantly, she’s with you. I can tell you from experience that what matters in a relationship is not genital size. It doesn’t define you and I hope you can work through this because it can only make you feel better in the long run.

It’s easier said than done I know so good luck."
"Hoping someone will change when they've stated plainly they don't plan to change, don't see a reason to change, and don't believe they ought to change is irrational.

"it’s a really different place in life, especially if he has a career and a degree etc etc etc "
"It’s one thing to need a break from a rigid/structured life, but he’s being super reckless &amp; immature by exposing himself to potential diseases &amp; excusing it as “ski culture”. That’s ridiculous. I’d personally break up with him for no other reason than wanting to open myself up to diseases. "
"There is no 'letting down easy."" Break ups are hard. The kindest thing to do is make a clean break with as short a conversation as possible. Do not explain or justify beyond ""this is not working, I am not happy and am breaking up with you."" 

She will probably ask, beg even, for reasons, but that will only be and opening for her to bargain. Don't do that. 

Break up, disentangle yourself from any financial obligations - rent? etc - and then go on your way. Don't hang out or meet up or anything else, at least for a while.  You guys are not compatible and don't bring out the best in each other. "
Stay the fuck out of this
"I mean now it doesn't look that different, but we also don't know how long they dated for and how long they have been married. Op only mentions she was in the middle of getting her associate and he had just finished his major.

14 year old kids can be...emotional, to say the least. In a few years she will laugh and say ""remember when I freaked out about  my 15th birthday when my eye was messed up and you tried to cheer me up?"" and it will be a great story. 

I love how you want to make her feel better, that's so incredibly sweet!

If she normally has a funny sense of humor, get an eye patch and glue some glitter, draw a silly eye with glitter pens, something fun like that and give it to her. Get two and wear one yourself! GET A BUNCH AND EVERYONE CAN DECORATE AND WEAR THEM AT THE PARTY!"
"You're acting like she's a consolation prize. You're cheating on her, you're disrespecting her. You don't get to decide what would overwhelm her when you're being dishonest. You're not her keeper, you're supposed to be her partner. "
"It's not good for kids to be raised around a bad example of what love is. That will be more damaging that being a kid with divorced parents. 

You can be a good dad without being married to her mom. Get 50/50 custody. Live in the same area so she can have her friends and school and activities the same. Work hard to have an equitable split with her mom - how that looks depends on a lot of variables.  It will be hard and there will of course be bumps and anger and hurt but that's a part of life.

My marriage ended in a drastic and wretched way and I spent a year crying, and my kids saw that. But they also saw me become so much stronger, and do things I never realized I could. We really struggled financially and that was the part that brings me the greatest sadness, but other than that, it was really the best thing that could have happened to me. I've overhead my girls talking about how proud they are of me of rebuilding our lives, and that is such a great feeling. 

The things that have led to them not having a great relationship with their dad (so you can avoid!) was him moving very far away, complaining to them about paying child support, letting his girlfriend be pretty mean to them, not calling or texting them very much and then calling to yell at them about being ungrateful brats. It does not sound like you'll do these things and in fact want the best for your daughter. 

There is a very good chance that you and your wife can grow to be better people from this. "
Saying breaking up is out of the question isn’t going to help anyone come up with a magical solution. Breaking up is necessary sometimes. Not that you can’t make this work. 
"&gt; Some small part of me hopes we can salvage this but I know we can't. How can I get over this? I feel there is no way I can. 

Because there isn't. You are probably still in shock, and your emotions haven't caught up with your head yet, but you know its over. There's no coming back from this - frankly I'm surprised you tried to forgive her in the first place. The fact that she continues to abuse your trust is all the proof you need that it's over. 

Talk to a lawyer and a therapist, both ASAP. And get tested.  Very sorry you are going through it. "
"This was a setup. Plain and simple; either you were too drunk to remember that you participated in a threesome, or you were drugged and passed out. Either way, it's bad. 

Get a divorce lawyer. Protect your rights. Move on. "
"You’re too kind, thanks again!"
"If you clearly said you were not interested in threesomes then this is insane!! If my husband did this to me i would leave him. I could never again trust some one who planned, staged and went through with sexually assaulting me and cheating on me. Then being thrilled about it after.

She didnt use protection? So she also opened up you two to the risk of desease? And now she doesnt want u to go to abortion with her??? This is insane!!! I think you are putting yourself at grave risk trusting her again."
"Yes I can safely say for sure I enjoyed myself and I guess he knows, if not I wouldn't have returned the kiss. I am actually interested in him but I feel like I am getting mixed signals from him because his replies don't seem as enthusiastic as they were in the past. "
"&gt; She is mostly upset because I have hidden the fact that I have been sleeping with my fiancé from her

God, I can't imagine why you felt the need to do that. She's approaching it in such a level headed manner. /s

&amp;#x200B;

(Seriously though, not sure if you're looking for advice or just validation, but your planned response sounds like exactly the right one. Don't expect her to take it well, but know it's ultimately the best thing for both of you.) 

&amp;#x200B;"
Have some fucking self-respect and get a divorce you idiot.
Yeah that's straight up cheating. You threw your red flags that were justified out there and she just straight stonewalled you. That's not how you treat a spouse you respect and whom you care about a relationship with. She's making herself pretty for another man. Start the divorce. 
"Thank you for your reply! That’s a good question, I’m hoping in time she’ll come around and want to plan the wedding with me, but if not I guess she’ll miss out on it. Ultimately its her choice"
"Imagine if things were turned around and it was you who had gotten your wife drunk due to your desire to have a threesome. Sounds pretty terrible, doesn't it? You didn't consent. She was aware you didn't want to do this. I don't think there's much left to salvage here. This is just not something that happens in a healthy relationship.

Also, her refusal to meet your demands and conditions for getting an abortion is telling. If she truly felt like she'd done wrong, she'd do what you asked. You agreed to work things out if she met those conditions, and she didn't. "
"Ugh, sorry bro, that sounds incredibly horrible, and that's an understatement. 

There's not going to be a quick fix to feeling better about this situation. However, if it were I, I know I wouldn't be able to focus on anything at all, and if that's you as well, I'd seriously look into taking some vacation days off at work, and getting out of your environment. It's good to get away, and truly have a retreat, one where you're able to put this all together. 

It's also important to give yourself time and distance, this way you'd avoid any emotionally charged interactions or decisions that may not be to your best interest. 

Only you know your relationship, so rely on that knowledge. 

Best of luck, op. "
"Your wife cheated on you with your ""friend"". She planned all of this in advance. 

What do you want to do from there?  "
"Thank you for all the advice and input!! This was excellent and really helpful. Essentially yes I need to be firm and hold my ground. I have a really supportive fiancé and his family, as well as my aunt and her family. Hopefully she’ll come around and accept this but if not, I won’t be able to have a close relationship with her"
"If you've already have that discussion, then there's not much else you can do. How long do you have left on the lease? Can you and BF afford to move into a new place?"
Are you fat? Or maybe he thinks you’re unattractive 
"Good advice, thank you!"
"I feel like in this case, they actively involved her in it when she was a child, causing her to have anxiety to the point of having panic attacks. You don't get to do the thing that's just ""best for you"" when there is a small child involved."
Adults know that sometimes love is not enough. You're acting like a child.
"Smoking in the bathroom isn't always a solution. My bathroom smells so heavily of weed every night from the neighbors. The smell occasionally leaks out into the bedroom or living room.

"You’re not seeing all of this for what it is because you’re desperate for it to not be the reality. If one of your friends described all of this to you, you’d be telling them to get the hell out, immediately. If this was a month or so in, I could maybe understand. It’s been a *year*. You’re accepting more than anyone should, and he is using you imo. I’m sure he genuinely likes &amp; cares about you, but he does not feel about you like you feel about him, and he’s prioritizing everyone else’s feelings above yours. 

You’re young, stop being a placeholder &amp; find you someone who wants everyone to see your car parked outside their house because they’re fucking *proud* for others to know you’re there. His behavior isn’t because you’re not enough to warrant better - this guy just isn’t the one capable of giving it to *you*, and there will be plenty of others you will love just as much &amp; more than you do him right now, and you’ll look back &amp; realize this relationship wasn’t anything like how you thought it was at the time. &amp; you’ll be so glad you didn’t waste any more of this short life on it.

"Camomile tea compress work really well. Don't know if they work better then just a hot rag, I've just always been a tea drinker hand had bags to spare. Make the tea put the bag on the eye, drink the tea. Repeat every 2 hours or so. The tea really helps with the itching. "
"Thank you for sharing. What you said about showing the same kindness to myself as others really resonated with me. I definitely don’t do that, I tend to build those around me up- but somehow only seem to be able to put myself down. Will be more mindful of that in the future. 

I think even in the original post I didn’t need to use the word “fat” it is what I am (which quite a few of the responses seemed to focus on!) but I would never use it to describe someone else I’d be more kind in the phrasing- that’s just a small example. Thanks again!"
Do not put makeup anywhere near a stye.  It can inflame it worse and slows the draining and healing.  Keep the area clean use a warm compress (washcloth or even a tea bag) for 10-15 minutes at a time to promote draining and healing.

Emotional incest was my first thought reading the Op and her responses. He hasn't pursued relationships with  adult women because in his mind Op has filled that role since she was a child. 
"It's 2019, you should ask him out. Maybe since he was the last one to respond, he might have been afraid you weren't interested and didn't want to get rejected if he asked for a second date. "
"I was waiting for the ""Is this a cultural difference"" question, but nope, just three separate references to her race for no explicable reason. Made worst by his other descriptors of her being ""nerdy"" (all asians are smart stereotype) and ""very shy"" (asian women are submissive stereotype).  "

"This is not your business. Do not gossip about this or tell anyone. If she or your boss tell other people, then that's on them,  but you need to protect your career and not do anything that could cause someone to want retribution against you. Don't spend time worrying about whether it's going to ""destroy"" your boss because ultimately, he is the one who made the stupid decision to start an affair with someone at work. I don't care if it was only an emotional affair or not, it's still dumb, and he's the one who is going to have to deal with the consequences. "
"there is a solid chance you have a better read on things than I, but, I would be more inclined to agree with you if the guy had a guest room, or she was sleeping on the couch, but in his bed?

"Coming from a Christian background, there's often such a weird convoluted way of looking at relationships. There's no dating stage in the Bible (because men just picked a teenage girl to marry and agreed terms with their father), so you're expected to just meet someone, date them (but not live with or sleep with them), and then get married.

And once you're married, *literally immediately* switch to sleeping with this person and living with them. It's a stupid dichotomy that definitely leads to more divorces than necessary. There's no room to gradually grow your relationship in those two important aspects, it's insane.

And make no mistake, the end goal *is* to get married, and certainly to have kids! You'd be a 'disappointment' to her if you didn't.

I don't know what it'll take to change people, thankfully I think it's getting better generationally. Sorry I don't really have any advice!"
"I appreciate your honesty. If you don't mind me asking, I'm a bit confused about parts of your comment. Do you think that poly alone is an unhealthy way of having or maintaining a relationship? For what it's worth, there's no ""competing"" in our relationship, I guess it may seem that way if somebody isn't familiar with poly? I'm also not too concerned with it eliciting ""bizarre reactions"" in other people -- anyone involved was also poly. So I'm a tad confused. Unless perhaps the other person thought there was some form of competition, but my husband and I are happily married, so there's no.. How to say it, spot there? It's kind of a hierarchy. Sort of like how that one woman we were dating briefly also had a husband. We knew where we stood in each of those relationships and we know it's not at the top with the other husband/wife. I'm not sure how else to word that. But I would like some more clarification, 'cause I do think you hit some right points there that I may be doing without thinking.  


And on some of those notes, you are probably right. I may have had some predisposed thoughts on some of these women. A few I did quite like in the beginning though, but those ended up being the ones who vehemently defended the assaulter. Maybe I didn't give the others a fair chance, though. It is fair."

I don't know what she's going to ask but I think you should be very careful about agreeing to anything.   I think you should just let your mom be upset for now and continue your plans to move out.   She may be upset for the short term, which could last weeks / months, but she'll eventually get over it.  In the meantime you can just keep reassuring her that you love her and that you feel you are doing the right thing."
"I don't know how old you are, but if you are of age, I think this is a sign for you to move out."
Reread your entire post. Why keep referring to her ethnicity? That _is_ weird. 
"&gt;Since she’s pretty crushed she didn’t get it, I didn’t want to pile on

Don't.    She already knows that you were right and she was wrong.  It sounds like you want to say ""I told you so"" out loud but it won't accomplish anything.   As long as she is doing her best to fix the problem, there's not much more that can come from the discussion.   She can't go back in time and fix this."
"I would be lying if it didn't feel like a huge betrayal. My ex did terrible things behind my back and my dad watched me cry and agonize for weeks once I discovered the extent of his deception. He was sympathetic and called the guy every name in the book. Then a few weeks after we broke up he ambushed me with the interrogation about my sex life. Infact he made me confess. He told me that if I didn't take a polygraph he would kick me out. Finally I just said it and he was smug. It bothered me how he seemed so sure, so I looked to see when his last text to my ex was (my ex had been harassing me at work to get back together and my dad swore he hadn't spoken to him). 

Lo and behold he had texted him to meet up the same night he ambushed me about my sex life. 

It just goes to show how selfish he can be about his own ideals I guess. He'd rather be a traitor and talk to my ex and disrespect me just to find out what he wanted to know. "
He’s distracted by something or someone. 
"Do you have friends and family you could speak to? Or even someone you trust but aren’t that close to?

A therapist is going to help, I’m sorry. This is not mental illness, it’s mental illness AND abuse. He isn’t abusing you because of his GAD, so even if his GAD got better, he wouldn’t stop.

"
"when does he get back?

&amp;#x200B;"
"Hello OP,

&amp;nbsp;

I’m actually surprised no one has suggested what I’m about to say, but, he sounds like a narcissist. Might want to check out r/raisedbynarcissists .

&amp;nbsp;

Now for the tough part.
He’s punishing you, and essentially trying to force you to do what he wants by willfully, and ILLEGALLY taking possessions and items of yours that are necessary for your success/educational progress.

This is classic narcissistic abuse, especially given what you’ve described about him controlling your mother’s finances.

&amp;nbsp;

As for your friend, I would seriously reconsider your friendship with that person considering they told their mother to tell your father. 
&amp;nbsp;
Given how small your town is, I’m sure she knew to some degree how your father would react. While it’s nice that she helped you get her purse back, that doesn’t change the fact that she’s a traitor who decided to get your racist subside father involved rather Jan communicate LIKE AN ADULT.

&amp;nbsp;

You have two choices in this situation and NEITHER of them are pretty.

1. Lie to him (and possibly convincingly to your room mate) that you broke up with your boyfriend, so that you can get your social security card back and other items. Your father is holding your documents hostage, until you do what he wants, THAT IS ABUSE. 

&amp;nbsp;

2. Threaten to get the police involved if he doesn’t return said items. Depending on how “toxic” he is, he will either
A. Destroy your stuff and deny returning it (also illegal)
B. Refuse to return your stuff forcing you to take him to court
C. Badmouth you to everyone you know in your town
D. All of the above and then some.

&amp;nbsp;

It’s up to you what you choose to do, I don’t know your father or which path is “the path of least resistance and stress.

&amp;nbsp;

Alternatively, establishing a criminal record of your fathe/ behavior could potentially help you someday, and possibly your mother because, AGAIN, your father is ABUSIVE. Normal healthy people DO NOT hold documents and vital items hostage with their child or someone they are related to do something they don’t like. 

&amp;nbsp;

Please be careful OP, and best of luck."
"If I was sadistic I wouldn't be posting here. I was trying to do my best. I saw someone who needed love, and I did my best. If you asked her, she'd without a shred of doubt say the last 3 years were the best in her life."
Why do you think you should hang out with her all together? Why can't you go do stuff with her by yourself?
"Unfortunately, you're being used by the sounds. Either you're already a side chick, or he's trying to find a main chick. These red flags are genuine. Assuming he's not genuinely poor, he should be going out of his way to get you something at least thoughtful as gifts for holidays that people generally care about. Hiding someone is never good. There are very specific circumstances where it is understandable, but this doesn't seem to be one. 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, I think you're being nice by saying ""he's not a bad guy"". He sounds like he's low key a piece of shit and you haven't yet been witness to the full medley of viscous feces he will drip over your life."
"It's more like my boyfriend is in law enforcement and frequents the local student housing for calls and sees a lot of shit. The city isn't fantastic. I would feel the same way about anyone I care about living on campus, it can be bad news. I definitely don't find him to be controlling, he's a good man. 

There not much in the way of housing. Just three tall towers with 8 people to a suite. Like I said it's a party school so this scares me for my academia...


I'll be honest I am very happy with my current boyfriend. I've suffered some abuse and deception in a few previous relationships and I recognize what a rare find he is. Were perfect together but we just haven't been together long enough yet in my opinion to move in together. But he's searching for his first house to buy and constantly brings me along to look with him. He always says that once he buys the house and moves in, he hopes I'll join him. I don't know where that would leave me and my dad but it is likely something that will happen in the next 6-8 months. "
"Her sexual attraction is irrelevant, she's not a good partner if she has no interest in working towards fulfilling your sexual needs. 

I considered myself asexual for a long time, my husband could've written this post a few years ago. But I recognized that I was going to destroy our marriage if I continued being selfish. There's no reason she can't put as much effort into the bedroom as you do besides selfishness. She should want to make you feel loved and desired. 

The moment I realized I was hurting our marriage was browsing /r/deadbedrooms. I had never experienced needing sexual fulfilment, so I just didn't understand to what extent it was necessary for my husband. I was so heartbroken over what I had been unintentionally doing to him, I apologized profusely and made it my mission to prioritize his sexual needs. 

It's been about a year since then and our bedroom is on fire. I recently started feeling sexual attraction for the first time. As confusing as that is for me (why now? I've identified as asexual for years) I'm very happy about it. And now I feel the need for sexual intimacy and it makes me feel so bad for what I did to him early in our marriage 

In short, she has to realize what she's doing to you if she doesn't, and if she already does then she's not being a good wife.

"
Disagree that what?  That men like when women have many men chasing them?
"Are you insecure because you just are by nature, or did it start cropping up over the course of the relationship?"
"There is no ""letting him down easy."" You reap what you sow and his field sounds like a disaster. "
"&gt; What do I do?

Start taking your own freedom. 

Your wife’s job isn’t stealing your PTO. Your wife’s friendships don’t detract from yours. Your wife’s vacations don’t prevent you from planning vacations. None of the things that enrich her life are taking anything away from you. If you hate your job, look for one with more time off. If your friends don’t plan stuff, start taking the initiative. If you don’t like your friends all that much, go out and meet new people. Take charge of your own free time. Use this jealous feeling as a warning sign that you’re unhappy with your *own* choices and that it’s time to make different ones. 

"
You should bring this up in therapy let them know this is your breaking point and you won't get married under these conditions.
All these comments are so complicated.  You don't need to text her.  Texting should just be used to arrange to meet.  This is because in person interactions create much more powerful emotions than text conversations.
"What is he really supposed to do about it? He went no contact with several family members, threatened them with restraining orders, and only talks to a couple others still. He also has ignored his friends of 20+ years since they last treated me like crap several months ago.


But it still feels shitty that none of them treated his exs this way. No one caused drama until I came into the picture."
Should I just keep trying to be cool with her? How do I handle this situation I’m already a very anxious person 
"There's no such thing as ""cheerleading events"" around here. i just go to the home games for the soccer team from her school"
"And if they're not like this initially they become like this later. My siblings and several family members are doctors. Pre-med students are the fucking worse, btw."
Thank you &lt;3 I will check that subreddit out thanks for pointing me that way! I had no idea so many people had a mother like mine.
"I don’t think it’s too late. She was punishing him for being shitty but she still cares and wants his love. 

When she completely stops trying or asking for attention, it’s too late. 

She needs you, OP. 

Keep reaching out to her. Write her a letter.  Take her to dinner 1:1. Make time for her and hear her out. Teens have big emotions so steel yourself to go over the same thing again and again. You need to reprogram how she thinks of you. That means you can’t freak out if she keeps punishing you or if she cries when you talk about your connection. 

You should also ask her what she would like from you. She has already said she needs more verbalization (saying that you love her and are proud of her, etc.). She probably needs more hugs. She also needs to know you’re a safe place to land. If she’s upset, can she come to you. Right now, that’s a big no. Aim to be her safe space. Listen to her. You can fix this. "
"I'm living this same situation. I decided to stay with my wayward husband on the condition that he cut off all contact with the other woman. His story was almost word for word what you wrote there. 

This was a bit over 4 months ago, and I still don't know if staying was the right move. I can tell you though it doesn't get better over night. It's going to take lots of work and sacrifice, it doesn't seem fair that you could be so betrayed and still be the one putting in effort to salvage the relationship, but that is the price of reconciling.

The pain from heartbreak will get more manageable. You'll start being able to eat and sleep normally again in a few months. There's going to be a lot of talking about why. And there should be. Do not let her guilt you into ""just getting over it"" This sin't something to just get over. You've got to clean the wound before you try to bandage it or it will fester and rot. 

If she will agree to go to personal counseling, that could help. Couples counseling tends to unfairly place blame on the betrayed spouse. It was not your fault she cheated. 

Decide if it is worth it to you to try and salvage the marriage, because you'll be mourning the death of the relationship either way. Reconciling is the hard path, but I'm told from others who have walked it before me, a stronger marriage lies at the end. 

(It's okay to try and understand why she did it, and work on the issues that lead her into another mans arms, but it is not okay to let her blame you for her choices. It is not your fault she betrayed you instead of coming to you to talk. )"
"Life is hard when you’re a teen and even more when your parents aren’t supportive and critical. I’d ask your grandparents how they feel about you staying. I do not think you should apologize, however do you feel if you go back you’ll be on eggshells? I’d suggest you and your mom both go to therapy, separately and together. I don’t want your mom trying to control the situation there. So if need be please write things down so you don’t forget important points of why you’re there. "
"Do they know why this is an issue? If they don't, tell them. If they do, tell them that you find that hurtful considering your processing issues and give them a better alternative to use. And if they continue then you firmly remind them that you find that hurtful and would rather they did the other thing you asked them to do. "
"Last year I brought a flat on my own, even though I'd been eith my other half multiple years before. She couldn't afford to be on the mortgage so I took the plunge.
We split all the bills (council tax, food, gas etc etc) and I covered my mortgage as well as the half of the bills. We both felt like it was fair so that's how it was. "
I'm not sure about splitting costs yet.  I don't even know who he is.
"Oof. Fuck. I’m so sorry for what you went through. I could barely get through reading that. Honestly, I feel like you’re intro to your history with you mother should have been your eulogy to her if you did shown up. Otherwise, fuck what people want to believe and what they want to hear about someone they enabled and valued over your basic health and well-being "
"This has obviously been bothering her for a while. I want to give you a cautionary tale, OP- my dad treated and still treats me the way you do with your daughter, and we have an absolutely terrible relationship. I seriously recommend you take a good hard look at how you treat your daughter. If you want a positive relationship with her as she grows up into adulthood then you need to enact some serious changes and demonstrate not just with words but with solid actions that things will be different for the better.

Otherwise, your relationship will end up like mine with my dad- and let me tell you, I don't like him very much. At all, really. If I never saw him again that would be okay with me."

"I have a friend who is going through the same thing, and she is also very close to breaking things off. But she mentioned that she was considering just living a part for a while, so they still would be together but not live together.

I feel like this could work for her, of course it could be different in your situation, since my friend and her boyfriend aren’t as serious as you guys. 

But honestly I think that moving away would only solve the problem temporary until the old habits return. It’s hard to say. "
"I work in the industry, and sometimes your supervisor is an asshole. It just happens. Try not to take it personally. In your role, effort and a decent level of competence is all that is expected, and it seems like you brought more than that to the table. Some people in the industry are unsatisfied with their lives and like to beat up on the junior employees, sometimes because they had somebody who was mean to them and they feel like that's part of the job, as dumb as that is....they went through hell, so now other people have to as well. Lame.

If other people were happy with the job you were doing and you felt like you were completing your tasks well, then don't let their crappy attitude get you down. I think your negative experience was more about their attitude problem than about you being a bad employee. I hope your next supervisor is better, and if you are open to taking direction and criticism, and asking for advice, you'll be okay."
"Sounds like you need professional help and have some real attachment issues. You should tell your wife about all off these encounters. If you want to be a good partner, that means owning up to your mistakes and facing the consequences. You shouldn't even suggest an open relationship at this point divorce might be the best option for you. "
"If this is a consistent thing, I think you need to better consider yourself as the problem and make a better effort on what you can control--the volume of your voice.

If others are rude about how they address it, that is not something you have control over. It seems like you are trying to turn this issue around on others, however, and that you don't want to take full responsibility for having a rude habit that others are regularly trying to address."
"I had this same thing at 21 (23 now) with a guy I was with for 5 years. I’d come home late at night after an 11 hour shift and he’d expect me to cook his dinner even though he’d been at home all day. All bills in my name (he’d pay half but I had all responsibility). I loved him but he was so dependent on me and I don’t think either of us realised it. He split with me because he decided he didn’t want children which at the time was painful, but ultimately it was the best thing ever for me. I had a new found freedom and independence as my time was all for me. I would rather be single and happy than in a relationship but miserable. And the best thing is, I’m now with someone incredible who I feel is truly my equal. I hope you can find the right solution for your situation!"

Thanks for your input! "
It means she’s a moron 
"Yes OP, no one should ever hit you like this! You are worthy of respect and deserve better than to be treated this way!"
"Being in a relationship with someone is not about rationalizing why it makes sense. They either spark your attention and you love their personality, or you don’t. If you’re not super into her as a person, let it go."
"Well I’m being honest about the mistakes I made about not knowing sometimes where something is or not being as fast as they would like, but I was on time with the gps. Like I said I’m kinda standoffish and shy. Some people on set like the producers said I was pretty, but I typically don’t like that kind of attention."
"This doesn't sound like polyamory. I have a lot of poly friends and have been slightly involved with the community in the past. This sounds like long term untreated mental illness. The *constant* need to be with multiple people, developing emotional feelings for a significant portion of women you come accross, and not being able to say no to keeping in touch with past flames are all separate and distinct from polyamory. Poly people can be single. Poly people don't develop feelings for an inordinate amount of people. Poly people are capable of severing ties. 

You really need to sit down with a mental health professional, probably at some point with your wife. It will be hard for her to hear, but she deserves to know what she's up against here and decide freely if it's a situation she even wants to be a part of. "
"Ok, then I'm not doing it anymore. Which is fine, it is what it is. But to me the bigger issue is her insistence that I HAVE to keep doing it as if it were a regular job"
"First instance, he was being a dick. Second instance, I can see how it could be interpreted as a joke if he shared the screenshots with people in his line of work. I work in IT and I'm always complaining to my colleagues of the trivial things I have to deal with at work. Most issues are self-explanatory to people who deal with the same situation on a daily basis, but it's not so obvious to others who don't come from that background. I don't think this is dump-worthy, more of a discussion you two should have about him respecting your line of work. 

The thing is, every field has their strengths and weaknesses. Whether you work in law enforcement, medicine, teaching, art, write, whatever it is -- if you're passionate about a field and you dedicate yourself to learning it, the end result is that you're going to know more than the usual person about that field. You can't look down on yourself or put others on a pedestal just because you think their work is more important and yours isn't, or vice versa. All fields of work exist for a reason. For example, your doctor boyfriend can perform CPR and do math, but can he think clearly about the next course of action when he has a gun pointed at his face? Does he have the balls to make a national security decision that will have ramifications for hundreds of millions of people? Probably not, and alot of us do not either. We like to imagine we're better than others, but at the end of the day, we are in the field we're in for a reason, that's what makes the ability for us to choose our own career paths so unique. "
"The shelters in my state are overflowing with GS, Husky and pitt mixes for this exact reason :( Not everyone is equipped to handle intelligent, active large breeds. "
"&gt;All of that being said, what she's doing is 1000% not okay. Staying over at a new (male) friend's house, hanging out every day and getting shitfaced and trying to keep you from coming. You have a big heart to heart about things and she doesn't care about it. She just wants to party.

oh no.. before we dated she dated/got with a lot of guys..."
"Seems you like did the right things, fuck creeps. You don't owe the people you blocked an explanation. Tell your friends why of you wish. But don't bother with the blocked, if they don't apologise for what they've done, they don't deserve your time.

"
"You owe your mother nothing. You owe your family nothing. (. . Sounds like you might have others in your family to add to the no contact list.) If you want (totally up to you), copy and paste this list above on all the physical and verbal abuse to your family members on why you did not show up to the funeral. 

I'm so so sorry you never had the kind of mother you should have had. I'm so sorry you went through all of that awfulness. You deserved/deserve better. "
"I agree with you, it does sounds a bit like she wants to say ""I told you so"". But trying to be an optimist I think she more wants to be sure her wife takes it as a learning experiance. ""Dont put all your eggs in one basket"" sort of thing. Just my opinion though. "
everyone here has some good advice about working on the relationship... and I would also suggest seeing if she needs therapy.. maybe you can both go to therapy together because your response to her was indeed shocking. There is some kind of deeper issue that I feel only professional help would fix. 
"You did nothing wrong. Please remember that.

Unfortunately, I think with how your mom acts, you’ll have to prepare for the possibility that she is going to justify her actions as “just parenting.” She may say it’s just how she does things. She’s already said things were different for her, and maybe she had a moment of clarity but sometimes that’s not enough. She might buckle down twice as hard on what she says and it’s going to suck really bad. People like her aren’t likely to change.

If possible, I’d say stay with your grandparents since they don’t seem like they’re breathing down your neck about food. Surround yourself with people who love you."

"You did nothing wrong. Absolutely nothing.  No matter your current weight you are allowed to have and \*enjoy\* food, even unhealthy food.  Your mother is being abusive contstantly criticizing you for most of what you do, and shaming you for eating or not exercising to the level she prescribes is abusive.  You are not wrong.  Your mother is wrong.  If you want to move back home, your Mother will likely expect an apology, but you don't really have anything to be truly sorry for. You had a human reaction to inhumane treatment.  Don't be sorry for that. If you were mean, or abusive - that's something to be sorry for. But having negative feelings, and showing them is not something you ever need to be sorry for. 

  

Are you able to book an appointment with a doctor, or a social worker?  Doctor so you can hear what your current state of health is, and so they can go over what sort of meal or calorie planning you should be having (and it shouldn't be starving all day long!) and a social worker so you can work through how your mothers disordered eating has affected you, and how you can overcome it.  I'm sorry you've had to endure this, and I know someday you will make it past this and be at peace with yourself and the way your body is meant to be.  "
If she’s been exaggerating about stuff to her family how do you know she’s not making up the whole dying wish thing too? Seems a bit strange to me that a man on his death bed would be concerned about such things...just my opinion though.
"I'm not sure where you're getting that we think OP is an incompetent dog owner. It's clear she's capable of caring for this dog. The question is whether she wants to do it alone — and that issue is directly related to the boyfriend sucking.  Because nothing she says is going to make her boyfriend not suck, so either she stays with him and raises the dog alone, leaves him and raises the dog alone, or rehomes the dog. And the tone of OP's post very much suggests that raising a GSD puppy alone is not what she thought she was getting into and not a prospect she's terribly excited about. "
"Rude question here, are you still married to her mother? Rude comment: my guess is no. You need family counseling to repair this. Speaking as a grown woman with an emotionally absent father: you have done permanent damage to your relationship with her. Now it's your responsibility to make sure you didn't do permanent damage TO her. Also: it is 100% the responsibility of parents (yes, even fathers) to show their love for their children. You failed this young woman and she seriously owes you nothing more than you've given her. If I were her I wouldn't even bring you dinner anymore. How on earth would you care so little about her feelings to say all those things? You purposely hurt her. You seriously need help."

Kic k him to the curb
"Dave needs therapy from a professional, not free from his wife who's dealing with her own feelings about this. Maybe this is just true for him, maybe it's a side effect of a health issue that came on more recently, or maybe it's something else entirely. Either way, believe him, don't have sex with him at least until he's not a puddle of sadness and you believe he can meaningfully consent - not out of guilt. He needs a pro, and you need space to process this before you make any decisions. "
I also think if he wasn't this way previously that medical issues could be at play here too. See a therapist and a doctor to figure out the scope of everything because it does affect both of you.

"Two choices.

1. Nothing. Everything remains the same forever.

2. Make a move, declare interest. EITHER the best thing you ever did, happy ever after, OR you lose your best friend.

Do you feel lucky, punk?"

Nope.  You did nothing wrong.  Your mother was dead to you years ago.  

I'm sorry your family is being difficult.  "
"Thank you for getting my head straightened out! You guys are totally right. I just need to hear it, I guess! "
"Yeah, you don’t have to keep doing it. "

My man kinda completely stopped doing all of this shit but I had to go through all of that and tell someone what basic decorum is. I would recommend OP to not make the same mistake

"Please get yourself into therapy.  I have a feeling your issues go much deeper than you think.  

&gt;  I'm having an insomnia episode (totally unrelated) 

Really, dude?  You just crushed your daughter and now you can't sleep at night.  You sure that's unrelated?

You're badly out of touch with your emotions. You've been out of touch with your poor daughter's emotions for 16 years. And when she finally mustered up her courage to talk to you, *beg* you in fact to open up, you reacted with anger and defensiveness.  In spite of the fact that I believe you love your daughter. Because *that's* how invested you are in keeping all of your emotions stuffed down.   


I don't think you will ever really repair things with her until you work on what is going on inside yourself.  "
"I'd show him how much you love and care about him in gestures if you think you will struggle to do so with words (I personally always cry in situations like this).

Put on his favourite movie and surprise him.with his favourite snacks. Plan a cute, distracting, low intensity date that you would both enjoy like mini golf or something. 

Let him know that if he wants to talk, you're there"
"Don’t start the precedent of him telling you he won’t ALLOW you to do things. That’s not how adult relationships work.  We all set boundries on what we expect from our partner like no cheating etc...but we don’t tell our partner they are not ALLOWED to go somewhere without a valid reason and discussion. 

He can FEEL like he would PREFER you don’t go without him, but he can’t DEMAND that you not go.

He’s not giving you any valid reasons not to go, if you really want to go then go, if you can reschedule to a time you both can go then do that.  

Tell him to use his grownup words and articulate his feelings, but you won’t have him telling what he will allow when it comes to your vacation. "
"A few questions-

Will his wife be mum about the fact that he had an affair with you?

Does she know who you are?

Every relationship is a risk (not a question, but really.. it's true)

Is he willing to do some counseling and assess the issues he had that led him to have an affair instead of communicating his needs/wants, or seeking therapy or divorce before getting into a relationship with you?"
He needs to read Ask a Manager for tips on resume &amp; cover letter writing. She's got a whole book on this. Writing a resume is not easy if you don't have experience with it. She gives great advice that is very practical. 
"All I've told her is about my highschool escapades. How I cheated on one of my girlfriends in high school, how I used to harass women, and was the literal definition of a ""fuckboy"". 

However, I haven't cheated on anyone since I was 17. I would always end the relationship when the thoughts got out of control. I no longer harass women. I now do fully understand that people are people and not things to be used. Other commenters have suggested that I still think of women as objects. That is not true, I realize this behavior is fucked up and want it to change. It's not as simple as me having them as ""notches in the bedpost"".

I've always had the theory that it had to do with not getting attention as a child, specifically from my mother. I didn't learn a lot about women growing up because I was with my dad 12 days in a row, and then with my mom for 2 who would just leave me in my room playing video games unless I needed food or something. I was literally raised by a PS2 as far as my mom is concerned. Yes, she took care of me, but didn't interact with me very much. "

"Our lives are very similar. My father died 4 years after the last time I spoke to him. He was abusive and toxic and I do not regret my decision to cut him out. The backlash I got after he passed was enormous. Family members I had never even met were leaving voicemails at my house, random fb messages, I even got a letter to tell me what a horrible, ungrateful girl I must have been to not even go to her own father's funeral. I was 19 and handling the death of my father in my own way. The man beat me, he scared me, I did not want to be near him, and I wasn't really sad that he was dead. It's been nearly two years now and now the family that shunned me is trying to reconnect, to check in, even though for two years they offered me no condolences, no support. But they showed me who they really were, I'm not interested in being around people like that. And I don't think that you should be either, 

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, death is deeply personal, and at the end of the day, she was your mom. You're going to process this your own way. For me, the most upsetting part was that I deserved a good father, and I would never have that.

&amp;#x200B;

And because I've been in your position, I will say to you the thing that nobody said to me, the thing that I wanted and needed to hear. I am sorry for your loss. My inbox is always open."
"Conversion therapy is almost torture, give your son money for some actual counseling but don't give him money for this kind of treatment "
"I don't know where in the other comment I mentioned my mood. I said that if I, over time, had developed the attitude she wants and deserves, none of what she complains about would have happened, but I wouldn't act that way."
That's a find a new therapist kind of reply.
"I mean, not a good thing for him to say from your point of view, but honestly this just sounds like your BF was just venting to his friend about his ex and it got a bit petty. Like, yeah, it sounds like he still has baggage and issues from that relationship, and that's something to keep tabs on in terms of your relationship getting more serious, but it doesn't look like he actually wants to sleep with her or to be with her, or that he doesn't want to be with you. If this is the most damning thing you found, and I assume you dug deep into his looking for something to confirm your insecurity, then I would rank what you found pretty mild in terms of your BF being honest and trustworthy. "
Then she needs to share the debt too and there needs to be an equal distribution of labor. Maybe she doesn't pick up a second job but she better be busting her ass around the house or picking up the slack in some other area. Why should he be expected to bust his butt if this is an equal partnership
"Absolutely do NOT appologize. 

Your mother is mentally abusing you. Stay with your grandparents. Eating healthy and exercising is important, but to eat healthy you have to EAT. She is pushing you into eating disorders, and that is NOT ok. You are 15 years old. You are going through body changes that are perfectly NORMAL. You did not embarrass your family, she did. If I were your waitress I would've felt so badly for you and probably snuck you some bread or something. I have for others in your situation before. Your mom needs counseling."
"When you talk to her, ask why she decided to say this now?  I suspect she's been talking to someone who has made some sort of comment about ""going Dutch"" and reinforced this skewed vision of a relationship.

There is no way that she has any business thinking that spending on her should be more important than clothing yourself...or anything else you want to do with your money. 
"
"So there are a lot of problems here:

* he refuses to make any temporary changes to your division of labor to accommodate an injury
* he fails to hold up his own end of the agreement 
* he calls you a lazy princess for...being injured
* instead of being grateful that you can take a big chunk of time out of the middle of your day to care for the dog, he holds this against you 

Imagine all of these traits, but if you had a kid instead of a dog. You can't keep up with the kid because you hurt your knee? You're lazy. You want him to do occasional night feedings? You're a princess. You ever want to renegotiate an agreement? Well you can't, because all household labor agreements are set in stone forever. Oh, except he doesn't actually have to uphold them, and if you ask him to, that's nagging. 

Your boyfriend sucks."
"Dump him, block him on everything, and get therapy. "
"Not true. Science doesn't back this, unless it's a serial cheater. "
Actually you are tight and I am wrong. Good points
"I love that analogy, so helpful"
"It's entirely the opposite. You don't owe here any extra time.

Trying to work through problems is something you do when you've been together for years, own a house together, have kids, etc. If major problems arise immediately in a relationship, don't even bother trying to fix them, just walk away. "
"When I was 16, my dad was really high up in his church and had to attend meetings there like 5 nights out of 7. I had an after-school job and was very active with a bunch of extracurriculars at school. We rarely saw each other. I remember one time, I was driving to work and he was driving to church and we passed each other on the street and stopped to ""talk"" from the cars. ""Hey, you doin' okay?"" ""Yep, you?"" ""Yep, see ya later."" (And does it even matter who said what to whom?) 

Before that little incident, before he'd had this time-sucking church calling, when my older sister still lived with us, he spent hours and hours teaching her how to drive, including stick shift lessons. By the time my turn to learn to drive came around, he was ultra busy with church and I never really had a lesson with him. He and my stepmonster would just hand me the keys and tell me to drive, occasionally screaming at me when I screwed up, but never really giving guidance in the first place. Imagine my humiliation when I failed my driver's test the first time. I renewed my learner permit and continued not getting instructions. Finally, the second permit was about to expire and dad asked me when I planned to go take the test. ""I'm waiting for your driving lesson. You spent hours and hours in the car with \[Sister\], but you've never had time to spend any with me."" So he took me out and gave me a quick course and I passed my test that time. Because I *needed* the attention and I was old enough to *know* I needed it. However, that one incident does not make up for all the hours and hours (adding up to years) that he spent being busy with other shit, including my siblings. (I'm the youngest.) 

What I'm getting at is the effects of this kind of seemingly benign neglect on girls later on down the road. To this day, I am not married. (I'm middle aged now.) The reason for that is every guy I would fall for and had a serious relationship with basically treated me like I did not matter. My needs, my desires, my goals, my feelings were never or rarely taken into account. My input into decisions was usually ignored. I've had to repeat myself 3-4 times before my partner ever actually heard what I said to him. And I keep repeating this pattern over and over. Took me quite a while to finally figure out that the reason for this was I had become very comfortable with just quietly meeting my own needs. I learned that I do not deserve help and that nobody can be bothered to help me, so I never ask for help, even when I know I need it. Note, I never asked my dad to sit with me in the car, he initiated that conversation. I was surprised he'd even taken interest. So I'm used to being dismissed in relationships. And I'm not about to marry that. I don't want to live the rest of my life being ignored and dismissed just because I was raised that way and it feels normal to me now. So I'm still single. 

You might want to think about that for a while. What do you think the long term results are going to be? What kind of relationships with men do you think your daughter is going to feel comfortable in? 

I don't think you really need to hear from us what you need to do to fix your relationship with your daughter. I think you already know. You give her the same time and attention you'd give to anyone else in your family. Or more, if you're accustomed to treating everyone like you don't really have time for their shit right now. 

TBH, I'm a little tearful reading this because of the flashback to when I was 16. Don't let your daughter become a single 50-year-old, okay? "
"I don't understand how people are so upset over your post because I'm 100% with you..

I shower everyday and personally wouldn't want to be intimate with someone whose hygiene isn't great..

Showering takes like 15-20 minutes and I have super long hair so I don,t get what's the problem..

Maybe instead of telling her, you should try to compliment her when she's fresh and smells good"
"Is this your GF's first serious relationship? I ask, because this is another red flag, but it's also a fairly common immature/inexperience thing. Like, it's one thing for your GF to want you and to want to spend her life with you (to feel that way), but actually competing and trying to have you ""all for herself"" aren't healthy for you or for her at all."
"Seriously... shouldn't a couples' therapist be able to say, ""look, you two are obviously miserable together and it's a ton of work to make you halfway happy as a couple. You'd *clearly* be happier apart""? There are plenty of pairings which are never, *ever* going to work out, no matter how much therapy is involved. Some people are just all wrong for each other, and nothing short of personality transplants would change that. I'd think a couples' therapist would see a higher percentage of *them* than one would in a snapshot representing all relationships, good and bad, within the entire populace."
"Let them be upset and pitch a fucking fit. All that tells you is that they're supporting a fucking child abuser. These aren't people you want in your life at all. Tell them that the abuse you suffered at the hands of your mother will never be okay with you, and that you don't need to justify that to them. Then they can either apologise to you, or you can cut them off fully until they do. They are poison."
Good suggestion. I'll do my research on that. Perhaps he'll be more willing to listen to a different opinion if it comes from a religious authority.
"Yeah, because of my rookie mistake about the dating apps thing, I am scared to even assume right now let alone use those words. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am really hoping he will have the same answer. If you don't mind me asking, how did you ask him?"
"Yes this sounds like a classic emotional affair, Sven without seeing the content of her messages with him. Please I know you call it a ""no-brainer"" to stay with her but she's being really shady and deserving of mistrust here. Without trust there is no relationship and right now I wouldn't be able to trust her at all if I were you.

I might have given her the benefit of the doubt if she stopped after the first time you said something or after he told her he had feelings for her. However, at the very least, it sounds like she enjoys the attention and I'm pretty suspect that she does have feelings for him that she's denying to you and (maybe) to herself.

I don't think you should continue on with someone who's feelings for another man are so strong she can't even get herself to stop talking to him, even though it's damaging her relationship."
"Sometimes women who crave that much attention grow out of needing all that male attention, other times they don't...

Your wife may eventually grow out of it, but she is 21 and her actions don't appear to be saying that she is anywhere near growing out of it. 

If I were dating someone who had a past filled with craving male attention, I would be a bit more hesitant..."
"He should have been, yeah... 

Too bad for everyone that none of us can go back in time. "
"WOW. Your family just doesn't get it. I swear, we have the same mother. I had to cut off contact when I moved away to college because it got physically/verbally abusive and just plain toxic. She started sending me long letters with Bible verses about honoring your parents in the mail, showing up at my house... asking me for money when she knew I was completely financially independent attending uni. I would sometimes respond to her emails (since I had blocked her number) because I felt so guilty, and she is getting older, and sometimes I still do. But I just can't allow such a toxic presence back in my life when I am struggling as it is.. YOUR mental health always has to come first. I amso sorry for your family's lack of understanding."
"well, more ""blank, blank"", but yes."
"Damn, that is pretty messed up dude."
[removed]
"&gt;  I haven't been particularly in touch with her lately,

It wasn't a ""momentary"" incident; your reaction and follow-up was completely consistent with how you've been treating her for quite a while. You've been pretty much checked out of her life since she stopped being a little girl you decided it was too much effort to relate to her as an adolescent (which definitely takes more work but you *did* sign up for parenthood).

&gt;so I told her if she wanted cuddles maybe she should just go to her mom and to leave me work in peace.

What was that about?  Are you resentful of her relationship with her mom?  If so, why?   You seem dismissive of her involvement with her cheerleading crowd too.  It sounds as though you have been in denial about your own feelings here and have taken the easy way out by just withdrawing.   

You need to do some serious repair work.  You've already apologized, now *live* like a dad who is serious about improving your relationship with your daughter.

"
"Dude...

I was a teen girl not so long ago. My dad doesn't have much interest in 'girly things' as he puts it, but you bet that he knew all my friends. You don't even seem to know who she hangs out with?

She no doubt has interests. likes and dislikes. Music, movies, maybe video games. She does things with her cheerleading team. She's not a mega-super spy hiding her stuff. It's all right there. You just don't open your damn eyes."
"What happened anyway, @OP? "
"Damn, you have some rude fucking friends and family.

I'd start making these interactions as awkward as possible. Next time someone asks when you're getting married, try looking at them with a blank expression and replying, ""You must be so embarrassed you just said that,"" and then changing the subject. Put it back on them. Make it weird."
"Agreed. My parents split early on. When I asked my dad about it as an adult, he said:

“If love was all it took, your mother and I would still be together.”"
"Totally agree. What ""productive"" can come from addressing this? Plus, she knows already. I agree this will just come across as ""I told you so"" which doesn't help anyone"
[removed]
Yeah but what have you suggested to her that is not gaming-centric? It sounds like these are all things you enjoy. What about things SHE enjoys? Suggest doing something like that with her.
"I can see it both ways. It is your money, but the way you talk about it here does sound extremely selfish. 

My husband and I have separate accounts and take care of different responsibilities (and have drastically different incomes), but we still discuss financial decisions jointly. He spends as he sees fit and so do I, but when we have an extra influx of funds (for instance, he gets a bonus at work), we talk about it. I've never said he shouldn't spend on something he wanted, nor has he told me that - but we act and feel like partners in regards to money. Your wife is probably not feeling much like a partner considering how you are expressing yourself here. 

I'll also agree with others that I'm happy we maintain somewhat separate finances while still working toward mutual goals. "
"You are definitely not alone! My mother also did so much of the same things your mom did. My earliest childhood memory is of her trying to drown me. She has never apologized for that or even acknowledged that she was in the wrong.

Thankfully, I've cut off all contact with her while maintaining a strong relationship with my brother. Like you, I have found a family with my boyfriend (and his family) and I feel so happy and safe. You have a right to feel these things as well! Once you experience what a family is supposed to act like (loving, supportive, caring, fun) you never want to go back to the abuse. So I understand why you didn't go to her funeral. Why the hell would you if you have already created a family that makes you happy. 
"
"Hmm. So you've already broken the ""all money is communal"" system. Sounds like the two of you need to re-negotiate how you combine and/or separate money.

We have 3 accounts: one each for fun persona money and one joint for household expenses and joint activities (eating out, holidays etc)"
Thanks for the explanation. I hope you find a solution to your problem. 
She sounds needy and insecure. Don't chase her.
"He needs to live on his own first. This is a really important ""adulthood"" step that I promise you will regret if you don't do it. You will wind up with all the mental and financial load of running a household and he will never get why you're annoyed. "
ughhh im sorry :( but he sounds like an ass. He could have been using u for sex or maybe he wanted to make sure he made the right decision by ending it ? either way take a pass girl. whatever he's doing it's not for ur benefit.  he's obviously taking care of his own needs right now. if he said he fell out of love then that's all u needed to know. time to move on. 
"This is actually super fucking normal. 17-20 year olds usually go a couple of years up the ladder, due to liking older guys. Remember in middle school, high school, pretty much all the girls would go for someone who was finished with the school, so a middle schooler would date a high schooler, a high schooler would date someone at a university or at work."
"Why would your debt be personal, but your earning be shared?  I would discuss with your wife that she was comfortable with finances not being completely shared when you were taking out a loan, so it bothers you that she wants to change that approach now, and see what she says.  Hopefully you can get on the same page about both positive *and* negative finances - personally I think it should be the same approach to both, regardless of if it's ""mine/yours"", ""mine/yours/ours"" or ""ours""."
"Was the loan for the benefit of both of you, or just for you personally?

TBH I'm with your wife here. You have a ""all shared"" financial agreement, thus this extra is shared too. "
"You should be more concerned with your wife's drinking problem.

Honestly, she sounds like she needs counseling for her low self esteem/depression/addiction or whatever is going on here.

You have right to tell her that she is crossing boundaries you aren't comfortable with and this is not what you want your marriage to look like.

"I feel you, my first love was violent and I was kinda forced to end it after his dad heard him shoving me into the wall. And like you I had a really hard time while no one understood why I was so sad because he was mean anyways etc..

Can you block her? Her texting you while you try to keep it no contact will only delay your healing..

And continue your therapy, or atleast try to find the right one for you

I promise it gets better"
"Apparently his own house was super clean before moving in with OP, so I doubt he's just terrible at it."
"I think it's just not a very good budgeting strategy to ever consider having extra or bonus money as it just enables that money to be wasted. All work and income should be considered together so you can manage and leverage it effectively. Like even taking out personal loans on your own is a pretty bad idea if you did that without her agreeing to it, and because you are married she still could be liable for things whether or not her name is on them as others have brought up. 

For now, stop doing the side work until you come to a compromise. I think you need to keep talking it out together. Money is one of the main reasons marriages end and this isn't something you should try and sweep under the rug. "
"The love of your life will build you up (and they would be horrified to hurt you) not what this person is doing.

You're toxic together and when you find someone who you're good with, the difference will be night and day.

"&gt;I hate coming home now. I ... have days that start at 6am and end at 10pm. I am beyond exhausted. Lately when I come home after a long day and see the house in disarray I just start crying. ... I’ll spend a few hours cleaning on the weekend and in a couple days you couldn’t even tell I did anything at all ... I think I’m going to ask to see (our therapist) alone instead and pick her brain for the kindest way to break off the engagement without hurting him significantly.

The contrast here is blowing my mind. He has spent years making decisions every single day to act in a way that he knows is making you being miserable. 

And you are seeing a therapist to figure out how to tell him that you won't keep putting up with the despair he's deliberately causing you, without hurting his feelings. 

Maybe don't worry so much about hurting his feelings. I'm not saying go out of your way to hurt him, but just be direct and let him be responsible for processing his own emotions as part of the consequences of his own actions. That's his job, not yours. You've been taking on his share of the physical work around the house and now you want to take on the burden of all the emotional fallout of the relationship ending as well. "
Normal is not good

Don't project your piggy talk on Mr.

You sound like a wonderful person. Stand up for yourself.

"Hon, bottom line, he needs to get a new job and learn some boundaries.  There is no rewind on this.

You can work through this if you want, but first and foremost, he has to leave that job like today.  No if's and's or but's.  "
"This hurt to read. Do you know how bad things have to get before a teenage girl is willing to go to her father literally begging for attention? Before she will go to her dad and *tell him* that she wants to be *hugged*? And how much it would hurt to have that thrown back in her face?

Honestly, I suspect serious damage has been done. Literally the only thing that will help now is sustained change in your behaviour. An apology is empty without changing how you treat her. You need to pay attention to her. Take an interest when she talks about her life. Tell her you're proud of her when she achieves things. Hug her. Tell her you love her. Spend time together, just the two of you. Appreciate when she does things for you or things around the house. And doing all of this for a week won't cut it. It needs to be a real effort to change the way you are as a father."
Completely agree with this ☝️
Sounds like she is not eating enough due to her moms constant criticisms. 
"I’ve had good luck connecting with friends of friends who live in my new city, and in fact that is how I met my current boyfriend and our friend group. I would absolutely agree that even with those connections it has taken me 6-12 months to have a real support network and groups of friends each time I’ve moved. Those months included going to new activities, going on awkward friend first dates and getting out of my comfort zone. Not everything I tried worked, but some of it did. You have to show up at the same thing repeatedly to make friends (whether that is trivia or a volunteer group or whatever) - everything will feel weird the first time."

"When you first start a job, you don't always know where everything is or how to do something quickly. That's part of learning. In the future, it can sometimes be useful to get help/guidance from the other PAs instead of always going to your supervisor, but sometimes it's more efficient to just ask your supervisor.

When you are on set, try to be friendly and approachable. Even just making yourself default to having a bit of a smile or pleasant look on your face can help you to seem more friendly. Learn people's names (that one is important) and don't be shy about saying hi or making a little friendly small talk, especially with people you deal with frequently on set.

Because beauty is such an explicitly desirable trait in the industry, it can unfortunately lead people to feeling comfortable commenting on other people's looks, such as saying you're pretty. Generally speaking, that is a yellow flag, and whoever is doing that in this day and age, you should make a mental note that they are not good people to become reliant on or develop close bonds with. I am a man, so I can't give you a ton of firsthand advice about how to deal with it, but I know my female colleagues (the nice ones) are always willing to help a younger woman navigate the world of showbiz. Having somebody a little more experienced who you can lean on here or there for guidance can be helpful."
I honestly can't believe all the comments shaming OP and saying she should re-home the dog. Clearly the boyfriend is the problem. I can't even believe the fact that he refuses to take the dog out in the mornings. He's not even doing the bare minimum. The only advice I can give is that you should definitely think about your future and if this is the kind of person you'd want to spend the rest of your life with. 
"I'd end it right now. A break in trust is one thing, but making you question yourself is something else. He's behaved really badly. I'm so sorry "
"Yeah. I’ve cut off all contact with my mother’s side of the family. I didn’t attend the funerals of her, my grandmother or my uncle (kinda regret that one, but no changing it now). My mother wasn’t as bad as yours, but it was enough to make me want to get away. 
Best of luck to you!!"
"A BIG red flag is when your significant other calls you crazy. For whatever reason. It’s extremely manipulative behaviour to make you doubt your sense of reality :( 

I’d write a big letter to him and block him everywhere else. He seems to have made it clear that he doesn’t respect your boundaries at all- gurl respek yourself now x"
"God, between this post and your comments... do you actually love her at all? I mean, honestly, please actually sit with yourself and think about it for a minute because I don't see *any* love for her from you. I see you wanting *her* to love *you.* That's not even remotely the same thing."
What else do you think I could improve on?
"&gt;As a former teacher's son I saw the extra work 

A weirdly high percentage of my friends and social circle are teachers. Sure, they have *way* ""days off"" than I do as a private sector office worker.

But when I have a day off, it means I have the day off. When they have a day off it means they're trying to take care of something for the class or planning ahead for the class, and praying they still have time to relax."
DING. 
"If she told you while drunk it's probably something that she's been wanting to tell you for awhile. Being drunk doesn't change what you want, it just lowers your inhibitions. Definitely tell her next time you're both relaxing and in a good mood. CafeteriaMonitor put it well. Just something simple, no pressure, and if she's embarrassed just reassure her that you don't think of her any differently. And definitely don't ever make any comments about what and how she chooses to eat unless it looks concerning or dire, now that you know, because it could come off as you not trusting that she can handle herself now that she's recovered. I've had two cousins with eating disorders and they're both doing good now, but one is really tight-lipped about her experience and the other will tell you all about it. Just take her cues and let her know you love her no matter what. "
"Sounds like he decided to have a pity party instead of an easy conversation with his girlfriend. You tried to engage him when he was doing the dishes and he shut it down. He might just need a bit of time to get over himself but if he tries to pin his disappointment on you again, I hope you shut it down."
"Your puppy isn't being neglected by you she is being neglected by your boyfriend.

Anyone whose response to a dog needing to go to the toilet is ""I'd rather they shit in the house then take them out"" would feel my boot up their ass. 

Your boyfriend is lazy and entitled. My ex was like this. Went on and on about getting a dog but when we got her I soon ended up walking her alone because he couldn't be bothered.  He also didn't want to cut his evenings out short because we needed to get home to her. 

It was one of the main reasons we broke up as he was lazy in a lot of areas of what should have been shared responsibility (housework etc) and I realised he was just too selfish and lazy to do ANYTHING when he knew I would cave and do it myself before he would. Looking back, before we lived together his flat was immaculately clean and the place he moved into after we broke up was the same. So it wasn't a case of couldn't he just saw it all as my job.

If he is this selfish with a dog he will be worse with kids. I'm glad you are looking at Him differently because you *should* evaluate whether this is the right guy for you.

Hope your knee is better soon"
"Honestly, that may not be the worst idea. He's still pretty young and I think his family is trying to fix things, but I think it's his call if he wants to go NC or not. I don't know his feelings on the matter, and I should definitely ask him about it."
"I wouldn't even dignifiy them with a response. You live your life the way you want to live it and if they're going to get their panties in a was because you chose not to go to your abusers funeral, they can suck on a cactus"
"Maybe try a different approach? Ask her what she wants to try in bed? Or what would make her comfortable with trying some of the stuff you want to try? 

Just let her know it really frustrates you that your sex life can’t be more open to new things and that this is important for you. "
I thought that said “we split like a chicken quesadilla” and was confused. 
"You're dont need to argue or justify yourself. I like what another commenter said ""I said goodbye to my mother years ago when she became my abuser"".

Don't exhaust yourself with crappy family who weren't there when you needed them the most. 

"
Your mother embarrassed herself. I bet that waiter was appalled. I was a waitress and have seen stuff like that said. Don't abuse your children or anyone in front of waitstaff; that's how you get spit in your food.
"I think you are right, and it's really hard to admit to myself."
"Good for you for sticking up for yourself after everything you’ve been through. I’m glad it was only an attempt and you are still here today. If you haven’t already, maybe seek counseling as you have been through a tremendous amount and talking about it with someone who won’t have a biased opinion on the matter will make the difference!"
"I don't understand why you think it's bonus money. You are working for it like your main job and there isn't anything extra about it. It's just you earning more money and wanting to keep it for yourself. I think you are being selfish. Though I also think it's unreasonable for her to want to create expectations around something you are doing on the side that is not an actual second job. 

If you want to put it in savings as a safety net, that's also different than you treating it like spending money once the loan is paid off. Did you off that as a compromise, just putting it into emergency savings?"
"Maybe it’s the initial shock combined with jealousy that made your wife react that way. You’re money is your money, especially when you contribute the same amount to your joint account. You are putting in the extra hours for your side hustle on top of your main profession, so you get decide how that extra money is spent. If it got to a point that it affected how much you contribute to your shared account, then it would be an issue. "
"&gt; should I let it lie because she knows, anyway, and doesn’t need to hear “I told you so” from me? 

Exactly this. Because what will essentially saying ""I told you so"" **actually** accomplish? Make you feel better? Doubtful, especially given the hurt/resentment/tension it will cause. Make her learn from her mistake? Unless she's clueless she already has. As you say, she **knows** you warned her about this! Reminding her serves no purpose - it should only be brought up if you find yourselves in a similar situation again, and even then just in terms of ""remember last time"" rather than ""if only you'd listened to me"".

Read up on ""ring theory"" - whether you like it or not, this affects her more than you, because all the life plans, etc. affect her just as much, **plus** the knowledge that she screwed up, **plus** the fact that she's affected her own career. What she needs from you now is support, and if she's a decent partner and person she'll really appreciate you not bringing up ""I told you so"" and it'll make your relationship stronger overall.

Vent to friends and others about your annoyance, without making her the bad guy, just because it's good to get it out. She didn't dismiss your advice out of hand, she made a judgment call and it happened to be the wrong one. And somewhat selfishly, also ""bank"" this, metaphorically - the next time you screw up, and you will, trust that she'll remember and be grateful that you didn't lord it over her, and she'll treat you with the same courtesy. You can express your frustrations **together** that things didn't work out - focus on your shared annoyance that this has knocked your plans a bit, but without blaming her or turning it into ""well I did say..."" She's no doubt annoyed and a bit embarrassed, you can support each other without pointing fingers - the resentment will pass given time, but feeding it will just prolong that."
"The idea that STEM students are doing something that is humanities plus extra is such constant nonsense and I don't think you should brook it particularly far. I'm in a subject area that people at turns denigrate as a university choice and hold up as something they 'could never do' (languages) and I hate the rhetoric around all of this in general, even /especially when it benefits me. 

As an example, I live with chemistry masters students who could tell me comparatively little about the masses of implicit information about geography/history/politics even my most apathetic languages classmates have had to absorb through study of Germany/China (not to mention the obvious language skills), and we all routinely look at each other like the others are crazy for not knowing answers in game shows we think are obvious - and then we take the piss out of our own presumption/arrogance because there's no reason for that to be true. There is a lot of hidden knowledge you will have gained, based on ideas now so basic to you that they're barely worth commenting on, and the underlying assumption to all this, that your bf would thrive doing your degree, is a poor one. 

 Don't sell your talents short to appeal to his weird academic oneupsmanship, in summary. I can think of plenty of medics I've met with shocking holes in skills or information that I view as pretty basic for an educated adult, and sure, there's an instinct to snobbery when it's 'your thing' people don't understand, but in my opinion what tells is the action you choose after that instinct: whether you mock or include, deride or explain. I don't necessarily think you should DTMF but I think jumping to mockery is a really telling response. "
"He sounds like a real piece of shit. 

 Believe it or not there are people out there that treat others they love with kindness and respect. You don’t claim to love someone and then tear them down. That isn’t love."
"NTA

this dude doesn’t want to change his behavior or accommodate an adult relationship into his life. He will keep walking all over you and putting your needs behind his, regardless of the situation. What happens if you really needed him? He sounds unreliable. "
She never expressed any of this until this morning but like others have said maybe she’s just now comfortable enough to say it
"Sounds like you're with a freeloader. Leech. Slug. Why would he expect you to fund his life???  And why would you be unsure about funding his life?? If 600-800 is cheap, why are you only charging him 200? Charge him 500, at least, and show him housemate ads, so he sees what a great deal he is getting?

Do not move in until you get what you deserve. And I would get a firm contract. I bet once he gets in, he fonds reasons to be short on money. 

You are seeing him in his true colors. The shit he is pulling is a glimpse into your future.."

"&gt; Relationships are not only about sex...

When the sex is good/healthy, it’s only one small part of the relationship.

When the sex is bad, it’s a *giant* factor in the relationship.

It’s poor advice to suggest that someone stay in a relationship where they’re sexually unfulfilled and see sex as a dreaded chore that they just “want to get over with”. That’s *guaranteed* to end in resentment and frustration."
"What you need to find is a gay-friendly religious resource for him to talk to. Sure, he won’t go to your LGBT therapist. But will he say no when you tell him about the new congregation you’ve started visiting and ask him to sit down with you and the pastor?  My congregation is full of openly LGBT members and their families. This may not be your spiritual path right now but you need to meet your son where he is right now. "
"I agree with you!  This girl is definitely comes across spoiled and childish.

&amp;#x200B;

But a rigid 50/50 relationship sounds exhausting, too.   It's so...calculated the way her talks about it in the post.  Especially when OP states he makes it a point to pay for every third meal.    It's important that he sets boundaries and understands his values, but a lot of people might be turned off by how calculated and mechanical everything is.    "

Anyone who play games like this should be avoided.
"What do you mean authority to ""let""? Do you mean ""not let""? because I said I DO let him have friends who are girls, not that I don't. I never told him he can't I don't understand where you got that from. And he's not an autonomous person when he agrees to be in a relationship with me, that is agreeing to being ""mine""? Like if he were autonomous person he could go sleep with whatever girl he wants and I can't get angry because it is his choice. If he were autonomous person it would be stranger for me to just walk up to him and kiss or touch him sexually without consent, but there is pre-agreed to things when you're in relationship. When you enter relationship you give up some of your autonomy to become a unit, does it make sense? "
"You did your best to help a woman who needed love by... trapping her in a hellish loveless relationship for years, tied down without the chance to find ACTUAL love? Wat."
"Yes, you are meddling too much."
I'm not passing moral judgement on what the parents are doing for themselves I'm just saying sometimes we gave to heal ourselves if others aren't willing to be active participants in that healing.
I don't know if the husband is completely to blame when her job has her out of the house for extended periods of time.  That would put a strain on even the strongest of relationships.
Here is the thing though. If this is your gut feeling and you don't trust him anymore. The relationship is already over. 
"Here's the thing, if you don't tell him how you feel about his staying over, it will become a ""regrettable incident"" where you don't feel heard or your feelings appreciated.  Over time, small incidents where you do not feel heard, leave you in a stunted relationship.

Tell him that the staying over bothered you.  It's just that simple.  He needs to know that it. "

"So if my brothers and I are spending less time with him (which has been the case), we just shouldn't say why? My plan had been to sort of slow fade them but I didn't know if it was worth making a last ditch effort. "
"Here are some scripts:

- “I’m not going to discuss my sex life with you.”
- “I’m not going to debate this with you.” 
- “We each know how the other person feels and it’s not helping to keep discussing this. We’ll have to agree to disagree.” 
- “I’m not going to do that.”

She may respond to these statements with, “But...” And then you get to be a broken record of repeating yourself. I also find the statement, “That’s your choice,” (said in a calm tone of voice) to be very helpful when someone threatens to do something like cut you off. When you say that you acknowledge the threat, make clear you aren’t intimidated by it, and force the person to acknowledge that THEY are choosing to do the action and you aren’t falling for their claim that you are somehow making them do it.

And as much as I hate to say it, I wouldn't even be positive that her story is true. She might be trying to ruin his life by having you be the one to spread the rumors . Otherwise, if she's so determined to get the story out, why not tell people herself? If she's part of a power couple, surely she has enough influence.

I make good money ($70k), have good benefits (incl. a free gym membership), get 4 weeks vacation and travel abroad twice/year by living within my means (rent a one bedroom apart in a high COL city, own our car outright, have zero debt, don't go out to restaurants, etc. often). 

There are far worse things than working in a office. Is it my passion? God no. So I co-run a registered non-profit animal rescue on the side because that is my passion and there is absolutely no money in that line of work. I've accepted that, so I've made it my ""hobby"". "

"We recently talked about it over text and she's open to the idea. How would we go about it without it being awkward? I'm a one girl kind of guy so all of this is a bit odd and overwhelming to transition into a relationship like that. Therapy has never worked for me, but I just started doing a specialized therapy for PTSD. She's seeing the same doctor, but I think her anxiety is a bit different. Our problems definitely put a strain on the relationship, but I can see them getting better."

"At first I wondered why you were dating someone so young. Then I read your post, and I think I get it now. 

You need to calm down. He's allowed to have friends that you don't know, like, etc. He doesn't require your approval. He does require your trust to make a relationship work. If you can't do that, you need to move on and do some work on yourself. "
"How does your girlfriend feel about you going on this trip? Does she know you're going on it? I don't think the trip itself is ""cheating,"" but everyone has their own definition of the word.

"For the record, pregnancy symptoms and pre-menstrual symptoms are indistinguishable - they are both caused by the hormone progesterone spike which is always present after ovulation whether you are pregnant or not.  If she has ""pregnancy symptoms"", these are most likely not pregnancy symptoms as there hasn't been enough time for the pregnancy hormone to even be created after implantation which takes 7-10 days and then it takes at least several days for the body to even produce the pregnancy hormone let alone to a level that would cause a symptom. Most pregnant women do not feel pregnancy specific symptoms until around 5 weeks after ovulation. Nipple size and breast tenderness are both symptoms caused by progesterone, and they can vary each month due to many factors, not just pregnancy.

There's no way she could possibly know if she is pregnancy in any way, shape or form at this point in time. As a woman, I promise you this. There is zero chance she knows whether or not she is pregnant until you take a test and miss a period."

"Try not going about it as a diet. Diets always fail. The only food related way to lose weight is to maintain eating balanced, healthy meals long term. See if she would take cooking classes with you. The two of you could have a joint hobby, cook together, and develop well-rounded eating routines.

Afterwards, she could consider rejoining the gym or taking up other active endeavors. All in all, if it's not a mental or physical detriment keeping her from losing the weight she should find a size that makes her happy."
She needs to communicate that is key! It’s silly for her to think you can read her mind and know what she wants in the moment. Tell her what you wrote here and why you don’t initiate and if she wants a healthy sex drive she has to communicate what she likes and vice versa. After awhile you don’t have to ask and talk as much cause you get into the flow but you do need to talk. 
"Ashley invited you because her BF bailed, so you're meant to be Ashley's +1 despite you knowing Lindsay better. My guess is that Lindsay wants to ride up alone wit her BF and their dog (part way) and doesn't want a third wheel (you) accompanying them since the four of you will likely be together all weekend. They likely also want some alone time in the house before you arrive. Two couples traveling together is a couple's trip - this is now just a group trip where no one is going to ""couple up"" and drift off, meaning they aren't going to have much alone time.

I'd just go with Ashley and suck it up or cancel. If Lindsay really didn't mind you tagging along on the ride up she'd have said, ""Sure as long as you don't mind sharing the back seat with our dog!""  (to which I, personally, would have replied ""F\*ck yeah that sounds perfect!"" because I adore dogs big and small)."
"My sense is that OP is the type of person who would totally have drinks with a close acquaintance who was hurting, to give them some comfort. The problem is, she knows that, and is probably taking advantage of OP.  


OP, there is absolutely nothing wrong with being compassionate and empathetic. Those are good traits. But coming from someone who is also known for those things, people can and will exploit those qualities. Don't let yourself get taken advantage of. "

Thanks for the advice. Why he thinks I'm toxic is kind of what I want to understand. I don't know because I'm pretty sure I've never treated him badly.
It was unplanned...by you. She and Matt had their agenda tight and on point. You just got played.
"""We had a threesome"" implies sex with him too, that he didn't consent to. "

"The book I found on this sub a while back ago was ""She Comes First."" Its like the holy grail for sex. I read it and it helped a lot not ok only with what to do but to just be more understanding of the female body."
 I said possibly because we don’t know the info from the post.
"These type of posts drive me crazy. Instead of taking a cheap test that will give an answer, they freak out prematurely or they tend to ask everyone else if they are pregnant. I truly do not understand. 

I remember thinking many many times that I was pregnant because I felt off. Was I? Nope. I used tests to confirm. Turns out when I actually got pregnant, I had no clue. "
Thanks for the reference. Much appreciated!
"You **let him** have friends who are girls? Like, you think he needs your permission to have friends who are girls? Good lord. "

"I would say don't tell your parents. As you said, it won't really change anything. Because of her age, there is a chance they'll react badly and tell her not to even though they do it themselves. But you know that them telling her not to won't change anything.

Not only that but your sister has confided in you. She trusts you with this information. In this case, it's not something particularly worrying but if you were to share that information without her permission it may make her wary of telling you things in the future. It's not worth her feeling you've betrayed her trust like that.

I can understand your concern. She is a lot younger than I was when I tried that sort of thing but that seems to be quite common now.  Just talk to her, encourage her to do it safely and in moderation. "
"Wow I didn't know that, thanks for the correction!"
"I know, I completely agree. I wouldn’t DARE confront my parents or even vent to my friends because I don’t want to sound like a brat. I’m actually very appreciative of my parents and I know it could always be worse. I need to work on ignoring it, which would be easy if they treated my sister like me. I just wonder why they were so different with me, and that’s what bothers me. "
"Regarding that wording - I think self defense describes it better. 

I was doing what felt like the only option, to get his hands off me in that moment, after shoving the previous times hadn't worked."
"It’s one thing if he asks her, but it is a completely different thing for her to just go up to him and tell him that he’s ugly. And even if he did ask, there are tactful ways of answering his question, that are honest and not straight up hateful."
I know right? But thank you! Yes essentially I wanted more opinions that I’m doing what is right for both of us. 
"Are you sure dinner is the right forum for that. Unless you’re comfortable walking out before it’s over, you’re a captive audience. For now, walking away is probably the best means you have to enforce your boundary."
Yup.  100% keep your head down on this and maybe update your resume because that work environment might get downright toxic.
You're an idiot if you think a 14 year old as the same mentality of a 17 year old. 
Yes. Honesty is the best policy!
It could be you made her uncomfortable with that statement. You describe how you said it but not what her reaction was.  You don't really know her at all and have just been watching following her around at her job. Stop creeping around and just ask her out on a date. Be direct and if she says no or doesn't react then it's time to move on. 
Dude 'leave her' is that your answer for everything that goes wrong? They can work through this and she can learn from her one time mistake. That it wasn't right and he does not condone it. COMMUNICATION!
"Pretend it never happened? WHAT?

Look, you started this by slapping him first. What pushed your buttons so badly that you gave yourself permission to hit him? You both need to sit  down and do some real soul searching. Therapy too, yes, but probably individually. You need better anger management tools so that it never gets to this point again. In the short term, agree to walk away from each other and cool off if arguments ""get heated."" If you can't do that you shouldn't be in a relationship, period. "
"Are you not telling her who you're going with because you're afraid she will get upset? Someone once told me that they see cheating as ""anything you feel like you have to hide from your partner,"" and that has stuck with me over the years. If you go on the trip with another female without telling your girlfriend who you're with, I don't think that's right."
"&gt;I just don't trust other girls

Honestly that's a scary and immature stance to take. You have no reason not to trust them. And if you ACTUALLY trusted him ""completely"", you would trust him to handle his own shit. If a girl were to make a move on my husband, I trust he would shut it down, let me know it happened, and then make changes so that it wouldn't happen again (like not spending time with her one-on-one anymore, or not texting her anymore or whatever). I Trust my husband to respond to inappropriate situations appropriately. You seem to think these girls are going to force themselves on your boyfriend and that he's, what, going to be unable to say no? What are you ACTUALLY afraid of here? What about this is intimidating to you?

That's what you need to get to the bottom of."
"You are definitely meddling.  You have put yourself in the middle.  Your boyfriend is clear that he doesn't want to hang out with his sister and yet for some reason, you feel obligated to get involved.

She is asking you about hanging out because she knows she won't get any traction with her brother.  You are making things uncomfortable nd awkward. 

Leave it for him to deal with his sister, butt out."
How old is your daughter?
"Why the hell would they support your decision to take a year off?  Sounds to me like you are constantly creating situations to get attention and sympathy, and I bet your parents are tired of it and have been tired of it for years!  Needy people are exhausting.  I am willing to bet you have been like this since about age 13, insist on dressing like a weirdo and have been a constant source of stress for both of your parents and that you are constantly needing something.  Sometimes college is hard.  Work harder.  Don’t move home after you graduate high school.  "
"&gt;I don't know if I need or would be comfortable with one yet

If your gut instinct says you don't want one, then it won't work."
"It's a very sad thing that some women become socialized such that they don't know how to comfortably handle relationships that aren't flirty or sexual. Your girlfriend sounds like she's one such woman. That mentality is VERY unhealthy, and she needs to start undoing it. You could try talking to her, but it may not work. It doesn't sound like she's ready to admit she has a problem. "
"Did you ask your girlfriend her thoughts? Here's my rule of thumb:

If you don't know if something is cheating: ask. If you don't ask, then it's cheating. If she says she's not okay with it and you do it anyways, then it's cheating. But, she might be cool with it and say go ahead. 

Personally, I would not feel comfortable with my SO going on a trip with just another guy for three whole days. So in my opinion, while it might not be cheating explicitly, it is definitively a breach of trust. "
"That is so dumb &amp; unhealthy. You have to tell her about the trip, because she’ll be even more upset to learn you went through extensive planning while not saying a word to her. If she gets upset, try to deal with her feelings on it, but you might as well kiss this relationship goodbye for good if you keep hiding it. She will find out. And she will feel rightly deceived. You being scared of her reaction isn’t an excuse to not tell her. 

“My girlfriend is irrationally suspicious my female friends want me. So I’m going to plan a trip, in secret, with one of them, which I know makes it look like she had reason to he suspicious, because I’m hiding it.”  

Is it rational that she’s so jealous? No. You need to get her to address that. It’s unhealthy &amp; a relationship can’t survive it. But if you think you doing this won’t make it ten times worse, you’re stupid. 

She will find out, and if you think her upset over the planning will be bad, then just wait for the nuclear meltdown when she finds out you were hiding it. Good luck. "
"I think if you have a history of coming on too strong, you should err on the side of caution.  Don't try to ask as soon as she's ready, ask as soon as you need the relationship to be better defined.  "
Best of luck dealing with the borderline sister. 
"She either can't handle the responsibilities of an adult relationship or knows what she's doing and keeping you as a fallback.  This is rediculous.

If she needs something to do, she can hang out with friends.

Sounds like she's playing you."
"Uh don’t think that’s it, he’s a bit husky and I’m a little chubby. But no that’s not it."

"&gt; i was hoping she could eventually be the one to not want anything to do with me anymore

And that hasn't worked, has it?  Tell her straight out you no longer want contact with her, do not Justify, Argue, Defend, or Explain (JADE) your reasons, and block here."
"Well, your mutual friends are pretty dumb if they think that Tom ""accidentally"" grabbed your ass multiple times, as you repeatedly shoved him away and told him to stop. I would lay out the sequence of events exactly as you have here to anyone who asks you about it or brings it up, but I would not mention how drunk anyone was relative to anyone else because it doesn't really matter. Anyone who gropes you, you are justified in defending yourself. 

I don't know if there is much point in specifically confronting his girlfriend about it, though. I would just make sure that your friends who you care about know the truth. "
"I wouldn't call it ""lesser""... there are strong gender-based norms that dictate women should be ""dainty"" and men should be big/strong/tall. It's normal to struggle with going against social norms when you've had them shoved at you from every angle since birth. "
Drop her like ebola.  She's bad news.

"Maybe instead of asking her to be exclusive right away, you could just ask where she sees going with the two of you. Have the ""what are we?"" talk. I don't think it's too soon to ask that. "
Just chill. You don’t need to convince them. You just need to not get married off. That’s way easier. 
"Dont do anything. There's no reason to be petty and block her because she blocked you ext. Move on with your life and focus on your self. Maybe one day your relationship will be repaired, but if she doesnt want to make it right you should just do your own thing."
Does this hobby have any sort of moderator/higher-up you could notify?
"Well, it's really not your call, and you do hate her and want her gone.  Given your age, and the fact that this is your stepdad's life, I think you should leave it alone.  You have your own life (or should by now) and he has his."
"Man, I'm sorry. Truth be told, Jack doesn't need any reasons to be friends- or not to be friends- with you, and sometimes this is how things go when people go through big changes. It's possible you remind him of some negative memories because of some associations you have no control over or responsibility for.

I think you should respect his stated request for no contact. Yes, it sucks, and I think you deserve more than just being cut off with no warning or reasons. If Jack comes back into your life, I would make it a requirement that he tell you exactly what happened and warn him you won't tolerate him doing that again because of how unfair and hurtful it was. But until then, going back and asking for more information would only be pushing his boundaries, and doing so would indeed make you toxic to him."

"It’s definitely not a good thing but you shouldn’t be knocking or banging on his door at 3 am. He was probably half asleep and drunk and didn’t mean to do anything wrong. Explain to him if he feels this badly about it he should make an effort to change instead of dumping you. If it’s something that he’s so humiliated or mortified by he will make the correct changes in his life and by doing so, make you guys stronger.  "
"1) By being rude and saying you don't want opinions. People's opinions is the whole point of this sub.

2) You refuse to listen to people giving you advice. You don't have to like it, but at least keep your mind open. Adults take into consideration what others say and form their own decisions. You're just completely shutting down.

3) You are now exaggerating. Who said you should have emotionless flings? You're making stuff up like a child would. Ideally, a good relationship would fulfill both your emotional and physical needs. This is something you learn with age."
I don't think you should try and work this out. I think you need to go see a lawyer right away. She either raped you or cheated literally in front of you. 
"&gt; but I feel like a lot of them aren't the type of girl you'd want around your boyfriend

You shouldn't judge people so quickly without good reason

&gt; Like some of them always click like on his Instagram pictures, and on Snapchat they always send him stupid selfies (nothing sexual, but trying to look cute with filters).

There's nothing wrong with liking other people's photos. I'm a straight guy and I like my friends photos. Do you like your girl friends photos? Does that mean anything romantic or sexual or significant? Of course not. I also don't think the selfies are a big deal but if that makes you uncomfortable you should talk to him about it, but truthfully I don't think it's that big of a deal. 

&gt; I asked that he blocked some of them on Instagram

That is not okay, because it is very possible, even likely that he IS just friends with these people. You're asking him to cut off his friends for you, and that is really fucked up of you. He is right to be upset at you for requesting this. 

&gt; and I felt in a way he was choosing them over me?

If I had to choose between my friends and a highschool relationship, I would have chosen my friends in a heartbeat, too. 

Personally, I think you're reading into it too much. You guys are young, and he's only 15, he's at a very social age. He's still in the early half of highschool and forming friendships, so let him form friendships. 

Your insecurity isn't invalid but I think it's something you should work on. Have adult conversations with him about the things that make you feel uncomfortable, but you also have to respect that he cannot drop friendships in the name of your insecurities. 

Personally I think asking him to not like or comment on other people's photos is too much. I mean, unless he's commenting flirty things. If he is then you have a valid reason to be upset. "
Show him some of the family subs - raisedbynarcissist and JustNoFamily and ask him if these are the experiences he wants his children to live through. 
"You are right to be concerned about brain development as that has been clinically shown to be a negative of smoking so young.  Encourage her to use high CBD, very low THC strains.  That's what I use for cramps and anxiety, and you don't get the risk of the developmental problems with CBD. 

I wouldn't rat her out."
"Tinder is a dating app, people usually use it to find hookups...."
"It sounds like you have some points that have nothing to do with weight, so I suggest approaching her about that. She has low energy, she talks critically about herself, she doesn't want to socialize with you because she doens't like the way she looks. Talk to her about those things - you love her, you don't like hearing her talk about herself so negatively - tell her you'd be mad if anyone talked that way about anyone you loved! - you want to enjoy going out with her, that sort of thing. 

Crappy diet -  menu plan, eat healthy together. Suggest she sign up for a weekly yoga class to relax and gain flexibility. 

Don't focus on \*losing weight to be healthy\* but instead \*improving her health\* in general. 

&amp;#x200B;"
"I honestly think you to stop telling your boyfriend it is ok to hang out with this person. Although he has never treated your boyfriend poorly, it does your boyfriend no good to have such a toxic person in his life. Your boyfriend can decide the best way to handle his relationship with this guy - whether he wants to sit down and discuss his hateful treatment of others or just slowly distance himself is his choice. When discussing the issue with your boyfriend, you don’t need to deliver an ultimatum. Perhaps a good middle ground would be for your boyfriend to only hang out with this guy in a group setting and stop fostering the relationship. "

"I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. Just relax, take a deep breath. There are plenty of people who are still virgins in their 20s. If you are thinking of losing your virginity to her, you should be able to put some trust in her. ""Look, I was embarrassed to bring this up earlier because I really like you. But I'm a virgin and honestly, I'm a bit nervous about this weekend. Can we talk about it?"" If she's a decent human being, she will understand and want to make you comfortable. If she's not a decent human being, you don't want to be dating her anyway. Have faith that you are worth more than your outward appearance and sexual experience. Don't have sex if you're terrified. A good partner will make you feel safe and cared for. "
"Then you should have picked a friend you trust and asked them to wait with you while you called a taxi, or got an uber, or walk with you to the bus stop if it's safe where you live. You can also walk into any of the well lit late night fast food places open and ask to wait in there because someone is scaring you. I know I'm catching downvotes because it sounds like I'm blaming you, but I'm not. I'm just trying to tell you there's more options available. If you felt in imminent physical danger then you reacted appropriately for yourself, but if something had gone wrong and you had seriously injured him or killed him accidently then your life would be ruined over him grabbing your butt. Don't give a creep that much power. "
"Yeah, I mean I get that it can be expensive. I Uber into the city almost every weekend and it’s $30 each way plus tip, so I spend $70 bucks just to Uber. It’s still better than driving drunk or being stranded somewhere and needing to find a place to crash. "

"The people who don't want to break up after being cheated on amaze me.  Not in a bad way, but amaze me how you can continue to foresee trustworthy behavior in their future.

In the future:  Closure is for BEFORE you enter a new relationship, not after you've already started a new one.  ""Closure"" while you're in a committed relationship with someone new is just a sly way of seeing the person again and trying to re-kindle the emotional bond."
"Dude leave her alone, you’re playing games and breaking her heart over and over, leading her on cause you don’t know what you want. Stop doing that, it’s cruel. Let her move on, she deserves someone who has there life together and knows what they want. You are not that person "
"I tried doing less the first three times he grabbed for me. Just shoving him away a little harder each time, and yelling at him to keep away.

"I have a friend who's in a similar situation- she was never allowed anything growing up but now her younger sibling is doted on.

Your parents are horrible managers of their own restaurant- not firing someone who's doing a terrible job because they're too lazy to find replacements is atrocious. How old are you? You need to immediately work somewhere else and hopefully move out as soon as you can. 
Don't sit home with the kids while she goes out. They are old enough to be left at home. Follow her or insist that you go with her. Let her know that you are aware of her shady actions. Get a lawyer and check your options. The sooner you confront her the better you will be.

You can't understand it because it makes no sense and she's lying to you. She wants to keep going on dates and hooking up with guys and wants you to be okay with it. You're not okay with it, so break up with her. Otherwise she'll keep disrespecting your relationship."
"AKA - by being a mature adult.

OP is a 23 year old child."
"The wife was probably pumping OP for information as well, getting her to confirm suspicions, fill in blanks, etc. I really don’t think it was simply a “go and spread the word” kind of thing. This seems like pretty high level manipulation from the wife, and OP being a 28 year old female who seems to be regarded as “friends” with the boss... I wouldn’t be surprised if the rumor mill churned out something about her as well. "
"My bf is 4 inches or so shorter than me. It doesn't bother us at all. We makes jokes at each other, like when he needs things at the top of the cupboard, etc.... I am also a bit curvy and he is thin, not an issue. Be happy, enjoy each other, those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind. "
"Why can't she join some kind of club at school or meet people on things that aren't tinder?   
I do believe that you can make friends with people on tinder but the first intention is always dating and to go into it looking for friends is strange. It seems like she just wants an excuse to freely date again. She might not be sexually involved with them but emotionally cheating is a thing.

"Uh, quit stringing her along? I get it, you don't love her, but if you care about her, only slightly, you will break up with her because what you are doing now is only going to make matters worse."
"People have been arrested for groping where I live, though. There was a guy who would come up behind women with his bicycle, grope them, and then pedal away. He groped a bunch of women before he finally got arrested and charged. Maybe they only bothered charging him because there was more than one woman, but he was doing exactly what the guy in the OP did so where I live at least, this is illegal. 

I was just googling it because I couldn't remember how it ended up, and apparently he got deported because he did not have legal residency status. If you look up DC bike groper or Oscar Mauricio Cornejo-Pena you should be able to find it. I'm not any sort of legal expert but is it truly legal to repeatedly grope someone over the course of the evening, while they clearly and repeatedly tell you no?"
The second chance you're giving him is letting him walk away from that situation alive. I think that's been more then generous already.
"Yeah, that's a statutory rape charge."
"Saying they are just smiley faces is like saying anything they say to each other even if it's sexual is fine because it's just ""words"" or sending nudes to eachother is fine because it's just ""pictures"". The context makes a significant difference, and I understand what you're saying but I feel like you think I am putting arbitrary boundaries on him just for the sake of exerting control over him, I'm doing because I care about him and like boys can often be oblivious to when girls are flirting with them or interested in them. He is only fifteen so I think is pretty normal to feel protective of him I'm about to turn nineteen and like I also have a little brother who is his age so I think it is natural to feel that way, what is scary precedent about it?

I could go to therapist about it but I just feel it is kinda necessary as I thought these issues are very common in relationships, and so you are not protective of your husband? If he was in physical danger you wouldn't care? or if you were with him and some woman was being harassing toward him even if he shut her down I'm sure you would still feel angry about it whether you admit or not. It is a normal reaction, and well I'm Christian and in my view kinda he is not his own person like he is mine if we are in a relationship? "
"I'm overly confident in my relationships BUT I still get insecure too. Most of the time, I think it's attractive that I can trust my man to do what he wants and not cheat. But once in a blue moon, I get that pit in my stomach when I see him talking to someone I don't know. I just tell myself, ""He loves me, and if he really loves me, he will continue to respect me.""

My current SO and I both have never cheated and we have talked about coming to each other before anything ever got that serious bad.  I have to remind myself that while my exes were crappy, my current SO has been loyal, open with his feelings and has earned my trust though his words and actions. If he were to hurt me, I know that it's not because I wasn't good enough, it would be because he wasn't good enough for me....

"I saw recently where lots of guys have radically different tastes in real partners and porn. I would not worry too much about it. Plus it says a lot that he was willing to share his stuff with you.

"Yeah i guess that sentence could've have been misconstrued in it's meaning.

I feel like you posted this exact same thing a couple weeks ago. I understand that you are trying to be sensitive to your husband but what is he doing to support you? Is it possible for him to bring his mother back with him? Are there any other relatives who can help with taking care of her so that he can return home to you?

"&gt;Not top and tail my bed with jess knowing I'm not gonna have a great night sleep and that she'll wake me up at 7am

I had to google what this meant. LOL dude why are you letting her sleep in your bed? Or in your room at all? Don't you have a living room floor or couch she can crash on? That way you'd sleep better and she won't wake you up. Seems like an easy solution to me. You really need to be better about setting boundaries. If I were like Jess, too drunk to get home and a friend offered to let me sleep on their living room floor for free, I'd be totally thankful for that. I would not feel entitled to their bed and I would feel mortified if I knew I woke them up in the morning. 

If she didn't sleep in your bed, would you be okay with her crashing with you? 

Step 1: Figure out how often you want Jess to stay over, and how you want her to stay over. Once a week is too much, but would once a month be okay? Or you want to stop hosting her altogether? If you do still want to host her, do you want her to stop staying in your bed? Where would be a good place for her to sleep so as not to disturb you? Figure out what you want. Come up with a plan that works for you.

Step 2: communicate new plan to Jess. ""Hey Jess, I have a lot of fun when we go out with friends, but it's actually been a little uncomfortable for me to host you. I like my privacy and peace and quiet. Starting now I \[can only host you once a month, and you can sleep in the living room\] \[cannot host you anymore\] \[etc\]"" 

Step 3: hopefully Jess is a reasonable person and thanks you for hosting her in the past, and promises to respect your boundaries in the future. If she tries to argue with you, just tell her it's your home and you need a good night's sleep, period, no negotiations. "
"If they're sexually active, it's actually illegal. This is weird... and obviously she can't expect much from him as far as a long-term monogamous relationship goes. "

"You need to be blunt and clear. It's very sad what happened, but he vowed to build a life with you in your country. He needs to be loyal to you first, and wanting your husband home after months abroad is reasonable. "
Not sure why you're confused- she was kind enough to be honest with you and you should trust what she says. She didn't feel a connection on her end and was enjoying spending time with you until she decided she wasn't anymore and didn't want to lead you on. It happens. People change their minds and you should feel lucky that she didn't just ghost you. 
"I never said she wasn't a victim. You can be a victim and retaliate not just in self defense. You are somehow assuming that retaliation cancels outs being a victim, which makes no sense."

"Getting told to get out is not healthy or good for the relationship. What would happen if you didn't have a place to go - would you spend the night in your car? She needs a better want to deal with the stresses in her life.

"No, but I've accidentally been on the other side, as the other guy. And I can tell you, she had no remorse about it when her boyfriend (who I didn't know about) saw a rather explicit message I sent to her the next day.

He didn't find out that she had come over to have sex with me the night before, but he obviously knew something was up. Her only response to the situation was to beg me not to tell him what happened, she didn't really seem to give a shit about the actual fact that it did happen, just that she got caught.

Don't fall for it, she isn't remorseful at all, she doesn't care about you, and giving her another chance will just lead to heartbreak. EVERYBODY in these comments is telling you the same thing for a reason, not because it's the cool thing to do, but because there's only one thing TO do.

I understand your perspective as far as jealousy is concerned. That kind of thing is a boundary that needs to be discussed in relationships.

And that’s neither here nor there on whether that’s a proper way to think or not but in communication with your partner you will be able to find this boundary. Some of my closest friends are in relationships where they’ll talk about ‘a hot guy that came into work’ in front of their partner and that’s all good with them. Because that boundary is a bit looser between them. Find yourself a partner that you see eye to eye on those kinds of things. 

But, you had to convince him to be official with you? If he doesn’t want to be with you, he doesn’t. And if he does want to be with you he’ll show you and make it pretty damn clear. Don’t be with somebody that you had to force into being with you. It’s like fitting mismatched puzzle pieces together. You’ll find somebody that will fit your needs much more properly I promise. "

I'm not your boyfriend, but I suggest giving him the basics bc hiding it would be weird, but find a different person to be your primary support for this. Tell him you got an interview and say what day it's on. Acknowledge that it might be hard for him to hear since you know he is bummed that he hasn't heard. Answer any questions, thank him for any congratulations, and drop the subject with him. Don't give him false assurances, don't downplay your qualifications, sure as shit don't give up the opportunity. If you need to jump up and down and sing or something, call a friend or your mom for that kind of thing. If he resents you, it's kind of a him problem, and you don't have to go out of your way to turn his resentment around.

"What is fair is a mutually beneficial living arrangement where both the renter and owner get to save some money, not a leech of a renter bumming off the owner.



Let's put numbers to this. For simplicity sake, if owner buys house and let's renter move in immediately and they share the place for 5 years.

Renter would normally be paying 1k for a one bedroom (low for my area) and would have spent 1kx12x5 = 60k in that time period

Owner takes a 120k mortgage (30 k down, 150k total) at 4.5% for 30 yrs. In 5 yrs owner would have paid 26k in interest and have 109k left on the principal balance. That means owner built 11k in equity but paid 26k in interest, so overall down 15k. On top of that you need to pay taxes (roughly 3k) and insurance (roughly 1k) each year so owner is down another 20k in expenses. Total is 35k in the hole, still better than the renter.


Now let's say the renter moves in and only pays $400 a month.
Renter pays 24k over 5 yrs (a net savings of 36k for them). Owner now has a net savings of 24k and is only 11k in the hole.


Oh hooo! What about the increased value of the home when you sell? If you're lucky that jumped 10k (minus 4800 at least in realtors fees when you sell plus whatever you negotiate with the buyers). Depends on your market, no guarantee. You could sell at a loss too. Owner gets to eat that cost.

But wait!! We forgot about repairs and maintenance! The unexpected. In the first 5 yrs in my place I spent 4k on the roof, 3k on dead tree removal, 3k on a/c system, and 800 for a hot water heater (plus other smaller repairs or upgrades). Roughly 11k in total. Renters don't pay for that.

So overall renter pays 24k (saving 36k) and owner saves 24k but is still paying about 11k (potentially 20k+) or more in cost. Versus the owner paying 35k and renter paying 0 (when they could be paying 60k not living there). Which is more fair? 



Plus all the existing equity in the home becomes shared the minute they marry, sell the house, and buy a new one together. Pay rent... Don't leech."

Okay, this is The Big Test.  This is where you are supposed to chase after her and Fight For the Relationship.  How do you do that?  I don't know.  *She* doesn't really know.  Give in to her, yes, of course, but this Fighting For the Relationship involves something *more,* something *grander,* something of such power that her knees will buckle at the sight of it.

She is young and clearly inexperienced.  She's only begun to grapple with love and adulthood and her judgments are clouded by the toxic fumes of popular romance (god *damn*, does the Romantic Movement have a lot to answer for!).  But that's for *her* to wrestle with, not *you.*

Call her back and tell her that she's correct, you're not the right man for her; that it's sad, but the two of you clearly aren't compatible and you are breaking up with her.  And then YOU SAY GOOD-BYE AND HANG UP THE PHONE.  You don't get sucked into discussions about whether you're ""allowed"" to break-up with her, you don't start arguing about who's at fault, or start comforting her when she starts to cry and wail that this isn't what she meant!  (Spoiler:  she'll spill the beans about you fighting for her around this time.)

Je repete:  You make your announcement and then you hang up.  You won't even need an entire minute to do this.

And then you BLOCK HER EVERYWHERE.  Actually, you block her on all social media just before you call her, and then finish the process with your phone immediately after you hang up.  Now, call your friends and family and let them know about the break-up and give them a head's up that your ex might call them as a work-around to the blocking.  Tell them it's okay to just say, ""Who dis?"" and refuse to engage.

I do feel bad for your ex, despite everything.  Her maturation into full adulthood is going to be *rough.*  But you know what?  Not.  Your.  Problem.

Break up.  Block.  Move on with your life."

"I have a similar situation, I was adopted and my mom who adopted me stopped me from all contact from my biological mothers side of the family. Fast forward to me being 24 and in the army, I searched my name given to me at birth and found a message on ancestry. It’s a wild ride but I would say to follow your heart, your mom doesn’t seem to have it together and was selfish(my mom had done it out of fear, thinking I would up and leave for my bio family, and I totally forgive her for that), I love that you are experiencing love and your dad’s side of the family get to experience having you around. You deserve to get more aquatinted with all them, and just take it day by day. Live you’re beautiful life. "
Please tell me you got insurance on the trip
"I'm so sorry you missed knowing your father and that side of your family.    You should post this on the subreddit raised by narcissists.  However, I do wonder how your mother was able to get away with this legally, since it seems like he tried to fight this in court.  "
"You love the idea of a girl who possesses the qualities this one has, and also doesn’t view you as a paycheck.

"Hi, thanks for your reply. I would like to try and understand, why am I just a toy to him though? I know I can't trust a word he says 

&amp;#x200B;

Why is he doing this, do you think? I'm nothing, I'm a horrible pos. Why do they keep someone around like that, when they seemingly have no use for them? When they're useless and unimportant? I don't get it."
ill look into that. thank you :)

"Please, I’d like to be 5’9” and a supermodel, but it was never going to happen!

People should base who pays what on the basis of percentages. Our daughter dated a guy who made 70% more than she did, so they split everything 70/30. 

How can women be equal (financially) otherwise?"
If it were me I wouldn't even bring up the dick pic. Just ask if he's okay being comfortable nude around your friends who are also nude. Don't even bring up for a second the penis issue. 
"Female here. For what it is worth, if a man and a woman BOTH like this kind of set up, I don’t see what’s wrong with it. There are lots of different couples, we shouldn’t bash couples who are “traditionalists” that equally want things to be that way. Just my two cents. And yes, it should have been equal from the start. But some people like this set up. I’m not one of them, but I will stand up for couples that want to live this lifestyle. It’s okay. Women can be stay at home moms/homemakers if they want. They can be career gals, where their spouse is also a career person, or perhaps THEY stay at home. Literally, the possibilities are endless. And it’s okay. 

Here’s kind of a dumb comparison - pizza traditionally never had anything on it besides  cheese and sauce. It would be horrible if everyone could only ever have cheese and no other toppings. Does that mean that cheese pizza is NEVER okay? I don’t think so. "
"It kind of sounds like he's just not that into you, both physically and emotionally. I would never be in a relationship like that. I guess it really comes down to how much you really want to be with this guy."
"I think he knows.  I'm in my late 50's and have dated younger men, as in 20's and 30's.  It's kind of common knowledge that you may have a connection and like each other but this isn't a ""we're in it for the long haul"" situation.  I mean anything COULD happen, but the two of you are not in love, just like, right?  You're treating each other nicely, but you aren't a real couple.  He's coasting along with it.  He's not trying to advance the relationship, right?  Not meeting his family?  Holidays with them?  Future talk?  He's happy with some sex, a movie and a burger and a little talking here and there but no deep soul connection.  

If you really feel the need to actually spell it out, you could say something along the lines of ""Someday when you're married ...""  or ""someday you'll meet a woman ..."" type remarks."
I think sex is a big part of a relationship.  If it's not up to your standards find someone else.  
"You're still young. This is the time to enjoy a career like this. If you were 35 it might be a problem and someone might ask ""when are you gonna settle down?""

&amp;#x200B;

If she's not cool with it, so be it. I don't think someone at nine months should be pressuring you to get out of something you clearly are being smart and successful about."
"Send her some information on the Women’s Movement.  

“Equality isn’t just about having your cake.  Sometimes you’ve got to eat the check too.”"
Yes to everything everyone is saying. And beyond that it's super messed up that she thinks you need to be prioritizing her above any of your needs. You can't buy clothing unless you have money left over after paying for all of her needs? That's not someone who cares about your wellbeing.
"If someone is super self-conscious about their height/size in general, it’s reasonable to not want to date someone next to whom such things would be exaggerated. "
"&gt;But would rather go home early if there’s nothing to do. As do i. 

The difference is I’m guessing Lily had the guts to ask permission to do so, whereas you did not. Her being bold enough to for what she wanted should be a lesson to you — if you want something, ask for it. "
"I do have to say this could be cultural as well. Everyone I know around my age includes the man paying for outings in a relationship. It comes out of the joint account (where both partners contribute to) after marriage only. 

I've paid for concerts and comedy shows that I've wanted to go to and to bring my partner along with me. He pays for all of our restaurant outings "
"I think even if he isn't self concious, his girlfriend coming to him and saying ""Hey I know this is on your bucket list of things to do before you die, but I've seen my friends schlong and its way superior you sure you wanna do this?""

Will probably trigger some level of insecurity"
"We like each other a lot and we're a good fit, but I feel like we're overworked from working and college classes and we expect each other to deal with our daily frustrations."
"He's implying that I need to be more assertive and not ""be a bitch who cried to Reddit instead of dealing with his own problems directly""

I can't say that I fault him but his reasoning is actually backwards.

It's the very fact that I'm a 6'2"" former college rugby player that makes me wonder that maybe she just has it in her mind that I'm invincible.  A lot of why I've put up with these casual annoyance are just that, they are casual annoyances.  The real issue here for me is 100% her reaction when I tell her I don't like it."
"Dude, it's not gonna change. She's told you what she wants, she'd spend any money she earns on herself (though I'm not convinced she'd actually stick with the job too long anyway, probably run to mummy and daddy crying about it), and still expect everything from you. She just wants a sugar daddy. She doesn't even want to talk face-to-face, sounds like she doesn't take this relationship seriously. Go find someone who will be an equal partner with you."
This is why women get paid. 75 to the dollar compared to men.

"Time to bounce! Respectfully, break things off and tell her you simply aren't the guy she's looking for because of your profession. That will show her that it's not just a thing you're doing now. If she comes back begging you to take her back you can shoot for round 2 and it will be a 50/50 chance if she doesn't go back to wanting you to stop. The 100% safe move for you to do is to walk away.

"The exact opposite of this is true, open adoptions are the norm for domestic infant adoption and are only growing in terms of how commonplace they are. Closed adoptions are much less common than they used to be because children generally benefit from the continued contact with their biological families. 

According to adoptioninstitute.org, only 5% of US adoptions are closed now. "
Wasnt sure what the rules where on profanity. I changed it. Relax. 
"23 and still supported by her parents? Yikes.

One of the biggest annoyances with my failed LTR was that she went straight from living with parents to living with me. Never been independent. Dont make that mistake. You deserve a grownup."
"This is breaking my heart to read, OP. My mom did this all throughout my teenage years. She always made fun of me (and other people, but mostly me) about my weight. She did a lot of other things too, and when I finally got the nerve to ask her why she always was on me about my weight (5’4” and 120lbs), she said, just as cool as a cucumber. “I’m surprised you never had an eating disorder.” She had zero cares to give about how I felt about anything. I don’t mind telling you that I haven’t spoken with her more than once or twice in almost 18 years; I went no contact with her after my son was born. I realized that I didn’t want her to ever say any of the things she had said to me growing up. I wish I had been as protective of myself, or that literally ANY adult in my life would have wanted to protect me. 

Your dad is an enabler of your mother’s behavior, and go a certain extent, so are your grandparents. Your mom sounds like she might have some narcissistic traits. There is a subreddit, r/raisedbynarcissists, where people come to discuss their experiences and gain support. I invite you to come over and take a look. Unfortunately, Narc parents are not that uncommon, but they are very much alike in their behavior. 

If you don’t want to go back to your mom’s house, and have the opportunity to stay with your grandparents, I hope you will. Your mom does not seem ready to acknowledge how harmful and inappropriate her behavior is, and nothing will change unless and until she does. Your dad needs to understand that he had enabled this to continue, and he needs to take a much more active role in your care. That might mean protecting you, his daughter, from his wife. 

I wish you all the best, OP. "
Is she making more than 70k a year? If not flip the script and tell her you find her lack of motivation to bring in a reasonable income in concerning. 
That situation still seems balanced. I’m more than reasonable but our relationship is not similar to that.
Probably an accurate assessment.
You’re right.
[removed]
You're right. It just sucks to put so much into people and not have it reciprocated. 
I was looking for any outside perspective to see if perhaps I was overreacting. More than anything I wanted to vent as well. It’s hard dealing with relationship problems when you don’t really have anyone to talk about it with.
It means you shouldn't be talking to your ex
" ""(as of now, bf has no idea I am on super friendly terms with Nex""

Are you kidding? Take some ownership over what you're doing this feigned ignorance is ridiculous."
"Confront her. She probably still thinks of you as a child. Prove otherwise. Sometimes my mum asks me if i need to go to the toilet before we leave, i just say ""mum im 27 now, so its really none of your business""

But on that note im gonna call my mum and see how she's doing."
What are you getting that from? Open adoption is generally strongly recommended by professionals unless there are safety issues or bioparents are strongly opposed to contact. It's considered much healthier for children.
"Whether she has been influenced her friends/family that she's talked to about it, or this is something she came to decide on her own,she isn't taking what you consider your profession as a serious thing. I guess it's for you to decide if it's worth it to talk to her again about it and make it very clear that this is something you intend on continuing as your career. It sounds like she's already shared her thoughts on it though, and if her friends and family aren't supportive of what you're doing even if you stay together it's going to be an uphill battle. "
"I think she genuinely felt bad for me because I was upset about the whole thing.  My family dislikes her so she kinda threw that back in my face.  It's different because she was rude to my mom one time.  I've always been super nice and cool with her family.  Maybe her family has a more hostile attitude towards me because they are very Christian and I am not really religious. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what prompted him to say it.  I'm trying to look at it through his perspective.  He probably loves his granddaughter and wants whats best for her.  Maybe he thinks that she needs to be with someone more culturally compatible.  I wouldn't mind quitting pot to appease her and her parents but alcohol and Jesus are non negotiable issues with me."
Can’t take this seriously if you’re afraid to spell the word sex 
"Honestly, who gives a shit how she feels about it? She's an abuser, and OP should get out regardless. The grandpa's dying declaration is irrelevant here. "
"Suggest the alternative, you find a nice cosy 1 bed together and split the rent. You can get another lodger no problem, the house is an investment you made into your future which he has no right to the proceeds. Highlighting the fact that it will probably cost twice as much for him as your asking should help make you're point, you'll probably be no worse off as the new lodgers rent will cover your new rent then it's just him biting his nose off to spite his face.


Please note this is a negotiation tactic intended to make him either see sense or give you an insight into his character and if you want to spend your life with someone who feels entitled to what's yours.


It's not realistic because you almost certainly don't have a buy to let mortgage and must be living in the property to rent a room out legally. He won't know this though"
I’m sure she’d be happy to treat herself and have you treat her to.
"Sex is important, but not *that* important (in my opinion). He may just be comfortable with you and settled into a more comfortable place a bit. It is normal for frequency to decline once you've been together for some time. In order to really say where you're relationship is at, consider the other stuff - how is the not sex part of your relationship?"
Few weeks of feeling like a scumbag or several years of misery?
So... Has she EVER had a job or had to provide for herself? This is important context.
Sounds like an insecure loser and also sounds like you have other potential interested parties so I say leave. That kind of crap should never be tolerated. 
We do but it seems like I am the only individual that will attempt to contact them through it and I am sure they have their own that I am not in where they make plans that I don't know about.

"You don't get a job because you're qualified to do it, you get a job because you are the MOST qualified person who applies. 

Qualified isn't always enough."
"Stay with your grandparents as long as you can, and don't worry about apologizing to your mom or ""embarassing"" your family, she's the one that should feel embarrassed at her behavior. No one deserves to be put through that.  It made me so sad to read (both posts) and I can tell you, at almost 30 (same height and about the same weight as you)  I'm still getting past body image issues, and my experience wasn't even anywhere close to yours. Your grandparents seem like they're concerned with your health and wellbeing more than a number on the scale, and that's what is important. And if you can't stay with your grandparents, start fighting back against your mom, if she changes what you order, or tells you to order something else, don't let her. It's your body, not hers, and if you're comfortable with how you are (it's a long process, and getting past the 'not hating your body' is a big step) there's no reason to apologize or feel bad about that."
"Lol I would move on. If she got mad because you had to buy yourself work clothes and she got jealous over than that. Then shes pretty petty and her logic is rather bullshit. 

Sure 50/50 paying for things isn't really the issue here it's mainly she got mad in general because she wanted your money spent on her. 

Maybe it's good that it happened now before it got really serious.."
"Honestly if I was your boyfriend I'd consider this emotionally cheating. He's a bad friend and you're a bad girlfriend. Either tell your boyfriend the truth and cut your ""secret friend"" off, or break up with your boyfriend. You can't have both. Time to be an adult and stop being selfish and using people."
"There's bucket lists and there are bucket lists. There also how you saw that bucket list. Was it with friends? Hey Lets do a nude beach some time could very well mean lets go with a bunch of rando's. Not let's go with good friends. I'm comfortable with nudity, when it's time I'm the first to whip it out. But there is a difference for some people between random people, and friends. Hence the conversation. The I know the dick can be very diffrent from oh look at that dick over there. "

"It takes years to get to know someone, especially in these crucial years when people change DRASTICALLY from one year to the next and you frankly have no clue where you’ll be at compared to your “fiancé” you are still deep in the honeymoon period with. "
Agree 
Talk about high expectations = that's what it looks like to me. But don't forget if they didn't give a damn they wouldn't comment at all on anything. YOU have zero to apologize for but your parents have teenagers and THAT is difficult for just about EVERY parent. So keep that part in mind and try to forgive. 
"This is a good point. We never discussed where we stand on this and it might be a good thing to talk about. Another user mentioned that he didn’t tell me because he didn’t feel comfortable when I told him, whereas I told him because I didn’t want to feel like I was being negligent.

&amp;#x200B;

2) when he spews germs everywhere just get up and leave the room-go to dinner without him.

3) lock your door when you are in your room-get a door stopper if you dont have a lock-or an 'add an lock'

"dude giving your children an allowance into adulthood is really inappropriate. when i was in college i worked part time for spending money, i didn’t have it handed to me from my parents. sure my parents helped out with a lot, but you also need to teach your kids financial responsibility. 

that’s how someone develops and attitude like your girlfriend’s. “oh your spending money on new work clothes? uh that money should be spent on me, why am i still paying for dates?”

don’t make more people like her. "
"It does sound a bit like you are crossing a line. What's more though, is that you are stringing your boyfriend along. You admit to having not loved him for 2 years and that you guys have a lot of issues. It's not a matter of how wonderful of a person he is, it's about compatibility. I hate to say it but it sounds very much like you are using your boyfriend as a sort of treatment for your issues with dependency. He deserves the opportunity to pursue a relationship where both people are happy, and so do you. Instead of relying on him, I think it would be beneficial for you to talk to a professional for help.

Be responsible and finish with your boyfriend as it is 100% an emotional affair and you have checked out with him.

"Well BMI is a standard. It's based off a formula. They don't change depending on where you type the information. Did you type your information correctly? Because at 5'6'' it might put you as slightly overweight but not 5'9''. The ONLY other thing I can think of is if you are Asian, because cardiovascular problems start at a lower BMI for Asians than other ethnicities so the numbers are changed. 
Cut off for Normal weight for other ethnicities is 24.99 for Asians it is 22.99 
Your BMI (for the numbers you gave) are exactly 22.99, so if you were wearing shoes on the scale it could've tipped you over to 23, putting you at ""slightly overweight"" (for the Asian BMI at least). "

"I'm going to disagree with others saying there is nothing productive for being gained from a conversation about this.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm too am an aspiring academic completing a PhD, and it sounds like you and/or your wife might not fully understand how ludicrously competitive the academic job market is. [It's been likened to trying to become a professional NBA star](https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/09/how-do-professors-get-hired-the-academic-job-search-explained.html).  It's that competitive. The job market is especially grim for humanities fields. The chances that anyone, your wife and myself included, will get a tenure-track job is vanishingly small. People apply for dozens and dozens of jobs and move across the country to the one place they get an offer, if they get on at all. Even if she manages to claw her way into an academic position, it will likely take 3-6 years for a PhD, and another 2-5 years of post-doc positions before she gets one, if not longer. The post-doc down the hall for me has been looking for an academic job for 8 years. These positions do not pay well, and the work hour demands make balancing family life challenging.  She may need to move multiple times to different post-docs. Are you willing to move with her or be long distance? Women have babies in academia, but those women make sacrifices and have partners that make significant sacrifices for them as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not trying to be grim; I'm trying to be realistic. It's not to say that she shouldn't do a PhD or attempt to become a professor, but you both need to understand and discuss the sacrifices that will require. You need to have a plan for what will happen if (likely when) she does not get an academic job. It's fine to hope for the best, but plan for the worst. This will not be the last time you both will have to make a decision about sacrificing career or family goals because a grant, job application, tenure review, etc., was denied. You need to be on the same page about how you will make those decisions, preferably sooner rather than later."
I think if there's they want to do something and all of them are available and you are not that's absolutely fine. I think a friend group the schedule of the majority should always be considered more important than that of any one individual group member. You seem to expect romantic partner level of dedication from your friends when in reality a group of friends is just a bunch of people that get together when it's convenient and have fun together. 
"Nope you should not apologize, your mom should and learn to be a better parent.

Baby girl, if I was you, I would stay far away from her and live with your grandparents. Because living with that toxicity will harm you more and cause you more damage health wisw. You need to heal and living with this narcissistic woman will not help you.

You are a beautiful girl and never forget this."
"I 100% see why she annoys the crap out of you, and I would agree that her boundaries are hazy at best... but I don’t know if I think she’s really THE problem. The problem is your boyfriend not saying: gtfo of my room until I’m dressed... deciding to live with someone he used to have a big thing for: dumbass move. 

I think he probably enjoys the attention somewhat, and at this point because he lives with her he has some fear about going against her and making a thing out of it. "
"you talk as if the wife is likely to agree to an open marriage.  non-monogamy isn’t a bad thing so long as it’s consensual for all parties (OP’s situation is not), but most people aren’t going to be down.  that’s especially considering the fact that the wife can’t emotionally deal with a threesome."
"Agreed. And I happily would have sexed his brains out, but he rebuffed all of my advances, before announcing he was ""tired"" and sulking off to bed. Continuing to try to engage seemed like the wrong thing to do, considering how he shut me down earlier. "

She sounds like she's looking for a way out dude. Or looking for a sugar daddy. She has a lot of growing up to do... jump ship.
"It shows that you're an honest trustworthy person just by the fact that you're bothered incase others would see this as a red flag, instead of not caring about what other guys may think. You had your reasons for why you cheated, but you weren't doing that to someone who truly loved and cared for you when he treated you in that way, and the right guy should understand this. "
"&gt; Has she tried to isolate you from your other friends/family/coworkers? Has she made you drop hobbies to spend more time with her?

I have spent a number of weekends in my apartment with her because she didn't want us to go out with my friends.
"
I certainly never said that! This guy is behaving like a real piece of shit practicing nonethical nonmonogamy i.e. cheating. He should leave his wife and find partners who are willing to share.
That's not cool dude; a healthy relationship shouldn't be like that. Looking forward to the update after ya'll talk.
"All you can do is be there for her. Don’t give up on her. It’s a tough thing, but like others have said in the end she has to want to get better. Take it from someone who waited 29 years to figure that out. Hope things get better for her. "
"If you are paying rent, food, buying cars, and most critically, *filing taxes* declaring this as income, you are 100% legit.  Don't forget payroll taxes, like unemployment insurance and disability!

&gt; Over the last 5 years i have made (profit) about 70k a year on average.

Intermediate poker player here.  I am also a statistician who has testified in court about statistical issues.  You have demonstrated a solid record by any measure.  If you have mid-high five figures in a bankroll, you are 100% legitimate as a self-employed business person, and I'm willing to give at least even odds that you are doing that already (if not, learn or pay somebody!)

Girlfriend needs to understand that you are a business.  She needs to remember that you going to the casino is what enables you to eat, live, pay taxes, and give to the universe.  She needs to always remember that you putting together your sports betting is not 'a fun time', but as serious of work as I am when I'm reviewing a stack of employee data for my legal clients.

Some joking around is acceptable, just like in any career.  But when the rubber hits the road, she has to respect what you do.  And if she doesn't, then, pardon the reference, one of you has to fold your hand."
This isn’t super uncommon but most of the time it’s the guy insisting on paying for everything. It’s outdated either way but possible she has only been with guys who act this way since she is quite young. Or she doesn’t make enough money to justify going out often at all even if it’s just paying for herself 
"Me too buddy, me too. And maybe a unicorn too, while we're dreaming."
Tell her to give you all of her salary to you and then you'll pay everything for her. Otherwise get out of that relationship asap. 
I didn’t read any of the other comments but this is a huuuuge red flag to me. I always split things 50/50 with my man.  I would never expect him to pay for everything..
"You're underreacting. I'm a little concerned that you're absorbing a lot of verbal abuse and crazymaking behavior and, instead of fleeing for the exits, are wondering if you're overreacting and worrying about ""us""."
"Yes...they both have day jobs which contribute equal amounts to their joint finances, so the point that she has a day job is moot. I'm talking strictly in the context of this side gig..."
"This is not okay. This is pretty fucking ass-backward. Let her go find a sugar daddy. A partnership, a relationship isn't just 50/50, it's 100/100. If she's not even willing to do 50/50, then she's got a problem. What does she think would happen if you guys got married? Would she just quit working? Would her money be hers and your money be ""both of yours""? Fuck that noise. As a woman, I'm insulted and incensed about this sort of twattery. "

"Are you kidding?!?!! You get to supply all the money AND do all the housework? She’s looking for a very nice deal. It won’t work, of course, but it would be fun to demand the wifey role from her and see how she reacts. "
op doesn't seem happy with paying for everything . the girlfriend seems abusive in her request and how she couldnt even tell him to his face but rather via text. if a a couple chooses to divide duties in a specific way that's fine.. but that's not whats happening.. so your point in not relevant rn.
"I'm not considering cheating as an option just to clarify. 
But yeh that's what I was thinking."
You’ll regret it if you never ask. 
"Well then you’re making the wrong assumption. Sure that’s the origin of the whole “gender narrative”, but all I’m saying is if both partners prefer it that way, what’s the problem? Should a couple be unhappy for the sake of not conforming to the “gender narrative”? Pretty dumb if you ask me."
You should have had their love for many years. Don’t waste one more minute of their love thinking about her. She will never see her wrongdoing and she will never apologize. Move on with the family you should have had all along.
Damn can her parents hook me up with allowance too
"This could be a sign of a mental health issue. Bipolar runs in my family. Not saying this exact situation means that, but I have noticed flips of personality and irrational decision making from my mom the last few years, when most of my life before that she was quite normal. It seems a switch flipped and she's getting worse still because she is ignorant of her problems. It's sad and I wish you the best. Definitely talk to her about it, but if you get any sign that she is going to expect this the rest of your life...GTFO "
"Lol 

Just. 

You know what? Go where she wants. 
Make it easy on yourself."
"You took an action you regret and regard as a mistake. You've grown and learned from it. There is no need to castigate yourself over it anymore, nor to disclose it as if you have an STD. It's not some scarlet letter pinned to your chest that brands you as a Bad Person for the rest of your days. It's a complete non-issue."
"If he's going to ro be living there and using all the amenities, then yes, he should pay! Why the fuck shouldn't he?
I mean, if you two ever moved in to a place without anyone else, he'd have to help with the bills. He's being idotic and immature. He needs to either pull his bloody great head in, or go back to live with his mummy and daddy!

I know both of you are still young, but please feel free to find a real man. He isn't it. You can do better, trust me."
"As others have mentioned, try to talk to the family first. Otherwise, you could contact his college if he is a student or see if your county has a crisis team. It's hard to force people to get help."
"If y'all end up in the same area for college, you should go for it. Learn to take some risks. But if y'all move far apart, it's tough being in college and LDR"
"Because it's been on my mind for a while and concerns me. It'd be nice to get peoples opinions on whether or not I screwed myself over, so I can know what to expect. "
Sounds like he doesn’t care about your feelings. 
Dude. Fucking run. Fast and hard.
"Hey thanks for that wildly original “You must have stepped off the time machine”...quip. It’s not like that hasn’t been used thousands of times. 

There is no point in having children you have no interest in raising for at least a few years. Babies need someone who loves them with their whole heart raising them for at least the first few years. I assure you daycare workers do not love your children. (I know because I’ve worked at a couple myself) 
"
"That's...assault.  Over something stupid.  If you'd done that to her and she called the cops, you might be sitting in a jail cell right now.  

Be careful, OP.  That's a slippery slope.  "
I smoke an oz and a half a week :(
"They deserve each other, they are both extremely petty and bad at communication.

Whatever the opposite of a 'go getter' is how I would describe them. Complacent. Obsequious. Sheep-like.
"
Thankyou!
Do you guys live in an area that's particularly bad for jobs? Because a year is a long time to be hunting in the current job market. The unemployment rate is super low. Is your boyfriend actually qualified for the positions he's seeking? Do you think he does poorly at interviews? Does his resume look like crap? Because something doesn't add up here.
I think I need that. I haven't given myself any time at all.
Honestly sounds like someone is putting poison in her ear if this behavior is so new and unheard of from her. Does she have friends or idols that live this sort of lavish lifestyle?
Tell her you expect her to do all the cleaning and cooking. I don’t think she’ll like that either.
It really sounds to me like she’s not invested in this relationship at all. Sounds like she wants out but doesn’t wanna do the dirty work of breaking up with you. Instead she’s gonna use you until you get fed up and break up with her. Just my opinion of course.
