I would definitely not bring it up. If he asks tell the truth though. 
"Yea, they are right you are wrong.

"It sounds like your real problem is that you've been relatively passive in your romantic life in general, and are now feeling 'behind' in that you don't have a long-term girlfriend lined up for the marriage track. It's completely normal to want to settle down and be in a committed, lifelong relationship... and also normal to realize that finding and building that connection is a heck of a lot of *work*. But if you want that relationship, you've got to be willing to put in the work for it.

There are *loads* of late-20s early-30s women who are in your exact same place, ready to settle down and start families but lacking the partner to do it with. Do some research into dating services and start reaching out to people. I highly recommend Dr. Nerdlove's blog for advice on dating."
"Make sure your mother apologizes first! I’ve dealt with similar issues with my own mother and it took me a long time to stand up for myself, but when I did I felt the most relief I had ever experienced in my life. You deserve an apology from her as the way she has been treating you is awful. As painful as it can be stand up for yourself!! Best of luck and keep your head up. "
"I moved in with my partner into a house that has his name on the mortgage.  He (very graciously) did not charge me rent for the first three months because I was studying for the bar exam, had no income, and was still paying the rent on my old apartment.

When I started earning a salary, he started to charge me rent.  We have a lease agreement that states: (1) how much I pay, (2) that he is responsible for repairs and other usual landlord duties, and (3) that I do not own a stake in the house just because my rent goes to his mortgage.  My rent is below market price (it's about half of the mortgage and bills).  We both think the deal is reasonable.

When someone asked me whether I thought it was fair that I was helping him pay his mortgage, I pointed out that the alternative was to help another person pay their mortgage (and probably a higher percentage of that mortgage).  When I've saved enough money for a down payment on a house, then I can think about owning property.

&amp;#x200B;"
Did I say illegal? No. I’m sure your higher ups will really agree with that and sympathize with you. /s
"If someone is bad for you, stop dealing with them. Avoid them, don't waste your time thinking about them, and certainly don't bother providing them with any explanation for your actions. Communication with people who are bad for you always makes you feel even worse.

Your family are bad for you. They probably don't have bad intentions and they may not actually be bad people, but they're bad for *you*. Cut them off and don't look back."
"Are you sure they actually think you would attempt suicide again, or is that possibly just a way for them to keep tabs on you? And make you feel guilty for not staying in contact. Sounds like your mom was at the very least a child abusing monster. You owe her nothing. You SURVIVED her!! My advice is to change your number for the last time. And enjoy the life God gave you, in spite of your mother's attempts to destroy it . "
"Holy shit dude, you don't need any of those people in your life.
You made the right decision going NC and don't let anyone make you doubt that. Change your phone number and keep going with your life. Best of luck. "
There's no reason to keep people who make us unhappy in our lives just because they're family.
I’m curious what exactly she gets up to all day. 
"He just doesn’t have the experience. Absolutely the skills, but he didn’t do any internships or work through college, and now he feels trapped at this temp job and I think that shines through. 

I’ll offer help on things and he’s grateful but then is defensive when I have edits — which I get, it’s a pride thing, but come on. 

Thank you :)"

"He definitely should, he's going to be causing the bills to go up by doing extra things you wouldn't do so it should be his responsibility to help pay for them.
"
"I hug, kiss, say it, sing it, breakfast in bed on the weekends, foot rubs, back rubs, favorite foods, roses, etc etc it goes on. "
What happens when you do talk to him about it? 
No offence but you dodged a bullet here. 
I just hold on to how it was the first year. How it felt. We did it so much. But now I feel more like a part of his décor to the house than an individual person sometimes. I've tried talking to him about it but he never has much to say or he stares at me blankly. 
"Why would him carrying my stuff around means he wants to fuck me ? He made it clear multiples times that he wasn't attracted to me. 

Also, I just enjoy his company, because I have fun when we bicker, how does that make me an attention seeker? Am I not allowed to have friends of the opposite sex? "

"Yes, it sounds like OP is jealous about a lot of things about his wife but his wife having these things does not stop OP from having them. Also, it may seem like wife just “has” these things but she no doubt worked hrd for them. Friends and family take relationship maintenance; does op not have friends because he does not put in the effort to maintain friendships? Also, he has a younger son, which is going to take up more time parenting than an adult son. 

Basically OP needs to make some effort to improve certain aspects of his life. And take responsibility. Reach out to some of that estranged family. Ask a work friend out for an after work drink. "
"Completely unacceptable. As a child if I asked my mom to pass me my keys from my backpack, she always brought the entire backpack, because it was not okay for her to go through my personal stuff, and she taught me to treat her stuff with the same respect. Invading personal space is never okay."
Not a lot of reaction and just a blank stare. I don't know if something is wrong and he can't communicate it? I know sometimes he becomes flaccid out of no where so maybe he is self conscious about that? But it doesn't explain why we only do it when he wants it...
"Don’t eat your hat. I’m sure it’s a nice hat. Because it’s highly likely, eat an Oreo lol!"
"Yep, learned that one the hard way."
"Oh Hon, I am so sorry for everything you have had to go through with your mother.  You don't need to apologize for anything.  It sounds like your mother puts you in constant no win situations.  If you talk you annoy them, if you don't talk you annoy them.  If you speak when demanded you are wrong. The only one who should be apologizing here is your mother.  You didn't embarrass your family, if anyone did it was her treating you like that, calling you names in front of your family and restaurant staff.  I don't know if it is possible, but do you think you could live with your grandparents for a bit?  They seem supportive of you and kind."
I agree - keeping a person from sleeping is a classic abuse tactic.  I'm really disturbed by this whole toxic dynamic.  I hope they don't have kids.
She was getting raw dogged by multiple guys while seeing you. That should’ve been the end of it right there. She doesn’t seem to care how you feel about things and will likely continue doing whatever she wants. I wouldn’t be surprised if she’s still talking to him regularly and is just better at hiding it from you now. 
Your comment reminds me of the post from the lady whose boyfriend wouldn't even pick her up medicine when she had bronchitis.... and he had her credit card and lived in the same house.  
"I realized that I made the post too long, and I didn't want it to be about me. I failed to mention the aftermath of things. Yes, I did suffer a lot and was clearly emotionally abused and it affected me in other areas, but I also learned the value of making mistakes, standing up for myself, and finally giving the other person a chance. I have a great relationship with my mother. We live together, and she insists on helping me out financially while I'm in grad school. We have more a roommate relationship than anything, and I'm mostly glad to be home to help her around. I'm living with her because I want to. She's been going through a lot lately, and I am saving a ton of money this way. The teenage years were hard especially because I took everything personally. That's all I really wanted the OP to take from my post: Try and give the other person a chance. 

Yes my mom was tough, and sometimes said things that were really hurtful, and she absolutely humiliated me a couple of times in public no less... but ultimately, I know it was coming from a loving place. Misguided, mishandled; but never sinister. And I only found that out because instead of running from her, I decided to trust in myself being adult enough to have an adult conversation with her. What's ended up happening to our relationship is that she no longer shares her opinions about me with me. I live my life, and sometimes ask for her advice and she lives hers and sometimes comes to me for help. 

Also, I'm hoping that OP sees this and realizes that it could work out and someday she might have an amazing relationship with her mom. I made the mistake of distancing myself from her for years. 

&gt; idealistically

i completely agree. I am being optimistic and choosing to see the good in people. I honestly would want others to give me a chance if someday I end up fucking up. All I'm encouraging her to do is to try this. 

&gt;Reaching out to her and trying to get her to understand can be done while you live in a place where people don't abuse you constantly.

Yes, which is why I never told her to move back. She could live with her grandparents, but still have a relationship with her mom. In an ideal situation, they make up and work on this on their own. But trust me, if it's all toxic then it is necessary that she gets out soon. There's a teenage youtuber I watch sometimes, and her mother is absolutely awful and nobody seems to notice. Her videos are honestly sometimes hard to watch because of that. The number of times the mother reminds her kid that she's raising her and feeding her - as if she's doing her a favor - to guilt her into sth, telling her she doesn't need her, threatening to move out and leave the kid, etc is just tragic. That girl needs to get out the second she is 18, and I can't wait for her to leave that toxic enviornment behind. "
Fact thanks
"OP, it sounds like your grandfather should involve an outsider, like a lawyer, who could be a messenger/middleman between you and your sister. You'll have to communicate to share the responsibility and that can't happen if you hurt eachother. Then the job of being your mother's financial POA will be easier to deal with. I'm not sure about the roles and specific (legal) responsibilities, but it sounds like there's a third party needed to work with you all. There are some constructions for this. It's not cheap, but that is one way to keep your bio mom safe. It would also protect the transparancy of your roles, when those are going to cause problems. 

With big trauma come a lot of tears. Sometimes it indeed doesn't work. In that case, there's no shame in saying that you cannot properly care for your mother. You'll have to protect you first. But if you are going to try, at least seek someone who can offer you some validation and help you find some coping skills for specific situations. So you're not alone when it becomes a 'this too shall pass'- phase.

Appreciate that
Even if you did go I have a feeling they would've put you down for not making up with her before she died. At least in this case you stood by what you wanted to do instead of giving into that feeling of obligation. There is no shame in not wanting anything to do with an abuser or put yourself through anything uncomfortable or painful.
"&gt;If you subsidize this hateful nonsense, you will in effect be paying people to abuse your son.

Please pay attention to this, OP! Sending him to ""conversion therapy"" will more than likely make your son even more suicidal. I would highly suggest getting him a therapist (licensed, legit, and compassionate) who is familiar with LGBTQIA issues. You can also seek help from other, local LGBTQIA organizations, suicide prevention organizations, as well as the Trevor Project ([https://www.thetrevorproject.org](https://www.thetrevorproject.org)). Please, get him help ASAP! If he says he's suicidal over this, believe him! Get him help! "
"You’re not insane in any way, everything you’re upset about is completely valid, and you should 1000% dump him. "
Definitely get him some therapy ... but not the conversion type.

Yeah I would just break up with her. I have before for similar reasons. 
r/narcissisticparents
"It sounds like you're not satisfied with how your life has turned out, which is fine. But then you started looking at your wife's life with envy and seem like you're displacing all those negative feelings on her, which is not fine.

It's not your wife's fault your friends don't invite you out for drinks. It's not her fault your friends don't go on trips with you. Etc. If you want those things to change, you have to change them yourself. You have too many Mormon friends? You need to make new friends like your wife did who won't shun you for being Mormon. You need more vacation time? You need to advocate for it at your current job, or find a different job with better benefits. You want to take vacations without your wife? Then do so. None of this is because of your wife, so don't be resentful to her about it. "
"Right. You sound like a wonderful dog owner to a high-energy dog. So considering you can give (and are giving) everything your dog everything it needs by yourself, and your boyfriend is irresponsible and combative when it comes to matters of your dog and downright disrespectful and mean when it comes to your injury and needs, it seems you should lose the boyfriend and keep the dog. "
"Clicking into this question I thought to myself ""Even if you hated her, you should have went for the sake of appearances"" but I'm glad you didn't go. She abused you, made your life Hell and she does not deserve your time. 

If you were abused for years and they didn't believe you or take you seriously (maybe they discounted you because you were bipolar?) than there's nothing you can do with these people. If your own sister, someone who lived through this woman with you, doesn't even believe you than I think you should cut contact. These people didn't care about you when you were being abused and they're not exactly going to change their ways since your mother is dead and, therefore, eternally more a victim than you in their eyes. 

These people have made their decision to support an abuser and they do not deserve your time or effort. Change your number, block them on social media, move and change you name even. 

Maybe try to connect with your biological father and start a familiar connection there but that's another subject entirely. 

&amp;#x200B;"
"What a heartbreaking situation. To be honest, I think you're in a position where all you can do is choose the lesser of two evils. All the ""therapy"" is going to do is deepen the self hatred and cognitive dissonance he is experiencing, possibly introduce even more issues, and make it that much harder for him to move on from these harmful ideas. I think you will just have to refuse to pay but try to keep lines of communication open so you can be a positive influence on his life. "
"*MISSED INFO* - Please note, I have zero issue with her partying with her friends or taking a long time to send a text. In no way do I ever want her to not have fun. But when the only text you get after 7 hours is “I’m safe” and there being no balance between being able to do things with your partner (I’ve tried for a year) and with your friends (she’s gone out over 5 times in the last 2 weeks), it really makes me upset and question a lot. "
I understand all of this....but I have a strict rules against discussing my marriage with anyone but my husband. I would never say anything negetive about him or our relationship outside of just us and I think that causes me to need to talk about things with him as they happen because I don't have anyone else I can talk to. 
"Conversion therapy doesn't even work, so you'd be throwing money down the drain. I'm sorry this is happening, OP."

"She felt insulted by your boyfriend because he told her to sit the fuck down and act like an adult in a moving car?

"can you talk to him and basically say - ""i think it's awesome you're pursuing standup, but lately i feel like you're testing material and a persona out on me and i kinda miss just being able to chat with you like before. i'm always happy to hear from you about how your standup's going, or maybe if you have bits you want to test out on me you can let me know and i can give you my feedback if you want! but can we also make sure we block out time to just hang out like old times?"""
"Sadly it seems to be the flashy markings/looks of herding and working breeds that lures people in and then they don't do nearly enough with the dogs (socializing, exercising, training) to make them a steady well adjusted adult dog and you have all these reactive dogs going at each other due to shitty owners that then make the rest of the breeds and other 20 something year olds look bad. Walking a german shepherd for 10 minutes around the block and doing nothing else with it is just asking for a reactive, 100lb+ dog that neither of them will cope with."
"Yes, thank you. I understand. Some people are saying I am a moron or that I should give up my dog away immediately because of my BF. To be honest, I'd rather dump him if it's as serious as this, as I am realizing this is a bad sign for our future... "
"Maybe my perspective is a little warped, being in a same-sex relationship (in which being ""forbidden"" from hanging out with other women would just be stupid), but it seems silly to me to distinguish who your significant other is allowed to keep company with based on their gender. If this is the person you plan on spending your life with, you should be able to trust them enough to be alone with other people, right?

That being said, you're entitled to your opinion regardless of whether or not I agree with it! "
"How is my puppy suffering? Did you read my post? She is far from neglected. She receives in fact more exercise than she should be getting, I was told by some. I train her myself and she is starting obedience training at a school at the 5 month mark. She is very well cared for. The problem is my BF who won't share responsibilities, and it is frustrating because what I thought would be a shared responsibility has fallen onto my shoulders. Even so, I can handle it all myself, but it is making me see my BF in another eyes--that he is undervaluing me and what I do and then refusing to do the little he should be doing. "
I think they both do.
"Maybe now that she knows you had/have feelings for her she likes the attention or is still kind of weighing on her mind, either way don't change your behavior and keep treating her as a friend. She rejected you so it's up to her to make a move if she is interested. I would probably take a step back from the friendship for a bit as well. "
Whoa. She will ask you what you want to do to meet new friends. What will you say that is not a game?
"Leave your niece and nephew an email you make up only for their use and monitor it. They can contact you via school computers if necessary.

Cut these other cancerous people out of your life."
"i think the more delicate you try to be, the worse it probably is...like not telling him you have an interview. he may be bitter at first, but it sounds like he's a good guy and is rooting for you as well. i would just be patient and understanding with him, as job hunting can be a soul sucking, demoralizing process, and any negativity he may initially show is not really about you.

side note - i see you mention he majored in math. im not sure what industries you guys are interested in, but if you're looking at tech and he is willing to work for a bit as an analyst, it can be a good foot in the door to other opportunities (project or product manangement, etc). feel free to PM me if you want any tips on this."
"When you guys are in a good mood and have time to talk, I would say something like, ""I wanted to let you know that when you got really drunk the other night, you told me about your eating disorder in high school. I just wanted to say that it doesn't change how I feel about you one bit, it's not going to change anything about our relationship, and you have all of my love and support. If you want to talk about it, or there's anything I can do to help you, please let me know.""

I think it's too much of a big (and serious) thing for you to know about and just pretend like you don't."
"I still think you should explain everything that has upset you to your mother, the way you have with us. She obviously doesn’t engage in the type of self reflection that would enable her to be aware of her actions already. 

Also, why would you need to wait the potato skins???? What are appetizers for???? Were you the only one who wasn’t allowed to eat them?"
"Get down girl, go 'head, get dow- 

He needs to tell her to get the f- out. I could never imagine to my bf that he should pay for everything.

Granted, it would be hilarious if OP continues the relationship to point out the number of calories in her meal (""maybe you should get a salad instead"") or getting snacks at an event (""you really think you should be eating movie theater popcorn?"") she see how much she likes ""traditional gender roles"""
"Sounds like he’s using you for sex. Even if not though, I would be very cautious to get into a relationship with someone who ended things with you like that. What you said about the breakup oozes of disrespect and selfishness. I wouldn’t be shocked if he shows emotionally abusive characteristics down the line tbh. IMO you should stay away OP, and be the one to cut this off so you’re not left standing in a nightgown wondering what the fuck to do with your shit again. Good luck OP"

You can care about B but explain to him that you care but you can't be around while he is active in that behavior. It doesn't make you a bad friend but you need to set healthy boundaries for yourself. It's so easy to get caught up in things after being around them long enough. B may be upset at the time but when he comes to his senses he will understand. 
"That was pretty hard to read. I have raised teenage girls and am very impressed that your daughter came to you with her needs like that, that took bravery and emotional intelligence to do. 

You dismissed her, and then when you felt bad you came to her room and demanded attention from her. That was like a double whammy of ""what not to do when my teenager actually talks to me about something bothering them.""

Words won't fix this. Showing up will. Show an interest in her life - even if it's very boring to you to listen to her talk about what is going on in her life. Closeness to teenagers isn't about offering sage advice for their big problems, it's about listening to their every day minutia and really listening so you can see how they think. "
"Your OP does sound like that. I'm with a gregarious, social partner who calls people ""love"" or whatever and I find it delightful; perhaps you two could work through your differences with a professional so you take pleasure in each other's quirks/strengths. Good luck!"
"I'm about your mother's age, and she really sounds horrible.   It was completely off-base for her to embarrass you like that in front of your family and strangers, then to blame you for being upset about it, then to complain about you not ""respecting her"" enough.  Respect is something earned, and certainly a two-way street.   She's not showing any respect for you as a person and demanding that you just shut up and take it.

Honestly, if you can stay with your grandparents, you might as well tell her you'd be happy to show her more respect when she decides to stop belittling you, embarrassing you, and completely disrespecting you. "
"Dude no, you were broken up when you made your Tinder, so you did nothing wrong. It wasn't great that you lied about it, but given her reaction I understand, and it's honestly not her business who you're with when you guys are not together. She seems like she's going through some stuff, but her trust issues are hers alone. It's for the best that you've broken up. Let her come to terms with her own insecurities because your white lie about using Tinder when you were single doesn't warrant the panic she seems to feel about you leaving her. 

TL;DNR: Don't chase her. Focus on yourself and finding someone without as many insecurities and trust issues."
"Thank you, I just wasn’t sure if I was dumb for feeling the way I did it questioning the way she’s acted. Clearly I have every right to feel like this, but she will never understand it. I’ll definitely  do an update post."
"NOOOOOO don't let him""prove himself"" to you!!! Cheaters are the BEST actors!! They'll be on their bestest behavior until they notice you're no longer looking as hard, and they will start doing it again!

This is supposed to be your HONEYMOON phase!! He is supposed to be googly eyed over you and no other woman could take his attention. That's obviously not happening. Please tell us you left him and are not looking back."
"OP, your mother sounds abusive. Consider checking out r/justnofamily and r/raisedbynarcissists if you haven’t already, as well as asking your grandparents if you can live with them instead, because your mother clearly doesn’t care about your feelings, or anyone else’s, for that matter. Stay safe, OP. ❤️"
"So she’ll go out with other people, but decline the same activity when you try to make plans? And you’re not allowed to tag along when she goes out with others?

It’s not mental health issues that are making you feel bad, it’s her lack of respect for you and poor treatment of you. She’s hanging up and ignoring you, because she knows her behaviour is wrong and doesn’t want to change it or admit it. 

If someone makes you feel bad on a regular basis and refuses to listen when you bring it up, then they are not the right person for you. Find someone who makes you happy and treats you with respect."
"Your situation sounds incredibly challenging.  The oldest comment had a nice script to say.  Connect with those you want a healthy relationship with sometime in the future.  As you know from your own experience, severing )or limiting as much as possible) relationships with abusive and hurtful people is healthy.  Do what is right and good.  Take a long view perspective, e. g., Who would I want my friends or children to know in 20 years? You can and will weather this drama storm.  Good luck.  "
"I'm confused as to why he is willing to commit to spending his life with you but does not feel it's necessary to contribute to household bills.  If he's expecting to be a kept man, maybe he's not yet mature enough for a live-in relationship."

People know because she did things like come to my birthday and make out with me in front of everyone.  Or invite me out when her Co workers were around etc.  I am worried of her freaking out and causing a scene at work or even worse falsely accusing me etc
You’ve hit the nail on the head.  OP needs to create major distance before she ends up in a bad situation that’s out of control. 
"I know this isn't the focus of your post, but was your GF able to voice her perspective and feelings regarding your 6 month lull too? I imagine she had been feeling a bit disrespected, alone, and hurt during this period too and the only way you two are going to \*actually\* move on and heal is if both of you are on the same footing. When I went through a rough patch with my BF, I was very concerned with him hearing me out as to why we were in this patch and what I had been feeling. I felt he had done me worse than I had done him, and I wanted to make sure he apologized. As it turns out, that's a horrible perspective to have and solved absolutely nothing!!! We had to both come together, discuss the hurt we had caused each other, and both prove ourselves worthy and willing to grow and change. If I alone had apologized, it would not have worked. If he alone had apologized, it would not have worked. Make sure you two have the same footing!!

&amp;#x200B;

As for Erica, the only way around it is by letting it go. Keep your relationship strictly professional, interact with her as little as possible, and focus on remembering how great it feels to be loved by your GF. This likely won't be the only time ""the grass is greener"" hits you, so in these moments it's important to take stock of what's actually filling your cup. Schedule a date night with the GF and focus on your intimacy (not just physical!). Invest your time in your relationship and you'll find you have little time or desire to invest in distractions. If you try to keep one foot in your GF and one foot in Erica, you'll never be happy."
"This was emotional to read because this reminds me of how I grew up. My family was cold and distant. Nobody said I love you, no hugs, no showing they cared about me. No spending time together having fun. I felt invisible and alone. I'm almost 30 and I turned out to be just like them. I have trouble developing deep relationships with people and ex boyfriends have described me as cold. At her age, this is still fixable. 

Little actions to show you care is a good start. Something as simple as picking up her favorite treat on your way home from work would be nice. You could leave it in her room for her to come home to with a note. One of my friends would have Starbucks dates with her dad once a week, that's a good option too."
"I know you’re right. It’s just hard to accept that the last 8 years have meant nothing. 
Thank you"
"Just wanted to reiterate that your therapist is full of shit!

Is this the same therapist who told you that every relationship you have will have problems, essentially indicating that you should suck it up and deal with his childish behavior?  

Because if they're different therapists, they're both full of shit!

Both of those indicate that the therapist has their own agenda they're trying to push."
"It means she’s trying to manipulate you. Only abusive people break up with someone when they don’t really want to be broken up. She’s trying to gain power over you. Sorry this happened, block her imo. "
thank you for taking the time to unpack this. it’s really confusing because none of us are real adults and we just go along with shit. i’m not excusing my behavior at all and i know i’ve done shitty stuff down the line too. i really don’t know if he’s using everyday though. i call him all the time to check up on him and i always know when he’s on xanax because he’s really monotone and sounds uninterested. as far as crack and heroin go i don’t think he does it regularly but you’re right. also im dumb and i’ve left out some important details like the fact that i did cut her off after this past weekend. also my mom (who i no longer see anymore) was an alcoholic since i was little and was very violent. but alcoholics are somewhat different than heroin and crack addicts (i don’t know if this is true but in my experience i think it is ) also my boyfriend was heavily addicted to xanax when we first started dating early in highschool. i’d say he was more addicted to it than B ever was. but i think you’re right. the hard part is cutting off B because i care about him and i don’t wanna leave him alone. i worry about him so much and i know he has no one else looking out for him the way i do. 
He said that she makes him want to kill himself. It's in the headline.
"So what happens if you get cancer? Will you have to drive yourself to chemo? Or if you are pregnant, will you be going to the ultrasounds for yourself? How about if you wind up with some type of major injury? Who will take care of you then? Not your BF.

Your boyfriend has shown his true colours. He shows you that not only is his love limited, but that he doesn't want to help you out.

You are not valued in his eyes. At all. A partner is supposed to help out when one member of the team is down.

But nothing I saw will make you understand how badly he's treating you. Even if you bring it up to him, he'll make promises, maybe even get better.

But then next time something bad happens, he will let you down again. Because he doesn't value you enough and never will.

You deserve better. You deserve a partner that will be there for you. Always. Not just in the good times."
"I’m not sure if their concerns are valid. I do suffer from depression as a result of everything but it’s not evident enough to warrant concerns and I have not felt the need to end my life since I’ve been independent from my mom. The last place my family members would ever look is inward. I assume when they assume it’s just them thinking how could I not speak to them there must be a valid reason like me being in a hospital bed

If their concern is valid though I’m not sure what they hoped to achieve by harassing me (and sometimes my friends). They weren’t really there for me when I attempted at 13. They guilted me pretty bad that a mother should never have to bury their own child and beyond that no further support. 

Thank you for putting it that way - I’m not a victim...I’m a survivor!"
"There is so much pressure to feel certain ways or not feel certain ways, especially around death. It is presented as normal to grieve this way, but not that. And it can be false because it is what is generally felt. It represents the center group, not everyone. 

Your feelings are totally valid and normal. As this poster showed others have felt the same way. 

As for those who want to lie about the past and want you to deny the truth, let them go. There is nothing to gain from trying to change their minds. They have too much invested in her being not what she was because if they admit how she treated you, they have to admit their guilt in it all. They don't want to face the truth. Let them go. Give them no more power over you. "
In 20 years both your parents will be dead and you won't even care 👍
"So, I'm a serious relationship sort of person too, but you shouldn't just give that ""you're the one for me"" mantle to anybody or just give up everything to them because you have some feelings and assume that it will be fine in the end. Relationships need more than love and ""giving up everything"". Yeah, a lot of that other stuff isn't so romantic, but it's essential.

One recurring theme throughout your post is that your ex doesn't now and never really did ever respect you. That's why everything felt off, that's why this relationship didn't work out, because respect is a huge component of love. He simply didn't love you the way you deserve to be loved."
"Your mom sounds like a bitch. If my mom ever said that to me I would have left too. I'm sorry this happened. She sounds like she has her own issues and she thinks it's okay to take it out on you. It's not okay. Moms and dads are supposed to be your support system. She shouldn't be tearing you down like that. Your grandparents seem to be good people so at least you have them to lean on. 

I have a daughter and I can't imagine speaking to her that way. &lt;3 "

For a doctor OP sure is a dumb piece of shit.
yeah i agree. i was typing fast and didn’t wanna forget anything and i left that out. 
You're too old for her.
It means breaking up with her was the right decision.
"Yes, I might have been a shit dad for the past few years. We used to be much closer when she was a little girl."
Do you think that it's the distance that is causing you to doubt? Sometimes the lack of physical presence can make it difficult to understand fully your reasons for being with that person. 
Fuck that bitch! Hitting a cat. Omg don’t feel bad what she did to you is insane. I’m sorry not for her loss but as a child you had to go through that. 
"Oh holy shit your sister sounds exactly like me! 


I am naturally an anxious as fuck person and I honestly have never enjoyed children. But I love my sister and she is my best friend and I wanted to help her as much as possible when she had my nephew. I told her what I was capable of (honestly not much in the beginning) but also that I was really really good with directions. She literally just wrote out a simple schedule and options for activities (3 things to eat, and 3 places/activity suggestions) and it helped me immensely. 


I was terrified I would ""undo"" any training or routines she had with her son and as a baby I was terrified he'd choke and die or eat something and die or headbutt a wall and die or sleep and die. 



He's 6 now and I still have a lot of anxieties regarding how I need to treat him. I value control and consistency way too much but if I know what their normal routine is I'm much more comfortable just carrying that out. "
"We play D&amp;D and video games together still around caring for the baby.  It’s all done over the internet, so no meeting people in person.

My favorite hobby, Warhammer 40k, has been a point of contention in the past.  She’s complained about it taking whole afternoons in the past.  Since it’s a larger time commitment I haven’t had time to play in over a year.  And I have tried to invite her to join me but she’s not interested."
"&gt;Like what was the breakup a test or something?

Sure sounds like it. A lot of people confuse possessiveness with love and boundary violations (like trying to talk someone into taking you back) with romance. Especially when they're eighteen. You didn't do anything wrong here. She just needs to grow up."
Solid troll post my dude
"That's where I'm Leaning, she is a good person. One of the best and breaking up with me is one of the first times she's put her own happiness before the needs of others and as much as it sucks Im proud of her for that. And I dont want her to worry."
"Yikes, dude. Any sympathy I had for you has just evaporated from your continued dismissal of your daughter. You haven't seen her develop any interests other then her ""undying love for her phone (again, HUGE YIKES)"" and cheerleading because you haven't made any effort to get to know your daughter. You might as well be a stranger. No wonder she feels neglected, because that's exactly what you've been doing. Get yourself into therapy before you attempt any further to have a relationship with your daughter, because you are still in contempt of who she is as a person. "
Almost 1 week into NC and it feels pretty good
Your looking for away out so stop beating around the bush if your cheatin and i bet you are go dont do that to anyone if you care abt anything move on to me hearing you sounds like a fraud so you're ready to move on go go go just my thoughts
"OP your infatuation from Erica comes from the fact that you've been in a low place looking for validation and she liked you and gave that validation to you. Thats it. This girl wasn't even on your radar until she made you feel wanted. If you want to make your relationship work, then you need to be as professional with this woman, erica, as possible. She's your coworker. There's no reason to talk with her or spend time with her outside of anything relating to work. If you find yourself feeling guilty about not interacting with her more, consider that thats your own selfish feelings about wanting her validation popping up. The less time you spend with her, frankly, the more your feelings will fade."
"Watch out with overexercising the pup as it is. It's 5 minutes per month of age and running and jumping around really, really isn't recommended for large breeds especially german shepherds due to their high chance of getting hip dysplasia. You need to be doing mind and puzzle games with this pup at the house to help tire him out. Additionally, you should get him into puppy obedience/training classes. German shepherds are notorious for reactivity and aggression if not properly socialized and if you're just taking it out for 10 mins around the block, that's not nearly enough to be socializing this breed. I would be looking to rehome the puppy if both of you are not 100% committed to this dog. By the time it is full grown and a reactive mess neither of you will be able to walk it without assistance. You should, if you are determined to get a dog, acquire an adult one from the shelter that will not need nearly as much time put into training and socializing to make it an adjustable adult and NOT a german shepherd or any other herding or working breed. But you can thank your boyfriend for showing his true colours now and dump him while you're at it."
How do I let him know? I know nothing about him and his name and maybe his instagram account name (I'm sure I could find that out)
"Please don't go back and apologize. You did nothing wrong and that would do everything to validate her views against you. Stay strong, if it means you lose her, than so be it. She doesn't deserve to be in your life."
"My ex wanted to talk. I told my boyfriend and asked if he was uncomfortable. He wasn’t, i went, figured what he was up to, trying to reconnect, I shut him down. But if my boyfriend hinted at all that he was uncomfortable with it, i was going to flat out say no and block him. (In the end, I did end up blocking him and told him to leave me alone) If your girlfriend is not taking your feelings about this into account, she’s not the one. Leave because your feelings about this issue are completely valid and important "
"Make sure you request the new number to be unlisted.

Unless you tried that already."
So a very toxic pathern which is hard to Get out of Even if he is trying. I would be asking myself if he tries.
This needs to be on a t shirt 
"&gt; I would bet most of the people judging you were also enablers for your mom's crappy behavior. 

Yes, 100x yes. 

The absolute kindest interpretation of their behaviour is that they didnt know. But they must have known"
"oof that's a hard yikes from me dawg. You've already proven to her that you are more than capable of completely dismissing her at her most tender moment, the moment where she trusted to confide in you her most delicate feelings, hoping that you as a parent, and as a father, would understand that you've hurt her.

&amp;#x200B;

You will need to upend everything you know about your daughter and relearn who she is as a person if you want to build a real relationship with her. There's no easy way to do this, you'll need to recondition who YOU are as person, you will need to become a better man. Apologies are words. Action is change. Gifts are nothing but an exchange of money. Quality time is vital. Genuine care is all that matters.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck."
Enjoy your trip without him and while your away find a new bf.
"How fucking ridiculous. I own a home and my boyfriend was renting, so he moved into my house. He immediately offered to pay half the mortgage/bills, no issues. Because that is what makes sense. Hell he actually offered to pay more than half since he makes almost 3x more money than I do, but I declined. Instead he just pays more for food than I do. 

You should seriously reconsider this relationship, or at the very least the cohabitation part. He wants to take advantage of you. You are being more than reasonable and he is the one who is in the wrong here. "
"Open a new account just in your name, and choose what to deposit in the joint account."
"Bad therapist. 

While I agree that everyone has flaws, you can find someone whose flaws don't go so far against your needs. Your life right now is wearing you down. No partner should have a role in leaving you weary."
Thank you
"How have you challenged these racist comments when they’re brought up? My dad does the same thing, somewhat similar to you in that he’s an Asian dad who sacrifices a lot for his family. I am also dating someone of a different race.

I think it’s important to be firm and let him know that you cannot accept those types of comments anymore, and be honest about your relationship - have you told your family about your girlfriend yet? If not, tell them, and make sure to follow up on shutting down any possible racist reactions that may come from that announcement. Don’t be so quick to cut off contact and see how and if you can make a significant change."
"My relationship with my twin sister is perfectly normal. The reason why we are still close is because we've been best friends since we were little. Since my parents are no more, she's the only family I have. We do rely on each other for emotional support (I am unsure if that can be seen as boundary issues).
"
"be an adult and learn how to say shit with your chest. “i blocked you because you’ve made me feel uncomfortable in the past” or “i blocked you because you pushed my boundaries”. you’re an adult, you can do whatever you want to preserve your peace of mind. "
Social media should not play such a large role in people’s lives. You are entitled to make whatever decisions you want regarding your privacy AND it is not your responsibility to justify those decisions to anyone else. You did the right thing.
"Check out r/raisedbynarcissists 

You are not in the wrong for taking yourself away from that toxicity. "
Family therapy might be recommended if it’s an option. She may feel more willing to open up with a non related adult there. Just the two of you. And it shows her that you are willing to put in her effort to take your relationship seriously. 
Why the hell are you dating a high school kid.    Break up now.  Good grief man.

"You were totally in the right to not go. I haven't spoken to my father in 18 years, and probably wont attend his funeral. If I can, may I ask why your mom was good to your sister and not you? Did your sister witness this abuse? "
"Ian going to give you one word of advice.   If you value your sister explain to her why you didn’t go.   Funerals are for the living.   Not the dead.   She may have wanted you to be with her or not.  I don’t know.   

But that’s a cal you need to make if you value her as a person.  If not cut ties and enjoy your life.  "
Block him as soon as you break up - then he can't badger you into staying and you won't give in. 
"Yup, that conversation ended exactly where he wanted to. He was waiting for an opportunity to call Julie a ten. Seems like he couldn't wait to say it again."

You've lost 50 lbs? He thought he was better than you. He has been living under the impression that you owe him big time for condescending to date you.

"you shuold have wrote in the post "" This was our third date ( and our last ) "" Move on, this one is toxic and a loser, find someone who would have texted you without your reasonable request, even on a perfectly clear warm summer night."
Obviously bad Time management and money management. Bail
"Ugh.  I’m sorry you even tried to explain yourself to him.  

That was a totally normal and polite thing.  

And while the mom’s in our lives tend to be the polite ones willing to make the request, I actually have several guy friends (including 2 of my friends husbands) who will make this request of me, even without bad weather. 

This summer I road tripped from Nebraska to New England and it was a gf hubby texting every evening to be sure I was safely in a hotel. Heh.  (He’d gotten over his concern by my return trip, I just realized. So maybe he just wanted me gone? 🤣).  And admittedly I DID call him mom, but I still appreciated the concern. 

Even if this guy is too young / false macho to appreciate the request, most people wouldn’t have reacted this rudely.    You’re definitely better off knowing now.

"I'm a little confused, so how exactly is she paying for her trips/living (groceries, car, gas,ect.)? All on credit cards? I'd be worried about her earning 60k when she's blown $14,000 she doesn't have 😕"
"You shouldn't be.  Marriage is supposed to be a place where you can say anything and trust your partner's judgment to place protect your feelings first.  People here always talk about trusting their partner in terms of infidelity.  Sharing intimate details of your relationship with others is actually a much more common betrayal that frequently undermines a marriage over time.  If your wife is dismissing/ignoring your expressed feelings about this, it's something you really need to take up in couples counseling. "
You both sound too immature to get married. One year of dating isn't enough.
I have zero insurance. 
"Ugh, I hate to think that might be true. But yes, I could be being very naive right now. I feel like my sanity and mental health has taken a hit from spending the past year in this situation. "
THAT is a hindrance. And if he isn't negotiating with you on transportation (even getting her to childcare) then you know what? the person calling it financial manipulation isn't wrong.
"That is odd, my husband and I have always hung out with friends but we are THAT couple.

I fear that if i put myself first he will see it as me not supporting him. Any advice on how to mitigate that?"
"Cut her off. Unfortunately, that’s the best way to get over someone. Maybe try a friendship when you’re both in better places."
"Unfortunately that is normal in cultures that invest upwards to ancestors. You aren't supposed to keep anything for yourself, it's your child's job to do that for you. For people who then move to a culture that invest downwards to descendants, they get stuck straddling the two worlds and try to invest both ways, and are left with nothing and no one investing in them. It's a hidden cost of emigrating. It's very sad but there isn't really a solution. Your dad sounds like a conscientious man who is unlikely to abandon what he considers his responsibility. He is probably going to work until he dies. :("
I don’t think you’re overreacting at all. You were showing concern for his wellbeing and he was rude and took it as an insult.

"You can, but I suspect you do so with the intention of freeing her up so you can pursue her. Careful, she will resent you when she inevitably finds out and part of her will always long for her ex because she didn't get the closure she needed.

Ultimately unless she chooses to leave him then there will always be that shadow over you. A year of relative bliss with you wasn't enough to shake her to the right decision, you think sabotaging them will help? "

i’m concerned that he told you he “started dating a blonde and it was too much change.” like.... he only sees you as your external looks?! does he know that people change with time? what if you get married and grow old together.... you body will change with time and pregnancy/birth if you choose to have kids.... you might go grey/white when you’re old and he’ll be like “i started dating a young blonde”? he needs a swift kick in the senses.

"It's not the picky eating that's the problem, it's the complete lack of care for OP and how problematic this is for her. Anyone can be a decent picky eater if they sort out their own meals and don't complain when they don't get their way, but this is the food version of 'she divorced me because I left dishes by the sink'. It's about caring about your partner, and he clearly doesn't care about you. "
Classic Mr Struggles.
"Like a normal rational logical human being? Nah they hated you, they pretty much just told you to go commit toaster bath if you think about it. /s"
Nope... Not unless you know him. That's her problem. 
"Unless you have something to say, like to invite her on a date or something, say nothing.

When in doubt, always say nothing. "
"As someone who has not only been on the receiving end of that line, but has also told others to drive safe, I can tell you with certainty that you're not overreacting. It's just goes to show that you care about that person and want to be reassured of their well-being. To be told that it isn't your place is incredibly condescending. Not to mention its pathetic that he took your concern as a blow to his fragile masculinity.

Be done with this guy already.

&amp;#x200B;"
"Except you would have said gladly or the like.

Get out now before it's too late. This guy has issues
"He doesn’t actually feel bad, and he says exactly what he means to say. "
If your not cool with this it's not okay. Better to find someone who won't pull this kind of crap. There's plenty of people who won't. 
"My fiance was like this for a very long time (for reference I was (19F) and he was (24M) when we first met). Wouldn't eat veggies or fish, or drink water, and couldn't cook anything more complicated than macaroni and cheese. Every meal was a plain meat and cheese taco, a bowl of plain mac and cheese, or pizza. The only reason he didn't get scurvy was because there's vitamin C in mountain dew. And God forbid something he didn't like managed to sneak it's way into his food. I remember watching him dry heave in the Taco Bell parking lot because he bit into a tiny little square of chopped onion. It was embarrassing, I felt like I couldn't go places with my friends because he'd whine and complain and go hungry, and my family straight up made fun of him about it.

Turned out there's a strong possibility that he's on the autism spectrum. He avoids certain foods because he has sensory issues, and a lot of different textures bother him to the point of strong negative physical reactions. He's working on it, though. After years of refusing to even try different things, and after a LOT of nagging and begging, I finally got him to eat a vegetable. He's still kinda whiney, but it's better. In fact last week he ate salmon and asparagus! 

I'm not saying that your partner will change, because everyone is different. If he does change, it may take a lot of work. It may be worth it to you, or it may not. But definitely consider that it might be more than just ""pickiness"" and that he may want to consider seeing a psychiatrist."
"Lmao, what the hell did I just read?"
Many people know of her infidelity. Somebody I know from the gym who knows her bf asked me if I want the bf to find out. So technically it wouldn't be coming from me.  If they break up do I have a chance? 
"Yeah, this guy has serious issues with women. Dodge this bullet OP."
"There's no easy way to do it, you just have to tell her. The best way to look at it is that she's going to be more crushed the longer you wait, which is worse for both of you.


I was in nearly the same scenario as you several years ago. I realized the day we got back together that it was a mistake, but I couldn't bring myself to do anything about it. For 6 months. It was the most miserable time in my life (probably hers as well) and I was pretty constantly depressed and anxious. Things got better after I ended things again, but it would've been best for both of us to just cut it off early."
Finding a sober cheater that never strays again is about as likely as winning the lottery. 
"You’re right, sexual assault is a more broad term, but it’s different than rape and can be much worse than slapping your coworker’s ass."
Wow you dodged a bullet. It is incredibly kind &amp; thoughtful to ask someone to text you. He’s just a jerk. 👋🏻 
"Holy hell. Please don't go on another date with him O.p. Good god, man already sounds like he's got some serious anger issues hidden, not that far deep down."
"Girl, you wrote ALL THAT and hes still your boyfriend? Come on, now. "
That is a very astute observation. I've never thought of it that way before. I hope he can enjoy himself instead of working to death
BTW he's making her sound out of her mind so that it doesn't seem real. She is a real person with depression - not a grandma with dementia where he has to create a pretend world for her where you don't exist. How odd. 
"Surprised I had to come this far for someone to mention sensory issues. I’ll eat whatever is served to me but often I have to gag it down with water, fighting retching all the way. Communal meals are a huge source of anxiety and my pickiness is a constant source of shame.  
  
I’ve tried therapy and will continue to work at improving but it’s not as easy as it may seem, even for those of us who want to change."
"Actually, what you describe is a common problem in troubled marriages.  Immature women may think it's okay to share intimate aspects of their marriage with others, that doesn't mean violating the implicit exclusivity of marriage is a good thing to do.   "
"I haven't ever moved (but I am planning on moving a year from now!), however, I did live in a cheap apartment in my city with a bunch of backpackers and expats from all over the world. They made friends by going to bars and pubs and just chatting with strangers- might sounds weird, but people are usually very willing to chat on a night out. More specifically, if there are any backpacker bars hit those up as a lot of people would be in the same position that you're in. 

Otherwise, hobbies are always good. Into hiking? There's a meet-up group for that. Into playing Super Smash Melee? There's a community for that, lol. 

And, is your GF working with people who are younger?"
Right. It’s not like the OP was letting herself in and redesigning his living room. She asked him to text her because of the shitty driving conditions. The nerve.
I keep telling him. I see he can barely open his eyes while driving sometimes but he won't let me take over. It scares the shit out of me.
"This sounds like it will boil down to what can be compromised. I think she should be able to understand that this is something that bothers you and hopefully it matters to her enough that she's willing to compromise with some nights out with you on occasion. It would make you happy and that's something she should want to do. With that being said, I can also see why she would like to go out with just her friends to have a girls night out and such. Nothing wrong with that. The main idea here would is understanding the two different points of view on the situation and be willing to compromise. It also sounds like she's going through the classic college stage where you have almost no responsibility and have tons of opportunities to meet new people and hang with friends, so take that with a grain of salt."
"He sounds immature, if he’s not going to see you guys as equals, then you need to put yourself first. Focus on you, quit babying him, and do what you need to do "
I literally say this to every person I've ever gone on a  date with if we're out somewhere and they have to drive home.  It's never meant with I'll will or intent. Seems like he has some kind of ego problem. 
Ask your mom to help you get rid of him and sue for the cost of your car. 
"If he responded that way to a text, imagine how he’d respond in person "
It's not weird.  It's a good way to make some new friends too.
"I agree. How does one do that? I feel like it's a balance. I want my BF to know I love and support him but I also love my career. 

Should I have stayed at work?

Should I make a big fuss about him missing my race?

"I think that you value a single person too highly - higher than you value yourself. I have the same issue with an ex who dumped me and tried to come back, but that's another story. 

&amp;#x200B;

The advice I take is to keep working on myself until I am content being alone. In your case, once you are content without the need for this love, test the waters. Reach out to your old friend and try to arrange coffee or lunch as friends. Feel out the situation and see if they are flirty or at least friendly. Try to organically get her on a date if the coffee/lunch goes well. When you ask her out you will know if she is interested."
"It's not that he doesn't know, it's that he doesn't think it's worth the effort.  If he wanted to make a change you would have noticed a difference.

This guy isn't ""judgmental,"" he's an ass."
"Maybe don't try to figure him out like he's a puzzle. Just enjoy his ""show.""  But probably watch from afar. He's either a junkie or a liar, both of which make unreliable or even dangerous friends who leave damage in their wake."
My head agrees with you 100%.  My heart hurts for him but I know it’s not right to reach out.  Ugh. 
"Yeah that’s not how you go about thinking about your future. You don’t spend thousands on trips when you have no income and have over 300K in student loans  based on your future career.

"""Its not your place to tell me to text you."" WTF is that?! He sounds like a misogynist asshole to me."
"I'm a man, and it's not your place? Fuck that. Cut him loose now. "
Good point.   I’ll edit my answer.

"I turned into a ""super picky"" person who didn't have much of a variety of eating tastes, into someone that only has a list of things they don't like to eat, aside from weird animal parts (pigs feet, cows tongues, etc).  This is how it happened.

* I started to learn how to cook for myself after I move out of my family's house.
* I started to learn how to cook, living on my own.  At the time I was a student and had quite the budget
* I live somewhere very multicultural, I don't even know I've ordered some of the time.  I've also visited a lot of areas that don't speak English and have tons of surprises as well.
* I've visited cooking demonstrations that show you the art behind cooking.
* When cooking veggie dishes among others, I've learned how to cook to correctly use spices and carbs to enhance the dish to make veggies taste amazing.

I'm now someone that tends to generally eat a fair amount of veggies and generally a fairly health meal.  I'm able to cook meals from many cultures and I'll eat almost anywhere.  I can easily make entirely vegan meals, or a meatlovers dream.

Try to learn how to cook some delicious veggie based dishes for your husband.  Eventually you should be able to convert him.  Otherwise you're right, he's going to die early and teach your children bad eating habits."

"My first thought was maybe he's joking, but it seems like it went beyond what I'd consider light hearted. Saying he knows how to drive is weird if it's a joke, and telling her it's not her place...
Unless he made it obvious with emojis or something then I'm pretty sure he was serious. "
"thats the problem, i dont feel like i can personally come back from this, there's been breaches of trust before but this one hurts the most, i dont feel enough confidence in myself to expose myself and be intimate anymore"
It may have been a joke except he kept doubling down.
I don’t know really. Honestly I don’t even know how to act. Never thought I’d see this from her 
I'm genuinely curious why you hate people caring about you and showing concern?
Don’t ever see him again. 
"You seem to be overthinking, your ex no longer should concern you and you acknowledge how you are better off without him. Keep in mind that Mike also lost contact with his friend through this period, so he is most likely just expressing gratitude for having someone to talk to."

We never go out to non-fast food/pizza places and I’ve gotten increasingly angry/resentful when trying to plan meals. That’s a good point about not wanting to leave his comfort zone at all and being extremely stubborn. I need to end it, it’s just hard when you’ve been together for so long.."
"As a male, that would have been a cute gesture for me. "
He has mummy issues and you don't need to deal with that crap. end it because that sort of gave you a sneak peak into his character as a person and what you have to deal with if you continue seeing him.
Please listen to this person.

"No. Seriously? No. Especially after explaining why you asked he was a dick. Be done.

My friend asked me that the first time we hung out, and continues to every time. He does it to all his friends, guys and girls. It seems sweet and caring.

Just say you thought he might want to be the last thing in your mind as you fall asleep but... guess not. 
"Its that your girlfriend is intentionally leaving the door open.

She probably has a few guys waiting around for when you guys break up.

So confront, maybe. If it's all too stressful you can just ghost him. He'll get the hint.

Ignore, definitely not."
You're thoughtful. Now run.

"Veganism if managed *extremely* carefully, is healthful. You can get all of your essential nutrition within its confines. 

Carnivorism *can* also supply all of the nutrients you need, but in order for that to happen you have to be willing to eat ""gross"" meat products like intestines/stomach/brains. If you don't, your diet is severely lacking many nutrients. You're literally malnourishing yourself. 

Not wanting a carnivore partner is completely reasonable. I honestly wouldn't want a vegan partner either, but that's more for the superiority complex that's invaded every vegan I have ever met."

"&gt;He said, “I’m a man. I can handle myself. It’s not your place to tell me to text you.”

Insecure and sexist. How gross."
"You can't really have her 'back', that is the whole problem. She was using you as escapism, to avoid dealing with her actual relationship. As a result you got a distorted and idealised version of a relationship with her: all that pent up frustration expressed emotionally and sexually, I am sure it was very raw. But it wasn't 'real' because at the end of the day it was never actually a relationship. 

You longed for a true relationship and held on a long time for it, built it up in your mind, that is part of why you can't let go. But it is pretty clear she was never really wanting that with you, sidestepping entirely what an awful partner she seems to be. 

\&gt;It's shaken my faith in relationships as a whole. 

I mean, you were in a cheating dynamic with a girl. You clearly didn't have much respect for boundaries or relationships to begin with. It has shaken your confidence in yourself but even that is only because you have never really been honest about this to yourself.

You spent a year being a bad person with someone who is clearly a mess. The fantasy had to end eventually.

He’s not worth you, lol. "
I understand this. I guess I bring in some of my issues in it too....

Your boyfriend is so covered with red flags that astronauts should be able to see him from space.

I understand that this is not something that you want to hear, but he's not a good person. You deserve someone who is kind to you, who loves you unconditionally, who doesn't call you names and who does prioritize you more than a dog. (There are a lot more and much higher standards that you deserve in a dude, but I'm trying to keep this short.) Yes, caring for your dog is important but what idiot brings a dog that hates hiking to the mountains?

He was devastated when we broke up. Said he never saw it coming... even though I’d told him over and over again what he did that bothered me and things just never changed.

"I don't speak to either of my parents, not for a few years now. Yes there was cruelty and abuse, but the main reason I had to cut them out was because of the lies and gaslighting and their constant rewriting of reality to serve themselves.

"You’re a pos. The only reason you’re trying to go about this so it doesn’t effect your work life, is because you know that as a doctor you will get in trouble for fucking a nurse.

"I moved in with my husband into his house before we were married. I paid a 50% split of all bills ( for the house, so gas electric, insurance, TV, internet and water) plus £150 towards whatever he wanted to use it for. It was only fair. We both saved money this way ( me not paying for a place) and him getting cheaper bills etc. 

We also split all food and we shared the cost of any house related costs that benefited us both and we both agreed to. So the new TV we shared the cost on. A games console he wanted, he paid for. I didn't contribute towards household upgrades ( new bathroom, boarding out the attic as that was stuff that if we split I couldn't potentially take half of. Stuff like TVs that could be removed from the house we agreed to split fairly if we had joint purchased. 

Obviously in the long run we worked out and now live in a house together that we both have money invested in although I'm currently a sahm so don't contribute much at all. 

Our system was fair. Yeah he can go out and rent a shitty room in a shared house for less, but he has to deal with not having much personal space and potentially the other Tennant's. I would suggest you're being more than reasonable and if he has an issue with that I'd either rethink the relationship ( because you've been together long enough to share costs)  or let him find a place to live alone and experience it properly and then revisit the conversation.

In our case middle school was a real low.  Things are a bit better now (I have a 17 yo).   But as you know it’s not a case where there is any fairness or equity.  When she says she has needs, you have to jump in even if you’ve spent a year being ignored or called names ...

I'm more worried about her and my job. I want to do it in a way where she doesn't think it came from me.  FYI her cheating was VERY public.

When I made the comment, the majority of the posters said “she needs to stop doing that shit” ... that’s not how it works. If it was, there’d be no mental illness or mental health professionals. If OP listens to that and says to his GF “your OCD is causing me problems, Reddit says you need to stop doing your compulsions” then he’s only doing them both damage. "

Yeah and I pointed this out to you right here. You can feel bad all you want, but you're just as guilty. If you have any decency, you will tell the guy because he deserves to know. There's probably no way for you to tell him and not have some kind of backlash. You slept with a coworker. She'll probably know it's you. But this guy needs to know she's cheated on him again."

"You can be a much better parent than the ones you had, but you need mentors and models.  Do any of your friends have good relationships with their parents?  Can you make friends with some of those “creepily happy families”?  

Also, don’t underestimate the power of knowing what not to do.  What needs did you have that your parents weren’t meeting?  You know now that if your child has a similar need, you will meet it.  

And just the fact that you’re concerned about it means that you’ll do better than your parents."
Thank you. All these comments made me feel better. Its largely the whole extreme anxiety surrounding buying this house and spending all my life savings thats making me so nervous and paranoid. I nearly threw up and felt like fainting at the closing.
"Hey! I just wanted to say I hear you about the concern for hurting his feelings. I can not bear to be rude or hurt anyones feelings even if they have been completely awful to me. Like seriously it makes me feel sick to think of it. BUT he isn't concerned about hurting your feelings at all. 

I am a great believer in actions speaking louder than words with parenting. Why put up with something that you wouldn't want your kids to put up with from a partner? If you have sons would you want them to treat their partners like he is treating you?

I have three kids and a partner who is not their dad. What they used to see from us is everyone pitching in and doing what they can. For instance I love cooking, so I would cook and my partner would be my sous chef and do dishes and the kids would be my commis chef and put away the dry dishes. On Saturday morning clean up we all had our chores to do and because everyone pitched in it got done, and then we all got to enjoy our weekend. 

My kids were just a bit older than yours when my partner moved in, and I worked full time in a professional role at that time so my kids were used to helping out anyway but not once did they question anything because my partner always did his fair share after he moved in. Two of the kids came to visit us in Malaysia for a few weeks and we all fell into old habits, kitchen work plus Saturday morning clean up taking turns to clean the toilets (because no one likes that job). 

My greatest take from this is that I have shown my kids how they should be treated and how they should contribute to the household. What do you want to show your children? Also as much as it's important  to not involve kids in your relationship issues I think it is important to not make excuses for him, you'll just teach your children to make excuses for their partners bad behaviour and make them think he is more important than them. "
"It seems to me that the dog was an excuse to end things. It doesn't really seem like you were given thorough explanation for why he decided to end things - either that, or he's insecure that you can't give him all of your attention and now have to care for a dog. Either way, unless he has expressed that pet ownership is a dealbreaker, it doesn't seem like a legitimate excuse to break up.

Also, he called you a ""bitch"" with no remorse. He seems pretty immature and can't communicate his feelings. I would not try to initiate contact with him - focus on enjoying your new dog! :-)"
"Your daughter is a bad-ass for confronting you on your bullshit. She is kind of my hero right now.

You should write her a heart-felt letter and schedule more one-on-one time with her.

As far as ""you shouldn't compare yourself to other people"" remark, that really isn't true for everything. Lots of people don't realize how badly they are being treated in their relationships until they see how other people are treated. I would like to think that as this girl's father, you wouldn't want her to put up with an abusive spouse or boss on the basis of whatever reasoning you were trying to sell her on. It would be silly if she wanted you to buy her a pony like all her friends have. It is not silly to want the same kind of warm, loving relationship everyone else around her seems to enjoy."
"I'm so happy that you found your voice. You stuck up for yourself, and that is a big deal. I recommend getting a solid understanding on nutrition and focus on fueling your body and making it strong.  Keep your head up, you got this."
"Yes but I’m more worried about you than her. You cannot just sit and wait for her to put the phone down. It isn’t fair. You don’t have to go no contact. But you can gently put the ball in her court by saying “I need to talk to you. I feel like you are putting me aside in favor of social media. When you are ready to be present in this relationship, I will be here. Until then, I’m giving you some space to figure it all out and giving me some freedom from worrying about something I cannot change.” 
I’m a huge fan of boundaries in relationships. They work. They force the other person to respect you because you are not a doormat. "
"Look, I cannot guarantee this will not affect your work life. You should have thought about that before you slept with someone from the same work place as you. That's what happens when you s\*\*\* where you eat. The boyfriend deserves to know. If you want to make it vague, make it vague, but he deserves to know. I hope you learn from this and never sleep with anyone from your work place again. "
"No worries! It's pretty new tech so not everyone is aware. Before it was available the only way WAS amnio which, as you correctly point out, does carry a slight risk of miscarriage. "
If you are already going to couples counselling before marriage then I think your question has already been answered...
"This is just a huge red flag. Your partner needs to be available to pick up the slack during times of hardship and this isn't even that much more slack. Like what? He'd have to walk the puppy in the morning for a week or two? The outrage. To be perfectly clear there wouldn't of been a conversation between my wife and I if this happened. Either person would be like oh your knee hurts? No worries, get better and then when you're ready you can take over again.   


Anyway, whats going to happen later in life if you two get married and have kids? Lets say you are supposed to be watching the kids and get sick. Does he expect you to power through it? And what if the alternative happens and he gets sick? Is your response to him supposed to be ""deal with it"" it's your responsibility we agreed to before this and your obligated. Or would he be selfish and demand special treatment, but only when it favors him?  


Anyway this is just stupid on multiple levels. Like at best he just has a very rigid personality and can't think outside the box or at worst he is selfish person who doesn't care about anyone else's needs. And if he doesn't care about his SO's problems then he probably doesn't about anyone else's as well.  


If I was you i'd be surprised and confused about his response because it's so out of the realm of normal human behavior that something is up. Anyway, this is one of those things you need to look into because it's potentially a giant red flag. "
"If he ""loves you too much"" then why isn't he doing his part to SHOW you that? He isn't even making you feel worthy of his time let alone loved. Either have a come to jesus talk or leave him for the last time.

And since you say he wanted you to make this thread, this one's just for him: Get a fucking dogsitter and pay attention to your partner, asshole. A break up doesn't require consent."
"OP, I agree with the other commenter that says to rehome the puppy.  This is the best time to do it.  You are certainly doing your best, but with your boyfriend acting the way he is, puppy isn't getting the care she needs.  

&amp;#x200B;

Then I'd consider re-homing your boyfriend.  He doesn't act like a partner."
"Yo, OP's soon to be ex, you're a shitty boyfriend and need to do some drastic reflection if you ever want to be in a real relationship again. "

nope... she has toxic behavior. this series of text is just a small glimpse into abusive behavior. She proposed breaking up over you not paying for everything... If you decide to stay with her she definitely needs to explain why she texted you these things instead of talking to you in person and ask her why she sees gender roles that way? Ask her if she would be okay with her  being discriminated against for being a woman and if she believes in gender equality?
Live your life for you 
"""If she wanted cuddles maybe she should go to her mom"" 

This is exactly like something my abusive dad would say and I cried reading it."
"Everyones weight loss struggle is different. Some people reach success cutting deeper than others. Don't say impossible when that's just what happened to you. You are not everyone. Don't spread assumptions. 

I personally ran a 2lb a week (1000cal/w) deficit for months on end and was hungry often. I was able to resist just fine. Certainly not impossible. Speak for yourself please. "
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean anything by it really. You’re probably a great woman and I don’t think that being married has any indication of your worth. 
I dont have any history of shady behavior. She probably in the same way I went through hers to reassure herself. Maybe her history of being cheated on. Maybe since we dont communicate as much during the day which I'm at work. Everyone that knows me would call me loyal. It doesnt bother me that she does though if it makes her reassured.
"Please stay with your grandparents forever. Your mother and father are abusive. I'm so, so sorry this is happening to you."
"&gt;And today, she says Jim's messaged her asking if she's ok. She asked me if she was allowed to reply without getting in trouble.

This is a shitty, manipulative move on your girlfriend's part and yeah, there is spite in her words. She's shifting the guilt of her emotional affair with Jim onto you by ~~implying~~ outright telling you that you'd upset her by not allowing her to reply to Jim's seemingly innocent message. She knows you don't want to come across unreasonable and controlling, so here you are asking Internet strangers if you're justified in feeling uncomfortable with how she keeps breaking her promises not to contact a guy she most likely has feelings for and who definitely has feelings for her.

At this point, I'd just leave her to pursue whatever she wants with this guy since it's clear he's always going to be a presence in your relationship. She hasn't been trustworthy from the start and you're only a year in, so don't waste any more time on her."
I got called cold hearted from a cop cause I wouldn’t fill out a missing persons report on my dad I told the cop I wasn’t missing him just the money he owes me. 
"As a former restaurant server I can tell you 100% the people that I would have been looking badly at are your mom and the other family members who were complicit. I would have known immediately that it wasn't an isolated comment about your eating habits. And I would have wanted so bad to tell her off and find you and give you a hug. It would have taken all my self control to pretend to be nice to them so I didn't get in trouble with my job. 

Your mom is emotionally abusive. You don't deserve that. You don't need to agree with your family. She is controlling and wants to cut you off from views outside your family's because she wants you to think exactly the way she wants you to think. She's a bad mom. Most moms want their kids to eat, and would have wanted you to have a bite of something to tide you over till the food got there. 

My therapist says parents do their best, but some people's best is terrible. It's not your fault your mom is inept at treating people decently. Life will be infinitely better for you when you are on your own and refuse to let her control you (she will try). You are great just the way you are. Not perfect because no one is, but you are an individual and offer a unique perspective and outlook and that should be honored and not squashed out of you. Don't let her succeed. Dealing with her is most likely the reason you are always tired so long as your doctor has ruled out any medical reason. I don't know your weight/health but as long as your doctor feels you and your weight are healthy that is all you need to worry about. And if not they can help you with positive, healthy ways to get there. That's what helps, not abuse. Good luck to you. You deserve better and can have it before too long. "
"No, he is being a greedy bastaard by expecting to get all the benefits of living with you and with you footing all of his bills. And his framing it like he'd be doing you a favour by paying rent is fucking ridiculous. Honestly it'd do his future a favour if he had to actually live on his own for a bit."
"&gt; The relationship is 8 years old. One major disagreement with discipline for my son last year which I thought we had worked through but was slung back at me tonight. 

Never fall for the sunk cost fallacy. Instead of apologising for lying to you and being dishonest, he turned it around on you. Is that what a decent partner does?

You know better than that."
"You're over thinking it, the conversation doesn't always have to be engaging and interesting. If you talk all the time the conversation will get boring after awhile it's only natural."
"Honestly, your story only makes me think that living with the grandparents in the OP's case would be a good idea. It sounds like it took years for you and took a significant toll on you. Because of your mom, you were cutting yourself and considered suicide before your mom finally realized what she was doing. If possible, OP need not go through all the pain that you did and who knows, OP's mom may never get it. 

&amp;#x200B;

From my perspective, sure OP can tell her mom and what she is doing is hurting her and see what happens, but I doubt that the mom will get it. It likely will need to reach an extreme. An extreme that I think should be avoided.

&gt;accept that your mom is a human, too and she has her own shit she's  dealing with, and you will never understand how she feels. And that she  makes mistakes, too. All you have to do is give her a chance, be calm  and honest with her 

It's like saying, idealistically, one should be the perfect angel and accept people for all of their flaws as they abuse you. Sure you can accept that there may be things in the mom's life that is shitty, but you don't need to be a martyr for it. You can live in a non-abusive household while you let the mom reflect on all of the pain she is causing. You can try to reason with her to be better and maybe over time she will get it, but there is no need to live in the abusive household if you can avoid it. Reaching out to her and trying to get her to understand can be done while you live in a place where people don't abuse you constantly."
"And they’re asking the million dollar question. Are you contemplating telling the boyfriend out of respect for him, or as a form of revenge? If your motives are not good, don’t do it. Stay away. "
"&gt; This is how he’s going to treat you if you have kids with him.

Yes, this! If OP wants kids in the future, I sincerely hope she drops this jerk ASAP. Because he is proving himself an absolutely shit potential parent:

- Holds OP to a standard he himself doesn’t follow (insists OP take the pup out every morning during “her shift”, but thinks it’s fine for the pup to just pee in the bathroom (?!) during “his shift” at night)
- Refuses to be flexible with the responsibilities when OP is seriously injured
- Contributes the bare minimum, *way* less than OP does
- Doesn’t view then as a team tackling this responsibility together, but rather as individuals with their own “shifts”
- Demands everything works the way he wants, and won’t compromise (e.g. he wanted a German Shepard puppy, she wanted an older dog...and they ended up with a GS puppy)

I guess OP can at least be glad she found this out before having human children with him,"
But wouldn't she know it's coming from me? If for example I send him texts...I'm sure he will show her
"&gt; I don't want this drama affecting my work life

Hahaha, you lost that chance when you decided to fuck a co-worker, dumbass.  You don't get to dip your pen in the company ink and then get pissed off when it spills on your shirt.  "
"Yeah, that’s a really positive way of looking at it! Thank you!"
"Yup - that's all I can think.  How long was this going on, and how bad has it been, that she came to him - his teenage daughter - and asked to be treated better?  And he responds by mocking her and dismissing her pain?  Wow."
Why don't you get a different job?
"I get what you are saying and you are right. I haven't been particularly in touch with her lately, but I don't usually wave her off like that, no.

In the moment I guess it was a mix of being in a hurry, in a bad mood and having her suddenly bring it up."
"3 things I got from this:

1- a partner that calls you names in frustration is a partner who is not very mature. Being able to deal with conflict in a healthy manner is important for marriage and a life together.

2- He is lazy. He got the dog he wanted and the novelty has weared off. He is selfish and cares more about how tired he is than how hurt you are. Just because you technically “work-from-Home” does not mean all the responsibilities fall on you. If he is like this with a puppy and he is almost 30,  handed are that he won’t change and he’ll be the same way with kids you have.

3- he’s just an ass"
I thought I made it clear that I wasn't speaking to her anymore. Idon't want to be with her. I wouldn't be able to be with someone like her and that's why I stopped interacting with her. This is simply a question of whether the bf should know
Do a spreadsheet of the bills and show him in black and white what it will cost you. He’s not your child and you don’t have to provide for him. 
"And alternative is to split rent and utilities. Instead of splitting the payment itself, you divvy up bills like chores. I pay rent, my SO pays the credit cards, etc."
"You have text exchanges covering your ass in case of retaliation. Let the boyfriend know (he deserves to make an informed decision about the future of his relationship), apologize, and then do your own thing. In the future avoid getting involved with people already in committed relationships as it reflects poorly on you. "
Save yourself the headache. This only ever gets worse after marriage. Leave her so you don't have to deal with a divorce. 
"That's super unhealthy, and as I said, I think that's why some immature men think men and women can't be friends; because they think intimacy is only for a romantic partner, so all women become potential romantic partners if they want to be friends.

Having friends is amazing, guys. "
"I know a bunch of guys who treat their relationship partners like this. You can't be bothered to actually listen to her when all she's trying to tell you is that she wants to be close to you. But the minute! You feel like it! You expect her to drop everything and take you in with open arms.

You weren't looking to make her feel better, you wanted her to make you feel better about being a shithead dad. 

&gt;At that point I was angry and sarcastically asked if she found that cathartic or healing

It's like you don't even realize that you mocked your child for asking to be close to you. This is exactly how you're going to wind up out of her adult life, posting here asking why she doesn't want you at her wedding. 

Idk you probably need therapy in general because your overall dismissal of the emotional needs of your loved ones is likely not limited to your daughter. 

"
"You don’t need to explain anything to her.  It’s not your place.  She showers and takes care of herself.  Washing hair, especially long hair, should not be done every day.  It’s unhealthy.  

Also, she’s studying!  She’s not going out to some fancy event.  

Do you like your girlfriend for who she is?  Or are you just wanting a girlfriend that does herself up all the time?  "
Thank you for your advice. I agree I can be very judgmental.
"I'm 54. I tell all my married female friends that if their man doesnt have bro time, he just will be miserable to deal with.

I'd be gentle and inform her of your need...for her benefit. Not ask her.

Golf is excluded as that's a time sucker.

Post on r/menover30 for more responses.

What hobbies are you considering?"
"Washing long hair is really time consuming and doing it frequently isn’t healthy for the hair. She expressed it upsets her, so leave it alone. "
We are all VERY open and social about everything(mainly because we are all friends of friends or relatives in some way). I wouldn't be surprised if almost everyone was telling the truth. I have communicated with him but I don't get anywhere with it. He just stares back a bit blankly and doesn't respond much. 
"If my boyfriend was cheating on me with someone, I would want to know ASAP so I can dump the scumbag and get checked for STI's like no tomorrow. Apply that to him."

Ironically she used to slap me if I said Jesus Christ’s name in vain (i.e. Jesus Christ mom why did you do that!)
"Yes, that's an important point, thanks.

 It's a trade-off between how rich he's feeling and how long he can stand to wait"
"You're so checked out, there's not any coming back. You've already broken up with this guy, you just haven't done the paperwork or the boxing up yet. Time to stay with your mom."
It's not a big deal at all if you're secure in the fact that the person she is dating is OP or you in this case.  You sound insecure about the fact that women had lives before they fucked their current partner.
This this this. Your daughter will remember. I can list off every deep scar my father left and I bet you anything he wouldn't remember a single one. Because he didn't care.
I tried talking to her about all this and she is now angry with me and keeps saying I don’t love her and won’t speak to me. 
"It says volumes about the type of human being you are that you demonstrate this level of care for the feelings of someone who constantly shits all over yours. Break it off and find a real man, not a boy."
"We get the teenagers we deserve. OPs other daughter isn't like this because she's getting the attention and affection she needs. 

OP, if you don't fix this, be prepared for her to dive headfirst into any relationship with any dude she can find - including abusive ones - in a desperate search for that love that you never gave her.  (I speak from personal experience.)"
"The ultrasound is far more accurate than the LMP dating method (I'm a medical student). The baby is probably 16 weeks along like the ultrasound suggests, and by that count you're most likely not the father. How does the mother feel about all this, does she want a paternity test?"
Sounds like you have four children to me.
"This girl has absolutely zero respect for you, and by tolerating this kind of treatment you’re endorsing it, thus further eroding you. Cut her off entirely. You can definitely do better than a woman who gaslights and abuses you. "
"mmmm....frankly, this sounds like him saying enough to keep you around while he continues to look for other women.

&amp;#x200B;"
i think you missed the point of the post. i would read the comment OP posted to this thread and re-read what OP's concerns are
"I think you are blaming your bad mood too much for behaving in a way that is clearly normal for you. Your daughter said what her problem is and then you behaved exactly that way. You keep saying you would have behaved differently in a better mood, but if that was the case she wouldn't have had anything to complain about in the first place.

Your daughter feel like you do not love her. Stop blaming your mood during one conversation and start realizing that no matter what you would have said, you need to actively show and express love to her every single day or she will never change her mind about you."
"eh.  I mean considering your backhanded comment to OP about gaming....I don't think you are as skilled in interpersonal relationships as you might want to think.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a difference between having an open discussion with vs ""informing"" your spouse.  And yeah, when you have an 8 month old baby, you don't get to just ""inform"" your wife you are taking X hours for alone time each day without a discussion.  But again, considering your suggestion was ""golf"" (bwhahahahahah ....man you can't read a room) I'm not surprised you don't see what's wrong about that."
Thanks
"You should have walked by now but if you want it to stop with this particular guy see if you can find his Facebook by searching the number and name..... if he pops up you can probably gather his wife’s info on there. Send her a nice little message about how her husband can’t stop thinking about your gf at 3 am......

That would probably put a halt to the bullshit but I am warning you.... there will be a new guy and he might not live on the other side of the country and he might not be married. 

The problem isn’t Jim.... it’s your gf dawg."
"&gt;I know my father states I am distant with his family because I have been ""brainwashed"" &amp; there is always more to the situation than you likely see. 

In my experience, this is a really common dynamic. There are parents out there who just can't or won't admit that their own mistakes and misdeeds are what soured the parent-child relationship. So, they lean into this brainwashing theory. Of course sometimes one parent does try to alienate the child from the other parent, but I find such stories most credible when they come with specific evidence of such behavior. 

&gt;Honestly, my dad just isn't a great person 

In some cases, the children from the first family and the second family have totally different views of their shared parent. Because people are complex and can change, it is totally possible for someone to be a horrible parent to one child and a good parent to another child. Rather than admit that, however, there is strong temptation on the part of family members and others to decide that one version is the real one. "
"Okay, looking at your profile, you wrote a lot of posts about her..

What you need to do now is cut her off completely and take care of yourself. The crying and feeling down is normal to an extent but as you wrote in previous posts, your mental health seems to be at sake.

Try to talk to your parents and see if they can help you find a therapist? I found the amount of posts about her alarming and she probably damaged your self-esteem a lot and getting some help to not only get yourself out of that situation to stop hurting but also develop more self love and not fall into toxic relationships like that again..

Sending you lots of love"
"I'm glad you're listening. She's on her phone all the time, so what does she do on there? What parts of Twitter is she into? Does she play mobile games? Who are her friends and what are they like?"
"Exactly my point! I wouldn’t be worried or question anything if there was a balance. An ability to be able to do things together and others as well as her being able to out by herself with her friends. And you’re right. I just got a message saying “morning, how are you xx” which just makes me feel like shit because it’s almost like nothing happened. I told her I just want some time alone for today and she blew up at that. "
"I appreciate the feedback. I would like to point out though that all of you are being somewhat judgemental. I am not asking to be judged, I know this is bad. I am trying to find solutions. This is the .05 percent of my relationship and something like this has only happened twice in our 12 year relationship. It's easy to judge people when you don't know them. We are good people, but just have issues and we are trying to fix them...it's making me want to talk about it less with people because of all the reactions I see on this thread. You guys are not giving feedback on how to handle the situation but only calling us a piece of shit and saying to just give up "
"&gt; Even 50/50 splits are literally what friends do. 

Lol what?? That's also what people in relationships do. This is asinine. That entire text is so full of entitlement it almost seems like a joke."
Such a shit situation man. I wasn’t sure if I was just dumb for thinking and feeling the way I did. You’re definately right. Not going to be easy.
Phew
I really hope you still got that divorce.
Thanks
Address it by dumping her. That isnt attacking her.
"I think you already have the answer. It seems like you've already approached him about what you want from him, and he responded what *he* wants out of it. Some people are able to enjoy something in the moment, even if there's a looming expiration date. Some people, like you, need more security in order to feel fulfilled in the relationship. Both are fine, but there's already a mismatch of expectations in the relationship. It's fair to say that he isn't providing you with an aspect of a relationship you need, so it may be best to break up with him. "
"Amen. Am I understanding that they were having the “where is this going?” talk on the second date? Hit the brakes.  

What’s going on with your custody situation? Do you want to be tied down in a different state than where your child lives?"
"Unfortunately there probably isn't anything you can do to magically fix things.  And it might help to understand that her reasons for breaking probably go beyond what she can articulate.

Your best chance for the future may be to let her go, and to do it with kindness and grace.  Take some time for yourself before looking for someone else, and maybe check in with her in a week or two to see how she's doing.  Then wait for quite a while before contacting her again.  And go on with your life.  If you're meant to be together again, then it can happen, but it's nothing you can count on or plan for."
No that’s rubbish - sorry OP. You know whether you like someone in that way whether you’d had a relationship or not. She’s just not into you. 
"&gt; That's all I really wanted the OP to take from my post: Try and give the other person a chance.
&gt; 

I think the point I was making was that repairing the relationship can happen while you live apart. I think we more or less both agree on that part, so we agree more than we disagree I think. You can still give the person a chance. Just because you chose not to live in an abusive household doesn't mean you are giving up on the relationship. I think conflating the two things isn't correct. I find that some of my own relationships got better once we live separately. The perspective you gain by not living under the same roof and annoying each other sometimes helps. It might actually help repair the relationship faster.

&gt;Yes my mom was tough, and sometimes said things that were really hurtful, and she absolutely humiliated me a couple of times in public no less... but ultimately, I know it was coming from a loving place. Misguided, mishandled; but never sinister.

Again, I think one can both appreciate that the other person is being misguided and not sinister, but also wanting not to continue the abuse.  Both things can happen.

I think it's both commendable that you were able to have that perspective, and when that does happen for other people in such situations, I hope it doesn't veer too closely to Stockholm syndrome (but I have no authority on that subject). 

It's amazing that you were able to overcome it all such that you two have developed such a great relationship. I hope OP achieves the same thing. But I think it's also fine if OP later decides that she doesn't want that toxic relationship."
"You said ""this thing you said hurt me."" And he said ""I don't care, I meant it and I'll say it again."" Is that the kind of person you want to be with and is that the relationship that you want? 

Also, I'd like you to notice how he carefully constructed the entire initial conversation so he'd be able to call her a 10 to your face then claim moral ambiguity. "
"On its face, there will always be a perfect 10 (ugh to the rating system, by the way; it's juvenile) out there who's not you. Always. Seems as if your bigger problem is that you feel that you have more feelings, and that he is fixated on looks in a way that would elevate Julie too much in his mind. I don't have much advice, given that you are insecure about the relationship itself."
"On a certain level, you need to draw a line in the sand here. 

He doesn't get to decide if you can go or not. He can be disappointed that you're going, he can be frustrating that he can't go, he can be concerned about the risks of you going alone. 

But you can not give him the right to decide whether or not you do this. If you do, it will bite you on the ass again and again as long as you two are together. Once you give him the authority to control you like this, it's almost impossible to get back. 

If he's willing to blow up the relationship over this, that's telling you something very significant about who he is. Honestly, most women would consider him even saying that a deal-breaker, an assumption of authority that he does not have. 

But if you draw your line in the sand an he apologizes and backs off, okay. He can learn his lesson. "
"Because you’re not dating your landlord, your rent is local market rate.

Since he’s dating his landlord, he’s getting a discount.

Not really seeing the issue here. He’d have to pay rent whether he’s living alone or if they both rented an apt together. "
"Yes you are!! As a child of a severely damaged mother myself, I can tell you this. Your family members, especially your siblings, learned certain manipulative behaviors from your mom. I'm not saying you have to hate your family. You just have to love yourself enough to know where to draw the line. Because no one else has that right. Stay strong!! 💜"
"If he doesn't specify why exactly he doesn't want you to go on this trip, you are free to do whatever the fuck you want. Best case scenario is he's scared of you going by yourself for safety reasons or he wanted to share this trip with you. Worst case, he's easily jealous and/or wants to control/ dictate you life. If he doesn't start communicating properly, take the trip."
Keep being open and do better.
Don't let him move in with you. He's been mooching off you all this time and intends to continue to do so even when he's earning money. 
"&gt; We were talking about looks in general and as a game, he asked me to rate myself on a scale from 1-10 and I in turn, asked him back. 

In which OP learns that the only way to win is not to play.

And why on earth would you want to date someone you have to convince to be official?"

"Are you on r/raisedbynarcissists? The person who raised you was never a mother, just an abuser. You deserved so much better. ❤️"
"True but like, she's with you now? I mean this really gently, but what do you think is going to happen?"
"I would wait on the proposal. 

Maybe ask her to explain more of the situation and why she wants you to spend less time with her. If she makes goods points and you think you can make reasonable choices, cool. You still have a good relationship. If it turns out she is jealous or she just simply doesn't like your twin.... there might be problems. You should not have to jeprodize your relationship with your twin and your sister certainly isn't going anywhere if you get married."
Exactly how I plan on handling it when I speak with her in a couple hours. Thank you.
"&gt; I'm so sad for how vulnerable she had to be in that moment, and how she got treated

That hit me hard as well. This has been building up for *years*, and when she finally decided to make herself extremely vulnerable and try to broach this topic with OP...she got completely shot down.

“If you want hugs, go to your mother”?! Unbelievable.

OP may have just done irreparable damage to his relationship with his daughter. I hope it was worth getting in that extra hour of work."
"They've hooked up, the physical attraction is kind of implied. This is a borderline emotional affair going on. If I were the boyfriend, it would bother me to know that someone my girlfriend hooked up with is someone she spends time every day to talk with.

Look at it this way, imagine you're the boyfriend: ""My GF has a ""friend"" that she hooked up with before we were together. She spends time every single day to talk to him, and I know he's attracted/into her. She hasn't even told him we're together. Are they just friends?"" And you would have tons of people responding about how she's disrespecting the relationship, she's having a borderline emotional affair, etc. This is not a healthy friendship between a guy and a girl."
I've worked as a doctor for a decade. Some people eat shitty all their lives and feel the effects bigtime. Some people don't until they are elderly. Some people never do. Her diet isn't a given that she's going to be infirm at 35.
"He is also young and dumb enough to realize that public exposure can get himself in trouble. 

She is just trying to help him make mature choices."
This should be higher up. This is exactly how I read the situation too. 
I figured this was likely the case. He’s shown me what he’s okay with his life being and I don’t want that same life.
"He is a bit of a man-baby. He told you he was tired and went to bed which apparently translated to ""I want to have sex with you and watch tv"". It's going to be hard to sustain a meaningful relationship with a partner who talks in riddles."
"It sounds to me like he was more expressing empathy for the pain of your friends than dissing relationships entirely. Just a few weeks ago I said to a friend ""Feelings are dumb, and make us do dumb shit"" because my partner and I were breaking up. Am I now an emotionless robot? No. I was just frustrated by my own irrational feelings and frustrated by the relationship drama. "
"&gt;Also in his shared house they pay a company to arrange all the bills/utilities so they don’t have to!  I’ve not exactly helped as I just pay for most stuff currently without arguing, so I have myself to blame as well I guess that now he has that expectation.

So you have also been supporting his cost where he currently lives? Or do I understand this wrong?"
"Not at the moment, but I want to take responsibility and do the right thing just so years from now when I'm old I can look back and know I acted in such a way that could bring the best possible outcome. "
"Hey, your viewpoint is really valid. Once you get married none of this stuff is going to change and in fact it may get worse. He is just not ready for marriage because he apparently can’t even hold up his end of the relationship in terms of just live-in bf/gf. You’ve really tried. Don’t be a maid for the rest of your life. Sorry you are going through this though. "
"She is sorry she got caught, she never said how long she will stop talking for him for... you got to decide how you want to be treated in life and how you don't. Shes is blaming herself so you feel sorry for her.... let her. She made her choice. She now has to face the consequences and if it were me she would have lost me at that point. She could have handled this so differently man."
"You need to break up, and this time make it a clean and permanent cut. 

You’re worried about love? Based on your post it’s clear that you don’t even *like* this guy! It really sounds like you’re with him out of a sense of routine, pity, and obligation, not because you genuinely want to be with him. 

This sham of a relationship is bad for you and it’s bad for him too. You feel miserable and suffocated. You’re frustrated with how needy his is and how he refuses to get into needed therapy. You definitely can’t trust the guy ever again. He’s anxious and needy and upset because he can tell how you feel. 

Stop dragging this out and end it, quickly and cleanly. Let your BF *finally* suffer the proper consequences of his actions. Give yourself the chance to find someone who’s actually trustworthy. "

"I already have three children of my own from a previous relationship and he does help with them a bit as far as transportation and care. They are older 13, 11, and 10. They help around the house and have their own set of chores but they are only children and can’t help in bigger ways. They do way more than him though."
Hm.. in a way I felt that. I will try that... Thanks 😊
I have not been in contact with the ex since we stopped seeing each other. I have not gotten drugs from him except for when we were together.
"First off im sorry your in this position. Its a situation ive been in before. My boyfriend and I have a son and he is recovering heroin addict as well. While i was pregnant with our son he relapsed. Now you have to realize no matter how much you love them and think they are the love of your life, that desire to help and protect now needs to be shifted completely to your child. For someone who has an addiction there is no reasoning with them. Your child is in danger while she is in the care of her mother. You should not have to turn your life upside down to accommodate your wife/girlfriend. I set those boundaries hard when i realized his addiction was something i was not willing to deal with or expose my child to for the rest of our lives, because this IS something you will constantly have to be lookong out for. Your interests should be in gaining sole physical custody of your daughter and getting cameras installed in your house/apartment if she is to continue staying there for safety purposes. If she absolutely refuses the cameras with audio then then that would be concerning. I know your not looking at ending your relationshio but trying to show her your supportive, but if you dont do anything by at least protecting your daughter from her then your daughter will be exposed to that toxicity. Think about it. How do you know her heroin dealer doesnt come to the house where your daughter is at? How do you know if one time she decides to get high she wont leave the needle within reach of your child? She needs to go back into rehab and you need to gain custody. I know this probably isn't what you want to hear, ive just been there and done that. I wish you and your daughter the best!!!"
From what I understand those tests are dangerous to the fetus and finding a doctor to do them for paternity only reasons is usually difficult. Just something to think about. 
I would then tell her that until further notice you will be removing her name from your account because you will not be her personal ATM. 
"Your boyfriend is an asshole. You literally ask, ""how will i go home without you, i thought we would go together?"" and he immediately leaps to ""fuck you""?!?!?!? He can't even calmly discuss ways to travel separately without yelling and cursing at you? Your boyfriend treats you like crap, hon. You can do better."
"Find her somewhere else to live near the hospital, or lock your room when you leave.  its your place you are in charge not her."
I was in a similar relationship in my 20s. I'm not going to spell it all out because it's really just very much the same kind of shit you described. I'll just say that breaking up was absolutely the best thing for both of us. Don't waste any more of your time one someone who doesn't make you a priority. Just... don't.
"He can't be home all the time, and her parents are supportive, and he has a VERY personally invasive employer. She has a lot going for her to get out of there compared to many people."
"Giving you some support. You're not overreacting. The way he's acting is more like a child than a partner. You could try showing him the emma ""you should've asked"" comic - it explains mental load and chores. But if this has been coming up over and over and nothing's changed, how long can you hit your head against a wall hoping to turn it into a door? Hug."
"When people first met my husband and I, they often assume we're recently married, not married for years. Despite everything that's happened since getting married: health problems for both of us, family drama, kicking any hills, and more, or relationship hasn't changed at all. We're still madly in love, deeply attracted to each other, and happy together. 

My husband still finds me very attractive, despite multiple pregnancies and associated body changes. He would have jumped my bones every chance he got through each one too if pregnancy didn't make me violently ill (just watching something move made me queasy). "
"Just leave, girl. Find the strength to move on. Block him on all your devices and be done with it. "
"You can break up with anyone you want for any reason or no reason. The only reason you need is that you dont want to be with that person anymore, and it really doesn't matter why. Having said that, this would be a dealbreaker for me personally.  Being a big old baby about food is a pet peeve of mine, and I dont give a fuck all day if that's petty. To me its not just about food. It has more to do with an unwillingness to adapt or change or mature. Rigidity of this nature makes *me* feel like this is a close-minded person, uninterested in anything beyond their own little box. 
To me (and many others, I think) food and culture go together, so being a food-jerk is a trait (or habit or whatever) that I find really unappealing. I understand that not everyone has to like everything- I dont. I hate broccoli and brussel sprouts and several other things. But I have tried them, and if someone is being hospitable and trying to share a little bit of their culture with me, I eat what they give me. I may not ask for seconds, but I eat it and i dont say awful, rude shit or make ""ew"" faces. Eating nothing but fast food and/or being a picky eater makes it harder to tolerate anything different until ""different"" becomes intolerable and NO THANKS. "
whippits kill your brain don't do them
What's his retirement plan? Is he planning on burdening you with his future bills?
She should give you a reason or at least talk to you about it.  Maybe she found someone and is afraid to tell you.  Idk. Good luck!
She's holding something back from you on what is in that account.  If she won't be fully transaprent I would go back to having seperate bank accounts from her.
"This is why I broke up with my last girlfriend, in her eyes it was ""showing love"" but to me it felt like Big-Brother watching over my every move and demanding to receive updates. 

You said you've been talking to this guy for 3 years. He is **visiting his kid**.  You say 12-15 hours like it's HUGE but the majority of that time was overnight when most people are sleeping. He said he was busy even! Why are your needs more important than his needs?"
"&gt;In those poorer countries, even a minimum wage job is more than they could make in years.

Um....you do know that the cost of living differs per country, right?"
You would be justified in kicking her out. 
"Not what I said, my friend. "
Time to kick her out and let her go live with his mom too.   You deserve better than this.   A good partner talks through issues.  They don’t cheat
"Hello, thanks for the reply. Sadly I sent him that comic as well as the ‘my wife left me because I didn’t rinse dishes’ or something like that and again, he acknowledges how little he does but it didn’t change anything."
"I think you're probably right.  I've already told my girlfriend what is going on, and she is being supportive of me.  (I had sex with the person now with child before we met.)"
"It will always be like this with him, and you know that. You’re unhappy, and wasting your time with someone who has some serious maturing to do. Break up with him so you have the opportunity to find someone who will treat you way better."
"You think all police develop a case prior to a search warrant? 

Milwaukee police office gets shot in no knock raid  approved over  the sale of a $20 &amp; $40 bag of weed.  No drugs recovered and they took $3k from a safe in the home.  

Dont assume the police are always doing to right thing, they are people and they fuck up too."
That’s just my opinion :) you’re welcome to feel differently. 
"I'd casually say, ""Hey, [very close friend of yours] told me they want to try [sex fetish here], what do you think?""

BDSM, anal, whatever, as long as it's something you've never done before (obviously it has to be something you're both interested in)."
"Sustainable relationships are built on basic compatibilities. This is just an incompatibility: you like trying new foods and she does not. You tried to coax her to try things your way and she’s not receptive. You do not want to live as she does (no fault in that, you’re just different people with different preferences!).

Speaking as someone who has struggled with weight issues - she’s made massive improvements to lose 100#. Saying “food is a difficult thing for me” translated into her having disordered thinking with food and she’s clearly had a past with binge eating. Maybe she’ll make improvements or maybe she’ll gain it back. The point is this is not someone who will ever be just like you with food. And that’s okay. It just means you two shouldn’t be together.

You don’t have to ever stay in a relationship where you don’t feel compatible. "
" It’s time to let him go; once a cheater, always a cheater in my books...  "
"&gt; I think part of him was worried that if I didn't move down now, I never would move


And the reasons for that are...? That maybe you really didn't want to move?


You get to say what you do with your own life. You are a democracy of one."
Could you please do research also on modern effective birth control methods ? Pulling out isn't on the list. 
"Why are you not concerned that someone 22 years older than you is in the same stage of life as you? And by the way, he IS NOT, if he is driving home drunk like it's normal, yet you aren't okay with it. He is going to be in the same stage of life as a 21 year old person for the rest of his life.

Find someone that's actually in the same stage of life as you. That wants to become a better person over the next 22 years, and by age 50 they are a person that's well put together. Someone that isn't driving drunk and avoiding conflict at age 50. He isn't able to do that. Why are you wasting your life?"
"It sounds like you read that on a website and didn't do a lot of real research.

Either way, let's say you're correct: that has nothing to do with what I just said. I said that she has to learn on her own to nourish herself and develop methods that work for her, and that OP can't force her to change her diet.

Additionally, it doesn't sound like OP wants her to eat 'healthier' per se, just different food. There are a lot of cuisines and restaurant meals that are just as 'bad for you' as fast food."
"She probably does have social media. Not a clue what it could be, though... I might ask my mum."
"That would be a deal breaker for me. She sounds very immature,"
"I mean I don’t know exactly. Me as a gay man, if I felt an attraction to one of my friends and the relationship we have, I would say something or ask. I have done that before. Also you need to do some self observation first. Could see yourself in a relationship with him. Could you see him as someone you want to come home to and kiss everyday. "
"If he is as great of a guy as you say he is, I’m sure you could have a delicate conversations where you bring up his strengths when it comes to oral and that you would prefer he do that more often, and maybe he will get the hint. You could also suggest using toys if you think that may help. 

You also have to evaluate if the lack of sexual chemistry is something that is a deal breaker for you long term or something you can adapt with. Open communication is important in relationships, so this would be a good opportunity to practice that! "
"Lol, I agree, now to find a slightly nicer way to explain it to him... :P "
"From the info you provided, it seems unlikely that you are the father, but if you have the financial means, it seems that a DNA test would be the most accurate way to quell any doubt. "
especially when the vast majority of that time-gap was overnight... when people are typically sleeping
"Man, you really will put this girl through any amount of pain and distress in order to avoid addressing your own problems, huh?  And yes, that includes abruptly ending a friendship that she considers important with a highly suspect ""it's not you, it's me"" excuse.

What's your plan?  To go live in a cave and avoid human contact so you can't be unreasonably cruel and nasty to anyone else?  How are you ever going to change and be happier if you give up instantly every time it boils over?  

It might help you to feel less helpless in the face of your own misanthropy to recognize that every word that comes out of your mouth is a choice you are actively making, and not an automatic reflex you cannot control like a heartbeat.  If you actually put some effort into making better decisions, including seeing a therapist to address the unhappiness that your behavior is rooted in, you would see some progress.

Your friend would undoubtedly be better off without your toxicity.  How about making yourself less toxic as a solution to this problem, instead of sequestering yourself like nuclear waste and letting your attitude fester?"
Maybe she thinks there is a chance of you two getting back together because the break up was due to circumstance 
"Yeah no that's just dumb. You know what your girlfriend is thinking? She's thinking she can't believe she's dating such an immature manchild, that it doesn't gel with whatever image you've presented to her when you're alone with her, so she's hoping that your mates are just a bad influence and if she gets you away from them you'll be the person she loves.

If it turns out that that's just the kind of person you really are, well she'll probably be asking herself some serious questions about your relationship.

TLDR; Putting your balls on stuff is childish and your girlfriend is disappointed in you."
"That’s one of the most difficult parts of this. I want to be able to introduce her to my family and have her eat the food my mom cooks, because I know the moment I bring her home and she doesn’t finish everything on her plate, that’ll be a hard no from both mom and dad."

"I've had this happen before with people who were superficially similar to me. You're both the new to the area - she perceives you as competition, as someone other people are comparing her to. If it isn't that bad - if she isn't outright hostile - kill her with kindness, like the other poster said. 

Use kindness with some meat or meaning to it, if possible, but nothing that leaves you too vulnerable--stuff she can reject with no harm to you. Agree with something she said in the group ""Miss Sharky makes a great point that really resonates with me. It makes me think about \[new idea\]."" Or approach her afterwards. ""I really like that you said \[whatever\]. It made me think about \[related personal but not TOO personal thing, like the things the chaplain said when my great-aunt died\]."" Be as genuine as you can. In my experience, something that forces her to look at you as a separate human being with thoughts and feelings and history, not just a set of comparisons to herself, can let the air out of that kind of conflict. 

I've done that and literally seen the person thaw in front of me. We don't become friends, but they aren't looking to fight anymore. 

That said, if she's super hostile and sends zingers your way in the group, the better bet is to talk to one of the other women in the group about it in a way that doesn't attack Miss Sharky at all. If she's openly hostile, they see it happening, and it probably makes them uncomfortable, too. Finding an ally and saying something like, ""Sharky has \[good traits\]. She doesn't need to be my friend, as long as she's nice, but some of the comments she makes make me uncomfortable--I wish I knew how to defuse the situation,"" will make you feel less uncomfortable when it happens. Maybe the person will be able to help, but even if they can't, the next time a zinger comes your way, you'll know people are seeing what she's doing - and not liking it. That's going to stop you from feeling so awkward, and make you see Sharky as the awkward one, playing some mean game that no one else wants to play."
"Break up with him. It's apparent you're not important, and likely you should have not gone back to him after that first breakup. "

"I saw that you're from a different culture as your SO. I am American, my boyfriend is Mexican. One of my greatest joys has been going to his house and experiencing what authentic Mexican food is, since it's a big part of who he is.

""Um no I'll just stick with cereal thanks. I don't like *ethnic*  food."" Nope. Nope nope nope. "
Ok thank you. Maybe I am seriously in denail or something. I plan now to talk with my mom to help make an exit plan for us.

You're 18 kid don't be so dramatic.
"please use condoms man, safe sex saves lives

if you think the kid might be yours and you can afford the test and she's cool with the blood draw, might as well. and if you're cool with the consequences of fatherhood"
That’s good to hear! Thank you. 
As a doctor you should know that it’s much easier to regain those pounds than it is to keep them off as the body resets metabolism to your higher weight when you gain weight.
You care at a level 10 and she cares at a level 2. Yea they are nice but it’s not a huge deal to her. So maybe make her 2 a week and then she can figure out the rest. Plus not having it every day will make her appreciate it more. 
Doesn't matter. No partner tells the other who they can be friends with. Even if she thinks what he did was childish. You don't micromanage another's life for them.
"Curious as to what you mean by ‘what she is’? It seems from the post that she does not believe him to be the father, has been honest about her relevant sexual history, and does not appear to be asking for financial support. "

Oh man this is me. I've recently realized it's all about control as well. Thank you for helping me put it into words. I totally understand and I'm 37F!!!!"

You really sound hypercritical and borderline hateful of sex work. Why do sex workers trying to have loving relationships upset and disgust you so much?
Just be happy you didn't stick around. Sounds bizarre AF.
But don’t you think it’s weird that he’s dreaming about a girl who only was his girlfriend for 2 months? 
"Your boyfriend is likely thinking he isn't capable of handling your issues. And to be frank, it doesn't sound like you are capable of being in a healthy relationship right now. Get yourself straightened out before jumping into another relationship."
"DO NOT TELL HIM. Please trust those of us who have been in scary situations before you - don't tell him. It's not worth the risk. Just leave.

I honestly wouldn't even wait until the weekend, but that's just me."
"I see all of these people in good relationships in school, in the media, around me and I feel lonley. I don't have someone  to touch or hold in that way. I don't have someone to care about me in that way and it feels like I'm missing out on something amazing. "
"I owned my house outright when my now-husbanded moved in. Even without a mortgage, and me making close to double what he did; I fully expected him to chip in and share some of the financial load. 

It costs money to live, and your BF shouldn’t be expecting a free ride. Your proposal is more than fair. "
"He's CLEARLY leaving because you lied to him and he can't trust you, not because you're in a difficult situation. He's been trying to help you this WHOLE TIME and you still didn't trust him. He's a keeper, and if you want to keep him you go and grovel right now and never lie to that man again &gt;:c"

"It's not controlling if OP is determined to use them as an excuse for his behavior. Telling someone they shouldn't hang out with specific people, if those people are a big part of the reason he's exposing himself in public and wiping his balls on other people's shit, is pretty par for the course. "
"That makes more sense! I would suggest just having a sit down conversation to lay out what you expect, and he can lay out what he expects, and then you talk. "
"Worked as a medical receptionist for eight years. Her body is going to start crapping out hardcore around 35-40. It’s okay to dump someone for being a shitty investment relationship-wise. Also, as a fellow lover of food, this would be like a musician who’s married to someone who violently opposes the idea of listening to any piece of music but “Baby Shark”.

It’s also indicative of a shitty, entitled, bratty attitude. Seriously? Pouting during a date because it isn’t at a Wendy’s? Immaturity is a huge turn off. I also wonder how she is about trying new experiences in general. Yeah, might have taken her three years to try broccoli AS A CHILD, but she’s a grown ass woman clogging her arteries with crap.

Love isn’t enough. Some people you love but they’re shit with money. Some people you love but they have zero ambition. A lover is one thing, a life partner is something else entirely. Get you a partner, not a lodestone around your neck. "

"Oh, he DID, did he? How cute of him. Okay, I'll play. 

Yo, Terrible STBEXBF, 

She posted this an hour ago, and there is not a SINGLE comment saying anything but to dump you. Not one person has even thought your relationship redeemable enough for some counseling--and that's a trope here. 

You are awful to OP. And you sound like not the best dog owner either. Your dog can't handle hiking due to uneven ground, but you had the brilliant idea to bring this dog to a mountain? Have fun, dude. 

You call OP names, you hang up on her, swear at her and care more about games than your girlfriend. 

And the icing on the sh!t cake that is you? You actually thought WE would call her names! 

Bye, Felipe"
Either accept that she's a sugar baby or break up. You don't get to make ultimatums 1.5 mos in. 
"What a sad situation. How involved was your dad with her after she stopped coming to visit? If she felt abandoned by him, she may not be too receptive to you. But you can always shoot her a message and see if/how she responds! "
"This sounds so sensible! And very much like something that I would be up for. I’m not sure how he would take to it as he might think it was me basically suggesting we were going to break up (he is quite sensitive about this!) but I think I’m going to try and suggest something similar, not necessarily to the same extent but some sort of agreement over larger items we might buy in future (need a new bed for example) and who they ‘belong’ to.  Thank you!  "
Thanks I will again tell her
"more of a street fighter myself 

&amp;#x200B;

HAAAADDOUKEN"
"That's exactly the point. Everything should be easy, happy, smooth sailing in the beginning. For months, even. For you to be able to write multiple paragraphs complaining about her behavior in the first WEEK is not a good sign. :/"
Fuck I’m crying thank you for the Baby Shark metaphor I needed a laugh this morning!
"I'm not a disc golfer but some of my friends are and it seems like a social, friendly crowd. Maybe there's a league or something you can get involved in? Does your girlfriend's interests align with yours or does she have a hobby that's just hers? Either way can be cool, but if there's something that's just hers she could find a group for? In a new city when you just have each other I think it's good to branch out and have your own thing. Also further expands your social circle if she can get to know people in her group and you do the same in yours.

Making friends as an adult is harder for sure. Almost feels more like dating in a way - people tend to be more cautious about who they invest time in as adults, and want to feel out whether it's worth it or not. Get used to asking dudes for their number lol."
You deserve so much better than someone like this. Leave him and find fulfillment elsewhere. 
"&gt; No, but I’ve even told her straight up that in the future I want to be able to take her to a new restaurant neither of us have been to before and have a good time. I want to be able to share experiences like that with her.

If that is not a future goal she shares with you, then you two are incompatible, at least in that respect. It doesn't make you a bad person to break up because of it. 

There are plenty of people she could meet who would be happy to eat fast food forever, and there are plenty of foodies you could date. 

I'm sure there are other aspects of your relationship that are great. What you need to decide is whether or not those outweight not sharing a love for new food experiences. If you decide that they don't, it would be more kind to break up now, than to stay together and grow to resent each other over the years.

"I am not unwilling at all, really. I am willing but I am out of ideas, hence the post. I have tried all the assistance available to me here and tried multiple ways of looking at this differently to think outside of the box. You might be misreading me. I wasn't here to complain, rather hear experiences or suggestions that might help me out. I'm not missing the point that I'm a big reason I'm in this situation. My main thing was wanting to know how to motivate him to step up to his boss or find a job that pays what he deserves. Not only for me but because he deserves it. There was a time where I supported him while he was getting his life together so it hasn't been one sided. I hadn't even considered leaving him though. Being in this situation for so long has made me lose a lot of confidence, self esteem and I honestly felt hopeless. "
"You've wasted a week on someone who has shown clearly that doesn't care for you. Don't waste another week, or month, or year, or a whole lifetime on her."
"I don't know exactly how much we spent. I think we spent around $1800 or a bit more on travel for two (plane flights, trains between cities, car rental+gas), and around the same on housing. Those were obviously the biggest costs. I definitely didn't spend the full $6k, but that was the starting budget. 

My intent wasn't to give a typical holiday figure, it was to give that I considered to be an upper bound of a once-in-a-lifetime travel vacation, when someone isn't trying to cut costs and instead is just maximizing their experience. "
"All you have to do is change some numbers like your ages and gender, no one would id you then. "
"Well, one I don’t have balls. And two, it was at a pub and they were just having some fun.

Chill dude. "
That’s a good idea actually thank you. I’ll warn him in advance that I plan to bring it up next week :) 
"What we(my x and I) did was very pragmatic. 

We calculated how much each person had after tax and pension payments.
Then we figured out what common expenses we had to pay: 
- It is her apartment. So we split the ""down the drain"" expenses and she payed reduction in loan her self
- Food we split 50/50 although I obviously eat more than her. Simply out of pragmatic reasons
- You dont even have to make a budget. Whenever you need more for food and expenses you each pay the same amount. 
- If something had to be bought for the apartment we did something smart. If it was going to ""stay"" in the apartment after we moved. She payed for it since she would be payed by the next buyer. 
If it was something  like a TV we decided who would get it if we ever split and then made a contract (email) that said. ""this item is bought together, in the case of splitting up X gets it and Y is payed [amount]-10% per year. It sounds formal but when we did actually split it only took an afternoon to get all finances in order. No discussion  about who gets what and how to split things. 
"
She has no right to tell him who he can be friends with.
"""who doesn't even have a job""

Not relevant tbh. You gotta get out of that mindset, man. There's more to being a good provider than having a job. It doesn't matter if you bring home the bacon when you don't take care of your wife's emotional needs.

You seem to recognize this yourself:

&gt;I'll be the first to admit... I have not been there for her as I should have. When she would be upset I would often get annoyed because I couldn't understand what she was so upset about. I should have been better but yeah.

Now, I should add though, that **all this doesn't mean that I think you're at fault for her cheating, because I don't, and you're not. Her cheating is 100% on her.**

But honestly man, it doesn't matter at this point. Your marriage is dead. You dealt with her depression pretty horribly, which drove a wedge between you two, and then she irreparably damaged your marriage by cheating on you. You say you had a pretty good marriage, but it sounds like your marriage has been pretty shit for years now. 

You had a pretty good marriage when things were easy, but when things got hard, you didn't know how to handle it. Which fair enough, we all have our shortcomings.. but yeah, she now knows she can't rely on you to be there for her during the difficult times. And even though you seem to recognize your failings, it also seems you still haven't fully learned your lesson.. because here you are, focusing on the fact that the guy has no job. It does not matter if he has a job, man. It doesn't matter if you have a job. A job is just that, a job. It's there to sustain the rest of your life. Good if you're happy or proud with what you do, but no one else gives a shit unless you're saving lives or w/e. Your wife doesn't give a shit either, not when you're getting angry with her for being depressed over losing several family members.

Sorry to be blunt. I know it's not easy dealing with someone who is just sad all the time. I'm actually more like you in that regard, but yeah.

Hey I'm just saying she has no place telling him he can't see his friends. Sure she can find what he did gross but forbidding him to see is buddies is pretty controlling.
He sounds like he is being financially responsible. Maybe stop pressuring him to have a huge wedding and an expensive ring.
Not sure how much any one remembers this but wanted to update everyone. She called me last night basically told me it’s over she loves me but says she isn’t good enough for me. Wants to still be my friend but no more I love yous or anything about that kind I stuff. I’m pretty hurt by it all and not sure what to do or think of this all cause I thought things were great we’d just had our I guess one year thing. Anyways just letting anyone who might be interested know.  Thanks again everyone.  
"Yeah, if she's amped it up since you began dating, she's definitely using you for this. Don't let her. You could call her out in front of people.

"Oh, I didn’t know about the council tax. Then I agree. I mean you could argue that he might choose not to get insurance if he lived alone, but I’m sure that’s not a major component anyway. In that case you could tell him that either he contributes to the insurance or his stuff is not added to your policy. 

As for the mortgage, no he shouldn’t pay the mortgage as such, but he should still pay rent that you can put towards your mortgage. The distinction is important because his rent should be determined by how much he would be paying to rent a flat or a room if he was not living with you. That may turn out to be less than half your mortgage. You guys should be able to negotiate to come to a reasonable figure on rent. All the other bills and things should just be 50/50."

"It sounds like the lunches were more about you than her. 

I get it. I show love with food too. It would hurt my feelings if I put a lot of effort into someone’s meals only to have them rejected in favor of gas station pizza. But that’s about *me* and what *I* like. If someone I care about prefers to receive love differently (or just not the way I like to show it), I’d make an effort to adjust. Because someone else’s lunch is not about my feelings. It’s THEIR lunch. 

That said, it WOULD be kind of her to meet you where you are once in a while. Drop the lunches, but once a couple of lunch-free weeks have passed, ask her to join you in the kitchen so you can cook *together.* She may not be the type to cook when left to her own devices, but it would give her a chance to see how much enjoyment you get out of the process, and perhaps motivate her to show you love the way *you* prefer.

"I study people and relationships. I also have studied religious groups and how they effect interpersonal relationships. A paper I’m working on publishing at the moment draws connections between religious communities, their education system presence, and unhealthy relationships dynamics due to lack of sexual education and discourse surrounding sexual topics.

Not a lot of people know what anthropologists do exactly, but we’re everywhere.

"Actually i have. I never texted him first throughout his trip, waited for him to text me first. This particular day that this happened, he was texting and as was I. Then he responded he is busy. So i left him 2 messages that he could read later and respond whenever he wanted. Not sure if he got mad that i didnt stop texting when he said that or what. But if someone is on their phone using Facebook and snapchat, pretty rude to ignore and not respond, even after x amount of time. If he wasn’t on his phone at all, another story. Even right now, we havent texted for 15 hrs. Not like I’m going to lash out on him next time we talk that you didnt text for x amount of hours because I know he is busy. My issue was never responding or acknowledging the texts even 12 or 15 hrs later, when he is usually good at responding."
"&gt; Would you quit your job for the relationship at this juncture? I am an escort (used to sugar) and I wouldn't. It sounds like she doesn't want to either.

Then what is your point? He should accept simply that his partner will have sex with another man for money, for it is a 'one in a million opportunity'? Your opinion I think on this is immature, and your view of having an 'SD' as reasonable or respectable work is very backwards.

You shouldn’t be living with this manchild. 

Perhaps not always, but generally speaking, people live with others how they live alone. If he is a lazy slob when he lives by himself, he is going to be a lazy slob living with you.

You can love someone and know that they won't be a good spouse for you.  Good therapy should help you make peace with your decision, though it sounds like you know what you need and want to do.

"It has only been a week since we became boyfriend and girlfriend, so I feel like this might be a bit unfair to do so soon.

What do you think?

"Your post is hard to follow with all of the misused 3rd person pronouns. I'm not sure who is he, she, him or her."
It’s funny how the people that you expect to fuck you over end up being the good ones and the people you trust are the terrible ones
"No idea where you live, but that is really low for a doctor in the US.  That is low for even starting salaries for doctors in the US."
You’re doing this of your own volition knowing it’s not something she necessarily needs or wants. She didn’t ask you. Find another act of service to show your love and stop with the lunches.

"Try relationship counseling. I know everyone here likes to shout divorce, but try to figure out why this happened, figure out her point of view, try to understand everything, and if after that you think divorce is the option go to that. Don't be hasty. "

"&gt; My boyfriend has cheated on me throughout our 3 year relationship. 

He's using a bad upbringing to excuse being an asshole, get out of this relationship please!"
"Maybe try to see if he’s depressed? I was like this with my ex and needless to say, her saying that I never did enough for her (sexually/romantically) didn’t help, because it was something I had no control over. When I was depressed my sex drive was nonexistent and being a good partner was emotionally draining, so sometimes I’d need time to relax or time to focus on stuff outside of the relationship. This is all just my suggestion on the matter."
"Yeah love is never enough especially when relationships turn abusive, but it's not bullshit in and of itself."
"Have you broken down those monthly expenses for your partner so he can see that you're breaking even each month? If you've been paying the majority of expenses in the relationship, and you own a house, and you have a lodger already there, he may be under the false impression that you're financially leaps and bounds ahead of where you actually are, thus you asking for him to contribute for utilities comes off as money-grubbing. 

How much is he currently paying in rent, if anything? What do his own monthly expenses look like? I don't think £200-250 is unreasonable on its face, but it could also be a lot, depending on one's circumstances. If the number is the issue for him, maybe you can booth compromise a bit and lower the amount slightly.

With all that being said, if you outline all this to him and he still insists he shouldn't have to contribute anything, I would honestly not let him move in. Him living there for free while you shoulder all the expenses of the house would likely become a point of resentment. It's the kind of thing that ruins relationships.

"Man its true like i completely understand your reaction when i found out i felt like shit. I have actually thought about that before, that some of these guys possibly paid her but i could never ask her that question... its been left now and i dont think i could bring any of it up again we agreed to leave it all in the past.  It is just a matter if i can forget about it for good but its taking a while.

Its not guaranteed that she has passed something on to me but she was the one that suggested it as a possibility. Ill be fucked off if i have caught something like. I rang the sti clinic this morning after nightshift and i was stuck in a queue for 40 minites with an automated voice constantly saying more than 5 people are in the queue so i gave up. Clearly everyone is riddled around this area i did not expect them to be that busy and i rang them the second they opened! Ringing for my blood tests in doctors at  half 2 when they re open. "
He told you to fuck off when you asked how you were getting to your vacation. He sounds horrible OP.
"I kept bringing it up and it bothered him is all. We thought a third party whos unbiased would help. He’s a fantastic boyfriend in pretty much all the time though, no worries "

"Sadly I think you’re making the right decision by paying attention to the abundance of red flags waving in your face. I’ve been lurking on the r/justnoso r/justnomil and r/justnofil subs for a while now. 
EVERYTHING you have outlined sounds like a recipe for disaster. If you want even more opinions from folks who have gone through this sort of thing first hand, I recommend you check them out.
The years of stress, heartache, boundary stomping and entitled behavior will only get worse with a partner who is so deep in the FOG that he is already disregarding your emotional distress even before you get married. 
Sorry to not have more a positive spin on the situation :-("
"I have considered this too and yes she involves me in other aspects of her life, which has made me involve her more. Sometimes it does feel like we are too involved and everything I do or plan she needs to know about and if I haven't told her she feels hurt by it. I'm questioning other aspects of our relationship after these comments, thank you."
"I wouldn’t consider this a flaw. Be vulnerable, the right person will love you for who you are. "
"Yes. I have a nice house...part of why bills are so much. 

My thinking exactly. "
"She didn't have to volunteer this information. So that's a good sign that she did. I must disagree though when you say you are exclusive. As long as she is seeing her SD you are not.

If I were you I'd ask her to be truly exclusive if it bothers you so much. She will either choose you or her own convenience. That's something you will have to live with but it's better than feeling not important enough to the girl you want to be with. "
"Good idea, a lot of it has been through text so that should be easy. "

It *is* obvious, however, that you don't fully grasp what rejection means if you think it's up-to to you to choose a path."

Im not entirely sure about my friend here, he might be depressed, might not be. He has plenty of friends and makes me think that hed rather open up to them instead of me.

"Leave. Your fiancé is not ready to leave his father and relies on that guys approval for his future. This man will be the third partner in your relationship. Financially, you've already seen the fallout. Find someone who can be a partner to you, this guy will need years of NC with the parent to stop the codependence. And if his whole family is like this...you're going to be very alone if you continue this relationship. "
I don’t understand why you’re dating this asshole? Dump him. You’re worth way more than this crap. 
How does it get ugly?
"I understand your stance on the matter and appreciate it. I only disagree with the last part. I don't really care about what she provides because she does provide. I am only speaking on terms of the relationship itself and how couples should function.

She has supported my plan to get this Macbook because I already have work to get done on it. This is where it is tricky because she wants me to get it, but then again, the mean stuff she said to me kinda contradicts her idea of supporting me to get it. I dont know"
"OCD is an incredibly severe mental illness and I really hope people don't use this thread to bash people with it who are really trying to live with and recover from it.

But that said OP, your GF had a job etc and was managing (even if she was really struggling) usual markers of an adult life until she moved in with you. The fact she also didn't disclose the OCD until after she moved in and she yells at you and makes you change to fit her without trying to explain what the rules she expects you to follow are makes this problematic AF.

She may well be very mentally ill and in need of treatment but you are not obligated to put up with her abusive behaviour in the meantime. She is asking you to set yourself on fire to keep her warm and that's going to burn you out and also enable her OCD so isn't goo for either of you.

She's making you feel completely responsible for another grown adult and is being manipulative and cruel. And this is three weeks into moving in when most people (even those with mental illnesses) are usually trying to be on their best behaviour, compromise and generally set good patterns. 

She's gone straight for screaming, shouting and emotional blackmail before even a calendar month is up. Do you think that's going to get better without some serious change and effort from her? (Spoiler alert: it isn't. It's just going to get worse and worse.)

The longer you stay in this relationship, the worse it will get and the harder to leave. Give her notice, free yourself and let her get on with supporting herself."
"In almost every workplace it is prohibited that a supervisor and direct report become anything but professional. It’s unethical and one of you *will* likely be fired in the end, if not both. "

Only OP can guess the outcome though.

"Please, *please* talk to him about how you feel. Otherwise you'll start to resent him for it and the relationship will fall apart. This *can* be fixed and if he cares about you, he will be willing to work towards something. In a relationship, you become a team, and you have to trust that he is a reliable member of that team. How can you possibly have kids with him someday if you don't feel you can rely on him? Let him know that, though. He can't read your mind. And you need to look after yourself too. You have depression as well. 

I don't think you will feel better being single. I certainly don't. "
You take the risk no matter the amount of protection used.

"You just read a heap of terrible advice that doesn’t take one very obvious fact into account- your mom is abusive. She’s so abusive your sister cut her off. She calls your stepmom a whore. She screams at you in public. She manipulated you through verbal abuse and guilt.

You’re absolutely mad if you think you can do well in school in such an environment. It’d be much wiser to stay with your father. She can and will tank your mental health if you stay with her. "
I apologise. I'm sorry.
"Sort of. You were vague, which he's going to take as a non-positive and may take as an almost-rejection. But you didn't shoot him down, which I suppose is good.

This is all a bit silly. You both seem to be on the same page with this, but unable to clearly discuss this issue. What you should do is tell him something to the effect of, ""Hey, you really got me thinking the other day about us, and a future with a family, and I really liked it. Can we talk about that more?"" That conversation should progress and move you two forward.

Literally no one but you thinks they are defending the abused.  Your reading comprehension leaves something to be desired.
"I am SO glad to hear you are at your grandparents. Now, please consider the following... 

Ask your grandparents to fight to keep you. Ask them to get child protective services involved. Ask to enroll in school and counseling. If you are in the United States, your grandparents can take you to the local district and ask for you to receive an ""unaccompanied youth"" designation and to be enrolled under the McKinney-Vento Act. Tell them you have fled a domestic violence situation and are living with extended family who do not have guardianship. Tell them you need help staying out of an abusive home. 

I have three kids (11,12,14) and we just took in my 19 year old niece from a similar situation. She never finished high school because home life got so bad. Never got her driver's license either. Hadn't been allowed to have a friend over in the last five years. Had no idea what it was like to live in a world without constant put downs and hyper-critical expectations. 

She's getting a second shot at life. She enrolled as a junior in our district, the first time in her life attending public school. She's got her license and an old beater car. She has friends, she goes to counseling. She is safe here. She is loved and valued here. She's healing.

Because of the McKinney - Vento Act and because she fled an abusive home, we could enroll her in school even though we are not her legal guardians. She also qualified for food stamps (which helps offset the costs of adding a fourth kid to our household) and a monthly cash stipend from the state for clothing, gas, personal items, etc. She gets medical assistance (health insurance) at no cost and as long as she keeps her grades in the B range, she'll qualify for nearly free college.

You have options. But they have to start with you, and your grandparents fighting for you. Show them your posts here. Let them read the comments. Ask, beg, PLEAD for them to help keep you safe.

Feel free to DM me if I can be of any help. I had to learn a lot, very quickly to get my niece all of these services and I'm happy to do what I can to help you and your grandparents navigate this process."

The child doens't deserve the possible fallout of going through this when he is older and can understand how big of a mess this is. The natural father of the child deserves a chance to have a relationship with his son."
"Sounds like r/AsianParentStories. Blimey...

Take a moment and consider: is living at your grandparents a better situation for you? If so, is it possible to make it a more long-term arrangement?

I mean, it seems your grandparents are on your side and are about making you mentally healthy as well as physically. To me, they seem like they're a better fit than your mother ever was.

Also, just something to think about, but I have to wonder if your mother's toxic behavior is why you're so withdrawn. Personally, it took until my 30s to realize I'm actually an extrovert, but my adoptive mother had been so toxic, it'd been buried under social anxiety. She had made interacting with other people so hellish that I still have trouble talking with other people, despite craving it."
"Oh honey I'm so sorry... Your grandparents sound amazing. Stick with them. I'm so sorry you're going through this. I don't have any advice, but my heart is breaking for you"
"Why are you asking the internet this question?

 When do you think HE would want you to?

 Considering you're both teenagers, the answer is probably asap

"
"Reading your post reminded me(21m) of things things I faced with my parents. It's good to see your family stand up for you and trying to reason with your mom instead of just being quiet. Your mom is an unreasonable person it seems, whatever you do she doesn't seem satisfied. It's really hard to live with such moms and being raised by them makes you learn things wrongly. And the worst part is, your behaviour can't be bad to them, as then, it becomes a new issue.

The main immediate problem I see right now is your diet, as a teen eating enough is important so that growth is not stunted. Some teens have the blessing of not putting on weight at all while some  look fat even after not eating enough. I'm in the latter category and you seem so too. I've noticed that maybe reaching the perfect figure is gonna be really hard, but I can maintain a lil chubby but not too overweight body with some brisk walking everyday and eating 4 meals a day, 2 eggs and one meal chicken almost everyday (point being, its possible to eat enough and be health without too much effort). So schedule some physical activities and fix the diet.
About the diet, I think the only way out might actually be to talk to a professional. But, yeah, it'd be game over if your mom controls the conversation with the dietician as I feel that she's good at putting out the points she feels are correct and drive a emotional truck over what other people are trying to say. There's actually the obstacle of actually getting her to talk to a dietician, which would need to be done really tactfully otherwise she can take it like, ""so you are telling me what to do?"" or ""how dare you think my methods aren't sufficient"". Family help might be necessary.

Now, the long term problem is the way your mom is raising you, in the emotional control freak way, making you feel bad about anything you do. My mom did that too along with beating and all. So, I worked hard in high school (studies was the only thing my parents expected me to do, 24x7), got a chance in the best science university in my country which is in a city 2½ hour flight away from my home city, and just shifted to the hostel here. I guess, you can follow a similar route, leave the house for better opportunity. I'm sorry I really can't advise about child helplines or things like that as I really had no idea things like them existed at that time and dunno much about them even now.

And, most importantly, don't fall apart. What you did was a valid reaction, be proud that you raised your voice against something wrong (never did that myself)"
You are so incredibly ignorant I hope to God you’re not studying this with any intention to go on to treat people.
"I’d stay with Grandparents indefinitely, from what I read about narcissism, it is something that can’t be cured, unfortunately they very rarely change. Best to keep a distant relationship with her."
"The bullied kid will have a problem with food for the rest of their life, likely."
"Your mom should be in fucking jail.  She's an evil rotten person.  FUCK YOUR MOM.  THIS ASSHOLE IS GOING TO RUIN YOUR LIFE.   


You should never speak to that horrid woman again.  I mean it.  SHE IS ABUSING YOU.

Goddamn I'm so mad I want to call CPS on your behalf.   Good luck- this won't get better until you get your evil terrible mom out of your life.  Please seek help- at school, therapy, maybe your grandparents?  Maybe not but maybe.... seriously, you need this horrid witch out of your life"
"It sounds like you don’t think sex with you is special for her, because she’s been with other men. That’s probably completely false. If she loves you, then it’s different every time. Each person is different, so don’t assume that you’re gonna be the exact same experience as her previous partners. Talk to her, explain how you feel. Be honest back to her. If honesty was her goal, I think she’ll appreciate it. "
"I was even worse, 130lbs at 6'4. Wasn't because I had an eating disorder,.I just ate too few calories for a years on end. Even now I'm reached a healthy weight I have no appetite. Some people just aren't wired to enjoy or crave food. I have to consciously make myself to eat."
Talk to her about it. 
"I disagree. It wouldn't be OP's business had her friend kept her secrets to herself, but her friend essentially made it OP's business. She brought her friend into it and now her friend has every right to do the right thing and tell the truth of what she knows. "
"I mean, you already know her job situation, and you know there’s a good chance that she won’t eat your packed lunches. I think she was just trying to not hurt your feelings when she said she didn’t view them as you overstepping. 

Just don’t pack lunches and make meals only when you know she’d definitely eat. The lunches are a nice idea but really only if someone can eat them and it doesn’t sound as if her schedule allows for that."
"Yes this. It is possible for older folks to learn, so see if that works before reducing contact. Tell your dad about your girlfriend and your expectations for if you introduce them. See what he says. If he can learn to behave, great. If not, he doesn’t get access to that part of your life."
"You are 15, and you have a better sense of boundaries and a shinier spine than almost any grownup I know. Im so proud of you standing up for yourself.

You have absolutely nothing to apologise for, and if you did apologise your mother, would only interpret that as a sign of her being in the right, treating you with such disrespect, reducing you so much and taking away your dignity in front of other people. Clearly your mother has some issues. But they are hers to figure out, not through you, but on her own.

If I were you, I would appeal to my grandparents. Beg them if you have to, to let you stay with them. Offer to do chores. - emphasize how much it means to you to have 3 meals every day, how much it helps you think at school and has improved almost every aspect of your day because you have more energy. Play on the fact that your mother starves you if you must. Socially engineer all your ammunition as much as you can, because you dont want to live in that toxic house of hers if you dont have to.

Maybe you could hint to your grandparents, that you dont see yourself having much of a relationship with your mother in a few yrs when you are legally an adult, because she has never respected you as your own person and only berates you and strips you of your dignity. Hint that you think your life might be better without her there to peck at your selfesteem all the time. - THAT will get your grandparents attention because the fact is you ARE 15, going on 16, and they dont have a lot of time left. When you are an adult, you can leave your mom and dad behind if you decide to do so. 

Be kind to your grandparents. Offer to help out as much as you can. If they have a garden offer to work in it, if they need cleaning offer to help. ANYTHING to make yourself a positive input in their lives. Anything to make your mothers position rocky. Let your actions speak louder than words."

"It's all basically the same thing. Cold reading is harder, I think, because the other stuff provides stimulus for the person being read to react to, so there are more visual cues for the reader to pick up on. I'm convinced that the best psychics have an innate talent for observing and interpreting non-verbal communication and are just freakishly insightful. They might believe they have spirit guides or whatever but I think they are their own guides- for the most part. I dont NOT believe that a person could be psychic, though. I mean... someone *could*, maybe. "
My post was perfectly fine.
"Cancel. The best case scenario if you go is that you both realise it's a bad idea and leave it.


The worst case scenario is you start dating. Your coworkers start to hate both of you because he favours you even when he tries to remain unbiased. Suddenly everyone at work treats you differently. They don't take you seriously. He gets promoted and your job stagnates because no one views you for the work you do; they view you as his girlfriend. You miss that promotion that you deserve because it would look like a nepotistic move. Etc. "
"How does he treat your girlfriend? If he's not nice to her because of her race or tries to break you up, then yes I think cutting him out of your life is a good choice."
"It is not good that this girl is talking to her boyfriend about sleeping with other guys.  I wouldn't like it, you wouldn't like it, no guy wants to hear about his girl going down on another dude."
"You cannot judge that someone ‘most likely’ has a personality disorder from one post on the Internet. Furthermore, you cannot judge that someone is ‘most likely’ untreatable from one post on the Internet. There are loads of studies that show personality disorder treatment can be effective. You literally say in another comment you ‘don’t believe’ people can be treated, which is just ridiculous. If you really are studying personality disorders, you will know that to get a diagnosis people have to report a history spanning years of symptomatic behaviour and that the diagnosis is a work in progress. So throwing that kind of label around as ‘most likely’ from one text post is very irresponsible and stupid.

It’s damaging because these kind of comments are extremely blasé in throwing around serious mental health labels, making the illness seem casual or insignificant, whilst saying it’s most likely untreatable again promotes stigma against personality disorders that people with them can’t change or learn to manage their disorder. That’s why it’s harmful.

You COULD say, ‘This person seems to be displaying a lot of signs of xxxx. It would help them to discuss this with a professional and see what treatment options they recommend.’ But saying someone ‘most likely’ has a disorder and is untreatable is as stupid as commenting that someone most likely has stomach cancer when they are complaining about symptoms of a stomach ache, nausea and vomiting."
You don't have to tell anything you don't want to. It's up to you what you divulge. Although being vulnerable can bring two people closer together.That is what relationships are about. Learning about each other and accepting them for who they are.  f you don't want to talk about it though just steer things towards another topic or just say you don't really want to talk about that subject.
"&gt; What precautions can I take because we have all heard the don't shit where you eat.

The precaution to take is *don't shit where you eat*. That IS the precaution! Not exactly subtle, but that's the whole point. It gets the message across. You moved there for work and study reasons, so don't jeopardize your work situation before you're even well established."
Reading that part almost was almost the worst. The daughter can't do anything right according to mom.
"That’s one of the dumbest things I’ve heard.

Therapy only works for personality disordered people when they recognize something is wrong.

If they don’t think they’re doing anything wrong with the abuse they dish out on the regular, all therapy does is teach them new ways to abuse someone.

If I thought you knew what you were talking about? You’d be much more dangerous. As it is, you’re still ridiculous and dangerous to suggest therapy. That gives Mom more ammunition to abuse the OP."
She's a 15 year old girl.
All I’m doing is pulling you up on your irresponsible determination that OP’s mother probably has an untreatable mental illness. The fact you’re now trying to imply I’m encouraging OP to ‘keep being abused’ is laughable. Like one of the worst straw man comments I’ve ever seen. 
"Your mum is out of line, and damaging both your relationship with her and your mental and physical health.

Don't apologise. See if you can stay with your grandparents as they seem to be supportive. Your grandmother especially seems to know your mum is in the wrong, hence her comments. "
"Yeah, not. My Uncle was 39 when he married my friend, who was 18. He's a great guy. He just spent his late teens and 20's building his career, buying a house, paying it off, getting a degree while working 60+hrs a week, and preparing to provide for a family. He wanted a younger wife who would be able to have a large family. Met her, she's always been a lil old lady in a young person's body, they fell in love, were compatible, and got married. 25 years and 4 grown kids later, they're still going strong. The way he loves her is just.. I don't have words. "
"He offered to go with you and you told him no? That’s the only thing I find off about this. I get that he doesn’t enjoy the music but if he’s concerned for your safety and wants to go with you to make sure you can safely have a great time why not let him? What’s wrong with him being there? If he’s going to complain the whole time that’s one thing but it doesn’t sound like he’s necessarily saying ‘you shouldn’t go at all’ just that he doesn’t like the idea of you alone at a concert for 5-6 days. Let him come. Give him a chance and tell him he better shut up and try to enjoy it if you think he’ll be complaining the whole time. Edm has a wide variety of music out there, you never know what he’ll end up hearing and enjoying given the chance. "
Really dont stay in a relationship out of pity or because you feel you owe it to them. I did it for 4 out of 5 years and its the biggest regret i will ever have.
"No, absolutely he has my trust. It was a moment of panic. But I still feel bad for panicking at all.

I didn't accuse him of anything and he showed me the other messages sent from his account and the apology of the old fling by his own accord, I didn't ask or demand to see it."
I agree somewhat. Should I cancel Friday?
I'm opting for advocating for getting rid of it. 
"Your own family call you annoying? Good heavens. There is a lot of toxicity here and you have been nothing but a sensible and mature person. Here, have a a jelly baby "
Yes! She needs to know her mom is sick! 
"Apologize for what?? Your grandparents seem like lovely people, stay with them untill your mom (excuse my French here) gets her head outta her ass. Talking to a young woman like this can destroy her, just because she has body image issues does NOT make it okay to project it on you, wait for your mother to reach out.

"My mother used to do this. I'm French, so I wasnt allowed to be fat. I was anorexic and bulimic at 16, and I was underweight. My mother and father would keep calling me fat, controlling my food, everything. 

My heaviest was 125kg at 1.69m tall. I'm now 11kg. My lightest was 45kg. 

I stopped talking to my parents in '16. Best choice I ever had. Dont be scared.

If you need anyone to talk to, you can always PM xx"

Yes and possibly being depressed because your mom criticizes anything you do.

Ok so we know your mom is crazy but your dad needs to grow a backbone and protect you from this terrible behavior.  She is literally keeping you both walking on eggshells to be in favor of her temper!! Don’t apologize ever. You have done nothing wrong. Please let your grandparents know the full extent of this situation and go back to therapy (check out a diff therapist though.) Try and live with your parents and reenroll into public school. You can do it!!!
"BMI can be very misleading. If you are muscular or have a large bone structure, it will say you are overweight even if you are fit. If you have a skinny bone structure, but carry too much fat, it will say you are perfect. "

"My boyfriend is pretty allergic to all things with fur. Xyxal has really helped him a lot with pet allergies. He mostly stays with his grandma or his mom, both have dogs, but those dogs also don’t jump around or on him or his stuff. I’m not sure what you can do about your family, but you could also lock the dog out of your bedroom, try to give yourself a safe space where the dog won’t be, and maybe if you can manage your allergies some you can help/encourage training of the dog with the family so he doesn’t jump around or bother you as much."
Don't pee where you eat. It's not a good idea.
How did you get the courage to tell a doctor? Did they believe you or write you off as picky? I have an awful diet and am apparently an awful wife and mother because of it. My husband actually gets it and so do my kids since one of them did feeding therapy and we all went together. I'm really candid about my issues with them and how I want more for them. I've come to realize that I'm likely autistic and have ARFID. My autistic child does better in feeding therapy than I could ever hope. Sometimes I have to look away when he touches certain foods because the sight of him touching them makes me gag. I get that I need help but after years and years of noone believing me I'm scared to try to talk to a medical professional.
Get out. Keep ur savings to urself. Have a different life. Help ur father with what he needs (without money). 
"But the girl is in my class and we will be in the same office once a week and doesn’t have the opportunity to use a car. So I’ll tell her when she will ask me take the base 1.5 hours instead of joining me? And the same after we finish?

"This isn't a date, first of all, and secondly, don't agree to be someone's friend if you can't handle it or don't want friendship.

Frankly, I think you should focus on other prospects for now. "

"I'm not saying this is a great thing to happen at all. I'm not saying the father is obliged either. I'm stating what could be the result and what OP can blame themselves for later.

"Cutting off contact with no explanation would be a weird and unhelpful leap, but the sentiment that this is something that bothers you deeply enough to consider it is appreciated and understood. 

I'm Chinese Canadian living in a large city and I know of Asian groups doing anti black racism.  a few years ago a letter circulated the Internet explaining anti black racism in Asian communities and the letter was translated into a variety of East Asian languages (Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean etc).

It's not clear based on your post if you have tried to approach him yet. "
"Awww idk why i was smiling reading this. This sounds so cute hahaha

Just relax and approach him casually and say “hey there, how are you? i see you often here. Would you mind if i have your number?” 

Whats the worst that can happen? A rejection at most? Its not end of the world even if he does say no. So relax and good luck :)"

Wait for your mom to realise her mistake. She doesn't seem to know how to treat her kids at all. 
"I would wait until I turn 18 and GTFO of there. Between your dominative mom (maybe a bit narcissist? Check /r/raisedbynarcissists) and your other passive parents, there's no good outcome for you.

Actually, it's either your mom can't accept you're growing up (best case scenario which can be diffused by a honest conversation with her) or she just want control over you (narcissist, GTFO).

Hang on, and don't apologize! You didn't choose to cry to embarrass them! They embarrassed themselves and are pretty cruel about it.

Actually the more I think about it the more narcissist mom seems to fit."
Yeah I’m getting that now too. I’m gonna try to dig into it

"I read a study a long time ago too. I thought it was more like 30% in Georgia. I was shocked but not really. It happens more then you think. 

I saw it first hand from a mother at school, not a friend. She was divorced (amicably for a couple years - really nice guy). Got pregnant and engaged to a man (really nice guy very involved with her child from first marriage).... Baby was born..... Baby looked exactly like her child from first marriage.... It was startling they could have been twins. They looked just like the first husband.  Fiancee dumped her about 6 months later, she went back to first husband. That did not last either. 

OP, I would stay out of it and find a better friend.  If she cared about you, she would not have burdened you with this. I think the husband might know or have suspicions. This is her mess to deal with."
"No but she is exhibiting alot of symptoms in the dsm. Also, I didn't diagnose; that's why I said ""most likely""."
"What are you getting out of this relationship exactly?
"
"If she’s an insecure person, she might be identifying herself solely by traits you share. A healthy person would use your similarities to bond and form a friendship. An insecure person will feel threatened that you’re “stealing” their identity just by existing, even moreso if you’re a self-actualized person who knows who you are outside of “mom of one-year-old and wife of professor husband.” If this is the case, everything you do or say will make her feel bad because she compares herself to you and you make her feel inferior and lost. So, like a scared puppy or middle schooler, she’s going to lash out any way she can to try to bring you down a peg below her so she feels better. It’s immature and obvious. And it has nothing to do with you.

You gotta find a way to ignore her. Continue to make more one on one connections with your new church friends and spend your energy helping those connections blossom. If you’re stuck in a group conversation with her and she makes a snide comment, kill her with kindness in return. But try to avoid getting stuck in any conversation with her. As for how to stop caring, I think the first step is to reframe your thinking. It’s not about you. It’s not personal. She’s like a little wounded animal who is scared and is trying to bite at you to protect herself. You’re not her friend or therapist, so it’s not your place to help her, so just avoid her and pray for her. Reframe her dislike as a reflection of herself in your mind, and you’ll stop feeling bad about her comments towards you and start pitying her. Once she stops getting a reaction (or gets a pitied reaction instead), she’ll probably learn to not mess with you. "
The just thing is to tell the husband. 
"I kind of just want to give you a hug from reading all that? I mean, I’m probably almost the polar opposite, whenever I feel down or upset I crave people and company. 
I honestly think these kind of needs and attachment styles are both innate and also influenced by our upbringing. Why don’t you do an experiment? Stay away from internet porn for a month. It probably doesn’t sound ideal to you but hell, see how far you can push yourself and see if it make any changes to your perspective/desires. It’ll be super interesting to see what it takes to knock that Great Wall of yours down. "
Imagine being this dense
"Yeah well i'm a guy so i can take more physical abuse than she can right? I badly regret tearing her shirt cos she mentioned respect and that i didn't respect her and all because i tore her shirt. I do agree if there were other people and i tore her shirt it would be worse but it was in the room. It still is disrespectful but i was so freaking mad i swear i couldn't control it. 

Thanks for your comment "

Take a good diet, with enough protein 100 grams or so, enough calories so your body doesn't starve. I tell you this as someone who was fat and wanted to change, I started doing a little sport and a hard diet, it was strict but I was eating the most in the last years.

"I think you have to look at it as the difference between online dating and meeting at a bar or club.

I assume online you had a list of common interests that matched you or you ended up drawn to one another as such. I believe in those cases, our “type” as human beings becomes less based on looks and more on interests and personality. Whereas meeting people on the street becomes more about the physical presence and the decision to make an approach. We make assumptions about others for various reasons when all we have to go on is initially appearance. We all have “comfort zones”. Some people will never approach someone of another ethnicity, someone with a child, someone with tattoos, etc. etc. One of the few positive things about online dating is matching interests get people to say “you know what, here’s a cool person who I might not give a second thought to IRL”.

I wouldn’t dismiss the dude out of hand. He may feel he’s trying to open up a real moment with you and it came off wrong and clunky. It’s a learning experience, for him, and I don’t think it’s a bad thing unless he dwells on it again and again."

Cheers. I just want to be able to get a proper sleep again. 
"Thank you. I think you are right! And unfortunately I’ve already set a bit of a precedent, because I have definitely been very generous up to now, never charging him for petrol/parking despite that fact I usually cycle when I’m not with him, buying most of the food (we each stock our own house but he probably eats dinner with me at least 5 days a week, sometimes every day), usually I pay if we eat out or get takeaway, etc. 
So I definitely feel like at this point, if I don’t put my foot down then it will lead to problems in the long run. 
I think I’m just second guessing myself because I am very anti- ‘mean greedy landlords’ and try to be as fair as I can, not charging loads just because I can. 
For my current lodger, the amount they pay is very reasonable compared to similar rooms available nearby and I tried to be fair with price. For example before I bought my house, I was paying £50 more for a smaller room, in a 3 bed house with a shared bathroom nearby. Mine is a 2 bed and the room I rent out is a large en-suite. £500 includes all the bills, internet, council tax (which is £120 a month on its own!) and a cleaner.  

I do think having a lodger complicates things slightly, because they currently pay ~50% of everything. That’s why I’m asking a lower amount of my partner, because it’s basically around 50% of the amount I have left to pay after the lodger, rather than 50% of the actual total if that makes sense. "
"Imo, don't try to please her. Instead work on not being intimidated by her and on this relationship not affecting other relationships you have. 

Sometimes people just don't like you for random reasons. Other times they see you as competition and snide remarks are part of related hostility. Whatever the case, you should be polite and respectful. If it is the latter, going out of your way to please her is loosing strategy.

If it got worst after going to work, she might be jealous/resentful on you going to work. You are about to have social contact and all those other things one normally lacks at home. That is something she should work on however, not you."
"I’m going to give you some tough love OP - this ‘beautiful relationship’ you’ve had sounds very one-sided. Your boyfriend has supported you through serious mental illness, a suicide attempt and now the bombshell that you’ve been lying to him throughout your relationship, and actually have 10k worth of debt. You’ve come clean and are facing your issues which is great, but doing the right thing and doing something that’s good for YOU doesn’t eclipse the fact it’s not good for other people. You talk of it as ‘your’ hardship but it actually belongs to both of you - he’s emotionally supported you through hard times, he’s given you $1,500 and he’s now facing the reality that you outright lied to him your whole relationship. I don’t think he’s wrong to leave to be honest, finally admitting ‘I screwed up’ doesn’t owe you forgiveness or support from someone it affected."
No need to read further op. I know you want hope but this person laid it out the way it is. 
"&gt;I owe it to him to at least have a long chat about it rather than just cutting off contact.



I just want to say, no you don't.



If you didn't have a crush on him, what would your opinion of his actions be? 



Like a friend tells you a story about how she is playing a game with their guy friend (a guy friend who is in a relationship no less), and the guy friend starts talking about sexual things and touching himself to her, even though she did many clues any adult would pick up on saying she did not like it. Would that not just be creepy as fuck? Like creepy in a ""block them forever"" way? Would she *owe* anything to that guy friend?




You seem easily able to dismiss anything he does bad as a mistake, when he is a 25 year old grown ass man. He knows that sexting you is wrong because if he didn't he would be clinically stupid. And you said that you can tell a clear pattern of him ramping up how inappropriate he is with you, but still think he deserves the benefit of the doubt?



If he is the type of guy, to sext with another woman, and still think that he isn't hurting anyone, then he is either an asshole or unbelievably stupid. Either way that should make you question being friends, nevertheless want to date him and be the next woman cheated on."
"That is fair enough, you don't have to. After she told me that, she said i need to ring up and book in with the STI clinic in the hospital because they cant do much for me apart from check my bloods for other infections that might be the cause. I left the room and went to the treatment room where i had 4 blood tests done. It has been 4 days so i will ring them today and see what they tell me. I honestly do not know why they cant do proper STI testing at my doctors but it is what it is. "
It's good you don't need any of that because they wouldn't be any help 🤣
"Honestly I disagree with all these comments. She might be burnt out, dude. Y'all talk ALL the damn time and hang out ALL the damn time. When is her ""me"" time between you and homework? She finally gets to breathe her own air and you still try to breathe down her back. I challenge you to let her be the first text one day. Give the woman some space. "
Jesus just break up with her. She’s better off without you if you’re interested in someone else. She’ll be in a lot more pain later  if you don’t just buck up and end it soon. It’s not fair to her.
"I’m going to take a slightly different view from others here and rather than say he sounds insane, tell you that you two sound incompatible. 

That sucks and it’s okay to grieve this breakup, but ultimately you’ll want to date someone whose values and worldview matches up with yours at least a little more.

Stuff like charms and spells and fortune telling can be like religion to some people. In a way, his loss of the nazar *was* a sign of something not good—you call it a piece of glass and for Steve it’s clearly a matter of deeply held spiritual beliefs. 

This stuff is how he organizes his *entire life*.  Instead of praying for guidance, he read the sign of a charm going missing. Instead of talking to a Priest or Imam or Rabbi or Pastor, he listened to a fortune teller.

It’s super easy to write off superstition and magic-y stuff as nonsense but for some people, again, that’s their faith. 

I hope maybe it might be easier for you to understand how hugely incompatible you and Steve are by thinking of his beliefs as a religion. You probably would’ve realized pretty quickly how not good a match you both were if he’d been praying to God and reading the bible for guidance the whole visit. 

People can be lovely wonderful people mostly and still hugely not right for us. So it is with Steve. I’m sorry you’re hurting but you’ll meet more good men eventually and hopefully the next one will have values that line up with yours more and you can both laugh about the guy who missed on a great catch because a fortune teller told him what to do."
This guy doesn't seem worth the time. If he is rude over something like this just imagine how you would have to walk on egg shells around him and his fragile ego. I am also a man and I appreciate the thought when a woman does this and I have asked dates and friends to do this for me as well. Him being defensive about it shows insecurity. 
My GF and I both have had way more than 100 partners. I consider myself fortunate because she's a damn good sex partner. Hopefully she feels the same about me. 
"I've read a fair few stories about people in open relationships and this isn't how functional ones go.

I'm not just referring to the way you said yes despite your issues with the idea (even though that is *definitely* a major problem) but usually the partner most interested in the idea will make *sure* to reassure and keep close to their primary partner, to take things slow with the new partner in case the original one realizes they're not actually completely okay with it. They won't get annoyed that their original partner feels insecure. They won't cuddle up to a potential new partner well in advance of actually talking with the existing one. 

She... did none of that, and threw herself onto this guy while essentially forgetting about you entirely. 

If she did indeed try to bend over backwards *just* to give you a good final hurrah and not in an attempt to love bomb you into changing your mind, then... okay, sure, it's *possible* she simply fucked up her end of things, realized she did, and wanted to make amends as much as she could. Which is fair enough I guess.

But some missteps can't be fixed. 

If you don't want to be friends, just tell her you appreciate it, but you're still not fully over her and don't think it would be a good idea. Clarify that you don't still hold a *grudge*, and that you know *you're* part of the problem too (the way you just let her have what she wanted without being honest; the way you let that ""only one partner in life"" idea twist your expectations), but you *do* still have some baggage. 

And if it helps at all, the ""one partner"" idea is *ridiculous*. The whole reason people date and break up is because some incompatibilities don't become evident until months or years into a relationship. In any society that doesn't do shit like arranged marriages or whatever (which are *rife* with problems unless you just get *really* lucky) this is 100% normal. "
"&gt; “I’m a man. I can handle myself. It’s not your place to tell me to text you.”

Well I wouldn't date this."

"Dude, this guy is a fucking volcanic geyser of insecurity and red flags! "
"this guys = asshole

i know when a girl tells me that, that she really cares about me, or is now invested in me enough that she wants to make sure I'm safe. 

this guy, yeah if he doesn't know how to react properly to something so kind, it's could only get worse."
“Not really feeling it” is the understatement of the century! This guy is a complete asshole and a grade-A example of toxic masculinity. Do you really want to be with someone who talks to you that way? 
Yeah sorry OP I agree with the others. Major red flag and not worth it!
"Either she's not ready to commit, or she's not ready to commit to you. That alone doesn't make her a demon or a terrible person. I don't think you're wrong for not hating her or putting serious thought to giving her another chance. What you should think about is whether you two are on the same plane at all. She's very young and has a lot of growing up to do, while you may be more ready to calm down and enjoy life with one partner. If she doesn't see the relationship the same way you do (I'm inclined to believe she doesn't since she wanted to fuck other dude) then you're investing in something that is going to have a painful expiration date. And, there's a good chance this won't be or hasn't been the first and only time. If she's going out and getting fucked up with another dude she still wants to sleep with and trying to hide it, this is absolutely a red flag that the relationship isn't solid. Given her age and the breach of trust that happened the relationship may never be solid. You should consider how seriously she takes your relationship as a whole, and if you feel that you could truly forgive or if you'd always wonder if she's hiding things. "
I'm a wordist. I advocate words have meanings. 
Your date is simply insecure. If he keeps displaying insecurities for multiple times then It can be problem for you. I left someone because she was very insecure.

I think he's being weird and like you said the point is to go with your friends to a fun little community sporting event
Big oof
"""Fool me one time, shame on you, fool me twice, can't put the blame on you. Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign, load the chopper, let it rain on you."""
"Nah you’re not over reacting, this guy is a dick. If he’s that rude over your concern on snowy roads imagine what he’s like on a bad day. "
"WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU GIVING SOME RANDO ANYTHING?!?!?!

Cut her off and block her dude, FFS."
I'd do something similar (make a joke) to make it flirty. This guy missed the mark big time.
"Ask him if he’s interested in going out again. If he says he’s busy but makes an effort in helping out plan for another week or day, then he’s probably interested. If he says he’s busy but doesn’t even try, then take that as a sign he’s not that interested. At least you did something than just be sitting there, wondering. "
"I used to hate my ex with the fiery heat of a thousand suns because he was awful to me, strung me along, and made me feel bad about everything having to do with myself. That was several years ago. I feel much better now, to put it mildly. I still think hes a giant piece of shit dressed up like a real person, but that's only when I think of him, which is not often. You may always hold a grudge, but you wont always feel the way you do now. It *will* pass- just go and live your life. 

And who cares if people who dont matter think ill of you?  You dont get points taken away anymore than you get points added if people who dont matter think you're great. There *are* no points. Some people will like you and some wont. You will like some people and dislike others. That's just how it is. 

But do yourself a favor- leave this guy and his people alone. Your romantic attachment is severed. Your friendship is over. You cant get over that shit if you keep messing with him. The only reason he would come around is to fuck with you, but you dont have to let him. If he wants ""closure"" or whatever, tell him it's a myth and he have a better chance finding Anelua Earheart. Then hang up or shut the door and go on about your business. "
"You would probably benefit from some therapy. A trained therapist or psychiatrist would be able to help you sort things out better and untangle if you do have a disorder or if it's your past hangups causing you problems.

Also... breathe. You're 18, hon. You're not *supposed* to have everything figured out by now."
Me and my friends do this all the time. Cuz we care and want to make sure they get home same. If he is so rude and insecure about his manhood that he needs to respond like that then drop his ass.

"I don’t have any experience with that however, if that is how you feel then you need to be open about it. With that being said, you have to mentally prepare yourself for her to either accept what you say or the complete opposite. I’m on the monogamy train, but if you’re thinking about other people, then marriage definitely needs to be something put on hold UNLESS your gf is okay with exploring a little. 

I’m not much help but figured I’d try to be a friend :)"
"I’m not trying to make you panic but things like this usually go from “he has never done this” to “i never thought this would happen to me” real quick.

If he breaks things when he is angry at this step of your relationship it will unfortunately escalate. The thing you do not want the most is to be isolated from friends, family and coworkers. He is doing the standard manipulative/abusive behavior where they make you feel vulnerable and alone and that you’ll only be safe with them even though you don’t feel that way at first. But then if you brush it off and pretend its fine and try to rationalize his behavior THATS when the true abuse starts.

My mom didn’t KNOW how my father was abusive until their wedding night when he hit her for the first time. My father is someone who breaks things when he is mad. It always escalates too far and its always someone else’s fault. He moved my mom out of state and 6 states away from friends and family. I won’t go i to details but my father was also in the army (never saw combat). You are starting to be in a very similar situation."
"Don't apologize. It's not wrong not wanting to interact with trash people, family or not."
"This thread is... Interesting. I do not really eat vegetables. I eat corn, potatoes, breads and meat. My wife is not a fan of red meat and prefers fish and veggies. We both eat pasta. 

Not once in 25 years has this been an issue. We have careers, kids and a life together. No time to worry about the others food preferences! "
"Typical Scorpio, LOL."
"Idk, maybe. It’s kind of odd to think that the average house would have that many spare rooms in it imo, but maybe so."
"Thanks for your honest input. Therapy is indeed planned. As I stated somewhere before, I will only believe our relationship has a future (that I'll ever be able to trust him again) if he has a coping strategy (agreed with me) and shows in actions that he follows it. I am indeed aware that this means a lot of changes are needed and he's the one to do all of this. Question is if cheating and lying are behaviors you can learn (and unlearn). I'm also trying my best to see way past the sunk cost fallacy when discontinuing the relationship (losing him as a person who really fits for me in so many ways, our life together, our marriage, the pets, our future ...). I try to see it as a relationship that should only continue if he proves that strategy is in place."
"It's probably worth looking into with a specialist. 

It such is recognized as an eating disorder you can at least expect to get better and maybe people would be more sympathetic towards the condition. Otherwise it really only comes across as ""weird"" or ""immature""."
No kids means no need to vaccinate them.
And that's all I want for him but what in asking is for any advice as to how we do that together 😅
"He's is still a baby who is still crawling and hasn't learned how to walk. And you keep carrying him so he never gets the opportunity to learn how to walk on his own.

You go into a relationship to give without expecting anything in return. When one has nothing to give anymore the relationship starts to drift apart. If the 2 partners aren't growing together then it's time to move on. You are clearly growing while he has stayed stagnant and from the sounds of it, he isn't doing anything to improve upon himself. "
You have nothing to apologise for. You're a child. Your mother however is a grown woman acting like a child. Honestly reading that your grandmother said she won't take the food away made me cry. Maybe it's a good thing if you stay with them for a little while. I'm sorry your mum is such a self involved asshole. 
"Sugar baby is a little different. They are “oncall”. I am an escort and if my times show I’m not working, I’m not working. However, this is a faux relationship. He could easily call her up and ask her to come over with late notice or for her to stay overnight etc. which messes up plans if you have prior arrangements with a bf. 

I assume this is her only sugar daddy which means she is motivated to keep him happy. My income doesn’t rely on a single person. I can ignore people texting and calling when I’m off work, I’m still going to be able to pay bills despite that. If she ignores her SD and makes him feel unwanted, she could lose him"
"Get an lawyer. Time to move on. 

Sorry bro."
"You cannot MAKE anyone do anything. All you can do (and this is my advice) is to state clearly that you would want her to come with you to the appointments. You can do that in vulnerable way where you say you are scared and would want her to come along. She might say no or find excuses, and then you have to figure out if that's a deal-breaker for you."
...you're 10 days in. Take it slow champ
"&gt; We have been seeing each other exclusively for about a month and a half now

..

&gt; she is currently in a sugar relationship with an older man

So you're *exclusive*, but she's not."
"Honestly the reddest of flags, and I'm surprised no one has mentioned:   
  
&gt;I asked her more questions about the symbolism of flowers, if she thought he liked her and wanted to date her (she said yes)  "
"From the way I'm reading this, he packed and loaded your stuff into his truck while you were at work without your permission (theft) and threatened the life of your pets by putting them in his freezing vehicle so he could kidnap you under duress. This is terrifying! I'd contact your family *and* the police. I'm no lawyer so I can't say if they'll see his actions the same way I do, but there's no way he should get away with this. Call your job and tell them you've got a family emergency so you hopefully don't get fired and find a way to get away from this guy as soon as possible. He's not safe at all. If you've got any written communication showing you did not intend to move for another month, hang onto that as evidence that he kidnapped you."
"This times 1000.

Now, your mom is not likely to apologize, either, but she is wrong here. Very wrong.

What you did by trying to follow the insane rules while preserving your sanity is going to have to be what you do until you can move out.

Spend as much time at your grandparents’ as possible.  Make sure you thank them for being so nice to you."
My advice is she (I don't know your age) is too young for a long distance relationship. You're also weirdly possessive of her and should reevaluate your relationship. 
True. I’ve seen him with some people. He doesn’t have the best memory. Ok thanks for your help and putting up with my incessant questions I appreciate it. 
"Maybe he felt some tension in that moment that he wanted to disrupt, if it's callback humour well that's just normal for friends, partners family pretty much form of relationship will have callback humour in this instance maybe it was even used to remind how long you have known eachother which probably suggests that by and large he has positive feelings about your interactions over the years."
"Is your son older than hers, cuter than hers, has more people commenting about how wonderful your son is? etc etc."
I would too. Food is a big part of life. I want my partner to cook too.
But...can't our girlfriends brush them for us?
Your mom is a horrible person and your life would become better if you somehow managed to minimize her place in it.
"Oh ok that makes sense. I can see that. You’re right callback humor happens all the time. Is there any significance to him bringing up things about myself and my past that I told him a long time ago? He seemed to remember all these details about my life, right down to what my jobs company was called and I only told him once. He literally remembers everything about me and wants to know more. But again. Could just be he has a good memory "
"Not my girlfriend who doesn't use the pill got pregnant, our threesome partner who is on contraception (refer to my other comment for details) got pregnant. 

If nina got pregnant there would not really be much of an issue at hand here ... "
"White male here so probably disregard anything I say but the way you put it seems kind of joke. Not that it wasn't weird - it was, but maybe take things as they go for now. I don't think it was said of ill intent or in a negative sense. He might have just never dated a black girl before, so this might be totally new territory for him. Again, still weird. Worth cutting and running though? Seriously maybe not."
That is an opinion about her. Not your feelings.
"I think you’ve got to take this one step at a time. First just breathe and get grounded. Then find out what Emma wants - does she plan to have the baby? What would that living situation look like? Talk to Nina and make sure you two are communicating. At some point, if she’s having the baby, you’ll have to figure out what you want and how involved you want to be (if at all). You can’t be forced to be involved in the baby’s life, though assuming you are indeed the father, you can be forced to pay child support. You generally can’t give up your parental rights unless someone else is adopting, be that a new couple or a stepparent. 

Also, you should be doing a better job with birth control. Figure this stuff out before the drinking starts. It sounds like you weren’t even aware of Emma’s sexual activity outside of joining the two of you, which means STDs are a possibility, which is a really good reason to use condoms. That and you don’t really know her, so you can’t know how reliable she is with her birth control. The same will be true for any other rando you find for a three way. "
"It's not her job to educate him and she doesn't owe him an explanation. Besides, he doesn't seem like the kind of guy who would respond well to constructive criticism. "
"Well the thing is, she had been doing this for about a week.. we met up and while I repeatedly said i wanted to work it out and loved her, she only had attacks on my character and nasty remarks. We gave it a few more days, she said she wanted to work it out still, but then when we met up and she again had an attitude that didn’t back up the intention of working it out.. and i ended up yelling cuz i couldn’t keep my cool anymore. She texted me breaking up w me a few days later and blamed it all on me. Shortly followed by how she still wants to be friends and then again shortly followed by how she misses and loves me, etc... I didn’t respond for a while cuz I couldn’t believe her.. but when i did we decided to meet up and she said she was sorry cuz she thought she knew what she wanted but she was wrong and cant imagine life w out me.. so were meeting up tomorrow and i was actually planning on telling her how i felt like we had a bad few weeks and she let that define our relationship and me as a person and that i want to move forward but we have to communicate better.

I know this is alot, but, any thoughts are welcomed, its been as tough as anything I’ve ever had to go through. My best buds have told me not to let her play or shes not worth it, but i feel like if she is willing to recognize the 6 months of happiness before these bad last few weeks, then she is worth it. "
Time to move on. Three dates is not enough to worry about. Forget he exists and carry on with your life.
"We don’t know the amount that OP’s girlfriend is trying to stay afloat and alive. She’s exhibiting significant symptoms but who knows how much worse they might be? She could be trying so hard and still struggling. She could have made progress herself. 

We don’t know how much she brings to the relationship, how much joy she brings him, how much she contributes other than financially. 

So many people here see her as nothing more than a nightmare. A nuisance who is draining OP. I’ve been that nightmare. When it’s hard to accept you need help. When you’re on a 2 year waiting list to see a professional. When you can’t see the light and just want to give up and die. 

I’ve also had a boyfriend who accepted my illness. I told him that this is my life, and he is welcome to walk away because I understand how hard it is to be an SO to someone like me and OP’s girlfriend - it’s torturous. But he loved me enough to see me through unbelievably painful rough patches where I could do nothing but stay stagnant just to keep going. 

Mental illness and recovery are not a straight line and it’s not easy. "
"I just wish I could help somehow, but I dont think I can. I honestly think it would just be an insult to her, to have someone care. Maybe I'm wrong, and perhaps Ill try to find the way to phrase it, before my goodbye. Thank you for your words and encouragement."
"Oh hun.

Don't apologise. I would see if your grandparents can arrange some counselling for you. They sound great, stay with them for as long as you can."
Boom. This one. Lotta people here being very unsympathetic
"hah, he said something I don't like, let's condescendingly reply!!1!!"
"Don't apologize. You can't reinforce mom's shitty behavior anymore. She calls you names and carves that shit in your brain and it isn't your fault, it's hers. From now on fight her on the weight issues. Every time she engages, engage right back. Soon the price of trying to manipulate you, to make you feel bad about yourself, will be too much to continue. You are the only person looking after your well being. If mom thinks you need to learn respect, tell her ""You first.""

I'm upset."
"What about your social welfare? Are you married? Do you want to be married and have children? If so, do you understand you'll be doing to your wife and kids what your father has done to you? He's taken away from you to provide for them. Because of this, you'll be taking away from your wife and kids to provide for him."
"To ask her to end her friendship?

Yes thats imo an unreasonable action that is only going to drive a wedge between you.

This is about whats been taken from you and less about what your gf feels"
The problem is they don't understand that the cost of living is so much higher that the miraculous $8.00 per hour isn't close to enough to cover basic living expenses and medical care.
"""He doesn't like to try new things because it stresses him out.""

Has he seen a mental health professional or looked into ARFID, maybe? I only ask because though I'm not diagnosed, I've been exhibiting similar behaviours since childhood and can empathise with the thought of new foods being stressful: I have a limited diet of foods that are ""safe"" to eat and the thought of trying new things, or things with textures/smells/appearances that my brain is for whatever reason repulsed by, also stresses me out and makes me panicky. I will, however, try new things if they're presented to me in a low-stress environment (i.e, ""I'm making/ordering \[x food I don't eat\], do you want to try a piece?"" or ""We're going to a Chinese buffet, want to come?"")  but I absolutely can't if it's presented like a demand (""You don't eat anything! Sit down and eat this thing!"")

It's not your job to nag him; you're his partner, not his mother. Only you can decide if this is a dealbreaker for you. I'd suggest, first and foremost, recommend that he see someone about his issues with food and, with them, come up with a plan to tackle or mitigate it. The onus of making him try things shouldn't be on you. "
"You are welcome to ask, but it most likely will end your relationship. "
Huh I didn’t even think of that. So me not revealing my feelings yet will still keep him as a fwb and he’ll wait and see if anything occurs. (If we’re right in that he might want more) but That makes sense so I still have time to develop this thing. One more question tho...why would he joke about me finding a rich guy to marry and have beautiful babies with”?? his words not mine.
"The way that you described her reaction, denying it at first. When that doesn't work she blames you, when you don't fall for that she blames herself and as a last resort says how sorry she is.


It sounds harsh but you're better off divorcing her. She is not truly remorseful about cheating on you. She's just sorry about being found out. It would be difficult to trust her again and would be worse in the long run for you. You would most likely end up regretting your decision in 15 years.

But hey, your life. If you feel like it is better for your happiness then keep her around. Just remember she chose her own way to happiness when she cheated on you. You do not need to concern yourself with how she will feel if you leave her. Her happiness is not your priority in this decision. Your own happiness is."
"Don't mean to state the obvious, but starving yourself to lose weight will not ever keep it off. Been there. Doesn't work"

"Sounds like an eating disorder or something, perhaps due to not being fed those foods during childhood? There's very little normal about not being able to eat the entirety of foods that are healthy for you.

What about meat? Do you actually like the flavour of meat that has been just steamed or boiled and hasn't got any spices or sauce on it?"
"Came here to write this! 

It sounds like the two of your love languages are off, she may not feel loved from having services provided/the thoughtfulness of your lunch &amp; you don’t feel love because it’s not provided to you. Check out the five love languages and learn how to communicate this to her &amp; in an open line of mature dialogue without fighting at all (not saying you do), get your point across about what you need.

"I would consider this emotionally cheating if my wife did this. If she ever had a crush on another man she better nip it in the bud, not stoke the flames with coffee.. like wtf."
100% this. He needs to be an adult and own his shit.
"You are now isolated and under his control. He will escalate, eventually, it's just a matter of when."
"Since you haven't even met this guy for a date, it's really hard to say. It could be him being dumb and trying to give you a compliment (BADLY, of course) similar to those ""you're not like other girls"" comments that most women hate and most guys have made at one time or another. 

You don't owe him anything, and that includes the benefit of the doubt. You don't have to go on a date and probe him further to find out what he meant by that.  It wouldn't be wrong if you to cancel, if that's what you'd prefer to do. 

I don't think you need to assess his comment for how bad it was so much as you need to assess how much it will bother you. Can you see yourself being bothered by it weeks or months from now, wondering if you should trust him? Or do you think you could forget about the whole thing if you go on one date and it goes really well? It's really up to you and neither makes you wrong. "
"Girls are always kissing other girls when they go out though? I’ve never made anything of it apart from the fact that they are just a bit drunk. And if your girlfriend is like you say undoubtedly “straight” then what is the actual issue here? I think you are overthinking the whole situation, if its any comfort my girlfriend is always kissing her friends whenever we go out in a drinking environment."
Hasn't he done a couple of Buzzfeed videos?
Because you are long distance and being jealous and controlling. This is exactly how you destroy they slim chance of a long distance relationship working.  
Get his hormone levels checked. 
"OP, your mother is being abusive towards you. I know it’s hard to hear that but she is. She is inducing an eating disorder in you. You need to be eating 3 healthy meals a day and if she’s not willing to provide them for you, you should stay with your grandparents. Have you told them the extent of her behavior around food? It sounds like they might have some recognition of how unhealthy it is.

Also, you seriously need to talk to your school counselor about this situation and consider engaging CPS. Your mother literally has a legal obligation to provide you with sufficient food, and she’s not. She is being a terrible terrible mother and under no circumstances does she deserve your apology."
This is so weird.  Has she done anything else that might imply she doesn't want to be seen with you in public or by her other friends?
"Actions speak better that words. Trust your instinct on this.

Your choice on how to break up with him, but you shouldn't ghost IMO."
"Same, I knew a guy who only ate meat pizza. I think even fries have some vitamin C in... crazy"
"It’s not reasonable to ask her to end her friendship especially since they’re so close and you two aren’t even near each other physically, but I can tell you that I’ve been in a place like your girlfriend but I felt like you do. I felt like my “firsts” had been taken away from me by a girl friend that I wanted to do with my first partner. Like cuddling and cheek kisses. She tried to be my first kiss but I turned her down, too many times to count. If your girlfriend doesn’t feel that way there’s not much you can do besides voice that you’re uncomfortable and tell her exactly what you’ve said here about wanting your first kisses to be special. "
"They're not going to have kids, so no need to argue about vaccinations."
"Finally, thank you very much!

Salads literally contain nothing of nutritional value. Fruits contain a lot of fructose, which will give you fatty liver if you eat to much. A lot of people like myself can't handle the fibre beacuse of IBS.

What's considered healthy these days isn't really healthy at all. Eat fresh and don't overeat.

You can obtain everything you need from meat and organ meats."
It also directly affects your own health.
"The current situation has a shelf life, probably not a long one.

I can't really advise you on a course of action as i don't know either of you.

"I had an ex-husband who wouldn't eat anything but meat and carbs, too. Plain cheeseburgers, fries, pizza, soda, and milk was pretty much his diet. He had other issues, too, like being a messy, lazy, whiner, but I digress.

I left him after a total of 9 years together, 6 years married, and two children. You can get free. He's just a boyfriend, not a husband, and 5 years is better than 6.

When I met my husband and we were dating it showed me how bad things really were. I was stunned by how terrible and limited my diet had become due to living with my ex. I felt such relief after ending my first marriage. It changed meal planning, shopping, cooking, and going out on adventures for the better in so many ways."
Sounds like a selfish jerk. 
"I know you feel like you need to apologize because she’s your mother, but you do not need to. She has been withholding food, calling you names, etc. The food you’re eating is not enough, which can actually make it harder to lose weight. If she won’t believe you or won’t let this go, I would push her to get you an appointment with a dietitian. You can ask them questions about healthy eating, portion sizes, and maybe even have them come up with meal plans for you. That way your mom can either have a professional tell her what a moron she is for starving a growing teenager, or at least help you get enough to eat until you are old enough to leave home. "
"All drugs prescribed by doctors have known side effects that affect some people who take them. Some drugs have very severe side effects that can cause psychosis, suicidal ideation, hallucinations etc in a small minority of people. Drugs that are meant to treat mental health issues like depression are the ones that are most likely to have side effects that affect peoples moods. Your friend was clearly having very severe side effects from her pills and needed help and care. And still does. Imagine knowing you did what she did and now being fully aware of how messed up that was and how close she came to dying. And how she's messed up her friendship with you.

I think warning your friends she was having a mental health crisis is fine, but you seem to be taking it as a personal insult to you. It wasn't, and it sounds like she is now no longer suffering it and needs help and sympathy. Asking or expecting they don't ever see her again is appalling. Yes, it was a terrible shock to you, and must be even more awful as it was in your home. It's normal to feel your home has been violated and perhaps even is unsafe because we invest parts of ourselves into our homes, and anything that happens to them feels like it's happening to us. But the poor woman had a huge reaction to some drugs prescribed for a mental health issue, did some things she had no control over, and now you expect all her friends to drop her. So weird.

Calling her med school was a horrible thing to do, and I hope they treat her with the sympathy you haven't shown. I would much rather see a doctor who knows about side effects from drugs first hand, about mental health issues first hand, who understands that our brains can make us do really stupid things, than someone who has no personal experience of these things. I hope she goes on to become the kind caring doctor I sure she can be.

And you need to take your poor daughter to therapy to unpack the feelings and emotions of being told by her own mother someone tried to kill themselves in the house. And you could probably do with done yourself to get over how you're viewing your friend's mental health crisis, and how you're handling things with your daughter. "
"I had this issue with my fiancé! He would not eat any fruits or vegetables, and ate very unhealthily  (fast food etc). I think you need to get to the bottom of why he doesn't eat vegetables. For my fiancé, it was related to adults forcing him to eat vegetables during his childhood, in a very forceful way. 

However, these days he eats most things! I had many talks with him about the health risks of his eating habits, and tried to make him associate fruit and veg with positive things such as energy, health, vitality. Then I would gradually introduce vegetables when cooking for him- at first somewhat ""hidden"" (chopped up, blended etc) so he got used to the flavours, and using the more bland veggies first (e.g. carrot, cauliflower). Then over the course of a couple of years I would introduce more types of fruit and veg and now he eats like a normal person.

However, note that I thoroughly enjoy cooking so it was not a chore, and also he was not whiny about food in general. Your partner needs to have a positive attitude for this to work. Also note that I definitely do not think it is up to you (or that it was up to me in my case) to change your partner. However, if you see yourself with him long term it could still be worth it to make an altruistic effort, also for your own sanity."
"What kind of insecure dude thinks ""text me when you get home safely"" *during a fucking snow storm* is someone pushing them around?"
I'm not sure. LDR above all requires loyalty. And she's already proven she won't stay loyal if her emotions fluctuate. I've been in a similar situation. I would call it off.
"My husband and I do the same - we both just take care of our own food. I have allergies and he is picky, and this works better for us. "
"Dude, I’m 4’11 and weigh 148 pounds and I’m not even chubby. So you being 5’2 and about 130ish isn’t chubby. Fuck your mom and her low self esteem. Your grandparents are awesome. Your mother is truly not right in the need and she needs help. But she’s so narcissistic she won’t get it. Honestly, don’t apologize to her. She was a total cunt rag. *SHE needs to be the one who apologizes. "
"okay, but this 22 year old girl was just a rebound for you then that you were just with to feel not rejected by the one you truly loved. it was not fair for the girl.  

this girl i'm talking about .. yes she's 10 years older than me, but i should mention that when i met her, she was renting an appartment but got kicked out because the owner wanted to have it for air bnb.

she was basically homeless looking for a place, when i offered her to come live with my parents. she lived here for 2 months, and then we found a place which she bought with her savings, and on top of that she got some money from a relative that passed and on top of that she took a huge loan and bought the appartment, i contributed money into it as well, payed rent, i put together all the furniture with my own hands, payed some of them half. 

i was not just some 22 year old there for free. nope. i was mature,responsible and worked my ass off for it. "
"don't apologize. its okay to be you with your problems and your head space.

you just have to accept that your mother probably doesn't know any better. my relationship with my parents was a lot like this but they just didn't know any better, their parents would've just beaten the living shit out of them and demanded respect. they grew up in a different world, be patient accept an apology even if your mother doesn't know what she is apologizing for because it means at least she knows she did something wrong"

"Do NOT apologize! You have done absolutely nothing wrong. Your mother, and sorry to be so blunt, sounds like a narcissist asshole. You should stay as far away from her as possible. She is not normal and needs to see a therapist asap! I hope you can stay with your grandparents cause your dad sounds like an enabler too. I'm sorry. Virtual hug from me an internet stranger."
"I'm afraid this is a long answer because I have had this experience in my life and I know how long-lasting and deep this goes. Snatching food from you, calling you names, is not a petty thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Controlling what people eat or don't eat is abuse, especially if it's done in a humiliating way. (Imagine anyone else in your life doing this to you, a friend, girl/boyfriend, teacher, would you accept it?) You are almost an adult, not only should you be treated with more respect than this, your mother (if she was being a decent mother) should be teaching you how to be an adult right now and preparing you for living independently in this world. That includes things like ordering your own food in a restaurant, being responsible for your own diet and health, and especially teaching you how to assert yourself and determine how you should be treated by others. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, it looks like she's setting you up to accept disrespectful, controlling treatment (by friends, partner, boss etc.) even if she doesn't know it. We normalise what is done to us when we are young. And the way she treated you should not be your normal.

&amp;#x200B;

If she genuinely cared about your health she could be teaching you about nutrition and healthy eating/exercise habits. The only thing you learn about having food snatched from your hands is low self-esteem and an unhealthy relationship with food. 

I had a similar experience with my own mother and it's taken a long time to fix up my heath, so before you fall into bad habits this is my humble advice, 1) never feel guilty about eating when you are hungry, hell don't feel guilty about eating before you get hungry, we are meant to eat regular meals to give us strength to do stuff like study, work, play sport. 2) get some guidance from a professional or learn about good nutrition and find a realistic goal weight/maintenance weight or measurement for yourself. It's actually not that hard to maintain a healthy weight if you keep a general track of what you eat and if you eat healthy/proper meals at regular times. Sure chips and cookies aren't good meal replacements (low nutritional value and not very satisfying) but neither is it ok to only eat a salad when you are starving. Undereating is as dangerous as over-eating. 3) talk to a therapist or multiple until you find the right one to help you make sense of this situation 4) Know your worth and protect yourself from abusive treatment. Your mother has her own demons to work out and she may be trying to work them out through you but that's not your job. It's her job to sort herself out. If you are safer with your grandparents, then stay there."
"Your teeth and future you will thank you. Twice a day, morning and night, no sooner than 45 minutes after eating or drinking anything (other than plain water) as the first 30-45 minutes after eating/drinking is when your enamel is at its weakest and brushing at that point can damage the enamel. Make sure you floss regularly. If you do want to use mouthwash, use it to rinse your mouth out before brushing, not after. Using it after rinses away the helpful fluoride that toothpaste gives you.

BRUSH YOUR TEETH."

"You are in no way obligated to lie for other people and I always tell people that when they ask me not to say anything. I always say ""I'm not lying if I'm asked directly"". I won't go spilling my guts, but I'm not going to lie for anyone. Everyone who knows me, knows that.

Unfortunately, we live in a time where an allegation is taken as being found guilty. False allegations have ruined a lot of men's lives. A Los Angeles County Sherriff's office investigator told me that false sexual assault allegations have become a regular part of divorce proceedings and is almost always a fake allegation. That's too bad. But unfortunately, people just can't take the chance.

They have to make the worst assumptions to protect their own kids. Having said that, it's pretty hard to come up with a realistic set of circumstances where someone could have uploaded kiddy porn to his computer without his knowledge. Not impossible, but improbable.

I'm sorry your friend has put you in this position, but I don't see where you have a choice."
"Definitely, as you can read in my post and the replies he wants to stop, but we need (he needs) support to come up with a strategy that will help him not to do it again. Experiences and advice are welcome (we expect those from counseling too but think the community could help as well). There only was physical action with his ex, the rest was online (still cheating and crossing our agreed boundaries, I'm just clarifying)."
It just felt weird to me. He definitely planted the seed bc now I’m picturing him as a father and how it would be if we were married. But I don’t want to assume. Like you said it could just be curiosity but for as long as I’ve known him he’s never ever talked like this and this much.  I don’t know if he was planting the seed or actually seeing where I stand but it was an odd way to do it and I’m not sure if I passed his test ya know? I do have feelings for him but I don’t know how to tell him 
"Oh honey you almost made ME cry, reading this. I didn’t read your original post but you didn’t embarrass your family. SHE did. You don’t need to apologise. SHE does. Stay where you are, it sounds like it’s the best place for you to be right now. "
"Wait a minute, that’s a weird flex considering he’s mature enough to have a threesome with his wife and maintain a home relationship and I’m sure you got out of life changing mistakes by dumb luck, which this guy seems to have run out of.

Some of us have relationships where we have other women to please our wives. Sometimes sexually, sometimes not. Pretty fucking stupid yes to not plan contraception with the other woman in the three way but the biggest crime I see here is ignorance in love.

You seem hella edgy."

"Hi OP.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm like this. Pretty much everyone I know knows the running joke that I only eat meat and hate vegetables. I'm a 26 year old woman, so while I and everyone thought I'd grow out of this, nope. Still hate them. I have friends who are converted vegetarians who tell me ""Food is so much tastier when you don't rely on meat, let me cook for you!"" and I say okay fine and then I eat their food and they look at me smugly and I'm like no sorry I'm just not into it.

&amp;#x200B;

I try and combat it by eating fruit for breakfast and forcing myself to have some vegetables with dinner, but honestly it is forcing it. I don't understand how people enjoy those foods. Luckily I'm not a big carb eater (my mum is coeliac so I wasn't raised with bread and pasta in the house), so it's not affected my weight. I will try foods, but honestly people expect me to suddenly enjoy vegetables and I just don't.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh side note, I've always DETESTED salads. Like I can eat root veg (not enjoyably, but I will), but salads were always a big deal. Then at the age of 25 we find out that I'm kind of allergic to them. I had no idea, I thought everyone's mouths hurt when they ate celery. So that might be a factor. 

&amp;#x200B;

His unwillingness to try is concerning. I'm stubborn as fuck, and I was definitely of the same mindset at that age. I don't like vegetables, I'm thin and active, so it doesn't matter. But you start getting older and feeling like shit and you realise you need to eat a gross vegetable every now and then.

&amp;#x200B;

This seems like a real dealbreaker for you though. If this is something you can't live with, and something he refuses to change, it's time to face the fact that you're not compatible."
"I believe it is the wife's business to tell the husband, not yours.  But she should not have told you this without telling him first.  Jez."
"I'm just going to keep posting while there are thoughts running through my head. It's possible that I just haven't tried hard enough. Everyone has their natural inclinations, but nearly everyone also has the capacity to learn. I didn't always like going to the gym until I found a training program that worked for me - now, 5 years in, I am still training on a very regular basis, and still enjoying it. If I'd both given up and refused to experiment, I never would have found what worked for me.

I've only had one real relationship, which was long distance combined with weeks together at a time, and then a year living together. I really have not been exposed, on a deep level, to that many people. The cynic in me says that everyone is ultimately the same, but is this true? Maybe there is someone out there just different enough so that I can, with effort, genuinely crave them, and genuinely want them to be part of my life.

He's so insecure he took what you said out of concern as a personal dig against him. Dump him.
"Oral sex is sex too.

Just break up and after that delete him from social media and ignore him. Why would you want to be friends with someone that treats you like that. Why do you allow him to be o treat you like that? "
"After 4 years, it will be really hard for his self-esteem too to hear that. But you will have to do it, you cannot continue to lie.

Also, you should close the chapter with your high school crush, for your own sanity, by whatever mean necessary. It's your choice after all !"

"Agreed. Dump him, but tell him why. Give him the opportunity to learn from it so the next girl might have better treatment. No wonder ghosting is so prevalent when top advice is block and move on after one slip. 

Not defending the dude, but indeed he may not recognize his mistake and just think OP ghosted for no reason."
"Your father's racist attitude may very well come from how he is/was being treated as an immigrant. Perhaps he's had to face prejudice, and sometimes that leads people to retreat within their own (ethnic) group and regard all others as untrustworthy/hostile. I know it's not easy to look at your father and see not only a loving relative who provided for you and your family, but also a person who spouts hateful words about others who've done him no wrong.

That being said, you can reduce contact with him and only discuss bland topics. Call him out (calmly, kindly) on hateful speech. Explain that times are different now and you are sad to see him carry so much hate for individuals who don't deserve it. Encourage him to see other people as individuals, not as their race. And finally, when/if you introduce your GF to your family, shut down any disrespectful comments on the spot. Change won't happen overnight, but you must show yourself as not tolerant of abusive words, even if they come from him.

You haven't mentioned your specific Asian culture, but most are very big on children's respect towards parents, which is why I don't recommend an aggressive verbal confrontation, since your father may disregard you entirely instead of being enticed to talk."

"You're right, I puting my foot down tonight and I'm gonna tell her in an assertive way that if this doesn't stop I have no problems leaving. "
"Vegetables have a crunch in general (stalks, cabbage, lettuce, etc). Yes, there will be some vegetables that aren't crunchy. I don't think most vegetables lose their crunch when they are cooked, only if they are boiled for a long time. I would never eat kimchi raw, but surprisingly I am okay with eating kimchi cooked in soup, because it's much softer then, and also infused with the aromas of the food (i.e. it doesn't have the raw veggie taste). Vegetables tend to still have the ""vegetables"" taste when stir-fried, which is what puts me off. I do, however, fancy a particular vegetable stir-fried with sambal sauce, so I do think it's a lot about the aroma (taste/smell) surrounding the vegetable at the point of consumption for me. 

You have some interesting analogies there! However, I am also as picky with fruits as it comes to vegetables, so I don't eat tomatoes. I absolutely cannot stand eating maize/corn (my #1 would not eat). I'm not a fan of potatoes because they are very starchy, but when done well I appreciate it. I can take mashed potatoes and baked potatoes, but in general ""vegetables"" to me refer to leafy greens that appear more commonly in burgers, noodles, your daily foods (don't get a lot of potatoes in my food here).

I'm not saying that an onion is the exact same thing to me as a carrot, but rather, I dislike different types of vegetables/fruit for different reasons. It could be the crunch or it could be taste, or even the smell (e.g. salads). "
And the fact that he texts her wanting to hang out again with no mention of or apology for the disrespectful comments just goes to show that he doesn’t think it was rude or a big deal.
