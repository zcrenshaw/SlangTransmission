0,"&gt; We're sorry we dug ourselves into this hole...

I would move any team who said this to the front of the line, pizza or no pizza."
1,You use a bat to activate Windows?  Most people use a bat to motivate users.
2,"&gt; $IT is not helpful to me. This must change.

When you try to change your email address, but end up changing your employment status instead."
3,"What gets me is when my boss gets one of these emails he will immediately forward the email to the whole office as a warning to not open this type of email...
 Complete with working phishing links still enacted. 

I don't know how we haven't been compromised. "
4,"I still to this day do not understand why people see ""DELETED"", ""TRASH"", ""RECYCLE BIN"" etc. and think it's for fucking storage. And the sad part is I've run into some of these mouth-breathing morons."
5,User failure. Please replace.
6,"For real, self awareness, in this age? You got it!"
7,[deleted]
8,Golden... but next we will have a story about a guy who can't find Michael's bimbos.
9,"As a student IT helper, we have the same ideas about the recycling piles üòÅ "
10,I was so pissed when she kept fighting it. If you need your fucking emails then don‚Äôt delete them.
11,With most things in 1st line support I find a bat can be very useful.
12,"&gt; We're sorry we dug ourselves into this hole and would greatly appreciate you digging us out.

In my mind, they made it to the front of the line as soon as they said this. The bribery would have just been icing on the cake."
13,"""Hey boss, I opened that link to the security training that you sent to all of us. It didn't work. What's up?"" "
14,"&gt; basement

&gt; Florida

Well *there's* your problem."
15,Sounds like the principal just wanted a new monitor.
16,"Yeah, that really useful folder?  It's mine, my stuff, I maintain it, I created it, I update it.

Hey, now's a good time to talk about my annual performance review..."
17,"Hello stranger  
Well, hello stranger  
Can't you see that your roof is leaking?  
Why don't you fix it?  
Well, right now it's rainin' too hard  
And when the suns a shinin  
why, it dont leak!  "
18,"I'm sorry for your workplace. :(

My workplace orders from one of 3 local pizzerias that are well known for delicious pizzas. I've only been disappointed with one workplace pizza event. That coordinator was quickly reminded of her failure to order from one of the 3 approved places by her VP. "
19,"&gt; ""I want a different email address. No? Well, then my email doesn't work!""

""What a coincidence. Now, neither do you."
20,"I find myself often saying, ""Yeah, you'd think..."".

Now after writing this I've noticed a second more accurate meaning... ""you think""."
21,"The apology and self awareness got them to the front of the line. 

Budget approval got them expedited testing. 

Pizza got them same day PROD push. 

Each piece was very vital to their end result :P"
22,"The hard part is not necessarily doing it, but rather figuring stuff out. It's funny how a lot of people don't get that..."
23,"¬π The bad rabbit joke?

Q: What did the male rabbit say to the female rabbit?  
A: ""Sex won't take long, did it?"""
24,"Well, maybe he'll have a new email address at his next employer."
25,"I really expected OP to say, ""JUST KIDDING! They still blamed IT though there is proof, in writing, that they are the ones who F'd up."" I can't believe they would not only accept responsibility, but also provide pizza. Do places like this really exist?!"
26,"Got a thinkpad out of that ""pile"" last year too"
27,"I had a user that just could not grasp the concept that a deleted items folder is not for saving things.  Finally I asked her "" Do you keep the garbage can in your Kitchen full and never change it just in case you need some of it again?   she looked at me and said ""I get it now"""
28,"$1 for chalk, $999 for knowing where to make an X with it."
29,"Something like that actually happened at a place where I used to work, and to top it off the person in question sent the reply to everyone in the CC list, proudly stating that the ""security patch"" was downloaded and installed on his system :)"
30,"You can't say that. That's not polite - what if the user hears it?

Instead be more discrete by calling it a [Layer 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_8) issue. It sounds more professional, and I doubt any normal user would take some time to look up what a ""layer 8 issue"" is."
31,You need to be more prepared than that. Carry a thousand foot spool of cable so you can crimp on demand.
32,"Seems as though she would have just as much luck getting her computer replaced by dialing a local fast food restaurant, as she would trying to get it from your company. You have to wonder what is going through the users' minds sometimes."
33,I‚Äôve never seen a basement in Florida. Even Disney World built their ‚Äúunderground‚Äù passages above ground and then built ‚Äúground level‚Äù on top of that. 
34,"Some day in the future I‚Äôm picturing a ticket ranking system: urgent need, risk of damage, trying to work with us, refuses to try something they should be able to handle, abusive/entitled, etc. 

As a sane user, I don‚Äôt want a ticket for something like this to delay IT from responding to my issues that are preventing me from working."
