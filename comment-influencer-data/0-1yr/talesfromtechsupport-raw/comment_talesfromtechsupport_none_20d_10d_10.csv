0,This makes me feel good.
1,"My guess is that her iPad was ""slow"" because whatever software she was using for her work wasn't approved for ipad.

We get that complaint all the time about our software, and our reply is to go ask your supervisor for an upgrade to a Macbook pro or a real desktop because an iPad is a toy for video consumption, not a tool for serious business work.  (It has a stripped down webkit that makes our UI framework go a little loopy. We're in the process of upgrading to the new version that supposedly has better iPad support, but I think we might wait a while before we give our clients the green light on them....)"
2,"&gt; He wanted SO, SO badly to have all the corporate staff use nothing but an iPad as well

Why?? What was his fixation with making everyone switch to ipads? Just because shiny new?"
3,"Don't forget to include the: ""It looks like there was some confusion in my previous email. Let me clarify, ..."""
4,"{sigh}

not even a ""thank you""

And will probably leave a scathing survey about how you were too lazy to come and unplug/plug the printer yourself and they had to do ""all the work"" for you."
5,"I've been repairing printers since 2004 (Laserjet 3 ftw!).

They are the most temperamental, illogical, and fussy items of tech I deal with.

In our team, they are hated more than wireless network connectivity, more than installing some updates, and not others, and way more than Office/Outlook/Email/password issues.

The fact that users seem to completely and wholly rely on them for their complete existence, even though its 2019 and cloud storage is a thing, is just the cherry of the infuriating cake that is printer faults."
6,Manglement get funny ideas and fire the people who question them.
7,"A little while ago I got an email from a guy worded in the most pleasant, apologetic, polite way, asking if he was permitted to have a second monitor. He currently had 1 22"" piece of junk with 1680x1050 res. Company standard is two 23.8"" 1080p screens.

I saw that email, literally stopped what I was doing and walked my ass up there with a brand new monitor and cables. That's the first time I've put other tickets on old because someone was just a nice person.

The guy was so suprised when I showed up and he thanked me 3 times that day. It was awesome."
8,Percussive maintenance. You can borrow my warranty calibration tool. Some folks call it a rubber mallet.
9,"I at one point had a boss that actually let me do this to an extent, had a teacher (worked for a school) start bitching and moaning that I was taking to long and that the issue should be easy to fix. The second I head the user say it should be easy and simple I just got up looked them in the eyes and said ""Due to the fact that you seem to have the issue solution yourself I will be closing your ticket, if you continue having issues please create a new ticket and we will get to it in the order it was received"" that teacher ended up waiting an additional 5 days to get her issue resolved (Boss set her ticket to lowest priority after hearing my story, and then personally went to fix it and then simply told the her that if she ever berated his staff ever again she would only receive support when she was not in the building)"
10,"If it breaks again, I would just take the printer and tell her that unfortunately, it's out of warranty and Dell isn't going to replace it/or the parts, so she just has to use the shared one. Problem solved!"
11,"Also, people notice when someone is nice to a person's face, then nasty about them when they leave the room. People wonder what she says about *them* when *they're* not around."
12,"Because she's an entitled little shit, that's why.  I'd personally put in a complaint that she is using a personal printer instead of the shared and company approved network printer and as such is a breach of security protocol and a possible attack vector on the network."
13,She most likely couldn’t be bothered to leave a survey.
14,Damn you're right. FUCK THE SWITCH STATEMENT :p
15,"I believe the technical term for this user is ""unicorn""."
16,Please tell me that the time is exactly what the issue ended up being.
17,"He's a big-time Apple fanboy, for starters, but the main reason was ""I can do my whole job from an iPad and I'm busier than anyone here.""

Both those things are 100% true, but he didn't realize that all those spreadsheets and construction plans and marketing campaigns and stuff that he *looks at* on his iPad were *created* by someone sitting at a computer.

I'm the Director of I.T. so it was understood from the get-go that I would get to keep all my computers, but a ton of sales staff and on-site personnel were forced to use iPads exclusively for a long time. The on-site personnel still only have iPads."
18,"For anyone interested.   This family is known for screwing over small companies who cant afford (socially) to sue. 

They are an old family in a small town who employ about 60-100ppl depending on the time of year and bring in alot of money.

They do this to vendors all the time.  We just stood up to thier bs after getting screwed.  And nothing bad happened. 

Apparently they pay thier employees well, and on time.  I asked...."
19,I’m telling ya I swear ink cartridges are distributed by organized crime
20,"My favorite floppy disk job was with a 5-1/4. 

User logs service call, unable to install software.

Get to user, 'Yeah, it won't read disk 2, disk 1 installs fine'. Hmm, Ok, maybe disk 2 is pooched. Get them to kick off the installation. 

'Insert Disk 2' - user opens door and struggles to shove the 2nd disk in without removing the first. I stop him and ask why, his response still sticks with me 30 years later.

'It says nothing about removing Disk 1!!'"
21,"c/s personal printer isn't working  
Solved: Wasn't supposed to have a personal printer; problem resolved by removing said printer"
22,"We literally did the exact same thing in our workspace. We moved to network printing, but users could continue use a personal printer that they had with the expectation of once it's unusable (due to toner or otherwise), we're not replacing it, so they should go ahead and get used to the new stuff while they can.

Well, one user is very...... pushy. Didn't want to move to the network printing, liked her old printer, demanded we continue to support it. Our IT Manager, with the blessing of the higher ups, said to her, ""this is clearly still causing issues for you (she was sending in constant tickets about it), so we're going to go ahead and remove it and use the printers that we'll be supporting from now on.""

She tried to go around to the higher ups, but they were very ""not my problem"" about it.

Still a problem user though. But at least she can print."
23,Other than the salary page nobody reads onboarding material
24,"I don’t disagree with you at all, however since it’s not networked they could brush it off as not a threat. Hit them where they care, “ the expense associated with her having a single user use printer isn’t justified. She’s eating into the budget with expensive ink cartridges and supplies that are waste and abuse of the budget.”"
25,"Well then let's hope that /u/Geroxus gets one of the other 6,999 people who're equally awesome! (7 bill / 1 mill = 7,000 - 1 = 6,999)

Those aren't great odds, but it could happen, right?"
26,"My ideal ending after hearing her talk shit behind your back would be ""this equipment isn't actually inventoried in our it system for this location. I spoke to my supervisor and he pointed that out. All untagged hardware needs to be returned and you can file a requisition to get it back out here, sorry."""
27,"If I didnt know any better, I'd say that printer needs a manual update. Better head down, collect it and then promptly forget about ever seeing it, after it carries itself to some dark forgotten corner."
28,This is the kind of case when I wish I was an IT manager just so I could tear that bitch a new one for being fucking disrespectful.
29,"At school, I serve as the ""IT before the IT"" for all the teachers who have me because they know I've even fixed monitors that have broken in half before. But when there's a kid I don't like, ""That's strange"" ""I'm not sure what's happening?"" ""Wait why is it doing that?"" ""Hmm... I don't think I know what's going on here."" Even if the wifi is just turned off."
30,"Our staff at locations across the country used to run things on a couple of MacBook Airs and an iPad for showing photos to clients during tours. The President/CEO/Founder got real excited about the mobile app and the second it launched he yanked all the laptops from every location so they're all running on nothing but iPads. He wanted SO, SO badly to have all the corporate staff use nothing but an iPad as well, but everyone told him straight up ""I cannot do my job on just an iPad.""

On the plus side, I've gotten really good at repairing iPad screens lately because people break them almost constantly."
31,"I'm pretty sure BM is supposed to be Boss Man, but I can't help but read it as Bowel Movement every time I see it. (To be fair, though, the BM in work stories tend to be human excrement, so it usually fits either way.)"
32,"I would recommend not apologizing for things that aren't your fault. I recommend this to everyone, bit especially women in the workplace, because it's a common bad habit.

In this case, I would say, ""Thanks for your patience as we figured this out"" Saying thanks for your patience encourages virtue, apologizing invites blame."
33,That why IT policies need to be issued and signed either immediately after issuance or during on-boarding.
34,"Your story reminded me of one of my past experiences that I thought might be fun to relate.    Anyone that's worked IT in a university can appreciate it I think.

I was in college in the mid-90s.   I started out doing helpdesk type stuff in the lab there, which was usually okay but could be very annoying.  Most of the time the students were fine.   But there were a few faculty that were just nightmares.   Most of them worked in the humanities for some reason, and they really thought highly of themselves.   One of these guys really lost it on me one day because I had issues fixing an HP printer he had.    I eventually fixed it, but mostly I just learned to hate entire departments as part of that job.

By the end of my first year doing helpdesk stuff, I was hired to work on a research project.   The project gave a grant to the school for us to build a multimedia lab (which was a big deal in the mid-90s....the technology was just becoming widely available).   The grant required that we only allow access for science departments though, until the grant ended.  You either had to be faculty in a science department or taking a class to gain access to the lab.   It was really an awesome job.

Anyone who has worked at a university knows that people who think they're important within the organization also don't care about boundaries.  So I had several people from the humanities departments and business school show up at the door to the lab wanting me to fix their PCs, or demanding to take equipment for their classroom.   They would also do it at times I was the only person there to try and guilt or bully me into compliance.

It felt good to spend the next 3 years telling them ""you can't come in here"" and ""I can't help you"" over and over again.   On a couple of occasions, to try and get access to our scanners and printers, a couple of professors had students lie about working on a science project so that I would let them into the lab.    Once I figured out who they really were, I would wait until they were almost done then get security to escort them from the lab."
35,I was just about to say that it was mentioned she was not supposed to have a printer.  I would of collected it up and set her up on the network printer.
36,"Printing is one of the biggest IT magics there is.  The manager of a department had it in for me, and would sandbag every attempt to resolve her requests.  

Out of toner?  We should get a new printer.

Paper jam?  You didn't fix it right the last time.

Swing plate fail after 300k prints and making a WHUMP WHUMP WHUMP?  Don't put in a ticket and cry when it fails fully.

Send a test print to a different printer to see if it's the printer or not?  Blame me for the printer that had a busted fuser right next to it.

Probably the only person out of the 3k I supported I couldn't stand."
37,"Don't forget she is filling out support tickets and monopolized a techs time for the better part of three days to support a printer she shouldn't have in the first place while there is a perfectly serviceable network printer outside her office.

Also is undermining confidence in IT by being a bitch."
38,"This.

No payment after years? We stop service after about three months... And we require getting paid up *at least* to current, if not in advance after that."
39,"Printer ink is made from virgin tears, bald eagle feathers, and crushed emerald powder."
40,"I used GCC for a while but MSVC has far superior optimization imo. We're still C/C++ coders, let's not let little things come between us :)"
41,"Printers do not abide by the laws of man or machine! 

:D"
42,"I'll be honest, when I read that, for a second I thought it might be a software virus that caused the floppy drive to start playing music with the motor noises.

I can't find In The Air Tonight, but several people have done [Africa by Toto](https://youtu.be/Us4asi-_3bw) which is kinda close."
43,"only helps if they are aware of the policy and willfull ignorace is pretty common.

i've worked at companies before that clearly state in the handbook that ""local laptop data is not protected against loss by IT and it is your responsibility to protect critical business data either in one of the IT provided locations (cloud or server) or thorugh  a secure backup process of your own"" i keep the chapter and verse of that policy on a sticy note on my desktop just so i can roll it out when someone starts blaming me for losing their data."
44,"On my previous laptop, USB ports on the left side of the laptop were directly opposite to the ethernet port (while USB ports on the right side of the laptop were further down the edge). As a result of that, USBs went into ethernet port all the time."
