1,"I'm guessing this is accidental/old user who has decided that the delete moves them to the trash bin, so by naming them trash bin it'll do what she wants.  That said, it could be a clever attempt to help people avoid their bills.  Either way, they are minimum need to investigate and re-train the user!"
2,You're going to go far thinking like that. Well done. You'll be jaded and full of hate like the rest of us soon enough.
3,"Poor IT people seemed to be locked into the

""Computers broken, what do we pay you for""
""Computers working, what do we pay you for"""
4,No and no. Thank you for playing. üòÅ
5,"Some logitech mice actually do it (I have the triathlon, it can copy and paste between computers. But i think it's just text, not files "
6,Get a Yubi key or the like.
7,"Yeah, a fair number of antivirii offer the snooze option. It's great if you're working with software that tends to get falsely flagged as malicious. I know AutoHotKey is one such program."
8,"If a password-manager won't work, I'd have her write it down, put the paper in a sealed envelope with markings all over it that can't be easily be duplicated (e.g. doodle all over it) and then lock that in a safe when it is needed.

And of course after it is needed , change the passwords and make a new envelope. Should only be about what, three times a day?

Fortunatly, it is only a temporary problem. Once quantum computers are commonplace, passwords won't be sufficient anyway."
9,"No, this is every three MONTHS. She is so useless at computer stuff it drives me a bit crazy. All she needs to do is remember the new password, the security questions don‚Äôt change unless you DON‚ÄôT REMEMBER YOUR PASSWORD. Scream, swear, rant, thank god I have wine..."
10,"Reminds me of my old PowerBook 1400c, and how its RAM upgrades were literally stacked up, each one plugging into the one below. "
11,My first thought was that the user had the lights turn off :P
12,"Sir I am disabled and have no fingers, your software is discriminatory, I will see you in court!"
13,"Eh, I think I can afford being hateful if that comes with experience and knowledge."
14,nice
15,"I might be the only person in the history of the world who has ever marked an email ""low importance"" and I do it as a passive-aggressive way of telling people that the thing I am replying to is not, in fact, high importance. "
16,For some reason I heard the law and order 'bom bom' after the 'this is one of there stories' haha
17,Some users are too closed minded. They sometimes need a lid opened for them to see.
18,"Read an old one recently where the $Bossman wanted OP to get Google's number so $Bossman could call and threaten Google to take them down from being listed as a bad website.  Yeah, didnt work out."
19,"This happens to me far too often. I get emails with the site lead (not my boss or related to my employment, but the highest on the chain at location and does ""manage"" me) cc'ed because the user is too busy to make a ticket (but can go to my area to bitch, make calls, and write an email). I usually just whip out my passive aggressive dictionary, hit reply all, and proceed to explain the issue, resolution (or lack thereof), and why we can't conform to their wanted resolution.


Then they go over my head, talk to the site lead and get a half-assed resolution that creates more problems. Which has them rinse and repeat the process from the top."
20,"Your inability/refusal to understand how computers work does NOT equate to my needing to create something out of thin air in order to further enable your laziness. It's 2019 and it is both high time, as well as a a prerequisite of your job, to learn how to use said computer. If you are unable to do so, or continue to refuse to see the need for such action on your part, I will gladly take your case to HR and have them either show you the error of your ways, or the door. Your choice."
21,"Lol yeah, after going there 5ish timrd the hopsital said i didn't have to bother visiting unless It goes on for long or i don't trust it. "
22,"Simiakr. We had 1 client that was very regularly upset. We weren't blameless, some of the things our staff had done were down right boneheaded stupid. Lots of little things, not a huge blowup. 

Somehow one of our managers managed to get tickets from their email domain auto set to urgent. 

Went on for weeks, and only made things worse, as they got to expecting every little thing treated like royalty. Urgent queue now so full it was hard to see real urgent matters. 

Took a lot of arguing to get that rule removed. "
23,"&gt;he has continued to disregard

Return that favor"
24,"&gt;Place your finger on the key that is labeled with ""Enter"" or ""Return"", press down, and then release.

""Place your finger on the key that is labeled with the word ""Enter"" embossed on it, or on the key labeled with the word ""Return"" embossed on it. Then, press down on the aforementioned key. Now, release the aforementioned key. """
25,Smart or highly trained in a specific field? 
26,"Actually, you could do it by software alone. If you just have a small program that checks the clipboard and sync it with two computers. And then when pasted, you need to grab it via network. That's actually very possible. Guess I might have a go at it if I find the time. "
27,"Reminds me of my ex-gf's friend's mom... She'd call her mom and be like ""I need to speak with $name, it's an emergency"" except it was never an emergency. So after the 3rd or 4th ""emergency"" that was like, asking if she'd remembered to do the laundry before she left, it was no longer treated like an emergency... Until it actually was, and she got all mad that my friend's mom didn't rush her to the phone, she was like well if every time you called wasn't an ""emergency"" I would have believed you :-P "
28,"&gt;$UML : See my computers are both broken. Your job is to make sure our computers work 24/7 and mine isnt working which means you are not doing your job.

Ah yes.. the ol' something isnt working what do we even pay you for... Always a delightful classic..."
29,When they do that it usually turns into a shit storm on my part by calling them out on it in nasty fashion.  Homie don't play that.
30,IT got posted again. https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/am4dk2/security_breach/
31,"""But the dudes! The dudes! can you block the dudes?""

""No! The dudes abide!""

32,"I googled ""mouse with storage"", and amongst the results for ""mouse storage"" (storage trays or compartments for mice), I actually did come across a product or two. [example](https://www.walmart.com/ip/ations-Safe-Mouse-with-Integrated-4GB-Encrypted-Storage-Real-time-backup-requires-no-PC-installation-Use-on-Any-PC-By-Black-Box-Innov/472958017?wmlspartner=wlpa&amp;selectedSellerId=12921&amp;adid=22222222222125762531&amp;wmlspartner=wmtlabs&amp;wl0=e&amp;wl1=o&amp;wl2=c&amp;wl3=74354554897589&amp;wl4=pla-4577954120534344&amp;wl5=&amp;wl6=&amp;wl7=&amp;%20wl10=Walmart&amp;wl12=472958017_10000013342&amp;wl14=mouse%20with%20storage&amp;veh=sem&amp;msclkid=860edec8da85101d230e829c7470591a)

Don't know about copy/paste automatically storing there, but maybe there's a utility that could do the job?"
33,"I have something of the opposite problem. People will put in a high/urgent ticket that would take 15 minutes or less to complete, but don't respond for 6 hours. Why put in a high priority ticket at 7:30am if you're not going to be available until 2pm? That goes for all tickets, really, but it's more annoying for the ones they think are priority. "
34,Doctors also don't wax floors üòÇ
35,"Unfortunately, they do in fact do exactly this."
36,Maybe. But I really don't think this user was intelligent enough to know how to socially engineer anything. 
37,HA I had never seen that.. good ol Homer
38,"""Yes, the packets flow much more easily if the cables are neatly organized""."
39,Penetration testing?
40,Hahaha. That's amazing. Thanks for updating me. :D

44,"Logictech has mice and software that allows copy/paste between computers exactly the way this lady was expecting: https://support.logitech.com/en_us/article/logitechflow-help

Perhaps she was not as crazy as you think? "
