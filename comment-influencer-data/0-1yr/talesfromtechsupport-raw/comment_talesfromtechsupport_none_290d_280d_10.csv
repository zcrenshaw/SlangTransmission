0,"\&gt;  I guess he just wanted to have control over the network.

Hmmmm."
1,"Congratulations! You found the unicorn!

She follow your (implied) recommendations AND followed instructions to successfully set it all up."
2,"That's what I was thinking, probably setup some form of traffic control, so that his mothers PC was limited on MB/KB sec."
3,Or he didn't want his mom to set up WiFi restrictions for him 
4,They *know* they fucked up. 
5,...I kinda regret reading this on a Monday morning. 
6,"Good for apple I guess that so many people just call any sort of tablet-like device an iPad. 

Edit: Though I'm not a fan of Apple, TIL it's actually a pretty bad thing! Makes sense. "
7,"Always nice when folks admit they made a mistake.
Usually makes the rest of the troubleshooting less stressful."

9,I had an outgoing telecom person change the entire desk over to the optional recording. It costs the same so it generated no reports and very few know about it and do not abuse it. 
10,"I'm surprised they're allowed to tell you their password, at all the places I've worked where we did PW resets, if the user mentioned their password out loud, we had to immediately tell them to change it again lol"
11,"Ah, the classic ""I don't trust anything you say unless I hear it from a supervisor.""

Should ask him if you can just do a voice impression next time and convince the user they're talking to someone else, then repeat exactly the same instructions."
12,"That *""I don't know where how this got added""* was brilliantly slammed there by support."
13,"I love the look some users give that are like a puppy that knows they did something wrong. Honestly I won't get made at someone who admits they are wrong or messed up. The things that always get me are people who blame their fuck ups on you. ""Well it's your fault I didn't back up 6 months of valuable data and it's especially your fault my kids used my work laptop as a frisbee. I want to speak to your manager!"""
14,"But what did you do with the gold chip?

Ninja edit: \*checks flair* I KNEW IT!"
15,In what kind of helpdesk do you work where you can turn off recording at will?
16,"All of my love for that line of yours: (the moon is delicious and my boots are too tight?)

That punchline was excellent. Your sense of comedic timing was perfect. Go you!"
17,"Let's be real here, it isn't his mothers emails that stop Fallout 76 from working."
18,"And now that I'm home and sipping on a glass of bourbon, I see that I was looped into an email chain along with about 754 other people. Fucking reply all. That feature needs to be banished straight to software hell.

In a development that should shock no one with any common sense, once this customer located someone who could actually access the administrative functions in their production environment, they discovered that another person had made a change to one of the settings that I asked to be reviewed. They reverted the change and HOLY CRAP IT WORKS AGAIN! lol

The good news is that I now have a possible person who can be our champion, the name of another person who can make administrative changes in production, and a glass of Buffalo Trace Single Barrel. Life isn't too bad after all. üòÅü•É"
19,"Like every games console is the Nintendo, or every vacuum cleaner for a long time was a hoover"
20,"Customer: ""THE DAMN THING ISN'T WORKING"" 

OP: ""Hey, I understand. Would you like a beer?"" 

Customer: ""That's what I'm TRYING to DO!"" "
21,"Whoever named that distribution group needs slapped.

Hard.

Without Mercy.

"
22,It's monday? Wait...FUCK
23,"This. 1000x.

If a user will just call me at the first sign of trouble and be honest, I'll bend over backwards to make sure they're taken care of properly. Even if they get a few steps in, if they're at least somewhat nice, I'll do everything in my power to make sure they're taken care of.

If they lie and I have to find crap out through detective work and logs, or if they try to flip it so ""it's your fault, not mine!"" [I'll pull out all the stops to prove their fault and make sure they're written up or dealt with.](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7gq45e/stop_unplugging_things_at_random_and_blaming_it/)"
24,"&gt; Nu: I don't like you recording phone calls

translation into non-teethgrit:

Nu: I don't like that you made me look like the fscking idiot that I actually am."
25,"&gt; a shitshow of a meeting that lasted close to an hour and a half

&gt;I finally put a stop to the meeting

Why, oh why, did you let it drag on for that long? After the first 15 minutes it would have been clear enough that they either A) didn't have anyone available to do it, or B) couldn't be arsed to find someone to do it.

Please tell me you at least charged them through the nose for that absurd meeting..."
26,"I was surprised about this as well when I first started working here, especially considering I work for a government entity. lol"
27,"""The wifi isnt working!!""
""Sir, wifi hasnt even been invited yet"""
28,"What grown-ass adult spends their time just sitting and watching an animated dancing baby while *clapping along like a three year old child*

the fuck?"
29,"""But my collegue had it on his Macbook"" do it on my outlook "
30,"A little backstory. Before I was hired, MSP were the sysadmins. When the company first launched their SaaS offering, they hired MSP to manage servers and our customer implementations team installed our software on the server.

I was hired because the MSP kept screwing up our servers. So I'm our sysadmin, and I manage servers outside the MSP for our implementations team. Unfortunately, we still have a large presence w/ MSP, and the contract says they're still in charge of managing the servers.

&gt; Also maybe a quick script that emails you when that server goes down might be useful?

We do have these monitored by Nagios, but I usually ignore alerts unless I'm on production support (which I wasn't that week). $SupportTech does get all the alerts and he was trying to make me aware of them, in a somewhat timid manner."
31,"Oh they are gonna get a bill.

What I can say without divulging too much detail is, the people who actually use our product to do their jobs speak highly of us and pay us a lot of money. That's the good part. The bad part is that their IT department, whose people are individually smart and on the whole nice, as a group behave like a bunch of drunken cowboys.

Working with these guys is like dating a beautiful woman who is juuuust on the correct side of Barney Stinson's Hot/Crazy scale.

We are making an effort to boost the good/Hot part while corralling the bad/Crazy part, which is one reason I took the ticket off of the support team's hands. We are trying to find a technology person on their end who can give us a hand in quelling the noise. I think that we may have identified such a candidate during this circus of a meeting, but only time will tell.
"
32,"Wow, a user that actually said thank you and bought a decent product. Nice."
33,"""No, sorry, that's the payment slot. You need to put a dollar bill in there, and then you can put the CD in here.""

*come back in a week, collect the dollar bills, PROFIT!*"
34,"&gt;so they are defiantly still in the inbox

Not what you meant, but I think it fits quite well. Bloody defiant emails, resisting any attempt to view them :-)
"
35,How do you know if someone's speaking Italian or not when you can't see their hands moving?
36,"Indeed! Most of our clientele is usually really well mannered, which helps."
37,Because playing Fallout 76 is more important than mom's emails
38,"Worked at a company where the Record was 7 ""transfers"" Best I ever got is four. "
