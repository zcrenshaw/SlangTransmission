0,"Of course, the best part of this is that they'll be trusting the the cloud server to properly sync all the files to the junk computer. The same server they don't trust to run."
1,"""Why the f-""

""Oh hey it broke one line later. Progress!""

""Know what, fuck it, output flags every damn step."" "
2,Maybe we should get /u/touchmyfuckingcoffee in here too.
3,*Spanning Tree*? We don't need no stinkin' Spanning Tree.
4,That you're shit at commenting?
5,"OMG what's wrong with you? Just push the ""port forwarding"" button."
6,"One of my passwords is based of my Dock at the bottom. That way, i can never forget."
7,"Yes, I'm a Mac user."
8,"I've had waaaaay to many arguments about the Number ""Oh"" and the letter Zero with users.

Doctors included.


One doctor asked what an exclamation mark was, FML"
9,Sounds like it was a gas!
10,"&gt; Second, the user may poke a hole in the battery when they try to remove it

Yes, that might actually be a risk worth to consider: ""Look, you said I should remove it. But it was stuck, and as you said it was urgent, I used the screwdriver to help popping it out, and then everything went hot first and dark immediately after! It is all *YOUR* fault!"""
11,"My reaction to have a ballooned laptop dumped on my hands is somewhere around Wile E. Coyote's when he realizes he has a lit stick of dynamite on his hands. I've seen couple of laptops catch fire in my career and I prefer it won't happen when the device is on my lap.

I very carefully put it on a non-flammable surface to either remove the battery or storage devices so the rest can be sent to professionals handling the battery recycling."
12,"It’s self oxidising, meaning it has its own source of oxygen in the fuel. Smothering it with something that absolutely won’t burn may help prevent injury or spread but it won’t extinguish the fire."
13,"When I did my fire training at work they said it was a class C fire, not a class D. A class D fire would be for solid metals like magnesium, lithium etc but for lipo/lithium ion fires, they were class C.

Quick cursory Google brings this up:

14,"I’ve has one of those meetings two years ago... get my mid-year review, get told by my boss that there was a complaint to HR that I had been rude to an employee while helping them. 
My first reaction is that it might be possible, but to improve I need to know at least what I did... but our company is so idiotic that HR can not disclose, even to my own boss, what/who/when... and my boss has no choice but to do what HR says...

So my boss had to help me improve something that he didn’t know, and I had to improve on something I had no clue about..."
15,That makes more sense now.
16,"At my old place, my boss had a walk-around phone, we all had desk phones.

One day he hands me his phone rather than transfer the call and I notice the battery has swollen so much the back panel has popped off and partially broken.

Eventually the phone stopped working at all. When I left the company, it was still sat on his desk. In the charging cradle.

I'm still waiting for one of my old colleagues to email and say the building burned down."
17,"The charge level doesn't make a difference in the type of fire though, just the severity, no?

A lithium-ion battery doesn't contain metallic lithium so isn't a class D fire. A dry powder fire extinguisher will work for lithium-ion fires, as well as metallic lithium fires as they're made for Class ABCD fires. 

They're just... incredibly messy so aren't the first choice for other classes generally
"
18,"I have to admit, and I'll never tell you why ...

I once submitted an IT request that essentially said ""The item was destroyed.  It died in my care.  I accept responsibility for the item's destruction. That's all I will say about it.  Let me know what I have to pay to replace the item."""
19,You can run 'telnet [towel.blikenlights.nl](https://towel.blikenlights.nl) 666' to get some sweet impromptu excuses
20,Too much of a cliff hanger. I need to know what's broken!
21,I'm reading backwards and the more I read the more I'm convinced Marketing Boss has a thing for the IT manager.
22,I understood that reference
23,"Recently fixed up my dad's old macbook pro. He came to me and said ""hey the bottom of my laptop is bulging out 
(On an aluminium unibody case,) the battery has been dead for months but i don't want the case damaged"". 
I was in absolute shock as well.

Also please tell me your username is a reference to the band tracedawn! "
24,"If you are very lucky and have a grit bin near your work you can get a fuck load of both sand and salt pretty quickly. 

That has saved half my office because copper extinguishers are ""too expensive to justify"""
25,"Alright, wasn’t sure if you were agreeing, or if you had read it wrong and thought I said that water would be good, haha."
26,"Once I had a college colleague kill a monitor - wires got tangled and screen met floor. He took full responsibility and would even pay out of his pocket right there. Professor was there to explain how things work - it's public college, trying to offer cash like that could be considered a bribe attempt if he turned himself in to some more retentive public servant. An investigation must be conducted, as well as strict terms for replacement of public property.

Things go back and forth for over a month, investigation is concluded, and he's declared... not guilty. Also the monitor got replaced by vendor somehow at no discernible cost. Huh. (Rumor was that IT sent it with the ""DoA replacement request pile"" since it wasn't visibly dented or broken)."
27,"We still have the grit bin outside. So it's still not a justifiable expense. 

My quick thinking doomed me. "
28,The item dumbo.
29,I think you missed a letter there. NXDOMAIN.
30,"Ugh, that is just scary.

Sadly it is not. It is a play on words on a nickname that my grandmother gave me."
31,"*gasp* I did not know you returned, Airz!"
32,"&gt; Do not do anything I suggested on a battery fire.

I won't. I like to live."
33,what's in the box.....?
34,"I wouldnt expect the plan to last more than a month, but If i was a CEO - i'd really want to have numbers and transparency to show the rest of the departments how much work IT does, and what the value of IT is.  And know how it could be much, much worse.

Noone working inside the company should talk down to the rest of the staff.  Sales may be the ones to bring in the revenue, but they arent cleaning the bathrooms, making the widgets, or tracking down the customers who dont pay the bills.  In house IT is the blood and nerves of the operation. without it you are working in the stone age.  we all need to work together to make this slow AI function."
35,"Airz needs to write a book, this shite is the most entertaining on the this sub!"
36,I figured they would know from the news that was blowing up but I now realize that was a few years ago. I didn't really think of batteries as special tech stuff as they are in everything. If a AA battery started swelling I'm sure that it would be disposed of
37,"Yeah, there is a bid difference between saying that something is unsafe and that it can explode. I think most people interpretation of ""unsafe"" in the context of computers is that in worst case the computer stops working, or perhaps your banking information is leaked. I don't think explosions is on most peoples radar. And from the transcript it didn't seem like you made this clear, but I guess it wasn't such a literal transcript."
38,"Do you still have the link for the one with sound? I'd like the chronological order link, please."
39,"To the darkness I bring fire. To the ignorant I bring faith. Those who welcome these gifts may live, but I will visit naught but death and eternal damnation on those who refuse them."

41,Yuuuuuuup.
42,"&gt; if I don't get the correct information this port forward will be useless

The port forwarding in my house is set up on my end, but I once couldn't get my Minecraft server running for a few hours because I had accidentally typoed the IP in the port forward setup. I tried for a good long while to fix it on the server machine (to no avail obviously) before I found the typo.

And also there was that one time when I only had the default Minecraft port forwarded (with my correct IP) instead of the one I was actually using. Good times.

Goes to show as an example of exactly how correct you are. I have zero professional networking experience, and I still understood this tale 100%. "
