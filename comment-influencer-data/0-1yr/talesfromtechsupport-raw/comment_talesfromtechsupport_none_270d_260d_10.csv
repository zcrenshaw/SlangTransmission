0,Larry is executive material.
1,"I'm surprised it didn't end with ""so we deactivated $userA's account \*and\* $userB's account."""
2,"Well, damn.. That story is a downer."
3,"&gt;""That is not good enough. Now get me the fucking refund or I will personally make sure that you will hear from my lawyer.""

Sorry, as per company policy I must now terminate this call. Please have your lawyer contact our legal department."
4,Upvoted for the savage closing line
5,"Oh I felt horrible about it; still do. I would have wanted to reach out to my online friends too if i were in that position, especially since they were the only ones I had during that age. Thinking back, there were probably ways around connecting the Xbox to the network that I didn't think of at the time because I was just wanting to get out that situation asap. But maybe it's best that I didn't in case of raising false hopes only to have the firewall deny it."
6,"Well, even a 'non-computer-person' should have known you can't surf on a jailhouse rock."
7,"I still want to know his thought process, what had he been doing since he put the ticket in? How did he think that is what he was getting paid to do. I will never understand."
8,"Classic office politics: turn the wheel the way it goes (a very Hindu metaphor) only more so.  In this case, create something the execs understand - a working group - put yourself at the head, make everybody else do the work, create an artificial blip in sales to show what a good idea it was.  MB will go far.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not logical because non-IT people aren't logical."

Cue dramatic music. "
11,"pencil and paper 1$,

knowing where to hit it: $9999"
12,People who are incapable of using a fucking KEYBOARD should be Constitutionally barred from having a job that in any way interacts with any technology whatsoever.
13,"I have gone to find myself. If I return before I get back, keep me here."
14,"""so we deactivated $userA and $userB.""  ""Don't you mean you deactivated the accounts?""  ""Well, that too ... it's amazing what a few kilos of high explosives will do!""

"
15,"&gt; M:""There's the matter of payment...""

&gt;C:""For reading the instruction manual!?""

No, for wasting my time

​"
16,"I'll admit, the opportunity was there, and I just could not resist."
17,"Subect: Fire

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to inform you of a fire which has broken out at the premises of....

No, that's to formal."
18,Should keep going. Day after day until they have the parts for a complete dead Chromebook
19,"OMG! New Airz? What's this!?

Will we finally find the missing keyboards?"
20,"I don't know if it's unique to IT people, but I think we all acquire this outlook given enough time. I remember a few years ago at a party, sitting around a table with a few other IT people I knew at different companies. One of them concluded a tale of tech support with something like, ""All human beings are all unreliable grifters."" None of us contradicted him--we just sat there nodding in agreement.

Part of me looks back and thinks, ""That's such a messed up way to view the world."" But no part of me looks back and thinks, ""He was wrong about that."""
21,"The trouble with us techies is we're too nice, too trusting, and too literal-minded.  That's why we're usually underpaid and overworked.  Most of humanity are liars and cheats.  Larry isn't any kind of weird exception: he's what people are when they realize they can get away with cheating.  The trick is to spot the liars and cheats, and stop giving them what they want.  If they get hostile, stonewall them.  With luck, they'll get mad and hang themselves."
22,I'll show you ONCE how to do a thing. I'll give you hints the next time you have a problem. There won't be a 3rd time.
23,"True facts. I use the fork lift analogy at work at lot. Replace computer with Forklift and End Users with Forklift Operator. Example:  
If an end user who after several times needs help turning on their computer (True Story).   
""Would a Forklift Operator, still have a job if he had to ask for the sixth time how to turn on a forklift?"" "
24,"2 stories in 1 day from airz, the fuck is this trickery?"
25,"We're so worried about back doors being accessed, we forgot to close and lock the front one. "
26,"You should have her information, just like she should have a microphone."
27,"&gt;Intern: Making coffee, while I watch and learn how to stocktake properly?

Nope, he's on keyboard cleaning duty now. "
28,"I had a guy who wanted contact details for our legal department because he was convinced that I was violating the law with not supporting his issue (incompatible operating system on new laptop). So I told him he would have to send an Email or a letter to our legal office adress... And he responded with ""How the fuck am I supposed to send you guys a letter when your software is not working?!"" Welp... "
29,"Call I once had while supporting some of the earliest CD writers:

&gt; ""There's smoke coming out of the CD burner. It's on fire!""

Please unplug your PC right away!

&gt; ""Oh, we already did that and put the computer outside. We just thought it would be cool to tell you guys that your CD burners can actually end up burning themselves. We know the device is well out of warranty.""

They literally just called because they found the concept of a burning CD burner a pun too fun to resist, and were surprisingly cool about it. Ended up escalating that call to the factory, because even after warranty, these CD writers were not supposed to do that."
30,"&gt; I can’t find the exclamation point key. I don’t see it.  

It's in your wallet.  

&gt;what do you mean? 

Capitol One. "
31,"“Unplug the cord? Ok, sure. Now what? Hello? Are you still there? Ugh, IT is so useless, now my phone’s not working because of them”"
32,A found a spare 2 hours! I couldn't believe it either. Such a rarity.
33,Gen 1 xboxes were pretty pissy about anything but the simplest of network configurations if memory serves. 
34,"Hello old friend.

&gt;Me: Oh peripherals, about that....

I swear I'll die before we know about the keyboards."
35,"&gt; put yourself at the head, make everybody else do the work, create an artificial blip in sales to show what a good idea it was

Looks completely logical (and Machiavellian) to me."
36,"You called.  
I fixed your problem.   
Now you pay me.  

If they didn’t want to pay they shouldn’t have called. "
37,"There was a similar situation in my company a few years back where a user in an office in another state would email one specific guy in IT to reset passwords of other users' accounts.  
He would just reset them to whatever she asked and never thought to question it because she used to kind-of-sort-of do IT for that office before it became centralized to our location, and because users over there tended to go through her for things instead of opening a ticket with us directly like they were supposed to.  
Turns out her boss caught her basically snooping through other employees PCs and emails when they were out of the office, yet somehow both she and the guy who kept changing passwords for her still have jobs here."
38,We got some knock-off iPads from our sales team when they went to China.  We affectionately refer to them as “ChiPads”.
39,"Police? Dang, I would have called the fire brigade."
40,"I had so many questions. 

What key were they hitting? Did they just leave that character off? Were they just typing in whatever trying to buy more time while they searched for it? Do they not know what it looks like?

41,"&gt; Colleague from $User laughing in French somewhere

Hon Hon Hon in background?"
42,"I had the opposite problem for a while. Maintenance techs were switching to their company-issued ""emergency"" cellular hotspots whenever they'd go to one of our remote sites, not realizing that Meraki APs in all our locations serve the same SSIDs and hook back to the main site via VPN. After a few large diagnostic software updates came down through mobile data I was called on to do something to improve wireless coverage and reduce the cellular data bill. It was the cheapest wireless project I've ever done, since I just had to call and tell them they already have wifi."
43,I'll just put this over here with the rest of the fire. 
44,The only appropriate response to that threat.
45,"I remember when I worked DSL tech support.  Buddy calls up with the common complaint that he can't browse any web pages.  So, I go through all the basic diagnostics:  all lights on the modem are solid and green, PPPoE client connects without trouble, browser comes up error 404 for any website.  Okay, let's do some digging.

I ask him to open command prompt.

Him:  How do I do that?

Me: Click start, then run, then type ""cmd""

Him:  Where's start?

Me: *sigh* (this is Windows 98/XP days...it's pretty easy to find) Bottom left side of the screen where it says ""Start""

Him: Okay I clicked Start.  Now what?

Me:  (head on desk) Do see where it says ""Run""?

Him:  No.  I see programs, control panel...

Me:  Yes...below all that...right above Start it should say Run

Him: Okay.  I found that.  Now what?

Me: Type ""cmd""

Him:  It says file not found.  Now what?

Me:  (Teeth beginning to grit).  You typed that wrong.  Click on Start.  Run.  Then ""cmd""  That's ""Charlie.  Mike.  Delta.""

Him:  Where's Start?

Me: (Oh my god!  Are you for real?)  Bottom left corner, sir.  Click on Start, then Run.

Him:  Okay, I clicked Start, but I don't see Run.

Me:  Down at the bottom, sir.  Right above where you clicked Start.  It says ""Run""  In there type ""cmd...Charlie Mike Delta""

Him: (Finally opens command prompt).  Okay, I have a box with a black screen and C:\ and a little light blinking.

Me: Okay.  Type ping.  That's P-I-N-G then space then www.google.com

Him:  P....I....N...G....then what?

Me:  Space.

Him:  Where's that?

Me: ...the big long bar at the bottom of your keyboard.  That's the space bar.  Hit that.  Then type www.google.com

Him: ""File not found pingwwwdotgoogledotcom""

Me:  No....ping space www.google.com

Him:  P-I-N-G then what?

Me:  Space.

Him:  Where's that?

Me:  ARGH!"
46,"&gt; However, the file located there did not require root privileges to be read, In fact it didn't even require them for writing. So any user could add any command they wanted and it would certainly be executed on the next reboot.

that's... impressively stupid."
47,"&gt; Fine, but get some pliers. We have to make sure some of the things in  that room never turn on again, before the VP tries to deploy it. 

this is one of the best things you can do in this situation.  

that and to teach your intern how to properly handle upper management.

&amp;#x200B;"
48,I'm not going to lie. I did a double take to make sure that I hadn't accidentally clicked on an archived story.
49,"A colleague of mine got mad at IT once, because his phone cut out while he was talking to a client. It took him a while to realize that he cut the line himself. Literally. With a pair of scissors. "
50,"Upvote for the title and TL;DR.

Good thing it was just soda. Could've been worse; could've been sand. That stuff is coarse, rough, and gets everywhere. "
51,"It happens to all of us. Thankfully AngryUser wasn't capable of forcing the change. Of course saying ""I said so"" is fun, but usually you get to clean up the mess afterwards...
