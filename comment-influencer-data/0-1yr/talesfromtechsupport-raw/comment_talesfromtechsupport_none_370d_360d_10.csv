0,Oh god! Tech support for printers should have a drunk requirement just for the sake of sanity.
1,"Who the fuck hears someone say ""I want to give you a patch for free that will *stop* your business from getting crippled"" and responds by saying ""stop contacting us, person who we pay money to do this kind of thing for us"""
2,Start either CC'ing or Bcc'ing your boss on anything you send him. people like that like to escalate and blame. make sure you CYA before anything else. 
3,And then you got a bad survey!
4,"Someone who also says ""Bloody IT, everything is working so what do we pay them for?"""
5,"Credit where it's due, he at least realized SOMETHING must be wrong. At least he didn't assume it was your fault and took the time to construct an alternative theory."
6,Jordan was the CIO? No wonder his password was P3terPan! He was the perfect embodiment of the Peter Principle
7,"*Tech did not have a firm understanding of my issue, and repeatedly told me I had to call and speak with someone else as he could not resolve a simple login problem.  Tech failed to properly reset my login credentials a few weeks ago which lead to lost productivity.*
      
As an ex-cable tech, I've had so many bad reviews after going far beyond what a normal tech would do to properly fix an issue that I can pretty much write these myself.  It's an interesting catch-22.  People complain that there are no good technicians out there, and yet all the good technicians get the hell out of industries where the majority of customers do this kind of crap to them.  "
8,"I bet their laptop charger is in the bin, too -- thought it was wireless!"
9,"""Battery acid!""

""Yeah, but. Photography.""

""Battery. Acid."""
10,"It's rather troubling how quickly people get upset with you when they don't understand something instead of humbling themselves and allowing you to explain it in a way that they can understand. If more people took the 'admit I don't know' approach, the world would be a much happier place. Instead, I feel like I live in Idiocracy."
11,"You Manager and Admin might want to look at that contract with SAN Vendor, and bill the SAN Vendor the time you guys had to work."
12,"At least she was somewhat civil about it.

90% of the time when it happens to us, the person on the other end has worked themselves up into a frothing rage and is much more difficult to assist. And they're usually raging because ""we should have known about the problem."" 

No. If we don't see a call or a ticket, the problem doesn't exist. No one here is Professor X. If the issue was that critical to your business, your dumb ass should've piped up as soon as you saw it. "
13,"I have absolutely no idea what your asking.  
  
Edit:Got it.  
&gt; It is now hanging on my wall.   

The letter is hanging on the wall.  I'm still waiting on a quote from the taxidermist."
14,"I am so happy you got this joke, you have no idea"

16,"Yeah, this story sounds like someone is driving down the highway, and their mechanic calls them and says ""hey, the brakes on your car are broken, let me come fix them free of charge"" telling them to fuck off and continuing to drive, smashing into something, then calling the mechanic back and blaming *them* for your totally preventable accident. "
17,Nothing is more permanent than a temporary fix that works
18,"I don't know what it is about them, but computers like blood.

Way back in the day, during an introduction to computer hardware repair class, there was a student in my cohort who was really bad at the in-class assignments (""sabotage "" someone else's practice machine so they get practice solving problems). He wasn't very good at causing damage, and since I was paired with him relatively frequently I'd do things like pre-sabotage it so he'd end up accidentally fixing it. 

Anyway, one time he cut his hand on a hard drive cradle and from then on not a single computer on that side of the room had an error. You could move it to another side and it would throw errors, and move it back and it would be fine.  Creeped me out."
19,This is a super good point.
20,"And that, kids, is the importance of documentation and backups whenever possible, so that someone else can do it if you are not available.

Good job OP for having all of that ready in case something like this happens."
21,"Bravo !!

&amp;#x200B;

 My contrary contribution to a wedding reception's audio was that, after ~~a few~~ several free drinks, the young DJ, a colleague of my wife of two hours, pumped up the volume until it went non-linear, rattled the windows and drove all but a few kids off the dance floor.

Given he ignored several guests' hapless pleading to limit the pain, it fell to me to do something before my wife put him in hospital.

""Turn down the volume, please. **Please turn down the volume.** **TURN DOWN THE VOLUME !!!**""

""Huh ? What's it to you ??""

""I'm paying.""

He peered at milquetoast me, glanced across to where my furious bride was brewing a 'Wrath of Kath', gulped, hastily eased the settings back to 'mostly harmless'. Within seconds, the dance-floor re-filled..."
22,"She sounds like my mom. 

""NeDragons! How do i google 'how to put up canopy'?""

""Well, mom... you can go to GOOGLE and type that shit in.... or read the paper manual that the canopy came with?""

Smh "
23,It as the User or it as the apology?
24,"Actually, since phone batteries are LiPo of some sort usually, it's more like burn your entire fucking house down when they fail."
25,"&gt;In the comments section, you can call me out by name.

""...once you figure out how to access the internet."""
26,I'm sure once things calm down a bit that our IT director and manager are going to have a long conversation with our SAN rep about this. I don't know if they will actually get lawyers involved but they will probably keep that as leverage if necessary.
27,"It's also possible he was entirely convinced it was OP's fault until he got logged in, tried to start on his work, and realized that his key presses were resulting in garbled nonsense. "
28,"Legend has it, Larry is still in a meeting learning how to fill out the form"
29,I'm getting ideas from this... This may end badly.
30,"What ended up happening to them, if you ever heard back?

We have clients on our lowest, trashiest versions of the software. Most people don't like upgrading because it ""breaks everything"" (i.e, custom packages and/or minor functionality, but these issues are usually resolved quick. And our QA team is pretty hardcore). Or they just don't want anything to change from how it's set up. Or they don't want to have ANY downtime whatsoever so customers can buy shit whenever.

Problem is, the lowest, trashiest version is also not PC compliant and is on EOL. So whoever ignored us or told us to fuck off is being forcibly upgraded at the end of the month so we don't get in trouble. 

Software is upgraded for a reason."
31,"I feel your pain. A switchboard caught on fire a few Saturdays ago. I heard about and thought ""I pity anyone that has to work on that""

You can see where this is going can't you...

The board feeds 4 shops, had an asbestos panel and 1 shop had MIMS/Pyrotenax mains. I arrived at work at 8am on Monday and crawled into bed soaking wet at 5am on Tuesday. 21 hours straight and they all had power to open. "
32,Wait these are the Salesman and they should know detail information about the car they are selling? It even reach the manager and he even ask the same question. It seems like both need to pay attention in class more to learn about the vehicles they are selling.
33,"The emails are nice to have just in case, but having your boss or even his boss if you're feeling adventurous, on those emails both limits his options in bringing it up to his management and covers your ass for when/if he does. "
34,users... complain when they have to say anything twice but when you repeat the same thing 8 times your still the idiot for some reason.
35,"Hey OP since I'm in this thread would you mind helping me out? My PlayStation keeps disconnecting from the Internet. It was fine until you glanced in my general direction 5 months ago. I mean it only started acting up this week but it's probably your fault. It's a company-issued PlayStation, I think."
36,"time for a lawsuit also

CYA! big time once this is over the ""fecal matter is going to contact the rotary impeller"", and someone is going to try to ""forcefully move someone to a position beneath a typical public transport""

cya. now. so that you aren't the one ""forcefully moved"""
37,"I'm not sure who is downvoting you. But yeah, I was definitely an alcoholic at the time. I was drunk more often than not to where I remember several times of trying to remember the last day I was sober. I was spending a good amount of my money on booze, and not even expensive booze, just cheap booze to get drunk. I was in a house of two other people who bought me liquor because I was under 21 and just assumed the amount I was drinking was because I was 20 and not because I had a problem. I stopped having things to do sober. Even playing video games, my favorite hobby was a thing I only did while drinking. I was still able to maintain pretty well when this story was from but you're spot on with the beginning stages of alcoholism.  


That said, this was over a year ago, since then I'm happy to say that I was able to cut back on drinking from every day to once a week, to getting completely sloshed every time, to only occasionally getting sloshed. I was able to leave that job for a job that I am in love with and am in general much happier now.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to thank you for reaching out man. Good on you to do that, that's some words I could have really used that about 9 months ago. I hope someone else sees this."
38,"I declined his meeting request and attached a copy of a sample form filled out. Didn't even have any message text.

I'm a goddamn savage."
39,"This is why you should have backups and keep them as long as you can. I can’t stress enough that having backups for your data is essential and should be mandatory each time you want to make any changes or install any updates or clean anything up. Good job, OP."
40,"In my case it was usually, ""Hey Spitfire\_SVK Google this up for me, please... ""

My usual answer was -"" I'm sorry but I'm now playing online match"" where she responded ""pause it then""... 

Maybe that was a reason why I moved out from my Mom's house as soon as I finished my school. "
41,"&gt; long ago, when the graceful plesiosaur still arced playfully through the skies

Wait. What?"
42,Closing the ticket for an unresolved issue sounds like a special form of madness.  I *still* have unresolved issues with tickets that have been open for months.  No way am I ever closing them until they're fixed.  
43,"This really tickles my justice bone.  

&amp;#x200B;

I do tier II support for a MSP and we give support tickets a three strikes rule:  I call and email them three times.  The third email states that I have tried to contact them three times and that their ticket will be closed if they don't respond by the end of the day.  When I close a ticket it automatically generates and sends an email to the user summarizing what happened.  Almost as automatically an angry user will call in because the ticket was closed after they ignored me for a week."
44,"I bought a new car recently and the sales guy (who I know from their sales boards is their top salesman) was totally incompetent.  Instead of having a built-in navigation system they just link it to some app on your phone that then sends the navigation data to display on the head unit.  He couldn't get it to work.  They also have an app that can remote control the doors, windows, and start the engine, but he couldn't get that to work either.  He called the customer support number on the end-user documentation (no dealer support?) and just bitched about it not working.  The support guy sounded nice and was trying to help, but the sales guy couldn't even explain what wasn't working.  He just got indignant and stopped talking instead of even attempting to do his job.  My wife sat in the car with him for about an hour while he tried to figure it out (really he didn't try anything, he just bitched and moaned), then eventually he just gave up and walked off.

&amp;#x200B;

It turns out the dealership never activated the VIN on their end which authorizes the apps to connect.  A phone call to corporate had it resolved in about 10 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

This wasn't my first rodeo, so it went about as well as I expected.  The last time I was car shopping I went to a Lexus dealership asking them about getting an IS-F shipped in.  They told me they had one on the lot, which surprised me since it wasn't online, and took me over to an IS-350 F-Sport.  I told them it wasn't an IS-F, but they really didn't know the difference.  Of course they were willing to give me an \*amazing\* deal, which was coincidentally the price of a IS-350, but they insisted the retail price was that of an IS-F.

&amp;#x200B;

I despise dealers.  I usually walk in ready to buy and know exactly what I want, but somehow it always ends up being a full day ordeal filled with incompetence if I can even get them to sell me the car I want."
45,"""Outsmarted""

Yes, a towering intellect, truly."
46,"You start off your story saying you don't care enough about your job not to drink at work because the working conditions aren't good (implying you don't care if you're caught and fired), but then when you're actually put on the spot while drunk it becomes an ""oh shit"" moment for you mentally. Then you lie to cover up the fact that you were drinking on shift.

I've known a few alcoholics in my life, and this pattern of behavior and thinking is very familiar.
I'm not trying to be a jerk here, but in case no one has told you already: you're either in the beginning stages of alcoholism where you're still more or less able to maintain, or if you're fudging the details of the story to make yourself look like you were more in control than you actually were (which is a common behavior for alcoholics), you're a lot farther down that road than you may realize.

I have a co-worker in AA right now. I can't speak to the effectiveness of the program in general, but it seems to be working for her. Maybe it would work for you. Good luck, man."
