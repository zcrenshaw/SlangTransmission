0,"In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king."
1,Have you considered testing if the keyboard works by repeatedly pressing it it against the users face with enough momentum?
2,"Hey, he had the humility to admit it! Props to him."
3,You either die as tech Support or live long enough to see yourself become User...
4,"We were in the middle of moving from an Open-Source ticket system used by part of the company to a managed service ticket system used by everybody. We had ours down from over 500 teams to three teams left.

One of those teams requested a feature that was in the new system be added to their queues in the old system. I closed their ticket stating ""this system is being retired. We will not be making code changes to it. If you need that feature, you'll find it in the new system, and we'll be happy to help you migrate to it.""

The requestor's manager actually escalated the request, saying that my response was ""unhelpful"", and wanting to know ""how many headcount"" we'd need to write the feature.

Our manager told them ""we'll look into it."" Then he told me ""don't bother looking into it."""
5,"Let me guess, they didn't bring you on as a consultant?

This is where you run the formulas, put your feet up then turn it in one week later, with no assistance. You've still improved efficiency, but you haven't short changed yourself by saving them 9 day's pay"
6,"You provide the product and know how it works, as long as you didn’t know or had reasonable expectation to know it’s intended use then at the end of the day you still did your job."
7,"At the university I work at, a very select few (4-6 high ranking people) can reset a user's password with just their username and birthday. No one else can reset passwords. The password gets reset to the student's ID number that no one is allowed to give out to anyone, not even the student. 

Conversations about it are really short: 

""Ok, your password has been reset to your ID number."" 

""Oh, can you tell me what that is?"" 

""Nope. It's printed on your ID card. You'll have to go to the campus security office and pay for a new ID if you don't know where yours is."""
8,User requires percussive maintenance.
9,Meh. At least the guy ended up setting his rig up successfully. That’s more than I can say for 90% of my user base.
10,Every bit of that long read was worth it for those last few sentences.
11,"You were supposed to come do it for them, didn't you realize that? Remember, these people probably also ""shut off their computer"" by turning the monitor off. ;)"
12,"We had a customer return a prepaid burn phone because ""it was damaged when I bought it"".

The screen was horribly scratched, there was river water and sand inside the phone itself, and the IMEI and serial number on the phone did not match the package.

Yeah, sure, it was in the factory sealed package like that..."
13,"i had a colleague who would run a piece of code,  but had to input different numbers into to it, and get a result.  Like a = 10,11,12,  up to 100,  and b = 5,10,15  up to a hundred,  and c,  and d.   He would do this all day.  for weeks and months.

I needed to use his program,  and did that for about 10 minutes before my brain melted (and of course, errors can occur when you are typing it  in).

I realized that I can run this in a cmd window (command line on MS-windows) and that I can past in the values.   I wrote a quick script to create the ascii file needed to input all those values - including the carriage returns that caused the code to execute.   I just copy and pasted in that ascii (about 5000 runs of the code) and  it worked perfectly.  I did about 1 month of that guy's work in about 30 seconds (plus a few hours while the code crunched away and I went and got a coffee)."
14,"""how many people"" but more dehumanizing"
15,"This also prevents sending you down the slippery slope of everyone assuming you can do everything in 20 minutes. ""Well since the Excel thing only took an hour, you can probably whip us up a new CRM system in Python, right? Please have it done by Friday, I already cancelled our Salesforce contract"""
16,"And then hung up promptly, saving OP precious time."
17,"You should have kept it. Those 4000 series were good for tens, even hundreds of thousands of pages on one toner fill. It practically paid YOU to print."
18,"I once spent MONTHS making different layouts for lists of ""tickets"". Boss at the time wanted tabs, first horizontal, then vertical, then divided by category... that open up the ticket (like an accordeon menu) I gave the users a setting to chose their preferred layout in the end.

No one uses it. They all loved the original layout I had made, because it was just the easiest to use.

Not even Boss uses the other layouts, and he nagged my head off."
19,"&gt; starts violently smash the keyboard to wake the sceens 

Isn't that a legitimate issue to report? I mean that person seems to not only be computer illiterate but also dangerous in some way."
20,Well she did say it was full of shit.
21,This is supposed to be the place we go to to rant at/about users. How'd this cute get here?
22,... until they notice.
23,"&gt;Do you think I'm an idiot?

The answer might suprise you!"
24,"Forget computer skills, a staff member brought in boltcutters and destroyed company property? Why are they still employed?!"
25,"This sounds like the sort of person who expires in the shower because their shampoo says to lather, rinse, and repeat."
26,"&gt; ""Well maybe next time you should ask the person who manages the VM instead of asking your spreadsheet.""

I said something similar to my boss last month and got written up for insubordination."
27,If the server runs on electricity...but the server controls the electricity...then who turned on the electricity for the server in the first place? :O
28,"COMPLETELY off topic but worth mentioning in this thread.  My grandmother lost vision in one eye and lost the other to infection.  One holiday, my uncle made a smart remark.  Grandma gave him ""The Look"" that mothers have.  Even without sight."
29,TLDR: Tech fails to reinforce that computers run on voodoo and smoke. Hilarity ensues.
30,"I considered that, but remembered that I was very much not wanting to stay there for many reasons."
31,I was expecting him to be a burglar
32,"This may technically run afoul of rule 0, but I figured that it might be amusing enough given that I just gave myself the ""$user had something on top of their keyboard"" classic, and I tried to make it into an interesting story. No hard feelings if it gets removed though."
33,"If there's any saving grace, she didn't call you an idiot for her own screwup."
34,I thought you meant those under the desk heaters that they never fail to plug into the BATTERY SIDE OF THE UPS. What is it with those little time bombs?
35,"In Germany we don't call those people ""Micromanagers"" but ""Ameisenficker"" (Ant Fuckers) or Korinthenkacker (Raisin Shitter).
The english language calls them ""Nitpickers"", which is also a fine word."
36,better to have too paranoid than too little paranoid.
37,More people need to use and mess around in excel. The ability to manipulate large quantities of data is so valuable and saves so many man-hours. It's just mind boggling to me that there can be entire departments like yours OP.
38,What was the fall out for the user? I have always asked if i can take used and unwanted or broken items to repair and generally have been allowed but this just taking the piss.
39,"Not a ticket, but I did have a manager pull me into his office and say:

""I don't want to sound like I'm micromanaging, but you were 1 minute late to your desk again today.""

I just gave him a ""really?"" expression and left his office."
40,"When we have surplus kit, I send an email and say help yourself, I’ve placed it ‘here’ and that’s all fine

It’s been passed to his line manager and it’s for them to deal with but the IT department are trying to get gross misconduct passed by HR..."
41,"&gt; ""how many headcount""

What does this even mean?"
42,"At a previous job they had me install SpectorSoft on every machine and give complete access to the company president, who would often snoop on employees. I'd heard that they ""found out an employee was fired for looking for a job elsewhere"" and checked his usage (since he was also being recorded) to find he had grabbed their personal email password from the keylogger, logged in and started reading their personal email. When I left, I made sure to let everyone know that management were recording every keystroke and to change their personal passwords if they ever logged in at the office."
43,"Subject: Fire.   

""Dear Sir stroke Madam, I am writing to inform you of a fire which has broken out at the premises of..."" No, that's too formal. [deletes] ""Dear Sir stroke Madam. Fire, exclamation mark. Fire, exclamation mark. Help me, exclamation mark. 123 Carrendon Road. Looking forward to hearing from you. All the best, Maurice Moss."""
44,"Managers are like children, they want everything right now and they want it their way. But the secret is to give them only what they need not what they want..."
45,You idiot! I built a house out of that case!
46,"The lady that sits on the other side of my cube wall finds that the only acceptable way to wake her PC up is to lash the fucking mouse. 

I don't mean click, I mean pick up the mouse and repeatedly smash it onto the desk. Its violent enough that she rattles the walls and knocks files off my over head bin.

I've given up telling her to press the spacebar and wait. It takes too long but smashing the mouse is more effective."
47,What I need to know is why you refer to your wife as Sybil Ramkin but don't refer to yourself as Vimes or Stoneface?
48,"True, although once you've been told several times that things are fine, you should probably stop panicking."
