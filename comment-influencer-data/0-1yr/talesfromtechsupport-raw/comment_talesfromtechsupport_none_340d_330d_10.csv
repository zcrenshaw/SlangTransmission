0,"It seems like in the time he took to call you all those times, he could have contacted his supervisor about handling the contract extensions.

Maybe his contract wasn't going to be extended and he was trying to pull some shenanigans.

More likely he was stubborn. "
1,"&gt;No really, what state are you in?

Confusion."
2,"Today was a good day on TFTS, 3rd part on Blackhat sysadmin and 2nd part on Angry VIP."
3,Wait until he discovers that those batteries have to be changed every year or two.
4,"Could have had more fun with that... 

""Someone in Sacramento is hijacking your account! Gotta go, starting an investigation!""

\*hang up, disable AD account and go get coffee\*
"
5,"&gt; $Me - Please call $Hit and $EVPIT in here.

Anyone else want popcorn? Dis gun be gud!"
6,"&gt; $me: Well ok then. Is there anything you need from us?

&gt; $user: &lt;click&gt;

No respect, not even a ""No, sorry, have a nice day"". I hate people."
7,"It is a stupid idea but, fortunately for people like him, circuit breakers are designed so that they can still trip even if the switch is jammed ""on"".


If he tried it the circuit breaker would still trip, and he'd have to un-jam it in order to switch it off and on again to reset it."
8,"He definitely should have called his supervisor. He tried telling me that if he didn't get access, the site would shut down. Seems like something to call your supervisor about and ask them to fill out a 30 second form, if you ask me!"
9,"&gt; The elderly gentleman then turned to me and said ""oh thankyou, Maybe you should work here instead"" &amp; packed up then left.

My response: I think they might consider me slightly overqualified."
10,"My favorite interaction with a user thus far was we gave them a first time log-in password with an exclamation mark in it. We test the accounts ability to login before telling them the password just in case we screwed anything up on creation while we are migrating sso. (Permission wise)


Receive a call the next day that they're unable to log in. Ask them what they're inputting and they don't mention the exclamation mark at all. Tell them that it is in fact an exclamation mark, and was provided by this absolute gem. ""Oh, I thought that was an upside down 'i' ""


Amazing"
11,"Vendor_Mgr tries intimidation, threatening a lawsuit at distance.  

Kell's saving throw is successful, and he is able to use the closing distance time remaining to regroup and prepare. 

Vendor_Mgr loses the roll for initiative, and Kell lines up his attack. Everyone watches in horror as the die comes to a rest on 1.!  

Kell is unphased. He pulls his Wand of Ettercap from his cloak, utters some arcane words, and changes the die to a natural twenty before their eyes... "
12,Computer work frequently makes me feel like a mad scientist wanting to cackle gleefully when I get something to work especially when A. it should have not been normally possible or B. Outside the realm of my normal capabilities.  
13,"&gt;  It has already been fixed in the product, but your company is using an almost three year old version that doesn't have the fixes. We have you scheduled already to be updated after the end of the year closing, because of this being a regulated financial system we can't do it until then at the insistence of your CFO.

dang it, I found something else that triggers me :\"
14,"Sadly no, I left this position only to end up at what I would consider the worst-managed company I've ever encountered (I wrote up the tale that made me decide to jump ship [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4aaqli/this_deals_getting_worse_all_the_time/) but they actually ended my employment before I found something else) and then at an [architectural](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4hrfdb/when_it_is_everyones_responsibility_the_ice_cube/) [""software""](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4e5b4w/yes_site_is_slow_but_it_slow_for_all_users_not_one/) [company](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6xmsr4/three_blind_mice/) [for](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4yhmaw/the_four_second_rule/) [a](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/5ab4da/today_i_banished_a_banshee/) [while](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/4jzus1/dont_worry_about_the_stray_tomcat_that_is/).  Currently I'm unemployed, that position having ended at the end of last month, and looking for something new (or hoping to get my citizenship and be able to apply for startup funding for my own company.)

Edit: As to why not a government position, sadly to work for the Finnish government you have to speak both Finnish and Swedish.  I currently can swear in both and that's about it."
15,"&gt;She hung up on me....and then proceeded to call back 2 more times, getting me each time

This is always kind of funny on a busy day. They don't get answer they want, hang up and instead of waiting, call back 1 second later. "
16,This is getting good in a bad way. 
17,"Holy.  Fscking.  *Shit*.

&amp;#x200B;

There isn't enough popcorn in the world, Count.  Or the proper words in my head to describe the feelings this story pulled up.  I wish I had that kind of intestinal fortitude."
18,"Ugh, as a proud newly minted homeowner, this speaks to me on a spiritual level. Trying to figure out what electrical line is running what has been absolute nightmare in our house, I'm working on a new sheet to install in the breaker box because damn near NONE of what's in there is accurate. I feel your pain OP."
19,"&gt; which combined all culminated in me leaving the job where I felt most at home of anyplace I have ever worked 

Hopefully you left this job for a nice cushy government inspector/security auditor position..."
20,"Don't let him know that, he might remove the switch and replace it with a stack of pennies."
21,Holy shit you really pulled back the screen there. Excellent write up and I appreciate the technical detail :)
22,"I swear one of the best reasons to work in the IT department is knowing how to disable your voicemail completely...

Send me an email dammit!!"
23,Or his supervisor doesn't work Saturdays.
24,"""No sir, your own stupidity and gravity broke your phone.  Have a nice day. """
25,"Yeah on the third call she was like ""Its late at night! Go home and let me talk to someone different!"""
26,"It's probably closer to 4-5 years, but with a constant charge going to lithium battery with no exercise it could drop it a year or two.  So, accurate but batteries are more complicated than they seem. "
27,"I'm getting the impression that the vendor is

\*puts on shades\*

*Finnish*ed"
28,[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/9mlij0/when_vip_support_turns_to_avip_support_angry_vip/)
29,A sense of pride and accomplishment. 
30,"Hahaha I love those types of people, they think that they can get what they want because they go to a different person and it grates me but at the same time their reaction is hilarious."
31,"The barcode for a 600ml Coke Zero is a EAN13-encoded 9300675031226.

I have this information for *reasons*."
32,Or his supervisor doesnâ€™t work.
33,"I'd give that person the benefit of the doubt, they were probably incredibly embarrassed and/or having trouble remembering who/what/where they were. "
34,Anything to get out of working I guess. I'm sorry for your pain lol
35,The ultimate scream test. See whoâ€™s supervisor screams first. 
36,"That's how it goes. I had someone spend 45 minutes repeat calling us yesterday to finally say ""Gawwwd, that took forever, I thought you were off for the holiday!"" 


""No, we open at 9, how can I help you?""  

*blah blah blah, can't print to one of 9 available printers within 30 seconds walking distance, unacceptable*

""There was a job stuck in the print queue for the wrong paper size submitted by... you. You could have deleted it or asked your supervisor to delete it.""

""Then what do we pay you for!""

What I wanted to say was ""You pay us by the hour, you paid extra for this call for me to hit the cancel button. What are YOU getting paid for if you have all that time to call before we're open even though it says we aren't open in the greeting?""

What I did was put in a $45 minute bill (minimum charge) for her, ""User claims she was unable to work for 45 minutes. Found and canceled print job sent by user in wrong paper size"". Supervisors love that stuff."
37,"If you can swear in it and ask where the bathroom is, you've mastered the essentials of any language."
38,"At least she'd bought the computer and software before calling tech support?

When I got to ""The what?"" I half expected her to not have actually bought the software yet. That's not saying much but still."
39,Found the supervisor ðŸ˜‰
40,"&gt;less than vague threats about HR.

Not a threat: a statement."
41,"Eh. My handle time can tank it. I just feel bad for the guy who was on hold forever lol. He's the true hero here...

The only pain comes from the people that need to do things asking to send a tech to look at the wires. "
42,"I got reported to HR for being rude and unhelpful by a user...


HR were ready for hauling me over the coals until I explained where and how the incident commenced....

The user had walked up behind me whilst I was utilising a urinal and started into a technical problem, my polite response was to ""please log a ticket for me"".
"
43,"The ""I used to be in IT"" folks always provide a good story for later.  I don't know if they think that if they say that it will provide a shield around them of some sort or think you'll give them a discount."

45,Really? That sounds quite frequent.
46,Did they turn the keyboard around to enter the upside down 'i'?
47,"I came in today looking for Blackhat, and completely forgot we were waiting for this one."
