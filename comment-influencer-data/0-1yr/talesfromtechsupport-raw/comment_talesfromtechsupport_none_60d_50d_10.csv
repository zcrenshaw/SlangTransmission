0,"&gt;What the heck did she think-

You've already gave her way too much credit"
1,"Dude, they know her. They were avoiding her."
2,"Wait, why did Kevin call if he could do the delete himself the whole time? I'm thinking he's not too bright..."
3,"It's possible he knew what he was doing and somehow thought he could blame it on OP's support company somehow if he called in and got them to help him.

&amp;#x200B;

""Oh I didn't know that would delete the balance too, this is all their fault!"""
4,And the sad part is they just moved the VP to another area to fuck that up too...
5,Hopefully he didn’t fire them because of someone else’s shoddy work.
6,"Exactly what we suspected, reason we didn't actually delete it"
7,I hope there's a bonus in here somewhere.
8,"&gt;I don't think I'll be catching crap about my hobby for a little while.

I think this will probably be the only ""bonus"".

It amazes me how many business operations rely of really old kit, and yet don't have any backup devices available for when the kit inevitably fails. Obviously there is no real ""Disaster Recovery / Business Continuity Planning"" happening.  
I would speculate that this is Australia with a ""she'll be right, mate"" attitude, but I've also seen the same attitude in other countries."
9,You know that absolutely happened.
10,"Wow, this is PTSD causing setup right there.  Just reading about storing dll in sql as stored procedure is simultaneously terrifying and ingenious."
11,"Ah the ""known issue"". Aka ""someone raised this once, and we documented it, but didn't see the need to make it known to anyone affected."""
12,"Indeed. In fact, it illustrates a lesson I learned all too many years ago on Usenet.

&amp;#x200B;

A gentleman posted a request for a sorting algorithm for a list of numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

He received a lot of responses, detailing many different algorithms and their advantages and disadvantages.

&amp;#x200B;

One person however, responded differently asking ""Why do you want to sort that list of numbers?""

&amp;#x200B;

The original poster then responded, ""I want to find the smallest number in the list, so I just need to sort the list and then pick the first number in the sorted list."""
13,"Some people just get unlimited leeway to fuck shit up and they get at most a slap in the wrist. Other, competent people are thrown out for the first mistake. Fuck offices"
14,"Honestly, there should be more Bob's in charge.  Even though they *still* don't always listen to reason.

At least this Bob had to deal with the direct consequences of the problem he induced."
15,caller ID FTW
16,Its always the people who think they know everything who crash head first into the gap in their knowledge.
17,You're lucky that disk was still readable at all. Bit rot is a real thing and especially on floppy disks. Magnetic media doesn t retain data indefinitely.
18,"&gt; What the heck, did she think?

No, no she did not."
19,"""hey used to get in trouble when customers would complain and ask to elevate the call to a supervisor, so they developed a system where they pretended to be each others supervisors.""  


The law of unintended consequences, and incompetent management, in ACTION!"
20,"Like, wow. Just... wow.

Didn't anyone tell her the purpose of a deceptionist is to deny **undesirable** access to the boss?"
21,"Twenty people using fired guy's account. Including the manager. Who did the firing.

I'm thinking someone's needing some firing in his life..."
22,He was fired for logging in and putting his name on all the documents.
23,"&gt;Manages to hard shutdown her computer during updates EVERY SINGLE TIME.

This hurt me physically

Great story! Did you ever find out if she made the deadline?"
24,Nothing to do with tech and everything to do with living her life by rote. If you changed her front door from push to pull she’d probably think she was locked out for at least a day.
25,"""You want me to just do shit for free?""

It worked, you did it for free."
26,"Right now all I was told from my supervisor was that she made a complaint and I came here for a quick rant about a problem user. 

Most likely nothing will happen since this is just a user not accepting that I am physically unable to solve her issue. Worst that will probably happen is  verbal warning. But I have only had 3 people complain about my service in the entire time that I have been here (over 4 years now) so my supervisor knows that if there is an issue with a user its generally not my fault."
27,"If they fired her it would mean that whoever hired her made a mistake, can't admit that."
28,This happened about three hours ago. Seriously.
29,"&gt; Worst that will probably happen is verbal warning. 

Why you would even get that is beyond ridiculous.  

You did explain to the user FIVE times that you are, quite simply, unable to deal with her problem because you DO NOT HAVE ACCESS to the resources to address her particular problem. 

It's the user that should  be getting a talking to."
30,"&gt; Honestly, there should be more Bob's in charge.

I couldn't possibly agree more. I spent a lot of years working for losers

&gt; Even though they still don't always listen to reason.

These days, he would. That was an important lesson my training him to be a better boss than most."
31,"I manually back up my database and code base twice a week into a jump drive ever since my boss told me that our code repository gets backed up like once a year, when he also backs up our data servers. It's not just old tech that people dont care enough to back up, it's new shit too."
32,"Gotta love it when a 3rd party vendor says it's not their fault &amp; even when it's proven they do, they still try to blame everyone but themselves &amp; weasel out of it."
33,"You're 100% in the tech support family and getting the DOP to contact IT is the correct answer. If your IT department is smart, they have built in layers of red tape to deal with people like them. 

You don't need to tell them no. That's usually whoever is in charge of security's job (and they're probably right too.)"
34,Last company I worked for all the remote sessions were automatically recorded and exported as mp4 in case of exactly this kind of thing happening.
35,Sounds like a classic [XY Problem](http://xyproblem.info/).
36,a buddy of mine just experienced the same exact thing! i swear people don’t know anything about tech
37,Story seems like it ended early. Want to see what happens after the report.
38,"Some restaurants do this, it's no common, generally bars and clubs. Basically customers open accounts with them and are essentially opening a line of credit. They have to pay it back within a set time period or their card on file will be charged in the full amount owed"
39,Is she a sales rep or is she in HR? Got to be one of those two.
40,"The CEO of my last company demanded admin rights to his machine because “They never work right and he needs to be able to fix it”. My boss relented and not two weeks later he’d crashed it and it wouldn’t boot. We restored from a previous backup and I logged in. 

He had Nvidia, Catalyst Control Center, and Radeon Settings all installed at the same time on a machine that used integrated intel graphics. He had some kind of memory manager that promised to speed up his machine but was using 90% of the CPU almost all the time. He had CCleaner and Malwarebytes running constantly in the background and his browser had a couple of tool bars and a ton of extensions installed. His Symantec antivirus also had a big fat red X on the system tray because something was preventing it from reaching our servers. 

He assured me that was the way he liked it and the problem was with the machine, not what he’d done to it. My boss had me create an image of it for when it inevitably died and told me to leave it exactly as I found it because he didn’t want to tell the CEO no. He even removed the logon password requirement because it “took too long”, on the CEO’s LAPTOP! No hard drive encryption and no password requirement for the guy who had access to everything on a mobile device he could absentmindedly leave some where!

I don’t work for that company or those people any more. And the woman I work for now is not afraid to tell the owner of the company “Prove to me the business need for this change or the answer is no. “"
