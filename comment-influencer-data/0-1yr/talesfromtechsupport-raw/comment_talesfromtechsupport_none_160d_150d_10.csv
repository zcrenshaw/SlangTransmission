0,How do people like that function in a modern office environment?  Pushing the button on the monitor turns off the computer?  WTF?
1,"The car won't move without gas  
  
But I need to go to my grandma's house  
  
Can you send me some gas by email please?"
2,"Wonder if the tech got the ""well I could've done that"" comment when he plugged the cable in. Yes, you could've, that's what the person on the fucking phone was trying to get you to do and you refused. I haaaaaate that comment so much. You could've done it, but you refused to, so now it's costing you a few hundred bucks."
3,"Get an old laptop, wipe it, tell him that you need Windows installed on it, and let him go to it. Should keep him busy for a few days. Maybe a few weeks."
4,Never ever accept gifts or things from customers / clients. They'll hassle you later over them. Plus no idea what's IN that powder.
5,"Dude, at some point you people need to understand end-user jargon.


Everyone knows the monitor is the computer.



The actual computer is, ""the box."""
6,"They usually do from my experience at Moondollars. Often it's also the next supervisor who gets the tech when they show up after initial caller just goes ""Thing isn't working. I called it in"" and no information goes on after that."
7,"How does the server have no powe??? Tou said UPS has it. A UPS is what you use to power the servers when the power goes out right?  That means the server has power.

... ... okay, I feel dirty now."
8,"It said my car was running low on gas so I siphoned out what was left and poured it down the gutter.

No I'm not going down in there!"
9,People like that customer make me wish it was acceptable to think ‚Äúscrew customer service‚Äù and reach through the phone to slap/punch some sense into them
10,"Something like this happened to me but no one believed it was not my fault except for the techs that fixed it. 


A while back I worked for a museum with a caf√© attached to it and we were upgrading some of our equipment. I needed to run an Ethernet cable through the caf√© and just as I connected the cable on the other end, the caf√©‚Äôs entire POS system went down. The cable I ran didn‚Äôt connect to any of their equipment and wasn‚Äôt even close to their hardware, it was just going from one hole in the wall to another but I got blamed for bringing down their system. The next day a technician for their POS system arrived and had to replace their switch and two of their terminals and he agreed it was just a coincidence that their system went down while I was in there but the caf√© owner made such a big deal about it that the museum just paid the $3000 for their downtime and I‚Äôm sure the owner still thinks it was my fault."
11,"So common. 

""What's the computer name? ""

""Dell""

""No, it'll be a white label on the top of the screen. 

""Oh sorry Haha. Latitude E5540""

*rage quit*"
12,"I hate it when ""managers"" manage things into shit And never let them have power over who to fire and to hire. Especially when they blackmail people into telling nonsense to keep their job.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm happy to life in a country where laws protect me from being fired for scratching at a clowns ego."
13,"&gt; We need better stuff.
&gt; Sure. That‚Äôll cost xxx.
&gt; No no no. Just better stuff. No extra costs.

Pretty much every C-Level ever."
14,It means she deals with the $%!@ customers so the engineers don't have to. She has people skills; she is good at dealing with people. Can't you understand that? What the hell is wrong with you?
15,Oh how I love the users who wait until the last minute to ask for help....
16,I wish I could say we don't have any fax machines.  I still install fax machines.
17,It's got electrolytes.
18,"Overuse of extension leads is a problem.

Not maintaining your power equipment is a problem.

Using a UPS instead of a surge protector? Totally normal and fine. Nothing to ‚Äúscream‚Äù about in the slightest."
19,"Sending an email to all staff where I work cc‚Äôs tens of thousands of people and is considered a fireable offense depending on what gets sent because we deal with sensitive information. Our email even gives a warning before you hit send with the number of recipients. 

I‚Äôve only seen it twice while working here. Both people were fired and many others were subject to discipline for replying back as reply all this perpetuating the cycle. "
20,"I once saw that people who work retail should be allowed to fight a customer once per week. 

People in tech support should be allowed to cancel all services from a customer once per week, and ban them from getting new ones for a month. That would be fun."
21,"My favorite poster hanging in the IT office:

""Your failure to plan ahead, does not make your problem my priority."""
22,"Probably hired on originally for being a ""people person"" whatever that means.."
23,"I didn't read the story or any comments yet, just the title.  I'm going to guess that they turn off the monitor every night, and think that's their computer.

Having made that guess, I will now read the story."
24,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I, for one, welcome our Google overlords.

Good on ya, OP. You'll go far with that kind of thinking."
25,"""Oh yeah? Well, every time you steam someone's latte, I take a sip of my coffee and it's gotten colder.""

""Yes, coffee does that when it sits.""

""I demand to see your manager!"""
26,"Reminds me of a laptop that landed on the PC bench at work long ago with a perfect knuckle print on the broken screen.

The excuse? ""Baggage handlers at the airport must have done it.""

Yeah, buddy. Let me grab a micrometer and go a little CSI on your knuckles (which seem to be healing nicely, by the way). You lost your Ebay bid on whatever weeaboo shit you wanted, you punched your screen, and we both know it."
27,It's what plants crave.
28,"""You can't do this, the customer is always right!""

""Sir, you are NO customer.""

""What?""

""Doors to your left."""
29,"&gt; acted like she didn't know how to use a computer

She literally didn't know how to use a computer. Shutting down from the Start menu has been a thing since 1995. Even longer for Mac users. "
30,"Well, can you fix it please?"
31,"Pls upgrade?

NO PAY!!!

ONLY UPGRADE"
32,"like my coworker says, ""There's only two things a good IT person needs to learn: How to google and how to bull shit."" lol"
33,"Oh good lord, how many bottles of scotch do you have in your desk drawer? "
34,"And the user won't be trying to restart it every time they have a problem, either. Ingenious. "
35,"Courtesy of our cafe manager:

&gt;""Employee X saved some files to the file share from the Acer in the office, but she can't find them when she logs into the HP.""

In this case, I ... have no idea which computer she's talking about. There are only 2 PCs in the cafe ""office"", but since they're both custom builds (with different cases), and both have Acer monitors (different sizes) and there's no HP anything ...

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and we're moving to these tiny Dell PCs that hook onto the back of the monitor. Because that's not going to confuse the shit out of people (fun fact: it already has.)"
36,"Let me get this straight...

You want to take your document made on the computer, translate those electronic bits into ink on paper, then translate them back to electronic bits, translate those into sound and transmit it through the phone system, 

The phone system turns them back into electronic bits, and then back into sound at it's destination.

Where they will transform the sound into bits, and then translate them to ink on paper. After which there is a good chance it gets copied into bits on a computer again for storage.

This is what you think you need?"
37,"&gt; ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you just remote into my computer and fix it?‚Äù  *Listen*

ü§£ü§£ü§£ That one got me. I‚Äôm still rolling over that 5 minutes after reading it the first time. "
38,please do the needful.
39,"I also heard of it being referenced as ""the modem"". "
40,If I found out someone working for me called a $250 tech and left a register offline for hours because you where to lazy to spend a few minutes troubleshooting I'd fire them on the spot.
41,A lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine.
42,"My old boss that I really, really dislike had a saying that I actually still think about sometimes: 

""Your lack of planning is not my emergency."""
43,These are the same people who ship their laptops in for service and I open the box and it's with their e-mail client running along with 4 unsaved documents. 
44,"""I really don't have time for this.""  But you have few hours to wait for someone to do it for you? Brilliant... Okay, as a former helpdesk person I should know better.."
45,"So, back in the DOS/Windows 3.1 days, I heard about a similar call.  Agent asks the user to reboot the machine and log back in.  User says, 'okay....done' in 10 seconds.  Boot times took at least a minute and a half.  The agent said, ""No, please turn off the computer and then turn it back on.""  The agent hears a click and the unmistakable sound of the CRT powering down.  He facepalms.

""Ma'am, you need to turn off the VCR part, not the TV part."""
46,"As an employee, there definitely tends to be awful communication between shift changes a lot of the time"
47,Well that escalated quickly..
48,"No, 16 + 16 = 2B. Ya can‚Äôt just switch bases in the middle of an equation!"
49,Can a brother get some paragraph breaks?
50,"We have an efax client and fax machines.  Many users have both but only use one.  Some people consider the old fax the most 'secure' method of communication.  Since the individual departments pay for their own equipment no one wants to take their eqiupment away.  Good news is, when the old phone lines break, they don't get repaired so that's something."
51,"Reasons to bring back CRTs:

1. Weight can be used as a weapon

2. Electron beams shooting phospher dots is way way cooler than individually addressable pixels

3. Curved by nature. you have to pay for that now

4. It looks cool.

5. The power down sound makes an instant ""user doesn't know simple words"" alarm

6. User probably can't move it to unplug random stuff"
52,"For more pain, tell him you need arch on it :p"
53,"&gt; C: No, it's not. What's the real story?

Okay, you caught me. It's aliens. They're working to disrupt our TV infrastructure in an effort to improve our median intelligence."
54,"""Sorry, employer policy is we can't accept gifts. Thank you for the offer, though."""
55,".... yup, that's what happened.  Sigh."
56,"I'm honestly kind of surprised she didn't misunderstand UPS the shipping company with UPS the piece of equipment and I'm PRETTY sure the only reason that didn't happen is everyone at the company calls those ""battery backups"" instead."
57,"I hope this is a true story because it‚Äôs pretty great. The cherry on top was that you actually tried to help that person and didn‚Äôt lose your shit in the face of such stupidity.

My advice is move up into Tier2, don‚Äôt linger in a Tier1 customer facing role any longer than you need to - unless of course you love that work.

Here‚Äôs a little something for you and good luck in your new role!

58,"I had a customer refer to it as ""the amodium"" once. "
59,"We had an outsourced/downsized user use the .all mailing list to air his grievances before leaving.  Secrets exposed, rumors confirmed - it was *ugly*.  Add to it the reply to all responses and it was general hysteria.

It took about two days for the .all list to be forcibly secured so that only the official Communications team could use it and there was an executive approval process to go through for them to use it as well.  At the time long ago, we were a Notes shop, so there was no fancy automatic restriction process.  The Messaging team had to open the list, let Comms send the email, then close it quickly to keep reply to all's from flooding the system.  "
