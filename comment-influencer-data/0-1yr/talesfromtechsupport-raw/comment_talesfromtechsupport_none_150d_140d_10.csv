0,Should of flipped it back ay him. You wanna talk to my manager? I want to talk to your manager and inform them of how you lack reading comprehension and are also trying to create security risks
1,"I had a weird one like this when it came to ""family tech support"".

Wife shows me a PDF she printed. It's full of garbage and blocks where the text should be. But only with certain fonts. And it looks perfect onscreen. I print the same PDF, from the same site, using the same computer, on the same printer. It prints fine. 

What. The. Fsck. It's not the PDF, it's not the drivers, it's not the printer. There's only one thing left. We're on a Mac, she prefers Firefox, I prefer Safari... it couldn't possibly be that.

It was. Firefox has its own PDF engine and apparently (on Mac at least) it's been broken since Firefox 64. Even better, it only trashes printing on *some* PDFs, *some* of the time. 

tl;dr: Printing from Firefox Quantum is non-deterministic."
2,"""so maybe keep trying or see if someone better at matching shapes hasn't left for the day""

&amp;#x200B;

Holy shit. Don't dry out under all that SALT"
3,Thank goodness the manager had your back and had some sense...
4,"That means she failed it, which means a weak point in most vulnerable attack surface was identified. Yes it's embarrassing, but by no means a waste of time. Better a test than actually installing malware."
5,Unexpected error: there is no error.
6,Someone's been honking at me every time I pushed the middle of my steering wheel!
7,"*$P: I've never plugged it in. I threw the charger away.*

Translates to "" It's your fault and I want you to fix it now, just send me a new unit""

/sigh"
8,Sorry for the caps but I swear to you her entire side of the conversation was screamed while Michael Bolton sang in the background about how he said he loved me but was wrong.
9,"I feel like you are me?  I talk with the IT guy at my office often like this - always in a ""scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"" don't tell your boss you are helping me kind of thing."
10,Nice one. This is how you get pay rises/promotions.
11,"Oh shit, didn't even occur to me. You know, funny thing, in Outlook, you can look up any employee and find out about everything work related, who's their manager, place of work, position, etc.

I should have used that against him. Buuuut I am nice dude."
12,"&gt;I reach down an unplug her computer's power. ""Thank you,"" I say as I walk away.

Like a boss.

Also, good call on the manager, for once."
13,"You know what the worst part about the embarrassment of falling for a stupid trick is? When somebody (like this particular husband) decides he’s going to be your White Knight by calling *a massive amount of attention* to your fuckup. 

Now it’s not just some random IT guy who knows workingwifey@company.com is insecure with her email. Now a few dozen higher-ups know that Debbie (specifically by name) is a fuckup, because her husband couldn’t keep his cool. That sucks."
14,"Some people astound me with their co.plete lack of sense. 

I had set up a guide with full pictures for a user and sent it to them. It was for an RSA token. Step 1 was to download the app from the app store. (With 1a, 1b etc showing how to get to app store and then download an app). Then step 2 was to download the token, which the app would read.

User calls me around late at night (my work number was in my email signature) and says she is stuck. I decide to help because she has been failing at this for a week, and at the time, closing a ticket for ""user can't follow instructions"" just gets more fault tickets opened. 

I ask her where she is stuck. She says she downloads the token in step 2 and it says there is no app that can read the file type. I ask if she downloaded the app. ""Oh no, i thought I needed to download the token first"". Somehow she read the instructions and thought that Step 2 is the place to start at"
15,"&gt;Me: So we're still waiting on ISP ALPHA to tell us what they fixed before we close the outage ticket.

*look at me. say it. SAY IT!*

*aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh yea.*"
16,"You to AM: ""Great.  Well, once the documentation comes through the proper channels, we'll start dealing with that"", until then, I hear there's a camera you should do something about."
17,"For this story, if on Windows 10, PDF could be opening in ""Microsoft"" EDGE. which it defaults to after every gol darn update"
18,"I've learned in both of my jobs that you should make friends with someone in IT. ideally someone who you prove to that you aren't completely incompetent, and is willing to bend some rules."
19,"Theory: On Windows 10, Edge sets itself as the default handler for PDF files. Result: ""My Microsoft keeps printing black boxes on my file????¿???????"""
20,"15min multiplied by how many employees were waiting?

Because that's how much money/salary she wasted."
21,OP took the biggest of risks here
22,"&gt; about how he said he loved me but was wrong.

That's the kind of detail that should be put *in the story*, preferably in the lead. That's quote-of-the-day level material."
23,"Probably the best way to deal with ""I'm a big shot and I don't do that"" is to contact the Executive Assistant and get them to do it.  The flunky probably does all the legwork anyway, and may even be smarter than the exec."
24,This is the kind of people who buy a new car when their old one runs out of gas.
25,TDIL^(^That ^Day ^I ^Learned): There are still people using AOL for mail.
26,Unexpected error: occurred between the chair and the computer.
27,"Sorry but the first rule of tech support is, the customer lies."
28,"I was nearby when one of the helpdesk staff received a call from a doctor’s wife (hospital IT). Her husband asked her to call to deal with getting him access remotely as she worked in IT at another company and he didn’t deal well with “computer things”. So the tech is on the phone with her trying to explain how we can only assist HIM and how the doctor will need to be on the line so we can have him login. Then I hear the tech “No it doesn’t help that you have his password, I need to work with him”... hold up. I asked the tech to put it on speaker.

“Excuse me, this is Libriomancer from IT department. Can I ask what this call is about.”

“Hi, I am Doctor’s wife and I am trying to help get my husband’s device connected remotely.”

“Is there a reason Doctor is not calling in as we really are supposed to only support him and he’ll need to enter his credentials.”

“Oh my husband is terrible with computers and I work for IT at Xyz Inc. Don’t worry I’ve got his credentials so we can get it all working.”

“To be clear, you just said you HAVE his credentials and not that he is there driving the computer with you assisting in explaining what we are asking him to do? Does Xyz Inc encourage sharing of passwords?”

“Well no, but he really needs to sign reports tonight.”

“You are also aware your husband is a doctor correct? So the credentials you have provide you access to private medical information that is protected by law.”

“Well I...”

“I appreciate you want to help but at this time I’ll have to ask the helpdesk to reset his password and not assist him in getting it until he has spoken with either the Security or Privacy Officer. If he needs it sooner than he can get into the office he can call the admin-on-call and they can speak with the head of IT. As stated earlier, my name is Libriomancer and the helpdesk is doing this at my request.”


She was annoyed to no end but come on, you should know better ESPECIALLY if you work in IT. Doctor tried once to call back in to get his password but small helpdesk staff and they all heard. Next day one of them was helping test his remote access in the department and Privacy Officer was with them and knowing her.... he had a fun morning."
29,Usually it's not much of a risk - you already know what your relationship with your manager is like.
30,"When I used to host LAN games at my house we always saved the one red Ethernet cable for the host

It's faster
It just is
It's like racing stripes, the red cable is faster than the blue ones."
31,"Dude you have balls of steal, if she took that the wrong way you're out on your ass ahaha.

Hard to come back from pissing off the ceo of your biggest client.

Well played. High risk high reward Ahahah."
32,"E-Mail, the bane of my existence. Always a headache to figure out which piece is broken."
33,IT can be your best friend or worst enemy.  :)
34,"Oof. We've been putting our MSP clients onto Duo for VPN connections. Didn't encounter anything quite this spectacular, although we did have the President of a company sign up for mobile authentication notifications and then proceed to call in frustration because his login kept ""spinning out"". 

In our setup you're supposed to tap on Duo notifications so that the app can open, and you can approve your connection and verify that you are the one trying to sign in. He was under the impression that simply receiving the push notifications counted as approving the connection. It would legitimately try to connect until it killed the attempt, since it never received approval from the user through Duo.

His response? 

&gt;Well I'm the President, why do I need my own approval?

Good times."
35,"Ticket opened.

Problem: User can’t read or count.

Solution: Informed user that “Step 1” comes before “Step 2”.

Ticket closed."
36,"Finally, concrete proof that printers are possessed.

/s

&amp;nbsp;

^^sort ^^of"
37,Send bacon!
38,"This. The amount of calls I get saying ""I can't view my PDFs"" is insane. I hate Edge!!!"
39,I had an instructor back when I was first studying IT tell me that in our field if you are working hard you are are doing it wrong.
40,I hope your manager lit into the AM about how to communicate. ^^(one can dream can't they?)
