1,Nope the company wide email sent out by VP of accounting insured that the bonuses will flow. Just not to IT. Because IT does not get bonuses. 
2,"&gt; Just not to IT. Because IT does not get bonuses.

Sounds like it's time to hire a couple ghost employees."
3,"I remember a student like this when I was tutoring at university. I was teaching a piece of software over the term and I would have to teach my PC the basics again every week.

One time he came to class and explained he'd been working on his files at home (as they were expected to) but he couldn't see any changes. Somehow he expected his home files and the ones on the university computers to magically sync."
4,"""I don't understand what you're talking about, so that can't POSSIBLY be the issue"""
5,"&gt; Yeah, but he'd better watch his back for a while... 


This is IT. We're already regarded as a cost center that can be beat up whenever marketing doesn't deliver. You guys know the score. Even in this microcosm, this one company, people rush to take credit from IT when things save money, but then shift blame and cost to us. Both were in play here. And in an exciting reversal, they got called out on it.


Sad truth is, most people don't know what the fuck IT really is. People in my field even -- they honestly believe it's just ""computer stuff"". It's not. IT is the interface between business needs and technology -- it's a *people problem*. 


And this guy just brilliantly demonstrated that principle in action. He solved a *people* problem, not a technical one. Technology was just the *vehicle* by which the problem was solved. That's most of IT, right there. 


We have huge technical support departments in places that mostly reset passwords because the company won't pay for training, so instead they pay more in lost productivity because people don't even know how to reset their password, or they forget it. Why are we even using passwords? Easy: It's cheaper than two factor. Companies don't want to spend the money to issue people a RFID card or dongle so they can just login by shoving a card in a slot. Maybe even the same one they swipe every morning walking into the building. 


And for anyone who thinks that's too insecure -- open your wallet. Your credit card is the same thing, with an optional 4 digit pin (hahaha so secure!). A 4 digit pin that with none of this stupid ""and change it to another 9000 character random alphanumeric fuck stick because policy"" plus a dongle. Boom. Your shit's now a hundred times more secure than the password/phrase only system... but yeah, it does cost a smidgeon up front. And it'll pay for itself in *months*. Imagine how happy the users would be not having to keep a post-it note with their password somewhere because policy forces them to memorize something they're going to forget in a few months. It's worth it just in worker morale.

Penny wise, pound foolish -- it may as well be the field's motto, because 90% of what goes wrong in IT can be traced to someone cutting corners and then getting bit in the ass by it later when a bunch of infrastructure gets built on top of it. This field is an unending shit show of people in and out of the field who don't understand the role IT plays. It's there to reduce costs -- a continuous refinement of business process which focuses on (but not exclusively) technology. 


The point of performance in this field is where the employee interacts with (or not) the technology the business owns. Not the technology itself. You find yourself with a CEO or CIO that understands that, and you've got a powerhouse -- *if* you know how to leverage that understanding.


This guy did. He doesn't need to watch his back. He needs people that recognize he had theirs the moment they gave him a reason to. And if they don't do that, then the CEO needs to hire some people who understand their role is to back him up, like he just did for them. 


What he did here should be the meter stick by which management views IT. Let us look at the business process and offer suggestions on managing them. Don't paint IT into the all too common X-Y problem that results from an incomplete understanding by management of the role of IT. You do that, and you're not utilizing your engineering talent. It's bad business. Give them a problem to solve, not a solution to implement. *That's* what IT should be. Should. 




"
6,"Well done, especially with calling out those other departments. "
7,"You name the employees Em Bezzle and F. Raud and take the money from the company! So easy, Bernie Madoff could do it!"
8,"""I just bought this car a week ago and the LOW FUEL light is already on! Something has to be wrong with it to break this quickly!"""
9,How does she handle TV commercials ??
10,"How hard is it to download a damn app? I'm assuming the instructions that were sent out to everyone included a link described as something akin to ""this is a link to download the app you will need""."
11,This is why people get murdered with hammers.
12,"This takes me back to when I did my AAT at my local college. AAT is like a foundation course for those who want to do Accountancy. I didn't work in IT before but I'm pretty switched on. 

In our 2nd year we had to sit two modules one on Excel and one on Sage. We had a PC in those classes. Now our PC was bright, and had sailed through the other bits in the course.

When it got to these computer modules she'd suck up all of the tutors time and I heard her say ""Why are we even doing this? It's not like I'll be working with computers""

She wanted to work in accountancy and didn't think Excel would play a part in that."
13,"&gt; Me: ""Did this radio do anything weird when you plugged it in?""

&gt; Installer: ""No, Well...Yes. It sparked at me.""

It's always like pulling teeth to get the relevant info. It shot sparks, and he didn't think to mention this fact. It's like troubleshooting a car over the phone:

""Did it do anything weird when you turned the ignition?""

""No, Well...Yes. The engine caught fire."""
14,"I needed longer than I'd like to admit to understand how you get bonuses with that.

But after this story... Nobody will question it"
15,"I've done this.  My first sysadmin job was in 1996 so I'm not inexperienced.

Also - the number of times I've shut down my laptop and then left work with the darn thing still on the dock on my desk... grr."
16,"""I can appreciate your frustration but this is the loaner, this is how things work. If you want us to fix your laptop you can wait, or take the loaner.""

Shut that shit down and fast. You didn't lock her laptop. You are trying to fix it."
17,"Yeah, but he'd better watch his back for a while... He may be in the spotlight right now, but he also embarrassed a bunch of people in front of the CEO. "
18,&gt;Now we have an extra 24+m to spend on ~~expansion of the company.~~ bonuses for the management team.
19,Welcome to being a background worker where management can't or in this case won't point and say look at what they accomplished. These dolts care more about the cars finish than if it actually has an engine much less the oil required to run the engine. They tend to view IT as little more than overpaid janitors. 
20,"yep. link, screenshots, step-by-step instructions, everything.  
We made it as detailed as we possibly could to avoid this kind of crap.  
It's not even that many steps."
21,"Holy Shit, you guys saved the company 24 Million and get shit on?"
22,"Not wanting to ask a question and look stupid, so you don't ask."
23,Can I work for you? Every year we have to argue and beg to show justification for 8 people to support 900 in 5 offices on 3 different continents. We just got bought by another company that is even more thrifty and I'm just getting tired of it.
24,"*From an unknown source on the Internet*  
  
""911, what's your emergency?""  
""I'm lying in a pool of blood.""  
""Is it...*your* blood?""  
""Yeah, I think so.  It's probably coming from this stab wound.""  
""Were you stabbed?""  
""Oh, yeah definitely."""
25,BTDT. I always wonder what they are thinking...
26,Buy everything
27,"There are always going to be those users.

I built an application where I knew users might get hung up on a particular part. Moreover, I knew my users would just click OK on any message I put up. So I made the message appear 300 times unless they'd resolved the issue. A sort of arms race if you will. Worked surprisingly well, except for this guy:

$user: I'm getting an error when I try to use $application.

$me: What error are you getting?

*$user types the exact $error.message I'd hardcoded into the application. It was displayed in a Windows modal popup, so there wasn't any copy+paste possible.*

$me: Have you tried $error.message.

$user: One sec.

...

$user: Okay, it seems to be working right now.

That was the moment I knew that there are those users who will never read anything."
28,"That doesn't bother me nearly so much as when I've taken my laptop home, and then get to work the next morning and realize that I left it at home.  Sometimes, I brought my personal laptop instead, which was also black.  The third time I did that, I put yellow stickies on it saying ""DON'T TAKE THIS TO WORK!""  One morning, I did anyway."
29,So... Do y'all have a contact us page now??
30,Yeah. Happens sometimes. 
31,"""Doc, I don't understand this whole 'kidney failure' thing you keep saying, so I don't think that's what's wrong with me"" "
32,"The year 2018, Bill had managed to unplug a cable from a mains socket, the first time he'd ever done so, filled with pride, he proudly stood holding that cable.

30 seconds later, he'd forgotten how to breathe."
33,"I’d love to see the look on her face after slogging through all of that with the continued mindset that “we’re never going to use Excel”, only to meet her first client whose entire ten-years of accounting record are in a single excel workbook that’s been macro’d to oblivion."
34,"""Computers/the internet are magic and know exactly what I'm thinking"""
35,"This was getting really long, so I cut this part out, but a few hours after the crash, her alarms started going off on her phone every 10 minutes, marking the minutes as we worked on the first few attempts to get in. You can turn them off by pressing the power button, but safe to say that that phone was kept in another room at night. lol"
36,"We (545,007) subscribers won't tell a soul!"
37,You missed B. Eerfund and I. T. B. Onus.
38,"I had a faulty iphone flash that ruined any photo taken with the flash. That is, until I removed the plastic over the camera that was reflecting the flash's light back into the lens."
39,"&gt;  I *tried* to do it wrong and couldn't shoot myself in the foot 

&amp;#x200B;

If you make something idiot-proof, they will find a better idiot"
40,"&gt; Now the lady that runs the hotel is asking for me to get further involved in this nightmare and talk to her divorce lawyer.

For your hourly rate, sure."
41,The buttclench tho.
42,Nope lol but I passed it on to my supervisor!
43,The technical skills saved your job.  Your office politics skills saved Ash's.  nicely done.
44,"I inherited an application used exclusively by, shall we say, ""rough"" employees. They'd constantly call in to say things weren't working just to get out of doing their work. I added a Do Not Click button that could only be reached by going through a series of unrelated steps. The application keep a count of clicks per user and sent them to a leaderboard.

On the first day one guy recorded more than 200 clicks and sent a ticket literally stating ""The Do Not Click button is broken. Nothing happens when I click it."""
45,"I feel you on things out of reach, like explaining the play button. Once had someone get mad that ""when I hit play, it turns into a pause button!"" Yes because it's playing.... ""but it says pause!"""
46,"And here I was all prepared to tell the story of the preschool lady that fed my peanut allergy kid a peanut butter sandwich because ""they didn't know peanut butter had peanuts in it"". But damn. Your story is better."
47,"&gt; Glassweaver

That's someone who builds something from the molten sand left behind after everything gets nuked from orbit, right? Because this clusterfsck sounds like a prime target for a site-wide NAP."
48,"Yeah I remember one time I was trying to explain the setting in a browser where your tabs will restore after you close and reopen it. She just did not get it, and eventually your terms can't go any simpler. ""So you see these tabs that are here, right now if you closed Firefox they'd all go away, but if we change the setting they wouldn't"" ""Ok"" ""Do you see what I'm saying?"" ""No"". My theory is that people assume that a concept is going to be too hard to understand before they try to understand it. It doesn't bother me when people don't understand technology, but if it's clear that they aren't trying or ignoring me it can get a little frustrating."
49,"When my area started working with our current vendor, they sent a trainer to teach us how to write custom .Net code for their application.  All of our developers had to take the course, which was supposed to cover their API &amp; what not.  Well, somehow my class got a non-developer in it.  And this was what I experienced, just with programming basics instead of PC basics.  So instead of us learning their API, we had to relearn how to program, like how to construct an IF statement or what classes were or basic OOP.  I wanted to strangle that person &amp; to this day can't stand to be in a meeting with them.  It hasn't gotten any better &amp; that was 4.5 years ago."
