"Some people are asking for the other stories. All at the same wedding mind you. (Most of what we do is really classy, I promise.) 

Whenever I video I try to get as much as the bride and groom dancing as possible. Usually people make way for the camera as soon as they see it and are really nice. I'm filming this perfect shot of the bride. People are jumping in with her to dance which is awesome! We want guests interacting like that. This one guy jumps in front of my camera sticking his tongue out would not get out of my way. I step, he follows. Ruined the shot. Didn't even get him because he's so close the focus was off. 

Accidentally caught another older man lasciviously groping a younger girl while dancing. Dressed hiked up and all. About the same time, a group of 4 (2 m 2 f def older than 40's) were dancing while doing the tongue waggling between 2 fingers gesture. 

My partner was filming and a lady kept pestering him-""you have to get this shot; ooooh record that; did you get enough of John Smith?? (Who is of no importance, just a random guest"" ruined a couple his good shots with her hands in the camera. 

And we always get guests saying their well wishes into the camera. Had one group yell that they wished they had a good time tonight with accompanying motions. They weren't referring to the reception. "
