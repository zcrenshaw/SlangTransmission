"[Google's Arts and Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/), it's also a website. 

Basically Google unbeknownst to most people teamed up with art galleries and museums worldwide to take extremely high def pictures of thousands of pieces. There are paintings, sculptures, posters, historical artifacts, photographs, etc.You can explore if by movement, historical events, specific colour, artist, whatever. There are ever changing curated online exhibits, virtual tours of museums, extensive articles.  They're also working on lots of fun experimental toys, trying to play with where art and technology mix. 

A must for any artist or history fan."
"Oh yeah I def did that in middle school, along with those plastic bracelets that were supposed to signify how “far” you’d gone with someone, as if anyone was getting laid in 7th grade lol"
"I am Indian and my ninth grade English teacher liked to tell me (often) that I’m brown because I’m burnt from the inside out because we eat so much spicy food. Then she would laugh hysterically while it was sort of awkward and uncomfortable. I don’t know what compelled her to repeat that joke over and over again over the period of me taking her class. She also separated me out and made me move my desk to sit next to her when I was talking to classmates when I wasn’t supposed to be, but didn’t separate anyone else out. Not sure if racism or just ignorant but was def selective with who she punished."
"My job requires me to to pretty basic addition/subtraction/multiplication all the time and you bet your ass I've punched 13 X 3 into the calculator every damn time. Like, I know the answer is 39 but I just can't bring myself to not double check.  
*ps I def made sure the answer was 39 with a calculator before making this comment*"
