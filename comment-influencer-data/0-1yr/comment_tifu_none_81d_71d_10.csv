I can't believe you didn't even accept coloring with him once.
The best part of this story is how well you two communicated your points of view and were able to make it into a joke. That kind of shit is what good relationships are built on.

Well, of course... because you are using your eyes to see something that isn‚Äôt there, and that isn‚Äôt what visualization is.

It‚Äôs being able to know what an Apple looks like without seeing it. It‚Äôs knowing what your house looks like when you aren‚Äôt there. 

Don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with you, and you aren‚Äôt different than anybody else, you just don‚Äôt understand what visualization is from other peoples perspectives."

Yup. He didn't fuck up by fucking his girlfriend. He fucked up by fucking his girlfriend on her strict parent's couch! Honestly if I was her parents I wouldn't care about the sex but the family couch? Even virgins know how many fluids are involved in sex.
Nothing in this post is the right kind
I have a terrible sense of direction and if I want to walk a few blocks down to the supermarket or something I have to visually 'walk' the path in my head to make sure I'm going the right way. I'm sad to learn something like this exists and people can't imagine the world of books.

"When I was 25 i read an article about tinnitus (incurable ringing in the ears). Up to that point I thought that having trumpets in your ears is the normal sound of silence. I had no issues with it and even slept normally. 

That article informed me that it wasn't normal. I saw a doctor a while later and apparently I have severe tinnitus (50 decibels). The kind that gives people depression and anxiety, interferes with their sleep and even sometimes drives them to suicide. I had no issues with it up until that point because I thought I was normal. 

After the diagnosis, I started having trouble sleeping, I got anxious and even had occasional panic attacks because of the ringing. Now I can't sleep without a fan pointed at the wall going at max speed. 

I kinda wish I never found out about it. I was perfectly happy and content until I read that article and now it's all I can think about. 

My point is: try to remind yourself that you lived a normal life before making that realization. There was absolutely nothing wrong with you as far as you were concerned. If it's possible, try to forget it and never think about it again. Just keep repeating to yourself that what you have is good enough. 

Nobody gets a perfect body or perfect health. Everyone has a couple of defective parts in their bodies. And the very few who don't will definitely develop defects within a few years. We all end up as worm food anyway. The trick is to take what you have and use it to it's maximum potential before you leave this loud world and all of its trumpets behind."

Yup absolutely.  I spent a few months there myself and absolutely there were times where going in for a massage they'd be trying to work me up for more with a brush here or a tap there.

"I had this problem every time I went for a massage. Id go in with no intention at all of receiving a happy ending but they'd always entice me somehow by maybe moving their hand around my inner thigh or ""accidently"" touching it when they'd be massaging my stomach, or making my hand 'accidetally' touch their tits. Then once the beast was awoken, they'd ask for 'extra service' and $30 payment. I'd be too horny by then to refuse. I'd always be trapped into it, until I sat down and made M0SHKA's cardinal massage rules. 

Rule 1: ALWAYS pre-wank. If possible, wank twice. 

Rule 2: NEVER carry extra cash. Even if somehow, she still manages to get you hard after rule 1 (happened before), you need to make sure you don't have any money you can pay her. 

Rule 3: Prevention better than cure : Think about people who died in my family and other sad memories during my massage. (This one got me more worked up than relaxed during a massage once and I almost cried.)"

My friends mom had something similar happen. Babysitter started her period while watching youngest sibling. Called her sister for a change of clothes.

Turns out my 10/10 GF was FaceTiming my mom who was in the process of doing the morning announcements at school.   SO THE ENTIRE school now knows what‚Äôs going on.  And to make matters worse, CNN was there doing some story about some kid who broke his arms - and the announcement about Rosey introducing Dick to her five friends (if you know what I mean) was heard during the *live interview* with the principal!

"I love books, and have actually written four (really bad) novels and have a degree in Literature. But, when I read I don't ""see it in my head"". It's always just been text for me.

I don't have aphantasia, if I try to visualize something I can, but that's not where my mind go. It hasn't taken any joy from reading for me. It also means I'm usually not disappointed by the movie version of a book, since I don't really have a visual in my head of the characters and I'm ok with however they depict it. It does hurt my writing, as I tend to skip over physical descriptions of the characters unless/until something about them is actually relevant to the plot. But I've been told I give really amazing descriptions of sounds and smells. I think some of us just aren't ""visual"" people. But I promise we can still enjoy the world of books."

"I'm blind also. You need to watch Borat with description, if you can stomach it. Having a posh-sounding English guy come up and say things like: ""he's holding a bag of shit"", and ""he grabs the rubber fist and runs out of the room, stark naked."" ... It actually makes the film way more funny."

"She‚Äôs likely less freaked out by you sucking your dick and more freaked out that you‚Äôll see her as a threat and get rid of her. 

We got a new HR person at a place I worked and they made us do sexual harassment training. The lady was hella bad at it and very misinformed, to the point that she told the men that the laws only protect women and they should really consider what they say to women. While we were in the room together as a team, which includes women, the men concluded that you shouldn‚Äôt talk to women in the office and possibly shouldn‚Äôt hire any more. The HR lady suggested the first was a good idea, but the second was TECHNICALLY illegal but that were an at will state. 3 of us women were fired within 2 weeks, the three that were like ‚Äòwtf no laws also protect men‚Äô. 

So yeah, you‚Äôre acting like she‚Äôs got the plague, she‚Äôs likely terrified she‚Äôs losing her job. If she‚Äôs a good employee, see if there‚Äôs any way you can do a job review so it‚Äôs on record that she‚Äôs a good employee. Let her know you‚Äôre not planning to fire her, but that you understand if she needs a reference letter. 

And seriously make sure there‚Äôs no evidence of what happened for gods sake."

"I can't wrap my mind around having aphantasia. I really want to, but like, what happens when you think of something? Literally anything! I always ""see"" what I'm thinking of, in almost every situation. It's how I solve problems and use critical thinking. How do you ""think"" without ""seeing?"" Like if I tell you to think of your house or your apartment, do you not see it in your head? Could you not walk through your entire house in your head, as if you were actually doing so?  If not, what are you thinking of? The idea of your house or apartment?"" Just like ""Hmm yes, I do have a house/apartment."" Is that what it's limited to? If I tell you to think of ""blue,"" do you not see blue? What happens when you daydream? Do you daydream? Are your thoughts limited to abstraction? Could you see even your significant other's face? I really wish I could understand how thought processes work with aphasntasia. It sounds fascinating, but also terrible. I just can't understand even being able to think about something without seeing it in my head."

So what was my fuck up? I was changing the toilet paper roll at work and as I removed the ""axle"" from the empty roll the two halves separated and the spring in the middle flew into the toilet bowl. The picture I had was of said spring in the toilet. It was a fuck up because I didn't have anything to reach in and remove it with and would've had to leave the restroom to get something so I just reached in with my hand and grabbed it.

So what am I supposed to say about that? ""Exasperated by the spring that slowly sank to the depths of the toilet bowl I had to think fast. James Cameron had months to prepare for his trip to the Marianas Trench but I had no such open timetable, nor did I have a deep diving water vessel for the recovery mission."" Hell no. That's dumb."

Sons*
Would this be a wholesome story? Yeah i think so. Its an awedoke story.
"This is similar to my story. I have a son (he is MINE no matter what) where his mother and I had split after an engagement and she had her ‚Äúfun‚Äù for about six months. During that time we tried to reconcile and we were intimate during the time. A few weeks later she calls and says she is pregnant and tells me at the time there is no way he is mine. I go on about my life...kind of. I just so happen to know someone recently pregnant and she has a pregnancy dial that goes of due date and conception. The date she is due shows that she was with me on the exact date. Being a product of a terrible divorce situation I will NEVER let go of my kids. I was there the day he was born, we were married five days later and despite my strong feeling he is not mine....he will ALWAYS be mine. My wife wouldn‚Äôt allow the paternity test in the hospital and I am off of the birth certificate because of her fear. Chances are he is not my making but I have made him the best possible young man he can be and he has made me the best father that I can be. I love him unconditionally and despite my interest in knowing...it doesn‚Äôt matter. I have all of my kids names tattooed on my body and he is the ‚ÄúJohn Hancock‚Äù of them all the largest and the one I am most proud of!  I love him with all that I have. I am sorry your family went through this and you got the outcome you wanted. I sometimes want to do the test but more than anything I just want to be his father and that, I have already done."

"I have no issues with hearing and I love having subtitles always. There are so many things to pick up on with subtitles, like things said under someone's breath or off screen that don't effect the story but build the characters.

"As the mind ages the neuro pathways change, some deepen, some ‚Äúfill in‚Äù. Basically the ole saying ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt use it you lose it‚Äù applies here.
With work you CAN learn to do it again, but that would require you training your mind to do so. (Basically schooling you brain by studying a face, closing your eyes and imagining it, over and over) by doing simple exercises like this you can retrain your brain to do these things. 
It was something that came naturally to you as a child because when your brain is developing its creativity is at its highest, which allows for all sorts of visualizations (ie - why kids have imaginary friends, create games out of nowhere etc etc)."

The odds of finding *one* woman who is such a sex driven nympho such that she gets off on watching a guy suck himself off, is beyond immeasurable.  Finding *multiple* women who are of this quality, such that this scenario:
&gt;She was doing her bachelor party, and instead of hiring the beefcake stripper, her friends wanted to see me suck my own cock.

is possible, would be akin to getting struck by lightening while simultaneously winning consecutive lotteries.

Perhaps this subreddit trends younger, and a lot of you just don't have adult dating/relationship experience.  But, the 'norm' to saying that you can suck yourself off probably isn't, ""Wow, that's hot. I wanna see!""  It would be more akin to, ""That's weird. You actually find that enjoyable?...""

Now *maybe* his story is legit. Maybe he is that one-in-a-billion guy who found a combo of 20-something women who are into watching autofellatio performing almost-40-year old males. However, I would say skepticism is more than warranted here."

Yeah, turns out that was the exact part where the preacher was asking if anyone wants to come up to agree to be baptized. Next thing I know, I'm walking down to the front with my grandpa. He looked so proud of me, I couldn't back out then.

"I can see the news story now:

‚ÄúDoctors around the world are searching for answers as a rash of uniquely similar injuries flood ERs around the globe. Patients are predominantly males aged 14 to 40 all being admitted with light headedness, sprained joints, and bumps on the head from passing out and falling to the ground. The strangest similarities being their various states of undress, the presence of ejaculate on there‚Äôs hands, clothes and even hair, and the overwhelming reluctance to go into details of what happened.

We go to reporter in the field Ben Jakkenit for more, Ben;‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks Herb I‚Äôm here at saint Josephs hospital in downtown Springfield where the patients continue to trickle in with the tell tale signs of this rising epidemic.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow Ben, how are you able to discern which patients are in fact victims of this strange blight?‚Äù

‚ÄúSimple Herb, their parents faces. Especially the moms. There‚Äôs just a immense look of disappointment mixed with embarrassment on all their faces. That and the fact that a large number of them seem to be dazed and humming a popular David Bowie tune as they‚Äôre helped into the hospital. It‚Äôs all very strange.‚Äù

Boobs out there bouncing because I‚Äôm on top. I was so shocked I didn‚Äôt even cover up. He ended up getting grounded. Which I always thought was a weird punishment for having sex.

OP is lucky that the parents kind of accepted him... I had an Asian gf and only the mother knew about it and she wasn't really happy about it, she kept trying to introduce my gf to other Asian man... And the father never knew anything about me! 3 years into the relationship. Now I laugh about it but back then it was not always easy for my ex gf to deal with her parents and feelings."

"When I was 7 or 8, I regularly went swimming in a lake close to my home, and regularly developed otitis.

After a particularly bad one, my parents noticed I was making everyone repeat twice or thrice their sentences and then answering ""yes"" or ""haha"" with a noticeable cluelessness all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

They brought me to the doc and I can still remember couple things :

\- How freaking good it feels to have someone expertly rummage throught your ear, getting all the wax out.

\- Right after he unclogged both my ears, I guenuinely believed they had turned on microphones and speakers were amplifiying every sound in the room.

\- In one ear, he pulled out a wax ball the size of a wasp (might not seem pretty big, but it is impressive when you compare it to the size of a kid's ear canal) that smelled terrible.

* In the same city with cousin he's close with, but doesn't make sure to schedule time to visit with her during his trip, beforehand?


* Very large companies almost never send messengers to hand deliver a single envelope to an individual's office WITHOUT the delivery person having that individual's name. AND she would have no reason to hide her name if her hottie-from-Kik was going to see it on her door, anyways.

"This reminds me of the time I read the book I Am Legend. My fiance had been recommending the book up &amp; down, saying how much he loved it. I had already seen the movie but I love books so figured yeah, let's read this thing! Well unbeknownst to me, the copy he owns is merged with short stories written by the same author. The short stories are at the end of the book, and there are probably 4-5 stories meaning 4-5 extra chapters. There is literally NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE END OF I AM LEGEND AND THE BEGINNING OF THE SHORT STORIES. No ""THE END,"" no title page for the new story about to begin, nothin. So I read the end of I Am Legend, and kept reading thinking the book wasn't over yet. All the short stories were bizarre, one about witches in the woods, one about a guy getting weird phone calls - they were so off topic from I Am Legend that I was confused, but excited that it was somehow going to turn around in some amazing plot twist. By the last page I was so mad - I put it down thinking \*what the holy hell was that\*, a completely unsatisfying feeling when finishing a book. The whole reading experience was tainted and I don't think I have gotten over it yet, haha. I really wish I had gotten to enjoy that book for what it is!"

"that is an awesome hilariously story.

anyways,  here is an idea of how to play it, and also do a pro revenge type thing.

- to your boss ask to have a moment to speak privately,  and tell the whole truth.  This person was your ex gf,  she didn't recognize me, I thought she was being a bitch to me and kinda played along.  And then I realized she really didn't recognize me.   she was my girlfriend, she cruelly dumped me, she broke my heart, she destroyed me.  

And now I see that I really meant so little to her that she really does not recognize me,  so I got really pissed off and played the part.  
But  boss, please don't say anything to her or do anything for me.  I don't know what to do, but I'll try to figure it out.  I don't want a confrontation or to damage working here. 

When she dumped me she said I was fat, ugly, and had the most annoying voice in the world.  Crikey,  how can she not recognize my voice as the most annoying voice in the world.  (gets your eyes teared up here,  maybe pull a nose hair out discretely).

"Is there a surefire way to know if you have aphantasia? I'll try to put my question in the simplest terms.

&amp;#x200B;

If you do not have aphantasia, are you able to imagine an apple right in front of you? Like, it has all qualities of an apple, excluding touch and smell, of course(similar to a hologram or vr, or maybe a construction game like the sims or bridge connector)? or is it just a thought, in a way? Similar to that of the voice you use in your head? Is it like, a think you think of and can describe, but can't see? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just asking this cause I *think* I might have aphantasia. I'm just confused, to be honest, cause all I think of when I try to imagine an apple is what defines an apple, and how it acts. I can think of how fast it would slide down a slope and how many pieces it can explode into, but not how it rolls or the specific fissures that appear when it hits the ground. I'm just confused tbh. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I've been rambling, and just being young and dumb. Any description and definition of ""imagine"" would be greatly appreciated. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Is imagining something similar to that of seeing in a VR headset? Or is it just a thought, similar to that of speaking in your mind?"

But now, his whole life has been for nothing. There is no homo‚Ä¶ there is only Ardipithecus."
You can see in Monet's work he developed cataracts as he got older and it got pretty bad

"I've done this almost everytime I've had sex. My mind just goes everywhere else but what's happening. It's gotten so bad that I just avoid sex entirely now. But next time I'm definitely going to shout ""BOP IT"" and see if thing improve"
"This is how you raise kids with relationship issues. Good job, OPs and OPs GF's parents."
Pretty much every modern OS has accessibility features like dictation and voice commands.
"It's not just this subreddit.  Reddit seems to have been taken over by young teens trying out copying stories already posted and some form of social outrage.  While I don't mind a well written story, the OPs insist these stories actually happened to them when you point out the holes in their tale"
"Lots of tough guys responding, but do you really want to go to prison to prove a point?  

Your wife would then be married to a murderer that killed her brother.  There is no coming back from that.

The husband did the right thing if you factor in all the effects that a murder would have."
"Oh my God that's fucking great. To be fair though, you couldn't have possibly known that shit. Great story. Upvote deserved."
"pfft, chair? I'd let Satan warm up my face by putting his thicc as on it"
"Nothing. You're aware of how everything looks, what characters are doing etc but you can't see them. You might be able to summon up a very rough visual image of the basic thing, but it takes a lot of focus and as soon  as you read the next attribute you lose the last. When i say rough by the way, I mean rough. 

&amp;#x200B;

If the text describes a man as 6 feet tall with brown hair and a scar on his cheek I can kinda picture a rough outline of a person, like a thin pale white line on a black background, no detail. As soon as i read the words ""with brown hair"" it's the same pale white outline of the top of someones forehead. The hair i can't picture as brown is too dark - if the text said blonde then the forehead outline would have a yellowish blob on top, no hair texture or definitive shape. As soon as I read ""scar on his cheek"" it's kind of the same thing  outline of the bottom quarter of a face with a random line somewhere in it as the scar. The image kinda ""flickers"" as well, maybe 5-6 times over about 2 seconds, then disappears.

&amp;#x200B;

The worst part is measurement. Because I can only form the most basic of shape for probably less than a second at a time, distances are pretty irrelevant. When I read Game of Thrones i knew The Mountain was a giant, wealds a greatsword one handed etc but as I can't picture him and someone else at the same time, all I get is 'man has sword'. The wall simply was not impressive to me in the same way until I saw book-accurate artwork because all I could see is a rough white rectangle. I could still appreciate the sheer scale of the thing, but I never saw it until I was on awoiaf.

&amp;#x200B;

I would say you experience the story the same way you learn a language or remember multiplications, but I have no idea if other people actually see the letters/words and the numbers when doing those things.

&amp;#x200B;

It's hard to explain, but that's about as well as I can describe it."
Not quite how the story went
"OP, are you male or female? As a dude who also grew up with ultra religious parents, it would have been a WAY bigger deal if my sister had been in on any antics like this than if it were my brother."
Holy shit. Recognized by the man himself! Thank you General!
Well I just now learned that people can literally see things in their mind. Reddit just taught me that I probably have aphantasia.
"How many years did it take to obtain this skill? You know, for scientific purposes..."
wrong
"No... clearly, zoop"
"Slowly loose the accent while wistfully thinking about vegemite on toast with butter but settling for marmite because it's all you can get in this town and no one cares anymore about how cool the accent was when you first moved here because it's all about results and you never even have the oppertunity to catch any wildlife or show off your skills tossing the 'rang around, you have bills to pay."
Me too. Hi guys.
"Could be worse, try falling asleep in the middle of receiving a BJ."
"In all seriousness this is the good thing to do. She's likely going to be quite troubled by the sudden disappearance and the receptionist telling her that the guy came by. She'll possibly think he saw her and thought she was ugly and ran or something along those line. Or she'll connect the dots anyway, but it's so far-fetched that she may not realize it.  


Plus if they're close they can just be embarrassed about it for a little while and then laugh about it. If they're the kind of people who are fine posting nudes on the internet I can't imagine it would take long to get over knowing that your cousin has seen you in such a fashion."

"#**kind of like when you're with a real estate agent looking at a house for sale that's still being lived in, and the owners are away, but then the little door under the stairs creaks open a bit and you see the deformed child that they keep under there to hide him away, he stares at you unblinking for a few moments, then creaks it shut again and nobody ever mentions it**"
Hell yeah!!!

"As crude as it sounds... the one part you mentioned about ""not being able to imagine a purdy woman to choke the chicken"" or however you phrased it may be the best way to determine if someone has aphantasia or not. 

Like, when I was younger I used to always play out certain erotic scenes in my head whenever I didn't have access to porn and I wanted to jerk it (like in the shower or something).

If you've never or literally can't do this then you may have this condition, I guess. But this is also my first time hearing about it at all so... TIL."
"Not too often. It was so traumatic at the time that it's still a sore spot for my hubs. I'm usually the one cracking the jokes about it. It's water under the bridge, can't change it now"

"I've learned Thai massage myself, and have given quite a lot since then. Sometimes it just happens, man. There's some presses on the thighs, and when the dick happens to be on that side, it's possibly going to be accidentally touched.

I was once massaging a client on a festival, accidentally brushed his dick when pressing on his thigh. In the next move I had to put lift his knee, and when I did, through the hose of his pants there was one-eye staring at me. I was shocked for a tiny moment, but then just forgot about it and focused on the massage again."

Send the wife a heartfelt apology. Then give her evidence of your relationship with Derrick so that he gets screwed in the divorce.
