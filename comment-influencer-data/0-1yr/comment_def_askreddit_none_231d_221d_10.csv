"I agree we should never laugh at things like this. But, not to sound like a bitch but if you’re being paid to do something, and instead you just eat and sleep, disrupt others and don’t keep up with hygiene, you should def expect to be let go..I get he may need help, but it’s not the work or his coworkers responsibility "
"My theory is most people assess another person by searching for flaws. The first step is to search the face. They're looking for things that are messy, disorderly, out of place. The less they find, the more attractive they'll consider the person, at least initially. 

There's a lot of small ""chaos"" on a face that are often ignored but can be improved on over time. Disregard permanent features, like jaw structure or eye placement, some with temporary issues like a single zit or recent sore that will heal. Find the things between those that can be addressed over time. 

Dry, flaking skin? Drink more water and use lotion. Chapped lips? Water and chapstick. Stray eyebrow hairs/unibrow? Tweezers. Dandruff? WATER, and shower with a dandruff shampoo daily. Yellow teeth? Whitening strips, toothpaste  mouthwash. Greasy hair? Stop skipping showers, don't eat greasy foods. Big pours, blackheads, puffy hair, fly-aways, the list goes on. Google the issue and see what remedies people suggest. 

Easier said than done, I know, but it can give a standard to shoot for and over time you really do see huge improvements. Pretend you're going to have a high def picture taken of your face and posted online and target things that will show up. Check out pictures of Matthew Lewis or Aaron Taylor-johnson over time. No plastic surgery or change in facial structure. Just tidying up the face, healthy skin, and a good haircut. You don't need to be skinny either, look at how polished James Corden is as an example.
