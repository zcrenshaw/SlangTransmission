"We found my friends moms dildos (quite extensive collection) and we chased each other around his house with them.  I think we were 12/13 and there was about 5-6 of us.  The game stopped when one touched someone‚Äôs mouth.

Block the keyhole with a photo of Bran staring.
He actually did it
We were about 16-17 and found my friends moms vibrator. Someone dropped it and it broke so the son was scared he would get caught snooping in his moms room so he took it to the garage and fixed it. So we nicknamed the garage the dildo repair shop and called it that for the rest of high school
Just blocking keyhole would be good. He wouldn't know if you or she did it and he would shit himself.
I think this is the best. Your girlfriend says loudly she's going to go shower. You sneak in and just start wanking furiously whilst looking at the hole. He'll never look through again
"This is impressive. Similar story, my sister had always been obsessed with getting the best TV resolution possible, always getting the latest thing. At 28 she finally went to an optometrist who determined she actually has terrible vision. When I asked, she said she just thought everything was kind of blurry for everyone."

Don't judge her based on her family. The fact that she would have that occasional giggle in front of her family with them knowing what she was laughing at says she's a keeper.
Got to say bravo that is hilarious. Also gf is a true diamond for seeing the funny side.

I agree with you. We‚Äôve actually been together for a long time and have laughs about her family. She is the woman for me!
I‚Äôm a woman of my word.
lol He wears clothes now. My wife made sure to talk to him about penises and vaginas and I had to excuse myself to go laugh my ass off. I‚Äôm a grown ass man but every time my wife or my son said penis and/or vagina I lost it.

.....aaaand this is why you create a throwaway account.
"I had a friend like that too.

He was a couple of years younger than me and was getting ready to start learning to drive. We got talking about what the test involved, and I mentioned there was a sight test. I told him you had to read the license plate of a car from a certain distance. 

I pointed at a car across the road, just to show him how easy it was and not a big deal. He squinted at it for a moment and then asked 'what, that one? Right over there? How are you supposed to read that?'

Turned out, he had really bad distance vision and hadn't ever realised."

Sounds exactly like the kind of excuse a public masturbator would use.
"I did the exact same thing for years.  


I always bought the same lavender smelling 'detergent'(actually softener)


I loved the way my clothes smelled, but they weren't always clean.  I always thought I had a shitty washing machine and never gave it anymore thought.  


This lasted for years, until I got married.  The first time my wife was doing the laundry she asked me where the detergent was.  I said 'babe - its right by the machine', she like 'I dont see it'.  I go over there and point it out to her.  She started laughing....and laughing...and laughing.   


To this day, she still makes fun of me anytime she remembers about it."
I mean you could just go buy steak and whiskey and try it yourself. It's not like you're blowing up a car or something lol
Soon does he wear clothes now? Also him thinking that's how there are girls will f*** him up real good in the future!

"My grade 8 classmates (all boys) and I found a pink dildo under one of our hotel beds when we were on a field trip. Half of us were so confused, the other half of us thought it was hysterical, a giant 12 inch neon pink penis isn‚Äôt something you always find under a bed. I remember we chased each other with it, even slapped each other in the face with it when the other person wasn‚Äôt looking.. Looking back, who knows where that thing had been.

We kept this thing in our hotel for two days until we finally told our teacher, which ended up getting us a free room for the night. I still laugh when I think about it to this day."

"Eye doctor here.  Women who have color deficiencies are fully genetic genotype (X)(X) where the parentheses indicate the color deficiency gene.  This means that one of two circumstances must be present:

Dad is (X)Y Mom is (X)(X) - 100% of daughters possible are Expressing color deficiency

I‚Äôll tell you a funny story of a male teenage boy in my office one day.  Most of family was in my exam room, including Mom, Daughter, teenage son (not the patient), younger Son (patient).  During the examination of the younger son, I determined he was color deficient, severely so in fact.  Older brother bursts out in laughter, mocking him at his new diagnosis.

I stop the exam there, look at the brother square in the eye and say ‚ÄúThis is Genetic.  And by the way, your pants are green, not brown.‚Äù  He looks back at me incredulous and says, ‚ÄúShut up, they‚Äôre brown!‚Äù

The family burst out in laughter, apparently they just thought he had funky fashion sense.  The pants were green."
Don't put yourself down. We all enjoyed that picture.
"When i got my learners permit to learn to drive i had to get an eye test (everyone does) so I walk in thinking it'll be fine, I've never had any vision problems, optometrist asks me if I ever had any problems, i said no, they do the tests and then turn to me and say ""the only thing normal is your colour vision"".

Turns out 3D movies are not supposed to give you a headache or make you dizzy.

Turns out you are supposed to be able to read things more than 5' away.

Turns out you are not supposed to get double vision after a long day.

Turns out you are not meant to have extremely blurry vision after you wake up.

Turns out your eyes are not meant to be sore after a long day.

Turns out things are not meant to jump left or right if you close one eye.

Turns out my mother also needed glasses."

"Holy shit (hehe), that was wild.

Now you've tried it once though, I strongly advise you to not do it again. Enemas don't do anything for you, unless you are severely constipated or something. By using an enema you can actually flush good bacteria out of your body, which can lead to other awful things like maybe IBS (as an IBS sufferer myself, you don't want it. Trust me.).

Also, it doesn't cleanse your body. There is nothing harmful to cleanse. Your liver and kidneys do all that work for you already. Don't fall for the 'health scam' again.

Not trying to be annoying, just wanna raise awareness against these unhealthy 'detox' methods. Be safe :)"

"THANK YOU!  OP I know it sucks to realize your dad is a pervy fuck who jumped on an opportunity to violate your girlfriend‚Äôs privacy but he *violated your girlfriend‚Äôs privacy*.  Intentionally, repeatedly, and as soon as she was vulnerable.  That is the type of man he is.  It‚Äôs on you to a) do something about it, b) protect your girlfriend from further violation by telling her what you saw so that she never fools herself by thinking she‚Äôs safe around your father‚Äîshe‚Äôs not, and c) extrapolating this shitty revelation into the realization that sexual assaults and other forms of violations are committed by all kinds of people, in all kinds of brazen ways.  You have to tell her OP."

I'm just laughing at the idea of your husband taking so many toys into the kitchen that he forgot one and didn't notice. In my head it's just like armloads of dildos.

"The only way you have fucked up here is by framing standing up for your wife as losing money. You absolutely did the right thing.

I've had money, and I've had a wife, both are gone now and I have never gone to bed missing the money."
"Alright, let me.get this straight. Please, correct me wherever I say something that's wrong.

Y'all spent Friday night together, as well as the day, I presume. Y'all spent both Saturday and Sunday night together, as well as both days. You also repeatedly say ""We got home"", rather than ""we came back to my place"" or ""came.back to his place"". You always refer to it as a home, and that you both come back to it.

I mean, you may not wanna define it, but I'm willing to bet my paycheck for tomorrow that you know good and well what you want to define it as.

Trust me, if the man is meat whiskey drunk at work, and his first thought is to video call you so he can tell your pretty face that it's pretty and to not eat the meat whiskey because you could die, the man cares about ya. Bring it up to him, and thank me after y'all share the second meat whiskey together"

An actual conversation I heard at church a few weeks ago.

Our church has a trans woman who is hilariously open about herself (sometimes to an unnerving degree, although she's open about ALL her medical issues so you're as likely to hear her complain about a recent colonoscopy as you are to hear how her breast implant is trying to escape.) and we have a wee congregation member who has recently learned the names of body parts.

I think her mom was the most upset, she kept stammering and we finally managed to piece together that she tried to explain what a sex change operation was and that ""Eve"" had one. Which resulted in the kid thinking Eve has a dick. She does not, trust me. I heard all about it when it was remodeled."
"You'll have to post the rest of the convo including accidental photo.
10% of it doesn't quite cut the mustard if you want us to fully understand your mortification."
Whatever lies taste like.
"Not even. I just didn't have reason to question it. In fact when I learned that snorting things do in fact have a faster effect on the brain it made even more sense. And I was in a situation growing up where I had to be pretty independent so I never had to ask or be supervised when it came to taking medication. For the most part I knew what I was doing, except apparently Goodies.

And like I may have mentioned already, the shit taste like hell, I'm still not comfortable consuming it orally so I just stick to Excedrin and Tylenol for headaches."

"The only fuck up you did today was not calling out your Dad. I guarantee he's done this before. He knows about the hole, he knows about how the hole can be utilized, and he has a cover action (hoovering) developed."
"Can confirm, been a nosy fucker myself at this age.."
Shits so dumb lol
"The fact that he was hoovering at that time despite no need, moved off as she left the bathroom and from the sounds of it hung around for a while is an awful lot of coincidences.

If you look at it from another perspective, he purposely went there knowing she was in the shower, thought enough about it to cover it up with the hoover and hung around shows quite a lot of premeditation. 

It doesn't sound like he accidentally came into the opportunity and was to weak willed not to look.

I am trying not project here but let me just say that I ignored warning signs with my father 'he isn't that sort of person' 'he is just a harmless old man' 'things were different when he was younger' and well, let's just say, he wasn't just a harmless old man.

Not saying that's the case here, but that is definitely really very concerning. I would tell your girlfriend and ask how she wants to handle it, after all it was her that was potentially violated. Doubt she would be happy if this came out later."

"If I may jump in w/ a PSA. *Please* teach your children anatomically correct terminology included vulva/vagina and penis. AAP has been recommending this for at least a decade, probably longer, and repeated studies are showing that there is a reduced incidence of sexual assault among children who use anatomical vocabulary versus other made up words.  

*Furthermore, children who lack sexual knowledge may be more
vulnerable to sexual abuse. Some sexual offenders avoid children who know the correct names
for their genitals because this suggests these children have been educated about body safety and
sexuality (Elliot, Browne, &amp; Kilcoyne, 1995). One convicted offender (who had assaulted 75
children by the time he was stopped) reported that when children knew the correct terms for their
different body parts, he would leave them alone (Sprengelmeyer &amp; Vaughan, 2000).*

"We didn't find out that my son was colorblind until he was 18. He had a really outgoing personality so everyone assumed that the hot pink and orange shirts and crazy patterns were just him being extra. I always found it unusual because nobody else in the family likes loud colors and so his taste was unusual. Once we found out he was colorblind everything made so much sense.  


A few years ago he stopped in to surprise us by making us dinner. Steak and trout with sweet potatoes. He and I shared a steak. Now my kid was notorious for being terrible at steak. He could cook anything else like a trained chef, but he just sucked at steak. He served it beyond rare. Practically raw. Sometimes still cold and with zero sear.  


This time he was poking at his half of the one he was sharing with me. He frowned and shook his head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why this turned out so well done. I didn‚Äôt think I overcooked it.‚Äù  


I lifted an eyebrow. ‚ÄúThis is medium rare. For once, it‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù  


‚ÄúMedium rare! Mom! This is well done! There‚Äôs absolutely no pink in here at all!‚Äù  


I looked at my steak with bewilderment as the red juices flowed onto the plate.  


Then I shouted, ‚ÄúJames! You‚Äôre colorblind! Remember?!‚Äù  


You should‚Äôve seen the look on his face as years of steak arguments clicked into place. He let out a soft, ‚ÄúOoooOOOooh...!‚Äù  


And that's the story about why my son bought a meat thermometer."

"This is the correct answer, as far as I‚Äôm concerned. 

Fill the hole with something that will make dad shit himself when he sees it. Maybe get a naked photo of yourself, with the junk clearly visible, and use that.

Dad will be absolutely wrecked, knowing you‚Äôre onto his creepshow and realizing you‚Äôve outsmarted him. Forcing him to see his fully-grown son in the nude is just an added bonus; that mental scar will never fully heal."
"Sure, but you could have been getting changed or something."

In fact it is the main reason she enjoys celery.
