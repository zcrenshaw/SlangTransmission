"Mostly good.

Business wise we're in a sort of strange no-man's land between good enough and not good enough. We earn more than enough to live comfortably in Mexico but quite a bit less than where we'd projected we'd be at this point. 

So we're doing great in terms of living a good life but not so great in terms of traditional business metrics given the size of our investment, both monetarily and the work we've put in.

We have no complaints. I'm just answering the question honestly :)"
"Wow, that was fast. My favorite bond I have to say which surprises some is Timothy Dalton since I felt his personality is more drawn to Bonds personality in the books, favorite bond movie though would be The Spy Who Loved Me because of the large set pieces, action pieces, and of course Jaws! He's the bloody best.

As for ever meeting Pierce in person, I have not since he was always so in tune and intertwine with Martin and the choreographers and while a few cheeky extras did try to go up and talk to him, he was still humble and approachable but was always too busy to have a conversation longer than 60 seconds. "
Favorite Bond movie and Actor? Did you meet Pierce?
"I am the bloody best at procrastinating, but I do enough work to earn that coin."
"Yeah.

I'll often get emails or messages that read something along the lines of, ""Hey, help me convince my husband/wife/bf/gf to come!""

And my answer is always, ""Nope.""

Haha.

The truth is, as irrational as that fear is, if it's going to prevent you from having a good time then why not go somewhere that you will feel comfortable?

I mean, I personally think it's important to push your own boundaries but trying to push someone else's is a recipe for disaster."
Were any of the soldiers in the N64 game modeled after you?
Yeah that’s gonna be a no from me dawg
Do you consider yourself a good or bad manager?

Welcome to Sweden!
"So funny thing is that my 'character' was killed, resurrected and killed again in the archives. The first one he was killed when all those barrels came crashing down and promptly the building exploding later in the scene. (The barrels that fell were made of rubber by the way, my son always thought it was real metal and they just had stuntmen at the bottom.) And in the archives I was the soldier on the right that bond shoots at below on the second jump take from the first salvo of rounds he fires at the previous troops."
"Being dope sick and going to a jail a bunch sucked, but when my mom would cry because she thought I would die all the time.  I just got sick of it. "
"Since I fit the initial description of having a ponytail and a beard, I was arrested by the police while riding a bicycle near my home. Later that day they took me to hospital where doctors take dna tests. By some mistake of the police, victim was also present at the hospital before my identification process. She saw me shackled and surrounded by the police officers and started screaming what an asshole I am, that she'd spit on my face if she could and similar things until police officers took her away. So that let me to assume that she was the victim."
Can’t say I’m sure he didn’t 
"Nor friends, nor family believed that I could have done something like this (or at least didn't told me that). Tho most of them were appalled that it is possible to put someone in jail without any real evidence."
"In the opening scene of Goldeneye, a man is seen reading a newspaper that says 1995 on it even though the movie took place in 1986!

I certainly hope someone got fired for that blunder!"
"No, saw her first time in my life at hospital, where they took my dna. Her name was not familiar to me either."
Was it a USB-C?
Honestly I'm struggling a bit with my own depression but I'm doing my best. 
I mistook my mother's mental illness as a side effect of the Marijuana so I had an extremely negative image of those who used it. 
"Yes, definitely. I will give a little backstory (I am afraid some would think I was trolling). I really liked this guy who would come and visit me at work. I had been single for a while and was definitely ready to go out with someone new, so when he asked me out I was so excited! We went on a few dates and then he asked me to his friends' wedding. Which was cool because I hadn't met a lot of his friends! That being said, I was still a little nervous. Actually, more than a ""little"". I started the day with a hearty breakfast and then I decided to have a mimosa. So, that had me feelin' good! So when I went over to my guys house to get ready for the wedding, I suggested we have some drinks. Big mistake. We did probably about 10 shots apiece of whiskey. I don't remember anything after that except bits and pieces. I was beyond mortified. Haven't drank since. Now with the ""arrest"" that was a little bit of an exaggeration, I was told that the parents of the bride were so pissed at my behavior that they called the cops. The cops, seeing how piss drunk I was, handcuffed me and put me in the backseat of the car until I agreed to ""behave"". After the cops left, my guy told me that's when I shit. The peeing happened a little more incognito. "

"Wow. I remember your previous ama.  The place looks great.  I did my very best to convince my wife to go there but she’s absolutely convinced we will be killed by drug traffickers.  

"
"If I can remember 20 years ago how filming went, we filmed about over 20 different clips of angles the cinematographers felt would be the best in the scene at the gas tanks. It lasted about 2 days filming there with longest day being 16 hours. Each time they have these shots go, they would sometimes even rearrange us in different spots trying to get the best shot."
So for the 2 or 3 days of filming on the gunfight in the interior of the chemical plant I made around 150 pounds and filming at the archives came to 200 pounds since it took much longer to shoot there then the chemical plant as that had more stunts and blanks to be fired as well as your close ups.
As someone who is struggling with PTSD myself can I just say thank you on behalf of all that you do. My partner is put through hell with all of the things I am going through. Make sure you are seeing/talking to someone as well. Your mental health matters as well. 
Is it a first or second cousin? 
Did you know the victim before this experience? 
"Am a millennial “young professional” with disposable income in the tech sector and I agree wholeheartedly that the website needs a redo. I’ve read your other posts and you say you’re fine with where you are which is the most important thing, but I just wanted to let you know my impressions based on the website.

The first and biggest thing is “book by email.” I’m sorry what? It’s 2018. I literally don’t want to talk to anyone if I don’t need to. I can book every other hotel with a few clicks and get a confirmation while I’m sitting at a bar waiting for friends to come join me (for example). I could send you an email in the same situation too, but unless you’re going to reply to me immediately/less than a minute then you’ve lost me as a customer. Call it being not patient, and maybe you’d think “fine I don’t want someone who couldn’t wait a few hours to get a response because they’d be really difficult customers anyway” but it’s really not like that. I just don’t want to leave things “open” you know? I want to just fill out my details and book it and know that I’m done with it. I don’t want to wait for a response about whether or not the you have availability and do a back and forth.

There’s also this part about paying:

&gt;	We recommend that payments are made via bank transfer. We do accept credit card payments, but surcharges apply.

First of all, what the f is a “bank transfer?” I’m being facetious of course because I understand the words and the concept, but I have never once in my life ever done one and I have no idea how I’d even do one, and even if I did, I would never do one to something like this. Maybe I’d need to do one if/when I buy property, but never in a million years would I transfer money to some random person (which you are, because presumably I’ve found your resort by google) because to me it just screams **SCAM SCAM SCAM**. The other thing is you mention a credit card surcharge but you don’t tell me how much it is. Again, this is 2018. Information is literally at my fingertips. Why can’t I find this information on your website? It all sounds so scammy.

Here’s what I would do: adjust the pricing to include the surcharge without mentioning it. Change the wording to ”We accept payments via MasterCard and Visa (and Amex). We also accept payments via bank transfer and will offer an X% discount.”

Smarter people will know what you did here. Your regular customers who presumably pay by bank transfer won’t be affected. New customers will see a “normal” price and not think anything of it. Everyone else will think “A discount? HELL YES.” You gotta understand that people will run away from added fees, but will gladly embrace discounts even if the price was raised.

My two other comments regarding the website: 

1) You gotta make the website modern looking. This looks like a website designed by my dad for his friends. Maybe you’re after the 50+ year old crowd, but many people judge books by the cover for better or for worse. The thiNg i dont get is that you have a beautiful logo with a beautiful color scheme … but you dont make use of it. Even just adding some orange and yellow accents to match the logo would be great.

Hire a professional photographer or hell even a 3rd/4th year photography student.

Take http://geckorockresort.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/dream-location.jpg for example. This one just looks terrible. It’s too dark. Too much shadow. It’s not properly framed. The palm leaves cutting into the picture in the top right.

Or this one: http://geckorockresort.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/fishingaction.jpg. I think you’re trying to say “look how happy she is staying here doing fun activities” but because of how zoomed up you are and how you’ve cropped it, it looks like it’s fake and it’s hard to tell anything without being able to see the surrounding. Is she suppose to be on a boat? Why not show the boat too then?

Or this one: http://geckorockresort.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Discovery-Dive-2.jpg. Every other picture I’ve seen of people having fun diving … is blue. This one is green. 

Or how about the food? You say awe inspiring food, but then you show me this: http://geckorockresort.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/tacos-mexico-beach-resort.jpg. What  I looking at? That doesn’t look awe inspiring at all. That looks like a white person’s idea of Mexican food. Seriously, compare it to this: https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5745c59352bcd044008c50d7-750-563.jpg which is what came up when I searched for “Mexico City tacos.” The difference is the latter looks god damn amazing and I could see myself ordering like 10 of those. Yours? Eh, I’ll try it if it’s free but it looks like you just bought canned tomatoes."

The location is perfect... The hosts are wonderful and the food is outstanding.  (Mike makes a mean margarita too)

We will go back soon...  Wish it was now.

"Have you or your husband heard of these amazing results in treating people with ptsd with Mdma?

There was a 70% success rate in relieving and even curing symptoms of Ptsd after just one guided session using Mdma.

I´ve overcome Ptsd myself by using Mdma in a time where I just saw it as a possibility to have a shortlived good time and got blown away by the longlasting positive effects.

Had to do so on my own since Mdma guided psychotherapy isn´t available in my country, Germany, atm."

"While I was in custody, at first I thought that this is some messed up reality show, after few hours I was hoping everything will clear out and I will be able to go home, but when they put me in jail after a few days I began to feel really scared, especially after listening to some of the other inmates stories. Even to this day I still feel scared when I see police or even security personnel nearby."

"They had only met a few times when he broke up with me. After spending three weeks with her in another country he came home and said that he didn’t love me anymore, but couldn’t give me any explanation. It came from nowhere. One year later he wrote to me to clear his conscience and said that the reason why he broke up with me was because he fell in love with his cousin. "
"Some people describe their orientation as ""Heteroromantic bisexual"", meaning they may enjoy some types of homosexual play, but could only fall in love with someone of the opposite sex. They often don't even want to know the people they have the homosexual encounters with.

"I absolutely agree. Your website offers “easy booking ... just email us” but no one books by email anymore. You need online booking, better photos, you need to get on Instagram, show pics of the food that’s included, sample menus, etc.

"AFAIK the rooms are brainstormed and designed by the creative geniuses at the ""corporate"" level, who design and test-run the rooms many many many times before they're pushed out to the other locations.  


That being said, if an aspect of the room breaks or proves too difficult for players on a local level, we were allowed to modify or re-design clues and puzzles, and we did that all of the time. Some of the things we came up with ended up being really clever, in the context of the room, and we sent our suggestions up the chain. "
That is a great response.  Shit man. I might head down myself just to sit around and chat for a few days.  
What will you do now? Now that you have reached this level of success where do you see yourself going next? 
"Poor marketing.

Just not enough people know we exist yet.

I don't think that there's anything wrong with our message. Meaning that we're happy with how our website and reviews portray our product.

We'll get there and we're not worried but ideally we'd book about double the number of nights as we did last year, for example.

To be fair, we're also stubborn and refuse to pay 15-20% commissions to sites like Expedia, Hotels.com, etc. So slow growth is also due to our unwillingness to fork over the dough and play the game."
What was your motivation for change?
"I can't say for sure, with the different methods of execution for escape rooms. I will say that anyone who runs an escape room business on a local or corporate level needs to know that unless they are located in a city with tons of tourists or in a huge, pristine location, rooms need to be retired and rotated out with new, fresh ideas after about 8 months of running. My location kept the same 4 rooms the entire time I was there, and in the last few months I actively worked there, there was such a significant drop in attendance because everyone local had played all of the rooms we had. There was no more appeal to the place. "
"No offense, but if there was a personalized version of hell for me, it would me at the supermarket with 5 kids under 5. How do you have the patience?"

"From the other inmates I gathered, that it is better to be a murderer in prison, rather than rapist."
"Not in my experience. My location where I worked offered multiple styles of rooms to choose from, and in at least one of those rooms, players start out in handcuffs and blindfolds. They cannot move freely around the room while they are cuffed, but there's a safety release mechanism so that if they pull hard enough in an emergency, they can get out of the room.  


Sometimes players would express not being comfortable with one or both of those components, so basically what we tell them is to hold on to the cuffs *as if* they are cuffed, and not let go of the cuffs until they find the key. The blindfolds are also optional, they just add to the immersion of the room.  


The doors to the rooms also never actually locked for fire safety purposes, so anyone who was scared about being locked in had nothing to worry about. The only incidents I ever remember were:  


\&gt; a woman in one of my groups was claustrophobic, and since there were no other players in the building during their game, I offered to leave the door open for their group. That deal worked out fine and no one was shitty about it.  


\&gt; a man with PTSD/Anxiety was on the edge about being handcuffed. I never pressured him into putting them on, but eventually he agreed that it would be okay, so I put them on him. About 4 minutes into the game, he asked me to come in and unlock his cuffs. I happily obliged, and again, no one was shitty about it."
"Honestly, having customers here who don't want to be here sounds like a fucking nightmare.

Our setup is very different and we have a very intimate (not that kind) relationship with most of our customers. We spend a lot of time together and so if people are here for a week and hate it, then I'm going to hate it, too.

When we first opened and were desperate to get the ball rolling my father kept asking me for advice on how to sell our place to people aren't really ""beach"" people...and I said, ""Don't."" It does no good for our reputation to have people come who then leave having wished they'd done something else.

"My mother is a missing person. At one point, a woman from NAMUS contacted me and we were trying to work together to get bones from the sheriff's dept. where it happened. Unfortunately, the whole thing went nowhere and the case dropped back into obscurity for a while.

Is there a way that I can find out what she found out? She has left since and they said she took her notes with her. Is that even legal? I mean, don't you have access to information that others don't?

WHAT!? Isn't that illegal in most states?
What was the pay like?
"Wow. The proper answer to this question requires alcohol and far more verbiage than I've got time to type out.

Yes and no.

Mostly no but enough yes to be happy with our choice.

And every season the pendulum swings more towards yes.

What we love about the lifestyle is that we have the opportunity to work very hard part of the year and then take part of the year off. We love the freedom to turn down bookings if we want a break. The freedom to open later in the season if we want to. The freedom to block off a week for whatever reason we want.

We love (mostly) being in control of our destiny.

But the actual day-to-day grind when we have customers is exhausting. It's hard work and many people think we're just chilling by the pool drinking Margaritas when that's what the GUESTS are doing.

There are moments when we look at our place, which is also our home, and we think, ""Holy fucking shit. I can't believe this is our life...and that we built this."" And other days we fantasize about having 9-5 jobs with a paycheck and a weekend.

The grass is always greener is still true, even when you're doing something really cool - and that's been an interesting aspect of this process. But every year we're getting better at figuring out how to enjoy it more. "

"At times it could get real boring, a lot of sitting around and waiting can happen while rehearsals can also take a majority of time, even deciding who gets the blank guns and who gets the rubber guns. I always wanted the rubber gun cause that meant you would get shot and would have to die on screen which means a chance of getting to see it on film. I got one of those scenes on film in the archives portion."
"Went through this same shit. Seeing her get to point where every time she’d see me in person, her facial demeanor looked like she’d already lost me. Seeing her months after I got clean and seeing her face light up that “I” was back was one of the best feelings ever.

EDIT:  to anyone reading this, having your mom accept that their child is going to die from drugs is one of the worst things you can do to a mother. I’m not saying don’t do drugs, but please use them safely and use in GREAT moderation. I thought I was invincible and immune to addiction before it tore my life apart. It happens easier and quicker than you think ."
"My mum first asked me if I was gonna be the main villain which I told her no but I would technically be one of the bad guys, and I  promised her she will see me at least once.

"They usually don't because you can't have an extra get shot up and throw a 800£ gun on the floor through like 3 or 4 takes. I don't know how most blank guns were made, but these I know can be a little fragile so the prop department made sure that all the AKs would take little damage as possible. Even after cutting a scene, the prop department lads would take all the blank guns from the extras, dismantle them and clean them and even load the blanks themselves. They did a good job making it look like that all the guns were being fired with full auto though in the movie cause in reality the clips were only loaded with like 3 or 4 blanks and we were told to shoot at an interval to make it look like it was going off in an automatic fashion. Only person that got to fire off the guns in full auto with about 20 blanks in the clip was of course the main actor."

It was very helpful to me to smoke with someone I trusted and who I knew would take care of me if something happened (nothing ever did of course but it was a fear of mine) it was also really helpful that he was knowledgeable about it so he explained what I would expect to feel. Start slow.

I remember my mum crying lots and she told me that my dad ""had gone to London for his new job"" I believed this but she eventually told me the truth because we would be visiting my dad In prison."
"Hell yeah! And yesssss! I cried to them lol It is a running joke to them and their family now. They're cool AF and in an odd way, it brought us all closer together even though I would absolutely stop that from happening if I had a time- machine."

SWEET HOME ALABAMA
Have you considered making a virus that subs to pewds?
My fiance was suffering from ptsd and after a lot of research we came to an agreement where he could use it to help with his panic attacks under very strict circumstances (the fact that it could be obtained legally had a big impact on my choice as well). I also suffered from depression and anxiety and I recall having a particularly bad day and I told my fiance that I wanted to try it and he eased me into it and was very supportive and answered all of my questions. I had what must have been annoying level of questions 
He was looking for attention. Don’t give him any. His guilty conscience is not your problem when he chose to leave you. Fuck that guy. I hope you find someone who treats you well and doesn’t want create inbred babies!

"Most of them *need* to be in the maximum-security block and off the streets, as a lot of them are serial killers who proudly flaunt their heinous acts against others without the slightest ounce of remorse. And according to the legal system, they're not innocent and no one here is 'crazy,' or was found criminally insane by the court. From their behavior, I agree with this.

There is, however, one man who I believe should be transferred to minimum-security as he's not a threat or likely to escape. His only issue is his disrespectful mouth, which has caused a lot of inmates to harbor homicidal thoughts towards him. If that man stays here much longer, he ***will*** end up being killed by another inmate the first chance they get."
On a scale of one to ten? 7ish?

Roll Tide. 
How much longer do you think the escape room fad has?
This dude definitely has a mouth and eyes. 
"Ohhh in your question you were implying that I might like to find my max with you! I misunderstood. I retract my previous answer, and replace it with a firm fuck no (: "
Thanks for answering. License to kill is so underrated IMO. So violent for Bond which I like. 
"You said you were sent to your nana's home after. How was the environment? As in, was it tense and secretive? Or did she try to be as open and honest with you about what was happening? Did you spend most of your childhood in confusion because you had no idea what had happened? "

Do people playing ever panic and need the game to end?

What is violent graffiti? 
...did you brush your teeth? 
"We're you scared to be sentenced for the rape you didn't commit, or have you always been thinking they would release you very soon? "

How close of a cousin?
"He is thicc floof, he is cute floof, and he is right now taking his meds so I don't want to bother him with a pic."
"Basically if you are in prison for raping, you will be raped by others."

"Sure! I'll try to give as concise a summary as I can. Essentially, if you are dead you do not possess the consciousness necessary to be aware of this reality. So, within the multiverse theory, the only universe you can experience is the one where you survived. Thus, attempting suicide would always result in you experiencing the universe in which the attempt failed and you would continue living each time. Meanwhile, you very likely could have died, but since you cannot be ""aware"" of your own death, your own lack of existence, you will never experience that universe."
Have you ever walked into a room to witness anal sex?
What happened with the guy?
"Do you sometimes think ""My god, how is this level of evil even possible""?"
"Unfortunately, the job itself was very fulfilling and satisfying to me. I was one of the only employees who genuinely enjoyed my job. My issues were with (mis)management and unfair scheduling distributions. The final straw was when a new employee that I personally trained was promoted to Assistant Manager, and I was not told why I was not considered for the job or why my work performance was not satisfactory. "
I see you have things under control. Carry on now.
Don't sell yourself short.
"&gt; I’m sure it’s a great hotel but it lacks in presentation 

I make up for it with my good looks and charming personality :D

But yeah, we're under no delusions and know that it needs some work."
"Yes.

None that I'll be sharing in a public forum, though.

And no, it didn't involve me."
"You won't want my autograph, my name ain't even worth the ink, hah."
"My husband is what he calls ""orally bi"". He's always enjoyed sucking dick, but he doesn't really want to kiss a guy. There are lots of ways to be bi. My husband says I love you to our boyfriend (we're poly) but they don't kiss and the only sexual encounters they have is my husband sucking bf's cock. "
Are you going to sue the fuck out of her? 
Don't you judge me ass licker!
"Shit, in the litter box, I'm not allowed outside."
"Here is one valuable bit of general information that I can offer you, made by John Hopkins Institute that did a lot of work in this field. You surely can find lots of additional information doing simple google searchs tho.

Here´s the link:

"Felt that identification process was quite unfair. 

a. She saw me one day before

b. Two other actors didn't even matched description"
"I wouldn't call it a cult classic, it was a blockbuster mainstream hit. Everyone played Goldeneye in my school including people who weren't that into video games."
"&gt;peed in front of everyone at the reception

&gt;The peeing happened a little more incognito.

Riiiight"
"Hi Garry, may I get your autograph, please?"
I’m like you and now I really wanna try weed. What do you recommend?

So you gonna suck OPs Dick and contribute to humanity or no? 
I like your boring
"I hate that my reaction is that I feel so annoyed by this post. I guess it just seems like there is not a lot to learn from someone who has 5 kids and 2 nanny's and makes 800k a year. It's not relatable for almost anyone. But, it's still someone's experience and existence in this world. I just feel a mix of jealousy and judgement. I have no question but I'm guessing a lot of folks reading this probably feel the same. It's not very evolved of me. "
"Is he a floof? And if so, is he a cute floof? More importantly, does he send pics? "
I'll feel this one. Why would a grown man wearing a shirt that says genius at work spend their time posting on a children's website?

Are you having a big wedding with alcohol?
"The moments when we had to pay attention to what we had to do in order not to spoil the shot was when we had to buckle down and listen to what the director, stunt choreographer wanted us to do. Besides that when we had to await for them to set the scene up, a lot of guys would indeed go out the back of the studio outside to take smoke and tea breaks and indeed have talks over random stuff. It was very professional work but also relaxed to work around an action movie. I really enjoyed it, and if I find myself in the scene which won't be too hard I'll throw it in the reddit."
"That is good advice, the problem is I don't have this, and don't have anyone who could be that role in my life. I think that's why end up inflicting it on myself from time to time, as there's no other catharsis for the lust for pain. I will take the advice to heart though"

Kinda like smud fanking

Go and piss on graffiti in a bad part of Chicago and let us know how you deal with the “pussies” who will come after you. Bring a phone/camera,  it’ll make it easier for us to laugh at you getting your ass beat and for the authorities to find you and the “pussies” who killed you and dumped your body. "
"This man got around $600-700 for two days of work, said one was 16 hours.  Gonna assume 24-28 hours total for ezpz math, $25-30 an hour 20+ years ago.    

Those estimates are rougher than Gordon Ramsay's edges but you get the point.   

Edit:  Shit, adjusted for current inflation, not two decade old inflation...  Fuck it, leaving this here."
"Umm have you ever thought of doing your own AMA? Good luck in getting some closure, I hope OP can help you out."
"idk why but this comment made my day lmao

glad you enjoyed your experience though, my friend. "

How **YOU** doin??
"Well we've been together since high-school and he hid it all from me until several years ago (I actually feel kinda guilty about not knowing) and it's only become really intrusive on our lives about a year ago.

I do want you to know though that being with someone with depression or other mental health problems can be really really hard so it probably wasn't an easy thing"
Yesterday 
Well I found out something new about myself today..
"&gt; In what state were you in when you first arrived to the wedding?

I’m going with Florida. "
