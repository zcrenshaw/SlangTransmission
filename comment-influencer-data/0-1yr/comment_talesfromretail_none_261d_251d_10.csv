I like money bags guy he seems cool
He is. He buys vehicles on the side of the road and fixes them. Then sells them when he finds a new project.
"&gt; I never had to clean it before!

Implying that they regularly buy then return tools after using."
"The fact she was escorted out gives me sooooooo much satisfaction.  This is just like when someone wants to return something and:

No receipt

Paid in cash

Not a rewards member

Then gets pisstastic when you can't look up their purchase because they have nothing to help you out."
I hope you gave him a discount equal to the cost of the seat covers even though he doesn't need it. 
"""Well can you get one??""

""I can, but I don't need one myself.  If *you* want one, go ahead and take one."""
Are you telling me those cars just sitting on the side of the road are free? My street had dozens of those every night
That's a legit power move
She's gonna have a really hard time when she figures out she actually has to sew the pants together... 
"""oh! you're allowed to grab one, no worries! They are for customer use. They don't need to be distributed by an employee"" [customer service smile] "
I mean he got a 10% discount so yeah.
"My husband owned an auto parts store and his policy was that the phone had to be answered by the third ring.  He was helping someone one day and the phone rang, he excused himself, answered the phone and told the guy on the phone that he'd call him back in a few minutes.  The customer at the counter pitched a fit, said he should never interrupt a sale to answer the phone.  Husband explained that in auto parts the customer on the phone orders $10k a month, guy at the counter was a one time $100 sale, do the math. "
Spoilers: That wasn't actually his wife's gift. It was the mistress' gift after they found out the wife was getting a Mercedes SL.
Customer logic: There are signs on nearby products but not this one. Clearly not signing these items is an oversight and whatever it is I'm seeing on the nearby sign applies to this unsigned item I want.
"&gt; calls me a ""dumb bitch"" in Spanish

This is rich.  It rarely happens, but when somebody does this in a language I speak, I always ask them (in that language) why they would say that right in front of me."
"Unfortunately its super common in retail. Its embarrassing how many people in my family do it because ""everyone does it!"" "
"Yeah,  car flippers are not too uncommon "
"Its ok. Its our little secret that we won the argument. 
I used to to work at the largest supermarket chain with the cheapest prices. When customer like that complains and trying to be cheap. They will end up leaving with the same comment. Ill go to another store! Or you just lost a customer
In my mind im like go ahead buy more expensive. You loss not mine. I have millions of other customer "
Haha and she'll still get the car too...
I think they were making a joke about street parked cars being free. 
"I'd have gone on break too, buddy. I have no clue why people do these sorts of things. It just.. boggles the mind.."
"&gt;It's at this point that CA flashes their name tag from under their coat.

Oh hell naw.

If that isn't my biggest pet peeve on the face of the earth. If you work here you should know better. If you don't by all means go complain to someone else in authority and have them realize how stupid you are or have them come to your pitiful rescue (so I know who to avoid) because I'm not doing it myself. 

Nope.Nope.Nope. I'm more likely to cave with a dumb customer than a dumb co-worker. If they worked there, they know where the managers are and can go find one themselves.
"
We have that same policy. Generally nobody pitched a fit over wait a second for me to grab the phone and set it on hold .
"&gt; A lot of times these are thieves...

I was working at a gas station one time when this guy came in. I made eye contact with him, and greeted him as we were required to with a hearty, ""Hi! Welcome to the gas station.""

He was the only other person in the store, so I kept my eye on him in case he started looking like a helpless rabbit, so i could go help him. He grabbed a couple specific items off the shelf and brought them up to the counter. Pulled out a receipt and asked me if he could return them. 

I laughed at him and asked if he wanted me to have the manager bring up the camera footage of him pulling them off our own shelves lol. He turned bright red and left....

Two hours later, he walked back in and tried the same thing on my co-worker while I was restalking the freezer. He didn't think I was still there, but man that day was not kind to him. He's 86'd from an entire gas station chain now. "
"&gt;cut them into ribbons

So did he just happen to have scissors or a knife on him? "
"&gt;$4,000 * 0.1 = $400

&gt;$60 * 4 = $240

:)"
"That is... so bizarre, lol.

Why on earth would she think you don't work there when he can see that you're wearing a name tag? Does she think you just hang out there and out clothes away for the fun of it?"
"As a white girl who is fairly fluent, my favorite response to insults and rumblings about my service is always a well-timed, super over innocent ""¿Mande?"" I have snapped so many jerks' heads in the middle of rants. If you can't say something nice..."
My favorite part of working is retail is customers actively ignoring or disagreeing with the very advice they asked for.
"Presumably you have to get in touch with the owner and buy it first, but if they've abandoned the vehicle chances are you can get it for a song. "
"My initial impulse was to ask ""How do you function??"" But I enjoy not being fired too much."
"Whenever my ""fellow employees"" try to throw their weight around i go into pure spite mode and find their superior to report abuse of authority/bullying"
This he had a pocket knife on him. Where I live it is uncommon for you not to have a pocket knife. It is a handy tool for most situations.
I was in an abusive relationship like this. I thought she was great and she spent every minute tearing me down. I hope he realizes before it's too late.
"Good job refusing service to him. The manager didn’t stand up for you, but at least you attempted to stand up for yourself."
It's nice to have a manager that doesn't forget what it was like to be a cashier and looks out for them
"&gt; restalking the freezer

They can't be that hard to stalk. It's not like they even try to hide their whereabouts."
A lot of times these are thieves... 
"""I punch those numbers into my calculator and it makes a smiley face"" -Cave Johnson"
Sheer power of ~~will~~ fuck you money
I have customers come up and complain about prices all the time. I've asked a few to show me where they got it from. When they do it's from the wrong shelf and the tag even says a different product. When I point this out to them they still demand the cheaper price. Good times.
Probably thinks he won't find anyone better. The guy sounds like he has some serious self consciousness issues to work out
"It would suck to think I'm buying something brand-new and never used, when in fact it was just cleaned from being used and re-sold.  "
