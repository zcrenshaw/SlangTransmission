"I do that too. It's SO much fun. I actually had someone say ""no, I meant that in a mean way!"" once. Watching everyone turn around and stare at her was so satisfying."
I HATE this mentality. It also really frustrates me when the only no some will take is ‘no I have a SO’. Like why can’t I just not want to ‘give you a chance’?
"I have a blonde balayage, so, long ass roots, and I do this on purpose because my hair is A) greying and B) is still recovering and brittle by having untreated hypothyroidism for a while. So my reasons are: because I don't want to, nor can my hair take, the monthly upkeep of a look like that would do to my hair. I want to ease into going fully grey but not wreck my hair in the process. And thankfully, there's a current hair trend that allows me to do that."

"But on the other hand, if one is a consenting party in an age gap relationship, there's something wrong with the woman. Its either shes naive &amp; being manipulated or she has ""Daddy Issues"" /Gold Digger. I am in an age gap relationship but some of these men on Reddit are straight up creepy &amp; are easy to spot as predators in real life. Those are the men who are losers &amp; believe a younger woman will tolerate their crap. But sometimes an age gap relationship just happens with no ulterior motives. I approached my partner &amp; never has he ever pushed me to do something I'm uncomfortable with. I have had younger men be more forceful but I'm pretty assertive so Id put them in their place. Most people choose partners their own age &amp; abuse still happens. Just thought Id share a more positive light on Age gaps since sometimes they're only seen as negative."

It really lines my eyes.
He didn't
"Personally, I think it depends on the eye color.

I have dark brown eyes and I really like how gold (+ shades of brown and black) look on me. If I want to draw even more attention to my eyes (and the circumstances make it suitable), I mix up pink with glittery black. I guess it also depends on your skin color too (I'm a relatively light-colored Latina). And of course, if I bring a lot of attention to my eyes, then I limit my lips to clear or pale pink lipgloss.

But when you have light green/blue eyes, eyeshadow of the same color won't look so good, it's like a specific color overload in your face. In fact, the darker the eyeshadow/eyeliner, the better to bring all the attention to your light-colored eyes. Cat eyes never fail, no matter the eye color, but they'll make lighter eyes stand out even more."

"It used to bother me, but then I realized that the people who would judge me for not wanting to get married are probably religious bigots anyhow.  That made their judgements much easier to deal with because idgaf about anyone that wants to use their religion to judge me (ironic isn't it - that's one of the few things I remember from my childhood that they aren't supposed to do....).

But seriously. When you can truly stop caring about what people think, you'll be happier."
I work in a bar and I tell these fuckers to speak up or write it down. Don't get smart with me you POS
"Asking personal questions and pressing or telling you to ""relax/calm down/etc"" when you say you're not totally comfortable providing that info yet. 
- had a guy ask me when I wake up and when I go to sleep after giving him my number after her chatted a bit ok Hinge. I told him that's kind of a weird question to ask someone right off the bat and he said ""well if we end up together I want to know your habits"" and i said that he was putting the cart before the horse a bit. He reiterated how he's just ""trying to get to know me better"". It just rubbed me the wrong way. He didn't apologize and I ended up deleting him since he just had really, really weird social skills that didn't end with wanting to know when I'm asleep. 
- asking me where I work and when I say ""sorry I don't say exactly where I work right away"" and then still pressing me or trying to appear clever and ask me in a different way. (""Do you have a long commute?"" ""What brand of cars do you sell?""). 
- wanting to know my last name right away ""for their phone"". Uh, nope. 

My boss recently got a touch annoyed with me because I said I didn't feel totally good about driving a car to downtown Toronto at night to go on a test drive with a man I have never met. ""Well you've done test drives before"" ""you're going to have to go on test drives alone here, so..."". I felt like an idiot for bringing up my concern. Female real estate agents do not carry customers in their cars anymore and sadly there is good reason for this. Employers and mgmt need to remember that women have different needs than their male counterparts at times. 

I told mgmt at an old job that I had a history of abuse so sometimes being alone with a man in a room can make me feel uncomfortable. I was told ""well that's fine the walls are glass."". No, not fine. Another time I was touched on my lower back  (he tried to put him arm around my waist and I moved) and called sexual things by a male customer and he ended up speaking to management because I wasn't friendly enough. My manager hated me, but she should still have protected me instead of getting cross with me for not smiling at a perverted old man who made me feel dirty. While she was telling me that he felt I was rude, I told her what happened and she's like, oh that's not a big deal. This was in an office setting and I was a broker.  Being a ""pretty young thing"" does no make it okay for men to put hands on me or to make be otherwise uncomfortable with their words or tone. Bullshit."

"I'm less likely to be struck by lightning than I am to be in a car accident, but it doesn't make being struck by lightning any less serious."
"I think men dont think about the *implication* of things they do. Pretty much every guy you tell ""Hey dont randomly smack the ass of a woman you dont know"" is gonna be like ""yeah no duh"". But when its things like ""If you and 3 friends see a woman walking her dog alone dont all approach her so one of your friends can ask for her number"" because even if you have the BEST of intentions being approached randomly by 4 dudes while one asks for your number is SCARY. In the back of my head I'd be like ""If I say no will they hurt me? Please just dont hurt my dog he didnt do anything wrong"" and I may give out my number just to avoid an awkward or potentially dangerous situation."
"I get anxiety sweat too! (It used to be really bad. I could wear an undershirt, a t-shirt and a hoodie and they'd all get soaked at the armpits if I got stressed out. Sooo uncomfortable and embarrassing.)

I thought applying it at night worked better for preventing sweat. I used to use a normal strength Degree antiperspirant/deodorant and noticed a difference in how much I sweated after I started applying it at night.

About a year  and a half ago, I started using Certain Dri's Prescription Strength Clinical antipersperant at night, and I use Speed Stick's Power Unscented deodorant/antiperspirant after showering. My armpits barely sweat at all now (enough to feel a slight dampness, but my shirts stay dry), even if I'm stressed out. It's awesome. (If you get Certain Dri, only use it at night, right before you go to bed. It starts feeling slightly itchy/irritated after an hour or so, so it's best to be asleep before that starts. The itchiness is gone by morning, but I use lotion on my armpits now just to be safe. I think it's supposed to last for 72 hours, but I use it every other night. I'm still on my first bottle--it lasts forever!)"
"Some folks instantly repel me, but not that often. Sometimes I’m instantly drawn to someone- I cannot alway explain it, but it isn’t about jealousy or lust (ok, occasional attraction, but I’m not in the market for a new partner.) It’s more a vibe thing. I can’t say for sure, but maybe some women are more receptive to the vibes others give off and some women are very strongly putting off negative vibes for reasons a stranger can’t know. 
With the 2nd person, I now understand why her vibes are how they are. She’s been through some stuff,but she hasn’t really worked through it. She just keeps raging. I can’t solve that for her. I also can’t help her poor kiddo who lives with it and has behavioral issues because he was raised to revolt against everything. It makes me sad, but I got my own stuff to deal with."

"Or gf! And everyone’s different. Some couples think more than a few days is a long time, other a few weeks. Some women have lower sex drives in their 20s than 30s. Men often peak sex drive wise before 25 and women only after... Why not say your situation and then “ask women” if they think it’s reasonable etc?"
"I don't. Because I do not want to perpetuate the idea that if a woman/girl does xyz it means she wants it or is asking for it. 

I don't want to giggle and flip my hair as a show of interest just so that the next time he sees someone do it he assumes it's because she likes him. I feel like doing that ends up blurring lines for everyone and it's created a problem.

I prefer to be direct in my interest and non-subtle in my flirting."
"An Ohio laptop messenger bag. When I don't take my work laptop home, it's nice and light."
I guess it happens to me. Shitting the serious words i call it
Absolutely true but statistically men are far more likely to be sexually harassed / abused by other men than women.
"When information is limited, how you fill in the blanks reveals something about you and nothing more. It’s not fair to assume jealousy in every single case of someone not revealing their reason to you. That just suggests a one dimensionality of emotion that doesn’t reflect how most people work. Other commenters have already mentioned other possibilities so no use in getting into that.

Also consider that they may be revealing their reason to others besides you."
If A then B. If B not necessarily A.
"God forbid we express our shock or disgust, become angry that our boundaries have been forcibly trampled over, and assert ourselves against such inappropriate behavior. How unladylike!"

Why are grown ass men still afraid of tampons
"Went to a wedding this weekend. It was a great time, but the whole night was peppered with low key sexual harassment and fears that men don't have to deal with. Got my butt grabbed. Had a friend's dad say some inappropriate stuff. Had lots of comments on my appearance from drunk strangers. Ended up accidentally alone with some guy I don't know and felt really scared. Ended up on purpose alone with a friend who then tried to make a move on me. 

Like, I still had fun, but this is just fucking daily reality and men don't grasp that it's all the time, even when it's not happening the threat/fear of it happening is there. It sucks and limits my freedom and makes me wary of being alone with men."
"Oh, over text it means something completely different. It means leave her alone."
"Not to make light of all these comments, and I'm terribly sorry to read what many of you have had to contend with, but reading this post and the replies have convinced me I am not working out hard enough or frequent enough.

"I think attitudes like this stem from a desire to maintain the status quo.  No one can ever have a legitimate dislike of someone or something; they must be ""jealous.""  I get this attitude when I, for example, dislike spending time around women who constantly talk about romantic relationships.  They say, ""You're just jealous because you're single.""  No, I'm single by choice because I honestly dgaf about relationships.  But they never believe me because to do so would undermine the superiority they feel for fitting into social norms."
horrible insomnia
"I don't think that, and if a woman doesn't want to talk to me, I usually feel bad for interrupting her day. Most dudes do not know how to take rejection and some become outright scary assholes. I am gonna keep talking to women wherever and whenever though, my goals, meeting women, just doesn't allow for me to be lacking."
"As a lot of women said, I wish men stood up to their friends and stood up for women they claim to love. 


There's a ""friend"" in our friend group that constantly comments on my legs and ass in front of his girlfriend my (now) husband. I didn't say anything the first time because I wanted to be the ""cool"" girlfriend, but no one else has ever said anything and it's getting worse. He recently, unprompted, brought up the outfit I wore to a friend's wedding THREE YEARS AGO and how that was the day he realized I was ""actually kind of attractive."" After years of commenting on my legs and ass. 


The worse part is, my husband and all his friends are aware of it and don't like it, but they'll never say anything. So someday soon there's going to be a tipping point where I have to stand up for myself and be accused of being a bitch because ""I never had a problem before"""

"Because  a guy can't even consider a situation about women that doesn't involve men, so obviously interpersonal conflict = competing for male approval"
"When I was in high school a friend came over with two of his male friends (both of whom I knew but wasn't close to). They hung out for a while, then got ready to leave. One was already outside, my friend and the other were still inside with me. We said bye and my friend said ""Come on, \_\_\_"" to the other one, who was lingering and looking at me weirdly. The guy said, ""I'll be out in a minute."" All my alarm bells started going off and I didn't know how to get my friend not to leave... And then my friend said, ""Nah it's cool, I'll wait here."" To this day I have no idea how he as a teenage boy was perceptive enough to realize he needed to stay, but I'm glad he did!"

"There are cultures where women are taught that their main goal is to marry and to be a good housewife including being obedient and always looking presentable and not standing up for yourself. 
There aren‘t many opportunities for education so they are taught that their goal is to look as good as possible and to be as submissive as possible so they will find a man who is as rich as possible.
Those countries are traditionally poor which makes every average western guy look rich to them. Therefore it‘s easy even for older and „uglier“ guys with average income to find wives there.

Especially in some Asian and Eastern European countries."

Mention that you should hang out sometime. That kicks the door wide open for him to ask you to go do something more specific if he's interested.
"I wish that men knew that every girl has a long list of scary interactions of men starting from when she was a little girl for example when I was only three years old a man asked me to touch his penis when I was in a sees candy shop in the mall, when I was 10 years old and my friend and I were playing at the park a man showed us his penis and it was hard and it was the first one we’ve ever seen, when I was 13 years old two guys tried to grab me and pull me into their car, and so on and so on, And every girl has a list like this. The sad fact is that the scariest thing women have to deal with in this life are men. That is the thing we are the most afraid of. We have to watch where we park, be careful where we walk at night, always be aware of our surroundings, we have to live defensively. I think if men understood that we live defensively they would be more careful about the way they interact with us."

"I think the creepiest is not the posts.   I accept that there are creepy people, criminals and the criminally insane in the world.    The creepy aspect for me is the denial of the creeps by some users, and the abject silence and failure of other reddit users to be vocally outraged by so much ickiness."
"I'm dealing with this right now!! It takes a lot for me to not like someone. I have someone  (female) in our friend group who i am not fond of. I can see through her bullshit. I have talked about it with my therapist because I just need someone to vent to and she suggested I was jealous.

I'm like what? Of her?!?!? It sucks because I feel like it's so ingrained in our brains that we *must* be jealous if we don't like another female. I even found myself thinking I could be jealous. But nope, she's just full of bullshit."

"Reminds me of the controversy that sprouted in the Overwatch community about the outrage Blizzard got for actually taking action changing one of Tracer's victory poses that had her showed a lot of butt, despite her leggings, due to feedback it received from one concerned gamer. And the initial criticism was sound: the pose didn't seem to reflect Tracer's playful attitude and was mostly eye-candy.

Just the two of you? Sounds like a done deal. Lol.
"Before my grandma got Alzheimer’s, and back when I was probably 4 or 5, I remember on school holidays she would pile all 8 of us (brothers, sisters, cousins) into her car, take us out to our favorite Chinese food place, then to ice cream, then back to her house where we played hide and seek for the rest of the day. Then everyone went to college, moved away across the country, or (in the case of one of my cousins, may he Rest In Peace) passed away. We don’t have those days anymore."
The best thing I did was stop using antiperspirant and start using a “natural” deodorant. I’ve always had a sweat problem and I’ve tried so many different kinds of deodorants (including clinical strength) and used to apply it 2-3 times a day. I honestly didn’t think a natural deodorant would work for me. But now I find that I sweat less than I did when I used antiperspirant. I use Schmidt’s.

"Must you call it a ""hoe phase?"" That seems a bit rude. 

I had casual sex when I was younger and it was fine. The only reason I don't now is because I'm in a committed monogamous relationship. When I'm single, I still want to have sex. So I do. It's not a phase, nor is it being a ""hoe."""
Whenever it is unexplained and their answer is “I just don’t” that’s when that assumption comes into play.
I cry 🙄😩
"I guess it's because of social norms. From such a young age we're fed the whole, females are catty and super competitive and will steal your man narrative that we automatically assume that if two women dislike each other one is jealous and one is super nice. It's weird but it's true."
Cheese and biscuits.
"Well, I don't know where you live, but in the U.S., the things you described would be considered unethical in the therapy profession.  Therapists are not supposed to push a certain religion, but they will use the client's own religious beliefs to help them overcome their issues, similar to how AA uses belief in a higher power to help them overcome their alcohol addiction.  And trying to shame a client is something that therapists are supposed to avoid.  Sounds like your current therapist is a good one, though."
Secret clinical strength clear gel works wonders.
"Me too! I keep mine very short (trim them at least once a week) and I clean them with a toothbrush after I do yard work. I get a lot of hangnails so I should probably be using lotion on them, but I always forget to."
"I went to Zermatt a few years ago and it is EXPENSIVE but by far the best travel location I went to in EU (Rome, Venice, Paris, Berlin). Lots of good food, beautiful scenery, hiking, skiing, climbing, and tons to see. Waking up every morning to the view of the Matterhorn was absolutely amazing and being nestled in a valley of towering snow peaked mountains I got to climb every day was unforgettable. The train ride through the mountains was perfect too! I'd love to go back."
I meant marks like white marks from the deodorant rubbing off on the clothes
"Something like “morning honey” 

Nothing too wild"
I’m not straight but I did date a guy once and I’ve never minded anyone masterbating. It’s your right to touch your own body.
"I'm not a particularly jealous person. It would take quite a lot of neglect from my partner for me to start feeling jealous of the other people he hangs around. I trust my partners to not get with someone else, and I trust them to fend off anyone who tries something. I even trust my partners to have close friendships with whatever sex(es) they're attracted to. I don't get into relationships with people I don't trust.

Also agree with other comments: you aren't going to stop be able to stop someone from cheating. ...Not unless you get super controlling, which is very not good, and even that might not work."
Because some people are too dense to understand that disliking someone doesn't mean you are jealous of them.
Down. It's the only way I can fall asleep. Then I just deal with it in the morning.

Because attractive women have a halo effect. Saying that less attractive women who have a problem with her are just jealous of her looks absolves the pretty girl of any wrongdoing or character flaw. Men especially love to brown nose with that line.
"Sophomore year of HS i was asking to my first dance. it was junior prom and girls asked guys for this dance. i’m not a very outgoing person and didn’t know who to ask cause i wasn’t good friends with any guys but i wanted to go so i asked a guy in my math class that my friend suggested to ask. For our dances, we ask by making a poster with a pun on it and add a treat or something that goes along with the pun. You go at night, put it on their porch, then doorbell ditch. So I walk up to the guys porch, ring the doorbell, run back into the car, and drive home. everything went well. or so i thought.
See, the guy I asked to the dance is a twin. The next day i was walking in the hallway and i see his twin who gives me a really weird look and all of the sudden it hit me. I didn’t write who I was asking to the dance on the poster. I barely knew these boys, it was my first time asking, and i FORGOT TO PUT WHO I WAS ASKING. The best part is, is that the other twin didn’t get asked. Definitely my most embarrassing moment to date. At least it’s a great conversation piece."
"For me its been a few years of the breakup and I have been much better, but once in a while I'll run into mutual acquaintances with my ex and they'll end up mentioning how he cheated on me. It sucks because it makes me go through the whole steps of coping and accepting again :/"
But is there an actual reason as to sometimes we hate other people (without actually knowing them) ? It’s happened once or twice that I just really dislike this person for no reason

"ok so let me ask again: why would you want to bother with him at all? If he's the kind of guy who would do that, it sounds like he's an asshole. Don't mess with a guy just because he looks good. That's how a lot of bad things in life get started."

I've been told that women dont allow their men to jerk off or watch porn.
"I never got confirmation that my boyfriend of 3 years cheated on me, but he certainly left me for someone else (our mutual friends maintain that nothing actually happened until after we’d broken up but who’s to say). They started dating immediately after we broke up, and as far as I know they’re still together a little over a year later. 

The best thing I did was to mute everything of his on social media. I also got a kickass therapist and did a lot of reflection about myself and the relationship. 

Like I said, we broke up over a year ago, and I’m in a pretty healthy relationship now. Zero part of me would want to get back with my ex, but even still, I can’t bring myself to look at any of his social media and the thought of running into him still gives me a lot of physical anxiety. And I think that’s normal. It clearly wasn’t about me - just like it’s not about you - but it’s extremely difficult to divorce your self worth from the feeling of being disposable and replaceable by someone you were involved with. 

I can look back and laugh on how fucked my breakup (and relationship) was, but those feelings definitely still linger. They probably always will in some form or another."
I left that relationship. It's a dealbreaker.

"I had an abortion. I'm not sorry. I found out before my period was technically late because my whole body felt wrong. One piss stick later, and the nightmares had arrived. I punched myself in the stomach several times and took an ice cold shower. Not my proudest moment.

I then sat on the couch crying until my husband got home. Husband was very concerned, and sat with me for an hour while I tried to tell him. I would start to say it, then cry harder. Eventually, he said, ""Baby, whatever it is, we'll get through it together. Please tell me.""

Then I told him and he had such the sigh of relief. ""That's all? I thought you were going to tell me something died! It's going to be okay, we have a plan for this. We'll get it taken care of."" 

Those words were magical. In spite of taking my birth control correctly, I wasn't warned by the doctor or the pharmacist that another medication I was on would reduce it's effectiveness. So we figure that's how it happened. Anyway, Pennsylvania has a waiting period, and FUUUUUCK THAAAAT, so I made an appointment in NYC. Unfortunately my husband couldn't get the time off, so my best friend took me.

The procedure itself was boring. I remember having cold toes, having to pee for a long time, and then eventually it was my turn. It didn't hurt. I was only 7 weeks along. It did feel weird, though. Because I'm a tactful adult, I squeak-laughed ""WHOOOAAH, THAT IS WEIRD!"" when they started. 

Then I went home. I also farted the longest fart ever. So it was about as mundane as a trip to the DMV. Actually, it was at least funnier.

A year later, I doubled down on insisting to be sterilized, and found a doctor who was willing to do it even though I have no children. My husband and I high fived on my way into the prep area on the day of the operation. 

So it didn't hurt our relationship. We had always had a plan of action, and we followed through. We'd rather chew broken glass than be parents."
"tbf, being approached by 4 random dudes as a guy would be pretty freaky too lol"
I had an abortion. My boyfriend was supportive of anything I wanted to do but neither of us wanted or were ready to become parents. It didn’t affect our relationship.
"I think it depends how it was said. I think overall it can be sweet, but sometimes it can definitely come across as creepy depending on how you say it. I know it takes courage and guts to say those things so I do have respect for the men who reveal their feelings."
That actually makes me feel better.

So by simply calling it the ""female/male latrine"" and making it is professional and clinical as possible eliminates that possibility. 

I had to sit through the EO briefings because something like this happened. it's not something that just spawns out of the ether, despite how pointless it is"

And when their friends know that he’s a rapist they still keep him around because “he’s a good guy otherwise.” Like what lol how
Basically rarity. Very few of them were made and they were usually some of the first ones of a specific animal to be released.
"Flip it around. Of course they want attention. They were raped. Pay attention to the rape victim. Listen to them. Sheesh. 

Victims of crimes want attention. Attention leads to prosecution."
"If you said nicely to me that you were, I’d consider it."
"When I got a call telling me I'd gotten a major scholarship. Everything became possible, and so many doors opened!"
"Not in that moment, no. That moment was more of an agreement that neither of us *plan* or *expect* our relationship to lead to children because neither of us are interested in having them. 

I can't pinpoint an exact ""I never want kids"" moment, it was just assumed from that conversation. I've said it a few dozen times since and it's never come as a surprise. To add to it, we've had an accidental pregnancy plan in place from the very beginning."
"I got my tubes tied in 2016, at the age of 30. I had to help raise my cousins and my little sister, and was pretty much over the whole child-rearing thing by the age of 14. As I got older I realized that I DON'T have to have kids. Everyone kept pressuring me to do it, especially since I live in the Bible Belt, and I got pretty angry because I felt I was only seen as an incubator. I've asked doctors to do the procedure, and none of them would touch me until I switched hospitals altogether. The first appointment with my new gyno, I had a list prepared, and he said he didn't want to look at it. He just asked, ""How sure are you, that you don't want kids?"" I told him I would never have them, and then he gave me a list of dates to have the surgery done, told me to pick one, and that was that."
I wish I could be as strong as the average wimpy guy.
"When I saw a job posting for a position 2 hours from where I was living.

I sat on that thing for a couple weeks because I was scared to make such a big move. I couldn't stop thinking about it, though, and I eventually decided to just fill the app out.

I got the job 2 weeks later. It's been three years since then &amp; I am making way more money than I ever thought I would, and I have a circle of friends who really are friends. I haven't had real friends in about a decade.

My life is incredibly different now and *so much* better than it used to be."
"So I am a guy in STEM and I definitly can see how this is true once you get the job. But I have seen preferential treatment on the hiring process a bunch of times.

My boss litteraly told us once that he wanted a woman for the next job opening (to be fair we were 99% guys but it's not by choice we just have way way more men who apply), he called this doing some ""positive discrimination"".

&amp;#x200B;

All in all I did agree with him in a way that it was a positive move and a good thing to do but it's still preferential treatment."
I recently got a Coach purse from a thrift store for $15. I've been carrying that for the past few weeks. It's just big enough to fit the myriad of bullshit I carry with me on a daily basis.

"I would like to add on to this that the only thing I’ve heard men say about this issue is that it bothers THEM that they are seen as a physical threat and that it’s not fair to THEM that women are sometimes afraid of them even though they are not violent toward women. Way to make everything about you, certain dudes."
It's easy for me to get laid for sure.. but to find someone that wants to get serious with me is a whole different ball game and not an easy one
Dammit Gavin
Not at all and I won't tolerate jealousy in partners either.
"I used to be very jealous in romantic relationships, unfortunately. My mom raised me as a single parent and often isolated me from people (she has serious issues) so for a long time I felt very threatened if anyone tried to be really close to a partner. She instilled in me this idea that love was about ""us against the world"" and she was just a paranoid person in general. It took  losing someone I was deeply in love with due to my jealous behavior to realize that I couldn't go on with that mentality. I spent time working on myself, working on my issues and confronting everything in my life that made me feel the way that I did. The person that I'm with now is great, we have a very open line of communication. We talk fondly about people we used to love, share stories, etc and a year ago I wouldn't have handled that well. A relationship without jealousy has been so much more fulfilling, fun and easy. He's in a band, so girls hit on him frequently but I know he's a good person and I completely trust him. Sometimes people really can change :)"
It’s complete BS. In my experience.

Pizza rolls. Maybe about 3-5.
Those specific men are dumb as fuck.
I'm trans and when I started HRT my strength dropped very suddenly. What was a mild annoyance before now takes the wind out of me. I sometimes worry about it because most people still read me as male somehow and I'm tall.
"The idea that men respect another man's ""property"" more than he respects a woman saying no. For example, when a man is hitting on me and I say I'm not interested, he would most likely keep trying. Whereas if I say ""I have a boyfriend"" they tend to back off immediately. At least in my experience."
"Recently this one guy kissed my hand in the train station and asked me to ""come back tonight?""

Now, that isn't as bad, but I am fifteen going on 17 and dressed up for dad's birthday and hes a fucking 40-year old based on his looks. Yuck."
Hand sanitizer. The regular stuff. Kills all the bacteria. No smell for hours. Trust me.

"That sex is not the most important thing in a relationship. And that I don’t have to have sex with them after a certain amount of time we’ve been together. Just because I’ve been with you for 4-5 months doesn’t mean I should have given it up by now. To some people, sex is a beautiful thing that should be done on a intimate level with someone you truly believe will be with you for the rest of your life. 

I believe if your partner leaves you because of the lack of sex, you aren’t meant to be, or at least not a good match. My boyfriend and I right are both virgins but have done other sexual activities (almost two years dating) and we both agree that our friendship/bond is the most important aspect of our relationship. 

Our sexual attraction is temporary while the bond and friendship of it is everlasting."
"Extremely inappropriate sexist comments. I don't care if you're not talking about me, if you're being sexist it's wrong. No, rape isn't funny. No, I don't want to know who in the office you find fuckable. No, ""bitches don't need to just chill."""
"Hmm, well, I had a very very serious pregnancy scare recently. I actually have an IUD, so it was a potential emergency. We had been relying on just the IUD, no condoms, because they’re so effective. I was experiencing crazy pregnancy symptoms and even the doctor was worried, so they did a blood test. The two days of waiting were agonizing. 

During the scare, I came to the realization that I would never be able to actually get an abortion. I always thought that I would if needed, I’m pro-choice, but when the time came to actually consider it I absolutely could not even imagine getting one. Honestly, I was even a little excited at the prospect of being pregnant. Which was possibly more terrifying than the scare itself.

Thankfully, I wasn’t actually pregnant. My boyfriend and I talked and agreed that we wouldn’t go down the abortion road if I were to actually get pregnant by accident. We would both regret it for the rest of our lives. We absolutely want children together, just not yet.

We’re extremely careful now and use a condom every single time. We’re also more open and talk about our figure children more often."
"Mine started thinning in my early thirties.  I went ""No Poo"" (shampoo alternatives) and twenty five years later I haven't lost any more."
"Please don’t fkn touch me. I wish this was common knowledge. It’s happened very often and it’s never been welcomed. 

Even if it’s a joke, or whatever you are probably making that person uncomfortable. I don’t really know of ANY circumstance where my back needs rubbed at work. Where I need to be grabbed in anyway. I’m not talking like touching my arm or hand."
"I think you have a very weird chip on your shoulder. All I said was it's important to look for non verbal consent and for enthusiasm because a lot of the ""grey areas"" of sexual assault and harassment issues usually involve a claim that ""The victim didn't technically say no"" or ""But he said yes"". To avoid any complications, making sure your partner is enthusiastic and not relenting or saying yes reluctantly could be a positive step. If you are still willing to be intimate with someone who looks obviously sad or not into it then you are a big part of the problem. I personally don't have sex with a man until he's professing how much he wants to and is looking enthusiastic. That's all I said. Also women saying no has not always worked clearly so that point is moot. Like I said: Look for enthusiasm."
I’ve been experiencing this as well. Why are they so awkward and won’t look me in the eye.
"""I'm gonna rape you"" ""I'll make you my wife"" ""Let's go make children"" Personal questions about how much I know about sex, like way I masturbate or stuff, when I didn't knew anything cuz too young. ""Your a slut like your mother"" ""You got great boobs/ass"" ""You like to ride that bike huh, you'll grow a big booty, and we love big booty"" (80 year old men or something) After that one i've stop riding bikes for like 10 years.

Just a little part, but feel good to write it somewhere after years."
"You: “you know how you feel about Joe Schmoe?”

Your friend: “yeah that guy just bothers me”

You: “that’s how we feel about her”"
"I had a boss who paid me minimum wage, wouldn’t allow sick days or breaks even after working 10 hours on my feet, and expected me to work very busy shifts completely alone. I’d requested a day off 2 weeks in advance for a family event and she scheduled me anyway. When I asked her if she’d seen my request off notice she said “yes but you are not guaranteed the days you requested off.” 

I told her straight up that she WILL respect my personal time just as I respect company time. I told her that this job isn’t the only priority in my life and my family will ALWAYS come first. 


She backed down and gave me my day off and never ignored another request."
"Yeah I’m fine but idk I told my manager about this kind of thing, bc it wasn’t the only thing like that he said to me and there were other workers who would say similar things to me as well but my manager didn’t give a fuck I guess. Hope the restaurant industry has changed since I was in it :/"

It’s very hard but as the years pass it hurts a little less. I think of him as a stranger now. I’ll be okay. Thank you so much!
I'd laugh over it but it wouldn't bother me at all. Arts aren't supposed to always be smart \*rolls my eyes\*. I normally don't care about any negative criticism unless it's really from somebody I care like my mentor who wants help me improve. that's it!
"Alton Brown after his live show in NYC three years ago. He seemed like a normal, down to earth guy!"

same but it works
"In a different sub I replied to a guy who was saying a woman calling the police for her friend's dad coming up behind her, grabbing her, and kissing her neck, was a waste of the police's time since they would be more worried about ""real crimes"". People genuinely think like that."
"Not a toy...2 princess Di calendars. Dad bought it and made me ""keep them nice"" in the top of closet. I recently found them in a box of stuff he packed up and have to me. Worth about $7-$10 each, but the old whistle I used to run around with turns out to be worth $40-$80. Can't sell it though bc my kid found it and loves it too."
"Hell, I had male customers touch me when I was working in retail in ways they would never touch a man. A man once grabbed my arm, hard, while asking me a bunch of inane questions. Then he got upset when I jerked away and told him not to touch me. He laughed at me.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry. Anyway. That sort of thing really makes me uncomfortable. Male co-workers or contributors, usually in their 60s-70s, would always call me ""sweetheart"" and touch my arm/shoulders at a newspaper I worked at right out of college. Gave me the heebie jeebies."

"This is exactly the words I used to tell my best friend (who at the time was engaged) when she asked me if my partner and I plan to marry. She responded with ""well, no one NEEDS to get married....."" and immediatley follows that with ""so why are you guys even together then??"""
"My grandpa is 86 and is just falling apart but he refuses to believe it. He claims that he “hates old people” and refuses to believe that he’s an old man. It’s honestly ridiculous. He can hardly go up the stairs or wipe his own butt. 

He insisted on living alone when my family tried to get him to move into one of their homes. He even refused to have a hired care-taker to visit him. The final straw was when he’d forgotten he’d lit a cigarette and set his apartment on fire.

Everyone was okay but now he lives with my mom (in my bedroom of all places) and is still just a total jerk."
The only thing I’ve ever envied about men is just that they tend to have naturally thicker/fuller eyelashes than me.

no. she could've gone to the police and said he tried to rape her."
Dont dip the pen in company ink. Experience.
"Well this guy online (probs in his mid 20's or something) kept hitting on me and then later on joking about having sex with me and I was like 16 and I felt uncomfortable. When I asked him to stop, he threatened to kill himself. I felt so sick. I didn't even know the guy, and he didn't know what I looked like (I didn't post any pictures or anything). He was just like ""You're nice"" and then started saying all that stuff. A lot of other people said similar nasty stuff to me as well on the same social media platform so I ended up blocking a lot of creeps."
My boyfriend has been arguing with me for 24 hours now that women's clothing doesn't have pockets because women don't really want pockets otherwise the demand would necessitate the supply. So we're probably breaking up and I literally have no hope if men can't even understand that women's clothings don't have pockets because of the fashion industy and sexism.
Horrible work life balance.
"     I rarely comment ,but as someone who knows a lot of ""male nurses"" that is by it self a controversial topic. Truth be told i wouldn't recommend, comments like you said are a pain in the ass and too common . Also there are ALOT of  people who don't like to be welcomed by 'male nurses' being the main componentes of this group WOMEN , sadly because of safety issues . 

     I already got tired of receiving secret or whispered ""exchange"" requests caused by this reason, which by the way is very well understandable. In various cases when the nurse is female both sex feel safe , even so I came to understand that in some places male nurses are also strategically keep for more problematic cases and where the female nurses dont feel safe ."
Men/society/the patriarchy value women based partially on youth/fertility/attractiveness. Women internalize this and feel they lose value as a person with age.
"I think I've seen this in unsolved mystery shows as well, but the first place I saw it was on reddit. There was a young hiker guy who went missing. His body was never found I don't think. They did find either his phone or a camera. It just had a bunch of pictures of the forest he was hiking in. In the last picture, there is the vaguest hint of a person's face in the brush. If you ever looked at this photo, you probably wouldn't think twice, but knowing its the last thing from a missing person's camera...

Honestly whether its a conveniently shaped shadow/bush or an actual stalker, I can't decide. It is super creepy to think of though. I get the heebie-jeebies just thinking about it."
My favorite jeans. I got them before I lost weight and they look like trash on me now but I can't get rid of them. Also my Super Mario undies that I could only find in a size too small. They also look like trash but in a different way.
"I still feel like men don't pay attention to nonverbal cues enough. Maybe they need a class that actually goes through nonverbal language for them to get it. Consent wasn't taught in my sex education in middle school or high school. Anyone who had shitty sex ed classes often turn to porn to figure things out, and I've heard many stories of people doing things in bed because they ""saw it in a porno"". Porn cannot be the sex education kids are getting!"
Don't tell me what to do with my face. Mind your business.
"For sure, but for there defends, even if they are disgusting, my mother is a pedohpile so they were kinda right. Complicated story"

"Chris Colfer (Kurt from Glee) during a book signing. He seemed nice but i literally talked to him for like, 3 seconds

Jaret Reddick (lead singer of Bowling for Soup)
at a concert in a bar. Super nice guy. I was able to talk with him and get a photo. My middle school self was obsessed with BFS, and it was great meeting him"
"I used to work as a courtesy clerk and part of my job was working in the bottle room where people return bottles. The bottle machines were older than me so they often broke and I had to hand count people's bottles. This guy said to me one time ""I want you to smile while you count my bottles""... Never do it, it's rude. It's never about the person's happiness, only about how you want to perceive them."
"Teacher saw me fixing my bathing suit top at the beach on a school trip when I was 13-14 and told me I should just take it off since we were in France. 

It was gross. This guy was at least in his 50s and made everyone super uncomfortable during the whole trip."
"I have a whole basket of clothes that dont fit anymore, but I'm keeping them ""just in case"" because my disordered eating ass self refuses to concede that this is what size I am now."
Damn good on him!  More men need to detect the creeps.  I think it's the best way to reduce rape.  Can't prove it after and it's way to complicated to expect victims report.  This is the way forward I think at least.

A vintage dress my grandmother wore on her honeymoon. Can't seem to get rid of it but it really doesn't fit well (ladies wore girdles in those days). Also not really my style at all as it is way more feminine and twirly than I tend to wear.

Those people have some serious misunderstandings and issues with the standard normal human bodies of their fellow humans. They should probably get some therapy for that. They certainly don't have the maturity or basic human decency to be in any sort of sexual relationship.

"Where I'm from catcalling is extremely common so I won't even go there. It starts early and it carries on into adulthood - I'm 30 and it's still a problem, even if less frequent.  
  
* The **most** inappropriate I can remember is my family and their friends making jokes about me liking this friend's tomatoes (slang for balls). Basically he grew oxheart tomatoes and it was one of my favourite foods so I was always super happy to visit. I don't understand why people, including my own mother, would make jokes about balls and a 7 year old.  
  
* When I was about 8 or 9 my mother's friend put his hands on my thighs and it made me uncomfortable enough that I got up and ran to the bedroom where my mother was dressing up to go out with him. My mother insists I was making it up. I don't remember it clearly anymore, but I remember very well feeling in danger.  
  
* Naively exchanged numbers with a taxi driver so he'd pick me up from the same place later on - he spent the whole night calling and texting me. I ended up staying overnight at my friend, because he knew the address and I was worried.  
  
* When I was pregnant (sadly, underage) my cousin's boyfriend constantly nagged me with questions about sex and what positions was I doing now that I was heavily pregnant. Gross. So gross."

"Let’s say that women translate that strength into a majority power share.



Women have evolutionary incentives to give birth to things - ideas, governments, relationships - wherein since the beginning of time, war, violence and conflict have primarily been caused by men. I have zero doubt the world would be more safe if women were stronger, because their strength would not be used to oppress.



Women also tend to, perhaps due to a deeper evolutionary inclination to nurturing than men, invest in rights such as education, health care, equality, and personal development. Now the world is safer and better for more people.



Finally, women democratize communication and power and accidentally give men too much. The worst men (for there are many wonderful) use their tiny lizard brains to once again subjugate women through making up religions with fake male gods, shaming their sexuality and telling them who to be and what to do. A vote for Donald Trump was a vote for toxic masculinity.



Back at square one, only women are stronger? If we could do one thing to fix this insane planet, it would to give 51% of power to women. Men have been f’ing it up for so long I think women deserve a chance to be equally as poor at it. Even men in my life all agree women should be running shit."

"This is one of the things I fear the most about getting married, etc. 

My boyfriend does work 12 hour shifts 13 days a month, which is full time, but when he is at my place, he will sit and stare at the TV while I do things.. idk.... 

My dad watched TV in the evenings after dinner and such, but he was constantly busy doing things during the day. Nothing in our house would go unfixed. Meanwhile, my boyfriend's family let a broken toilet sit for like two years. They used the upstairs toilet only to urinate because it didn't flush.... oh god.... I just can't imagine."
"probably because we're cramping, always craving food, tired and bleeding out of our vaginas every month lmfao"
"I don’t think it’s that unique, but I sing in the car. Like full-on, “my life is a musical” singing. I’ve done it for years, dating back to when I was a little kid. I just really love to sing, even though I’m only ok at it."
"That relationships with women (no matter how serious or casual) should never be about ""getting something"" from them. Whether its sex, love, loyalty, status, attention, or care, the question should never be ""How can I get her to \_\_\_\_?"" or ""How can I get \_\_\_\_ from her?""

Women are not here to provide for men (just like men aren't here to provide for women). Relationships—of all types—work best when you focus on what you can give to the other person, rather than strategizing on how to get what you want. If you do want something, ask. Then respect the answer. Do not try to manipulate/pressure/force your way to your desired result."

"Yes same with me! Perverted cat calls, inappropriate touching or obvious leering all happened between about 11-18. Now I'm nearly 30 and get next to none of this nonsense."
"I told my brother about something that happened with a guy in college. It LITERALLY was not rape, not even a little bit. I was 100% willing, but just regretted it later to the point of crying. My brother (who attended the same college as me) basically just couldn't believe that I would willingly do something regrettable, I guess, and WENT TO THE STUDENT AFFAIRS OFFICE TO REPORT THAT I HAD BEEN RAPED. I got an email asking me to meet with the woman in charge of student affairs. She had all these questions and I literally had to sit there and tell her ""I never told my brother I was raped. I regretted it afterward, but it was consensual from the beginning. My brother WANTED it to be rape because apparently he couldn't imagine his little sister choosing to have sex.""

Honestly the part that bothered me the most was that I could tell they had absolutely 0 intention of doing anything about it even if I had said it was rape. It was obvious they were just doing their job to let me ""get it off my chest"" or something so it didn't blow out of proportion and affect the school negatively. 

But anyway, your comment reminded me of that.. basically, for as many men out there who would complain about false rape accusations, there are just as many men out there who will push you to report something falsely because they can't imagine their sister/daughter/niece/friend possibly having sex with someone."
"So many female associates of mine call each other girl.  Seems more of a case by case basis?

"Ugh this is so relevant for me. I had a colleague call me ""madam"" yesterday as in like, a little madam. 

I was so taken aback that I didn't say anything but stuttered out an answer to his demand instead. 

I've since decided to confront him tomorrow and let him though not's not cool, polite or professional and if he does it again I will escalate to our manager."
"In my experience (which may be different from yours) I have heard the terms “white knight” and “SJW” be directed at more extreme folks. “White knight” meaning a man who essentially thinks “women can do no wrong” and “SJW” meaning “crusades on an issue for the sake of crusading.” Unless you’re a level 16 Antifa Paladin, you’re probably not going to be called either of those terms."
Childlike but genetics sucks and I would never put that on anyone but the dice.
"That sometimes we can be bickering like hell, but if someone hurts me she might kill them.

Still teens, and she taught me how to not get caught doing “bad kid” stuff by our parents, and she taught me how to be more social. I love my sister."
"I'm 5'10, chunky, have broad shoulders, and a not-very-wide pelvis. Not competing or anything, but I feel tall and sexy next to my friends who are mostly like 5'2 and very curvy."
Gee which is worse?  To have my feelings hurt because not everyone trusts me on sight or to literally live in fear and not be able to go places?   Hmmm...give me a minute I’ll have to really think on this. 🤦‍♀️
"I have curves and i highly doubt anyone would think i'm a boy. But people constantly tell me they thought i was a lesbian, a butchy one at that. Don't like it that much, but it's not like being a butchy lesbian is bad, so, whatever."
May I ask why?
"Dont women slap guys for rude jokes? 
I saw more girls get in physical altercations at school that guys ever did."
"For me it was when I was able to achieve a work life balance without compromising my earning capacity. 
Im (30) a mum of two who works fulltime but because I put in the hard yards and long hours early in my career im now in a position that allows me to have the flexibility i need to be there for all the school events, do drop off and pick up but still earn a modest salary that, with my husbands income combined, offers us a very comfortable lifestyle."
Wtf is coition?!
"I figured, hence the clarification."

"If it happened tomorrow, I don't think much would change - initially. After  a while I think we would see a shift in cultural thinking away from the woman-as-victim/man-as-predator narrative that were still telling each other and our children nowadays. I'm afraid we might see a spike in violent (and sexual) crimes against men (and other women) by women. However, given that we are already gravitating towards gender equality as a society (bumpy as the ride may be), it might actually speed up that process in the long run - hopefully without overcompensation. 

If it had always been a trait of the human species...our society would probably have developed very differently. From an evolutionary point of view, the patriarchy was a fairly 'sensible' system for much of early history, as women were both weaker and thus less suited to certain tasks, and also the only ones capable of bearing children and seeing them through the first couple of months/years of their lives through breastfeeding. If women were more physically powerful, yet still 'precious' as childbearers...possibly we would have seen less intraspecies violence because the ones most suited to it were also the least 'expendable' from a reproductive point of view.

Or, possibly, you would see the development of a separate class of biological women who took up social roles related to protection, combat, potentially governing (possibly a third gender), while a separate class of women would take up social roles related to child-rearing. This class might, however, be expected to be celibate to preserve their physical health (pregnant women or women suffering from STIs make a shitty combat or labour force no matter how strong they are). Family units might consist of two women (a 'mother' and an 'amazon') and one man. Men's position in this society might eventually take to areas of intellect and craft...or slavery and servitude. Possibly both. 

(are there no alternative history novels exploring such a premise? I feel there ought to be)."
So you believe that strength would protect you but not a weapon?
"As someone who has worked in both adult and children's ER's, women most certainly have a higher pain tolerance than men in every aspect."
I wash my hair when I need to which isn’t always when I need to wash my body. Washing our hair is a very 21st century thing.

I'm not sure I understand this question. Are you asking what we think about during the act?
"They’re closer to cats than anything else, I more of used them as a comparison because many species of big cat have a dominating male."
"One important factor in the creation of the patriarchy is the fact that women can get pregnant. Especially when agriculture and state societies were fairly new, women spent a large portion of their lives being pregnant, limiting their abilities to do other stuff. This is not as true today, but of course still true to an extent depending on culture, etc."
My gf is a powerlifter and does boxing and kick boxing training. I'd say she is at least twice as strong as me. Nothing weird or different has happened so far.
