Was there a second HD / SSD to boot from or is this just customer speak for ""it doesn't boot""? :)"
"Deleting any user data is a red flag for me. I don't do it (well, maybe something that's called ""Test"" or ""Demo"") but user data is the users issue. If they can delete it they should.

But mentioning ""HR"" and data deletion... No ;) 
"
"&gt; can you e-mail me one?

You know some days I wouldn't be surprised"
Unless the request is coming form the listed owner of the mailbox and we verify in writing from them it's not getting deleted. 
What kind of techies you are hiring if space error message was cryptic.
"Wow, you guys need a list of approveers to stop shit like this happening. "
"&gt;and even after we pointed out the poor wording of his ticket description, thinks he is completely blameless in this incident

He is. It doesn't matter who's making the request, a request from a single user never, **ever** leads to deletion from **anything**. Doesn't matter how it's phrased, doesn't matter who's making the request."
Or stealing company property.  Because that's exactly what she was doing.
"Ahhh, the old ""Technically followed the request of the ticket"" defense.  
Nevermind the fact that any tech with half a brain should be capable of understanding that context surrounding a ticket is almost more important than what the ticket says."
"I'm used to other teams being filled with morons, so I always try to over-explain what I need done or what I've done and why I'm passing the ticket on. 

At one company I learned if I assigned a ticket to another group to pretty much list out the steps they needed to take to actually resolve the issue, cause they'd never figure it out otherwise. "
"If I ask somebody to point a gun at me to test it, I'm not *completely* blameless if it goes off. That's the only real point of contention here.

Unless the user was literally a child."
"Gosh this [bag of twenty tokens] is so bulky. I wish there was a more convenient solution to having to carry around a [bag of twenty tokens]. Something smaller and lighter weight than a [bag of twenty tokens] would be much easier to manage and I'd be less likely to lose my [bag of twenty tokens]. Silly IT, they always seem to find a way to make life harder for us. "
You are an extremely dangerous individual. It's funny and this was a funny story. Really good job and it was a hilarious read. But people like you also scare the shit out of me. I know you are out there somewhere... And that bothers me. 
Honestly?  I think he fucked with it offsite just to fix it onsite.
"Given that this is a thread about lawyers, I figure this quote from *Humor In The Court* is appropriate:  
&gt;Q. What is your brother-in-law's name?  
A. Borofkin.  
Q. What's his first name?  
A. I can't remember.  
Q. He's been your brother-in-law for years, and you can't remember his first name?  
A. No. I tell you I'm too excited. (Rising from the witness chair
and pointing to Mr. Borofkin.) Nathan, for God's sake, tell them
your first name."
"DZZY is the acronym, but I can't for the life of me recall what it stands for... but it does prevent overspin of electrons, which when over-revved can fly apart inside the controller, frying the transmitter....

"I have both that problem and the opposite of that problem simultaneously.

I get emails and phone calls from co-workers saying ""hey, &lt;process xyz&gt; is down, can you fix it"" or ""$somebody can't log in, call him and sort it out please"". No tickets entered.

Then the other end of the spectrum: We are a 24/7 operation but our tech support is not. After business hours, it is a callout. (I'm somewhere in between a super-user and tech support, I'm not officially part of tech support but I do a lot of the menial stuff for them.) When you try to submit a support ticket, the text entry box is auto-filled with a message that says something to the effect of ""IF THIS IS A CALLOUT, DO NOT ENTER A TICKET! CALL 1-800-xxx-xxxx TO HAVE THE TECH CALLED OUT."" Invariably, techs will come in on Monday morning to find that at 2:37am on Saturday, someone will have put in a ticket saying ""server abc is making grinding noises and smoking, need someone to come check it immediately""."
"Back when Iomega Zip drives were a things, a defect in the dial could cause a click of death on the driver's that would then pass on the CoD to the next disk put it them.

I got a coupon from the class action settlement for $15 store credit from the Omega online store so I guess I had that going for me."
"It can possibly also lead to the person thinking that you're going to do it. Can definitely see an id10t thinking to themseld that when you said that, you didn't say no, and because they're your superior you're going to follow their orders."
"""And yet here we are."""
And people keep wondering why I have such a large storage room...Why do you have all the old gear in there?  Because I need backups for critical gear and/or cutover testing.  We want to cut it up and make it into offices.  No.  Critical. Operations.  Backups.
"I dislike the ticket system we have since it re-opens a ticket after closure if the submitter replies.  After ticket completion, I make a final note ""work completed.  No reply needed"" and the close the ticket.  User replies back ""Thanks!""  21 days later, the ticket is flagged as overdue.  Close ticket again, user replies again ""thanks"".  

Arrgh!.  That's why our system has 105 overdue tickets in it."
"&gt; it's too small to fit in your pockets.

Uh.  I think you mean “too **big** to fit,” right?"

"Should be. 

“Welcome to ‘remedial training’ for &lt;insert day one, week one IT fuck up of choice&gt;. 

You will notice I hold in my hands the cat5 ‘o’ nine tails.....”"
"I completely agree with this.

People tend to be over objective on their messages. I like to give at least two paragraphs so I can explain everything in detail, and also be polite about it."
95-98% blameless
"Probably, but my goal was for him to fix an ongoing problem he had been out to fix 2 times before... ""Swap modem, good sync cst happy"" were his notes each time. "
"Yeah, I'll add, always CYA - Cover Your Arse, especially when deleting things, as it puts the ball back in the requester's court. . "
"After a week of no complains I would have told them “btw, this is just a dummy device that is not even plugged in. Now that you confirm that everything has worked for over a week, could we remove it?”"
"I once did something similar. I was doing user administration. Ticket came from service desk saying to ""reset the password on X account"". I do so. (I really don't have a reason to doubt the ticket - the service desk owned the ticketing system so if they put in a ticket, it can be assumed to be correct. this ticket has also been approved - by the manager of the help desk and the manager of user admin... soo.... yeah.)   
However, I immediately remembered that X account was a service account used by applications.  
Contacted the user who submitted the ticket - ""hey, you said to reset the password, so that's what I did. Was that really what you meant?""  
He freaks out: ""No, cancel the ticket!""  
Me: ""Too late bro. already done. I'm going to need the old password to change it back.""  
Him: *finds and gives me the old password*  

If I remember correctly, he actually wanted the account unlocked, since someone had locked it by using the wrong password too many times."
"&gt;... Which if you look at one end, it's clockwise...from the other, its counter clockwise. 

Not true, the twists would be the same looking at it from either end.

"Lawyers working on issues were tech is central, such as software IP, are usually part of the tech-conscious minority. They need that expertise to draft contracts and litigate claims in their tech-focused field.

The rest rely on experts when tech issues come to the fore. The key thing to understand here is that ""surprise evidence"" is very, *very* rare in American courts. Lawyers have months or years to sift through evidence and a general right to see the other side's evidence before any trial or dispositive motion. In the case of falsified screenshots, we'd almost always become aware of them long before they could affect the case. We could send them to an expert witness for evaluation, and the expert could either (1) prove them false, or (2) testify to the possibility of their falsehood. Tangible evidence like screenshots must be authenticated (their origin satisfactorily proved) before they may be introduced in court. A tech expert could probably raise sufficient doubts about the provenance of fake screenshots to make authentication impossible."

"First chance, ""accidentally"" delete his account.  Presto, no more emails waiting for him."
so... system admin here. I feel like one of the main rules of being a tech is people don't usually know exactly what they're asking for. always ask for clarification if it's something out of the norm
