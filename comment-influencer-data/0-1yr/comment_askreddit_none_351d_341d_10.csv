"Did you read it yourself? The post comes to the same conclusion as the one I linked, which is while Soviet figures were distorted, allied contribution to Soviet production is still less than a quarter of their tanks and aircraft, the most important areas of production for the war effort, followed by less than half the tires. About the only thing the allies supplied significantly to the USSR was aircraft fuel and explosive powder, and the USSR *still* got the short end of stick compared to Great Britain. The post you link also wrongfully states that Britain supplied approximately 40% of heavy and medium tanks in the Soviet arsenal. The chassis they were referring to as pointed out in a reply to that post were mostly light, tailed by medium - both in tonnage and armament. The vast majority of Soviet heavy and medium tanks were Soviet made."

"I mean, Hitler wasn't a leftist so...."
"The assassination was the trigger, but not the cause. Germany at the time was making serious moves into Europe, not unlike what happened prior to WW2. The situation in the Balkans was already very tense, which was further made worse by Austria-Hungary's aggressive behaviour towards the region. So it wasn't the ""sole cause"" for anything.   
  
No country at the time was insane enough to go to war over the death of a single dude. Franz Ferdinant was important, but not **THAT** important.  
  
To say WW1 happened because of the assassination of a single guy is very ignorant, to say that BOTH World Wars happened because of that is even more so. "
Is there a tldr version of this?

"You can rephrase it all you want but you’re wrong in the first place, the dictionary itself says so. Creative is an adjective for the word create, and create is to well, make something, to describe someone as creative is to describe them as being good at making things. Skill and talent can go with imagination to create something sure, but you still needs to make something, no talent or skill, you can’t make something that good and then not as creative, just having an idea isn’t that creative, and by some/most definitions making ideas doesn’t even count as being creative.

"The facts are that resources were forcibly funneled into Western nations in which white supremacy was the status quo (this dynamic still lives on in many ways through neoliberal structures). Non-white people in these countries have been largely denied access to these resources that were plundered. Not all white people have directly benefited from colonialism, but all white people have indirectly benefited from white supremacy, which was created to justify and maintain colonialism. "

"I think it's fairly likely a person at that income level would have some kitchen appliances and consumer electronics like a smartphone, television, and computer; as well as possibly equity in a vehicle. In some places other than the coasts, a person making $32k/yr might even have equity in a home - $90k buys a two or three bedroom house in some places in the country, and that's about how much mortgage you can afford at that income level. 

$10k would actually be pretty lavish - the median income in a place like Uganda, for instance, outside of city centers, is something like $150/yr USD. *Median* income - median income in the US is $55k, for reference, so we're not talking lower class, here. You could keep up with the Zuluka-Joneses for 30 years on just $4k. I bet you could scrape by for 50 years, just like I bet I could eek out 50 years in the US on $1.6mil.

So, between all those things, I do believe somebody making $32k a year could find $4k if they were truly walking away from *everything*. We're assuming no debt apart from a mortgage and a car loan, and that may not be realistic - but they're going to have a hell of a time collecting on your student loans if you're living in a cinder block shed with no electricity in central Africa."

"It’s not, if you know academia. The supposition that academia = intellectualism is a disservice to intellectualism.

Examples include totally useless majors like Religious Studies and Communications. These are just the inevitable outcome of a setting where students can pay to learn about whatever interests them. Schools are happy to take your money and talk at you for 4 years.

Then there are the majors that should be somewhat useful, like Political Science and Journalism. But you’re way better off actually finding work, even low level work, in those fields than spending tens of thousands on some decrepit academic pretending to know what they’re about.

And then there there the majors that should definitely be providing something valuable, but something seems to be going wrong with them. I have never met a Philosophy major who wasn’t a blowhard, half-crazy, nigh-sociopath white guy who creeped me the fuck out. And Psychology seemed to attract people who wanted to get a grip on their psychological problems. Those people need therapy, not Psych 101. But once again, the school is happy to take your money.

Finally we have the ones that will simply never make any money, which is the topic of the OP: including my own, English Literature and Creative Writing.

The beauty of Academia is that it doesn’t purport to be useful. Not all knowledge needs to be useful, and true discovery and enlightenment requires an unfettering from utility. On balance I wouldn’t change Academia. I’m simply pointing out what anyone who’s been there should know: that when you cast away the link to utility, you inevitably get some useless shit. It’s not that radical a thought.

Academia makes no promises about outcomes. Before you leave they dress you up in some robes and ceremony they invented themselves to make you feel like you’ve accomplished something. But the true test is whether you’re able to take anything you leaned back to society and forward into the rest of your life. Otherwise you’re just one of those people whose knowledge and experience *only* matter within Academia itself. And you know what those people do? Get PhDs and go into Academia. It’s a bit of a self-sustaining cycle in some areas. *Some areas,* mind you."
