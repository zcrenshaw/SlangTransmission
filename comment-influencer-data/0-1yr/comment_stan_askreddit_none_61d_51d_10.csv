"I just love stan Lee's ""the suit always fits - eventually"" and then that big ass smile. Even though its animated, it is by god the very best stan lee came out of all of them"
"Stan twitter is absolute garbage. 

The kpop community on Reddit is mostly very friendly, I haven't really seen any hostile reactions to people not liking songs or groups."
"""It always fits... eventually.""

Stan Lee, Into the Spiderverse"
"Yeah I'm a fan of X group but the fans (mainly on twitter) are fucking delirious and even engaged in illegal behavior lol. You can't distance yourself from the fanbase, or even criticize them because then you're just toxic.. if you don't find every member attractive then you're a fake fan, if you don't stan this era or this song then you're a fake fan as well, etc. etc. which isn't even the worse of it but it's so stupid. Glad I'm actually trying to engage with good fans now and trying not to let their shitty deeds get the better of me, but it's sad cause I just want these idols to have a non toxic fanbase"
"Eminem . I'm a stan, but cant stand some fellow stan's attitiude ."
Fuck death for taking Stan Lee from us
