"The bands that I got into trouble for listening to (Van Halen, Def Leppard etc) are now background music at Walmart, the UPS store..."
"The moment I realized I needed to break up with my ex was when I realized I got more physical contact from the person cutting my hair than my partner at the time.

Not a fun realization but def a “surprise turn on” cause I used to hate haircuts."
"Airplanes! Your modern long-range aircraft seats more than 300 people, has thousands of safety features, flat beds (even double beds in some cases or suites), refrigeration, ovens, thousands of hours of entertainment on high-def screens, wifi, some basic emergency medical facilities, communications equipment, tons of cargo space and sewage / waste management systems - all while flying 36,000 feet in the sky at 500mph allowing you to cover thousands of miles in less than a day.

To me it is nothing short of magic."
The Strangers. Saw that movie when I was younger and it def hit home. The area the couple lived in looked very similar to mine and it made me paranoid that people may do that just for the hell of it.
Talk with a  custody lawyer. AFAIK that's not legal and her police officer family members aren't involved in any way in a custody arangment. It's a civil thing. You def need to find out your rights and speak with lawyer though
