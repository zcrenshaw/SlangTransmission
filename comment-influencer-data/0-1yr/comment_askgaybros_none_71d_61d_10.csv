"Honestly, any mom that doesn't love her children is a disgrace to humanity."
He trusts you.
"Don't say that.

Don't give me hope."
"With identical twins often being so similar in so many more ways than just looks you might have given him like a little identity crisis of his own. He might be worried about what it means for him, or what people will think it says about him or something like that. Just give him some time to get used to it. Two weeks really isn't that long and chances are things will go back to normal after a while when he's had some more time to process this and realise nothing really has changed."
"Break up. He shouldn't change who he is and you shouldn't change what you like. This is a dealbreaker, break up."
"I come from divorced parents, and I can tell you, if you two are on the same page on parenting, a divorce is not gonna fuck up your children. I have zero anger towards my parents, because they made their best effort to make me understand that I was not the reason they broke up, and I grew up to understand that if they had stayed together, in an unhappy marriage, that would‚Äôve been much worse.

I applaud you for not being impulsive, and being so aware of your wife‚Äôs feelings, I honestly don‚Äôt know how I would act if I was on your shoes.

If I can give you any kind of advice, it would be for you to seek therapy, and try to find the best way to work out all this that you‚Äôre going through.

Also know that you deserve happiness, and I‚Äôm positively sure that your wife and your children want you to be happy. It will be hard in the beginning but I‚Äôm sure it will all work out in the end.

I‚Äôm rooting for you!"
a completely different person
What more cues do you want? If you weren't penetrated in that shop it was probably because there were some customers around.
"A toothbrush and a charger are great ways to show him he‚Äôs welcome. The charger will come in handy for other guests, too. By a 2 pack of toothbrushes, tell him you got yourself a new toothbrush and picked one up for him, too."
"&gt; I'm not even small 6.5-7x5.5 isn't too bad right?

Dude, if that's a REAL 6.5-7 inches, you were WELL ABOVE average."
"Oh, work bitch."
I don't know where comes our obsession with big dicks. Small dicks are cute.
"The gay ‚Äúart forms‚Äù of shade and reading originated in the ballroom and drag communities. I recently watched the movie ‚ÄúParis Is Burning,‚Äù which explains this part of the gay community. The way the movie explains shade and reading others is that it is all in good fun, where everybody can laugh about it afterward; even the one being read. This has evolved into just being mean to each other for the fun of it. With social media and non-face-to-face communication, it is difficult to tell if somebody is being mean because they are friends or if they hate each other. I hope I helped explain this well enough as this is a subject that I do not yet understand completely."
Gay ex-muslim here. Sorry you're going through this! You have my love and support. Time to find a new family that loves you for who you are.
"He is your little brother but, at 19 years of age, he is a man. 

I totally get the desire to want to protect him and guide him but I would respect his privacy. 

Maybe reach out to him and let him know that you're aware he's on the app and that you're there to help if he ever needs any. 

Outside of that, he's got to live his own life on his own terms. I definitely wouldn't try to force him out if he is gay. 

He may just be a guy that likes getting blowjobs and Grindr's a great place to get blow jobs pretty quick without any hassle. 

So, just because he's on Grindr doesn't mean he's gay.

I actually know a guy that identifies as straight and goes on Grindr when he's horny so that he can find guys to blow him. 

Now, whether or not I believe he's straight doesn't matter, he identifies as straight so I respect that. 

I don't know you or your brother so these are just my opinions but I would definitely give him plenty of room and try not to force him in any direction in terms of his sexuality."
Was he one of those who don't look like their pics or was he a completely different person?
If this is true I definitely want updates!
"How do you know he‚Äôs not already comfortable with his gayness? I mean, at nineteen, I was pretty aware.  You know him beat, so if you feel he is struggling, let him know you‚Äôre there, but I do t think a lunch with your friends to talk ‚Äúgay stuff‚Äù is the answer."
"Born to Muslim parents too.

My father is a pedo. I asked him what he thinks of child marriages, and he said that girls are able to marry as soon as she starts her period.

I love my dad but that's just wrong, you know? And for him to condemn homosexuality and pedophilia?

Add to the reasons I'm secretly working on my escape pod to shoot myself far from this family."
I had 2 women kinda aggressively try and convert me at a club. Enjoyed the shit out of it because I saw them genuinely getting frustrated and couldn't wait to tell people about this encounter haha
"Wow. Amazing empathy here guys! I think this is a prime example of how we as people have lost the ability to actually empathize with another and do nothing but interject our graceless opinions. I mean no one pointed out the fact this person lost a job because of their sexuality. If you lost your job right now and you found out it was because of your sexuality, or someone you cared about it, would you really ignore it and give such tactless responses? Secondly, belittling someone's feeling, is certainly not the way to go. And I'm pretty sure none of you would appreciate the gesture... Anywayssss, So sorry to hear all of your struggles!!! It is absolutely horrible to hear these cases as if we deserve 2nd class treatment. But even so, trying to off yourself is not the right way to go. Especially after your dad fought so hard for this country. He may have felt that it betrayed him, but that is even more reason to keep going so you can see us (hopefully) turn into the country he always wanted us to be. Shit is going backward, but it is stories like yours and so many others that can help turn this ship around. So please keep fighting. Don't celebrate the 4th, I certainly didn't Contrary to some of the other comments in, changes are made by those who say enough is enough."
They make my dick soft and my eyebrows angry.
"I think they depend on social awkwardness of people. They hope that once the person is there they'll feel too awkward to say no and just go through with it.

It's really scummy but that's what I've seen people say they had explained to them by catfishers before. (So keep in mind that this is basically thirdhand information and I don't know if it's true, it's just what I've heard)"
Or perhaps he's bi?
"i couldn‚Äôt agree more, kinda annoying"
"I feel that these ‚Äòmean gays‚Äô types are just people that were made fun or bullied, so the way they act shady or catty is a way of unconsciously staying defensive and trying not to seem so vulnerable so people won‚Äôt hurt them again."
I only worked there a couple days as a temp assignment
"You came out and immediately had a clap-back?? Welcome to the community, my man, you make us all proud &lt;3"
"""How do they know whose penis will open up to accept the other person's penis?"""
"And many dudes can tell when you're ""lowering your standards"" for them and are desperate for a lay that sticks around. You're right for the wrong reason. You shouldn't be ""settling for average guys"", you should be reassesing what you fuckin care about in the first place. If looks and dick size are all you care about that's fine, you're not ready for a relationship, just get it out of your system first."
Why do weirdos think that is going to work? Maybe it occasionally does?
And any that loves her children is a blessing
"Not so much with women but I do have this very ""straight"" by all accounts that When I mention that I got some or hooked up with some guy you can tell he always gets super intrigued. Who topped? who bottomed? how was it? I'm always kind of taken by surprise and don't ever go to into too much detail. Maybe I should get very specific and see if there is any ""growth"" in our friendship. ;)"
And big dicks hurt
"I am very ""straight-acting"" (I don't like the term either, it's not an ""act"" but it's a valid descriptor) and I'm trying to let go of a lot of my own internalized homophobia/insecurities too. I used to be embarrassed that I like certain songs or TV shows. I never would have thought I could be a submissive partner in bed. Would never be the little spoon. I've started to branch out a little bit and I guess defend my own feelings I have towards myself and it feels really, really good."
I think it would be better if they made a new superhero that‚Äôs gay rather than make this straight one a different sexuality
"No offense, but this is just the tip of the iceberg of what a lot of lesbians go through. It‚Äôs far from unheard of for men to be a lot more sexually aggressive with them."
"And it warms my bloody heart! üò≠

You go OP!"
Or perhaps somebody who‚Äôs Facebook friends with him stole his pic...just throwing that out there as a possibility.
"I‚Äôm in the same boat - you sound like I did.  I cant tell you what to do but I will say in my case it ate me up and made me miserable.  I finally had to end it.  I‚Äôm scared about the future but I couldn‚Äôt live with that lie anymore.  My only regret is that I didn‚Äôt do it sooner.  It‚Äôs not easy, but it‚Äôs better than it was."
"That sounds like gluten allergy (I have it and yes, I did fart alot before I realized)"
"fun lol

&amp;#x200B;

I once met up with a guy who was in the hotel next to mine, I'd told him it wasn't going to lead to anything but we could have a drink as neither of us had anything better to do and the guy he thought he was hooking up with was ghosting him. 

&amp;#x200B;

He buys me a drink, we talk and it goes well so we get another. At this point the first hook-up turns up (his phone died) 

&amp;#x200B;

I've got a charger so led it to him and the guy i met texts me asking if i want a threesome (we're all sat there) 

I say i'm not up for it and start typing another message basically saying if he wants some I'm happy to leave them to it. Before i can say anything he blurts out to the hookup that we're no longer interested and he's 'surplus to requirements'. 

&amp;#x200B;

Guy leaves and we get quite drunk together. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next morning i get to the client's site to discover the guy who i'll be working with very closely is the one who got told to get bent yesterday..."
He just broke up with his girlfriend 4 months ago. So obviously this isn't something that he has fully embraced yet or it's something very new.
When will the queens come around and realize that Muslims hate us as a whole? You spend so much effort defending a group of people where 60% of them would have you executed if the decision were in their hands.
"Right? Never heard a gay guy say he wasn't into white men because they all look and act like Duck Dynasty cast members, because we don't stereotype all white people that way. But when it comes to black, hispanic or asian people apparently they're all completely monolithic and all conform to the inherent negative stereotypes that people aren't bothered to challenge."
"I'm sorry for your lost, but it sounds like your aunt and your mom care very much for you :)"
"Yep, because preferences based on race are lazy and naive. There‚Äôs a huge variety of body types, face types, and personality types within every race."
When a girl finds out your gay they will actually get excited to have a gay friend... Kinda annoying if you're Bisexual but otherwise girls love making gay friends...
The unnatural hetero lifestyle.
Same tbh. I've never really cared for other peoples dick size. When ever I do bottom I always hope they're on the smaller side since it's something I can actually deepthroat and take all the way.
"I dont think it would be good, first of all because in the comics he is renown for being straight as Fuck.

Also because being the most renown superhero making him anything else than the most common denominator isn't always a good idea. 


Als9othere would be backlash and more people would hate that gays because they take their childhood heroes. They would do that and go one up in the stochastic terrorism pyramid."
"Holy shit, nice work! Even if leads to even one kid not having to go through this torture it will be more than worth the fight."
"Has he seen a doctor? It feels like there's probably some medical or dietary issue that he can get resolved, or at least get a handle on."
Yeah i was gonna say that‚Äôs like? Kinda hung no?
did you tell the girls you're not straight?
"‚ÄúI‚Äôm Moira Rose. And if you like fruit wine as much as I do...‚Äù

I die every time."
Yea that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been thinking too honestly
Disney isn't going to allow a gay Spider-Man
"Yeah, but people's idea of ""BBC"" is a cock the size of a forearm."
"""Gone"" through? Going through."
"Hi there,

Please stop trying to date my dad.

Sincerely, 

Tom's son"
Who fucking cares? I dont like any of that shit either. If some random ass gay dude tells me I'm not gay enough id just laugh. His opinion on my life isn't relevant.
"Nah, it doesn‚Äôt seem right to me. Historically speaking segregation has never been a good thing."
"I agree, but wouldn't that just mean there's multiple people who are ""the one""? It's not that they don't exist, it's just not literally one. 

&gt; The reality is: You could‚Äôve just walked past the very person that could‚Äôve made you one of the happiest people alive 

Tis pretty crazy isn't it? Yet you never say a word to each other.

&gt; ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without you‚Äù. 

Yea I agree there's no such thing as fate, it's all RNG, but I do sort of disagree with this specific phrase just being if you've ever really been deeply in love with someone you kinda just learn to deal with not having them more than being a matter of actually getting over them. I think just about everyone thinks of their ex's time to time, it's no coincidence."
Oh for God‚Äôs sake just leave him alone. He knows you‚Äôre gay. If he wants to talk he will. Let him do his thing in peace.
Beats going soft and not getting in!
"Lots of gay guys also feel very independent though, and voluntarily remain single.  After a certain age the cost of living alone becomes manageable."
Why does he need to be gay? Just let him swing both ways.
There are cute guys in all countries.
"Since they are identical. The straight one could be worried for being mistaken for being the gay one. In social circumstances, Just a thought."
"&gt; I have zero anger towards my parents, because they made their best effort to make me understand that I was not the reason they broke up,

When my parents divorced, \*everyone\* seemed to think it was important to take it upon themselves to give me the same tired lecture that I'm not the reason my parents were divorcing, that their relationship had just come to an end and it had nothing to do with me.

They were all kinda shocked that my (honest) reaction was ""actually yes I am the reason, and I'm proud of it, and don't you dare try to take that away from me!"" My parents divorced because my mother went dangerously insane and I went to my father and said, more or less, ""mom's crazy, I'm leaving, are you going with me?"" (The fact that she tried to kill us multiple times and later murdered someone else rather proves me right...)"
"I don't think you'd have a problem finding people. Some people like the idea of topping a bigger guy, and if you're upfront about saying you're a bottom, you'll be fine."
Also all these fantasies about straight people who suddenly realized they were into men and it's obviously written by a gay person farming karma because it's written as a fucking erotica novel.
"Tough one, I'd honestly just tell him how you feel. You can't be expected to stay with someone you no longer like, and he can't be expected to conform to your standards just for you.

I don't see a way to reconcile that."
That‚Äôs so good ! Proud of you papa
It's nice to see a queer couple that's just a couple and not a tortured side story or tired stereotype.
Always get a Snapchat and send some pics first
"Standing outside his place, screaming ‚ÄúWHY WONT YOU LOVE ME?!?‚Äù"
"Hello internet person, hope you are having a nice day. Don‚Äôt let rude people get you down!"
My dentist gave me a top of the line electric toothbrush to prepare for my heart transplant stuff. But honestly it is summer! My nephew might stay over so I should get an extra just in case for the beau and the nephew !
"Most people's experience of Mormons is that they're young, clean-cut white men who come to your house like a goddamn Amazon Prime delivery. Why would it be surprising that there's porn of this?"
"^ This.

And they actually get results, some thin fraction of the time, which is enough to justify their behavior to them. If they get laid with someone they think is out of their league even 10% of the time, it‚Äôs worth it for them.

And more often than not, they get a lot more success than 10%."
"You should be proud of yourself for overcoming anxiety, good job!"
Gay baiting?
"His personality seems great. I like it.

*inhales*

I just don‚Äôt see how he‚Äôs so extraordinary. He‚Äôs attractive but people on this sub talk about him like he is a God. He looks simple to me, maybe the fact that he‚Äôs famous is what makes it more attractive to most. I see a lot of guys that look like him at my university.


Pls don‚Äôt ban me"
This makes me feel all warm inside
"Maybe he‚Äôs just shocked as he didn‚Äôt know? He might also feel a little betrayed in some way, like you‚Äôve kept a secret from him. Not a rational reaction, but not an uncommon one.  I think you just need to give him some time to get used to things."
"Lol as a bi guy, I fucking wish. Most girls I disclose to are polite, but clearly not interested in a guy that‚Äôs been with guys, let alone turned on by the stories of such"
"I do as well, simply not worth the risk."
I was thinking something similar as well in terms of identity crisis. There seems to be a genetic component to homosexuality and there are cases of identical twins that are both gay. Maybe he is also gay and he wasn‚Äôt ready to address it yet or is still wrestling with his own identity somehow (being very religious)?
Did you hook up again?
Publicity pure and simple. Marvel might have a gay superhero on screen one day but it'll most likely be a C list character rather than roll the dice drastically changing a major fan favorite
"Anyone else grossed out by the talk about breeding and getting impregnated?

Funny story though!"
"Grindr is a toxic waste dump.treat is as such. Maybe change your headline to ""don't stereotype my dick and I won't stereotype you as nelly size queen..."
I called this guy after our date asking for feedback like a company would after a phone call with a service provider. He called me needy and we never talked again. Oh well ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Homophobic countries don‚Äôt get my money
"I think some doubt the honesty of undetectable.  They are unsure if they are just using it as a disclaimer, when they actually might now be"
"...can you say that again for the people in the back? I‚Äôd much rather take a smaller than average dick than one as big around as my forearm (seriously, there‚Äôs this sweet guy I‚Äôm friends with but holy fuck I don‚Äôt even know how I could take that). Saying you‚Äôre 9.5 inches, while not a turn off, is seriously intimidating"
"Unless they did everything they could to raise a good kid, and they, through horrible decisions of their own, end up the worst possible kind of shithead. Then it's okay to lose the last love you had for that child."
"Cause race is ingrained in American history, unfortunately."
You‚Äôre gay? A coworker of mine is gay! It‚Äôs perfect!
"i have dated/hooked up with several black men and i know from experience that black men, like men in general, are not all hung. it's unfortunate that guys in your area are obsessed with your dick size."
"I once hooked up with this guy a couple of times, I applied for a summer job. Then he texts me saying,  ""You know I'm the guy you just sent your resume to"". I said yeah I know. Now he's my boss and boy do I sometimes wish he could bend me over but he told me to keep it professional."
"Yeah the 2+ year court battle to try and recover a tiny percent of what was ruined for me was rough, and was a kick in the gut when it turned out to be all for nothing. I lost everything. Like everything. A lot of people in here can‚Äôt empathize because they either haven‚Äôt been discriminated against for being gay, or if they have, had better means of a faster recovery and didn‚Äôt lose a percentage of what I did. 

I‚Äôve tried working to make it better. You can‚Äôt just jump back up the next day and move on, get everything back in a week, and drop it. Life doesn‚Äôt work like that sometimes.

Thank you for your message. It‚Äôs refreshing to come to this sub to see at least 1 kind message."
username checks out
If you go to any major city you will find the majority of young men (or older men if that's your thing) are well above average. I was just in Ft. Lauderdale and Miami last month and I nearly fucking died. Seeing straight up models walking down the street with their shirt of HNNNNG.
"Awwwww well it sounds like you've got a great thing going on. When I'm single I keep spare unopened tooth brushes around so I definitely recommend that. Phone charger seems good but I generally have several around for different types of phones anyways. Beyond that, just normal stuff like clean towels for after showers, etc. And always have plenty of lube and condoms, probably poppers too if you're a top."
"Good on you for turning him down, some people have no shame. There are people out there that would pity fuck them still because they feel pressured. I had it happen once, but it wasn't that extreme. He was just less cute than his pics and he put pics of him with abs on his profile, but had clearly gained weight since then when I met  him in person. 

He was visiting the town where my beach house is, so I just ended up showing him around the town and took him to the beach instead of sex. It ended up being alright, but only because I'm skilled socially I would imagine."
"I don't wear muscle shirts or tank tops, but it's summertime where I live, so it's great seeing guys out and about wearing them."
"""Instagram famous"", and ""can't be seen like regular people""

I don't know your friend, but I already hate him."
OP should be super proud of himself. I‚Äôm the straight acting guy and would love to be able to trust someone enough to just relax for once.
Don‚Äôt hang around silly women with vicarious fantasies.
Lol yeah you're right
"No. If some guy doesn‚Äôt want me, the reason doesn‚Äôt really matter. And it wouldn‚Äôt really help anyway. What is attractive to one man is unattractive to another."
"I think a lot of it is just math:

Let's say you live in a city of 7 million.

700,000 are gay (if we assume a very generous 10%)

350,000 are male

Now let's say you get picky:

- You  want someone in the top 30% of earners

- You want someone white

- You want someone with a big dick

- You want someone with model good looks

- You want someone straight acting or super masculine

That's a very small pool of people. Yes, you might have to ""settle"" but it's mostly because your values and perceptions are out of whack."
"Because other religions don't deliver twinks in button-up shirts *to your door*, is why."
"i left one like that, despite threat of nervous breakdown/ transphobia whatever  

the 'new you' is not 'the new us', babe"
"Hey I‚Äôm a straight dude, just saw this on the fp and wanted to show support. Also, I oofed out loud when I read your response to your mother. Well done my dude"
"It just sucks when you‚Äôre open and honest, but they‚Äôre not open and honest in return."
"Goodness gracious - THIS NEEDS TO BE REPORTED TO THE TRAM AUTHORITY! Wow... this driver needs to not be employed anywhere near the public.

&amp;#x200B;

Report this immediately, brother. Please."
"You are so brave, thank you for sharing your story."
"Part of the problem is gay guys may not flirt with unfamiliar guys or do so very very subtly, in ways guys such as yourself may not pick up.

You gotta understand that until very recently (and still today in some places) hitting on random dudes was physically dangerous for gay guys."
"I went on a date with a guy who looked nothing like his pics. We had a quick dinner together and he thought we were going back to my place but at the end of dinner I said ‚ÄúWell have a nice night‚Äù and left. He led me on, so I led him on too."
"Aww, man. I'm sorry. Guys can be ridiculously fickle on these apps. I've been on for ages and people are always disappointed for some reason or another. 

There's also the underlying internal racism thing going on with a lot of white guys. There's a huge issue with people not wanting black men unless they have the potential of being hung and it's honestly really disturbing. 

Hookup apps have never done me a solid. I still use them but am constantly disappointed or I let them gather dust. You hang in there, though. I'm sure you got it all going on. Even the size you mentioned is perfect and just fine. Things will go you're way. I hope you're not stuck feeling this way for long. 

‚ù§Ô∏è"
Whoever said hell hath no fury like a woman scorned has clearly never come across a homosexual slightly inconvenienced.
Break up in a neutral area and let him have a mental breakdown...not really your problem anymore if you've broken up.
"Are you me? I literally went through this same exact thing. Recently divorced from a woman and have kids. It‚Äôs not an easy decision by any means; only you can decide what is truly best for you. I attempted conversion therapy as a means to change to make it all work, and it didn‚Äôt. Happy to chat."
"The criticism isn't about them changing their logos.

It's about them using the logos for PR and not actually remotely supporting us."
I have fucked the pity before. It was a negative experience.
"This makes no sense. If you're on grindr, or getting bjs from guys, you're at least a little bit gay"
"If a woman tries to play matchmaker with me I usually stop talking to them completely. 

Especially when they try to set me up with someone I‚Äôm not into at all. It sounds shallow but it honestly makes me question our friendship to begin with."
"I had a bad habit of coming on way too strong... like nonstop texting with guys I hadn't met IRL yet, not taking the hint when I was the one to initiate every messaging, continuing to chat with guys even after they said they weren't looking to meetup offline, etc."
"seriously though, dick size is pretty much last on my list of criteria. I care way more about your body type, face, hygiene, personality, etc.. A dick is a dick."
"I‚Äôm in this situation all the time. Bi. Smoker. My brother is straight, smoker and hangs with lots of gear heads. It‚Äôs more times than not a straight boy who likes attention. That doesn‚Äôt rule out the blow job or hand job though, if anything they are really easy to bed lol. However don‚Äôt expect it to turn into anything he‚Äôd be open about."
I do believe in that idea. But there‚Äôs a saying just because mean gays were treated like shit it doesn‚Äôt mean they have the right to treat others the same way
I disagree with their religion and many other points that many hold. But I still believe in freedom of religion and I'm against xenophobia. I see no reason why to be treat a group as a whole and discriminate on them. And that doesn't stop me for saying that they are very wrong on lgbt rights and feminism.
Well even if he's straight I can imagine it could cause a good bit of self-doubt.
"Your post history shows you struggle with your body image significantly. 

This might be downvoted, but I‚Äôd rather just tell you the harsh truth. 

Stop wishing, stop praying, stop asking, and just do the work. If you don‚Äôt like your appearance and want to be in shape, GET IN SHAPE! There is nothing stopping you but yourself. Asking and posting on reddit a hundred times is going to get you nowhere, but just make you feel sorry about yourself."
"Love is a verb.  Verbs are action words.   You don't maintain something by neglecting it.  

You guys don't need a break.  You need to put in the work together or split amicably."
"As one of the guys on grindr, giving bjs to guys, I can confirm that they're a *lotta bit* gay."
"I'm single now, but had a boyfriend at 21 for 7 months.

For me, the amazing part of having a boyfriend isn't the sex (even though it's great), it's the emotional connection, the trust, the feeling of wanting to be the best version of yourself, etc.. Your boyfriend should make you a better person. 

One of my favorite things for me was that my (ex) boyfriend would wake up before me and before he got ready for classes would always send me the cutest text/voice good morning messages. 

He'd then follow it up with the time and location we'd meet after class, and then for good measure add an ""I love you"" at the end. 

Honestly, it just melts my heart thinking about that. I sometimes go back and read his morning messages.. I've been single for 2 years now."
"‚ÄúEven though he‚Äôs 5 years old than me could he be into me?‚Äù 

Lol, yes. Very yes."
That's so uncivilized.
Pretty sure there are one or two things in his diet that don't agree with his digestive system.
I know you're joking but docking is literally a thing
"It‚Äôs not a phase, mom, this is *WHO I AM!*"
"I don't normally like it when peoe recommend this as a solution to relationship problems... but yeah, if you look at the sotuation realise that you just don't really like him anymore, then I guess that cpuld be a logical conclusion to come to."
"To me, it's because the bullying I suffered in highschool. I can see a bunch of straight men on the streets and as silly as it sounds, I prefer to walk away from them."
"Tbh everyone should have a cheap 5 pack of toothbrushes in their bathroom for guests. 

I always kept several of them on hand in case I invited a guy over and we decide he should stay the night, or if I invite someone home with me from the bar or a date"
"Oh absolutely. Especially since we‚Äôre also a minority, most of us were either the only gay person in school or one of like 2 or 3, and you weren‚Äôt attracted to them or vice versa."
"You shouldn't worry about it for 2 reasons.

1: It was your first time! You'll get better üòá.

2: Even if you don't, you'll always find people who actually think cumming fast is hot/a compliment. For example, me!"

"Well you just itemized my life. I was an outstanding Mormon with a beautiful wife and she had an amazing family. I hid that I was gay for the first 10 years of our life. I was also in the military. I didn‚Äôt want to be gay. It wasn‚Äôt something I aspired to. 

I came out to my now ex wife in 1998. It was with a lot of tears and with a lot of trepidation. But we had two daughters who were my anchors and so I thought I could pray the gay away and went to therapy and to bishops for counseling. 

So I fought being gay for another twenty years. In the meantime, I traveled the world and the US. After fighting so hard I decided to move to Florida for a promotion. It was there I fell in love with a man and we began a semi-opened relationship.

I got called back and the ex confronted me about my relationship and I confessed to her what had happened. It took a couple of more years to figure out the divorce. 

I came out of the closet over a year ago at this time. The divorce was amicable. The children are now adults and were happy for us and supported me with no residual chaos.

My parents were open and my brothers and sister were  supportive. 

I tell you all this because things didn‚Äôt go the way I feared they would. Instead I had amazing support and love. 

This may or may not be your outcome. My advise is don‚Äôt wait til your 54 to figure it out. You‚Äôre young enough to still have an authentic life. If you have questions please PM. 

Good luck my friend."
"You're pretty on the money. Plus ill add that many who see it as purely being mean are normally individuals who don't really involve themselves in the community. There fore it seems mean and snobby, think how Brits call every one cunts but it's kinda just a thing. Granted yes there are mean gays and that's what the media pushes. We have to be ""feirce"" ""sassy"" and read ppl. Furthermore, many people growing up have been exposed to ""gay coding"" so our favorite villains always have a hint of being shady, anti establishment or tired of socitey, cold or grossly ambitious, Disney is famous for this( Scar, Yzma, Ursula, Captain Hook etc"". 
 TL;DR: Media wants us to be that way and we often oblige, gay coding and misunderstandings."

There's a happy ending though, through a lot of hard work and luck he was able to come back to Europe and we figured it out from there. We've been happily married three years now."

"For me, patriotism is not a love for your country in its entirety, but a love for the good parts, and a loyalty to its potential. The US is very often the villain to people foreign and domestic, doing many evil things. True patriotism is not a worship of the symbols of a country like a flag or anthem, but what those things are supposed to represent, the ""shining city on a hill"" that we strive for.

In this day and age, one of the most truly patriotic things you can do is hate America. Because what it is right now is terrible. Obviously it can be compared to worse countries, but that's not the point. Let's not be satisfied with being better than Saudia Arabia or China. Let's have higher expectations."
"I think it's chill, this subreddit is called askgaybros but it's not like we get so much content that we should complain about it.

The only toxic behaviour here are trolls and people complaining about content. 

Literally says on the sidebar: ""This is where you can ask the manly men for their opinions on various topics.

"""Talking to straight guys is scary"" are you out? I mean I don't ever hit on guys unless as i am already bullshiting with them and I can read something about their body language or or any verbal clues... other than that its just bullshiting and findin common interests in people doesn't matter if Guy or Girl the only real difference is in your head... 

As someone who's struggled with social anxiety I can say there are some things I noticed while at University... The first step is Meeting People, now for this exercise just go for a walk, and look at people as you pass them try to make eye contact with everyone you pass... Most everyone will walk looking down at the ground and if they look up and make eye contact they will break it quickly and go back to looking at the ground or sky or eslewhere to break eye contact. Without staring them down try to make eye contact again, if you do it is said that person is interested in you... but just for the sake of trying it, just pay attention to how many people are made uncomfortable by simple eye contact, cause we all are a little socially awkward...

Breaking Through! So its hard to give advice without knowin anything about you... But from my point of view when i was at college and didn't have much interesting things going on in life it was hard to find much to talk about other than video games and what i was going to school for, and video games didn't lead to much opportunity to meet people In Real Life, some notes about meeting people... I noticed cigarette smokers have the easiest time socializing because they are forced to go stand outside at certain spots, these are great areas for bullshit conversations and bullshit conversations leads to friends... I didn't even smoke cigs but i just started hanging out in the area to bullshit with people who did. Also im not telling you to smoke weed, however for me it helped me get past my social anxiety and also Stoners make the best friends lol üòÅ. But these are not the only ways... if you go to a school they probably have a LGBT club to meet people or you could just go to any pride event.. Or just get Growler &amp; Grinder to meet gays"

Yeah and they did. But you know what? I disagree because if done well that can revamp a character that has nothing going on and because it happens gay people that hide their sexualities.
"Gay men make good friends for straight women for a variety of practical reasons. 

We are men, so if we go somewhere with a girlfriend she isn‚Äôt alone or with another woman. And two, you can talk about hot guys but you aren‚Äôt competition.

Being gay is a perfectly acceptable ‚Äúspark‚Äù to a friendship, just like being fans of the same band, going to the same coffee shop, or whatever the hell else. 

And if you don‚Äôt have friends, maybe try making some shallow ones first? They‚Äôll introduce you to more people who could be real friends"

"Ah, man! Believe me, as a fellow black gay male I definitely feel your pain. But I think this issue is more than just size. This is a problem whether you are hung or not. To be objectified and fantasized as some fetish is completely unacceptable. It is not only depreciating, but it truly undervalues us (as if we are only good for fucking). Even as someone that is hung, getting asked all the time, can I see, how big, or being told I love black dick, I've always wanted a black dick, never been with a black dick, it's my fantasy to have a black dick, generates it's own feeling of disappointment (since I am not here to be someone's dildo). The sad thing is, considering how toxic and superficial our community is, the only thing to do is be patient. Educate those that are willing to listen, but this skewed bias and thought process are everywhere.  But, don't feel inadequate. You are everything you need to be. Some guys ignorance is not reason enough to into that hole. Their loss. You have more to offer than just your size, which is a good size anyway..."

"I get how you feel. I made a video with one guy I hooked up with just before I came out to my family, it was kinda one of the reasons why I came out, I didn't want someone to use something like that against me, at the time I consented. With another experience like this, I have had a guy try to blackmail me with the video so I went all lawyer on him and explained how he was blackmailing me and when he threatened to send it around, I explained it was classed as revenge porn, he panicked and deleted it. So I get how you can feel violated when someone does this, it isn't fair on you. I get it if you consented to filming, but you didn't and it can be scary as you don't know how they might use the video, or who else could see it."

"I personally wouldn‚Äôt delete him or cut him out of your life if he‚Äôs been so nice to you, but do what you have to do to move on.  It‚Äôs hard to get over crushes, but I‚Äôve found the best way is to either find someone or something else to occupy your mind, or spend the time you spent thinking about this guy focusing on improving yourself.  Maybe start a new hobby, volunteer in your community, just find activities to take your mind off of him, meet new people, and before you know it, you‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôre past it.

I had a similar situation in high school with a best friend who I had feelings for where our lives just went in different directions and I had a hard time getting over it.  I just focused on myself, started going to the gym and working on music to occupy my mind and it got easier and easier every day to let go of my feelings for him.  Allow yourself to cry, mourn, and get all of those feelings out."

"They're definitely ready for a relationship if those are the only attributes they care about.  Getting to experience what makes a relationship successful / meaningful, or fail, is something that takes practice.  Experience is what gets people to change, not theorizing about what the perfect relationship is supposed to be.  People need motivation to change their ways, and experience is a great motivator."

"I'm curious how these ""straight bros"" who's never had a gay thought all their lives are all so adept at gay sex the first time."
"This more than anything I feel has stunted gay male sexual maturity.  Even today because there is a long, long road to go if any kid still feels the need to stay closeted.  Straight people in High School get to date and figure out how to approach a person they're interested in and what kind of sexual talk is okay and what's not with a relative safety net.  They can go talk with their friends and teachers and parents about these really strong feelings that come up and hopefully get some good guidance there.  Gay men don't get that.  We just don't.  We feel the need the hide and suppress those emotions because we're told that they're bad somehow.  So that when we finally come out, that support network specifically built for teens and puberty is gone and we're left struggling to figure things out on our own.  


This is basically why you receive unsolicited pics of gaping assholes on Grindr at 3 AM.  Some dudes out there are under the impression that it's the proper way to flirt, and weren't given the opportunity to learn otherwise.  It's why you have gay dudes crushing so hard on their straight friends for years, because they weren't told how to handle the emotions of rejection very well when their brains were still pliable.  This doesn't excuse this behavior, but it explains it."

"The Trump era and the fact that outspoken homophobia is ""cool"" again.

I actually had a falling out with a friend of four years last weekend.  He was a very good friend but he was never totally accepting of my sexuality.  He did tolerate it though. However, due to pride month he pretty much snapped.  We were drunk and he went on this anti-gay rant that was beyond just homophobic."
"I definitely relate to the embarrassment over liking certain songs.

I literally hid the fact that I'd bought an entire album (on iTunes) from my family (I only actually realised that I'd hidden the fact when my mum bought it on CD). The album was Taylor Swift's 1989 (I'd already indirectly learned about 6 years prior that I wasn't supposed to like her music, because it was 'too girly')

I guess I'm *technically* ""straight acting"", in that most of the people I've come out to have been surprised, but I guess I'm also surprised that they're surprised, so idk... I honestly think one of the big factors is that my voice is *super* deep, so that instantly separates me from the stereotype of the gay man with a high voice."
"People read it.   I feel for the frustration you must be going through.   I had similar experiences when I worked on a commercial garden farm.   It took years for me to come out to any of them partly because of a crush on one of the guys who was married.  His wife also worked there,  but whenever she was not around or it was just the two of us he would make constant remarks about sucking his dick or fucking behind the greenhouses or just random gay remarks.  I never really knew what to do because of my desire to be included, like you said, i was in my 20's.  I eventually did come out and the remarks didn't stop, instead he stated asking questions about what it was like to have DeX with men.  It was a bizarre period of my life."
"Put yourself out there honestly and without apology. Say exactly who you are and what you‚Äôre looking for.

"Gay culture *can be* self-indulgent and vain, that is difficult to avoid. But there's a silver lining dude: not all gay guys like big dicks, there are many who'd prefer to have sex with someone who wasn't big. I generally only top, but when I have bottomed, it was for men who were average or less. I don't like big dicks to be perfectly honest--they're usually attached to even bigger dicks. \[bad joke\]

It seems like you have five things going for you: (1) you're ""reasonably attractive"", (2) you have a ""successful career"", (3) you're ""well educated"", (4) you cook ""fantastic dinner\[s\]"", and (5) I see a guy who's sensitive and introspective. These are all nice attributes. 

People are attracted to confidence. I would work on learning to be confident first. Once you can do that, then you'll notice people treating you differently, and some may even begin flirting with you. Have you ever done any solo traveling? I'm guessing you're British bc of some of the words you used, so maybe you should do some backpacking across eastern europe or something, where you'd stay in hostels and meet other young 20-somethings. Traveling can work wonders, really."
"One of two things is possible.

1.  He is also gay and wasn't ready to come out and thinks you coming out is pushing him out before he's ready. 

2.  He isn't gay and thinks that with you being gay that everyone else will think he is too. 


Either way, it's something that he has to take time to process and will eventually grow out of.  Give him some time and space for now. If he starts acting aggressively towards you, I would talk to your parents about it."
"I do this too, mostly because I'm poor and can't afford to travel."

"Just from reading what you wrote it seems to me that you have a wife that listens and is kinda understanding and because of that I am thinking maybe you should bring up, maybe one or two small things at first so she's not overwhelmed,  some of this to her.  I've heard of this happening to other couples.  Honestly, it didn't go to well for many of them, but some of them are still best friends and have amazing relationships still.  It's hard to give you advice on this as I'm not in your shoes so I am not able to see the big picture like you are able to see it.  I do know from hiding my sexuality from the age I first realized I was gay (12) until I finally started coming out to people around the age of 23 made so many things harder than they would have been over that time period.  Just my thoughts/opinions, but if you love her like you say and don't want to hurt her than you shouldn't prolong this any more than needed and she may actually help you find some of the answers you are looking for.  Again, just my thoughts and opinions dude, but if you need to talk you may message me anytime!!!!!!!"

Basing everything off of words typed out behind a screen. It is a strange time we live in"

"‚ÄúHi. Not much. Just currently (laying on the sofa/watching TV/ eating a hot dog / etc).‚Äù 

Then, if you don‚Äôt really care add a simple ‚ÄúHow about you?‚Äù

If you do care then maybe ‚ÄúI noticed your profile says you‚Äôre into (cowboys / paragliding / competitive eating / etc). I once (rode a cowboy / paraglided / ate 30 hot dogs in one sitting /etc). How did you get into that interest?‚Äù"
"I figured it‚Äôs because he had such a huge bit of his childhood ripped away from him. I mean, for the better part of the last two seasons, he was either trapped in the Upside Down or possessed. He wasn‚Äôt really able to be a regular kid, moreso than the others (save for Eleven)."
I usually stare like an idiot but thats just me
"Preach dude. I'm blatino, and it seems like the first question people have for me on grindr is ""how hung?"". Its kinda of annoying dealing with these size queens who seem to have a BBC fetish. Plus yeah I agreee, smaller cocks are much more manageable on a practical level"

Baiting gays to consume something by teasing a homosexual related to it
"Not personally but its not a rare occurance to hear about things like this here.

Unfortunatly a lot of woman are completely unaware when they are sexually harrassing someone, because they are only taught about men doing it."

About gay men's attitudes - many of them either want to treat you as exotic (or) box you into negative stereotypes. For instance, when gay men say 'I like Indian men', what they most likely mean is that they like stereo typically good looking models and actors you see in Bollywood movies.
