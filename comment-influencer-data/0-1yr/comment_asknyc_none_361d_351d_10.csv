I always know which way to go when I get to the street from the subway. 
"During my morning subway commute, I can fall asleep and wake up just in time for my stop. "
Most of these guys only catcall to impress their males friends; the ones they truly want to fuck.
I can make the train delayed just by leaving my house on time.
"This, tbh is probably the best and realest NYC super power. 

When your automatically do it for stations you rarely use-- you've reached peak Prof X status. "
"This same situation happened to me a few weeks ago, only _on_ the actual train. I'm sorry it happened to you too. Don't beat yourself up for not immediately making a scene, sometimes your brain goes into fight or flight mode and you just want to get the hell away. 

I ended up changing train cars, but for what it's worth, I did make a report at an MTA kiosk later, where I saw a warning picture of the exact man who was jerking off in front of me. So that guy at least was a serial offender. I just gave them as much info as possible, like what stations we were between and approximate time. I'm not sure how much help it will be, but the lady at the kiosk was very nice and appreciative.

If you'd like to vent, I'm here for ya. It's really horrible and violating but I kind of struggled with telling people because it ""could have been worse.""

Edit: typo"
I regularly show up in the nick of time to help tourists swipe their metro card.
"About 50%, but I do it in a very nice way.  I sort of let out a quick, cheerful one, then I wag my tail.  If she gives me that “omg, a puppy!” look, I walk over and sniff her — and if I get a “squeeeee, a puppy,” I jump up and lick her.  And then I steal her wallet. "
That is living on the edge.
"I am very sorry you are experiencing this.

Being stood up has unfortunately been a thing for longer than the www and dating apps. And it is not a phenomena to NYC. Look up the Beatles song ""no reply."" Some argue that the nature of anonymous online dating and NYC culture has enhanced it.

You do not know what is going on. Maybe the person misrepresented themselves. Maybe they have there own issues. Maybe their feelings towards you changed.

My immediate advice for the moment is do not invest so much emotion and effort in somebody you never met. Make plans to meet have-way between you and them. Combine the date with some errand in the same area. And do not schedule yourself so tightly.

Keep at it. It might happen again. Focus on enjoying the process. It will work out for you.

In Central Park there are swings that aren’t in an actual playground near the 86th st entrance on the west side. I honestly can’t remember where exactly they are but if you wander along that way you’ll see them! 
Also you can see the lights and hear the train
"I worked with a guy that constantly went “tssst tssssst” to women. I would say it got A response 1/5 times. 1/20 was a successful response. 

Just enough to keep the idiot doing it. 

If that number seems high he really only targeted women from PR/DR/other islands. When he would do it to some girls around NYU they didn’t even know they being cat called.  "
My presence ensures the F train will will be diverted to the E line.
"I find this really sweet. I hope you find what you're looking for. 

My only suggestion is to go to a regular playground during school hours so it's less crowded. Or later in the evening, but that could seem a little sketchier. 

Is getting a ticket really a thing? I haven't heard of that."
"Around 14th Street/2nd Ave this lady is walking by and she spits on the street and a large black security guard goes, ""yeah baby spit it out, I like that, spit it out girl"". So fucking weird "
"I can walk full speed through the Times Square subway, during rusk hour, only looking straight ahead and not slow down, veer to the side or brush against anybody else. Too bad I'm never in times Square, and certainly not during rush hour."
"&gt; is there a way to let a complete stranger walking down the street know that you think they are attractive without looking like a dick
  
Nope"
"People are really rude nowadays.

Don’t think that it reflects on you in any way. There is not a way to figure out how common it is either. Don’t let it get to you. "
"I always tell my friends I have a sixth sense for showtime cars.
"
"As an NYC resident: This was not a taxi ride or an uber ride. You got scammed. Never take an “offered” car that’s not an official taxi; only hire Uber or Lyft from the app. There are literally hundreds of people who wait with unmarked cars at the airport waiting for people like you to trust them, and then they overcharge you. There are even signs all over baggage claim saying “if an unknown person offers you a car ride, don’t go with them” because of this scam’s frequency. It’s one of the oldest ones in the NY book.

I’m sorry this happened to you. It’s 100% not Uber; they probably made the receipt look like that to further trick people. Definitely do a charge back.

edit: For future reference, only official taxis with the correct colors, signage, and medallions are allowed to pick you up at the taxi stand of an airport. Anything else is a scam.

&gt; [Avoid Ride Invitations: It's best to deny any unmarked ride invitation upon leaving the NY airport terminal. Always use marked NY taxi cabs or airport sponsored shuttles when leaving the major NY airports.](https://www.nyctourist.com/nycinfo_safety.htm)"
I suggest you confirm day of.
Is “carbs” an activity?
"I know it exists all year round, but Farmers market in Union square to get cider and donuts! "
"Central park. 

Just walk around and enjoy the foliage. "
"Take the Metro North to Sleepy Hollow! You can tour the Rockefeller Mansion at Kykuit (the visitor center is walking distance from the train, and has shuttle buses to the estate itself).  It's one of the most gorgeous places I've ever seen.  There are also nighttime tours of the cemetery that are really fun."
"no

carbs is a lifestyle"
"Hey!

So there are a variety of things going on.
Sometimes the club produces the night, sometimes external promoters will take over a Club and produce the night.
The promoters are given a certain license different everywhere to comp drinks and tix. (Hence the big following, prob also a lot of fake followers)
There are head promoters that take a percentage of the door and the bar. And there are sub promoters that get paid by the head for bringing in hot girls. So the girls get to party for free, and are sometimes even paid to be there. The city is full of aspiring models who need a buck and a cheap way to nightlife. They sometimes get taken out for a dinner before making appearances at various clubs that are part of the one hospitality group.

The tables full of hot girls are part of the bottle service scam- they’ll be receiving regular bottle service presentations with big fanfare to the tables in order to entice paying customers to pony up for the same service.
They can give away 10 bottles of svedka  if they sell one bottle of grey goose to a finance bro sucker for $500+

Finance bro reckons he can get a crowd around his table if he takes out the black card and puts some Dom on it
"
"Dude, I just want to walk down my own street without getting comments on my looks. LET WOMEN WALK DOWN THE STREET IN PEACE."
"Thanks for the greatest tax cut in the history of the world™️ in 2017, bicycle commuting reimbursements are taxable to the employee. 

Whereas before it was a pretax benefit and eligible  as a commuter benefit. 
But don’t fret, the govt kept the car parking benefit so you know fuck sensible transportation and environmental friendly policies. 

Edit- clarification. "
Adults can not be in a playground without a child. It's to keep out the pedos that loitered there. It's on the level of a parking ticket. 
Usually $1. Only worth it if you haven't eaten in several hours and are desperate.
"Being 8 months pregnant grants 2 NYC superpowers: I can always get a subway seat at rush hour, and I can walk into any store and use their bathroom regardless of whether I make a purchase."
"As a NYC teacher,  our contract states we cannot start teaching till 8am unless the chapter votes that it’s ok. So most, if not all, NYC schools start after 8. The school I work in starts at 8:35 (an hour after my suburban school started) and ends at 2:50. When your son is looking at schools make sure you talk to him about that if he thinks it’s priority to start later. The NYC high school guide you get at the fairs usually has the daily times of each school in it or you can google it."
"Yeah, that'll be probably too tight. Plus, it'll be hard to be approved at that low of a margin. I would recommend roommates. Use Roomi or facebook. Find something where the people are very solitary too then. I live 1.6k a month (roommate too) and 5k a month pre tax.. and it's tight. Yours would be even tighter.. would not recommend. "
"Leo's

Edit:

Also, I never really go there. Too expensive. Too long of a line. In a strange way, it's also too 'good.' I like my bacon, egg and cheese cheap with slightly stale bread and a disorderly yet highly efficient and sloppy storefront (often a deli, bodega, or shitty cafe).

That said, if you're looking for ""the best"" it's Leo's."
"I don't get it either.

Luxury apartments are more useful to foreign investors and money launderers.

We should have an occupancy tax on commercial and residential property in NYC.

If a place sits empty you pay a fine. It's ridiculous to have a housing shortage and empty apartments. Market forces are supposed to discourage this, but there is obviously a problem somewhere."
"Chambers Street on the J/Z, maybe. Or insert your least favorite subway station."
When I went to Costa Rica in high school the...hissing?  What is that sound even called?  LOL. It surprised me.  Our host family had to tell me wtf was going on.
"Bottom line is how much profit can be made. If a 1.4x increase in construction costs lets the units sell for 4x over non-luxury units, why would a developer do anything else?

"
"Did it for a while. $1800 1BR on the UES, and my take home pay was around 4K per month. 

 I was broke all the time and it set me back years in terms of investing for the future. I loved the solitude and privacy, but being that financially burdened is no way to live. "
Ah -- the finely tuned internal subway compass. Good on you.
"Damn that sucks. Heard about an incident where a girl matched with around 100 guys and asked them all to meet her. She ended up hosting a competition to select the ""best"" guy for a date. 

Guess it's dependent on the person."

"You actually wanna know? 

This was back in the late 90s but me and my friends would hang out in parks or on our stoop and a few of my friends would cat call women. Typically it was two of the guys in our friend group who did it the most. 

Most of the time the women just awkwardly walked by. Some got sassy and mad at us and told us to fuck off. 

But sometimes, a girl would come up, and would typically be sassy to them and tell them they aint shit and all that. But they did have some interest, and usually would strike up a weirdly hostile/flirty conversation. The most common exchange would be ""you couldnt get this if you tried"" or something similarly sassy, and then the guy would do something impressive in some way or another or brag about himself and maybe spark her interest. Or she would say ""that isn't anything special"" etc and the cycle continues. But its usually obvious, even when they're being hostile, that they were interested. Otherwise they wouldn't have approached them. 

It worked, actually a few times it really did work. 

However, this was more common in the past I think. Part of it was that old school dating typically involved the guy trying hard to get the girl to be attracted, but in order for the girl to not be seen as slutty, she had to play hard-to-get, which usually involved a weird combination of rejection and flirting with the guy. The guy keeps on trying, and eventually she gives in. You can see this in a lot of old school movies, where a guy enters a diner and flirts with the waitress every day and she rejects him, but eventually accepts it and dates him. 

In no way am I condoning it. Its frankly awful behavior and in retrospect I am disgusted at my friends for doing that type of shit. But yes, it actually did work in a small percentage of women. "
"I almost always tell (95% accuracy) when the subway is about to arrive so I can get in front of where the doors open and snag a seat if possible.  I shouldn't give away my secrets, but you can tell when it is about to show up because the vibration on the tracks causes all the little tubby chubby rats to run around with a little extra crazy.  They are my Paul Reveres."
"The ability to give canvassers the vibe that I don't want to talk to them, and it actually working!"
Super Villain.
