THATS IT! THANK YOU!! I’ve been googling for hours and couldn’t figure it out.
I want to pick plums but this city does support only apple pickers.
"Look on ebay, craigslist and other websites that sell used equipment for your camera."
We're on the way to the airport. Can we do it there somewhere? Or online?
they're intentionally trying to be vague. they don't owe you or any other reddit stranger any more information if they don't want to divulge it.
mine have been awful the last few days
"Yes, and I'm telling them that the more specific they can be the better responses they will get."
"This was very helpful!!! I found a few references supporting the $20 cap, and also this post with a legal analysis of the ""landlord duty to mitigate damages"" in cases of early lease abandonment ( [http://www.tenant.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=13800&amp;p=58222#p58222](http://www.tenant.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=13800&amp;p=58222#p58222) ) which is a separate item I'm looking into. Much appreciated, thank you again."
"Yes 100 percent buy a metro card . Like everyone said the 7 day unlimited one . Regardless if it’s harlem , downtown or under the Christmas tree you’re going to need it . Yes you can walk but you’ll waste hours , energy and body temperature getting around ."
"Okay, thank you that what I was looking to hear."
I'm opposite. Zyrtec doesn't do anything for me but Claritin is a miracle worker. Never tried Allegra. Damn personal biology.
yeah just take [this](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/05/04/automobiles/TAXI/TAXI-jumbo.jpg)
I mean any bar in the city will have the Jets/giants on . Find a sport bar and just go
"I was already planning on visiting the Intrepid, but thanks for the suggestion!"
A lot of the NY to NY bridges offer additional discounts for NY ezpass holders.  I live in NJ but keep my NY ezpass.
"26yo male 
237$ a month on a 2019 suv 

Dropped from 300$ once I turned 25. So that’s cool ."
"I haven't been back to the area in years, but Masker Orchard in Warwick drew a huge crowd every year when I lived nearby and it's available by Jersey Transit."
"Per-ride card all the way. An optimistic analysis of my riding patterns suggests the monthly unlimited would be cheaper, but it never works out that way."
"Also, if you think ahead, you can buy new sets at case price for roughly 40% off pack price and dole them out a few at a time to keep him happy for weeks."
"Startup founder here. CS doesn't care about your schooling. Use the free period to work on side projects (ie volunteer to help businesses with their websites, go study market needs and make something). Once you're proficient, start charging for your work. Incorporate as an LLC. Do this throughout high school and college.

With a good work portfolio/real revenue from your companies, people will take you seriously. Also you'd learn what makes money and how you can provide value."
This is the correct answer.
"Yepp, I always end up at the urgent care this time of year with a lung infection. I went to CityMD last year exactly one year to the day I went the last time for the exact same sickness. My allergies cough is starting to turn into a lung infection cough so here goes year four.."
"In my case it's Bus -&gt; Train -&gt; Bus

AKA: Live and work in an outer borough.

I actually live rather close to my job (15 mins if I drove), but each leg is longer than I want to walk on most days (but I've walked all 3 when things go boom), and it's all bisected by highways, so I have to go out of my way to cross them."
Definitely going to buy one now! Did you install it yourself or have it professionally hardwired?
"Macy’s, right now. Seriously… I was up there earlier in the week and most suits are between 40 and 50% off. You might even be able to get an extra 25% off for a special. They have all of the major labels."
"Sure.  At the very least, good YouTube footage."
What i would recommend is filing a police report and providing the serial number. Chances are if someone stole it they will be looking to sell it. Police  use the serial number information to check local buy and sell shops. As required by law the serial number needs to be provided..... HOPEFULLY the SD card is still in the camera.
Do you typically leave your dash cams in your car when you’re away? I’m afraid of it getting stolen.
This is definitely the closest someone can get to outlets without leaving NYC.
"Cheddar scone at Veritable on the UES. It was labeled as being from Delices, I think, but I don't actually know where else to procure one."
"Yes, my allergies are going crazy today all of a sudden"
Low effort - Fine. He's not really wrong. u/jesuschin isn't wrong because you want him to be. He's likely giving his own experience and this is an opinionated question.
Beechers! That mac and cheese &lt;3
"That would work.  Or do the (F).  If 57th St is not accessible, 47/50/Rockefeller is."
Adafruit Industries is based in NYC. I don't know if they have a retail store. The School for Poetic Computation might have a public event.
With 2 huge bags I wouldnt take the subway. Just take the taxi. Def worth it.
Traffic is going to be difficult. I'd take LIRR then Airtrain.  Can you pack less junk?
Sortedd. That works. Perfect. This is super helpful.
"Thinking about taking the day off tomorrow too, they're filming a TV show on my block tomorrow and could be a legitimate excuse to be nosy..."
He's getting downvoted because it's low effort and also he's wrong.
"Any gaming store should have em. Uncommons, the compleat strategist, forbidden planet."
"Don’t forget the Men’s Warehouse. Suit sale $180 right now, but their true value (I’m a loyal customer) is having a wardrobe consultant that will work with you on your budget."
Thanks. Just looked it up. Wtf they closed all but like 2 locations and those are apparently trash now.
"The only reason I get a monthly is because work does it for me pretax. It's good to have so I don't worry about it and if I don't use it on the weekends, my daughter does."
"My allergies have practically been non-existent for about the past year or two, but that does explain the massive increase in snot I've experienced recently when waking up."
"If you owned a restaurant, would you allow a totally untrained, random stranger fuck around in your presumably extremely expensive kitchen? Does that sound like something *anyone* would reasonably do?"
"Wait, you took pictures on a camera?  Like without a phone or automatic mobile backup?  That's hard core yo.  Sorry to hear about your pics."
"NY EZPasses issued through MTA or the NYS thruway authority don't have a monthly fee.

Those issued by Port Authority do have a $1 monthly fee."
alternatively transplants complaining about the noise and congestion.
Try Tea and Sympathy on Greenwich Ave. In the Village
"How dirty it is. Whenever I go to Boston or another city, it reminds me how dirty NYC is."
"Thank you, that was quite an interesting reading, it seems that no matter what one is expected to deal with noise through the city, that's unfortunate of course, but at least will make me focus on looking for noise-canceling solutions"
"It's worth having in general but mostly for on the road accidents. You never know what may happen, and it's your best weapon against a he said/she said situations."
"Cops.

I know. ""Bad apples"" and all that. But whenever I have needed them they've either been rude (when asked about a situation or for directions on closed streets) or they brush off legit concerns as ""civil matters."" Now I either just try to ignore their shitty overtime-paid attitude or their presence entirely.

They're also congregated together at nearly every transit hub eyeing you over with the biggest fucking guns I have ever seen in my life. When I think about it, it bothers me, but I try to ignore the reality we live with."
"Honestly Manhattan gets taken care of.  Go to the smaller working class areas of the outer boroughs and it's amazing how sorry they are.  The city would never let it's ""crown jewel"" Manhattan get TOO bad."
" I don't consider that actually addressing homelessness. It's an option that I'm glad is there, particularly in the winter. It does not address the systemic issues around homelessness. That is my point."
"This is fucking dangerous.  Once they reach a certain period (30 days I think) you have to go through a formal eviction process if they decide not to leave.  We let a friend of a friend stay with us on the promise that it would be one week, she begged for a second week to get her shit together, we warned her at the beginning of that week that this was going to be it, and at the end told her ok, we are bringing your bags to the subway platform now.  Turned out when she realized we were serious she suddenly found somewhere else to go."
"I too had a horrible experience with them. They essentially misplaced a bag of our laundry for a few days. Didn't bother to tell us or even show up to scheduled drop-offs. A few days later and several phone calls and emails later, they magically found the missing bag. 

Overall a piss poor performance. I will never use them again."
You can get tickets for ezoo after parties that are happening in Avant Gardner at Brooklyn. Way cheaper than going to the actual event. But hopefully you get to go to Ezoo at least once! Such a wonderful experience
Why would you want to put yourself through that Hellish experience?
Used to be diviera drive
Omg I used to love this place!!! They're gone?? They used to have this salad I was obsessed with. And their tomato soup was my favorite.
"This is totally doable, go into a restaurant that you like around 3-3:30pm, tell them you want to talk to the chef about staging and just explain your passion and interests and wanting to just be in a couple of days for free. The big thing is though that you'll be really not doing much hands on cooking, more like peeling garlic and shelling peas. 

All in all, if you wanna work in restaurants one day a week for free its totally doable and happens all the time, but you'll be learning much more about how kitchens run as opposed to like practicing how to cook.

relevant article about some old dentist who just went around and staged at places with no experience.

Thanks for the info!
Were they a Boston chain? I always associated them with Boston not nyc.
"Those fees are assessed and collected by the condo board. They’re not fees from the landlord. Ultimately a court or the legislature may have to clarify that, but that’s the way it’s been interpreted and applied in the industry."
South bronx by 4 or 5 train... Midtown in 20 mins easy.
"&gt; Restaurant tipping is 18-20% of the total bill

That's completely wrong.  Tipping is based on the **pre-tax** total.  Are you tipping servers 18-20% of an additional amount that a computer calculated is owed to the City and State?

Second, tipping is *15* to 20% or more.  Doubling the tax results in a tip of 17.75%."
"Most people tip on the total. Sure, you don't have to, but I wouldn't say ""that's completely wrong"" just because you don't"
What are you on about? Alleys absolutely fix the problem of piles of trash. They allow for dumpsters which put the piles of trash out of sight and mitigate the smell significantly.
The subway au jus. (The sludge water al the bottom of every subway track.)
