"The episode of South Park where stans grandpa talks about how he doesn't remember stuff and he says something like

""I used to have a dog. When I put her down I wasn't sad because I knew I would always remember her... now I don't remember what she looked like""

And then Stan went on a shopping net Maori and told a guy to kill himself and was serious about it "
[Stan is okay with this.]
"Stan Lee

Gonna be weird watching marvel movies in the future without his cameos"
