If you're willingly collecting an antiquated physical medium of older artists and point it out as a hobby when describing yourself, then you clearly have very little capacity for being self aware, unique, and/or interesting.  Even the instrument you've chosen to learn is tired, unoriginal, and played out.  You appear to be the human equivalent of the bottom page in a quadruplicate carbon copy form - desperately trying to imitate the generations that made a better and more impactful impression before you, but unable to retain anything of merit and/or quality."

Age 16: 
Straight A's &amp; you're on the cheer squad, life is good.

Age 17:
You start hooking up with the resident douchebag from highschool &amp; become addicted to coke. You also now enjoy being fucked in the ass.

Age 18:
Guess he didn't only fuck you in the ass because now you're pregnant &amp; have herpes. Not a problem though as a quick abortion has you sorted.

Age 19:
You don't get into college &amp; now work at Hooters. You're railing lines of coke in a bathroom stall at work while being fucked from the back by a dirty biker that hasn't showered in 2 weeks.

Age 20:
You've lost all your friends &amp; you're riddled with disease. Reddit is your only sanctuary now... Or so you thought. "

You take them home let them cum on your face in the hopes that they will respect you as an independent strong willed woman. In reality you are just another cum dumpster. You go to your 5k follower instagram page and post about how you love your fans and for the ‚Äòhaters‚Äô to stop being jealous. This is just fuel to the fire for those trolls that hit your insecurities so accurately you cry yourself to sleep with nothing but your vibrator and the memory of when you were relevant and popular in school.
