"The orphaned hero. It's like having at least one dead parent is a shortcut to making a character sympathetic

Edit: A lot of great points made -- I def appreciate it. This trope is common because it is effective. I guess I don't like it specifically when it is supposed to make the audience feel sympathetic for the character -- which is rare on its own. Even in this capacity, readers rarely feel bad for the orphan character because they are orphaned rather because it explains their situation. I just think it's a tool that is used too often. "
Lackawanna resident here. Def something like that happened and it's horrible. 
"Check out citizenfour, it's a real time documentary about the whole thing going down; it's actually really interesting to see his thought process throughout the entire unfolding, and his reports back and forth with journalists. Def worth the watch. "
Friend ships def end over shit like this
