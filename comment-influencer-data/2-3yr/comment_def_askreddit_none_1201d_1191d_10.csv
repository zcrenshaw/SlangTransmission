"I definitely appreciate the input my artist gives me. When he says ""yeah you def dont want that or you should do it like this"" he gives me a good reason and usually just his opinion is good enough. it is his profession after all "
"This reminds me of an experience I have never shared and I am not sure ended the way I remember. 

On a family road trip when I was in grade school we stopped at a McDonald's somewhere in nowhere Ohio. I remember being allowed to use the restroom on my own while my parents ordered. While in the stall an elderly man asked me to let him in, he was very persistent. I def got bad vibes and tried to convince him to leave, which didnt work. At some point I just froze. 

He didn't stop and tried to get in. I remember my young mind thinking he was trying to jimmy the lock by sticking his unbuttoned belt through the slit.. but honestly it could have been some other thing flat object (idk maybe a shoe horn???).. I just thought it looked like a belt at the time. I don't remember what happened next but the memory I have is of a muscular/tall blond man being thanked for saving me.

I do know that no police were contacted. I am fairly certain I was saved by a random stranger who contacted my parents while the old creep fled... but I have never had the strength to ask. Part of me worries that I suppressed something, but I am somewhat certain that I haven't..

So pretty sure I dodged a bullet... fuck now that I have finally put this into words I guess I should ask my parents."
