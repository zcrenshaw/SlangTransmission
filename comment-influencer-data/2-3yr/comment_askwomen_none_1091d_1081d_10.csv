"We had very long conversations and obviously found one another attractive but didn't think it would happen.  We were very comforatble with each other, admired each other.  We would watch films, go play pool, drink together, go for long walks, talk for hours  (often about our various dating woes). 

Eventually our friends got us rascally drunk and left us togehter and we had some very steamy sex and haven't looked back since.  We have been friends for ten years, a couple for eight years, married for three and a half."
"I've been the boss whom women have let know was pregnant if that is of any use.

My experience is that it depends on the boss.  If you trust them to keep their mouth shut (like having a diabetic or bad food allergy as opposed to spreading the good news) then earlier is better.  These experiences have been in large corporate environments if that matters.

I've dealt with all kinds of pregnancy situations over the past 15 years of so and so I understand that additional latitude is necessary.

I know that no meeting involving a pregnant women should last longer then 35 minutes or so without a 5 minute break.

I know the hard way that if you don't tell me and something goes wrong I have to deal with it without that prior knowledge. The worst case was maybe 5 years ago when I walked by a young technical writer sobbing in her cube.  This kind of thing is unusual but not unheard of and I usually don't intervene, so I walked on.  Thing is something didn't sound right in the way she was sobbing - so I turned around and walked back to her and asked what was up.  She'd miscarried in her chair and was bleeding and didn't know what to do.  I cleared the entire cube farm - something like 100 people, had an ambulance in no lights, no siren and had her quietly take to the hospital. Chair was immediately removed and her cube thoroughly cleaned up.  Only then was staff allowed back on the floor. This was not something I was happy about learning about after she'd miscarried.

I know that you have lots of appointments and make sure to  allow latitude to go to them.

I know that I will send you flowers (actually the company pays) when you give birth.

I know that you may disappear in the event of emergency (and will tell you when you tell me that you are pregnant I will tell you deal with you and the child first and let me know much later) and will not start separating you from the company.

I will start partnering someone with you right away if you work on long term projects - that way we do not scramble for projects that may involve you during maternity leave or if you have to be out of office prior to delivery.

I will enforce, re-enforce and make sure that you go away and stay away during maternity leave.  I will not tolerate you coming back early.

I will feed you chocolate when you are having a 'moment' (it happens).

Edit: I will also put you on no travel as soon as I find out.  "
"Being sweaty from working out. Gross, but fuck me."
I have a friend who has pretended for years that she believes outer space isn't real. Her boyfriend knows she's joking but she'll never actually admit it and he gets frustrated enough that he will leave the table. It's hilarious.
"""Oh, you have depression? Here are a list of things you should do that depression makes it nearly impossible to do!""

Yes, I know that exercising and getting out more and establishing a better sleep schedule could help. But my depression is the reason I'm not doing those things. "
"When I was bartending, I told my managers right away--like, before I started telling family. This was because the first trimester symptoms were *awful* and I was going to need some accommodation re: using the ""guest"" bathrooms nearby to puke and taking frequent snack breaks. I told my General Manager first because she's a woman who has had kids and would know what ""I'm seven weeks pregnant"" implied. I just asked if I could chat with her briefly during a slow lunch one day.

Just this summer I had a summer internship I was hoping would lead to a full time job and was pregnant the whole time. I began at 12 weeks and ended at 24 weeks. I waited until the last day, and even then not until they made me an offer for the full time position. That went something like this:

Boss: ""We loved you! Here's an offer! Think it over okay? We'd love it if you started in January after you graduate!""  
Me, panicked: ""I CAN'T START IN JANUARY I'M HAVING A BABY IN DECEMBER!... Could I start late-March?""  
Boss: ""That's amazing! Congratulations! Of course you can't start in January, that'd be madness. If you choose to accept the offer we would love to have you start whenever you're ready."""
"Absolutely and a good deal of that can be contributed to fully embracing the ""Zero fucks given"" philosophy. At 49, I literally give zero fucks about what anyone else thinks of me, and I feel much better about myself now than I did in my 20's and 30's. It's liberating. "
"Pineapple. 

Fight me. "
"When men do ""feminine"" things, like wear certain colors or randomly use a women's product. I once started going out with a guy basically because he had a pink cell phone. To me, it just seems really cool and projects a lot of confidence. Maybe it's also a kind of familiarity with/acceptance of femininity that feels like an acceptance of me (a woman!). Nothing is more off-putting to me than a guy who has to constantly prove his manliness; those men doth protest too much..."
"WE DO NOT MAKE SANDWICHES DIRECTLY ON THE COUNTER.  ESPECIALLY WHEN *SOMEONE* DOESN'T CLEAN UP THE CRUMBS.

He sees no point in making the sandwich on a plate if the counter is already clean.  7 years together and this argument continues."
I keep asking my SO whether his dick floats in the bath and he won't do any experiments to give me a conclusive answer which is annoying because he's a legit scientist and I should be able to count on him for scientific inquiries.
"'You'll change your mind (dear)'

Nope. I'm 37 years old and **I'm NOT having a kid**."
whether or not he actually answered me when I asked him a question. He answers me in his head but he *thinks* he answered me out loud. NO YOU DIDN'T AND ONE OF THESE DAYS I WILL SET UP A VIDEO CAMERA TO **PROVE IT**
You SORT your goddamned spoons into soup spoons and teaspoons in the drawer so that in a spoon emergency you can shave off VITAL seconds! How is that even a QUESTION?!
My family thinks that I have a life. That I don't sit alone in this apartment every day after work and every weekend. I just let them think that. 
"My husband regularly surprises me with different date ideas. 

Once we went pretend furniture shopping for our new house--he bought us a set up cheap wedding bands to really play the part. 

Another favorite would be the time he had us dress like super cheesy tourists and we went to the popular tourist spots in our city. 

He's pretty awesome. "
The only thing I want unsolicited pics of is puppies (alive ones.) I just don't want to see random body parts.
"We have different ideas about what constitutes 'needing to buy more.'

"Once a day. I have really oily hair. I've tried leaving it as long as I can to let it get used to infrequent washes but it gets so disgusting I lie awake feeling like there's stuff crawling on my head. So, every day it is. "
"There's an old proverb: marry in haste, repent at leisure. It's embarrassing when old grandma proverbs come true in your own life. If we hadn't gotten engaged too soon (less than six months after we started dating) it would have fallen apart after a year or two. I stayed in the marriage long after I was over it out of guilt, a misguided attempt to honor a commitment, inertia, and fear of being alone. I moved cities several times for his career until he asked me to make a move I just couldn't. "
He is the type I didn't know I had.
"I have dealt with this. Best thing to keep in mind: Don't fall in love with someone's *potential* - because that's when you end up waiting and thinking the situation is going to improve significantly if ___ happens; meanwhile it never happens.

"Lots of hanging out and talking, getting to know each other on a good level. Eventually, we slowly started going to dinner together and then going out to do things together. We got stuck in that period for a little while. It was like we were dating but there was no physical aspect to our relationship. I knew I liked him pretty soon after we started going out, but wasn't sure about his feelings for me. One day, I had him over to watch movies and hang out. I fell asleep with my head on his shoulder, woke up with his arms around me, and the rest is history. Each phase always felt very natural and I think it evolved well. "

"It's not for you. It's for them.

"I'm a horse trainer, both my pregnancies the first sign was my horses/client horses all started acting weird around me like a week before my missed period.

"My cat has decided that her breakfast is to be served right at 8 am, including on weekends/days off. If I don't get up to give her breakfast, she will step all over me while meowing loudly and sticking her face in mine.

I can expect to get ""yelled at"" (meowed at loudly and forcefully) if I'm out of the house for too long.

My pillow is actually her pillow. I go to sleep with my head on it, but often I wake up in the middle of the night with my head next to my pillow and she's sprawled out on it.

EDIT: She also has to be in the bathroom with me whenever I go. She watches me use the toilet and take a shower like it's a TV show. But God forbid I glance at her while she's using the litter box; she freezes and gives me a look like ""DO YOU MIND???"""

Hey...cornhole...I don't smile a lot because I don't feel a particular need to have a saccharin derp on my face in order to make you feel good about your day. If I have a neutral look on my face, that means either leave me alone or give me a million dollars.

Don't wanna give me a million bucks?  Great, then leave me the fuck alone. Telling me to smile is the longest route to actually getting me to smile."

"I got married at 19 and was very religious. When he was unfaithful, I looked for ways to be a better wife and better partner. After I made new friends and religion stopped being a focal point in my life, I began to question my marriage. I stopped blaming myself for his constant infidelity and abusive behaviors. We were married for twelve years.

"Not me, but my mom did so I've seen the situation play out my whole life. She has since had a very easy life: stay at home mom, big house, lots of vacations, constant shopping. But I can tell she is not happy and feels trapped. She doesn't work so she doesn't have much to do. Most days she just stays at home and watches TV or goes shopping. She depends on my dad for almost all practical things like financial stuff, house maintenance, even just driving most places. She wouldn't get by for long without him, but she doesn't love whim or really enjoy being with him. I don't know if she regrets it. Before she married my dad she worked very hard for little money and most likely would have continued that way which also is not ideal."

"I have had one, he was death row inmate.


I was interested to hear about his story and we became penpal. He was in Texas death row. Got executed on his birthday too. I think he was 28 then. 


It was...the same with any other penpals. You swap stories, telling jokes, he talked quite a bit about Jesus which could get a bit tedious, but whatever helped him sleeps at night guess.


Ultimately he was just one of the many statistics of losing birth lottery big time. Dad not in the picture, mom meth addict, joining gang as soon as able, robbing a house and shot two people. Killing a man. Going to death row and got executed. 


**Edit**: Nothing romantic ever going on. He was resigned to death and just want to reap Jesus karma as much as possible by reading and quoting bible. I was just interested in his stories. we have never exchanged pics or money too. Literally just handwritten letters."

"Unlike a lot of people in this thread, I've absolutely known TRP-type dudes who kept it pretty quiet. I don't know if I just had really bad judgement or what, but over a period of a few years in my early 20s I had three or four guy friends who, after a few months of knowing them, would reveal themselves to have absolutely insane ideas about women and sex and ""manliness."" There was one guy who I'd been (I thought) pretty good friends with for a YEAR who one day emailed me out of the blue to say basically ""I'm sure you're not busy but I am, I'm making tons of money and you're not, so how about you come to my place and I'll give you $40 for a blowjob."" Then there were the dudes who just casually commented that if their girlfriend got attacked and sexually assaulted it would be an immediate breakup, because the fact that she survived the attack must mean she didn't fight back hard enough and probably wanted it. Oh and then guy who I kind of had the hots for until he told me that if he was ever held up at gunpoint, he'd literally rather die than hand over his wallet because ""a real man never surrenders.""

So I guess I'm not specifically worried about secret TRP dudes, but I'm just generally more aware of the fact that some normal-seeming people are in fact total lunatics. "
"NO I DO NOT WANT MY OWN GLASS OF WHISKEY I ONLY WANT A FEW SIPS AND IT TASTES BETTER WHEN I'M STEALING FROM YOU ANYWAY. ALSO THERE ARE FEWER DISHES AFTER SO I AM REALLY BEING SELFLESS.

How you don't use soap IN your vagina. A pair of dudes argued with me for like 15 to 20 minutes saying I was wrong.
"My SO had never cleaned pretty much anything before we moved in together and his first time mopping the floor he used dish soap. For a week our chairs would slide away from the table whenever we sat to eat.

Edit: Also the other day we bought a drying rack for clothes (to save money running the dryer) and he was really weird about it. I just kinda brushed it off as him being hungry or something. We were doing laundry later that day and I started hanging clothes on it and he stopped me and asked me why we were doing this and how they were going to dry without mildewing. I was just so confused about where I lost him, how he came to be a twenty-seven year old man who didn't know that clothes can hang dry, and why he totally approved of buying a fifteen dollar Ikea drying rack if he didn't think you could hang clothes to dry."
"You sound like a pretty great boss! Especially with that sudden miscarriage, there's no way I would have been able to handle it that smoothly."
Nails in lesbian porn. Not everyone likes getting fingered by knives.
"How the lunch containers/measuring cups/plastic cups etc should be positioned after washing them. I think they should be open side DOWN so the water can drip out, he thinks they should be open side UP so they get air.

"I was going to make a joke about how it was how redpillers see any woman born after the Pink Floyd album was released (about 35 years ago) was essentially dogfood, but decided to check first.

Christ, ""The Wall"" is when any woman hits *25*, not 35. Any woman after 25 is apparently past prime, which is - in the timeless words of redpill philosophers, when they women are said to ""get get off the cock carousel and look for a provider"" -  ""after 25 they start to show more age-related wear-and-tear.""

And naturally, ""The male wall is when a guy is 95, dragging an oxygen tank around, and hasn't felt a sensation in his loins for the past 15 years.""

Every time I want to joke about TRPers, they prove themselves even more ridiculous than the joke."

"We actually first bonded over the fact that our then-significant-others were terrible. We would have coffee and talk about the shitty things they had done to us. Eventually we both just kind of phased them out (technically that guy and I never really broke up, we just kind of mutually ghosted?) and started spending more time together. It was autumn so we started watching horror movies together and scary movies + darkness = eternal love apparently because we're getting married next month!"

It's crazy how much their behavior changes though!  My first pregnancy I was working the bronc and the other trainer, an old cowboy, stopped and watched a minute then asked if I was pregnant.  I laughed him off but went home and took a test and sure enough I was!  With the second I was holding my batshit crazy mare for the chiropractor and we were laughing about how sweet she was being, nuzzling my belly and sighing a lot...  And the lightbulb went off for me.  Positive test again."
"Say, ""Oh, thanks..."" and take it.  I don't feel like getting in an argument with someone controlling the car I'm a passenger in.

However I would (neutrally) mention it in a review.  People who would be uncomfortable with that deserve to know &amp; be able to choose a different driver if they want.  Similarly, it may be a positive thing for some people and they can make a decision based on that too.  The ride didn't have to be religiously charged, but the driver made that choice by putting it out there in the first place.  Others deserve to know."
"I'd been with him for about two and a half years. We had plenty of issues- he was too busy to spend a lot of time with me, we had very different personalities and values, blah blah. But I cared about him a lot and didn't want to end it. 

We went out for my 21st birthday to have dinner, and he asked me what my future plans were. I said I wanted to have adventures, to have an interesting life. His reply was,

""You won't."" 

That was the moment I knew I'd break up with him. 

In retrospect, I really wish I could have told him that I'd spend my next few birthdays in Buenos Aires, a camel trek through the Sahara desert, and camping in the Colombian rainforest with a hot British dude. "
He is wrong and that is gross.
"I divorced after 19 years of marriage.  I figure that the first ten years seemed pretty good, the cracks started showing up in the next five, we tried to work on it for 3, and then we spent a year divorcing, more or less.  

What happened?  He was a military guy and a scientist, and his life experiences led him more and more to believe that there was a right way to do everything, and one just had to do the research, find out what that one way was, and do it -- and that the right answer was the same for everyone.  I, on the other hand, was a grad student in the social sciences, and had friends with a wide range of lifestyles; I became more and more convinced that there were many different ways to do things, and that one needed to experiment, to figure out what worked for you as an individual, to negotiate with those around you, and to craft a unique path through life.  Those two opinions and approaches toward life didn't work so well together.  

Over time, he got more and more critical and controlling, and while I'm pretty easy-going, it resulted in first my depression and then fights as I tried to push back.  In retrospect, I recognize that it was a fairly emotionally abusive relationship, though I had no idea at the time.  "
"Furiously poking the clit like it's a button on on arcade game? Don't do that.

"The constant recommendation to ""be yourself"" is only good if you're not an asshole. Sometimes it takes a difficult event to get people to realize that they need to make a change.

"&gt; General sexism and low key misogyny is all over reddit though, and I do think those views are more common than boys generally let on.

This is why I have a hard time reading the comment section in 80% of reddit. 

I think sexism just like racism are not so black and white (sexist vs not sexist) it is unfortunately a spectrum, I agree that most people hold some form of sexist views or opinions without noticing.

"My sister did. The marriage lasted 12 years and two kids before she went batshit insane, Gone Girl style and ran away to a homeless shelter pretending she was being abused (she later admitted she never was). The reason for her deceit - our state automatically applies 50/50 custody in a standard divorce, unless there's been abuse. So she got default full custody which meant she got the highest bracket of child support payments. She kept the kids away from the father 6 months with a restraining order until he caved to all of her conditions and she got to keep her house, car, vacation home and still get paid all sorts of money from him to maintain the kids lifestyle: "
"So I guess I'm a bit different from most users, but I met my husband on OKCupid :)

Just be prepared to get a bunch of creeper messages and potentially go on a LOT of potentially bad first dates. My advice is to just message people who seem interesting, and after a few very brief exchanges, go out for a coffee or drink ASAP. If you don't like him or it's not a good fit, just don't go out again. It's one quick date and not a bunch of time invested in someone who turns out to be disappointing. Most people I know who didn't like online dating did the email/messaging thing for WAY too long before they finally met in person and realized they weren't a good match. I approached it as just a way to introduce me to potentially new people I wouldn't have met elsewhere, not as a replacement for the first date.

Feel free to PM with specific questions! :)"

"The best dates are honestly the ones I don't have to plan. I love it when he takes initiative. He likes Burlesque shows and I had never been so we went to a local distillery and had some drinks, got burgers, and then went to the show. It was great. 

Second best date was a long weekend backpacking trip together. It started pouring rain 8 miles in so we set up camp. Then we were up all night because the wind was ripping through the valley, upwards of 60mph gusts. The next day we had to bushwhack 10 miles in the cold, wind, and rain. We ended up walking down a creek with thigh-deep water because it was *easier.* When we finally got back to the truck, we split a whole beef summer sausage and block of cheese. True love. "
"""Oh we're getting married platonically, we're just really close friends. Really really close."""
"""What's he going to do to me if I say no?"" is a concern I have way too often, and it's a common one from my conversations with other women.

No, I don't want to give you my number. No, I don't want to dance. No, I don't want to smile. No, I don't want to have a conversation with you in this grocery store/gas station/library/coffee shop. No, do not whistle at me like a dog. No, I do not appreciate your lewd comments. No, do not touch me without my permission. No, I don't want to date you. No, I don't reciprocate your feelings. No, I don't want to have sex with you. No, do not show me your penis. No, do not follow me. No, I will not send you a picture. No, I do not want to see you any more. No, no, no, no. 

Women are mutilated and stalked and harassed and killed and assaulted and verbally abused daily for saying no. There are news stories about acid being thrown in women's faces for denying men, about teenage girls being shot for saying no to homecoming and prom invitations, murder-suicides as a response to separations and divorces, mass shootings based on feelings of rejection. It's the goddamn plague of our gender. "
"In my experience, if someone pulls the ""I'm not looking for anything serious"" shit, *believe them*. Don't get too invested. "
"In hindsight - from the very beginning there were so many signs that we were not compatible. We couldn't even agree on music to listen to in the car - I hated his music, he hated mine. I liked to go to clubs and go dancing, he wanted to go to heavy metal shows. I wanted to meet his friends and family, he didn't want me involved with them. 

But we clung to each other in a really co-dependent fashion for many, many years. The sex stopped 2 years into the almost 10 year relationship. Got married at year 7-8ish because he needed health insurance, and I was even bitter about how all of that went down. The past 2 years, it got worse... I picked up multiple jobs to send him to college. He wasn't working for most of the relationship. He GPS tracked my phone to a restaurant I told him I was going to with girls from work one night and sat outside the restaurant and called inside the hostess to make sure I was in there. We had a mutual married couple friends - the wife of that couple and I went to dinner. He texted her while we were at dinner to make sure I was actually there with her.... The final straw was when he locked in a room for several hours because I locked the bathroom door when I was in the shower. He was mad at me for locking the bathroom door while I was in there --- so he locked in me in the bedroom until I could break the lock off the door and get out. 

I was terrified, and spooked and should have called the police. I didn't want to get him in trouble, I just wanted out so I didn't. It wasn't healthy. We weren't helping each other grow, we were stunting each other. So, about 2 weeks after he locked me in the room, I grew the balls to tell him I wanted to move out.

 I don't know how he is doing - he is taking me to court for spousal support instead of signing the agreement that he initially agreed to that was sent to him.... 

My bills are so high, I will likely have to file for bankruptcy and leave my job, walk out on my lease and my whole life to move somewhere cheaper. I cannot afford to give him 50% of my income -- I just don't have that kind of money to keep myself afloat... I'm terrified. 

That being said - ending the relationship is something that should have been done many years ago, I regret signing the marriage license deeply and feel like I cheated myself out of something real to accommodate something unhealthy. 

I am much happier now - I have friends again, I go out and enjoy life. I go to concerts, I date people... I sleep better, I feel like myself again and I haven't felt this great in many, many years. "

"My husband and I met in high school when he moved to my (now our) hometown the second half of our sophomore year.

We had every class together for the next 2 1/2 years (very small hometown...350 people in our graduating class) and became best friends.

We both had other relationships.

I think I started questioning the platonic-ness of our interaction about 2 years in and after his girlfriend moved away, we started talking about this.

I broke up with my boyfriend and we started dating the summer we graduated from high school and dated the first 1 1/2 of college.

We broke up and dated other people but still remained friends through college.

We kept having ""missed connections"" during this time.  One of us would be interested in getting back together but the other would be dating someone else.

Finally, someone else asked me to marry them and my husband wasn't too happy about it.  He said he always assumed that I would just wait until he was ready.

My engagement (obviously) didn't work out (I caught him in the shower with someone else) and we got back together.

We have been married 32 years and friends for 41 years.

I think one thing that has always been a constant is that we enjoyed each others company and that we amuse each other.  

I think there is a lot to be said about having similar family backgrounds and education levels."

"we were best friends that basically went on dates that were just ''haha hanging out right we couldn't date totally''. over time i realized that he treated me better and i was more attracted to him than any of the guys i dated, but i wrote it off as hopeless because cute skinny guys aren't supposed to like fat older women. he'd surprise me by helping me put together my furniture after moving or buying me tickets to the opera i was dying to see. naaah, friends!

then we started cuddling ''platonically'' during hangouts, i would sleep over at his house ''platonically'', and one night instead of leaving me in the living room to sleep on the spare mattress, he brought the mattress from his bed so he could sleep next to me. it was the blatant sign i needed to just kiss the guy already and break up with the ''boyfriend'' who was giving me the string along. "
It's heavy with the weight of your sins.
this is the *perfect* example of mansplaining 
"""just ask him/her out!"" When it's someone they haven't really interacted with or they clearly don't get social cues.

No. If you don't take the time or make the effort to read someone's cues you're going to look like a fool. There's a reason the cues exist, why people flirt, why people give signals. It's to determine whether the other person is receptive to romantic advances. Not only that, those interactions give the person you're asking out a chance to get to know you, to possibly make them interested in going out with you. It's an important step and is completely ignored when you just ask someone out in a ""shoot from the hip"" manner. 

Like, I'm sure these people giving the advice don't just meet a person and the first thing out of there mouth is ""wanna go out with me?"" But that's what they're essentially advising others to do. And you might say, ""but Jonesie, obviously that's not what we mean."" And I respond that if a person is asking the question here, they need more than that. They're so inexperienced or socially inept that they need to ask here, they may very well take it as such. It's terrible advice to tell someone to just ask another person out without establishing that they understand the social dynamics of it."
What's up with guys who are married/in committed relationships hitting on women 'as a joke' at work? I have frequently been the recipient of things that I would consider cheating if I saw my husband doing them.
"All the things that can go wrong with your period/reproductive system. Most men seem to think we just get a period once a month, deal with it and that's it. Period cramps, irregular periods, bleeding in between periods and wondering if that means there's something wrong with you and you're gonna die, having to wonder if you're pregnant if your period doesn't start on time, dealing with birth control and its side effects...I've talked to some of my male friends about this stuff and while they're sympathetic, most of them just don't realize how much thought goes into it for some women.

"When a cake/cookie recipe calls for a flavoured extract and eggs, mix the extract in with the eggs, that way the extract is more evenly distributed in the batter."
My boyfriend is getting a little fat and I love it. 
"Make sure you read through the recipe before starting so you don't get to ""let the dough rise / let the meat marinate overnight"" halfway through.

It's also a good habit to get all the required ingredients out ahead of time, so you don't end up with ""shit, I needed 5 cans of black beans but I've only got 2 cans of pinto beans"" - plus it's easier to grab ingredients when they're already gathered in one place."
"Thank you and he *is* wrong.  I will use this as part of my evidence.  ""Someone on the internet also agrees that this is gross.""

"I feel a little weird telling my story because my SO and I do not have a traditional relationship, but I feel like some people might benefit from a non-heteronormative relationship story. 

When we met, I was still far enough in the closet to visit Narnia. I was dating the guy I'd been dating since high school, and I was miserable. We met online through a shared hobby and we hit it off instantly. We were both going through really difficult times in our lives and I think that had a lot to do with how we bonded with each other. For two years we talked every day and even though we were hundreds of miles apart, I considered her my best friend. 

During that time, I finally came to terms with my sexuality. I got some therapy, I left my boyfriend, and I realized that I was in love with my best friend. It was, unfortunately, unrequited. She told me that she loved me, but not romantically. She told me that she was asexual, which I had to google to understand. I told her that I didn't care and that it wasn't about sex, but she said a relationship wasn't possible. For a few terrifying weeks I was certain that I'd destroyed our friendship, but soon things were back to normal. Before that we'd always texted each other things like ""ILY"" and ""&lt;3"", but after that I was afraid to express much affection . I didn't want to make her uncomfortable. 

Another year or so passed and we'd both graduated from college. She'd moved back to her home state to live with her family and I was preparing to move to a new state to go to Graduate school. She was miserable and desperately wanted to move. I was terrified of living on my own in a new city, or worse, sharing an apartment with a stranger.

That's when I convinced her to move in with me. Sometimes I still can't believe she did it! I toured a little rental house on my own and sent her pictures. We hadn't even met in person yet, but she said yes. A few weeks later she flew down for our first face to face meeting and we toured the house together. I'd already signed the lease, but I was ready to find another roommate if things fell apart. It was awkward at first. It felt like talking with a stranger and someone I'd known forever at the same time. 

After a week she went home, packed everything she owned into her car and drove for days to get to our new home.

Because we'd already had that ""We're just friends"" talk, I tried to keep my distance emotionally and keep clear boundaries. I didn't want to chase her away. But the longer we lived together, the closer we grew. And I think she started to trust me more and to believe me when I said that I didn't need sex to be a part of my relationship. 

Things just sort of naturally fell into place after that. After graduate school we decided to move to a new city for a fresh start. We adopted a dog together and things started to feel a little more permanent. Our relationship had already grown into something more than just friendship, but I didn't have words to define it. We started telling each other things like ""I can't imagine life without you"" and ""I want to be with you forever"". I reassured her over and over again that I was happy, that I didn't want to be dating other people, that I didn't feel like anything was missing. We started holding hands. I stopped putting up walls against the emotional intimacy that I was afraid she didn't want. She admitted that she wanted more affection. In my ignorance, I had confused asexuality with aromanticism. We started talking about marriage. So what if our marriage doesn't look like other people's marriage, we finally decided. We're happy. We want to be together forever. We want a commitment and security. 

I've known that we were a couple for a few years now, but it was only this year that we started telling other people that we're together. That part of it still feels strange sometimes. It feels like coming out over and over and over. I think the hardest part is that sometimes it feels like we don't really fit in anywhere. Even in the LGBTQIA community there are people who don't believe that asexuality is a valid identity. And in the Lesbian community I encounter tons of women who don't think a relationship is valid without sex. It's like people can't imagine experiencing intimacy without sex, which is just so strange to me because I feel more intimate with my SO than I did with any of my sexual partners. 

So that's my ridiculously long story of how my best friend became my fiance.

"Having received this advice, I hear you. And FWIW, I do exercise regularly and I *still* struggle with depression so I get super annoyed when people act like it's a cure-all. It definitely has helped me a lot, but it's not helped me get fully better. "

my SO, for example, is across the country working, and i rarely ever miss him. same with my sister in my home country. it's nice to not have to deal with unpleasantness of missing someone and just get on with life.. but i feel terrible and ungenuine and like i don't love at all for not being capable of it. i don't have any feelings for people who i haven't seen in years, so even if i did actually love my mother, telling her so would be a lie.

from what i can tell, it's some weird manifestation of my personal cluster of PTSD/dissociative symptoms. i never had a stable caretaker as a baby, so my coping method might have been to just to stop stressing over object constancy and forget them if they weren't in front of me. it's not seperation anxiety, it's ''welp they're gone, possibly forever, might as well try to move on now''."

"I was five weeks pregnant. I thought my boss and I were friends as the company consisted of seven of us and we seemed to all be very close. She told me I could always have an abortion and be a mom at a later stage in life (I'm 26). When I confirmed that I was in fact keeping my baby she rolled her eyes and said I should've gotten an abortion. 

My experience wasn't nice. I hope yours is. "
"I don't know for a fact, but I assume that my biological mother could likely have more children, a spouse, a good life, etc. I may have blood siblings 10 years or more younger than me. She may have married my biological father and living the high school sweetheart romance. 

She may not, but based on the tiny bit I know of my biological family, it's likely she was at least afforded the opportunity for higher education, and a chance to grow and flourish after having me. 

Here's what I do know....

At the time in her life that I was born, she was 16. 

She and her family chose to put me up for adoption instead of trying to raise me. Had she kept me, her opportunities may not have been as open. She was likely able to finish high school and go on to college. She was able to continue focusing on her growth and development instead of mine. She got to be a kid. Maybe she made some mistakes, and maybe she learned some valuable lessons. She was able to at least try at having her own future.

She gave me a future first though. She chose my adoptive parents from papers, and agency information, and her heart.  She gave my parents the opportunity at the future they wanted. She gave them me, and she gave me them. 

She made a choice to carry me, then went through labor and delivery, she held me and named me. And then she gave me the best chance she possibly could, knowing she was not it. 

I got to play outside until the streetlights came on, I got to date the cute boy in my home room, I got to play music and take dance, I got to go to college. I got to meet my husband and travel and love and lose. I got to have my son....the first blood relative I've ever known.  

My birth mother gave me all this. She may not have known exactly how things would pan out, but she knew my life could be more. She wanted it to be more than she could offer, at that time. 

And it's been amazing. 

I hope she has more children now, if she chose to. I hope she's gotten to experience the opportunities and life that she did her best to ensure I would have. 

She gave me an incredible life, even though it wasn't with her. And I hope beyond anything that her absolute gift to me and my family afforded her every bit of opportunity at happiness and a future full of love.

I hope that for you too."

"I was in an abusive marriage for over 20 years. The abuse started of very small and subtle, and slowly increased over the years until it became the norm. There are a lot of reasons I stayed, most of which are common among abuse victims, so I won't go into detail. 

I knew that I wasn't happy, but my real wake up call was when he started emotionally and verbally abusing our son. I also realized that he was not a fit role model for him, for a **lot** of reasons.

He had threatened to divorce me pretty regularly over the years, as a control tactic. I have a painful degenerative spinal disability, so I relied on him for healthcare insurance and income.  He didn't actually want to divorce me, but he knew that threatening to leave was a great way to scare me back into submission so I'd stay to take his abuse.  After I was diagnosed, about 13 years in, he ramped up his abuse (and started cheating on me, which I didn't discover until after I filed for divorce). He knew he had a captive, and our marriage eventually became an unofficial estrangement. He provided healthcare insurance and basic living expenses, I took care of his house, our son, and every single other responsibility while he regularly spent us into the red by pissing away money on trying to impress his friends &amp; family, his expensive hobbies, and his extra-marital activities.  He made over 70K a year, but it was frequently a struggle for me just to keep the utilities paid up.

Anyway, after my epiphany about our son, I finally called his bluff. He really didn't like that!  It took away his favorite control tactic, and he actually thought that heaping on *more* abuse would somehow make me stay! It was ugly and eye-opening, and I knew there was no going back.

It was definitely the right decision. I only wish I'd done it sooner.

"Yes! I was 16 and getting my drivers license when a group of boys from the local penitentiary strolled in. One immediately came and sat down right next to me. We started chatting, he was very sweet as I assumed all young players are. He asked me for my address to send me letters. He was handsome and I was young so I said yes but didn't really expect much.

He sent me the sweetest letters, asked me all these questions and told me about his life before being sent away. We never mentioned what he 'did' but I doubted it was violent. He spoke kindly and seemed to be starving for human interaction outside of his sad reality.  

We wrote each other for weeks, it was a huge secret on my part. My mother found my stash of letters, freaked out ripped them up and proceeded to monitor the mail religiously so I would never receive another letter from him again. He kept writing too. 

It was heartbreaking. I think about him from time to time, just wondering what became of him."

"Me too. It's actually a very good indicator. There's a reason why it's a cliche - it works.

Earlier in my relationship, my boyfriend and I went out with friends to Buffalo Wing Wings (sports bar) to watch UFC. Our waitress was really nice to all of us. Part way through, my boyfriend nudged me and said ""Look at her forearms discreetly when she comes back"". I did. I didn't notice before but then I could see what he saw: she had very deep scars that were characteristic of a past cutter, some keloided, and she had them down both of her arms. She was wearing a t-shirt so it was actually pretty obvious...I probably didn't notice earlier because I had been drinking.

My boyfriend leaned over to me and whispered ""I hope she is feeling better. I want to give her a really good tip and tell her that she took good care of us so she will feel good about herself."" And he did.

That, plus other things, really opened my eyes to the kind of person that he is."

"I think actual scientists who study evolutionary psychology don't use their theories or findings as justifications for behaviors, just explanations for why those behaviors might exist.

The problem is when people equate what is ""natural"" (human traits that might have been adaptive in prehistoric times) with what is good or right. Anyone who makes that leap isn't making a scientific claim, they're making a normative claim. That normative claim isn't very compelling, especially if the best argument that can be mustered for it isn't intrinsic to the claim, but instead some nonsensical argument about what is 'natural.'

There is a book called *Moral Tribes* by Joshua Greene that I this is a great example of *appropriately* using the findings of evo psych in an ethical argument. Greene has a Ph.D. in psychology and is a professor at Harvard. His basic premise is that humans were evolutionarily selected to favor 'us' over 'me' (which is great) but also to favor 'us' over 'them' (which is awful). The whole purpose of the book is to figure out how we can *overcome* our natural inclinations in order to build a better society, rather than basing our cultural norms on essentially irrelevant evolutionary history."

"Honestly, I started by reading some e-books on divorce, etc. 

My ex and I did cooperative divorce.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  The divorce itself is **just** a financial transaction - who gets what .....   It is the emotional components that give lawyers the big fees.

"I had heartburn (which I never have), and noticed it hurt my boobs when I slept on my stomach. I thought it was all in my head, because we had been trying for 2.5 years so obviously it was just wishful thinking. Then next day at work I must have peed fifteen times. At that point, I just knew. I even sat at my desk and made up a cute little sign with my due date to put with the test I was going to take when I got home. Drove home, took the test, sure enough! I was 3 weeks 5 days at that point. "
"All the ladies of Avatar: The Last Airbender. Take Katarra, who is one of the only female characters who is a complete badass and will fuck you right up but is also mothering and nurturing and feminine and compassionate. So many ~Strong Female Characters~ are tough, angry tomboys who must never remind the audience that they are female. But Katarra's compassion and kindness are shown as strengths, not weaknesses, over and over again. She is allowed to be feminine and strong at the same time, because those two things aren't a contradiction, and I love it.

No, it's not appropriate to ever comment on a random persons weight, appearance, clothing choices, etc. I don't know why, but I've met so many dudes who think it's completely acceptable to comment on the appearance of others. I was on a date with a guy who was doing it literally all night. ""Oh god, did you see what she was wearing, she should try putting some clothes on what a slut"" and sarcastically saying ""Look at big mama over there with her stomach hanging over her pants, mmm"" or ""Oh god did you see that girls feet?

"Tldr - Had enough of playing romance and decided to settle down with some financial security.  Decided on what type of rich, networking made leads, followed up.  Worked on teaching relationship skills to a non boytoy material guy for a while until he was a decent companion and married him.  Happy with good husband and father to kid.

When you're goal oriented you make your own future.  Romance is fun, and it helped me figure out what I liked and what I couldn't go with.  But as exciting as it is, love at first sight or being swept off your feet is a terrible way to make plans.  Culturally I am not bound by western ideas of a marriage of soulmates or a god/destiny fulfillment thing. It's about making the strongest household you can, and money certainly makes that easier.

As grad school was wrapping up I got serious (no more fooling around with the hot sex idiot or dating guys that just felt comfortable). I was out on rotation in my final year and I was always networking.  Being good with strangers is part of my work and on top of that I got good at sizing up a social network, figuring out who that keystone person who introduces you to more people and expanding.  Eventually you hear gossip, this person has a trust fund, that person was pre IPO, and it's not always obvious.  I wanted someone careful, earlier I dated men who spent frivolously (fun for me) who tended to be irresponsible.  Not something I wanted in a partner.  I also didn't want anyone too ambitious (since they needed to have time for me) not someone who would be dedicating time to business rather than his kids.  

I'm deeply satisfied and in my second year of marriage. I evaluated a lot of people and was even offered as a match by Selective Search (he was nice enough but I thought I could do better).  I'm married to someone I would have probably not noticed before I decided to settle down.  He's handsome but aggressively shy, his wealth is not obvious, I was clued in by his friend who was trying to hook him up (and then someone I knew at his company looked up his employee number to confirm) and he's pretty much the best father ever.  I'm trying hard not to sound smug but I worked hard and damn I deserve this.  

Love came after the work of teaching him to communicate, we were dating for a while, started living together and got married about three years from meeting.  The first year from meeting him I was pretty much just holding on and fighting the urge to break up by peeking at his mint balance and reminding myself that he was a work in progress.  He was really bad at knowing what he was feeling/communicating that, let alone my feelings.  I had to learn soooo much patience.  By the time we started living together things were ok, comfortable.  By the time we were married he was a lot more confident and I was I into him as much as other less mercenary relationships.  The most in love I've ever been is now.  Having a baby and the shared experiences accumulating as we travel and whatnot brings us closer daily.

Edit :  I shared this because I'm in a stable loving relationship   and wish others would think a bit more before making what is essentially the biggest financial decision of their lives.  You wouldn't be making business decisions based on your mood.  Divorce sucks."

"I married my first husband at 21 years old after 8 months of dating. We only began dating because he told me that my boyfriend of four years was cheating on me. Story checked out and I guess I went out with him to get back at my boyfriend (they were best friends). It was obviously a mess and all very cringeworthy. 

I didn't love him but didn't realize that in my young age. What I loved was positive attention from a male. He was a hopeless romantic at the time and was in love with the idea of love - but not in love with me. He didn't even want to sleep with me on our week-long honeymoon. 

Fast forward one year and I had a miscarriage at around 6 weeks. It revealed some underlying medical issues and I needed quite a bit of medical attention at the time - he never once exhibited any caring or accompanied me to doctor appointments or urgent care visits - my parents did. About two months before this, I had an interview scheduled with a local airline for a flight attendant position. The day of the interview he became extremely unreasonable about how he was going to get to work/school (he worked at the university he was also attending as a student). Normally he would drive his car but that day he was adamant that he did not want to do that and I needed to drive him. He made me miss my interview. If you miss a flight crew interview, you are not eligible to reinterview for six months. Flight crew was my dream job and I had previously been a flight attendant but took a different job when fuel prices soared causing flight hours to diminish (I had only been getting like 15 hours a month) - and this was my chance to get back to the job I loved.

Fast forward four more years and he had a nervous breakdown and had to be committed to an inpatient psych program for a full month. To have him committed required doing a 3-party commitment that included myself and his mother and another party. He was a danger to everyone. He had managed to get two restraining orders against him from two different employers in the matter of three days' time. He was having delusions, hearing voices, getting messages from media, etc... I didn't have any experience with this type of thing and was scared. Anyhow, even after being medicated and coming down from his severe mania, he never forgave me for having him committed. 

After that episode, I felt guilty and like I needed to stay to take care of him because he wasn't taking care of himself.  Two years later we bought a house - kind of the same rationale was used as people who have a baby to try to save a marriage. It was lunacy but the house did provide a good distraction for me from the marriage. During this time, I got a dog for myself. My husband and I weren't sleeping in the same room and when he would walk past my bedroom door to go to his room, my dog would growl at him. WTF? That dog loved me more than anything and was protective of me, but never exhibited that kind of behavior toward anyone else who was ever in our house - friends and family. That made wonder what it was about him that upset her so much.

Anyhow, I had wanted to go back to school to finish my degree that I put on hold when we got married. He had finished his and we were in a position that should have allowed me to quit working full-time to focus on school full-time. Well, immediately after I received my acceptance letter, he applied to grad school at an online university and got in - and only just told me when he was accepted. We couldn't both afford to go to school - especially with how expensive grad school is. He wouldn't budge, so I had to forgo school at that point. Whatever. One day he was writing a final paper and I was terribly sick with food poisoning. I had slept downstairs on the couch and was so nauseated that I was having a hard time getting up the stairs to get to my bedroom. I called out for him to please help me get up and he came out of his office and yelled at me that I ""was lucky"" to only be sick and I had no idea what he was up against having to write a final paper. Screamed at me is a more apt description.

One weekend we had a couple of friends from out of town come and stay with us and he never left his office the entire time - playing video games - to socialize or anything. When he came out to get a snack, he found it appropriate to tell them that he wouldn't be bothered if I had an affair. What?! Why would something like that ever come out of someone's mouth? It didn't fit with the conversation we were having or anything. 

That was the final straw. There had been hundreds of issues over the years and I always just stayed because I felt like I owed it to take care of him. He didn't want to take his medicine and wouldn't unless I made him. I felt like it was my responsibility to make him take it. I finally realized that it wasn't doing either of us any good for me to mother him. My life was a shadow of what it could be and he needed to be able to be his own person. 

At the divorce hearing, I found out about his credit card debt. Nearly $100K of credit card debt that had been hidden from me. And for those who don't understand how credit card debt can be hidden, two words: online statements. All of that debt was spent on webcam girls. He didn't want to have sex with his wife, but quite liked webcam girls. Talk about adding insult to injury. We were married for 10 years. What a waste of time and energy."

I think about it, but I have no family or friends I can easily go to thanks to too many interstate moves and I literally can't even think of what I should do as Step 1. Do you just go and rent a house first? Get your own bank account? How do you tell them?

Now he rants and raves to anyone that will listen about all the girly bath products I buy him. His favorite is when I go to LUSH or try new etsy stores. Some of my friends even made him bath bombs for christmas to pick on him. Didn't work, he used those dreamsicle bath bombs with pride.

Put it this way. I cannot imagine a person of healthy self-esteem thinking an unsolicited dick pic is a good move.

Contrary to widely spread belief, negging is not their only move. The idea that a twerp can't pay lip service to you while inwardly seething and calling you a whore just because ""all twerps r angry&amp;dum"" is a little ridiculous.

Wonderful ladies.  
  
But I also know older ladies who are clearly very insecure. They act cocky, gossip all the time, never have a nice word to spare. Typical traits of an insecure person. Always seeking validation.

&gt; Men solely carry the burden of being responsible for dating

This is not 1950. Women ask men out. Most relationships I know of that have started IRL happen after a mutual pursuit of one another. Also, lesbian and bisexual women exist. Who carries the ""burden"" then? You seem to exclusively be referring to stranger-approaches between heterosexual couples, which is just not how things commonly happen any more. 

&gt; If a woman makes no effort, as is the case for most women, they will have no trouble finding a date or relationship.

a.) Plain women exist. Ugly women exist. More women don't fit the bill for being conventionally desirable than do - you just don't pay attention to them. These women have plenty of trouble in the dating world. 

b.) Even assuming that most women don't participate in starting relationships, which I've already expressed is very against my lived experiences, we are expected to put a LOT of effort into our physical appearances and the emotional flourishing of our romantic partnerships. 

c.) Regardless of how attractive you are and how much effort you put in, finding a partner who respects you and is compatible with you is worlds different than finding a random man who is willing to put his penis in one of your holes.

&gt; if a man makes no effort, he dies alone. 

This is true of anyone. All relationships - romantic, friendly, familial - take effort. 

&gt; The life of a man is already a very isolated, depressing existence

Maybe this is true for some men, as it is of some women. I would argue that women tend to attack themselves and men tend to attack others, but I would also say EVERYONE should seek professional help if they feel this way. 

&gt; and if the person in question happens to be crazy,

I don't buy into the stigma of mental illness as a precursor to violence. In fact, the mentally ill are MASSIVELY more likely to be the victims of violence than perpetrators. I think perfectly sane people, when raised in a culture of toxic entitlement and misogyny, are capable of great damage if challenged or denied. 

So in short, I don't think your explanation accounts for most of what happens, but probably for some of it. I also think you need to move out of the headspace where women are all passive and universally attractive.

My next priority is to get bras that actually fit me. When I turned 20 I went from a C, gradually to a DD. So time for new bras. I just grew out of my D cups.

My last priority but still an important one is to save up for a new car and a really nice gift for my SO. I might put away like $10-$20 per paycheck into each of those things. I know it's not much....but it's something."

"I'm currently trying to decide if my boyfriend of 11 years and I should breakup and it's tearing me apart.  To be honest, the relationship isn't bad at all but it's...just not what I want maybe? We have very, very different interests.  I have changed a lot since we started dating in high school and we're both relatively poor communicators.  I think the final thing that made me realize what I'm missing is my friend who has a deep emotional connection with her boyfriend.  They're into the same stuff but have enough separate interests.  Currently deciding if I have a case of the grass is greener but I think I'm just not happy.  Sorry it's not quite what you were looking for!"
"Because of miscarriages.  Of the 50 or 60 pregnancies I've had on staff I know of at least 5 or so that ended very early due to miscarriage.  
 

One thing we found (we had a consulting physician on staff and he briefed senior management) was that there was frequently major emotional trauma in the aftermath that far outstripped the physical damage.  

As a result we would often put the person on a modified form of 'maternity leave' for a few weeks (after a miscarriage) and then phase back to full time (policy I implemented in my department initially and think was adopted bank wide after a couple of years). 

We found that doing this resulted in lower female staff turnover and minimized business impact."

"This sounds so cheesy, but honestly I've come to appreciate people's differences so much more than I did when I was younger. When I was younger it was all about fitting in and liking what my friend's liked and the whole group being equally into going to the same shows and parties and teams and clubs. Yeah *small* differences existed like playing different positions or insisting that the Misfits were superior to Bad Religion or whatever but everyone in my various groups were really into all the same things as everyone else in that group.

"A sum of not so little things. Basic incompatibilities and a significant enough loss of trust from a few instances that completely ruined my attraction and emotional presence in the relationship. The biggest one I can't let go of was when I fractured my elbow and he made me wait hours and hours to go to the hospital, and then refused to get my pain medication. I was in agony from the day of until the end of the next day (by the time I got the pain medicine it took forever to actually work). He actually got annoyed and gave me dirty looks while I was crying in pain like a baby. I ask myself, ""what kind of person does that?"". I still care about him but I became very detached and not at all physically attracted after that and several other emotionally abusive instances. It's pretty tough right now as we cohabit and need to move on and out but it's not mutual. "
"Hi! I went through a few rounds of chemo for an autoimmune disease when I was 16. It really sucks, but here are a few tips that helped me through. 

Be very intentional about the clothes/food/facewash etc. you use during treatment. Try to make sure that those items are things that you could live without after treatment. For instance, I used a grapefruit face wash and now, six years later, the scent of grapefruit makes me vomit.

Some people suggest eating a specific type of ice cream after, so that you associate that flavor with treatment, rather than ice cream as a whole. Or vary your schedule enough that your body doesn't associate anything with treatment. 
Also, I would recommend shaving your head as soon as your hair starts seriously falling out, it is much easier to manage that way. 

everyone handles chemo differently, so don't compare yourself to anyone in clinic for ""handling it better.""

"The one that stands out the most in my mind was a little bit after pokemon go came out. My boyfriend was a pokemon fanatic as a kid, and I'd never played it at all. We went grocery shopping, bought some pizza lunchables, megastuf golden oreos, and our favorite flavors of gatorade, and drove out to a park that we'd heard was good for catching pokemon. We had a picnic in the grass under 3 pokestops that were all constantly lured, and we just sat there for hours talking and catching pokemon. I was super excited because Eevees are my favorite pokemon and they kept spawning, and I finally got enough to make a Flareon! (Now, 2 months later, we finally caught our first Dragonites together!)

"I don't care for warm pineapple in general and I get salty about pineapple on pizza because of one incident at a party.

It was about 20 people, and the host asked what kind of pizza everyone wanted, and at least half the group said Hawaiian.  So they ordered 4 Hawaiian and 4 others.

When the pizza came, I was in the bathroom at the time and so ended up being one of the last people to be able to get some.  When I got there, what did I see?

Hawaiian.  Just Hawaiian.  All these fuckers that asked for Hawaiian didn't actually eat the god damn Hawaiian pizza.  No cheese pizza.  No pepperoni, meat lovers, supreme, or anything else.  The only thing left were three Hawaiian pizzas.

At that point, I decided that there's a bunch of people that only claim to like Hawaiian the most because it's ""cool"" to like it, but when actually offered whatever they want, they'll get something else.

So that's my story about why I give pineapple as a topping so much flak."

"It's often about wanting to feel desirable, even if it's just in a kind of feeble fantasy. I don't condone guys that force it on people at work or do things that aren't OK with their wives, but that's the basic psychology a lot of the time.

I've been in groups of 30something and 40something year old  married guys that want to go to places like Hooters because it's a place where they can relatively safely get a little flirting in because they're not feeling desired at home. They don't want to actually cheat or even go to something like a strip club, but they want the illusion of being able to attract an attractive young woman.

Other times it's just another way of asserting power over people that are helpless to prevent it, like many forms of harassment."

"So I really appreciate it when people try to add diversity to their works of fiction, by including characters that aren't like them.  But sometimes, you really kind of need to consider that you might not have the perspective to portray an experience other than your own, and that's totally a normal thing that happens and isn't something to be ashamed of, but it probably means that you should run your ideas by people what might relate more closely to that experience.

"Many, many people in the world don't see it as shameful. I like reading Chinese relationship advice columns, and at least half of the questions center around the man's salary and assets or his family's financial situation. Things like ""I love my fiance but his parents won't buy us a house, should I give up?""

One woman was sad that her boyfriend didn't appreciate her sentimental gifts and was too busy with work to be romantic. The advice columnist's response? ""It's good that he cares so much about making money to support his family. Wouldn't it be easier for you to just sit back and be in charge of looking pretty instead of bothering him?""

And men seem to be fine with being valued for their wealth. My boyfriend, who is ethnically Chinese, has been asked by Chinese/Hong Kong friends ""how to get a foreign girl."" They are used to local girls being interested in them as soon as they mention their job or education. They get confused when it doesn't work on foreigners. They are more comfortable attracting a woman by their professional achievements and resources than by making her laugh or whatever.

I don't think American women actually don't care about money, it's just not usually an explicit priority. Caring more about feelings and passion has pros and cons. But yeah, if you don't place importance on money when considering marriage, you actually might be in the minority."

* Safe baby surrender laws are time-limited. No, people can't drop off their 5-year-olds at the fire station with impunity (at least anywhere near where we live), and no, that's not a thing people commonly do. ""I saw it on _Law and Order_"" is not proof that it happens in the real world. 

* If your document has an image containing lots of text upside down for some godforsaken reason, you should definitely fix that. Yes, people will notice. 

* The City of Los Angeles is not in Orange County. This would be a much less embarrassing error if you hadn't lived in LA for a really long time.

"There was a guy I was friendly with in one of my university classes the semester that I was sexually assaulted. He sent me flowers with a note asking me out to a fancy event shortly after our class together ended. 

I was all messed up and I knew I couldn't date, even though I seemed fine to everyone. I gathered my courage to call him and say thank you, but no thank you, and it went to voicemail and I hung up because I hadn't figured out how to handle it that way.  I fell apart, because just realizing I was still so affected knocked the wind out of me. He called me back twice in a row and I never answered and never spoke to him again.

Until years later, after starting to acknowledge my issues, I dug up his phone number and called him after a glass of wine or two, and said ""Hey, this is ToughKitten. You sent me flowers and asked me out back in school. I liked you, but had been raped that semester and I wasn't emotionally ready to date anyone, and was too chickenshit to give you a proper answer."" I told him it always bothered me and I was sorry. He was wonderful about it, and that was the end of that."
"My first celebrity crush was Marilyn Manson when I was 12, so maybe not fitting in the norm?  

Also, a temper is totally attractive, which is so stupid.  Like, my brain is like ""seriously, why are you getting mad about that?"" but my body is like ""please touch me now""."
"""Boys can have boundaries too"" my son is 4, and he can recite our ""boundary talk"" back to me, but it seems most people only teach boundaries in relation to girls, I want him to know that his boundaries are just as important."
"because it's our fault if a man doesn't find us attractive. 

the movies tell us we need to be prettier/more popular to get the man, while the movies tell the guys that they just need an opportunity to prove how awesome they *always* were, and how foolish they and the dream girl were for ever thinking he needed to change. there was a ~hero inside all along.

so ''guess i'm not pretty enough...'' vs. ''i wasn't even given a CHANCE''"
"My brother while he was in for about 2 years. He was using me, but I love him.  The only time we ever really talk is when he's locked up. "
I got a DUI. It was my lowest point and made me reevaluate my life. Only my fiancé and family know. And my HR department. 
"I hate this shit.

My dad died last December. Yeah, it could be worse, but it's pretty fucking horrible right now. Now leave me alone to sob and get fat kthanks. "
That's the noise I make when I climax.
"Everything in my opinion. I do not want anyone to slap me, choke me, pull my hair, or jizz on my face. I find a lot of the mainstream porn very degrading."
That one day I'll be plucking that random chin hair that appears and it'll be super long and I'll keep pulling and pulling with the tweezers and pull all the hair off my head out that tiny hair follicle.
... please tell me soy sauce on chicken caccitore is a crazy example you made up to prove a point and not something he actually does.
"I have a few and these are from various relationships:

-Dave &amp; Busters + rush tickets for a Broadway show

-Paint Nite

-Picnicking on the beach at sunset

-Swing dance lessons

-Geocaching

-Drunk Shakespeare (this thing in NYC where the very talented cast members get drunk and perform Macbeth. It's amazing)

-Coney Island boardwalk "
"We were close friends and roommates at one point. The transition was increased flirting followed by a few long discussions about how we felt, what we were hoping for in a relationship, and weighing the risks vs benefits of dating. "
"It's not a top priority and I'm not willing to lower my personal standards just to find a SO. I am still active in online dating sites and try to be social. I'm very open for developing a relationship, but I'm not waiting around for one either. "
"I've had people super skeptical over totally unimpressive claims before.

""I doubt you ever actually worked in a hospital as security.""

""You probably didn't even minor in history.""

Who would lie about these things?"
"Anything related to networking for jobs.  I'm very introverted, I don't know a ton of people in the industries I'm interested in, I don't use social media, and it just feels disgusting to give a ""30 second commercial"" about myself.  And most of the networking advice I get seems geared towards people in the business/finance/sales/marketing sector, which is totally unrelated to my field."
"Agreed. How could this be anything but a joke? ""Space is gross"" is the funniest thing I've ever heard."
He got drunk and told me he liked me. It took me a while to decide that this was something that might work. I was terrified of losing a friend if it didn't. We are getting married in April. 
Tummy hair and treasure trails! Sooooo yummy.
"I went to a nearby gas station to purchase a bag of ice. When I requested it, the short, Indian counter worker told me, ""I can get you anything you want. You want star from sky?"" "

"""Please say short dudes, please say short dudes, please say short dudes..."""
"I know a girl who is Instagram and Facebook famous and is now working on even bigger opportunities in life because of it. Thing is, she's genuinely funny, makes me laugh my ass off, is gorgeous and very polite and respectful. 

Whenever I'm around her, I'm sorta blown away that a person like herself even exists. "
"I adore Civilization.  History has always been a subject of interest to me, so I love being able to play out an alternate history of sorts. 

I enjoy how it has many complex mechanics to keep track of, but gives you time to really think about each decision since it's turn based.  

Also, since you can get a new, randomly generated map each campaign, the game provides an endless supply of replay value: each map is a new puzzle to solve.  "
"Lol he should try walking in them, seeing as he's unused to it! "
