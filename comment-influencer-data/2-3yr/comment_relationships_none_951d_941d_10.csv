You sound exactly like every other cheater on the sub who Iâ€™ve ever heard defend him or herself. That right there should be enough for you. You sound *exactly* like them. 
"I'm sorry OP but it honestly seems like he isn't interested in you two being anything more than just a hookup/booty call. Five months is a long time to just be seeing someone without any labels, I would suggest you move on and find a guy that would love to spend a day watching the super bowl with you and hang out. "
"If you raised her right, the fact that he has smoked won't make her smoke it. I dated plenty of people that enjoyed recreational substances, but their hobbies never became my hobbies. It's a valentine date, not a long term commitment. Let her go out and have fun."
"Leashes are for dogs, not people."
"Eh if he left it in the fridge, I could see that. But the garbage... I think he's just selfish "
"No legitimate reason not to take her back? Hmm if my husband left me to go fuck around, found out he really ""loved me"" then tried to get back together, he'd regret ever treating me like trash.

No person who has self respect would be okay with being pushed aside so that their partner can go have sex with whomever. The trust issues and resent that would happen if they got back together would be astounding."
"Fortunately in my case I've realized this and gone pretty low contact with my mom and sister. Or maybe it's unfortunate that I can't have them in my life because they both have emotionally abusive tendencies. Oh well, family to me is the people you choose to surround yourself with. And I don't need people who think I owe them favors, money, or attention whenever it's convenient for them but who do nothing for me."
"The first time I met my SIL she had a shaved head and was wearing glasses with no lenses.  She was in some kind of ""buck the trends"" phase.  I didn't have a great first impression of her, which I am ashamed to admit.  She looked intimidating and like a try-hard.  Now, 12 years later, I know she's a giant softie with a heart of gold and I feel so bad for judging her.  Even if people do think you look like a lesbian, that could be making them nervous too.  Not everyone (again, often demographic specific) is comfortable with that.

It's great you are willing to be adaptable.  It's awesome to be all ""this is who I am so fuck you all"", but sometimes that gets in the way of life and careers, and if it's exposing your daughter to security outside the door, etc. sometimes we have to adjust our priorities.  You'll still have the tattoos (which sound amazing, I love nature tattoos), and you can always shave your head again when people know you better."
"He doesn't manage his money because he doesn't have to. 

*But what's the alternative? We get evicted?*

You always bail him out, in one manner or another. He just lets the pressure build until you give in.

You say you don't want to break up over money but in this case, money is just the beginning. He's going to expect you to manage most, if not all, aspects of your lives together. Is this what you want to sign up for forever?"
"Think of a word that makes her laugh or an inside joke between you two, then say it whenever someone else at the table says something about her appearance.

It'll cheer her up and make everyone else look stupid."
Yea I think point blank cutting across there trash talk is a good way to go if girlfriend will agree. However if she won't OP you can tell her you don't want to be a part of her family dinners. Tell her that your more than happy to go for coffee with her and her dad or go out for dinner with just him or what ever but you won't willingly put yourself through listening to them abuse the woman you love and nod and smile as though it's all fine. It's not fine she's doing what most abuse victims do. She is normalising the abuse. It's not normal you don't need to play along and pretend it is
"make sure you contact the caterer and other suppliers, in writing, telling them that only you or your husband can make changes to the arrangements

as for mom, if you don't stand up to her now it will only get worse in the future (imagine her interfering in child raising), so i would keep it simple and tell her she is welcome to come, but if she cannot then that is unfortunate and she will be missed

i'm not a vegan, and personally would prefer a thick slab of medium rare prime rib at a wedding dinner, but is it really the greatest catastrophe in human history if people instead get a nice salad? can they not give their arteries a rest for one night?"
"So you were 13 and he was 21 when you got together????

Fuck, OP, that's just disgusting.  YEs, he's abusive.  Yes, he is a terrible person and you need to leave.  "
"Have you explored *why* he feels that way, or what he's talking to get out of it? If he's disgusted with it, that might be hard to work around, but sometimes taking about the why leads to much easier compromises for both people. "
You're a grown up now. This scares him because your bullshitometer is becoming well developed. Time for him to start keeping you in line.
"&gt; I also understand that it puts him in an awkward position to always have to make these requests for her

No. no no no. 

There is no ""awkward position"". 
 
Sister makes a request. She begs, she pleads. She cries. She calls Mom and Dad, and they call boyfriend and say ""OH, just let her go. IT's family. She's your sister, can't you let her go just this once?"" &lt;---(HA! You mean just these 104 times????)

At ANY step here, boyfriend can say NO. Clearly. ""Nope. Not up for discussion. The answer is no. Still no. This is not open to you. The answer is no. No. You are not going."" 

It's only awkward because he is allowing the guilt trip. ""Oh, if I say no, she'll be so upset, what kind of horrible monster am I if I don't let my poor, lonely sister come along?"" 

I used to be like your brother and I needed to grow a spine and start saying NO. Yes, it was hard. You know what's harder? Losing out on people and things I love because I was too afraid to put my foot down to manipulators like his sister. 

You realize that if you get married and go on a honeymoon, no matter where it is, it will be a place that sister ALWAYS wanted to go, can't she just come along? "
"you need to leave this guy, he is gaslighting you, and he doesn't respect you."
"My mom has made worrrrlds of progress and I still dread the day I become a parent, or more importantly, the day she becomes a grandparent. She can do everything in her power to prevent the episodes, but they can still happen at any time and I wouldn't want my child around her when that happens."
"Even if you love someone, they are not perfect. I was about your age when I realized my parents were not perfect, in fact they had giant faults."
"My boyfriend has made a very similar post about me on here (right down to the toilet flushing :( )

This 110% sounds like ADHD."
"I mean, let's be honest, there's two equal parts to the ""Oh god, that's a sex video of my boyfriend"" shit sandwich:

1) I don't like seeing or imagining him with an ex.  Of any gender.  Comparisons ain't fun.

2) Oh shit.  If we ever break up is he going to just keep porn of ME on his hard drive FOREVER?!? 

Your problem is going to be that disclosure that such a thing exists at all could very well be an automatic dealbreaker no matter how carefully the entire reddit hivemind helps you craft your revelation.

Personally, as much as I miss them, I purge everything of this nature following a breakup and when I find someone new.  Too much risk.  Nothing stays hidden forever.  "
"&gt; He's doing you a favor in the end, because you're not wasting your time on a girl who doesn't value you the same way that you value her

Came here to post exactly this
"
What?!? Two years is not a long time. Especially considering they've probably got 60+ more. Not being ready now does not at all equate to waiting for someone better. Not everyone moves at the same speed. 
"For starters don't watch porn at work especially on company computers.  Most if not all businesses that have some degree of security involved monitor what happens on their computers.  

Best thing you can do is apologize and assure them it won't happen again.  Plan for the worse just incase this doesn't work.
 "
"Hitting on = chasing after
Hitting that = fucking "
"Ugh, that was all my ex ever bought me and I hated both of them but smiled to save his manipulative behavior about literally everything. He still didn't believe me, so eventually I gave up and told him I hated it. My current SO got me a nice 20 dollar galaxy bracelet and it was so beautiful, and so thoughtful (I literally founded the astronomy club at my hs with my ex and he couldn't figure that out). No heart shapes unless asked for, we know you just went to JCpennny and picked up the first thing you saw"
[deleted]
"I think she is being selfish here. 

Like the other poster said, split bills and costs in proportion to income. Don't let her take advantage of you."
How do you know he wasn't drunk? He smelt like alcohol... And you admit he was an alcoholic. Just because he was a functioning alcoholic doesn't make it safe for him to be around kids. 
"""and a home 110k over her budget.""

Well if she blows through the whole wad, I'm just going to hope this is in a low property-tax state. Just b/c she paid in full, there are still taxes and upkeep that go well beyond the initial ownership. 

I think the thing that needs to be done is make a list, i.e. of things of that nature so she understands the long-term costs of items (likewise with the car, i.e. any issues with a 60k car are much more expensive than the average car). Get her to understand yea she bought such stuff, but money needs to be saved for ""long-term"" items. 

Plus ask her directly about stuff like how much money she has aside for the kid to go to college. Make her aware of all these things."
"You tell it savage, but you make perfect sense. If what you're saying is true then I'm at least pretty relieved that I've cut the drama off at the knees every time it's come my way, even if I didn't know I was. I'm probably better equipped to ride out the next few weeks than I've been giving myself credit for.  You and /u/dildotantrum are right, it really does feel like I'm doing battle with a walking MRA playbook. Can't believe some people think that works, it's so cringeworthy to be anywhere near."
I'm thinking you might need to talk to someone more about your husband than your body. he is the problem.
"It doesn't sound like that to me at all. It sounds like she just wants something personal, and to be able to celebrate the marriage with the people who are closest to her. Her boyfriend initially showed interest, but now he's set on marriage and won't even consider a wedding."
[removed]
Yep. If a guy believes his penis is that gross he's got no business asking anyone to suck it.
Why are you being so aggressive? OP obviously sees it's an issue. 
"I couldn't absorb much past the word ""coke or whiskey.""  You know this man is blaming you for his shortcomings. I don't think it's worth it. "
"He shouldn't be forced to leave the cafe, but if he is a teacher and the lies of the waitress can affect his reputation, maybe it's for the better if he stops going to the cafe till the situation is solved."
"You're confused. The argument here isn't that people are not allowed to feel uncomfortable. It's that she should have spoken to her manager about a workplace issue instead of spreading rumours that can negatively impact someone's career. It's incredibly immature and unprofessional.

Also, your last sentence is painfully irrelevant.

""We don't know if OP's dad is a serial killer.""

""We don't know if OP's dad is a sexual predator.""

""We don't know if OP's dad is a trained assassin sent to kill Katherine.""

Take your what-ifs elsewhere."
"&gt; Its just he is a shitty person, not to me, but to the rest of the world. I'm not sure why, or how, but he has this idea that he is above societies rules.

I had a boyfriend like this in high school. Not quite to the extent you're describing, but he was genuinely sweet to me, and an outright ass to most other people.

We parted ways when he went to college. Without me around to ""raise"" him (and even he verified that that's what I was doing--raising him, like a child), he flunked out of college and lost his way because he didn't want to learn the self-control to get him through. And I was tired of being his surrogate mother, being a year younger than him. He *and* his mom both asked me to guide him, but I said no. He knew how to be a good person. He knew what was expected of him, what was legal, what would get him through life, etc. He knew how to do it, and he knew he was capable of it. He just couldn't motivate himself to do it without someone dangling the proverbial carrot in front of him.

Or at least that's how he was seven years ago, the last time I talked to him. I hope he's grown up a bit. Actually, I hope he's alive at all. But I am not going to let myself get dragged into a mess again by contacting him.

You're right that it's your choice what you do, but he's not going to change as long as he doesn't want to, and you will bear consequences of that.

He has to want to change for himself, by himself. Anything less, including your love and approval, won't stick."
"Well it should be about money to some extent.  If you go you will be 100% dependent on her for everything.  So, if it all goes awry, then what?  You have no money, no job and no family near by.  And remember this, she isn't your top priority, you are.  She can be second but do not let someone pressure you to giving up your life for theirs, you will just go on to resent them."
"Sounds like bad news, but as a 51/M with a daughter (29) I wish I could say it'll be OK, but he's found a new freedom and unfortunately he'll have to make his own mistakes, or hopefully come to his senses. you can try speak to him, he probably respects your opinion more than you know (I do my daughter), otherwise there's not much else you can do, all the best my girl xxx."

Close the door on her. 
"You are hilarious. Please tell me this is a troll post, because I'd feel so sorry for your girlfriend otherwise. "
"Your parents are more concerned with the opinions homophobic worthless pieces of shit than with your perfectly valid feelings. Assuming you don't rely on your parents financially : make a fucking scene. Or stop talking to them, quietly. But don't be a doormat. 

What happens if you get into a long-term relationship, do you hide your SO forever ? Will you let your bf get trashed ? What happens if you get married, do you hide your marriage and wedding (if you're into the whole idea of marriage) ? Or will you simply roll over and never get into a serious relationship ?"
"It's been 3.5 months and you don't like her... you don't need advice, just confidence! It's okay to break up with someone, especially if you're not compatible."
"You didn't read the part where he ""winds him up""? 5 year olds think very differently than adults. He picked on the kid who was already upset. 

He's douchebag who deserves to be dumped."
"Couple of hours, train tickets are between Â£50-80. But don't wing it, these are things you need to know before you come here. Really really. You HAVE to have a better plan."
"My dad dated drastically you ger women than him while I grew up, and while he was an ok dad I don't think he made a very good partner to the women he was with. I certainly don't let my boyfriends talk to me the way he spoke to them, or treat me so dismissively. There's hope yet, assuming this kid has other healthy role models. "
"""Call him out"" sounds kind of aggressive, what you do is you say ""Hey, I noticed you were playing video games but you said you had to study?  If you don't want to hang out with me at a given time, I'd prefer you just tell me that you'd prefer to spend time alone.""

Everyone needs time alone, it's not a big deal.  Just work on giving him the space to be able to tell you that."
"No matter how obvious it seems to you, your brother's girlfriend is not going to leave the relationship until SHE is ready. I personally haven't been in an abusive relationship but I've witnessed it first hand through a close friend. No matter how much logic, reasoning or pleading you do, she won't leave until she reaches her own breaking point. And if that happens, it'll be like a glorious light bulb on moment. The clouds will lift, she see she deserves so much better and she'll go for it. 

As for you, if you aren't close enough to her to stick this out, or even if now just negatively effecting your mental health,  you need to cut yourself off from the situation. Just tell her ""Look, I truly care about you but I can't do this anymore. I can't sit here and listen to all the terrible things he puts you through and not have a mental break. You deserve more. Here's some services that can hopefully help you and if you ever decide to break things off with him, I'll be right here for you. But as for right now, I have nothing left to give."""
"You should definitely talk to him and let you know how you feel. This is never a good thing, and it doesn't often end well (for you in this kind of scenario). Unfortunately, I'm not sure this relationship will work out, it definitely won't if his heart is on her and not you. It might be time to move on, something like this cannot be overlooked.

I am sorry this is happening. That really sucks. But things will get better in time, and you will find a man who truly loves *you* and no other woman.

Edited for spelling."
"So, not to alarm you, but some of those symptoms sound similar to leukemia. But if you've been tested through the roof, I don't really know what it could be. Possibly some sort of autoimmune disease? The good news is you're getting thoroughly tested. Stay positive and hopefully they find out what's wrong."
"I have the same personality type as you. I try extra hard to please and fit in, then get wiped out after a while and don't want to talk to anyone. I look back and cringe when I think of all the various social circles that rejected me or, even worse, the ones who I thought were nice people but they actually mocked me behind my back. I'm the same age as you as well. 

The trick I've learnt is to stay quiet then laugh expressively when someone jokes. I make the odd comment every now and then. I've been in my current workplace for eight years and feel comfortable and well liked by everyone but it took me a few years to get slowly to that point. "
[deleted]
I have an okay job but it's nothing spectacular. I don't know if they are successful now but we were always well off when I was growing up.
Do nothing unless she breaks up with her boyfriend. 
"I really don't feel like Lucy is doing anything here. OP says it's effecting her friendship with Lucy, but it sounds more like it's these ""guy friends"" that are the relationships she should really be evaluating. 

OP says nothing about Lucy intentionally stealing her thunder or trying to make OP feel like she's 2nd best. I've had a Lucy like that in my life and it's pretty obvious when they think they're better than you. 

I would say, really just stop it when it starts. If a guy starts asking you about her, be super aggressive up front and say, ""Listen, I'm not Lucy's gatekeeper and don't even start to think you can get to her through me. You're not the first to try and you sure as hell won't be the last.""

If OP wants a vetting process of decent dudes, I think Lucy is a pretty good way to find out which ones are total duds. "
"No offense, but you're still not there yet. Dating at 19 is totally different than dating at 25 which is totally different than dating at 30+. "
"Stop arguing with her. Start practicing saying ""if this arrangement doesn't work for you please feel free to find somewhere else that can accomodate your needs."" Cause you could find literally anyone else who will rent those rooms from you and actually pay you what it's worth. Is this girl a celebrity or something? I have no idea why she is so entitled and think it's a favor to let people hang out with her and her children. "
"Yeah, a lot of these people seem to be think you're ""too good"" for this neighborhood because it's in a poor area. The problem is that it is objectively crime-ridden, and if you're unfamiliar with big cities to begin with and your boyfriend has been regaling you with tales of hideous crimes, you're not going to feel comfortable. "
"If I were her and I was getting to live somewhere for free, I would get a sound machine if I could hear it. That's very kind of you to worry, but really she should be grateful that you are letting her stay with you for free. "
"Her WORDS tell you *what you want to hear;* her ACTIONS tell you *what you need to know.*

You need to dial back this friendship, if not simply go NC until you are over her."
"That was my first question too. If she knew he was in a long relationship and told him that anyway he should immediately start avoiding her. I can't think of any reason someone would say that to someone in a relationship without an agenda on it.

"
"I'm sure OP would have loved to go on a trip and have ""fun"" but they have NEWBORN BABIES."
"Definitely not your business, stay out of the parenting decisions.  Have a chat about it with your aunt if you must, but if you're critical of how she handles this, I wouldn't be surprised if it drives a wedge between you.  Probably a better angle would be to question if she's worried at all about the kids' behavior.

What happens when the kids fuck up in front of dad?"
"Start standing up for yourself, call her out on her lies and bullshit. She sees you as a doormat, you wipe your dirt on a mat, the mat doesn't wipe dirt on you. I would advise walking away from this girl. Might not be easy, but you don't need that kind of pressure, not when you've got your exams. It's a toxic relationship and while it might be upsetting and hard it will feel better in the long run. Also you should not feel bad about telling your friend about your problems and making her feel 'depressed' you're suppose to be able to tell them your problems, that's bullshit and she should feel ashamed for making another human being feel like they're alone and an annoyance."
"If it was just 1 or 2, I could see where you are coming from.  This is all 5 of them.  

Like the old saying goes.... ""If 9 out of 10 people are assholes, and all your friends are cool... you're the asshole.""  

I would look at what behavior you have been exhibiting lately, or it could simply be that you are just an acquaintance and they had these plans in the work for a while."
So much wisdom in this comment. And not just about sexuality but relationships in general.
"The more that you learn about this jackwagon, the worse he gets. :( "
It is worth talking with them - if this is a safety concern act with urgency and do the right things.  
"This isn't a great plan and is actually illegal in 11 states. 

As detestable as racists are, I don't think OP should do anything that would actually get her or her roommates either a.) in trouble with the law (low chance, but still a chance) or b.) in hot water with the racist neighbors, were they to find out. Better to try to ignore each other permanently than become the target of their ire, and if they *do* say or plan something, OP can go to the police and the FBI."
"thats a bit unfair, just because you like something it doesn't make her lucky. she said she doesn't like it, and has no sensation from it. dont trivialise how people feel just because that is something you would want"
"Or, if she thinks she might be into free use, she really **could** just go do whatever she wanted (i.e. browse reddit) while he goes at it. He's got a good thing going, but if it's not hurting her or him and he digs it why not just compromise to do what she wants while he does it?"
"&gt; Then be fair about it. Be willing to accept that he doesn't do it to be abusive or hurtful,

But....repeatedly violating boundaries is pretty much textbook ""gearing up to get real abusive"" shit. Tickling is one of them. When abusive men were asked about how they kept their partners, it was agreed that one had to wait a year (maybe two?) before violently hitting them. This kind of behavior is just a lead-up. So maybe he stops immediately and it's all great; the fact remains that this kind of physical violation should always be a red flag for future abuse.

"
"I think the problem here is that this situation is just fucked up enough that anyone going through it or trying to conceptualise going through it is going to be mentally uncomfortable enough that somewhere deep down they need to convince themselves this is something you can just softly get over without real confrontation when the reality of the situation is it's intensely fucked because yes, his wife cheated on him with his 19 year old brother and that's not something you just hug out and move on from."
"1.) You gave him the impression you were ending it. You implied you both liked eachother, so he obviously wanted things to continue between you. It sounds like he felt pressured into agreeing. If I said to you ""I always end things after 4 dates, I like it casual. By the way, we're on date four. What would you think about taking it easy for a while?"" Does that seem like I'm giving you a whole lot of choice in the matter? His options were agree with you or lose you.

2.) So you want to start off your relationship with a guy who is a ""keeper"" by keeping a secret from him. I'm starting to gather why you might struggle in relationships. You weren't exclusive by your choosing, and you have absolutely nothing to suggest he was sleeping with other people. He agreed to cut sex between you two, likely giving you space and respect. You're the one who jumped at the chance to sleep with someone.

3.) This is like shooting yourself in the fucking foot and complaining you can't walk. He was fine with you two. By your own admission, you claim it's you with the commitment issues, not him. This is the same logic that people use when they cheat on someone and claim that they did it because they were worried their partner was going to cheat. You were ready to leave him because you were getting cold feet, you scared the shit out of the guy by making him think you were about to walk, then you proposed a one-sided agreement that was entirely your idea, yet you're claiming it's you who wants to be sure? You two would likely be completely official by now if you didn't cut things off between you two for now. This is all on you, your choice.

4.) You don't know who he is sleeping with, and neither do your friends. You made the assumption that he was to justify your own decision to fuck your friend. After 5 weeks, it's entirely reasonable to assume he was being loyal to you. You're sitting there doing xyz and making the claim you did it all because you were concerned about his thoughts and behaviour. The mental gymnastics are hilarious.

Look, just be straight up with this guy that you aren't ready for a relationship because you obviously aren't. You sabotaged yourself for no reason, you made the choice to put a halt to what you admit was a wonderful connection between you two, you proposed an entirely one-sided agreement without clarifying anything to this guy, and rather than ask him questions about his feelings, you made the choice for both of you then asked a completely rhetorical question so you could claim it was a mutual decision. Your commitment issues are your own, but you sound like you have way too much baggage to make this work right now. I would be out of there so fast your head would spin, and in all honesty if you don't tell this guy what's going on you don't deserve him."
"&gt;33yo guy is dating a 21yo girl 

Swear to God, if you read this sub too much, it starts feeling like women don't date any men at least 10 years older than them.

So weird."
"I'll be honest and say as a man, I would be a little wierded out by what you want. Not ring wise, ring wise is absolutely fine. But the dress thing sort of makes a woman on a wedding day to me. Its a big special day and I can only assume he has spent his life envisioning his wife to be in a dress, now you've turned that into something completely different and it makes him uncomfortable, as its not ""the norm"".  
  
Honestly I dont know how you go about fixing it because you probably both wont want to budge. Maybe he thought the wedding you'd wear a dress because thats what girls do and didnt think much of your daily outfits affecting the wedding.  
  
Going to be a tough one to sort out but definitely go for what you feel comfortable in, but I can understand why he might feel uncomfortable."

"Interesting that similar stories - with similar questions - seem to be posted somewhat frequently as of late. 

OK. So you have made yourself more attractive to the opposite sex. It's one of the obvious benefits of success, and that's awesome. Congrats!

Enjoy yourself and the life you've built, man. Keep the momentum up! Don't drive yourself crazy worrying about who's out to take advantage of you as it's no way to live. Try not to overthink it all. If you like a girl that likes you, date her. If she has larceny in her heart, move on. 

Only you will be able to derive a woman's true intentions through honest interaction and you shouldn't ignore potentially good/fun matches just because they did not choose an earlier, unrealized version of who you are now. 

After all, weren't they different people then as well?

Just go have fun. Well - Smart fun. But you don't need me to tell you that.
"
"I think it's telling that she doubled down. The initial set-up could be forgiven due to naivete, although it's still a pretty massive betrayal, and shows she doesn't really empathize with others well. However, the fact that she screamed at you about how you ruined the moment she set up is telling. She wanted to be the puppetmaster for this wonderful, heartwarming scene. I think her reaction was actually about her plan blowing up and feeling embarrassed that she misjudged your reaction."
"She is abusive. When he left the dinner she stood in front of his car to control him and impede him trying to leave, and then she verbally abused him and escalated it until everyone came outside to see. Even if you don't think using the dinner to try to pressure him into enduring this is particularly abusive, you can't deny that she is."
"Your bf betrayal was as bad, if not worse, than Karen's.  He was probably telling her how he cared for her and all that non-sense prior to your breaking up, which is why Karen couldn't promise to steer clear of him.  If you can't forgive her I find it unlikely you'll be able to get over his betrayal either.  Ditch him and find someone who can maintain appropriate boundaries with friends of the opposite sex."
"Meh, I used to be that way but it ultimately didn't help me as much as it hurt me. People communicate in all sorts of ways, and (in my experience) if you go into every friendship or relationship with this ""no nonsense"" attitude towards direct communication, no one will tolerate your nonsense. And, since we're all people, we all have nonsense that others must tolerate. You'd just find yourself alone or surrounded by jerks (like I did).

We all have hangups that others must work around and in turn, we must decide something is a molehill or a hill to die on. It would be much worse if he just ignored it or pretended he was okay. He communicated his thoughts, and I think it was a good balance between being an ass versus being a doormat. Sometimes it's better to leave people guessing your *exact* thoughts or the degree to which you subscribe to a certain shade of grey; they can work through certain issues better that way. Not as direct but sometimes, it's more beneficial.

But that's just my opinion and my culture talking, I suppose. "
"This may not be all a money thing, but partly a character and attractiveness judgement.

Look, you're absolutely right, but you already know that. A purchase like this--one that you don't have to seek agreement on or are accountable for--is the *entire point* of having your own allowance cut out of the shared budget. She has no ""right"" to review this expenditure.

But here's another way of looking at it. I'm not validating her point, just offering you an alternative perspective that might help you ""navigate,"" as you say.

Imagine rewinding things to where you were dating and your finances were not commingled (this is relevant because I think in a healthy relationship you should continue dating each other to some extent). You were each single and you *definitely* didn't owe each other any explanation for where you spent your money. Now imagine you observed her spending thousands a year on what you consider pointless frippery, like makeup . You might say to yourself, ""Ugh, what vanity. To spend so much on something so pointless. Can't she think to do something constructive with that money?"" It might make her less attractive to you. (A side note: I'm not dissing people who spend a lot of money on makeup. Some potential partners would be attracted to it, and some wouldn't, is the only point). What you spend money on says something about who you are. Depending on the beholder, it could be a good thing: ""Wow, dude, awesome car! Let's ride!""; or a bad thing, ""Jesus, who would spend so much on just a *car*, no matter how many fins, stripes, or turbochargers."" The fact that your highest dream since you were a kid is an expensive computer to play video games on might be a triggering an ""ew"" reaction.

That might be something to keep in mind.

Secondly, an equal allowance might not actually be fair. It's more complicated than that, especially if you're conflating ""personal expenses"" with ""fun expenses""--you're mixing together that which is ""discretionary"" with that which is ""frivolous"". You're different people and have both different expenses and a different idea of what is necessary and what is fun. She may, in fact, think that the fact that you have an ""extra"" $5,000 and she doesn't indicates that you were getting too much money all along, as in ""the amount we chose was supposed to be so we didn't have to clear every $5 coffee or book with each other before buying it, it wasn't supposed to cover getting a car (or a computer that costs as much as one).""

Here's one concrete example, and though it might not apply to you specifically, it is very common. Women's ""personal expenses"" are usually much higher. Unless you're going to consistently go for the ""I am making a countercultural statement"" look, then almost everything for women is more expensive than for men, sometimes hugely so. If you're covering clothing, personal care, shoes and the like, the fact is that all her stuff is going to be more expensive, flimsier and less versatile. If she needs to buy a second or third purse out of her allowance, it may seem unfair that you can ""save"" that money on something completely frivolous (and not just ""discretionary"").

I'm putting these points forth in an effort to help you understand what she might be thinking and feeling. I'm *not* saying she's correct. The terms under which you saved your allowance were clear, and going back on it now would be tremendously unfair to you. But allocating money is important, and you may need to reconsider it.

Perhaps you can propose something like ""since these were our terms under which I saved this money, I'm going to go ahead and bought what I saved for. I do respect your feelings and your stake in how we allocate money, so I'm open to discussing how we can modify our budgeting to address what you think might be more fair, and so we create a situation where neither of us ever has to feel bad about spending 'frivolous' money on something earmarked for it. But that's still for the future--retracting our 'deal' on me now would be treating me unfairly."""
"Honestly? I think it would probably be for the best if both you and your boyfriend cut all contact with her. Ask your friends and family not to give you updates on what she's doing - it hurts your BF. 

I mean... why do you know the wedding date?"
"Does that have any bearing whatsoever on this issue? No, no it doesn't. "
"Oh please. Even teenagers can take responsibility for their actions. Many of them don't like it, but they can. "
Anyone who uses numbers to rate a person unironically is gross.
"OP wasn't called a loser or a sinner. He's definitely trying to downplay some serious problems in the post. Doing a pretty good job of making cocaine use and ""almost dying of alcohol poisoning"" seem like everyday life. 

Kicking him out was some shitty parenting, but it doesn't seem like OP has quite enough distance or maturity to reconnect successfully."
"If it had just been about the ER visit for a minor cut, I could see why she felt like you were handling it.  There doesn't need to be a crowd of people at the ER for no reason.

But it seems pretty weird that she wasn't willing to drop off supplies for her daughter, especially the car seat.  That's something parents always have to be prepared to do."
You don't have to stay glued to your husband's side everywhere you guys go. Especially if this is your favorite band? He does this to you all the time. He needs to stop being so controlling.
"As a mom, this got to me:

&gt; Her Facebook page was filled with pictures of her new family and I saw how happy she was. There were pictures of them traveling, having picnics, simple stuff like that and I have decided I won't ruin that for her. She has found happiness and I realized I missed my chance of having that. I let it go.

Given OPs circumstances, I would say there is no way he has missed this chance. There is no way she would be less hapoy if he came back into her life. I hope he reaches out to her. "
This is true.
"Sounds like their communication sucks in general. She came for a suprise visit, but in her defense he never told her he had a trip planned. Call me crazy but vacations and travel plans are something people usually share with their SO's...."
"Dude, just let her go.  You're in a no win situation.  Just let her go and move on."
"I personally do not support the defense of 'don't you trust me,' particularly regarding situations that a partner is uncomfortable with. 

I am not advocating controlling behavior. What I am saying is, if a partner voices concern about a situation, there should be a sincere discussion regarding boundaries and feelings. Seriously--if my boyfriend said he felt uncomfortable with me being alone with a friend, no matter the reason, I would prioritize listening to and understanding his feelings. If I feel like this fears are unwarranted, I would still come home to discuss them and figure out why he has them. If I disagreed with him, I would still try to find a reasonable compromise for the situation. If I respect his fears, I am going to work with him on how to compromise so that both our needs are met. My boyfriend has never tried to keep me from my friends, nor would he, and there are still certain situations I would *not* engage in.

If your partner is upset or frightened over something, that should matter to you. Even if you ultimately both decide that the fears were unwarranted, it's not cool to dismiss them out of hand. Trust is something you earn, it's not something a partner just owes to you. If they ask you for reassurance on that trust, it's part of a relationship to determine what that entails. And then, if you feel like it's unreasonable, there is an incompatibility that needs to be addressed. 

A relationship can't survive if concerns are dismissed as 'overreacting' or 'controlling'--they are either real, and deserve consideration, or *are* controlling, which is a serious issue on its own.

"I have to say, I *kind-of* understand where you are coming from, but I think this is one of those light grey areas.  If you get on someone's computer uninvited and start looking through their shit, that's an invasion of privacy.  But if someone knowingly lets you use their computer and you stumble across something. . .  Let me analogize.

You go to someone's home, they invite you in and say ""make yourself at home, I'm going to go get changed"".  Then, while you are waiting you go looking for the bathroom and while opening doors you find the closet where the riding crop, bridle and rubber suit are kept.  You of course immediately close the door, but then think again and open it back up because you are curious if they buy from the same supplier as you.  Is it a violation?  Well, yeah, a little.  But if you keep your shit in the hallway closet next to the bathroom, you kind of invited it.

Contrast that to being invited in and being told ""please have a seat, I'll be right back"".  Then you get up and start pulling all the DVD boxes off the rack to see which racy ones are hidden behind the front row and then opening the weird ones up to see which disks are actually in the boxes.

Personally, I think his biggest problem was one of etiquette.  If you accidentally stumble across something private that might be embarrassing to the other person, the proper response is to pretend you didn't and leave them their dignity.  In the case of a girl-friend, maybe you start hinting that you're really open minded and see if you can draw out a discussion."

"&gt; I have been in plenty of jobs where I wasn't given direct training.

Were any of these for IT positions?

&gt; Just because there wasn't a designated person telling him what to do, doesn't mean he couldn't learn the job. 

It doesn't mean they necessarily couldn't. However, *especially* if they're in a technical/industrial field (as OP explicitly stated her BF was), training is in fact completely essential. If it's an engineering/IT firm, for example, you don't just let the employees loose to figure out their job on their own unless you want the company to burn down.

Yes, it is theoretically possible that in a company unlike the one OP said her BF belonged to, BF could reasonably train himself. The technical field he's in, however, makes that highly unlikely to the point of basically being a fantasy.

&gt; if they have an entire staff of people who have somehow managed to figure out what to do without a designated person to train them

OP didn't state anything even close to that. You're making an unfounded assumption here."
"In tiny, short increments. If she was lucky. While she was physically recovering from birth and perhaps breastfeeding. Have you spent any time alone taking care of him?

"It is exactly that. Look I am a casual sex person, this is one of those things that wanting to wait is totally fine. The other person should be ok with that really. I will say there are not as many guys on online dating sites willing to take it slow, if I had to hazard a guess its probably around 1/3 of guys on there that would match up with your timeline, so your pool is smaller. Also this is going to sound super shallow, but is sadly true: you are going to get more leeway on this the hotter you are."
"But you are. You can feud with your stepmother all you want, but what you're doing with the wedding isn't punishing her. You're retaliating against your sister instead.

Well the first time you lost your fucking mind and you admit you grilled him a to about if he slept with her (which he didn't). Some people close up when they are verbally attacked over NOTHING.

"I wouldn't limit it to a man, not just as a ""never know who she'll be into someday"" thing, but also because this same thing applies to if girls bully her at school, etc. I've seen some *messed up* platonic female friendships in my day and your daughter should feel empowered to not put up with abuse from ANYONE. It also might help sort of open the conversation up so it isn't just ""this man you love is terrible"" and more ""these are how humans are supposed to treat each other and you should always stand up for yourself when you aren't being respected.""

ETA: You can also plant the seed that when someone acts out like this, they need help but that the person they are hurting can't be the one to help them. When a person leaves someone they care about who always-a-good-person-until-they-get-angry, it isn't that they're abandoning that person. It's because that person needs help in order to be safe to be around, and the person they're making unsafe can't help them, and never will be able to."

You didn't mention that she has tried to kick them out or given you an ultimatum.  Which says to me that she *is* okay with it, she's living up to the agreement you made.  You have to stop taking it personally that this situation creates a lot of stress and problems for her."
"Obviously from reading this, the issue isn't the fact you aren't as pretty. Clearly, from the consensus of people you know and the fact that generally people know their level of attractiveness there's no contest. I'm sure you're prettier. Overall, this doesn't really matter anyway- the relationship matters and he clearly finds you attractive. The fact that your boyfriend said it to your face though is the issue because 1. he actually compared you two on looks which is weird IMO and 2. didn't filter it to your face which any idiot knows is going to hurt someone they love.

Don't get insecure about your looks. Get insecure you may not have the best partner for you because he's immature."

You're not even trying to get her fired, only to end her harassment - why on earth would you feel responsible if that's how the boss chooses to handle it?  For that matter, for how she deliberately treats you, why do you care if she feels insulted by anything you say?  She has been told to knock it off, she is non-compliant, and even the co-workers have had enough of her.

It seems as if your boyfriend is not quite ready to fully commit to your relationship. Your reaction might have been off, but this should have made him reflect on his behavior since you clearly don't feel secure. To me it seems like you should sit down and have a talk, if he still fails to empathize or understand your point of view, I would start considering if you want the same thing from the relationship, because to me it seems like he is not ready to commit.

"The first incident is a red herring- you can't get mad at someone for being asleep. But the second incident is worrisome- you called SIX TIMES in half an hour and he actively ignored it because he was in the car with a friend- a friend who apparently is comfortable enough with checking the phone in the car that *he* responded to your messages? I think any reasonable person would assume someone calling six times in a row had a serious/emergency issue to discuss. The fact that he didn't care to answer- and that he didn't apologize or understand why you were upset- is a pretty grim sign for the state of your relationship.

If this is an accurate interpretation of events, if he actively ignored six calls in a row (rather than not having his phone out and ringer on so that he didn't hear it) and then was a jerk about it, I would say it's safe to assume that this relationship is not long for this world."

"On my campus they were eventually all kicked off because of behavior issues.  Major behavior issues (that they carry on off campus now).  Several girls died of exposure after getting drunk and falling asleep, naked, on the front lawn.  Beer cans *everywhere*, it was a serious trash issue that none of them would clean up, one house had all of the sisters registered as sex offenders after they decided to go streaking through a group of freshman.  Except they weren't freshmen, they were a group of students there for a music concert, they were middle school and high school students.  My University kicked all of the Greek chapters off campus after drunken shenanigans on both sides became too much and they refused to clean up their acts.

That's the image a lot of Greek chapters paint, Animal House style, and that's why they have the reputation they do.

"Why does a grown man of 38 with a wife and 4 kids need to text his co-worker to ask how her day was? Could you not shift your focus and attention on them instead?

Choosing college over her high school relationship is the RIGHT decision, and one that if I were her friend I would have told her to do as well.

I know you said you want to marry her but in all honesty I think it's probably best for you two to end it now, as I don't think this relationship is cut out for the challenges of long distance because of college."

One angry letter from me to the school principal, and that crap never happened again; their solicitor wrote back to assure me that there were no restrictions on how the student talked about her parents.

Bottom line: if talking to the principal directly doesn't work, other people can be brought in to have that conversation."
Well that's just extra fucked up then. 
"&gt; but he works 10 hours a day 

That is a little much I guess, but not really out of the ordinary to be honest.


&gt; he's mindnumbingly bored

Then he needs a different job. I'm sorry, but if I had to constantly text my fiancee for the 10 hours I'm at work AND call her three times daily just to get through my job, I'd find a different job.



I've been in truly numbing employment positions before I landed my current job... and that need never crossed my mind. A few texts when bored? Sure. But he can't really be putting his all into his work if he's this communicative during the day. And if he *is* doing his job perfectly and has this much time, he needs a new job."
"To me, this is the bigger issue. If he just chose not to use condoms in the past, that's a personal thing, but he's outrightly trying to avoid OP's wishes."
"Doesn't instagram just automatically put stories at the top of your timeline? They're not all necessarily the people you follow, there are some ""similar accounts"" mixed in. Plus they autopay through the stories.

So I'm betting she was looking at a string of stories and yours came up. It's quite possible she didn't even seek you out."
"Christian? Because real Christians provide love and support, dont judge and dont kick their kid out because their lifestyle makes them look bad.


Keep reaching out to your sister in less obvious ways. She'll be an adult soon and you can mend bridges."
"&gt; She replied ""I meant to send you the link to that website because it had information about pregnancy tests but I accidentally sent the picture instead"".... I haven't questioned her any more since.

She's lying. That's so implausible it makes me laugh. She's not even a good liar. I am a woman and I don't normally leap to the ""evil woman tries to trap a man with a fake (or real) pregnancy"" conclusion, but it's such an obvious lie that it's laughable.

INSIST on going to a doctor's appointment with her. Tell her you will not speak to her or discuss anything further until after that happens. Don't have any other conversations with her. And for the love of god (and I'm sure you know better), do not hook up with her again. I knew a girl like this years ago and she went to great, alarming lengths to try to appear pregnant after a mutual coworker broke up with her. She was a pretty, seemingly normal girl but she went absolutely bananas. Ultimately, he forced her to let him go to the doctor with her and learned she'd never been pregnant. Even normal-seeming people (men AND women) can do crazy things, and if she'd lie to you about a picture, I wouldn't trust her.

On the off chance she ISN'T lying (which I sincerely doubt), well, ultimately, whether she has an abortion is up to her. Is that fair? I don't know, but it is her body that is carrying this (probably imaginary) child, so at the end of the day, it's her say. Don't be an asshole to her about it because you're both responsible and it's just as much your ""fault."" If she decides to have the baby, you'll be responsible for child support. You don't have to be in the kid's life (what kind of person that would make you would be up for debate), but you will be responsible for that. You don't have to have a relationship with this girl, you don't have to talk to her (outside of child support-related stuff), that's it. 
If she DOES opt for abortion, you should offer to pay for half the cost since you're both half responsible (if she refuses this arrangement, just pay for the whole thing -- it's not worth the fight and the risk that she could refuse the abortion if you don't). "
"The thing that gets me the most about this is that he called it weird first. If he thought it was such cool art, why not open with that??? Why get offended when you agreed that it's kinda weird?

She did!  She told him she liked him first.
"You might be right about trying too hard.  I definitely don't like to be the center of attention.  But by trying too hard I was the center of attention at times, which is not my natural environment.  So maybe people were reacting to me like you'd react if you saw a polar bear in the jungle.  You'd put your fork down and say...wtf."

I know this sub is pretty down on Valentine's Day, and I think it's fine for someone to not want to celebrate, but I also think that if your partner wants to do something that you don't super care about, it's still nice to do it just for them.  There are so many ways to compromise, like maybe OP would be happy with a nice dinner at home and a card instead of an expensive dinner out and a bunch of gifts.  If one person wants to do something and the other doesn't, I think meeting in the middle is good if at all possible - and even if you think Valentine's Day is stupid, is it really so bad to do a little something nice just so your SO will be happy?"
"I'm sure plenty of people will think you should litigate what your son did and it's true, whether 5 people or 25 people trashed your home is kind of irrelevant. However this post is about anger and self-control. 

The key question here is do you think you lost control? It sounds to me like you did but I wasn't there. If you did, is this the first time? If not, how often does it happen?

It sounds like your husband lost control too. When you're concerned about a family member's behavior but in control the tone is very different. How often has he spoken like this? 

Finally, it sounds like your son lost control. More understandable because of his age and the fact he'd been made homeless. What was your relationship with him like before this event? "

Opals are very delicate and get damaged extremely easily. They're prone to scratching and cracking. They're only a 5 on the Mohs Scale. I wouldn't get anything less than an eight for a ring that you'll be wearing almost daily for years.

"This happened to me with an ex. We were having some issues but i was absolutely in love and wanted so bad to make things right.

One day when i was coming home from an exam a man attacked me and hit me in the street and the police did nothing to help me. I was very shocked, because this is not very common in my country and the whole situation (common or not) was very upsetting. So i went home and fell myself asleep crying. 

When i woke my phone had blown up with texts from him demanding me why i wasn't replying and who i was with, etc. I immediately called him, explained the situation and the first thing he said was ""but what where you wearing?!"". He didn't even ask if i was OK. It was like a switch as you say. The moment jealousy went way too far. I broke up."

"It actually gets easier as you age. If you're young and pretty it's easy to wonder if you're just getting interest because of those factors. But at the end of the day, regardless of your age *or* looks, when you meet and start dating someone who's into you as a person you will know. Mostly because he will a) go out of his way to see you and spend time with you b) will be invested in long, interesting conversations about your interests and values c) will make you laugh so hard you will cry (and vice versa) d) will not be afraid to express how he feels about you, either through words or actions. 

I mean girl I'm 27 and not worried about getting older. You really are as old as you feel, you know? You can stay youthful without being young. You can be sweet and caring and have a good time and laugh until your sides hurt your entire life. 

If what you're going to miss is the flocking attention for your ego, then you can either get famous or get plastic surgery. "
"So your wife had an affair and it only ""ended"" once she was caught, and again she only ""asked for forgiveness"" after she was caught. She is willing to work on your marriage, but only because she got caught. 

So, instead of confiding in you she went out and had an affair, and now her dainty little world is falling down and people will know her to be a cheater, so now shes willing to work on things... because she got caught. 

""She couldn't help it"" what a fucking asshole. She couldn't keep from cheating on you and now she wants to work on things... fuck that noise. There are certain things a person has to do to get past an affair and she absolutely did every single thing wrong that makes it unable to work. Fuck her, and her two timing bullshit. 

It's better to be with a woman you can trust in a healthy relationship, then be hitched to some cheating sack of shit. Yeah, I said it, I meant it, I'm here to represent it. She is a cheating piece of shit, who is only concerned for her own needs. 

And this whole idea of forgiveness is a long as path with no guarantees, Hell, two faced asshole like her is probably still cheating or will evolve it to cover her tracks better. Cheaters, aren't worth your time, nor are they worth the novelty of knowing such losers exist.  "
"""My relationship with my best friend is being affected by her having a relationship and me not, I can't feel bad for her when she complains to me I really just feel annoyed by her more than anything.""


Yes, because judging by your post, you're an incredibly selfish individual."
"She likely has really good company on missing the rest of the game.  After that horrible ghost spuds mackensie commercial with the score 28-9, I'll bet quite a few people turned it off.  Maybe there is a support group."
"Yikes. Begin the process of protecting your information by turning on credit monitoring reporting, to begin with. You can also lock down your credit be enacting the use of a password for a credit score to be run, which will prevent someone from checking your credit in order to obtain a new credit card, a line of credit, etc. Close down credit cards to which she has access, and move funds from a bank account to another if she has access to anything like that. 

Consider this a big lesson learned and in the future, do not move so fast with someone. There is NO WAY you knew her well enough at 4 months after evidently a LDR to make this huge step not only of having her move in but giving her access to private, personal information. It is a huge red flag that she left presumably young children several hours away as well. Protect yourself and kick her out, then move on with your life and make better choices in the future. "
"Maybe try framing it as something you want for her. It sounds like you actually like her and care about her as a person other than this one issue. If she slowly starts making friends and having her own life now, then 5 months from now when you guys move, it won't be such a shock. She is going to need a new roommate so she should start reaching out and trying to find people now. I'm sure your brother wants to make sure she is staying with someone who is safe and isn't a completely random stranger. Honestly, if he allows her to move with you all to a new city and wants her to move in with you again, I'd leave him. Unless there is some kind of cultural issue where the family expects her to live with him until she gets married and saying no is a huge cultural and family taboo, living together again is totally unacceptable. "
She said they are non-traditional and they had already talked about marriage. It sounds like they had discussed it enough that she was sure he'd say yes.
"I love this advice, and second it. There was only about a year and a half of my life that I was alone. I moved to a new city far away from my friends and family, and was in a very dark place. I went to the shelter one day and found the saddest looking dog there, because she reminded me of myself. She's 14 years old now. I can't even believe it when I think of how much our lives have changed over the past decade. My husband loves her more than he loves most people. My stepson was terrified of dogs until he met her, and he refers to her as his dog sister. We even have two cats who adore her, but she unfortunately does not reciprocate their affection. I began my adult life with just me and her, and now we have a whole family. "
"Yeah, you're right - she should annul the marriage she has to the father of this child and never speak to him again, that'd be a much better outcome.

"Thank you for the response! I think that is exactly what I'll do--try these various approaches and see what works with him best and also ask for his feedback!

The bf and I have been really working on our communication, and its great someone noticed it here (although embedded in other issues), so thanks for that! I'm actually going to show him this post, so he can also get some feedback on what comfort he is actually seeking. 

^(P.S. It's really inspiring that someone is rooting for us, yay!)"
"They can just go back to being in-laws, lol"
That's a good way of putting it.  I'll be using that expression.
"Since she came from a controlling, abusive household, she's probably used to constant attention. Even though the attention she got was negative, it was still attention. Now that she's moved out, she's looking for that elsewhere and she's getting it from this guy. He's weird and people don't like him, but she's used to having SOME sort of focus on her so even if it's uncomfortable, she'll put up with it."
"A few ways that I was taught (and subsequently found to be successful) are the following principles: 
  
- Ask open ended questions (not yes/no questions) (e.g. ""How was your boss today?"" instead of ""was your boss better today?"")
  
- Use ""how"" or ""what"" instead of ""why"" as ""why"" makes people feel defensive (e.g. ""what about your day was terrible?"" instead of ""why was your day terrible?"")
  
- Repeat back their ideas/summarize their statements using different words (""I'm so tired because my boss kept making me redo the reports until I couldn't see straight."" ""Wow, that sounds completely exhausting."" instead of ""Wow, that sucks."")
  
- Don't suggest solutions, redirect to their ideas (""Ugh, what do you think I should do about my boss?"" ""It sounds like there's a lot going on there, what do you think would make you less stressed?"")
  
We tend to have an instinct to want to reassure or troubleshoot problems but most people have an idea of what to do in the situation and instead just want someone to let them talk about what's going on. So, let your boyfriend get what he's feeling off his chest. These tips will help you be a better listener in general and hopefully help both of you communicate better with each other."
"Good for you man, that's a super mature thing to do. We need more young guys like you and less like your friends. Keep being a stand-up guy, it'll get you far in life."

"Anger issues? Good, he can work on anger management or the underlying issues with his family that are fueling the fire. Alcohol and cocaine will also be impacting on his mood and anger outbursts. He won't be able to address his anger issues until he addresses his drug use. Does he consider himself with a drug problem? Does he want to moderate his use? This is step 1. If he doesn't think he has a problem then you've got a problem. 


Narcissism? What you are describing here is personality. Personality traits are very hard to change even when someone is motivated to change. If it is his personality then you're going to have to learn to live with that. 

What's more important for me is whether he's able to empathise with others. Can he step out of himself and put himself in someone's else shoes and then tell you what emotions they are likely to feel? Empathy is something you can work on and improve but once again, your bf needs to be onboard. Ask him to try to empathise with someone who he's intimidated or stolen from. 

TL;DR - you bf grew up in an alcoholic family which presumably involved verbal and physical violence. He toughened up to survive and now he's using that same 'mode' in life. He needs to realise that he's no longer a kid and the way he survived in the past will only bring grief in the future. You could try to help him understand this.. "

ugh.

"PLEASE tell your mom.  


This is waaay beyond what you and your sibs can do."
She's not interested in dating you nor does she feel the same way about you as you do her. 
"I can see why you are concerned.  You brought up your concerns and she passes them off.  She needs to understand how serious you are about her, and it.  If he paid, that is a definite red flag.  Voice your concerns that she may not see him ""that"" way, but you have suspicions that he sees her that way and that's why you aren't comfortable."
"Cool, so there is a huge difference between writing erotic fiction and posting it on line and violating a sexual boundary. 

The 'random guys to jack off to' thing is a red flag for me. That sounds possessive. 

You have your own agency. I don't think you're doing anything wrong, and I think he's going to far with what posting erotic stories means. "
"I think you're in the right to spend your own personal funds as you like. I think your wife is also right to view it as a major purchase nonetheless, and to be disappointed if you buy it.

I love computers, love gaming, and have built several PCs. $5000 is frankly pretty ridiculous and is well beyond the point of diminishing returns. Spend half, get 99% of the enjoyment, and a lot less grief from your wife. 

Make it clear going forward that if she wants to have a say in your personal spending (e.g., thinks it should be spent on a joint vacation), she needs to be ready to contribute equally to that from her own account BEFORE she starts complaining."
God forbid he think of the family that just lost a loved one. I wonder - does he think of their comfort?
"It might be worth it to get a pet - either now or when she passes - to help you feel less alone.  Make sure you get to know the animal at the shelter before adopting them, so that you don't find out too late that you have incompatible personalities.  

I agree with therapy if you can afford it.  You might also find a support group for family of people with terminal illnesses, where you may be able to find friendship or at least solidarity.  

Take good care of yourself, cherish your remaining time with your mother, and try to take advantage of the resources available to you.  I hope things get better for you."
"TBH, I think I sympathize with you moreso than your boyfriend in this scenario.  However, other people have done a good job of consoling you and explaining why you're in the right, so I just want to add one more thing that *could* be occurring from your boyfriend's point of view.

Some people are just really, really bad with funerals.  Even when they know the person, it can be hard for them to go.  My father is like this - he actually just had a close friend die, and I don't think he'll go to the funeral.  It's almost an anxiety thing for him - he's not good at expressing his emotions, and to be in a room with so many people expressing so many emotions is really hard for him.  There have been some funerals that my dad has attended, and others that he would be expected to attend but has missed for this reason.  While it's always been nice having him there for me, I empathize with him a lot and do not want to put him through that ordeal for me when I know that there are others there that I can also rely on.  I don't think my dad is a bad person at all for not always going to funerals, even if I'd prefer he did go.  Personally, I would go, but I understand why others may not want to go.

Your boyfriend does not seem to have expressed this - so I may just be totally reaching based on my experiences.  But if you do want to sit down and have a deeper conversation with him about why you need him there and why he doesn't want to be there, just keep this anecdote in mind as a possible response from him. "
"This should be upvoted more as OP hasn't given little to any info on the BF. Lots of assumptions being thrown around. However, if OP's BF can't conform to any of the very real exceptions above he should surely grow up and go. "
"You've arranged a 'dating' weekend, a romantic couples trip (sounds fab, by the way).  Why does your partner not want to be alone with you?  Why does he want his sister to come? Why does she want to come instead of either being/speaking to her boyfriend?

I completely understand your frustration and would have gone nuts by now.  Why is she even involving the parents?  That's so childish.

I'd take a big step back and look at the whole family dynamic here, something;s not right..."
There are several videos on youtube of fursuiters being kicked out of stores for this exact reason.
"I'd never say to do something illegal, so let me speak more broadly.

You're young, don't let a relationship bog you down and prevent you from experiencing and growing as a person. Now I'm not sure if he regularly uses threat of breaking up to keep you from doing things, and its up to you to decide if youd rather have that experience than be with him. I've never been a fan of dating people who went straight to breaking up to get their way tho."
"Oh Jesus you are in for a world of hurt 

You're basically saying you're not going to care for your child.  When exactly does your girlfriend get a break? She's going to be effectively working 24/7 whilst you do your 12 hours and then come home and kick back. 

I'm a nurse so I get how stressful working in the medical field can be but looking after a kid is a fucking nightmare and is why I'll never have kids. It's none stop.  

I suggest you make sure she knows exactly what you seem to be expecting of her, because your idea of her being primary caregiver is not the same as hers (and the rest of societies for that matter). From the sounds of things she's not just going to be primary caregiver she will be the only caregiver.

How have you been ripped off? You created this child so you help look after it. "
VERY exhausting indeed. The 6 month lease sounds like a good idea. I have brought it up to him over the past couple months that I'm thinking about getting my own place in Seattle. I don't think he takes me seriously.
I'd be interested in an update once you get this worked out.
"Ok I'm hoping this is all like a language barrier issue and that you're not as selfish as you're sounding.

One of the problems is you keep saying 'it will come naturally for me to want to spend time with my own child'

Er. Maybe?

A lot of dads, more than mothers, actually don't bond well with their child at first and DON'T naturally want to spend time with them. Also NO ONE naturally wants to spend time with a shitting/puking/screaming ball of sticky at 3am. If you're going to be relying on doing only what comes naturally in terms of what you want - you're going to be a shitty father and a shitty partner. Everyone would be. 

You're also sounding pretty inflexible which I think people are worrying about - yes you've agreed that your girlfriend will do all the chores and the majority of the child rearing - but you've already hit a roadblock that's almost crippled you in her being ill - there needs to be back-up plans if one of you can't fulfill their side of the 'agreement' (like if you became severely ill she couldn't remain a stay-at-home wife). No one, absolutely no one, really is prepared for having a baby and how it goes weird will be individual for everyone. You have to be prepared to be flexible. No matter how she gives birth she's likely going to be in pain for a while after - so she won't be able to do the chores. Equally if your baby gets a little ill, or is a little clingy, it's going to be impossible for her to keep the house up. At the moment it sounds like you're refusing to admit these possibilities and are just going 'WE AGREED AND SHE'S FINE'. Which is fine - just be aware that she's fine now because well... she's fine. She might become unfine, the baby might become unfine, and they'll need you to pick up the slack and be flexible with what you agreed. "
"His words were extremely objectifying. The person he was talking to seemed to want to shut down the conversation and he just continued because he thought his wife was sleeping and couldn't hear him. His wife. The person he should be talking to about sexual things he wants to try. The one person in the world who he really needs to talk to about that, not a guy friend and not about what he thinks he will be able to get away with. OP is his wife and she is a person, not a fleshlight or a sex robot. His words show a lack of respect that, to me, indicates he is not mature enough to be married. "
Agreed.  Please do not read my explanations as support for the behavior. OP should sit this one out.

Offer her friendship, and maybe she'll reach out to you, but it'll take time to ever (re)gain her trust. With some luck, her parents will eventually relent and let her maintain some contact with the outside world. Or she'll seek out an escape on her own.

Your wife works more than you, cooks for you every night, bought you a TV so you both could watch TV at the same time.

Which makes me think that your real problem is that she's making personal connections with people who aren't you.

I do worry about back child support. I have everything that I've given her documented (no cash) so at least there is a record of it. I'm not sure if that will matter though.

The problem is she is very unlikely to agree to terms. I anticipate the court battle to be as bad as possible once it starts (I'm talking false allegations of abuse, the whole 9 yards). She has said that she will never accept anything less than 100% custody and either has or fakes a panic attack anytime I try to talk to her about it. She is not a reasonable person. 

I've been waiting on court mainly because of my son's medical needs. I don't want to go into too many details on that but basically the intervention and therapy he gets during the first 2 years of his life are vital in terms of long-term outcomes. I worry that once I go to court my ex will become a crazy non-functional mess. Right now, while I'm playing by her rules, she's actually doing a great job with him. If I go to court now and it drags out for 6 months to a year and leads to my ex being a less effective caregiver it could literally be the difference between my son being able to walk or not, among other things. It sucks and I feel trapped but I don't think I'd forgive myself 20 years down the line if he has medical issues he didn't have to have."
"Please do not just leave it alone.  If not yourself, for the girls he has on Facebook whose pictures he is saving!  That is a huge breach of trust.  

I would be mortified if some guy I thought was a friend saved my pictures.  I would be angrier if I found out his GF knew and didn't tell him it was creepy!  Honestly just say it makes you uncomfortable and would he please delete them.  If he hasn't done it since you started dating it shouldn't be an issue."
"Did she do this before you married her?   You can't expect her to change because you say so.   Sounds like you accepted it in the beginning and now are giving ultimatums, I can see where that would feel awful to her like you tricked her!  You are fine to leave if you can't handle it anymore though, everyone is entitled to deal breakers...  Just remember this is your dealbreaker.  You are choising to leave because you changed your mind... Not because she wont change because you want her to.

   (For what  its worth I can understand the uncomfortableness of it.   But it should have been a decision you made in the beginning)"

So how comes they an afford it for the girls but not him?
The existence of this account will cause a big melt down if they split up on bitter terms.
Which he can easily afford!
If that's the reason the parents should have his sisters contribute in another way to the financial situation imo. Only disrupting one child's life seems like the worst of both worlds.
Irrelevant. Don't do it.
"So you don't want to take a day to just be with your wife and enjoy each other's company and good food?  

Honestly that sounds like a great day.  My favorite times are when I can just be with my husband hanging out and eating food.  

HOWEVER!  If you are truly unhappy about this (you deserve to be happy on this holiday too), why don't you ask her what the plans are for Valentine's day?  And when she tells you, why don't you guys come to a compromise on it?  Maybe sexy wear can be included and wore all day?  Maybe she can take you out to eat first before the cuddle fest? The important part is that you both get what you want out of this day.  Maybe your huge adventures was a bit too much in her taste and maybe her lax attitude is not enough for you.  The key would be to discuss the differences.  Good luck. "
When I was 25 I was in a 3 year relationship and marriage was never brought up because it was the last thing on our minds. 25 is still young.
"I'm male, I share beds with male friends on occasion. It's pretty normal"
"I have some advice for you.  First, trust your gut.  If you're worried things are bad, then they probably are.  Second, everything he does to you that hurts or scares you, write it down and date it.  Just in your phone somewhere.  If you ever worry that maybe you are misremembering, or maybe it's not that bad, go re-read the list.

But really, you need to leave this guy, ASAP.  This type of physical and emotional abuse never gets better.  It always gets worse.  Call family or a friend and stay the night.

The whole hurting you to get you to ""listen"", the jealousy, the suspicion, the declarations of love...these are **literally textbook** abuser behaviors.  "
Creepy as fuck.  Run like hell.
"&gt; I feel lucky to have a guy like him

Here we go again, a start at 'icky relationship bingo'..."
"I'm also so confused that they're going to blame her for this, but not the ex. It takes two to tango. If premarital sex and abortions are such no-nos to them, then why are they still being so chummy with the ex? (I'm not blaming anyone for the abortion, I'm just trying to follow the parents' convoluted logic)"
"hey, it must be a really good coffee maker!"
I busted out laughing at spicy. OP has a funny way of writing but he needs to chill out. Looks don't mean much and it's more likely OP is misconstruing the situation.
"&gt;  he saw me one time hanging out with people he disliked and interpreted it as a deliberate act of betrayal. 

that is a pretty big red flag, to be honest.

&gt; he has bad blood with past relationships by his own fault... Other times, he has also been honest to me that his past relationships' failures were also most definitely not his fault

Are you trying to say he contradicts himself on this? 

Edit: realized my response was long and I questioned whether or not it hijacked the thread. I deleted a lot of the body. Just ask if I need to clarify anything.

So, if I could go back and change how I confronted him the first time and asked him to get help? I honestly would just not try. He knows his issues. He has to see the consequences of his actions around him, at least those that directly effect him, too. He wants to change them or he doesn't. Unless something comes where he actually recognizes that he's reacting in an irrational way where you can suggest therapy for the thing *he* recognized I just wouldn't bother.

How you interact with those ladies and what you do with the info is up to you. There is no right or wrong answer. I would suggest asking them their purpose in contacting you, maybe express gratitude for their concern to cover your bases as a minimum. 
"
"Sure, OP could do that. And eventually open himself up to the same kinds of feelings from his new partner. Because amicable means staying on good terms and catching up a few times a year and saying happy birthday or wishing them a great new year. This is way beyond amicable. "
"You know, I know it's tempting and you really want him to suffer, and you don't care about what people think now, and frankly I don't blame you. But let's be honest, your brother is an asshat, with very little going for him. He's been to jail, he's generally not very nice to people and his biggest concerns in life are prom and friends. That guy is not going to have a great life as is. 

You however are off to college soon, so you at least have the desire to make something of yourself. Wouldn't a greater punishment for him be for you to head off and build a life without him? Make a lot of friends, without him, do well in school, without him, and generally be happier that you are not him? 

Guys like this will find ways to make you miserable regardless of what you do to them, because making others miserable is the only way they feel better. The immediate satisfaction of seeing him in trouble won't last, and he'll likely find a way to make you even unhappier. Just ignore him and let him screw up his life on his own. He really doesn't need your help to do that."
"I'd take my dinner to bed and just shut the door. Have a show or something playing in the background so you seem busy

Not every night but most nights. If she asks where you're going say ""Ah man, I'm really tired from work, need some alone time. Just gonna curl up in bed with my dinner and find something to watch. See ya"". Then hopefully if you keep it up, she'll recall that you get tired and need time to yourself sometimes. Sitting in the kitchen/fam room is never going to be a peaceful mealtime 

Also, when people pathologically behave in ways that are undeniably obnoxious, they 100% are unaware of it. It'd be a disaster if you directly ask her to not talk to you. Just dodge it, you don't have that long to go

"
"Can I tell you the super-secret key? I haven't seen it in this thread. And I think the OKCupid advice you got was so stupid and completely counterproductive.

The super-secret key is that the ""relationship guys"" only stay on the market for a very SHORT time. They quickly jump back into another relationship and then they are off the market for years, or forever.

It's the non-committals, the fuckboys, the commitment-phobes, the guys who only want to date up or out of their league, the guys with unrealistic laundry lists, and the casual sex guys who are on the market a LONG time and/or keep constantly returning to the market. (I know people will object with exceptions so I'm including exceptions below.)

If you want to identify a relationship guy, ask him how long his last relationship was and how long ago it was. If you are dating guys who are over 30, his last relationship should have been two years long minimum, and the breakup should have been a few months ago. Like 2 to 6 months ago. I'm telling you, they go off the market fast.

If it was over a year ago, that's not a good sign IMO. If it was more than 1.5 to 2 years ago, don't expect anything from him.

I have personally seen multiple times that guys who happily get engaged, and then have a breakup shortly afterwards, wind up engaged to someone else in less than a year.

If his last relationship was less than 2 years long then he need to have another long relationship in his background soon before that. Being previously engaged is a positive sign in this theory. 

If his relationship history is sketchy or non-existent, BAIL. If he says anything like, ""In the past I've been really independent but now I'm looking to settle down,"" BAIL BAIL BAIL BAIL.

The ONLY exception to this is if it's a guy with some kind of impediment that's so severe that it would be really really hard to find a relationship of any kind. Like if he is so shy he literally can't talk to anyone female. Or if he's been deployed out to sea for the past year. Or verrrry unattractive. But if it's any kind of average guy, do not explain this away. Even somewhat unattractive, somewhat shy guys can get with a girl who is the same/equivalent, so if they haven't, they are often holding out for an unrealistic fantasy, or have a ""best friend"" they are hopelessly pining after. 

The only other exception is if he's from a culture where he is not supposed to date until he has career success, and then once he does he is supposed to find a wife immediately. With guys like this, only date them if they have JUST started the dating process. Again, if he's been on the market a while, it's less likely that he is really looking to settle down soon.

Find the ""relationship guys."" Remember they are not on the market long. I would suggest when you go on the dating sites, sort profiles by who is new. If there are faces you see on there all the time, leave them alone. "
This is absolutely not true. 
"Eh, I think it's a mix of things.  I mean, I'm a woman and when I was younger, I thought I shouldn't say ""I love you"" too much to my SO or it wouldn't mean as much.  The more I've thought about it, the more I realize that I don't know how much time we have together left.  Something random bit of bad luck or horrible accident could leave me or him alone.  If I'm thinking/feeling it, I want him to know.  Sure, it may not mean much in the moment, but if it ends up being the last time he hears it/I say it, it'll mean everything."
Nicely done! Give her an inch now and she'll take miles over the next several years. I'm sure you'll fight many battles in the coming years but it's important to stick to your guns.
"I agree with this as a complete response, but since OP asked for damage control I want to add a few things. Before taking this approach, and **only** if she's willing to discuss it without screaming her head off, you could say that you understand she's concerned about the food, but you want to make sure that it's not because she thinks the menu will be ""weird."" I'm sure she and her friends eat meat-free foods on occasion. Maybe if you could show her some options for the menu that seem like ""normal"" food to her while also being vegan then she will calm down. 

But if she's not willing to discuss it rationally/compromise at all and if she keeps going behind your back and throwing fits then I would ask her if she'd like to arrange a payment schedule to repay the money she fronted, and explain that you would like to have her there but if going without meat for a few hours seems worse than missing her daughter's wedding then - as /u/HiAiNiSi has put it - that's unfortunate, and she will be missed. 

Oh, and if you do end up repaying her then feel free to uninvite any of her friends who you don't really want there if they are now a financial burden."
"Re: your edit

Congrats!"
I think Charlie is unreliable and you should just ignore this. Reevaluate your friendship with Charlie though. 
Exactly my opinion. This is the most self reducing post I've seen in a minute. CRINGE.
"If he actually felt that bad, he would have set the calendar reminders himself. "
My grandfather was the youngest of 16 kids and I have deeply dishonored him as I am the oldest of 3. I have brought shame to my family line!
He is clearly playing you. Get out while you can. 
Arguing with professors in college just makes him that annoying dillweed monopolizing the class time to inflate his own ego while everyone else is just trying to learn the material and pass the class. 
"Op glossed over this very important detail in her story... if everything was innocent, option b wouldn't have even been on the table. Were you two having an affair? Why did you feel the need to give him the option to hide the texts from her?"
"Hey. That's really sad. I'm used to Australian Shepherds. They're really perceptive to their owners' (or owner's, as you said they're yours) fears. If they react that way, I worry for you. Reach out to a friend or family member (or a sympathetic Redditor - consider me one) if you need a chat or help, please."
Doesn't get much clearer than that. I would just throw out the reality of increased exposure to sexually transmitted diseases and the like.
He doesn't sound like you have anything to worry about after reading this.
"Great advice! Dance classes,  art classes, things that get her to focus on the present. "
"I don't think it's really ""abuse"" or whatever, but for fuck's sake, stop slapping people. Nobody likes being on the receiving end of that. Learn to control your behavior. It's like when people say it's their habit to tickle people, or pinch their sides, or teasingly punch/slap others...just stop. 

You say you've done this to him a few times already. Maybe he's sick of the fact that it's repetitive behavior. "
"It's funny because they have different skin colors hur hur rofl lololol

Edit: dude above me basically said this is a hilarious comedy goldmine as long as the boyfriend isn't serious."
"Yeah I grew up with my dad hitting my mom or just being abusive in general. I also picked up a knife one day when I was 18 and found my mom on the ground. Only reason I didn't end up like your BF is because somehow I heard my mom say don't through my anger and instead ran out in the rain. Yet I legitimately feel bad when I step on a snail. He trusted you with something I'm sure he is very ashamed of and has extracted himself from the environment that put his humanity on the edge. Any individual,no matter how peaceful can have  a tipping point. I just hope many never get to see it first hand, it's soul crushing. "
"IMO, there was a big like crossed. Bf bit telling you is probably because he knew it would look bad. If someone is this big a part of your life, you let people close to you know. If you hide it, it's for a (not good) reason.

Also, her message to you is manipulative. She is basically saying ""accept your BF and I intemacy, since it's going to be there eventually whether you like it or not"". That's a massive red flag."
I think you're right and this mad the situation more upsetting. 
I think it was very good advice. Sex is an important aspect for both Margot and I. Would you want to date someone who didn't desire you sexually?
"I'm going to be a bit brutal. It's already over. It may take six months, it may take a year, but it will peter out. This was the straw, the pivotal moment when this relationship ended. She's telling you she wants to sleep with other guys. She wants you to sleep with other girls. She is unhappy with her lack of experience, and that is not something she will get from you. When she talks about wanting an open relationship and you balk, and then she says she just won't bring it up anymore...that doesn't mean the issue is resolved. It just means she will resolve it herself and will not bring it up in conversation with you. If you can't be honest and communicate about your wants and needs then you don't really have a relationship then, do you? She's going to cheat on you to some extent. It's going to hurt you. It's going to fuck with her in ways you can't understand. It'll end and it will suck. I try not to be pessimistic and will always try to advocate ways to improve a situation, but the best way to improve this bandaid is to rip it off. She's already emotionally distant. 

Edit: Also you are young and living in Los Angeles. Why are you trying to get married so young! I too am from small town South where people get married right out of high school and it's so romantic and blah blah blah but come on. Come on."
"I agree with you,  meant this in the way that no one earns the right to yell.I felt that OP was asking if she deserved the yell.

yelling totally happens. but no one deserves to be yelled at."
Her friendship isn't a consolidation prize.
"Don't give him any money. If you pay the bill for him, it's the exact same thing as giving him cash because he will just use the money that he would've spent on the bill on drugs instead. Same thing."
"I agree with this point as well. 

I'm saying this as a PC gamer and a tech enthusiast (I'm a software developer and love computers). If I found out my SO spent $5k to build a gaming PC, I'd be caught between laughing in disbelief and finding it absurd and, yes, unattractive. $2-2.5k? Sure, go for it. That's an amount far more in the realm of normal mid-high range gaming rigs.

But $5k is ridiculous, unless it includes some costs to renovate the gaming area as well (like new paint/flooring, a new higher-quality desk and chair, etc). For the PC alone? I'd find it to be a sign of bad judgement, even if it's fully within his rights and the structure of their agreement to buy whatever the hell he wants with it. I'd be thinking that maybe I don't really know that person's values or decision-making processes. I agree that ultimately it fits within the terms of what they've worked out, but it would make me re-evaluate some things I thought I knew about his character if it were me.

Like your examples I'd feel the same way about an unnecessarily expensive car, too. "
"Plus, if he is being sulky about it, then OP will have to mind him and manage his emotions. She should be the one who is being looked after! She just lost someone very important!"
"Not to mention, why would she even send a link to info about pregnancy tests?  That's an odd thing to do. "
"There is no ""both sides"" in a parent-child relationship where the child is still a minor. There is the side with all the power, and the side with none of it. It is inherently a one-sided relationship. It is not a two-way street.

The reason I say that is that it doesn't matter what OP was doing as a kid. It doesn't belong in the same conversation as him getting kicked out of his home. It's a totally separate discussion. There was one side to him getting kicked out, and that was that his parents were horrid people."
"Hmm. People are arguing that ""she's definitely wrong to be making demands!"" and though technically they're right and we're all meant to be perfectly objective robots, deciding who's right and who's wrong isn't helpful. 

I think she's feeling insecure and like she's never going to be as good for your family as your ex and her family, and I don't blame her. You'd need to have some rock solid self confidence to feel ok in her situation; a lot of people your age just aren't that confident and assuming everyone should have perfect confidence and that this shouldn't bother her one bit is unrealistic. Her place is basically still occupied by the ex in her eyes and she can't compete. She loved you and didn't want to not be okay with all of this, she tried; but now with the prospect of marriage looming, she's accepted that she needs this to be happy (and she's probably also using the fact that you've shown you're invested to make demands). You're right in that you can't control your family's interactions, and her ultimatum can only lead to a break-up. She deserves someone who will make her feel like no1, and you need someone who can deal with all of the ex gf baggage you have."
"push back and stand your ground. no one is ever allowed to tell you whether you can or cant wear things ESPECIALLY your partner. when your partner starts telling you what you're ""not allowed"" to wear, that is a HUGE, GLARING, RED FLAG.

stand your ground, say that you will not tolerate this and that you will wear whatever the hell you want to wear. stand up to him. no one has the right to tell you what you're allowed to wear, and you WILL wear whatever you want to wear. when he gets angry at this and starts questioning the relationship, or making you question the relationship, feeding you bullshit manipulation etc etc then you'll know all you'll need to know about this guy to leave him.

it's still actually not surprising from the normal timeline of partners revealing themselves to be abusive around milestones. ya you got engaged in spring, but maybe instead of that triggering him to instantly say THIS stuff, it triggered him to look at you differently. saw what you wore that summer, and then was like fuck that for this coming summer. either way, doesn't excuse or justify his demands. no one has the right to tell you what to wear lmao"

"I'm someone giving you advice which you presumably wanted seeing as you posted in an advice subreddit. 

I'm telling you right now, from personal experience of caring for kids, you cannot feasibly push all the hard work of childcare off onto your partner and just do the fun stuff because that breeds resentment. If you want to have a more patriarchal relationship that's cool, but even in those relationships there has to be a certain amount of compromise to make sure neither partner burns out. Right now you're under the impression that you can work and have fun with the kid when it's cool for you, and then hand it off to your girlfriend when the real work needs to be done. That is not fair to her. 

What are you going to do when your kid invariably pukes on you/themselves while you're playing? Or when your partner gets horrendously sick and can't care for the kid for a day? Or when the kid is up all night with a stomach bug crying hysterically while shitting themselves/your bed/anyone in a close vicinity? Kids are messy chaotic creatures and you are very unprepared to deal with them if you are this stubborn and inflexible about your perceived responsibilities as a parent and partner. "
"I'm also here to suggest empathetic burnout. I bet she really does care. She's your mom she loves you. But people can get so burnt out with the same conversations and giving the same kind of support. I've been there myself.

"You're getting waaay too ahead of yourself! _Living together_?! He hasn't even said yes to you possibly asking him out (which is a probably bad idea at the moment, see my comment)!

People - like me - say you don't love him because you don't know him at all. You only know the nice guy at work. You don't know him personally and therefore you can't love him. You might be in love with the person you created in your head though."

"Have you told your parents you feel this way? This is something I've heard from other adoptees--that they get treated like they come from a bad, broken background and their adopted parents are the saints who rescued them. People react to adoption in some really weird and often offensive ways. That's a totally valid way to feel, and you're not alone. It sounds like your parents activism around adoption hasn't really extended to actually listening to the concerns of adoptees. 

I know you're not interested in making friends with adoptees right now because you feel like your parents are forcing it on you, but I really think you might benefit from talking to people in your situation. I'm sure there are reddit communities for adoptees that you could read, if nothing else. "
"I've heard lots if men say they wouldn't date a girl taller than them, its selection bias. Its not easy but having a attitude like OPs boyfriend all but ensures failure.

"He is already starting with the ""I love you"" and ""I'm sorry, I was upset"" lines. I have already taken him off of my Facebook. The next step is just to break up with him."
"If you were 30 and he was 34, then yes it wouldn't matter as much. The older you get the more similar life experience you'll have and age gaps matter less. But the younger you are the age gaps matter more. Google ""dating age range calculator"" the see an equation that tries to include not just the age difference but the ages themselves in what is an appropriate age gaps. It's not scientific but still something most people would instinctivly agree on.

A older partner, especially when you're young, is a power dynamic inbalance. That doesn't automatically mean it will be used as such, but that requires that both people are aware of the implications of such a power dynamic and conciously work to counteract it. They can't ignore it and hope it won't influence the relationship, because it's a part of the relationship.

You like your bf and thinks he's nice, so you don't care about the age gap. But you need to keep it in mind so you can work on having a healthy relationship despite having a power dynamic inbalace.

Some questions to ask yourself: Does he often use his greater experience to explain to you how the world and people work? Does hid greater relationship experience make you follow his lead on how healthy relationship work or make you hesitant to bring up relationship concerns with him? Does he request that you to behave or look a certain way whilst explaining that that is just what good partner do. Does he has more request of your time, attention, and compliance then you do of him? Does your compromises with him often mean just doing what he wants?

Power dynamics are subtle, and keeping them in mind help make a healthy relationship. Don't just dismiss concern about the age gap because he's nice, but actually look at how it effects your relationship. Acknowledging difficulties and working on them is part of adult relationships."
"You've got to sit down and talk to her about it. Not in terms of ""try to convince her to leave her job"", but ask her *why* she doesn't want to leave her job. Explain how it is negatively affecting your relationship, and how it makes you stressed that she is so unhappy but unwilling to do anything about it.  

Without communicating clearly, it's not possible to get to the bottom of this.  "

"No, furreal, me as an adult woman before I started working on coping skills and was on medication for ADHD. I am smart. I am good at stuff. I have some accomplishments that seem to indicate that, anyways. It's just that there are so many thoughts buzzing in my head that they'll sort of push other, less interesting thoughts out of view. 

* Like, why I am I walking this direction? Where did I put down my keys? Where did I put down **anything**? Did I lock the door? Did I close the door? Where am I right now? Who was I just talking to? When did I last eat? How long have I been driving this direction? Is someone talking now and am I about to interrupt them? Is someone on the topic my brain was on ten topics ago, and if I burst in without a segue into the topic my brain is **currently** on will I seem super crazy?

* Those little thoughts that aren't big or complex enough to fully engage my mind-- Those thoughts get the boot when cooler thoughts decide to pass through. Tell her to see a therapist/psychiatrist (the therapist, after talking with her, will probably end up referring her to a psychiatrist for meds). 

It helped me **a lot** and I really regret not confronting the issue sooner."
You're wondering if she's mentally checked out after she went on two dates with her ex-boyfriend? Wow... they went on a movie date twice... in less than two weeks..... and you wonder if she's feeling different. 
"Hrm, there's alot to unpack here, First and foremost holy Jesus Christ im so sorry you're going through all of this, while some of it was clearly avoidable.... it all coming together like this must be rough. So ya know *internet good feels*

So lets start off with the least serious of the issues. you and your boyfriend should probably sit down and talk about your committed relationship and really try and iron that one out. Don't double down on promises you can't keep, or go crazy with opening up the relationship. Just evaluate if you want to be together, what that means, and how both of you want to move forward. THEN I SUGGEST BOTH OF YOU PUT THE PAST BEHIND YOU because you both fucked up and hanging that over eachother's heads will not be productive in keeping open communication with one another.


Your dad and boyfriend, First off in this case, im sorry but your dad is a prick. FOR TWO YEARS your boyfriend went unpaid, he is due whatever money that amounts to and yes he has EVERY right to sue. Even if you told him not to, and he posted on here, im sure 90% of posters would tell him (well actually they'd tell him to get legal advice not post on /r/relationships but....) to get what is rightfully his regardless of how it ends in the relationship BECAUSE THEY ARE SEPARATE MATTERS ENTIRELY.

As for how your dad is handling everything, he's being an ass to you, he's being an ass to your boyfriend, and im sure he's super stressed and what not, but that doens't give him the right to treat people around him like crap and expect it to not have consquences. Yes he kicked you and bf out, that is his right, yes he is ignoring you. Cool. that doesn't mean its up to you to prove to him you're worth having a relationship with, that has to be his call, whenever he's ready to act like a father.

Lastly with your mom. I got nothing here. I am not a trained doctor, grief councilor, or anything that could possibly help you here. But i do know, that you should spend as much time with your mother as you can when you can and support her despite whatever crazy things she says (like all moms do although sounds like yours go alittle beyond just that) 

I really do wish you the best of luck, just remeber regardless someone is going to end up butthurt over this, try and not punish those who dont' deserve it, BUT MOST  OF ALL don't punish yourself for trying to make people happy. Do what feels right to you, and make yourself as happy as possible. regardless of what that means."
You don't always have to have something to say....
"Please seek out a specialist, referral or not.  You need the support!  

It's possible that he's talking about ""losing weight healthily"" so much because he's clueless and thinks weight loss = what you want and he should encourage you to do that in a healthy way.  

To ask your BF to not reblog pictures of noticeably thin women while you're in recovery is totally justified.

I think you need to really sit down and talk to him.  Say recovery means that you're going to bloat.  It means you have a massive mental struggle going on at all times.  It means you're going to doubt yourself.  Ask yourself what you need from him.  Is it to flat out not talk about gaining weight even healthily? To call you beautiful more often?

Say that you've noticed he's pulling away physically.  How is he feeling?  What do you need him to do differently?

Most importantly, get help.  Professional help.  They have resources for loved ones as well.  After talking to your specialist talk to your BF again.  Tell him the plan for recovery as well as a clear set of boundaries.  

He probably has no clue what's going on in your head atm, EDs are incomprehensible to those that do not have them.  You need to really lay it out for him so that he has a chance to step up to the plate.  If afterwards he doesn't, then it's time for another thought entirely.

"nah. some people are just lighter sleepers than others. and some people are fine with certain types of disturbances, but not others."
google 'she said no'. See what you find.

She's a co-worker. Treat her like one. Keep the personal stuff for non-work friends.

"Okay I definitely disagree with hating anyone. 

However, while not elegantly phrased, OP is correct. America was founded and built on the ideas of White Patriarchy. White guys DO have it better (AS A WHOLE) than any other group in America (AS A WHOLE). 

So while I'm not down with her hating Catholics, I understand the animosity towards white privilege."
yes. it may be better to give money to grandma instead of to her mother.
It's not going to be one conversation. This is going to take years to repair and you haven't really demonstrated any ability to talk problems out constructively. It seems like your pattern is to jettison anything that isn't meeting your current needs.
"&gt; I just find it extremely unlikely that she would potentially ruin our 10 year relationship together to have sex with my younger brother. 

I bet you also found it extremely unlikely that your wife would make out/cheat (yes, she did make out. You don't kiss for a minute) with the brother of her husband who by the way she has been been in a romantic relation ship with for over 8 years. The same husband who is the father of her newborn daughter. I bet you also didn't believe that she would trickle truth it to you orginally saying that she kissed to making out for ""just a minute"" then explaining how she slept in her daughters room without evidence too back this up. "
"Lol a wild girlfriend appeared! No but seriously you sound like you do want to be with this girl, so you should ask her officially if she will be your super official formalized girlfriend-status girlfriend. Leave no ambiguity! You guys sound cute!"
"If he doesn't want to text me or include me in his plans, that's fine. BUT, do not text me end of day and expect sex. I expect a little warning and consideration if you want to hang. A simple text earlier in the day asking to hang after the game would've sufficed. "
"Once you are an adult, you become responsible for who you are and your actions. 

Fine, parents had something to do with your education and upbringing. You could not control that. 

It is *your decision* tho, to continue in that direction and accept that for who you are. "
"&gt; it's also a bizarre change

I'm suspicious of whether it was really a drastic change or simply a gradual escalation of selfishness as he's grown more comfortable with taking advantage of her.  OP doesn't mention how long they've been living together with this arrangement, but considering that she's only 22, it's unlikely that it's been a really long time.  I would bet that he started out respectful of her food because he knew that he had to be if he wanted her to keep cooking for him all the time, but he gradually lost his sense of restraint.  Hence why OP can't really pinpoint the start of the problem.

&gt;I can't quite put my finger on when he started consuming more food than he should. "
"Oh please stop with the ""woe is me"" bullshit. She went out for drinks with him, and is hiding behind his weight gain so she can make herself feel better. She cheated on him. She doesn't get to decide if she violated his trust, or if she didn't cheat. Kissing someone who isn't your spouse and when you aren't in an open relationship is cheating, full stop. 


EDIT: Stop telling everyone to calm down and either deleting or having your replies removed. You're wrong and not right in any case, and if you even think you are, I pity those you date."

"&gt; it's clear this was more about you getting to fuck your crush of 7 years than anything else, *you all literally do the same shit your bro would do with her* and it's uncomfortable to watch.

You don't really touch on this comment at all, OP. It's pretty clear this is a big source of everybody's discomfort. "
She's been unemployed and actively looking for just two months and you're freaking out this hard on her? That seems extremely unfair when you freely admit you're able to sustain both of you on your income only. You want to rule out engagement for this entire *year* because of unemployment in February? This seems like a hell of an overreaction.
"&gt;most cases she's fired for negligence and poor work effort.

This goes beyond just being 'bad with money'. She's regularly getting fired from jobs? I mean, that's a huge problem. She isn't willing to work, she isn't willing to meet her promised responsibilities, she's likely putting out a bad attitude and to a point where she's regularly FIRED. That's not normal and that's extremely worrisome. 

Red flag, man. Big one.

This isn't a situation where you're going to be able to sit her down and explain budgets to her. She's rejecting participation in the workforce with sheer unwillingness and laziness. How do you suppose that's going to project into your lives? This is a behavioral problem. It's not something you can fix with a conversation."
"Because I know the more I resist, the hastier she'll be to do it. In the past I've tried convincing her not to do that because it's a violation of privacy, it's illegal (well, when you're 18 which I'm not), and how she should have more trust in us. She just basically denies and denies and says she doesn't care and she's going to do it no matter what"
"I think his dynamic is more common than people think.  He is probably feeling left behind in some ways.  That doesnâ€™t mean that you should stop doing what you are doing, but it may be worth addressing it more directly.


Before, you were homebody as well.  He probably really enjoyed having you around.  Itâ€™s like being a partner to someone who is rapidly accelerating in their career while you are stagnant in yours.  Or the two best friends who both have severe anxiety, except one gets better and the other doesnâ€™t.  Sometimes it feels really good to be with someone like you, who gets you, and who likes the same things as you.  Itâ€™s safe and comforting.  In all of my examples above, a good friend would be happy for their friend and the changes they are making. However, itâ€™s also completely natural to feel left behind, sad, and mournful.  He may be genuinely fearful that you are going to leave him behind, or miss the way things used to be.  However, you said that he seems to realize that his feelings are irrational.  So he may very well miss how it used to be, but also recognize that you are happier and therefore feel guilty/conflicted for feeling that way.  (Hence why he doesnâ€™t talk about it or pushes it down.)


The thing is, if you sit him down and adamantly insist that he tell you what is on his mind, you need to prepare yourself for something like this.  He probably already thinks he shouldnâ€™t be feeling these things, so if he expresses them and you get angry it could simply make things worse.  Perhaps reassuring him that you aren't leaving him behind, and that, while you are going to continue to go out and live your life, his feelings aren't ""bad"".  


As a side note: it is also entirely possible that he very, very much wishes that he were of a personality that would love doing these things and that he regrets not doing more and yet is still not able to change it.  (I desperately wish I was an extrovert who was a social butterfly, but there is no level of magic that could make that happen.)


Good luck!

"It's not about you getting him to understand your perception of his behavior .. he will never accept it until he finds it to be unmanageable in his life.  You're also not wrong here .. but you do have an expectation that he see the world from your point and that just wont happen.

&gt; Why shouldn't I call you a bitch? You're being one, so why shouldn't I call you one

Sounds like you're with a 26 yo boy.  

I'm more concerned as to why you find it acceptable to be called a ""bitch"" and that be okay.  I mean you say you don't find it okay and set boundaries but you're still with him .. being called that.  Are you okay with this becoming acceptable whenever you argue?  To be called and treated like this?

I'm not too sure if she will ever realize it was a mistake we have a way of protecting ourselves by rationalizing things.

"Husband still insists that the way things were was superfun (outside of their mess), but yes things are 1,000% better.

"Honestly, I would pick Valentine's Day or your anniversary as a day for him to do something special for you. Your birthday is his birthday, and I get the impression that more than just not care about it he *dislikes* his birthday. He spent 27 years teaching himself how to forget about his birthday, and it'll take a bit more than a few reminders to undo that. I also think it will be hard for him to enjoy making a to-do about your birthday when he wants no to-do on that day at all.

If your birthday is close enough that he's making plans for a movie, ask him to instead surprise you with Valentine's day plans, and to make *that* special. I would also reflect on how to enjoy your birthday with friends and others (e.g. your sibling-in-law) in a way that takes the pressure off your husband. He should be able to do better, but I think you'll get much better results if you focus on a day that won't conflict with his own desires. It's his birthday, too."

Yes you can. If it is not possible to switch groups at this time, all work can be completed electronically. Send her a list of things she needs to do, do your part, and be done with it.

&gt;And my boyfriend is also really close with my twin brother and works at my dad's outdoor store, with me, so unless I tell everyone in my family what's going on, I'll probably have to endure him, too. This is so shitty.

Well, aside from my comedic comments, I would say you handled the situation very well. The ex sounds as if she has a mental illness and is in need of help right away. Yelling and screaming 2 in the morning is one thing, but slapping your SO's mother just crosses the line.

"It's cool that he felt comfortable enough with you to talk to you.

I can see his point: just because he's gay doesn't mean he's automatically ""one of the girls."" He's not, and if you two are going solely by gender here, he might feel uncomfortable. (I should add that I have been a ""groomsmaid"" twice and it was awesome, but to each his/her own).  It's totally his call and it's great you respect that. Hopefully she does too.

He just needs to talk to her. But you can prime the situation by understanding that the ""numbers"" don't matter. Who cares if there is an uneven number? Plenty of people don't even *do* bridesmaids/groomsmen anymore. Plenty of people have members of both sexes stand up for them. Plenty of people have uneven numbers. *All* that matters is that you two and the people you love are there to celebrate your marriage, so talking about this with her might be a good idea. There's nothing weird about having a bridesmaid walk down the aisle with a groomsman on each arm (it's often cute/funny, actually) or having them walk down alone or *whatever.*  It's far better that you each have the people you want/who want to be there than having one of you have to ""scrounge up"" extra bridal party members (who, by the way, totally know they are just being asked to fill an arbitrary number requirement). So maybe chatting with her now about how it doesn't matter if the numbers are even will help her not feel anxiety when her friend lets her know he's not comfortable with the whole thing."

I would say that the only thing is that she might try to use these to bargain with - ""I'll stop drinking! I'll take care of myself!

So just be sure to be clear that you hope she does do those things, but not for you, as the relationship is absolutely over no matter what and you have moved on. "
"I disagree.

Three options if yoy tell her:

- they are still together and he is cheating. Absolutely not okay. She will be thankful she now knows. She deserves to know.

- they are still together and have an open relationship (maybe for the time being when she is abroad). Then it's not okay that he wasn't open with you about it. She will inform you of their relationship then and orobably not like it that he's stringing you along and not being transparent about her.

- they aren't together anymore and she'll be ""oh yeah whatever we broke up months ago"". She still deserves to know that her ex's mom still thinks they'll get married. 

Either way, you have no idea to know for sure which of the three it is, so you should come clean and find out."

"First of all, it's not a very good idea to ask out someone from work. Think about all possible outcomes (acception/rejection), how will that affect your job? I think in 99% of the cases negatively. You said another girl got rejected, what if she hears he went on a date with you? Or what if word comes out you asked him out and he rejected you? I mean your coworkers already don't seem like the nicest people to you so... Could you easily find another job if it would become all too much if you asked him out?


And did he ever hint at something more than just coworkers/work friends? I think he would've in the two years you worked together. He also supposedly already rejected the other girl, so big chance he doesn't want to date coworkers (which is smart).


By the way, you don't love him because you don't even know him well, you just like him. Don't ever say you love him to him (or anyone else) in cases like these, it would really freak him out! Also don't even think about sex and marriage with anyone before you go on dates to find out if you're compatible or not. And don't ask him for sex, he could report you at work!


I think it's best for you to up your social skills a bit first and try to meet people differently than from work by for example joining clubs or groups or something. I also think you have this major crush because you fixated all your attention on him so far, and he's really nice to you. So maybe by joining those clubs etc., you might actually find someone who suits you way better!"

"He probably genuinely believes this right now, but when you delete the photos and he doesn't feel better, it will be something else that he's convinced *you* need to do to make him feel better about this- and probably something more actively detrimental to your daily life than the issue of old social media posts. Like cutting off those exes entirely, or restricting how you interact with the men in your life.

Stick firm to this boundary, OP. He needs to address this in himself or it will get worse, not better. Jealousy is a tough thing in relationships because there *are* times when it can be a signal that something is amiss, but ""one partner having had sex with other people prior to this relationship"" is not a thing that's amiss, and deleting photos won't change it or change how he feels about it.

Look at the conversation about your numbers- you wisely foresaw that it was going to make things worse, but he insisted he would feel better about knowing and made you miserable about the issue until you caved. Now that he knows he's constantly trying to see if men you meet are one of the ""number."" Knowing didn't fix his insecurity, it fed it, and he's taking it out on you.

Hold this boundary firm. Do not delete evidence of your past for someone else- especially since it won't even work. Tell him he needs to talk to a therapist about this and that he needs to *stop* pestering you about it, and hold to those boundaries, too. This is only going to escalate, because the root of the problem is *not* your sexual past or the photos on your facebook but how he feels about the idea of you existing before and outside of your role as his girlfriend (scared and threatened) and until he addresses that, it's not going to get any better no matter what concessions you make."

Realistically, it's going to be difficult to find a woman who matches your drive.  You have a woman you love who has way more sex than she wants to keep you happy and it's just not enough for you.

She cannot change who she is for you.  If you can't accept that, you should end the relationship.  But continuing to argue over this is only going to make sex more of a chore for her."

"Except the age argument here makes no sense.  As you get older formal dances don't tend to happen as much in most cultures. 

Personally, (I'm not that old, just 29), I wouldn't care if a monogamous partner went as someone's date to a wedding (or whatever the analogous event is to a fraternity party that happens as an adult). I also don't think most of the people I know, also around my age would care.  So I don't think his girlfriend did anything wrong by accepting. I'd also understand why someone else would care and I think OP did the right thing by introducing a conversation about it so that they can agree on boundaries in the future.  But I don't think you can call something like this a boundary and assume it is an agreed upon one if you've never had a discussion about it or articulated that it is a boundary. The very fact that people are responding on both sides of this argument should tell you that this is not an area where boundaries should be assumed.  All OP needs to say to not be controlling is ""I understand you already committed to your friend this time, I trust you and if other arrangements can't be made it isn't a big deal. In the future I'd prefer that you not accept formal invitations without checking in with me first."" That's called setting a boundary and there is a huge difference between hearing about this for the first time, acting aloof, and then sending a Facebook message that tells her she can't go or blaming her for accepting when she clearly didn't have the same understand or expectations around this particular issue and where the boundary lies than OP did (the latter is where he is going to look like a controlling jerk). Surely with all your older wisdom you can see that just because it is a boundary to you doesn't mean it is a boundary to other people and at her age, among her friends, this may be really normal (as it is at many ages among many social circles). If all of her friends are 'younger' and are thinking like you thought when you were 'younger' than OP is going to look all the more controlling if he is the one person who isn't okay with something most of her other friends' partners are okay with and if he expresses that in anything less than a healthy way to communicate. 

Also ""telling"" and ""asking"" are two different things. So, ""I know that telling your partner not to go to a formal with someone else is a perfectly reasonable thing to ask"" doesn't even make sense. It is perfectly reasonable to tell your partner that you are uncomfortable, talk it through and then maybe ask that they not go out of consideration for your feelings.  But telling someone not to do something is a whole different thing and is the same as not asking.  If OP tells her not to go and she doesn't agree does he plan to end it?  Now it has become an ultimatum, which can be healthy if and only if he knows 100% that he cannot date someone who would ever go to a formal with a friend and that it is worth it to him to break-up with her over that. 

I'm going to say that for me, as I've aged a little, being older has meant I've learned to not assume I know what the other person wants and is thinking, assume what the boundaries are before discussing them, try to tell another adult what they can and cannot do, and communicate in a healthy way when an issue arises. This means talking about it, but going into this conversation thinking that his girlfriend is being unreasonable and that he is perfectly reasonable (when clearly many people think he is being unreasonable and she is perfectly reasonable) would be a mistake. There is no absolute saying that accepting a friend date with someone else for a fraternity formal is automatically crossing a boundary, just because it is for you, does not make it true for her (especially when it has never been discussed)."
Proposing in public always seemed a bit manipulative to me unless you know for sure the person is 100 percent on board with getting engaged and you've discussed it. Otherwise it puts them in a position where they feel like they can't really say no lest they be labelled a raging bitch by a crowd of onlookers.
"&gt;This is a unilateral decision, you do not need his approval. 

This so much!  You have the total power to end the relationship, he does not get a say.  He doesn't have to approve, he doesn't have to agree, because it no longer matters what he thinks

I'd also block him for awhile, so he can't try to convince you that he'll change.  "
"&gt;Well, men go around topless all the time

Male breasts are not highly sexualized. Your excuse might have merit if the BF was completely naked around women and OP was ok with that. I doubt that would be the case here.

&gt;OP didn't realize she wasn't allowed to?

Then why would she feel guilty?

She knew exactly what she was doing, and that it was highly inappropriate. Stop trying to make excuses for her."
"For REAL. I went to get a cup of water one night before bed, my husband asked me to bring him an orange. We usually put them in little plastic bowls. He found me 30 minutes later rearranging the pantry because I couldn't find the bowl. "
Y'all need to talk about Kevin. 
"If it was just about ""people"", then they would be taking pictures of guys in spandex too.  Also that just feels like an extreme violation of privacy.  I get that in a public space rights about photography/video are different, but gross...

Personally, I don't think I could marry someone who treats women, ""people"", like that, so no.  I don't think you're overreacting. "
"Two 15 year olds will be having sex, whether it's in her own bed, safe, with a condom and the birth control pill, or on a park bench, with hobos watching and using prayer as a contraceptive. "
Ok I will report back. I typically am a very calm person and I know that even if hurtful things are said they are out of anger and the person usually doesn't mean them. This is some really good advice and I will be sure to use something similar to what you said!
"Whatever he can get away with, apparently"
"OP might be the one who isn't on the lease. If so then even though it seems unfair she is legally obligated to be the one to leave if it comes down to it. And would you really want to stay in that apartment anyways, with so many memories tarnished? With the furniture that they had sex together on? Yikes, nope. I'd want to move far, far, far away.

"
"You'd be horrified if a male friend slept on your bed while you slept on the floor? But you weren't even on the same surface, why would that be disrespectful to anybody?"
"FWIW, I find sports boring to the point that I don't even bother watching the Olympics anymore, and I think that your fiance is being a bit unreasonable.

To summarize what I've read:

* your SO has anxiety and has no friends other than you.  He doesn't socialize with anyone except you.
* you used to be similar until 2 years ago, and now you have 2 guys come over every Sunday to watch football with you.  Your SO declines to be in the same room during this time.  You'd like to expand this to baseball season.
* your SO wants you to severely curtail -- ideally completely cancel -- these football Sundays.  It's not an objection to his home being ""invaded"" because he said he'd rather you host them at home than go to one of the guys' homes.

IMO, he's too socially isolated and depends on you to fulfill all his social needs.  He liked it when it was just the 2 of you all the time.  He's feeling a mix of resentment/panic/jealousy that you have this well established friendship with others because it takes you away from him.

And I get that, I truly do.  But it's not healthy to expect your SO to give up a hobby because of your anxiety about the relationship, assuming that chores are done and you're spending at least an equivalent amount of time with your SO.  

I think a good compromise is that:

* during sports weekends, Saturday is reserved for you guys to hang out.
* you get at least 2 Sundays a month to hang out with your sports friends.
* if your SO does not make plans for you guys to do something on Sunday, you're free to attend/host another Sunday sports gathering.
* I'd personally recommend at least 1 full weekend per month spent with the SO, but that'd be my preference.
* your SO go to therapy for his anxiety.  He needs to learn how to socialize with your sport buddies at least on a superficial level.  "
"You seem to think you need your boss's permission to quit.  You could have saved yourself a lot of anxiety if you had quit when you wanted to, instead of putting what your boss wants first.  In the future, take care of yourself.  If you get to the point where you can't work due to your anxiety and depression, things will just get worse for you.  Your boss can always hire another employee."
Then learn something from that.
Just wanted to say you're an awesome guy! So mature and smooth. More guys should be like you. 
"If you truly believe she has PPD, you can call her OBGYN and talk to her doctor. The doctor can't give out information (HIPAA laws), but the doctor can listen to what you have to say.

You're in a really tough place, and I admire you for taking the high road. I do think there's also the possibility that motherhood changes you - not just hormonally, but it makes you very very emotionally vulnerable in a way you've never been before."
"I wish that had been the end of it. But to this day, I still have to see him at least once a week."

Yeah I was an asshole. Part of this post is to gauge how big of an asshole.
"For me, having my husband with me at consultations is something I actually prefer. I like having someone I trust be there to hear all the details along with me. I value his perspective and am glad to have him hear everything ""from the horse's mouth"", so he can come to his own conclusions that aren't filtered through my perception. 

Afterward, we can discuss what the doctor said, and he might even remember a detail that I forgot, which is very beneficial. There have also been times when he was able to give input during an appointment, like if I forgot to bring up one of my symptoms that I had been meaning to mention. My husband gives me moral support, as well, which isn't something I *rely* on (I've been going to doctors since childhood), but I do prefer it. 

People are different. For some, medical appointments are strictly private and they prefer them that way. For others, the benefit of having a spouse present outweighs the lack of privacy. "

"To all the people saying that OP can't tell Sally who to hook up with: that's true, but if Sally were here asking for advice, I'd say that hooking up with lots of people in the same friend group can cause you problems, especially if you ever want to date someone seriously in that group. That's the same friendly advice OP could say to Sally: she has the *right* to hook up with anyone (AS LONG AS THEY CONSENT) but it may make her life difficult later on. Looking outside the same social group is a great idea."

"As an awkward guy in college/university I can say I have done this before. Most likely he is very, very shy and for some reason feels like if you notice him paying attention to you it will somehow draw you toward him.

Some time goes by and OP posts an update but it's obviously the boyfriend who found out and posed as OP saying she made it all up and to forget it and she loved her boyfriend.

Tell her that out of respect for your relationship, you do not find it is appropriate for her to be discussing presents that she wants and accepting them on Valentine's day from other males. This yearly Valentine's present is setting up a relationship between them beyond a typical friend. 

Also, how often does she talk / see this friend? Have you met him or gotten to read their conversations (open device policy?)? I'm curious how this friend perceives their relationship. Does he know about you? What does she say to him about you?"

You can talk with him about the stresses in his life and how the shared custody arrangement may not be the best for the child right now -- *but talk with a lawyer first.*  "
He said he puts in just as much as her and this is money he saved up personally. I don't see any situation where the girlfriend is in the right.
I agree with that. Kids do just fine when they're told early on that they're adopted. (As long as it's not thrown in their face as an insult). I never understood some people waiting or not telling them at all and leaving them to find out by accident.

How do you know that? Most teenagers would not want their parents blogging and writing articles about them, on almost any topic. Same thing for most adults.

"Everyone has pretty much covered it. There is no ambiguity here. Sorry, bud."
"Yes, or maybe his wording is exactly what he meant.

Yes, what you've said might be what's upsetting him. Or, it could be the fact that she's doing it for other men, as he sees it, that's upsetting him. We don't know his mind.

We do know what he's said, though, and that was ""random guys to jack off to"", which supports my point and not yours.

I never said her BF's reaction wasn't understandable, I said it was possessive and misogynist. It might be less misogynist than I thought, but it is possessive.

I agree that in order to move forward OP and her BF should have an open and frank discussion about this.

I'd also point out that you've gone along way to defend something as not sexist, and, if the explanation of ""latent sexism"" fits easier, you might consider accepting it in the future.

(and I'll consider whether I'm jumping to conclusions about sexism and consider that in future too)"
"An incredible dad wouldn't abuse his wife. They're seeing this and learning from him that it's acceptable, that it's the way you treat the people you care about.

"Oh god how I hate the fucking ""break."" What does it mean? Are you two **both** exclusive? How long of a break is it? How much contact should you have? None, occasional? In my opinion, if a couple insists on a break, there needs to be clear boundaries set, otherwise your boyfriend is basically stringing you along indefinitely.

In all honesty, you should treat this ""break"" as a ""break-up"" and give him all the time he needs. If he comes back and wants to be exclusive again, you can make a decision then."
"So, you have a GF who doesn't have her own car, who hasn't purchased multiple carseats so there is one in each car, who didn't respond when her grandmother hurt herself and tried to contact her, and who went out to lunch with a friend while you were at the ER with her grandmother and child.

Your husband is shopping for your replacement right now.  The only reason he agreed to counseling in the past-- and while he'll probably agree to do so again-- is because it will buy him time while he continues his search for a soft place to land.

"&gt; am I an asshole?

No.

&gt; Should I consider letting them stay friends? Or push to end contact for my sanity?

They should not be friends. Because clearly they cannot be just friends.

The key phrase here is

&gt; If you want Cab and I to end our relationship, I will find a way back in contact when I'm in need, and I expect he will as well.

Read that until it sinks in. 

It means that she has no problem being emotionally, even if not physically, intimate with someone whose partner is uncomfortable with her behavior and has asked her to stop. 

She has no problems doing something she was asked not to do because it is a serious issue for someone else's relationship's health.

She doesn't care for your and Cab's relationship.

It also says that she is extremely confident that Cab will also break his promise to you and prioritize her above you. 

Could that be true? 

You'll know when you see his reaction to that message. "
"Is the salary worth it?  If yes, carry on, there's a reason why people get paid to work.

If no, start looking around for another position.  Once you have something lined up, you can have a discussion with ladyboss about how you love the job overall but bossman is making it unbearable.  Best case scenario she might find some way to work around it.  It does seem unlikely that there's a good workaround though, which is where the other job comes in as the escape hatch."
"&gt;I want to let you know, though, that should you want Cab to sever contact with me, that I will most likely find a way to contact him again...

Holy shit, she's got balls. I mean that 100%.

She's honestly one of those girls who is unable to have female friends is what I'm picking up from this. Someone who isn't like all the other girls and is the shoulder your bf can conveniently cry on when he just can't talk to you? Yeah, girls like that are the ones mothers warn their sons about. Coupling this with the fact that she lost another guy friend for the **exact same thing** makes me think that she's more trouble than she's worth.

I also think it's worth telling your boyfriend about this. Though it's a bit unsettling to me that he's telling you that he had the feeling it was weird/wrong but he kept talking to her anyway."
"Yes. I remember meeting a guy at a bar. He said that he wanted to go out on date with me. At first, we arranged dinner at a middle of the road restaurant.

Screenwriter here. Dale is projecting all over the place here, OP, and he's taking it out on you. Look very closely at his reactions to your roommates and Lo.

"Right!  She's complaining about something he really wants to do (school) and doesn't realize how lucky she is to be able to do it.  I'd be annoyed too.  We've all made snide comments before, and we've all had them made towards us.  I don't think I've ever ended a friendship over it."
"I don't think doing well in school and using it as a place to explore your personal identity is as mutually exclusive as you make it sound. Most of my friends in college drank, experimented with drugs, dated a variety of people, lived in unconventional housing situations, etc. all while maintaining a GPA of 3.5 and higher and holding down part time jobs.

Plus, in college you're exposed to ideas you wouldn't otherwise have ready access to. You have professors who teach you ethics or introduce you to unconventional political ideas or get you hooked on microbiology. All of these things are part of ""finding yourself"" that can't happen by selling your furniture, as you put it.

It's all about balance. Many college students do it well and others don't. That said, you're essentially pointing out how ridiculously expensive college has become and, with that, I agree."

I also traveled 6 hours each way to attend his bday party. I didn't know anyone other than her and her family and she was busy the whole time. I talked to her grandpa, who I love, for awhile but this party was FOUR HOURS LONG. That stuff is not fun for non-parents. You are overreacting. She helped you plan the party and you won't have any time to spend with her anyways. She works every weekend let her have fun on the one she has off."
"I agree.  Once u meet the pupper, the name will come.  However, I also agree with Sir Charles Hamburger. "
"&gt;Hey, you can be supportive and validating of OPs feelings without dismissing the lifestyle of someone else.

Sure, and that's the opposite of her experience. Her wants were dismissed in favour of substituting their own lifestyle. OP doesn't want to start a relationship with sex, and she shouldn't be being made to feel like she's too abnormal to have a relationship over that. THAT is what's PUA bullshit to clarify, telling her that her boundaries are wrong. Not having casual sex."
"Literally the only answer to this, is go get therapy. Yesterday. 

I have no idea if 16 is the legal age where you are. I have no idea if it wasn't, if you slept with her illegally. Continuing the relationship now is not the issue. Your attitude about all of this is. You need to figure out how, as a man in your 30s, reguardless of the legality or not, you ended up with a teenager. You need to figure out how the hell in all of this, you have ended up feeling sorry for yourself. 

Seriously, therapy, now."
"I guess I'm lax because he was very lax with me and my actual flaws. I was much more introverted in the beginning, but it was due to my depression and I also made it a point to tell him that as well, and he said it was fine as long as I never expected him to do things he didn't want to do. 

We also met long distance in an MMORPG. So we still play games together, which seem to be like his version of my going out to the movies. 

He's been really into this game called Overwatch, so I play that with him. I was trash at first, but I would stay up late and do aiming drills just so I could be useful to him in the game and we'd have more fun playing. 
He tends to like things like that, and going out to eat at his favorite burger joint. We still do that. He also likes watching movies and netflix shows at home and binge watching things. 


I thought all this time that that might have been been enough, but I think that I was wrong in assuming this now. Maybe he wanted more but hasn't had a way to tell me. "
"seriously, one of the nicest weddings I've ever been to was vegetarian, and no one cared because you know what there was? a FRESH CUSTOM PASTA STATION WITH A CHEF there was a line a mile long for that thing"
Oh thank god I'm not the only one that views it this way.
Noisy neighbors are the bane of living in NYC. If you want to party with your friends go to a bar. 
My work here is done.
A bad habit that needs to be broken is a great thing to work on in therapy. 
"This isn't just overactive IG monitoring... it's unfounded accusations of cheating and extreme jealousy.

I do think you should call off the wedding. You say you've given up a lot to be with her, but it sounds like her demands are infinite. Whatever you do to appease her jealousy, it's never enough."
"I wish I had someone who loved me enough to support me through my weight loss. I've lost 42lbs in the last year by increasing my exercise alone, and no its not much, but when I brought it up to my SO he said ""yeah, but you didn't lose it on purpose"". So yeah. You're being a great guy here, and if she can't see that you're being incredibly loving and supportive, maybe you should cut your losses. "
"It's actually incredibly common. I didn't realize how much until I got pregnant myself. Head into r/babybumps and search for gender disappointment and you'll see so many threads on it. I think the one thing to take away from it is that usually the disappointment is short lived. You kind of get this picture in your head of what your kid will be like, and this includes gender. A lot of people think about this from when they were growing up themselves, or some when they find out they're pregnant and spend weeks wondering about the person growing inside them or their SO. I myself could only see myself with girls, and that's mainly because I am really close with my mother and wanted that more than anything with a daughter. I also only have a sister so I wouldn't know quite what to do with a boy! When we first were getting scanned the tech thought it was a boy, and so I had about a month until another scan where I went from kind of being disappointed to being excited over a boy. I think I just felt like I would miss out on the mother-daughter relationship, but realized I could have a close bond with a son, it would just be a different kind. I realized how awesome having a boy would be and maybe the next one would be a girl and I could still have that mother-daughter relationship someday. My husband has only brothers, so he was really excited when he heard boy. He dreamed of taking him hunting and fishing and playing soccer with his son. A month later we actually found out it was a girl, and we were still both overjoyed. I got the little girl to have a mother-daughter bond with and he was excited to still do all those little things with her he would have with a boy (he just has to dress her warmer cause that was the one thing I hated with my dad when he took me hunting, I was never warm enough!). But going through that short term disappointment made me realize how excited I would have been if she had been a boy, it just took some time to change my view on it. And it gave me a perspective to understand where gender disappointment comes from. 

I think in OPs case though, his wife heard him ""joke"" multiple about it after his daughters were born, and that had to hurt. To feel like your kids aren't good enough after they're here is something that would really hurt me too. And while she might have accepted gender disappointment the first time around, she may not have been so forgiving the second time when they already gave a daughter born. "
"Simple and correct.   Your friend is not your friend, friend.   There is a motive or agenda behind this fabrication and it is not well intentioned.   

Idk if you need to confront him, but you should do a hard fade on your supposed friendship.   It is a facade.   "
"As someone who enjoys reading erotica I definitely consider it literature, especially if it's well written. Depends on the work put into the stories and the characters. "
Please do not waste anymore time and tell her you don't love her so she can find someone that will reciprocate her love. You have no reason to be angry at her for wanting to know where the relationship is going. 
Telling someone you aren't comfortable with something is neither extreme nor controlling.      Period.   In this relationship or any other.
"There isn't a respectful way to do it. You have dozens of people telling you that. You're only contacting her for your benefit, despite skewing it by saying that at the least you owe her an apology. If she wanted to hear from you, she'd contact you. She hasn't contacted you. Respect that. You can't understand how hurtful it would be to contact her after all that you put her through. Your selfishness and entitlement has you blinded. Focus on working on your communication and personal issues instead and move on. You're almost 30. Time to start acting like it.

I had an ex like you. He put me through the same shit. Didn't work on himself either. I was young and dumb and inexperienced. I thought that I needed the closure with an apology and would enjoy his company again, but it didn't help me at all. It hurt me. He still made the same mistakes that he made the second time around when we tried being friends. Still kept contacting me and not letting me move on with my life. I eventually learned to ignore him and can say that I have totally moved on. I never ever want to her from him again. He has no place in my life in any capacity and I'm sure your ex either feels the same way as me or will once she has ""healed""."
"Exactly what happened when I was a dumb depressed 18-year-old and met a charming 35-year-old. He 'helped' me through all kinds of stuff, was so sweet and supportive...until I actually started improving, and then he started tearing me down. He, too, began to have problems with how I dressed, and then started trying to keep me from seeing my mom.

It's such a common story it makes me feel ill now.

Oh yeah, and he threatened to kill me when I finally broke up with him, and stalked me for 4 years after."
"This. Awkwardness is a powerful tool sometimes. 

He is making it awkward by continuing to explain words to you like you are a child. Send some of the awkwardness back to him."

Run a background check. If he's been arrested they'll show up even if there were no convictions.
How long have you been dating?  Even if there wasn't the gaslighting he seems like an ass.  Who waits till 8:30 to check on their SO to see if they are awake when they planned to leave at 8:30?
"I love this, and I'm someone who doesn't even like getting flowers!

This reminds me of the episode of New Girl where Schmidt's mom makes him send out thank you cards 15 years after his Bar Mitzvah.
"Stop making fun of each other and have a discussion about you both ending this behavior. I get some couples do this but I can't imagine enjoying jokingly insulting someone I love or being ridiculed by them. I personally would hate it. I don't think this behavior is harmless and wouldn't you rather much rather be a source of complements and support for someone you love, instead of a source of insecurity? I also see how this behavior could become mean-spirited down the road. "
"&gt; There has to be logic to everything and I cannot see any logic in genderfluidity even if my sister is such a person.

That's not really how human being works. Biologically intersex people also exist, remember. 'Logic' kind of stalls when it comes to the human brain as there is so much we just have zero understanding of even now. I'm not saying you must believe her, but ""I don't believe it because I can't reason it with my own logic"" is a fairly narrow way to think of things.

Regardless, though - why are you dating someone when you don't even respect an important part of them? I don't understand, personally. I think you will hurt this person far more if you keep dating them and they find out you've just been pretending to respect them when you actually thing they're lying about their entire personality. Breaking up with them now will hurt temporarily, but it will be better for you both in the long term."
"&gt;  If you were in school or had another job it would be non-negotiable.

I feel like this would be so much easier on OP.

OP, your need to have Fridays off for yourself is just as important as school or another job! Stand your ground! It's your boss' job to fill the schedule, not yours."
"&gt;He deals with other people better because they just say ok and do what he tells them to. 

Does he have any friends, or just employees? "
"I think there's a big difference between cutting out family because they're consistently toxic to you, or because they did something truly monstrous (like rape or abuse) versus cutting out family over one incident like this. Can you really imagine him being 35 and telling his wife, ""Oh we can't go to Christmas at my parents' this year because they invited my sister and I don't speak to her because she dated an ex of mine 15 years ago."" I doubt that will go over well. Or telling his kids they can't know their aunt or cousins because his sister used to date some old ex of his more than a decade ago. I totally understand him wanting to cut her out for a while, but if this is still going on 10 years down the road everyone is going to think he's being really petty and immature."
"If there's an opening somewhere in the building they may let you switch apartments without breaking the lease. You'd still be near them, but you wouldn't have to hear them all the time. "
"I mean, if her default formalwear has always been pants, even in situations where all the other women wear dresses, it might have occurred to him that she prefers pants."
"Your parents gave up on you pretty easy and washed their hands. They didn't even bother to find out what was going on. My middle kid is like you, he's on the spectrum and he's very strong willed. We have to meet him in the middle and find ways to help understand how he should behave. 

You could start by messaging them online first until you're comfortable enough to meet up with them. I could never abandon any of my kids. ðŸ˜ž"
"No. She should be paying more than you. A 3 way split is not equitable, unless you're like, trying to do her a favor or something. If she gets two rooms, she should pay for them. The fact that the kids are only there part-time doesn't mean that you get use of the room when they're not there, so idk what her argument could even be in that scenario... Like you can't turn it into an office when they're not there or make use of it like you would a common space. 

"
"She's in education, which to me makes it even more alarming. 

I feel the same exact way, but what got me angry a few weeks ago was that she said something along the lines of he may have been TMI because they were homies.

But situations like this weren't the first time, she's really naive. We went out to a concert with a couple friends and she started chatting up with a guy. Which didn't bother me because I'm enjoying the concert and I wasn't going to let insecurity ruin my day. Well he said that she was really cool and that he wanted to buy her a drink. Awkward moment follows:

She says, ""Oh well can my boyfriend come too?"" (It wasn't obvious I was her boyfriend). And I followed and he bought us all beers and then disappeared. I told her after the concert that the guy may have been hitting on you and she said, ""no, he was just a really nice guy"".

So it concerns me that this is becoming a pattern."
"It's understanderbly upsetting to hear someone talking so horribly about you behind your back. There's not way you wouldn't feel hurt by that. It's like overhearing the popular kids in school trashtalking you and laughing, except worse because it's somewhere you're supposed to be safe and by a person with whom you're supposed to be friendly. It's an extra betrayal on top of a hurtful personal attack out of nowhere.

But remember that his words have nothing to do with you. He is spouting sexist and angry nonsese that is a reflection of his attitudes towards women, not you! He has probably said the exact same thing about many other women, and it's honestly a little creepy how he has created this image of all women as cheating, baby-trapping crazy people and trying to push it on his friends. He doesn't seem to care if this image fits you or not, as much as he wants to convince other men to be as angry at all women as he is himself.

So be pissed that he would dare try to push his own issues about women onto you, but don't take anything he said to heart."
"You need privacy and quiet to do work from your laptop. You're happy to stay and visit with them for a week, but then you'll need to be in a quiet environment on a day-to-day so you can do your work. If they don't have very good WiFi, you can also use that as an excuse. "
"It sounds like the real problem here is your lack of self esteem. No woman puts another woman down unless their self esteem is bruised. Buy yourself a ""slightly more revealing dress"" read some literature and quote some films here and there and stop.focusing on the younger pretty girl because THAT is not a good look.  "
Oh yes she should be fired immediately
"Wow you sound needy, woe is me, my partner asked me to do something she likes in the bedroom that I don't want to do not because it's immoral or unhealthy but because I'm embarrassed. If you want to stay with this girl you need to do a few things, for starters you need to compliment her more, especially when she gets dressed up. Your destroying the poor things self confidence when you don't talk or get embarrassed, she thinks it's because of her you stand there stuttering and not because your uncomfortable. Second you need to widen your horizons my friend, she's not asking to peg you(yet) she just wants to spice things up. Sexual compatibility is a real thing and you got to accept that. And third thing buckaroo, you gotta be less embarrassed to talk about this stuff. She's your partner, you should be able to talk about the diarrhea you have when your sick. All in all don't be such a stick in the mud."
you sound majorly controlling.
"Being a trusting person is a beautiful thing. OP, I hope you'll get back to being one in the future, and that you'll find people who deserve that."

"Has there been any suggestion previously that she loves attention like this? 

It could also be that she doesn't think its very professional for nurses to be sleeping with doctors, especially if they are married/have kids etc. This could be a moral dilemma. What makes you go in the direction of her being a drama queen?"
I did live with my best friend once and it was a fucking disaster. We'd been friends for 5 years and it nearly destroyed that. 
"You really should not be figuring all of that out after moving somewhere. If you intent is to go to England to go to school you need to learn before you move what you need to do to get admitted, where you're going to go, and how you'll pay for it.

What you're doing is kinda like walking into a store, asking for a paycheck, and then asking them how you get hired here and what do you do in the job. And oh, are you hiring?"
"No, you need to figure that shit out BEFORE you get there.  Once you're there, you'll be stuck.  You won't be able to earn your own money, get healthcare, etc.  Will your cell phone even work over there??  You need to have a ""get back home plan"" just  in case for hints go wrong.   

You can't just arrive on a tourist visa and decide to stay.  That will make you an ""illegal immigrant"".  Customs will interview you before you leave the airport.  They will want to know where you're gonna by and when you're leaving."
Hopefully it's a learning moment for ya. Shitty but we all have to make mistakes to learn not to repeat them.

"I also strongly suspect she is vandalizing the car. I have lived in some really bad neighborhoods, and people don't just randomly vandalize the same car repeatedly.

What is the upside for the criminal? Someone really wants to damage your paint or tires, and risk getting caught, for what benefit exactly? No. What actually happens is that someone steals your catalytic converter, or they break a window and take your stuff.

The only reason someone would repeatedly vandalize a car is a personal grudge or anger about where the car is parked. Otherwise it makes no sense.

I agree about suggesting cameras. But if these cameras catch a masked person doing it... I still think it's your ex."
"I think you should send him the toothpaste and keyboard he's using as ""justification"" to blackmail you.  The longer you hold on to that trash, the angrier he will be.

"No kidding. I'm a woman but if my partner slapped my mom I wouldn't be able to stop myself from knocking them out. She's lucky she didn't get a black eye and a breakup. 


Stay away from her so you don't get tied down with a kid or wrapped up in her craziness OP. She sounds like the type who would gaslight you into believing you did something wrong when it sounds like you did everything you could. "
"Just break up with him ASAP and rip off the bandage. You're hurting him more in the long run by letting him talk you into staying with him. He will heal and find someone else. And you'll likely find someone else too. 

Don't stay in a relationship out of guilt. It's not gonna last. And you're just wasting both of your time by staying in this unhappy relationship.You don't love him, you'll probably never love him. He's probably in love with an idea of you and not you as a person. You're young. I think most people romanticize their first relationship as the ""love of their life"" but that is rarely how it happens.

As far as how, I'd sit him down and say ""I'm not happy, I haven't been in a while, I'm breaking up with you."" Don't let him guilt you back into it. It's not gonna last. He'll be upset, just do your best to go no contact and you'll both eventually move on."
They're just snobby rich white people who have only ever hung out with other snobby rich white people. 
She's not that into you. 
"I'm taking your points for my argument while I discuss this with her. Please do not sue me :P but honestly she does like leading on such guys. She likes the attention I guess

There was this guy who was into her like crazy who had a thing for her bangs and one day when he got upset, she chose to don it the next day. I just saw it as a nice gesture and nothing more. But I'm starting to think she likes attention. "

"Thank you for the very thorough advice.

&gt; If your managers are smart then people may starting getting cut because it's become obviously people are comfortable in their lazy ways.

This has actually already happened.

&gt; Talk to your managers or HR about what can be done to deal with potential animosity between coworkers given your rise and increase in responsibility. If you feel comfortable mention that your obvious praise/favoritism won't be well received by coworkers of the same rank; maybe suggest that the praise be given privately or with consideration. With their restructuring of policies they also need to think about human effect of those policies and how responsibility is distributed (all your eggs in one basket).

I've asked a couple of times, and the heads have firmly stated that they are not going to stop the praise, and that the others should step up if they want to be noticed. I will follow their lead in this case--I've tried, and I don't want to be seen as insubordinate.

&gt; As for your coworkers, just be helpful, respectful, straight-forward and humble. If you can demonstrate that you aren't out to screw them over then they might warm up to you (even if they were being idiots).

Thank you, I will bear this in mind. "
"Take the high road.

Don't engage when Jay makes a snide comment. Don't engage in further conversation with him about the incident. Either people will buy into his drama or they won't, but you can save yourself a major headache by refusing to let him goad you. Your boss knows that you didn't do anything wrong, and that's what really matters. Let Jay whine until he finds someone else to start a petty feud with."
"Yeah, I've been in a relationship for 8 years and have celebrated Valentines Day like 3 times. Once, I made a nice steak dinner because my husband/then boyfriend was having a shit time at work and I thought it would be nice. The second was while I was pregnant, hubs brought home a spring flower bouquet (hyacinths, tulips, daffodils) and like 8 different kinds of flavored dark chocolate. The last time we celebrated it as a family with our almost one year old by making chocolate covered strawberries and stuffing ourselves with them. (Kiddo had strawberries and fresh whipped cream). And we may have watched a rom-com. 

Never felt obligated to celebrate it or sad that we dont do it every year. We dont do other holidays, really, either.

"The ""Are you a good partner"" quiz from the same site told me that I'm abusive because I answered honestly that I do sometimes snap at my s/o, and I also can be critical of his taste in music (or something like that).

I think there's definitely a range to these things. I tell my s/o that I don't like his music and we frequently tease each other because he doesn't like my taste in music either, but I'd hardly call it 'abusive'. I don't think less of him for his music or treat him like he's a bad person for it lol. "
"Ya exactly. 32 and he's mooching off a teenager, with a baby, on _welfare_.

All the good lucks in the world doesn't make him any less of a loser. OP should cut and run run run because he is seriously pathetic. "

"This really doesn't make sense for a professional contact at all. I have numerous professional contacts and I might know a *bit* about their family but for many the context of any ""relationship"" we have starts and ends with the business at hand and family info rarely comes into the fray. 

The answer here is to meet in a public place during the day and if conversation gets inappropriate on his end she has to head him off at the pass (i.e. he asks if she's single ""I keep my personal life personal. Can you tell me more about x, y,z"") and if he continues to be inappropriate you unfortunately nix him as a contact. "
"Seriously do not go into programming just because you like video games. Go into programming if you like programming and want to do it as a job. That second part is important because I eventually discovered that though I really like programming, I didn't want it to be my career (just a hobby). If you don't go into programming 100% into it for it's own sake you will have a very, very bad time."
"This guy has **NOTHING** to do with your last relationship, every person you meet is different.   Timing is everything, don't jump to growing old together and put that pressure on him and on the relationship.  

Tell him that you really like spending time with him, because of who he is and how he supports and treats you, and that you want to spend more time with him.   Then treat him like he's the man you want to grow old with, you never need to say those words to him.  Treat him with love, honor, respect and caring at all times, and appreciate what he does for you and how he lifts you up.  

I've been dating/married to my wife for 35 years, I started dating her in high school.  I knew the moment I met her that I would spend my life with her, but I never told her that.  I just treated her like she was the mother to my children, the grandmother to my grandchildren and the most important person in my life, from that first day.   All I did everyday was be my best for her, even when I wasn't with her, I tried everyday, every moment to be the man she deserves.  You don't need to tell him a thing, it's all about the how you act and treat him."

"It's not your job to make him feel better. You should be supportive and sympathetic but past that what are you supposed to do about something he is doing by choice. Ask him next time what you're supposed to say or what he feels would be supportive. I like to read those ""what I learned after my divorce"" as a way to notice habits I may have that might push away my spouse. A common theme in reading articles like that are, and I'm paraphrasing, is something along the lines of ""I realized it's not my spouses job to make me happy. You control your own happiness. No on can control what's in your head or how you think."" That's in unfair task for you to, who just wants to see him, to also have to make him feel good about his job. If you being there at the end of a long day with a smile, support and sympathy aren't enough and he's complaining this won't last long before someone is unhappy and voices that concern."
"Yes, but when one person is giving off pretty clear signs that they aren't interested in chatting, I thought it was normal to leave them alone. "
"&gt; From my perspective, a vacation with a kid is basically a vacation FOR the kid, and the parents / adults don't get to just be themselves alone together at all.

Which is why the OP should probably cross post this to r/stepparents. 

Here's the thing, /u/islandinsane - you're not wrong. You're not wrong at all. Your boyfriend should NOT have sprung this on you one week before the trip.  

But you are dating someone that is a father to a 7 year old child. Was the inclusion of his son a change in plans that was *necessary* for some reason?  Because, as a parent, those things happen. 

Or has your boyfriend lost touch with the idea that *he can go on vacations without his son*?  That also happens to parents.  

Did he maybe......  want to ""have it all"" on this trip?  Take *everybody* he loves to the beach?  His girlfriend, his son, his grandmother?   What was he thinking here? 

Uh, can his grandmother watch the kid so you guys can have some couple time? "
"Most places post menus online that include the price.  Maybe next time you want to go to a restaurant, you could look up the prices *before* talking to her and then say, ""Lets try X restaurant.  I've looked at the menu and entrees are about $X-$X.""  If she's still negative about it, maybe she's just an annoying person and you should consider if you're willing to deal with that forever. "
"Seriously!  This has ""but I'm the *nice* guy"" written all over it.  No, OP, you're just the guy who encouraged her and then stopped cold at a certain point, and are now passive aggressively blaming her for not waiting for you forever.  

She might be better off with the brother, honestly."
This is a lovely thing to write for OP; I'm so very sorry for your loss. 
"This. Also, whether or not he takes your relationship seriously shouldn't dictate how respectful he is to you. Maybe the relationship isn't serious, that means he should try to not make expressed commitments to you, it doesn't mean he should treat you badly."

"It really is weird how different the reactions will be on different posts.  I assume the ""whats the big deal"" people are either teenagers themselves or skeevy old creeps who don't understand how fucked up they are.

"I don't find that feminists have an agenda against nerds for being nerds. Usually it's because the self-proclaimed nerd has some issues with women or unexamined privilege (and then gets hostile when it's pointed out).

"dude, all of this makes it sound like your gf doesn't give a *shit* about you... 

&gt;Once again the message is read with no response. [...] I sent her a few messages saying I was very worried and she needed to reply to me as I was near a mental breakdown. She asked me what was up!

&gt;I could see the people inside and it was almost like my girlfriend had told them her crazy boyfriend was coming and not to let him in?

&gt;I found her talking to some guy arm in arm, Sharing a cigarette. I kind of sat there for a moment in disbelief. I called out ""Babe!"" She made eye contact with me but then put her finger up to me, almost to say ""one second!""

WTF @ the disrespect she showed to you here. ^

&gt;He kept telling me I had to leave and my girlfriend just sat there and let this dude intimidate me.

&gt;I almost had to beg my gf shamefully to come with me because she was trying to say that she wasn't kicked out only I was....yeah....

re-read all of this. does it sound like she cares about you? right now she cares more about partying than your relationship. that's your real issue here. i'd move on, if i were you. "
"I think you should contact him once, saying no and telling him you're now going to block him on all forms of communication, and then do that. He wants something you can't give him, so there's no way not to hurt him -- all you can do is be clear, honest, and don't give him false hope. 

Consider: ""I'm really sorry, but for my own mental health I simply can't be in a relationship with you. I'm very sorry for what you're currently going through, but I can't be your support. I'm now going to block on you [communication things] -- if you do manage to contact me through other means, I will delete your messages unread. I'm not doing this to be cruel, but because I don't have any other options.""

The only kindness you can give him here is absolute clarity and consistency. You can't be with him, you know this, he needs to know this. 

(And on another note, it is so good and brave of you to confront the cycle of abuse and decide that it stops with you. I know you're not looking for sympathy, but as someone who has been caught up in someone else's repeating patterns of abuse, I just wanted to say thank you for trying to stop that happening here.) "
"If the bride and groom have already been asking people to join the party, it is probably a bit late for that.  

The OP's first step here is to tell his fiancÃ© that he had a chat with her friend, and the friend mentioned feeling awkward about standing up on the bride's side.  Then OP and his fiancÃ© can think through their options.  "
Nothing the OP said she was tainted for having other partners. He wanted monogamy and she was willing to give up their life together for some strange. That's the issue.  
"I don't really have much difficultly standing up for myself. 
I did ask him if he was more or less likely to be 'randomly' searched and he said less, so he's got that going for him which is nice. "
"Yeah, even if OP wasn't pregnant, him getting so upset about a video game that he tries to physically move her without her consent would still be very fucked up and a 100% valid reason to not talk to him anymore."
"Dude, *he just had heart surgery*. He has probably been terrified about this in the weeks leading up to it, obsessing over it, worried it might not work, might go wrong, he might die! He's probably in a terrible place! He's probably not thinking straight, because of the pretty awful stress and pressure!

And you're getting pissy because you think the reason he didn't want to see you isn't good enough??? Pull your head in!!!! So *what* if it's dumb he was worried he'd cry in front of you? This is one of those situations where *you* need to be doing everything you can to make this easy for him, even if it means respecting a very simple wish that you think is dumb!

Like honestly? If you'd respected his wishes, I bet in a few months he would have talked to you about it like 'Remember when I said I didn't want to see you after surgery? It seems so dumb now, but I was worried I'd cry in front of you! That was a really hard time for me, I'm so glad you were so supportive and understanding.'

Now? Well, judging from how self-centred you sound in your comments, I don't give you two that much longer together, so I doubt it'll have time to come up"
"There are 365 days in a year and you're upset that he spent ~1% of that time with other people?

"&gt;he ignored my messages etc whilst answering to people on our mutual groupchats.

"Oh man, ""EVERY"" issue? Seriously? If my husband wants a dog and I don't, we get, what, a middle-aged dog? Sometimes, someone has to negotiate their expectations or wants with their partner, and sometimes that means getting disappointed or learning that what they want is not healthy/right/okay/doable for the other person. There are some issues that are impossible to compromise, and anyways, that's just a really weird blanket statement. 

That's not the way it works, and a bride wearing something that makes her (in her words) feel unattractive and uncomfortable does not equal ""compromise.""

"I think you need to tell him how hurt you are. And open a dialogue, and you guys need to make sure you're actually on the same page regarding getting married. It shouldn't be an I *think*, it should be I *know*."
"Your boyfriend is a jerk and you should dump him. 

Off the topic: I just wanted to check, since it  the adoption was done between friends and sounds like it was a fairly quick decision. Have you guys actually gone through the whole legal process properly, consulted a family lawyer, made a written agreement, had Jake legally designated as Izzy and Wendy's child and whatever else is required where you are? Or did you just reach an understanding in conversations with them and then give them the baby to raise. If you haven't done the whole formal legal process I'd encourage you to make sure you do it ASAP, for security for both Jake's mom's, for you and for Jake in the future."
Almost all of my friends of color have experienced some very ugly changes in the US in the last 6 months.  Let's not be obtuse. 
"Eeeek, you kind of dug a hole by not denying it from the beginning.  You might not be able to do anything about this specific instance, but you should start an open dialogue with your RA about the overall tension between you and your roommate.  Even if they don't ultimately let you transfer rooms, you should still get it on record that you filed for one.  You want to make sure that if anything similar happens again then the RA's will second-guess his story based on the knowledge that he makes you very uncomfortable.

"
"There's a salient point here that I don't understand. If you guys are in the middle of trying to move, pack, and clean....why the hell is she out drinking with friends in the first place? Why is she not home helping you? She should never have left that kind of work to you, especially if she'd been gone out of town for a while beforehand. 

I find that incredibly rude. 

The other salient point is that she didn't fight for the phone. She allowed this other person to take her phone and insert themselves into a conversation she was having with her SO. It doesn't sound as if she made any effort to apologize for you, or even attempt to get the phone back or tell that person that what they just did was uncalled for. 

I would *never* let another person take my phone when I'm having a serious conversation with my husband. I would probably ream them out, and apologize to my husband profusely for their behavior and come home immediately. I also, though, never would have left him to deal with packing alone. Packing sucks. "
"Exactly.  That was like the entire plot of star wars episode 1, and look how that turned out."

"&gt;He says adderall makes him ""feel normal,"" and he says he can't focus without it because the ""dark thoughts"" come at him from all sides. He says it doesn't give him a ""high"" and he isn't ""addicted,"" he also doesn't believe that adderall can be addictive and sees no harm in taking it alongside alcohol, pain medication and sleeping pills (all of which he consumes every day). The biggest thing is that to him, apparently even wanting to resort to adderall use is ""embarrassing"" and so that's why he never told me. He says it's ""just adderall"" and isn't something serious like heroin so it shouldn't be a big deal.

1) Lying to you about drugs is absolutely not okay. I would highly reccomend separating the issues of needing adderall(which may be a legitimate medical need and will exacerbate his embrassment) from lying to you. 

2) It sounds like your husband might *actually be* ADHD. Get him Checked out. Deciding your own dose is a really bad way to do adderall. 

3) It is perfectly fine to combine adderall with anything you listed. Common even. It should not be mixed with uppers(often). 

4) Adderall is a big deal. Doing drugs is not a problem, as long as they are treated with respect. The minute you lose respect for the drugs you do is the minute they turn you on your ass and drag you through the streets. 

5) I would try and work with him through the shame of needing it. It's real. 

If you have any questions I'd be happy to answer. I've been prescribed adderall for 14 years, and am well experienced with pretty much every other drug out there in an exceptionally responsible manner. "

"Well, there's a couple different issues here. One is getting past him sleeping with her while you were gone (you seem to be working through it), but one that's not getting brought up in the comments so far is the mother. What mother talks about their son's ex to their new girlfriend? I think your boyfriend needs to say something to her. I personally think that it is wildly inappropriate and hurtful. If she wants to maintain a friendship with her, fine, but she needs to stop rubbing it in your face. "
"While I agree that this isn't a big deal, it's not the same as viewing porn. She's generating content. It's not the same as posing nude, but she's still generating content and posting it for public consumption. It's the difference between writing a book and reading a book."
"Fishing schmishing. It's hardly a crime to want positive affirmation from your SO. Even if his ex really was the prettiest, it's pretty tactless of him to say that (although, you did ask a risky question so you can't exactly be mad about his answer.) 

If this upset you that much you're within your rights to leave him, but I'd say it depends on his attitude in general. Does he talk about the ex a lot? Does he rarely compliment you? Some people really are just very blunt and don't have much of a filter on what they say, my dad is the same. Is your boyfriend one of those people?

If this is out of the ordinary for him maybe you could let it go but it's ultimately your choice."
The best way to keep him from saying something stupid is to dump him and find a more mature guy to date.  His behavior is a big red flag.

"You can't change his living situation.

"&gt; 'pop out a couple of kids', 'what he could get away with'

Yes, things you say with care and consideration for your SO. You must be right, he must have been saying ""maybe when she *pops out a couple of kids* she'll be *ruined* enough for me to *get away with* -insert previously painful sex act here-"" in a respectful way. He wasn't casual or flippant at all, of course. You're right!

And for all I know everyone else in the world does nothing except for talk about cupcakes when I'm not there. Saying ""you don't know what he's saying so *he might be*"" is incredibly silly and doesn't actually say anything.

It's sad that you find that kind of talking about yourself to your husband's friends normal. You can try to say how little you care, but that doesn't make it less sad. Because dear...it's not. You don't have to be treated that way."

"I mean, to be fair, if humans didn't tend to prioritize physical attractiveness so highly when choosing who to have sex with/take romantic interest in, it would be easier not to pay attention to things such as if they're hot or not.

Edit: Though yes, it is sad, and not fair to boyfriend. I think OP is handling it well though for now--communicating with bf about feelings, but not talking about it all the time or blaming him for things that have not happened. But this sort of situation and jealousy is not uncommon. Also, at least OP is not putting these anxieties on the roommate--she's not treating the roommate negatively because of it."
"Oh, my gosh. This made me cry haha. Your wife is so lucky to have you. I'm so happy you guys have each other! Mike obviously isn't a very good partner so I really hope I end up as happy as you guys one day. I am leaving him because he's honestly a douche. "
"I've had plenty of times in my life where I've had too much to drink. Usually I just say some embarrassing shit, giggle a lot, kiss girls, and throw up. 

In my marriage, I've never said anything I've regretted while drunk. I've never kissed anyone else. I get sloppy and make a fool of myself, but I don't magically turn into an angry, spiteful, hurtful, belligerent jerk. If I or my husband had an incident like that it would mean a full stop with alcohol indefinitely. It's not normal to verbally abuse people when you're drunk, in my opinion that's a symptom that you and alcohol don't mix, and that maybe you have a problem.

I realized earlier this year that I was drinking a lot and that it was starting to become a problem. I stopped for a while. I avoided social situations where alcohol would be present. Which meant I actually went a while without seeing some friends and hurt some feelings. My husband didn't have to ask, I recognized the issue and fixed it before it got to a point where it was causing real problems. 

I'm not sure I'd call myself an alcoholic, I've since been to events where drinking was present and haven't drank enough to get drunk in 6+ months. We mutually decided to take a break from bringing it into the house and it's been good. I enjoy a glass of wine and can be done after one and feel fine with it. But alcohol is a sneaky bastard that can get away from you without you realizing it.

My point is, if you're getting angry and belligerent while drunk, you need to take a 100% break from alcohol for a good long while."
No she doesn't. She wants someone who doesn't call the things she wants stupid and refuse to compromise.
"I'm sorry OP, but I don't think he ever had any intention of being serious with you.  The talks of marriage and rings happened to keep you around, but as soon as you moved close and it became possible, he stopped that talk, shut you out of his life unless you were serving a function (babysitting, doing stuff around his house, etc) when it's his turn to have them.  They are his responsibility and he shifts it onto you.

Going on family trips with your ex is not normal.  It's not a healthy dynamic for the kids, and it makes me wonder if he is actually still sexually or romantically involved with his ex.  His comment that she will be upset if you move in rings all kinds of alarm bells for there being involvement between them still.

I recommend you move back home and date someone who is actually available, and doesn't just use you as a fill-in wife when he has his kids."

"Start gearing up for divorce. Don't let him know what you're up to and please don't give him any chance to redeem himself, he's not capable of it.

"Man, I really don't know if kissing is all they did.  
They had their little makeout sessions and then just went to sleep?  
I honestly think she may be holding something back, kissing doesn't seem as serious as actually sleeping with someone so telling you that was probably the best way to 'confess' with you being more inclined to forgive than go straight to getting a divorce."
He's not respecting your wishes or your boundaries. This could be a warning sign that may manifest elsewhere. But talking to him when you aren't touching or cuddling is the best time to do it. If he doesn't listen or doesn't change then you have to figure out where your breaking point lies. 
"NOPE.  He has bipolar disorder, that's absolutely danger zone shit.  A little over five years ago I lost my best friend to mental illness because she had a bad night and was able to access a gun.  There are other ways to protect yourself, maybe try showing him this post.  I myself have been hospitalized for depression before (and my friend had been multiple times for multiple reasons) and I want a gun but I'm still hesitant even though I haven't had suicidal ideations in a long long time.  Good luck. "

"I understand what you are saying. I do. I just also think its easy to be manipulated by a liar who tells her all the things she wants to hear, even easier since she already knew her and presumably your ex knew things about her that way. Its pretty manipulative and nasty. Im not saying let your Sister off the hook. Things like this tend to permanently alter a relationship with a sibling. And she is going to have to accept that as her responsibility for her actions later, when the ex cheats on her which is inevitable. But again, as a much older person, she is only 20 years old and has probably convinced herself that its ""true love"" Princess Bride style and that you will forgive her because this person is her ""soul mate"". Thats all Im saying. Shes young and naive. I know you are only 22, but you know what a sack of shit this ex is. "

"I'm really curious what this story would be from your wife's perspective. I feel like from your wife's point of view you're missing the forest for the tress and this isn't a single one-off instance, but rather the straw that broke the camel's back. 

Perhaps it would be best to talk to your wife about why she's angry and if there's anything beyond the superbowl which has upset her. Then, listen. Don't justify. Don't explain. Don't talk down to her (which you do a lot in your post). Really listen to why she's upset. "
"It's not as blase as that.  Every surgery produces scar tissue internally (which hardens, leaving the breast feeling unnatural) and visible scars. Getting implants removed is awful physically (swelling, pain, long healing time for the 2nd time after her first ordeal) and emotionally (if she was insecure about her boobs before surgery, that feeling will go through the roof after a removal). She should spend the money to do it correctly the first time."
"If you're daughter ever believes that there are certain people she can and cannot date, she will ABSOLUTELY start looking for those kind of people. Your wife cannot win by telling her she can't date a guy because he's black. Since she already did, she just cemented that your daughter is going to go out of her way to spend time with this guy, no matter what you say about drugs, no matter how hard you try to keep her indoors, and no matter whether or not she actually likes him. The battle is already over, your wife did a stupid thing (also it is SUPER fucked up that she used the N-word. I know you don't want to talk to her about her issues, but NOT OKAY DUDE), and your daughter is going to go do whatever she wants.

The best thing you can do for your daughter is avoid talking about the race thing altogether and tell her you don't approve of drug use, you want her to be safe and date who she wants but you don't love that part. That being said, marijuana is legal in more and more places every year because it really isn't bad, and chances are she's either already tried it or will try it very soon, and it's better for everyone if she isn't made to feel like it's some illicit thing. That will only cause her to smoke it without your knowledge, which could lead her to places where she'll be exposed to far worse things that actually deserve the moniker ""drug"". It's the difference between her smoking in your basement with people you know or going who-knows-where with who-knows-who and getting offered cocaine and possibly even worse.

As for your wife, avoiding that talk is a cop-out that will probably bite you in the ass. If your daughter does end up dating this guy, or anyone else of another race, and your wife reacts poorly, you're looking at a shitstorm that will end with your daughter never speaking to her mom again and never coming home.

The REAL best thing you can do is tell your wife that it is not okay to think those things or talk like that and deal with the fight. It will be bad, but it will be worse if it doesn't happen before it affects your daughter more. And tell your daughter you don't approve of marijuana use but she can date whoever she wants. The more leeway you give her, the less likely she is to actually do something that upsets you. "
"Here's the thing, OP.

It really, seriously does not matter what the rest of your relationship is like. It could be sunshine and roses 90% of the time, but if the other 10% is dedicated to tearing down your friendships, your autonomy, and your trust in yourself, it poisons the whole relationship. A delicious bowl of soup with a pellet of arsenic dissolving at the bottom. There is no way to separate the good parts from the poison, they are all intermingled. 

Believe me, I know. I've been there. It's *hard* to accept that this person who has done so much for you, has shared so many tender and vulnerable moments with you, could also be such an insidious toxin in your life. Particularly when the last shred of your pride rears its head and says ""NO, I am not the kind of person who would allow someone to wear me down like that, this must be something else, I am not a victim, if he were really bad I'd leave in a second."" And then you quietly adjust your definition of ""really bad"" and press onward. It's unbelievable how easy it is to give in, and no one is better at manipulating you than you are. You know your own weaknesses, after all. 

Please don't fall prey to that thought process any longer. Look at your relationship through the eyes of an outsider. Really *look*. Look at the progression and look at the logical future. And ask yourself if this is what you'd want for someone you care about, someone you respect. Hopefully, someday that someone will be yourself."
I don't believe it's that. My wife is definitely not the sort of person to go for that and neither am I.

"&gt;She tells me she's used to it, and the more and more we see her family, the less she reacts, but their comments are starting to get worse. 

It's getting worse because your GF successfully brought a nice, loving man home and her ""gorgeous"" sister didn't.  That blows up the long-held family mythology.  Rather than admit the mythology is toxic and fucked up, your GF's family is instead scrambling to ""fix"" it by cramming your GF back into the Ugly Sister box as hard as they can.

Personally, I know your GF doesn't want to go no contact, but I think it's going to have to end there eventually -- families *this* dysfunctional don't usually wake up and collectively see the light, especially not with the mom and aunt and sister all reinforcing each other.  But your GF has to reach the point of realizing that herself, and you're right that you can't force her there.

So you might not need to ""defend"" your gf per se, but maybe just being extra nice to her in her family's presence is the way to go.  You have the two-pronged effect of reinforcing your GF's self-esteem *and* making her asshole family's heads explode (because again, you're reinforcing just how wrong the ugly/pretty sister family narrative is).

"This is something that you'll just have to work on coping with.

"Oh I've heard this/similar from old southern ladies. Always said in a very casual way, quick and move on before anyone else notices. Southern scolding is interesting. "
"Sorry, going to go against the grain here. You state that your family has made it clear they are on your narcissistic, abusive stepmother's side and that your sister just wants you to rugsweep for her special day. I say under no circumstances be around these people again. Loving family would support you against abuse not insist you serve up yourself, your wife and your child for more so they can play happy family on their princess day. Do not spend vacation time and marital funds on someone who is ok with your family ( wife and child) being verbally abused. It's a betrayal of your marriage. The only instance where I would make an exception is if your sister well and truly acknowledges that your stepmother has behaved like a vile shrew and is willing to put a plan in place to protect your family ( seating arrangements, security in case stepmother kicks off at reception, etc.) if it's so important to her you're there it's the least she could do."
"People generally, in my experience, go to weddings to support the couple at the alter, not to eat dinner. If they are more concerned about the food choices then the bride and groom, they can go to a restaurant instead of a wedding. "
"It's an issue that I've kind of found to lean either way from person to person. Some couples don't mind openly discussing different people they find attractive together, others don't even want each other to check other people out. There's nothing wrong with either, just personal preference. However, there definitely does need to be a level of respect for whoever in a relationship is most sensitive to it and where that line can be drawn. 

Also, and this is a total shot in the dark, but I wonder if your husband is a little worried about his own aging. A mid-life, youth-recapturing kind of thing. I'd imagine it could be a very overwhelming feeling and could be misplaced on you. "

"I had a similar experience when I was doing a partial hospitalization program for substance abuse/mental health issues.  

The team that was treating me CARED SO MUCH about my mental and physical health. They were so kind and observant. I'd never experienced being cared for that way, and it threw me for a loop. I realized that despite what I told myself - that I was independent and didn't need anyone's support - I really was starved for it. I wanted to be cared for so badly.

"It's not hard at all. Everyone in this thread knows OP's roommate is an idiot because out of sheer laziness he won't close his door. Unfortunately though, damages caused by OP's cats are *still* his responsibility. It sucks, but that's what it is. 

Just think: If OP didn't have cats, would his roommate's cables get chewed? Would he even have to ask his roommate to close his door?

Nope. Because the inherent problem here is not the roommate, but the cats' bad behaviour. If you take the cats out of the equation, everything is gravy. 

If roommate is too moronic to just close his door and make everyone's life easier, OP needs to curb his cats' tendencies. Unless he wants to keep paying for new cables.    "
Attractive and successful woman here. Dating is the worst. 
"Did the baby cry? Did she apologize either way? 

I would be upset as well. The baby was doing a thing that babies do. Was her only option to flick it?"
How is your relationship with her aside from this? I'm wondering if she is using the insults as a way of masking the underlying feelings that she has for you but doesn't want to admit to. 
"Imagine having the freedom you felt when you ignored her for those few hours, but better."
"Dude, she is treating him like a pedophile. That's was way off the mark. He is not to blame for her issues, but he is bearing the brunt of them."
I know right? I agree she was unreasonable but I think that detail got missed in the wall to wall high fiving of OP.
"&gt;She's 23, you're 29. those are usually fairly different places in life,

Just want to second this! Not just for maturity purposes but also responsibility-wise.

&gt; There's no need to go on about your respective birthdays and all the reasons you have for allotting your time this way.

Agree, because - in fairness - she's not expecting OP to plan this party for her or anything. OP could have chosen to plan things for her past birthdays if that is what she wanted. To that point - OP is in total control of her own (birthday) destiny."

"Your sister sucks.

Start brushing up your resume and get hunting.  You may or may not win the fight with your company's HR about whether you should be terminated, but given that you've only been there for just over 3 months, it's pretty easy for HR to say ""you know what, we just don't want to deal with this.  New person, you're just not fitting in.""

Separately, try to negotiate a good reference from a trusted colleague. "
"&gt;wedding dresses are universally flattering.

I laughed out loud at this. "
"No, I haven't. I can definitely talk to him though."
"She's talking about wearing a bridal pantsuit. They are very much wedding appropriate AS A BRIDE. That's why bridal shops carry them.

You're just being rude at this point. "
"Yes! This is great communication.

It's not meant to be derogatory. It's literally about being embarrassed of your body for health reasons.
"yes I agree, get the hell out of there, for you and your baby! "
The part about doing it while she's asleep is particularly concerning. While she's awake she can give/refuse consent (which is what I recommend/other comments are suggesting). Asleep is a whole new ballgame and it's not OK.
"Yes, there is social pressure for guys to be tall. That's not an excuse to be an asshole. There's social pressure for women to be thin, but nobody would encourage a guy to stay with a woman who made fun of him for being too thin just because she was insecure about weighing more than him. 

Life is too short to be attached to someone who hates something fundamental and unchangeable about you."
"Honestly, she's answering every question about him and his perspective as if it was asked about her and her perspective. It's not all about you, OP. You talked about it, he told you what he wants. Give him the time he asked for. "
"Isn't it weird how many cheaters are married to women they don't have sex with, and that don't understand them like their new flame does? They're of course, only platonic, but not getting divorced so they can be with the new love of their life. It's odd. "

"Yeah, it sounds like he invented that whole exercise as an excuse to humiliate OP."
It's been two days and you haven't even started working yet. You really need to be a bit more flexible and give it some more time if you are seriously considering leaving your girlfriend because you felt bored for TWO DAYS. As everyone has said find some hobbies or volunteer. It's only for 4 months. 
"All heart, aren't we? How old is the new one, might I ask? I think most of this comes from the fact you married someone in their early twenties who didn't get a real chance to have any adult relationships outside of you. 

Does she have anything in her life outside of you? Work? Friends? Hobbies? And if not, why? Did you encourage this dependency? "
"The side effects are fucking brutal. But, my life before was also brutal so, I'm in a damned if you do and damned if you don't. Especially because my meds never get to the sweet spot of no voices.

"&gt; I myself however dont picture a future with her, since I cant keep this thought out of my head. I would like to break up with her, but its extremely hard for me to do, when all I do is love her and she tells me she cant leave me. 

Seek therapy. You have an extremely twisted view that prevents you from considering women fully human and independent of you. Your jealousy and insecurity are manifesting as intrusive mental images and judgement on her choices, to the extent you can't see a future with the woman you love. 

Also, break up with her. Stop stringing her along. "
Sooooo....you shouldn't be shocked that people call you sexist when you're sexist lol
"I think you should approach him again, calmly, when you both have time to talk (in person, over the phone, or over skype, NOT text message), and explain this to him:
&gt;I don't masturbate to my own stories, there are others that I masturbate to because I don't watch much porn and stories are more arousing for me. When I first started writing in my late teens, it was about what the other people on the end might be doing but at some point it became similar to my fanfics where I care more about what people think and how would I be able to improve the stories rather than who might be enjoying themselves on the other end. I'm a long time poster and my stories sometimes have quite a lot of hits while others don't have as much so I suppose it's fair to say I get quite a bit of readers. . . . 
When I was younger and sillier I'd flirt with people but it's been years since I've done that.

He was reacting out of surprise, hurt, and confusion, so I don't think you should necessarily agree or disagree to halt your writing *yet*, but you do owe him an explanation. Your explanation should be reassuring to him, because these stories are more of a creative outlet than an erotic one for you. I'd also see if you can find any statistics about the audience for erotic lit, or the users of your websites. Let him know about how many men are reading this kind of stuff, as I really think the facts could reassure his fears about you connecting with other men over this.

Finally, I think you should apologize for not sharing this with him, and for his finding out the way he did. It's clearly something that scares him, so it's something *he* would have wanted to know about. I also don't think it's something you should have to hide from everyone in your life. Your hiding it from people seems like an admission of guilt or shame to him, and to people on this thread, too. Don't be ashamed of it."
"I think you to be extremely blunt.


""Boyfriend, right now you are hurting me even more by refusing to respect my request. You need to drop it. This is not about you. You need to stop talking about revenge and you need to stop right now."" 


Any reponse from him other than an immediate agreement needs to result in you walking away from him until he can get his feelings under control. I can understand his desire for revenge, but at this point, he's been clearly told to stop and he's refusing to. 


Don't be nice about this with him. If he tries to bring it up again, ask him: ""You know that you're making it worse right now. Why are you choosing to make this harder and more painful for me?""


Really emphasize the negative affects that he is having on you. Right now he has a fantasy of relieving his own feelings and somehow doing something ""good"" for you. Make it clear that he is making it worse, not better. "
The only need I see for her going to the hospital would be to bring the carseat so OP wasn't driving her 2y/o daughter around without one. 
"""All natural"" does not mean safe.  "
Someone 19 who is *actually* mature for their age would know to stay away from someone who has a decade or more knowledge of life than them because it creates a power dynamic.
"Yes! He is obsessed, and I don't necessarily see the obsession being reciprocated by the woman.  I'm surprised to see so many commenters judge her behavior, because we only have a snippet of one real interaction with her. But we do know that she politely ghosted him for about 6 months. I think that shows she finds his behavior odd. 

And honestly, is the woman supposed to be super warm the first time she meets the girlfriend. OP can't say anything specific, except she was ""cold"". This woman has nothing invested in OP, has never met her, and probably doesn't know anything about their relationship. How should she treat OP?  

Basically, this is drama created by the BF and has nothing to do with the woman. "
"I don't mean the pooping itself as a deal breaker, sorry, I mean the overall aversion to doctors and healthcare. There's so many minor conditions and symptoms that people ignore or drag their feet on that can get very serious very quickly if they don't get proper treatment in time. 

Of course I'm not advocating running to the doctor every time one finds blood on the toothbrush, nor am I advising taking drugs for every and all conditions that most people learn to live with that are due to aging, etc. 

But you would be surprised at how many people do ""learn to live with"" conditions that are painful or embarrassing or debilitating that are 100% curable. Or, even sadder to say, they find that their condition is now extremely serious and the quality and/or length of their life is now negligible. "
"Um, then why are you taking extra jobs to buy a car and vacation?  Also, with a little bit of work, she could be saving quite a bit on the grocery bill at a regular supermarket.  There are tons of coupon sites and club cards out there.  Try Coupon Mom and Coupon Diva.

I was a stay at home mom, too, and saved about 40% on my grocery bill using just basic couponing and shopping sales.

There is no reason for her to be shopping for everything at Whole Paycheck.  We shop for about 20% of our food there, everything else at Safeway."
"You got engaged wayyyyy to fast. Next time get to know someone for a couple of years first.

I definitely think you should put marriage on hold, and I agree that you should probably break up. Not because of her age but because it seems like she's not that into you, and you're sexually incompatible and not happy."
"I was in this position a couple years ago. It took time, determination but severely lacked back up from my boss. 

I hate to give you bad news but I worked my butt off to make our establishment run smoothly (and it did with new hires) but my old co-workers never came around. I eventually quit because I couldn't deal with the back stabbing and gossip especially when my boss actively cut me off at the knees. 

I hope you have a better support structure. Good luck. "

Tell your father so he can go to another cafe. And tell the manager so he knows that he has lost a client because of the waitress.
"&gt;My mother wants to complain to the manager at said restaurant.
Where do we do from here?

I would probably inform the manager that he might want to explain that he's a regular customer as she clearly doesn't get it and that can be detrimental to his business if one of his employees is constantly thinking every regular is there to stalk her (self involved much?) . "
"Think about your son--it'll be better for him to have supervised visits with his dad where he won't be exposed to alcohol abuse, dangerous driving, and a rotating wheel of strange adults his dad brings along. 

Document everything, start reporting him, tell his PO about his facebook page, and get full custody with supervised visits."
"And before OP gets this wrong, she's not out of your league financially, she's out of your league in maturity."
"According to OP, he thinks it was a grand romantic gesture. I'd say it is still on the table that the public aspect of it was to make it as Hollywood as it could be, and not necessarily to be manipulative.

Though saying she ""betrayed"" him is definitely along those lines, so it's just hard to be sure."
Exactly. And years go by before that comes to light. Which sucks for both parties. 
"I'm 24 and just shared a bed with a friend because we had to make an emergency stop at a hotel during a bad storm. Got whatever was cheapest. We've been buddies for years. Nothing weird about it.

"That ""weirded out"" feeling you're getting? That's your instinct. But you're probably going to ignore it for a while, because I'm sure that normally he is ""very nice"" when you're not having problems.

In a few years you're going to probably realize how creepy he is being, both on accounts of his yellow fever and dating a 17 year old."
"You know what, though? She sees it as an issue impacting the health and wellness of your children. You're not going to get a mama bear to compromise on that."
"She sounds obsessive and is pressuring him as if he has done something wrong.

&gt;am I wrong to be creeped out by this? He swears it wasn't intentional

What wasn't intentional? Being attracted to you and spending a year and a half with you? Why does OP think he shouldn't have spent the last year and a half with her? "
"&gt; Physical features are usually chosen based on personal preference.

I think you seriously overestimate the impact of choice on what people find physically attractive."
I think it's time to go over your boyfriends head. He's not cut out for management. 
"Holy shit, I'm 28. Spo^o^o^o^oky."
Those are friends. Not acquaintances you want to become friends. Giving people pastries is not step one to that. Unless you're just sharing some cookies or something that you happen to have extras of during lunch.
"&gt; I have a friend with anxiety who has done incredibly dangerous things in fear. He also has violent outbursts when stressed. I also have a sister with autism who kicks strangers when she's angry. 

And neither of them should babysit kids unsupervised until this is better controlled. Especially the one who kicks!"
It's literally fucking theft. If the roommates find out he's personally spending their utility money can't they report him to the police? 
"Oh my, I went back on my wording of ""fucked"" in another comment, but damn THAT is truly fucked. "
"Perhaps ""expect"" is too strong a term, but OP should definitely be prepared in case this were to happen."
"It was 14 years ago that I was hospitalized, but I REMEMBER that bloat/swelling.

There's no way that you're going to end a loving, 4-yr relationship because a stranger told you to, but the tumblr thing is poison. I'm not saying your bf is bad because he has a fetish for skinny women, but this is dangerous for your health. When I was inpatient, family or marriage counseling was mandatory. He probably doesn't quite get it (and I can understand that...a lot of my thinking and coping mechanisms when I was sick look straight-up psychotic to me now). I think this needs to be discussed with the help of a professional with experience with eating disorders. You two have been together long enough for him to be actively involved in your recovery, so I don't think it would be weird for him to join you for some sessions.

I deeply regret the years that were basically lost to me while I was sick. The only thing that makes it okay is how much happier I am now. I wasn't really even alive, and I couldn't see it. Please stay with recovery. I promise when you get far enough to the other side you'll feel this, too.
"
"You shouldn't talk to her about her body, because she's had a history with eating disorder.

Words from you will likely make the problem worse. Because they'll trigger her eating disorders. 

Instead, you need some way of getting her into therapy for help with her body.

Realistically, she should choose her health over your preferences - if weight lifting is a healthy way she can work on her body, and not another obsessive thing.  "
"&gt; No reason to cause conflict at work with HR when she can solve this herself.

She was sexually assaulted. I can think of no better reason to get HR involved.

"Wow, holy shit.   

I would go no contact for a while, you don't need to deal with that.  If you have a big enough heart maybe reserve some love for your sister after she gets her heart broken too.   "
With a bully? That'll be a disaster for her
"Yes, but I can also totally understand why she freaked at it (some comments here dont seem to get that) and didnt *want* to discuss it. I kinda sympathise with her extreme reaction"
"That's what happens when you only judge by surface appearance. You are judging her for wanting to dress in a way she'd be complimented? Yeah, that isn't what respect is, bro. "
"Idk, but I think it would be different if she kissed a friend, coworker, random guy at the bar ... But his brother? Whom she knew since he was 9 years old?"
"I completely agree with this. One time I got black out drunk as in I didnt remember the party. The following morning my friends told me the  that some girls tried to get with me but I shut them down. I have absolutely no recollection of this. I'm not here to hi-5 myself but I think if you truly have the mindset to not cheat, you will subconsciously stick to it when youre drunk. "
"He's abusive. You are a victim of abuse.

You are teaching your sons, if you have them, that women are subhuman pieces of crap who deserve to be abused.

You are teaching your daughters, if you have them, that women are subhuman pieces of crap who deserve to be abused.

He may very well murder you.

Take that information as you will.

If he pretends to be loving at times keep in mind that this is a game to him, a game he plays by dangling love in front of you, then taking it away and blaming you for his abuse. It is all his fault; every bit of it is his fault."
"So by your logic, if your friend beats his girlfriend every night, OP should do nothing? "
"That's the goal. I have some really great single coworkers but the question is, do I really want her to be with someone who is already in my circle? "
"Seriously. I think my first response to someone asking if I was gay in a derogatory manner would be ""Why? Are you a homophobe? Are you scared of gay people?"" and then to let management know what was going on.

If a customer overhears employees making homophobic remarks, that's the kind of thing that goes viral on social media and ruins businesses. They'll take it seriously."
"I think you have idealized this girl to the point that it's almost disrespectful to her. I mean:
&gt; Yeah, she literally left her friend/former makeout buddy who had just gotten mugged so she could get a ride uptown

So what? You're a grown man. She didn't really owe you anything. If you ended your friendship because of that, then I suspect she doesn't want to hear from you again. 

Focus on getting yourself back on your feet."
"What she's doing is normal, and it sounds like she's just getting on your nerves. 

It might be tempting to encourage her to focus on bigger things, not get hung up on the small shit that goes wrong, and be more positive. But for some people, this is HOW they let it go. 

I know personally, I will ruminate and ruminate and stew about something that's pissing me off until I can tell someone about it (usually my husband), and I don't want a solution, I just want him to say, ""Yeah, that vase sure is fucking ugly."" 

If it's happening a lot more frequently than it used to, maybe her stress level is higher. See if you can do anything to help her reduce her stressload. "
"After you follow everyone's advice on this sub and break up with her properly, take some time to wonder how in the freaking hell did you end up, at 26 year old, hosting, financing and supporting a family that isn't yours after only a few months? She had you in the palm of her hand. 

Don't jump on the next relationship straight away and take time to do a lot of thinking. Maybe worth getting therapy sessions. Don't you have a support group or friends that told you ""*dude wtf are you doing? Why so fast? Why her?""*. Friends or family that look up for you? You need this kind of support before any new relationship.

Then you can start looking for someone in the same stage of life as you. Plenty of 26 year olds are single and working women."

Really bad example. There are plenty of people who smoke weed and find cigarettes disgusting.
"I don't think she's acting crazy at all. I think they just have ill-aligned expectations, which can make anyone feel crazy. They need to clear it up - it's valid if he doesn't want to commit or get more serious, and it's valid if she does. That just means that they're not compatible, which happens, but doesn't mean that either party is 'crazy' "

Proof? This is not a court of law. When you know you know.
"Thanks for pointing that out. I'm happy for Op, but if he pull this move in a healthy relationship he would mess up. Lying with who you're going out, going for a swim (which could be dangerous) without a heads up and staying out until 2 am without calling that you're safe is a mix of fuck you to your partner.

Good for Op for realizing how toxic this relationship was and having the sweet taste of freedom that he deserves. Just please don't expect to do this kind of things with your next (and lovely) partner."
"I guess it all depends. Do you want to take steps to improve **your character**? So maybe this type of thing doesn't happen again? If so, then yeah, you should tell her. She deserves to know that her friend isn't really her friend. 

&gt; I've decided to make some excuse and break up with my gf but I don't know if it's the right thing to do and I am scared of the consequences.

It is the right thing to do and you've already **done the action** so fess up and accept the consequences.

It's either, *continue to be an untrustworthy dirtbag* or *start today and become a good person*. It's up to you. "
"I mean, I feel like your fiance wasn't lying, as lying implies intent. Without knowing him, but knowing a fair bit about his condition (I have Asperger's as well), I'm pretty sure he had no intent; he just didn't consider it relevant information.

I don't actually think it is fair if you ask him to end a friendship, which you were entirely fine with until this new information came to the surface. Nothing about his relationship with you, or his relationship with this woman has changed in light of it. He has not been actively unfaithful, nothing about his behavior toward this woman that you have seen indicates he has any interest in her. The worst you really have to say about her is that she doesn't seem to like you. I'm sorry, but your husband's friends aren't obligated to like you, they just have to tolerate you. 

Honestly, I think the issue with this relationship has less to do with him and more to do with you not trusting him/having issues with his social life."
"Let me correct that for you...

The wedding ~~is~~ WAS in a week.

First off, don't ever stay in a relationship with someone who doesn't respect you.  He has proven he doesn't by not remaining faithful.  

Second, outside of the oddball ""we are still together after 9000 years"" stories, you are TOO YOUNG to get married.  You barely even know who you are, and you are already trying to plan your entire future with one person who is in the same situation?

Slow down.  There is no time limit on marriage.  Find someone who you love and respect, and who shows you the same in return.  THEN start thinking about marriage.  Life is too damn short to try and rush everything when you are young.  The entire world is open to you.  Experience it.

"You are so much more than some accessory ""hot wife"" to show off. He seems to be completely obsessed with looks, to the point where he doesn't see people in any other light. 


What if.... you were actually fat (You're not!)? You would still be you. You would still be smart, interesting, funny, caring, creative, organized, whatever. You would still be the mother of his child. You would still have just as much worth as a human being as you do now. 

I'm not saying that attraction isn't important to a relationship, but it has to be attraction based on more than physical appearance and it can't be the only thing that keeps you together. 

I think your husband is actually very insecure and gets a lot of his identity from being attractive and having an attractive wife. That's sad - fitness as a hobby is one thing, as is pride in how you look, but you shouldn't depend on that for your self-worth. "
"Or, and more likely he knew he would be feeling like shit, drugged up, in pain, and didn't want to snap or act like an ass."

"I don't have experience with this situation, but my husband does. He has said over and over to *never* mix marriage/LTR's with roommates, because it usually winds up with tons of drama. One couple usually starts resenting having other people in their space. Especially since ""Bob"" and ""Jill"" are newlyweds, and ""Jill"" isn't fully onboard. 

Honestly, one of the best parts about getting your own place as a couple is being able to be naked with each other whenever and wherever you want, or spontaneously have sex at 1 pm on the living room floor and know that no one is going to walk in and interrupt you.

The only way I would be okay with something like that is renting a multi-storied house, where each couple has an entire floor to themselves and no one else can enter without permission."
"I wouldn't even call it a cosmetic surgery. When you're doing it for non-cosmetic reasons, it's just ""surgery.""

His behaviour is abusive for sure and he's not respecting the spirit of the trial separation. Or you know, you as a person. You deserve to be safe in your own home and you have the right to not be sexual with your husband until it feels right to you. And it sounds like right now it feels very, very wrong.

I would worry about escalation if I were you. I hope you have a safe place to go to or the resources to get out before that happens."
That's adorable and the version I will go with from now on. 
"If it were a stranger I'd be more pissed at my SO, but this is her sister. That's supposed to mean *something* even if it isn't much. I don't know if I'd ever be able to really forgive my siblings for that. "
"In an apocalyptic situation your bf would probably be fine just eating you, OP. Dump his ass. "
"Print out the text messages as well as any others she sent you during her tirade and bring them to the police. Tell them you fear for your safety, ask them to speak with her and tell them you want to pursue a restraining order against her. You're right, you need to take the threats seriously. 

While she is incredibly out of line and nothing justifies her threatening to harm you or your family, you're way too involved in the dynamics of her relationship with Rick to be an impartial friendly neighbor like you claim. Who gives a shit if she's using this guy financially? It's awful, but it's none of your business if you're just some neighbourly acquaintance. Also, why the fuck would you vent to this guy about his own wife? Again, if you're only on civil, polite terms with him what makes you think he *wouldn't* throw you under the bus when it came to the woman he's married to? You have absolutely been overstepping in your interaction with him, which has been apparent since you stated you'd only agree to text him if his wife potentially never found out. That is 100% not ok, you wouldn't even add that in if you thought you were doing nothing wrong. "
"&gt; Or should I just give her a free pass once in a while till she finds a way to move past it all?

Absolutely not. This is your house. You own it. You pay the mortgage. It is not her house. She sold it. She doesn't pay jack shit.

Ergo, you get 100% of the say and she gets 0%. If keeping the house exactly how she wanted it to be meant that much to her, she shouldn't have sold it.

Tell her firmly that she is not welcome to come over, and you aren't comfortable with her coming up *your* driveway to visit *your* house and see *your* gardens. Use the term ""my house"" and its derivatives as frequently as you can. Who cares if it turns ugly? Both the law and common sense are on your side. "
"Look at this from her point of view for a moment. You agreed to the meeting. You seemingly went along with everything she said. In her mind, this was probably a condition of buying the property. I'm not saying she's right or reasonable about that, but if she really believes that there were some strings attached to the deal and that you were fine with that, it's easy to understand why she's acting the way she is now. So I think you need to acknowledge your part in this; you played along with her to get what you wanted, and now you really shouldn't be surprised that she's under a false impression about how you're going to handle the situation going forward. If you're going to talk to her about this, I think you need to start with that--by saying, ""I know how much this property means to you and that you wanted to leave it in good hands. I'm sorry if we gave you the wrong impression during the meeting. We didn't expect that you would want to keep visiting."" Then explain that you value your privacy, ask her and her family to respect that, etc. Of course, you have the right to put the up the gate, tell her she's trespassing, etc. But if you really want to live in peace, you'll have to use some empathy and diplomacy. "
If my wife doesn't believe me after that then I give up. I don't know what else I could possibly do if she doesn't believe me or care after all that. 
"Well the price is reasonable and probably a deal since they are being discontinued.

Why did you agree to buy the wrong size?  Thats on you."
"  To piggyback a little on the edit.... If you're itching for commitment from someone, it might not be the fact you want to wait to have sex that's putting some men off, but rather a ""I wanna get married and have your babies by next year!"" vibe that can be kinda scary....for anyone. 

That's just a shot in the dark, because if there's a good mutual spark with a decent human being, 1-2 months isn't that long to wait to have sex. It might feel too fast to give someone serious realtionship status commitment though. "
"She isnt being paranoid.  It is normal behaviour.  Right now she has so many ""mama bear"" hormones coarsing through her blood that you cant even imagine.

Lots of things can happen to a newborn.  They are totally helpless and can and do die in their sleep. 

I was paranoid as fuck if my son didnt cry for 2 hours.  Figured he must be dead.  Griding me teeth at night stressing about it haha.

Dont miss those days...."
try sub r/raisedbynarcissists 
I kind of want to cross stitch that for you. 
"21 and 22? 11 month relationship? You have years to find someone who has more compatible life goals. I was like your boyfriend in that nothing was getting in between me and my education and career. I broke off an engagement with a man who was family-oriented and did not want me to move to the U.K. to pursue and incredible opportunity for graduate studies. As you might know, visas to the U.K. are already a pain to get... it was hard, but we had a bittersweet last few months together before I left living in the moment and enjoying each others' company. 

He is currently married with 2 children and seems incredibly fulfilled."
"Well, as one of the few regular posters here who doesn't think infidelity always means ""end it"" - it's hard for me to know what you're trying to save here. 

I don't know how you could ever really trust him again. Him flipping out because you have a PoF account when you kicked him out for cheating is just the icing on the cake: that, to me, indicates a lack of self-awareness and a lack of any sense of understanding basic reality, and to me, strongly indicates that he just doesn't ""get it."" 

I think maybe the best choice is to end it and figure out how to be productive co-parents together. That might even make your relationship easier since you would no longer have expectations of each other (that he clearly can't meet). It's *okay* to get divorced. 

What value would he really be bringing into your life as your husband as opposed to merely a co-parent? "
"&gt; The wedding isn't about me 

It literally exactly is.

Your mother's a selfish witch and you're better off without her. Honestly, you should advise your dad to say ""good""."
"Seconding the ""second"" up there! 

When my spouse's father's sister approached us about getting back in touch, I was tasked with being the contact person. One of the conditions was that (since she was still in very minimal contact with her brother) she not pass on any information about us. That was necessary to make us comfortable having a relationship with her. OP, please take that seriously. 
"
OP this cant be the first time shes been like this?
"&gt; I'd guess he's not gonna make anything official for at least five years.

Why 5 years? That's quite a long time.

Sounds like he hasn't grown up."
"That's the vibe I got as well. 

He doesn't want her to have any inappropriate feelings for a good guy ""friend"", like he totally doesn't for his good gal ""friend"" "
"It wasn't canceled. She did spend Thursday with him, he just felt the romance was ruined by cousins coming over. That doesn't count as time to herself at all."

"&gt; She wanted a second car, so we got one.

Why are you characterizing yourself as so out of control in this decision?"
"Look, you can remain close friends with the family, I'd dare say, without taking the responsibility for your unemployed ex-girlfriend's child.  You're offering visits, enjoyable time, and general paternal interest to her daughter.  Not to mention what sounds like the vast majority of the financial support they get.  And it gives the mother a meaningful break from parenting, though I'm not sure she does much of that in the first place.

I'm really unsure of why a termination would leave your ex-girlfriend infertile, though at this point I'm not sure exactly how her not having more kids is a problem.  

I get the feeling that the truth is not in your ex-girlfriend and her daughter remains her hook into you.

I would not consent to the ""face saving"" thing.  You want to explain to your stepdaughter why you aren't with her mother after getting her pregnant?  'cause you know she'd tell the kid."
"If she's 29 and is this careless/clueless bail

Holy shit, your financial future will suck if you don't."
"You sound like you're making a mountain out of a molehill, and at that a mountain that makes your girlfriend feel like shit simply for enjoying herself. "
"I wouldn't call them ""insane"" because I think that would automatically put them on the defense by insulting them"
The food part. Bringing a pastry/food item from home specifically to give someone along with the note? That's too much.
"Ok, enjoy your property damage because you're afraid of a weirdo.  "
"You've left out some important info here -- how does your girlfriend feel about the situation? Surely she can shed light on her family's reaction? You really shouldn't be in the dark about her feelings here...if you're going to court against her brother, you need to know whether you have her support. "
"You are literally being held hostage. This is one of the most frightening posts I've ever read on this sub. You've spent the past decade cut off from the world. You need to find a lawyer, they can help you stay safe."
"It was partially the painkillers and general sleep-deprived delirium, but when they let me go home with my baby I was actually startled. ""Wait, we get to keep him? Are you sure?"""
"Honestly I don't want to get anyone like the police involved, I'm pissed that he touched me but I don't want him arrested or anything. I'll just tell him I never want to see him again and if he tries to contact me I'll tell the police what happened."
"She definitely lashed out inappropriately. 

But i too wonder if you're being 100% honest on the amount of time you spend playing video games, not just in your post but to yourself.

It also sounds like you may be more introverted, needing time to recharge solo. She sounds more extroverted in that she prefers to recharge with other people. That can be very frustrating for both parties.

I liked what someone else said about coming up with a compromise that you both can truly agree to without resenting the other person. Honestly, thats what my bf and I've had to do in regards to this kind of situation. Although we are both extremely introverted and play games together, he definitely can play games for 8 hours straight. Which he does do, just not everyday. Its all about balance.  "

"He gave you the money to buy a wedding dress. You bought a wedding dress. As the money was a gift to you you are not obligated to return it.

However law is not necessarily what you should do.

Since you're not getting married you can tell him that since you fulfilled expectations by buying a wedding dress, he has two options.

1. accept the price you can get for reselling the dress
2. give him the dress and tell him he can try and sell it.

Do NOT agree to anything that implies the money was a loan or a repayment plan. If you agree to a repayment plan you may may actually be creating a situation where he has a legal claim on the money"
Great job. I was thinking about this post again recently. Im glad it worked out for you.
"Why can't he keep his job and do the rapping as a hobby on the weekends?

RED FLAG OP. You say this guy is smart. Well, I think he's a huge idiot. No honest to goodness intelligent person would think that quitting a stable job and income to become a rapper is a good idea. So what does he expect to write a mind breaking album in a week and sell a million copies? 10k is a lot but not when you have no income coming in. You're going to be footing the bills FAST.

RUN. RUN AWAY. Or try to talk some sense into him."
"You have no idea what the notes are.  They could be anything, random thoughts that may or may not be rational, thoughts for a song or book idea, a friends delima, I mean gosh this is her personal space and you are being a really odd person for violating that.   I would absolutely hate it if anyone tried dissecting me from a tiny sliver of random thoughts I had.

  Not to mention, you must not be ""pretty open with each other"" if you didn't bring this up with her immediately and went to strangers first while spending so much time trying to analyze her personal private notes.   :("

Ew.  Way to be part of the problem.
"I also keep all the reciepts and bus tickets and snack wrappers from the last few weeks.

It's for emergencies. It's nothing to do with me being a handbag slob who always forgets to clean it out, honest!"
Exactly it can be a character assassination that helps your case honestly.
"Her ex wasn't worried about not getting too close too fast with that woman. If she wants to have fun with her co-worker, she can. She already knows him, says they have things in common, and I doubt she intends to sleep with him while out on a roller coaster ride, but if she feels like it, why the heck not?"
"Maybe you need to spend less time with him when he's brooding. That's how he's learned to deal with his emotions. Trying to get him to change it is a big ask. It would be a lot of long, imperfect work even if he did want to change, which he doesn't. So maybe when he's triggering your anxiety, you should leave and come back later."
"She sounds like an idiot and frankly you do, too. Neither of you are ready for an adult relationship. "
"This. It would be one thing if the last election was about, you know, politics, and not basic human rights, but it wasn't. It would be one thing if you argued about federal v. state power, about economics, etc. But you are arguing about (again) basic human rights. "

Yeah... but you mind.
"If a man doesn't tell his friends and family about you, you don't matter to him. Not that he has to describe the way your face crinkles when you smile or talk about your favorite type of tea, but people should know you're a couple. He's hiding something, potentially another woman. See if a friend can give you access to his accounts by looking at their phone."
"Alright, it sounds like you've accepted what could happen. Just remember that you can change your mind. What if he brings home a new boyfriend for Spring Break? What if he comes back in the summer and doesn't want to be romantic with you?

I just don't want you to get hurt. It sounds like you've built a relationship that is almost designed to leave you emotionally stranded."
"Please run ... I'm her age, and could never imaging touching a 19-year-old with a 10-foot pole. No offense meant to you ... that's more to say, she's not a mentally healthy person. Plus, a 30-year-old ADULT doesn't throw hissy fits over their birthday. You calling it a ""big big deal"" is understandable since you're 19 and haven't even hit 2-1 yet; most people who are 30 understand it's viewed as a milestone, but in the grand scheme of things no one really cares."
"&gt;oppositional personality disorder.

Is everything a ""disorder"" these days? He's a piece of shit loser. That's a personality trait, not a disorder. "

"I would disagree with the statement that children who hit have been exposed to violence. Sometimes, when a child doesn't know how to express themselves or their needs, that's what they resort to. Obviously still disordered action, but not always the sign of experiencing violence. "
For Christ's sake are people on here 19? I'm 45. My husband is 55. Neither of us ever would think this was appropriate. We didn't grow up in the 1950s.

I know my friend in the UK was able to get into a kind of halway home with assisted living options obe she was out of a higher security institution. Maybe that would be an option?

Probably to change her flight rather than book a new one.
"Yeah, I think this is the key.  My husband has mostly female friends and I have mostly male friends (he just gets along really well with women and I happen to get along really well with men).  As a result, we both end up hanging out one-on-one with single members of the opposite sex fairly often, sometimes in bars (because that's where the game is or the drinks or or whatever).  

But I would be lying if I said we never ended up hanging out with people who didn't quite get the friendships we were offering were just that: friendships.  I've had to mention to my husband that I thought a married coworker of his wasn't getting the right impression, and I've had to put some friends at arms length until they realized I wasn't interested romantically.  

One of the ways we adjusted our behavior to keep other people's misunderstandings at a minimum is to a) introduce each other as a couple as soon as we could manage it and b) go from groups to individual hanging out, not straight from total stranger to night out at the bar like OP."
I think people are just confused about the whole thing. If people are giving you dirty looks all day and the principal sent you to her house for accidentally breaking an art project then you're now attending a bizarre school. Are you sure they're giving you dirty looks instead of just trying to figure out who the new kid is?
"Kids notice more about your relationship than you realise, just because you don't fight infront of them doesn't mean they don't notice your body language.

Two people who have serious issues between each other will act different compared to how you act to others, they may even see this as normal behaviour for people in love which could warp their own love lives later in life.

Your kids will be stronger for understanding sometimes things don't work out and will see you working towards happiness for both yourself and them."
