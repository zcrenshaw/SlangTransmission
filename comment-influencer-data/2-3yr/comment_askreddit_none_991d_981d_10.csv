"&gt; Again i must make it clear i am not in any way showing any support for any political ideology.

Nah dude your right they just messed communism up because, you know- it really works."
"And that's why people consider UBI socialism by a different name. If we take all of the assumptions, shibboleths, and incomplete arguments in that essay as true, then there's really no reason to bother with the veneer of capitalism you describe. You're already giving people a blank cheque to the productivity of others. 

And the irony is, I don't actually dismiss the idea of UBI out of hand. I think there's plenty of good arguments to make for it from a pro-capitalist POV. Especially if you've read Henry George and recognize the role raw land value plays in modern economies. 

But your arguments quite frankly stink because they're utterly unconvincing to anyone who doesn't share your world view. I would go over them in detail and refute specific points (like the fact that the 95% New Deal era tax rate is incredibly misleading due to loopholes and different tax treatment), but it's a busy time of year.

All the hideous fat and slut shamers crawling through the sewers of Reddit!!! These horrible people are disgusting!!!!!! Everyone needs to be sex and body positive!!!!!!! Fat is beautiful!!!!!! Love yourself!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I am an introvert, but I don't hate seeing friends...

I don't think introvert has to be anti-social."
"Well I would want to beat the shit outta you for that if it was my girlfriend and going on behind my back and didn't give off a completely innocent vibe... So I'd say that some might mind if they aren't aware... Might wanna cut that out or at least be sure they are cool with it. Some people aren't as okay with others being physical with their SO and play fighting can have a kinda implicitly sexual vibe. This would be amplified in their minds if they felt it was a secretive sort of thing and it could well cross someones boundaries into inappropriate. 

Edit: to clarify what I meant."
Oh fuck off with that shit already

Close the door as fast as possible lol. Fuck shitty kids and parents that raise shitty kids."
it really is just a good thing imo because its a step towards the end of the radical and authoritarian left's reign over us.

"Jackson doesn't deserve to be compared to Trump, he was a really great president besides the trail of tears and his general treatment of natives, which wasn't out of the ordinary for the period. "

so the mods are overreacting with this thread...what's new
"That early in you absolutely can tell. All she needs is one missed period in the first month, or even 5-7 days BEFORE your FIRST missed period for the more sensitive preg tests. "
"Its still worth trying though. The game isnt outright horrible. Games aren't a product, they're an experience; reviews are worthless. "
"Anorexia is abnormal because it goes against the human instinct of survival. Asexuality is abnormal because it goes against the human instinct to further drive the survival of the human race. People with diseases should not be put on pedestals and babyed and lied to, they are adults who seek the truth.

I am just trying to have a (re)productive conversation here.

Merry Christmas!!!!!"

Amazing. The complete self delusion is quite an achievement for someone that is obviously not stupid.

"It was a thread that was featured in some news article (Washington Post I think). I don't think it was ""just a joke"" or whatever his lame excuse was. It was to make himself look better. "
clearly you know nothing about pressure points or the nervous system.
Thats what reddit wants you to believe

"Trump won because American electoral system is biased towards rural power, and rural people are less educated. Uneducated people is Trump's primary demographic. Combined with democratic apathy because of Hilary's primary shenanigans."

She is probably retired and you should consider that part of your job. Having that attitude towards older people is not cool. Narcissism is not a good career skill. Just saying. Make an effort next time with customer service.

"Sexual assault my fucking ass. If women did this to ME without me inviting it, I would LOVE it if women did that to me! In fact I would want women to do this to me EVERY TIME I GO OUT. I would WELCOME IT. This is like a DREAM if this happened to me!

And don't say ""hurrdurr wut if men did it"" that's a false equivalency. Men are not the sex I'm attracted to, I am straight, so of course I wouldn't like it if men did this with me. However, if I were a gay guy, then hell yes I would love it just the same if random men did this to me. I would WELCOME it."

"There's a reason most of the innovation and advances in health care comes from the US.  If you don't have an incentive to make better treatments and methods, you don't get as much accomplished.  That's why no one goes to Sweden for advances in healthcare, they come to the US."
I don't know lol take your pick. Just don't expect everyone else to change their way of life because you don't like it.
