I thought it was weird making a 13 year old cry from my sick burns
I can only imagine the amount of dried jizz between those.
"You say ""my eyes are up here"" to yourself in the mirror "
"Currently the age limit is at 13, we've been having talks for a while about increasing the age limit, I'll bring it up to the team again because I personally agree it should be increased."
"I am in full support of raising the age limit, but when I see multiple posts from the same OP and they're all school kids, I wonder if it's just a bully that goes around school getting others to do it, and some kids get pressured into it. If they don't do it they're a ""pussy"" or whatever. 

I sometimes look at the OPs history and notice dozens of roastme posts of insecure kids who may not know what they've gotten into."
"Was it really dissapointing after your professor promised you an ""A"" if you slept with him and then he gave you that lousy piece of art on your wall?"
"The wood paneling says ""trailer"" your cleavage says ""trash"".
"
"Personally, I feel like 16 should be the minimum allowable age. Children in the 13-16 bracket are still too young to get the full consequences of the brutalization that can come out of a roast. "

it's only weird because you jerk off with their tears instead of storing them for cooking with.
Pro tip: hide your anal plug before taking a photo. 
Looks like your face is the reason why Lowe's was sold out of paint today.
I think this is a good move. Too many kids on here posting their classmates which is just bullying in my book. Good job on the rule change guys!
Your face is so oily the US will probably fight a war over it.
You look like that bacon-haired asshole from Doug
You look like you molest cats.
Run a black light over them and you'd probably have enough material for an entire season of CSI.

"You probably haven't been outside for a few months, it's a little toasty. Don't worry, I only know because my current occupation requires standing behind that gas station. If you ever do decide to face the world and leave your moms house, I only charge $5 for first time customers. ;)"
You look like a dude trying to be a chick who wants to be a dude.
You look like someone with opinions that no one cares about.

"Even though she swallows her name was Betty McSpitt, a girl with a forehead as big as her tits"
OH HONEY....the last time I checked a habit isn't a business
"And it's always the same goddamn title:  ""He said he's unroastable. Prove hin wrong!""  We need a rule that you have to include a bunch of info in your title that we can work with, otherwise every roast is nothing but ""hurr durr you have small tits"" or ""hurr durr you're gay."""
i bet the other 53 selfies you took perfecting that stupid face and deliberate bra/shirt tell the real story here
You look like an NPC that everyone tries to avoid talking to. 
"first i thought that was a compliment, then i realized that you mean shes stupid. then i realized i am stupid too"
You realize the foundation on your face doesn't need to be as thick as the foundation on your house right?
"I agree, I can't see people wanting to touch you."
Maybe she can store water in that fucking reservoir she has in the middle of her face after she finishes eating corn through a fence

"I can imagine it being worse than bullying at schools. Kids only go so far with their creativity but the roasts in this sub are straight up savage. Great if you're asking for it, not so great if you are a 13 year old with low self esteem."

I've never seen a full beard on someone and still mistaken them for a woman. 
What's your tumblr?
That fucking title... What's more annoying is that reddit takes the bait so fucking easy and upvotes it to the frontpage when it oftentimes is just some dude with glasses.

Looks like that push up bra supports a lot more than your family did.

"40s are kicking in big time.

Short hair: Because that's less work for the dye job hiding all the grey stuff. 

Angle: makes us look at your boobs and not the thick thighs or the bulging gut. Gotta market what you can.

Expression: a half-smile because not doing it would show your Resting Bitch Face and smiling too much would transform your face into a map of the Amazon Basin."

"Yeah, I've always felt 13 was too young.  I know if I had gotten pressured to post here at age 14-15 and read the comments it would've kept me up at night--I was not a very confident teen."
"We'll use our best judgement in the modqueue, and rely on user reports as a second opinion. We couldn't figure out any way to reliably prove age of consent with a team of ~24 moderators, so will continue using discretion.

"You're probably hoping that by wearing just a bra, it'll draw our attention away from that God awful handwriting. Were you having a stroke when you wrote that sign? Those lips don't give any clue in the matter, but I guess that's the downside of getting botox; no one will be able to tell if you've had a stroke or not. The upside is they're probably great for sucking cock, and if that handwriting is any indication or your skillset, sucking cock will be your only source of income."
