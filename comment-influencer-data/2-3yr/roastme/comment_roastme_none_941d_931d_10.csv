In prison, the inmates make these things called ""betties"" they're tube socks with the insides wrapped in plastic, and rubber bands securing the outside, basically a fleshlight or pocket pussy, albeit homemade with limited means available, and some of these guys will get creative with them, I mean really elaborate, rocket scientist-like, outside the box thinking, just so they can get their dicks off.  So if you're feeling flattered by all these guys on tinder trying to get in your smelly love hole, don't be.  You're basically just a sock and bottle of lotion with daddy issues to them."
