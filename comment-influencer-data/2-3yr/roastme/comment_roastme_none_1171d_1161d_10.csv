Are you in some kind of fitness protection program?
You're so desperate for pecs you put birdseed under your tits
You look like you learned arithmetic with the microwave buttons  
Star Wars and a pull up. Fantasy is your bag huh?
Of course the plate is already used.
I said I wanted eggs not eczema
I wasn't feeling too great about myself today until I saw this picture of you.  Appreciate it 
"Late at night, when your dad pushes you boobies together and fucks them, do you feel like he really loves you?"
"25 pizza rolls, about 5 minutes 42 seconds. No need to flip them, too many trips to the microwave.

Edit: Shameless [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acDEq-3O3ZA) of me at age 13 dancing to Barbie Girl. Fat from the start, baby!"
Sometimes [I don't even use a plate.](http://imgur.com/wrKgAL9)
Bro.  Tell me that was original.
You are literally the definition of what everyone thinks Americans look like. 
"Everyone here keeps talking about the fact that you're a fat virgin, which is too easy. The real shame here is your crippling social anxiety and lack of self confidence that made you wait 3 months to post this after your first failed /r/roastme attempt. "
I think she should be called gummy bear instead of mama bear. 
You are over encumbered
"That was... And I don't say this lightly. Worse that a hundred September 11th's. 

Edit: Quote from Bojack Horseman my favorite show and your new favorite show."
"You look like the kind of person that refers to her tits as ""the girls"". "
"Being that size, I would say you've got one foot already in the grave. But it was probably amputated years ago from the diabetes. "
"If you are going to serve food to the public, be a gentlemen and wear long sleeves. You look like you caught something that is not washing off."
"A lot of the comments are insinuating that you're gay, but I doubt it. That would be far too unusual. You're about as interesting as a toast sandwich. I don't think you've ever had an original thought. You've done average-to-good in school and you'll continue to do average-to-good in life. You'll settle down in your early 30s when you stumble across another equally vapid female who's begun to get those desperate thoughts that she might never marry or have children. You look as if someone took a boring as fuck, personality-devoid, mindless cretin, covered them in glue and threw them into Urban Outfitters in the vain hope it would make them look the slightest bit intriguing. It hasn't worked. You probably won't endure that much hardship in life but you'll go to the grave knowing that no one was ever truly *interested* in you and that, in the grand scheme of things, you have made no impact on anything whatsoever. "
"Hey, Stoop Kid left his stoop"
Hopefully a future boss sees this
Motherfucker looks like a Zika baby mixed with a troll doll. 
Someone deleted the comment about mold under my tits. Just to clear things up here is [proof I don't!](http://imgur.com/ZPwJFMO)
"I'm married and I like to show off my body, if that makes you feel any better.

Edit: being funny helps too."
Please do us a favour and grow the monobrow so those two caterpillars can mate already.
I hate how girls always go to the top of /r/RoastMe and guys never get upvoted.
"Selfie focusing on just the face and tits? Classic fat girl maneuver. I'm on to you, Thicky Minaj."
"Part of the Guy Fieri outreach program, I see."
"It's spelled ""dessert"", you don't have to eat part of the word, too."
That was original
You look like a life size candle of Amy Schumer that's been burning for 5 hours. 
More like Helga after transitioning.
Comfortably Dumb
Heyyyy you guys!!!
...How do you look both 16 and 40 years old at the same time?
You're going to make some black guy very happy a few times...
those tits almost deserve a censorship 
"I'm guessing you actually use the ""other"" box "
"Micropeen and living check to check. She actually makes all the money (not saying I don't pay my share). But enough of this real talk. I think i'm going to stick my dick in some mayo to see what it feels like. In case you were wondering, microwave for about 11 seconds."
"You're the type of girl (I think) where if I sit next to you and fart, and other people notice the smell, I could blame you and people wouldn't question it"
"If I had a face like that, I'd be convinced God doesn't exist too."
It's like the molester and the molestee somehow fused together. 
When you open your mouth does Spongebob exit it?
Your dad regrets everything.
"This is my favorite roast ever and it's because you're stronger than anyone and everyone here. Keep it coming, you beautiful bastard. "
Into a planet
"Dude...this isn't even a roast so much as life advice, but when people say ""you should be proud of your body"" there is definitely a limit on that. Being slightly overweight or a little bit out of shape is one thing, being recklessly obese and proud of it is another. I mean, if you want to eat your way into an early grave, by all means, go right ahead, but doesn't it bother you at all going out in public and knowing that there's not even a chance that any female will find you attractive in any way? Do you not even have the slightest urge to improve your body maybe even just a little bit? I know this all sounds dickish but I'm genuinely curious, I have a little bit of a beer gut and that alone drives me nuts because I feel like I'm letting myself go. Are you just so far gone that you said ""fuck it"" and gave up?"
looks like you've already been roasted.
You're like the IRL disappointing Tinder match for someone that thought they were going to hook up with the Brawny guy.  
You are why I wear condoms.
Your armor was also supposed to protect you from Uncle Jimmy. 
Why? Did you tell him you were pregnant?
"lol the fuck this nigga is straight fat as fuck and probably gonna die early due to his weight. He's strong for what?
"
Wtf clean your tits man
It won't protect you from crippling depression.
"Here we spot a male spotted walrus in its natural habitat, getting ready for another day of disappointment and regret."
Well you're on the right track for the 27 club Amy Winehouse 2.0 
International House of Psoriasis. 
Do the two rings attach to shut you up?
Your eyebrows couldn't be any more fake if they were written by The Onion
TIL Cocaine is terrible for your complexion 
"I'm speechless. 

You literally have no redeeming qualities. "
Which anime character did you make your waifu?
"Dude. You stopped halfway thru your cringe vid to take a piss, and you didn't flush. You then uploaded it to YouTube for the world to see. I have to respect that level of shamelessness"
"Everything about your photo screams ""wacky personality to deflect suppressed trauma and insecurities"". "
His hair is the only thing that's straight. 
I'm dead 
[deleted]
Or maybe the mods looked at your physique and figured you'd be back for seconds 
Nice to see your leprosy colony has a ihop
You seem like one of those chicks that's so insecure you have to reply to every post someone makes about you in a r/RoastMe thread.
Is that a Wu Tang lucky charms marshmallow?
He looks like Miss Piggy's lost brother
"Speaking of illiterate, did you spell roast wrong and have to flip the page?"
You actually do look sort of like the kind of person who's only defining feature is his parents' money. 
You look like a level 4 Oddish.
**DUDE!**
Finally! Ethnically diverse Mr. Potato Heads!
I'm just baffled by all the different ways you've disappointed your parents. 
you okay? this is oddly specific..
"Don't be ashamed of your foot fetish, you just want to know what they feel like"
Ace Ventura 3: Special Olympics
Sidenote: trying to defend yourself on every comment means you're probably not the type of person who really needs a roast.
His legs muscles are probably strong holding that shit up all day. 
Your beard looks like when a fat chick tries to shave her pussy.
You look like something I drew with my left hand.

"Atheist? are you sure, you look more Hindu to me"
I think its called being ugly.
Pimps would not see that as a disqualification.  From there it's only a dash of baking soda to crack.
Did that this semester... but he never called me again...
You look like a default Sims character.

Your dad is going to be pissed when he finds out you've been posting your boy boobs in his man cave...again.

You look like Rosie O'Donnel's ballsack 
"you're basically insulting yourself because you're implying that something so disgusting could come from your testicles. instead, you should say, this is why people doing incest should wear condoms."
"I don't need to try to make you hate your life. You probably are doing a great enough job at that already, seeing as you are the type to brag about your ""drug use"". I bet you don't even do coke. You're just like one of those 10th graders who excessively talk about the massive amounts of pot they've smoked so maybe the Senior girls will let their drip-dick selves tag along to parties. Keep it up, edgelord. Tumblr has a special place just for you."
This is such a strange sentence to read.
If your eyes were any deeper sunk in you'd have tunnel vision. 
"If Joey Fatone, Kevin Owens, and Freddy Krueger somehow had a child with depression."
You look like the antagonist in a Smash Mouth music video
"I'd say ""get used to eating ramen"", but it looks like you already have"
Careful guys. We don't want to wake the dragon.
I think my [other tattoo](http://imgur.com/pDVa79Z) expresses me better. I should get a piece of fried chicken on my 4th chin tho.
You have the body of a 13 year old girl and the face of a man who looks like he enjoys raping 13 year old girls.

You look like a Mormon Christopher Hemsworth lumberjack who moonlights as a gloryhole jockey.  
"After King of The Hill was cancelled, Bobby Hill fell into a deep depression he could never get out of."
It's like your alternate timeline self and your current timeline self got fused together in a way that suggests that you were destined to be the same kind attention whore no matter what choices you made in life.
You look like you just found out that fucking your sister is legal in your state. 
Make America potato again

It looks like your ran out of pubes to super glue to the rest of your cheeks
"That +5 Shirt of Infinite Loneliness isn't fireproof and has 0 armor points, but it does have a 100% chance of being worn by a virgin."
"You're the type of girl to doll up and ask for a roast me for attention, cry in the shower after you got it, and then make a blog about how this was all just a social experiment entitled, ""Chivalry is dead"". It is. But not as dead as your sense of self-worth."
Best one so far .

What's really sad about this is I bet if you had a normal pose and facial expression in the photo you would look worse
The fact that you consider your atheism a defining characteristic is roasting enough.
