And it's supervised.
If we roast him too much all that'll be left is a pair of eyebrows and an art degree from the University of Phoenix.
Your Tinder has seen more lefts than a NASCAR track.
Your watercolours are shitty
He's still alive. Roast him some more boys.

Sorry that model agency form you filled out at the mall never called you. 
I'm much more impressed by the superb bracketing than by the roast itself. Bravo.
