"You're one of those online dating chics that takes the perfect angle photo of themselves, and when the guy pulls up for the date and sees the real you...he just keeps on driving. "
I'm having trouble figuring out if you're just a really effeminate dude or a butt ugly lesbian.
He looks like a black guy who only has white friends.
"Jesus is somebody holding up a ""roast me"" sign at an open casket funeral?"
She looks like she plays a demon hunter in a SyFy original TV series.
the guidelines say minimum posting age is 16
"Keep this photo. In a couple more years, you'll realise just how much you missed looking average."
"If the smell of stale Marlboro Lights ever needed a cover girl, they'd pick you."
Original like how you decided to locate your piercing completely at random? 
"The look on your face says that you think you're good looking, but the rest of your face says you're not."
"I'm not sure what needs updated more, the hair, the clothes, or the kitchen."

"You look more like the actor for the main character of a short Christian film explaining the importance of abstinence before marriage, wherein you and that  one girl you always look at during church coincidentally meet at a party you both shouldn't be at, past your curfew. After a single beer each you drive to a secluded makeout point in the park and almost kiss before you think of the huge mistake you're about to make, and stop her. You both go to confession and it ends with you both having dinner with a chaperone. "
Looks like the type of guy that you'd see in an infomercial that can't do anything right until someone gives him said useful item... and would then fuck it up anyways
Gay Bruce Willis

You'll give him a different face when you catch him fucking your younger, prettier sister at Thanksgiving. Your family will side with your sister."
You look like you could turn water into weed.

Then after the female is satisfied, she will discard her male who will never receive attention again.  The male will then be replaced by another new male friend who will join her legion of male friends.  This will go on for many years, and sometimes decades until the female chooses to settle down with her selected male (usually not chosen from her friends) or until she has stopped receiving attention from all men, usually due to age."
Anyway here's Under Pressure 
Well you sure as fuck didn't eat it.

and trust me, no matter what generation you think you belong in, they wouldn't want you either"
"Ok... Cover up the right half of your face and you're cute AF. Cover up the left half and your google eye creeps me the fuck out.  
Not much of a roast, I realize.  
Basically.. in a nutshell.. your face is weird."
I didn't realize it was still dyed. I thought it was dead from being dyed and bleached so many times.
Holy shit 
Minimalist vegan with a ton of shit half of which has animal products. I sure hope you fail less in at least some aspect of your identity.
"I'm sure you'd like me to write ""You're too pretty to roast"" or to bask at your perfection but just like your dad I'm gonna take a look at you and just leave."

"You're going to spend the next 15 years wondering why the hot guys don't pay any attention to you because you think you're a 10 while your wonky face knocks you down to a 6, but you can't see it.  By that time you'll be giving blowjobs to any guy who buys you a drink because it's the only way a man will waste more than 10 minutes on you.  The loneliness will get worse and worse until you marry some slob who will slap you around whenever his boss yelled at him at work but you'll convince yourself that it's ok because you're going to change him.  He's not changing."
You look like the rejected personality from inside out

That model from a few months ago that had to delete all of her social media
"I wonder if this guy is anything other than buzzwords and consumer trends? Seriously, look. When these trends go out of style, he'll have literally nothing left. His entire identity is an ad agencies wet dream. He's a vegan until the cute girl at the bar says she likes steak. He's a minimalist until he can afford to buy more trendy shit. This guy doesn't ride the bandwagon he *is* the bandwagon. "
Don't forget her interracial relationship.
