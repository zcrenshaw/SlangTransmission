Everyplace I've eaten in NYC has a strict pants-or-skirts-required policy.
"this didn't happen to me but i was about 3 feet away.

there was a guy who, out of the blue, told us all on the platform to cherish our parents and our mothers because he had just lost his an hour before. he was kinda hovering near the edge of the platform...and some freaking amazing angel woman, put her hand on his shoulder and asked him to come away from the edge of the platform. she then spent the next 15 minutes, while we were waiting on the train, looking at pictures of his family on his phone...by the end of it, the kid was laughing and crying and apparently feeling a little better. once the train got there she went in a different direction, which makes me think she was an angel. 

it was really quite beautiful to see.

i have lots of friends who think New Yorkers are gruff assholes who yell all the time. i have been here just a few months, and yes they honk their horns way too much, but over all, they are there when you need them."
On that one weekend you're out of town.
The New York Public Library is only a short walk from Times Square on 5th and 42nd street. 
"You did it just like we do: leave the house without always checking if the trains are running normally and wind up somewhere between pissed off and pleasantly surprised that there are always new spots to stumble into.

Next time you might get to wake up in Coney Island from a short black out only knowing how bad you gotta pee. Next time!"
I once explained to a couple of very drunk german girls that some Americans actually do speak multiple languages and that they should probably keep it down with trying to guess at which guy on the train was the best lay. I might have also sarcastically added that it was probably me right before departing the train. 
"It happens when you get in a morning routine :)

Last year, it was a similar situation, freezing one day and high 60s the following. My wife walked out in a floor-length, zipped up down jacket. She was running late and could not go back up to change though, so she was ""that person"" that day. Felt like a tool, but you learn."
Subway. 
"Oh shit I saw something and didn't say anything! 

Gregg T. would be so ashamed."
Yes. 6 million people a day
"I have a subway game where I count the number of Canada Goose in my car (within eyesight). If the number is higher than the previous day, I win and buy myself a bagel from the food cart near work.

Fun game, gained some weight."
Same answer applies
Not your plate number? Not you.
Greenwich. 
"Probably didn't listen to the weather in the morning?

I've had days where I left the house realized it was nice and just had to do the ""This is my life now."" ~~Because I am lazy.~~"

"If a lot of people are bumping into you, it's probably your fault. 

If a stranger ""tells you off,"" you were probably inconveniencing a lot of people without realizing it. 

People not from here aren't used to being spatially aware in crowded areas and don't realize just how obstructionist they can be. "
"* Don't get on line if you don't know what you're going to order
* Don't make random chit chat with cashiers unless the store is dead empty
* The speed at which people walk, take stairs, and talk
* Personal space only exists behind your sunglasses
* No one wants to hear your life story when you need help; ""excuse me, I'm visiting from Nebraska and I'm trying to meet a friend for lunch and I need to figure out which way to 36th street"" is bad; ""36th street?"" with a finger point is good."
"Please don't come here, you sound awful."
You'd have way too much time on your hands.
Most people take the day of delivery off of work. 
"Well, I was going to offer some suggestions but you sound like a complete dick. So go fuck yourself instead."
"OP, you've solved the crime wave gripping the city, where many, many babies and toddlers have been kidnapped by persons unknown.  ALL THE KIDS ARE IN CENTRAL PARK BEING PUSHED AROUND IN STROLLERS BY RANDOM WOMEN!!!!  Did you tell the police?

(Yes, they are nannies)"
"There's that panic of ""OH GOD I AM IN HARLEM I AM GOING TO DIE!!!"" 

Yeah, you're surrounded by black people. You're also surrounded by academies, boutiques, banks, theaters, museums, parks, and restaurants in one of the most culturally rich neighborhoods in the United States, with a crime rate lower than midtown (the tourism Mecca). "

"There really aren't any disco clubs... you have to follow the DJ's. Here's a few examples:  

- The most disco imo is Horse Meat Disco, but it's a gay night. They come to Output in Brooklyn every 4-6 weeks. 

- For a look at some classic soul/disco/funk Paradise Garage era stuff check out any nights that [Danny Krivit's](http://dannykrivit.net/) hosts. 

- There's also The Loft parties, but those are word of mouth, and you need to be invited by a 'member' and each member can only bring one person- I know people who go, and they're supposed to be good (only vinyl). 

- Goldroom does a decent job, but it's so fucking house. He's also not around very often. I'd say Moon Boots also falls into this camp, but honestly, you're gonna get like three disco jams. These were my early days, and I'm over them.
  
- Mr Sunday is supposed to be kind of disco, but not Saturday Night Fever chafeel. 

- So far as clubs go, Jupiter Disco just opened off of Jefferson in Bushwick, and that's supposed to be good, but unconfirmed. 

- Another club is Black Flamingo. They're always booking Eli Escobar and the other deep house // nudisco // disco // house heads through, and they're all great, but not super real Saturday Night Fever. 

- Always check out resident advisor."
"One of my hacks is just to have two (or more) or everything. Keep one at work, one at home, stash some with friends. Works well with shoes, umbrellas, headphones, phone chargers, medications, whatever.

Screw carrying stuff backwards and forwards between work and home for a joke."
"Do you remember when you were in school and you had to do these stupid word problems where Suzy had x dollars and needed a percentage to get to y and you said to yourself, ""Fuck this, I will never, ever need to know this in my life!""

Well..."
"If you take the number of days it was acceptable to wear a polar-rated parka and divide it by the cost, it was an exceptionally bad investment... hence why the guy was wearing it. Also, people are ridiculous and style on the calendar day, and not the weather. "
Not dumb at all: http://www.bike.nyc/education/classes/learn-to-ride-adults/
if it's less than 10 blocks just walk. Busses are good for going cross town but not really during rush hour. Use www.mta.info to check if a bus is going to arrive soon.   
In NYC? They'd think you were nuts and walk WAY around to avoid you. People in NYC are usually surprised and leery if you smile at them too widely and unexpectedly. Waving that's something they only expect to see you do if you know them or because you're part of a parade.  ;)   
No. 1 rule of the city. Worry about yourself.
"&gt;cheapest/most gentrified places

I am not sure you know how gentrification works.

What you will need to make depends on what the rent is. Go to streeteasy, look up apartments of that size. Times that by 40. That's how much."
"- There's a group of drag queens (and kings!) that may be of interest. They are more about the actual drag performances and campiness, but you'd be welcome to any of their events http://www.switchnplay.com/

- I can vouch for Ginger's Bar in Park Slope, Brooklyn. It's a lesbian bar but you'd be totally find there if you wanted to dress up and have a few drinks or hang out or something.

I'm a transgender woman who has gone through the full process of transition, as in I have medically, legally, socially transitioned. I'm not a male-identified person who crossdresses sometimes, which is what I believe you are communicating about yourself in this post. Correct me if I am wrong. I started going out en femme when I did not quite pass yet (about 6 months into medically transitioning) and I found that plenty of people at bars in Brooklyn will not even bat an eye or care. I stayed in Prospect Heights, Park Slope, Downtown Brooklyn, Boerum Hill area where it tends to be relatively safe.

Pro-tip - bring cash when you go out. Using a credit card with a male name on it when you're dressed en femme can cause problems.

Feel free to PM me if you'd like to discuss further. :)"
"If it shows up online, then you will have to appeal it online. It takes them a little while to show up in the system. But the fact that the license number is wrong is immediate grounds for dismissal. "
Diversity. Apparently..
"NYC ID is not a valid proof of age, so if the issue is that bars are not accepting the out of state ID then this is not a solution."
"Guy's American Kitchen and Bar

Owned by the dude who hosts Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives so should be similar to what you're looking for"
"Never make eye contact with someone shouting and or gesticulating wildly on the subway. You're locked in that motherfucker for a minimum of 4 minutes, a lot of shit can happen in that time."
