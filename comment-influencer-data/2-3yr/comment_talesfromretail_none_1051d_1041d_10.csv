time to sue
"If I thought it about the time, then sure.  But it has been several years ago.  Not worth it now."
Who the **** writes their PIN on the freaking card? Is she that stupid?
Time to find out where his son works and give him the grief of his life. 
"""A lady then approached me and asked where the grapes were. One thing led to another, and now I work at a grocery store."""
"A crackhead tried to rob me once when I worked overnight at a gas station in the hood. I'll admit at first I didn't quite grasp what he was trying when he kept saying, ""I'm all about dat money yo."" Instead I decided to have fun with a crackhead and ended up going back and forth with him saying,""Hey! Me too! That's what they pay me for, to keep track of the money!"" This went on for some time, back and forth until he finally said something like, ""Oh forget it man, I give up."" That is when it clicked for me. He left, so I went out and got my pistol from my car. On the way back in, he came riding up on a girls kid bike, pink streamers and all and I think he noticed the bulge on the small of my back. He came back in and was asking if I called ""dem boyz"" and I still acted oblivious questioning him why I would call anyone, etc... Eventually, I told him it was obvious that he was coming down and offered to chill out with him and talk/keep him company until he was ok again. We sat outside smoking cigarettes for the next hour or two until he got up, thanked me, shook my hand and rode off into the night on that little girls bicycle. Dude was a beast too. Muscle bound guy (must have been fairly new to crack I guess) in a wife beater, pretty intimidating looking.

My favorite line from the night was him asking me why I wasn't scared because he could have killed me if he had a gun. I told him I wasn't worried about him having a gun and knew he didn't. He asked me how I knew and I simply said, ""If you had a gun, you would have already traded it for more crack."""
You're lucky that's the *only* hair he tried to show you.
"That is pathetic! And if you had backed down with every customer who said that, then you would be fired for not following company policy. "
"He probably doesn't.

I'm being petty."
I love that you both played the ignorance game and you won. 
"Years ago, before I became the jaded and salty retail veteran I am now (I was also on commission then), I would wait for folks. 

I got screwed over one too many times and will not at all now, even if we could in big retail. 5 minutes away means 15, 10 minutes means 30, and ""one tiny thing to do"" means ""I'm going to need an hour at least"".

Nope. No more. If you can't get your happy ass in here during the hours we are open, you can figure something else out.
"
I'd like to think that her hubby gave her the money to go pick out a pair of boots then wrote the note. Keeps me from feeling bad for her.
"Apparently, yes."
"WHEN I REMOVED MY CARD A RECEIPT CAME OUT, DOES THAT MEAN MY MONIES ARE GONE??"
"Very well written, also, hysterical. Where do these people come from??"
"Mushrooms, Marshmallows, Mashed potatoes, Mastoid processes.... whatever."
"&gt; ""Do you mind stamping me again?""

Okay, here ya go.

&gt; ""This girl tattooed me against my will!!""

?????????"
Someone asked me once what's the difference between a 4 piece and a 6 piece. I said 2 and they got mad as if i was rude 
"It's totally worth it imo dude, they fired you for doing exactly what they told you to do, so they literally fired you for no reason.  They could have made you apologize, but no.  Plus I'm pretty sure you get money out of it, right?"
Seriously though he probably doesn't.
"No words can describe how angry I am.
If this were to happen to me, I would gone over my managers head and contacted the district HR manager or employee complaint line, and got him fired.

Edit: at the most, when ever the policy was different then written for the store I was at, the manager would simply tell me do this action from now on.

Not fire me!
This is the kind of store I'd love to see on the news.
"
"I almost got robbed at a gas station too, but like you, didn't realize what was happening. It was a kid I went to school with, been out for a while though. 

He came up to me asking if I had change for a $20. I pulled out my wallet, and he told me ""just to give him what I had"". I was like ""man, are you sure? I only have like 5 ones? That's not really enough for your $20. Maybe we can go break it inside the store?"" He persisted, and told me ""no, just give me what you have, ok?!?"" And then I mentioned ""oh, hey, you went to ----- high school right? I think I had you in ----- class, hey man, sorry I couldn't be more help, like I said I only have a couple of ones.""

He just said ""oh fuck, forget it....."" And walked off. Whoops??? "
I hate when the bags get left it's gets blamed on the cashier.  Like especially if the bags are on their side. Like bitch you got hands you can grab.  
"'that way when he freaks out, at least there's steak.'

Love how she thinks!"
"Oh, I know what happened next: the kid then drank a lot, climbed into a car and proceeded to kill four people on the highway, only to be sentenced to probation."
"&gt; Me: Huh, really? Did it sound like this? (slams phone onto receiver)

You are my hero"
"DON'T YOU DARE LET THIS GO! Get ahold of HR, contact a lawyer and get this ball rolling. I'm so angry for you. "
"""a few years ago i""

he already let it go"
"It's worse than firing OP for no reason. Employers are ALLOWED to fire without reason.  They fired with a reason that runs contrary to industry practices.
That'd be like getting fired for going to work, and having the reason be ""He came to work on time."""
Do these look like 17 year old pubes to you!?
"Exactly. When we were leaving work yesterday at 6pm we had a guy speed up and ask if we were still open. We were stood outside waiting for the shutters to close and the alarm to set. He then demanded we reopen. Thing is, we closed at 4, and were supposed to have left at 5. "
Hopefully the ~~cops~~ courts take his license
"""You confessed that you were buying alcohol for our underage son, and the stupid cashier didn't want to sell it to you. I know, I'll go confess to committing the same crime, and then he'll sell it! That'll work! I'll be right back, wait here."""
"On the rare occasions that I'm able to witness the action as it happens, I chase them down with the item and (in my best retail voice) ""return""  it to them as if they forgot it.  ""I think you sat this down while you were looking at another item.  Wouldn't want to get all the way home and realize you left your bologna on that cereal shelf!""  I have some other great passive-aggressive responses to customers for various situations. "
Time for grandpa to stop driving
"&gt;""Just gotta check the clips aren't broken, we've had a few returned because of it in the last few weeks.""

I would usually use either ""Let me get this paper out of here"" or ""Just need to check for any surprises"" We did actually have a customer find an empty candy wrapper inside a bag that had then stained the bag with chocolate, so not a complete lie but a great way to check without accusing. Checking the zippers is a good one too."
"A coworker of mine once told me about how at her previous job a customer was angry about something so they went to the front desk to complain. When the person at the desk didn't give them the answer they wanted they demanded the manager. So the person turned their back to them and turned back around and said ""Hi, how can I help you?"" 

The customer got even more angry and demanded to speak to the owner. So he did the same thing again, because he was the owner, and the guy just stormed out. "
"You don't have to prove that they are drunk, you just need reasonable suspicion. If you think that they might be drunk, you are well within your rights to deny them service.

Where I work, we are required to ask for ID from everyone. I have had people come in thinking that their jail phone card counted as ID because it has a face and a name on it. I usually laugh in their face. "
"I really want one day for some ass to ask for a manager while I'm managing so I cam say 

""Sure!"" Go to the back and come back out saying ""How can I help you?"""
"Eastern European here: such is life. I steer clear of interaction with that class.  
I can only imagine how bad it is in western countries where rich people are like kings and queen."
"The deli manager likes to duck behind the counter, turn his hat backwards, and then pop back up with an accent "
"We've got a saying in the uk which is 'fur coat and no knickers' basically money can't buy class 

I live in a town which has oil money and people have no idea how to interact. They think the ruder they are the better their level is in life. "
"Stayed open late once on Christmas Eve! This guy spent about $250 buying things for his girlfriend, but he took maybe two hours. He had to look at everything. Okay great, we wanted the money. It's my friend's shop and I worked there. We would have closed at 5 but he didn't get out of there until after 7. Fine, like I said we wanted the money.  
Shop was only open weekends. Next weekend here he comes, wants his money back, she didn't like the things he picked out. Awesome. Well I hadn't had enough cash sales to refund his money so I gave him some cash and he chose some other items and we worked out a store credit. He tells me that he is a good customer. I guess I wasn't acting happy about all of this. I explained that it's not really doing us any good when you make us stay open for two hours and then want your money back, and he seemed sort of surprised like that hadn't occurred to him. Bring your girlfriend so you know what she wants. Shop when the store is open. That is a good customer. And I had to deal with her because he came back several times getting his credit. She didn't like anything. And they would try to talk the price down which was not happening because we had already allowed him to talk the price down on the original purchase.   
This was a small antique store so it's different than normal retail, but he really killed staying open late for me. "
And that's how I met your mother.
"Absolutely not true. ""At will employment"" means that there is no LEGAL bar to firing someone, as in, nothing statutory. But if you have a contract, or are otherwise led to believe that your job is secure to an extent, then you have a contractual remedy.

Example: Joe gets fired because he's black. The law says that's not allowed, and the employer gets into legal trouble for violating the law, extra fines on top of contractual damages.

Example 2: Joe gets fired because he wore a black shirt. Company handbook insists that employees wear black shirts. Joe (in most states) can sue for wrongful termination and recover contractual damages.

In other words, you were complying with company policy. I assume there's an employee handbook that has that in it. In most states, employees handbook is construed to be a contract between employees and employers. As an attorney: talk to an attorney."
"Unfortunately, my wife has an auto immune disease where she gets word substitution issues.  They're temporary.

It's really remarkable.  She will periodically swap two words in her vocabulary in both speaking and understanding.  She might say ""Hand me the piano"" and if I ask (based on context) ""do you mean salt?"" she might reply ""why do I need to put a musical instrument on my french fries?""  She has swapped piano and salt in her head.  This only happens for a few minutes.  Consequentially, her career as a nurse is over.

"
"I love the jump that blacklight-flourescent somehow means it's tattooed, not stamped?"
Why would I want my username to be seven asterisks?
"If you know that he uses your companies bags for his own companies use you need to inform your manager that is his intention. Then the manager needs to go up the chain to decide what best to do. 

Likely, the manager will confront the customer, the customer will complain and be redirected to corporate and you'll likely lose him as a customer so it's win-win "
"I had two gentlemen with a 5 year old attempt this at a hardware store.  I was manning self checkout and they came up and scanned a tag.  It was for 13-something dollars but they didn't take the tool bag out of the cart.  Of course I was having a bad day anyway, so I walk up and say, quickly, I have to check the bag and then promptly dump it in their cart.  They tried to say no, but the deed was already done.  I looked them dead in the eye and asked if they wanted to pay for those as well.  They said they didn't know all those tools were in there.  Yea...because a canvas tool bag usually weights 30 pounds.  So I gather up the tools and then glance at the barcode they scanned against what was on the bag.  Of course it didn't match.  They had already paid, so I, again, looked at them, ""You have two options, you can go to returns and return whatever it is you scanned and leave, or you can purchase the bag correctly.""  They nodded and slowly went down that way.  I informed the cashier and they returned the tag they rang up and left.  I hate people sometimes.  Especially to do something like that in front of a child."
"The cashier doesn't have a choice.

I dream of the day when I retire and open some small mom-and-pop shop to pass the days. I'll have the freedom to tell customers off. "
"I think drivers should be re-tested every few years, regardless of age."
"*shines beam at customer*

*buzzer goes off and screen flashes BAD EGG*"
"And just like a typical toddler, she learned that crying and screaming gets her what she wants."
"Should have clarified, Her post underneath the pic said ""got home from a long day with the kids to find this surprise"" 
He may have gotten her the flowers but definitely not the boots, and I think the note is just for attention. I didn't mean to rip on her really, because I do honestly like her. I'm just always so cynical with posts like that in general so it was funny to see one where I actually knew it wasn't real. "
"&gt; I pull parts and fully assemble two different 460 distributors and bring them to the counter and verify which one looks like his. After disassembling it we find out that he needs the rotor. 

Not bad for

&gt;idiots like you that don't know the difference between their ass and a hole in the ground."
"I didn't last long. We discovered that while I'm wonderful at sales and upselling, normally in the top 3, I have little tolerance for stupidity. So while normally I performed wonderfully, I would snap back at the rude or stupid customer. A few too many complaints and I decided retail was not for me. "
"My friend had a similar story. He worked at a pharmacy and this one crazy lady flipped out on him when he was scanning her items with the laser because he was ""awfully close"" at hitting her with the beam and ""giving her cancer."""
GIVE ME THE MONI**E**S BACK BUT I'LL KEEP THE FOODS THANK YOU
"He didn't- it was an excuse for me to take out my wallet. Then when I didn't have any money he insisted he'd ""just take what I had"" with no intention of giving me his $20 lol. I was also innocent AF and didn't understand the intention until way too late into the encounter. "
wrongful termination
"Yup.

We're only married 8 years.  It's my first marriage.

The disease appears in flare ups, then backs off.  

This means we cannot plan anything since we don't know when she'll be sick.  We sometimes plan with close friends, but they know we may have to cancel at any time.  When she has flare ups, we're essentially stuck at home.  Or, she is- I can go out, but I mean where we make plans as a couple.

When she has these, she may sleep 16 hours a day.  Sometimes more.  I have to do most household chores.  She can generally care for herself but sometimes has severe dizziness and I will have to help her get to the bathroom then.  

We have very high health care bills.  Over 12K last year in our of pocket that we paid out.  She has a 4 page ""medical resume"" with drugs, physicians, diagnoses, and so on.  We have significant unpaid medical bills.  We've consulted with a bankruptcy attorney who says ""until she's cured, there's no point in doing anything.""  Since there is no cure, well....

When she has a flare, she cannot drive so any physician visit I have to take off work.  

I have about 25 years in computer support in hospitals.  I was working sysadmin work- taking care of large, behind the scenes computers that run things.  But, since I can no longer be on call 24/7, I am working our help desk.  My boss loves having me since I'm likely one of the more knowledgeable people on his staff, but he has to live with the sudden ""Boss, I need to leave work now- talk to you later"" issues.  I'm lucky that he's very compassionate and understanding about that so I have no issues where I work.

It's hard remembering it's the disease and not a choice my wife makes on some of this stuff.  When she's tired and I want to do something, I have to remember she's the victim and I'm just a bystander.  The aggravation I experience is nothing compared to living with the issue in your own body.

I've seen a counselor about my issues regarding this and it's tough hearing ""acceptance of end of life processes.""  She's too young to think about that, but that's where it is for someone with a disability that has no cure.

I sometimes get a lot of rage.  I have no one really to be mad at.  That's a weird feeling.  I don't believe in God, and now sometimes I wish I did since I could blame him.  It's not that satisfying being mad at DNA- this disease appears to be DNA based.

A lot of husbands leave their wives due to this disease.  I will not.  I waited a long time to find the right woman, and I love her dearly.  I take seriously the ""in sickness and in health"" promise in the wedding vows.  So, we keep on."
"In that situation I feel like ""off the clock = not my problem"" is quite applicable. Funny story :D"
"Maybe they meant price? Possibly asking if it was a different style of chicken or maybe came with more sides? 

Haha, who the fuck am I kidding? They just had an embarrassing brain fart and tried to blame it on you, the minimum wage fast food drone. "
"""You followed the rules, you're a loose canon."""
Hank Hill would like a word with him.
"Hahaha people do that at my store a lot.

Customer: ""When is your next sale?"" 
Me: ""Not sure, the owner doesn't give us more than a 24hr notice for sales.""
Customer: ""I'm just going to hide this shirt in the clearance rack!""
Me: ""We straighten literally every rack in the store multiple times a day, there isn't a point.""

Or they don't want you to find out they went over the fitting room limit so they rush out and throw their things on the nearest shelf and book it. "
That's like making your username Hunter2.
You foiled her attempt to complain.
Sounds like you just learned a new joke you were anxious to use.
"Sounds like onset Alzheimer's. When I was 17 I used to work at a clothing retailer at the mall. As I was hanging jackets up on the racks in front of the store this confused old guy comes in, takes one off the hanger, puts it on right in front of me, and just walks out into the mall.

I chase him down and go ""sir, you have to pay for that jacket if you want it!"" And he just goes ""what?! This is my jacket!"" I show him the price tag that's still attached to it and he gets super embarrassed, hands it back, apologizes, and walks away."
"""One thing led to another."" That's just lazy writing. That's like saying ""Hitler got kicked out of art school. One thing led to another... And the US dropped two atomic bombs on the sovereign nation of Japan."""
"""I need your keys and your badge""  
Did he actually say it like that cause he made it sound like he's firing you from his police force."
"Visit his store, ask for extra bags..."
Seriously? How do these people not know the rules? If someone forgot their ID they stay in the car or around the corner.
But you have the foods now!
"I like to smile sweetly and tell them ""once we get use to it they will just change it again.""

They always agree, most laugh at it as well. "
"Ugh I hate this. I used to work for a lingerie store and women would return dirty deodorant stained bras that smelled like sweat and were years old, or panties that were dirty. What kind of disgusting person does this?"
"Upvote for ""Chihuahua the Hut""!!"
Well this was before she knew I was stamping her with TERRIFYING CANCER CAUSING NEON  
Every year is a bit much IMO and would be more practical to require it with the renewal of your license.
"""Oh that's perfectly normal, lets just scale over this car wreck and do some banking.""

Customer logic in a nutshell really."
Probably spelled that way because that's how the customer said it.
