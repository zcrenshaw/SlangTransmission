"I'm going to be opinionated and say, at the end of the day, you're probably going to have to have an abortion for your health. There is only one life ever, you want to be able to not be in crippling pain for the rest of it. Your lifelong health should be the utmost priority to you, and to that of your partner, for that matter.

I would suggest:

- Provide him with information (and possibly personal accounts) of difficult pregnancies, make sure he understands fully the lifelong ramifications it can have for you, and how excruciating pregnancy can be *even when you are perfectly healthy*. Make sure that he completely understands what ""pain"" is -- sometimes people look at pregnancy through rose-colored glasses (especially men), oh it's not *that* bad... he needs to understand that the process will most likely be extremely physically traumatic and daunting if you go through with it. He needs to tell you why he considers your longterm, very extreme, pain an option. He needs to realize how complicit he will be in encouraging you to endure and suffer that pain. There is no downplaying allowed here. You know that pain will be god-awful. It would be the hardest thing you have ever done, maybe close to impossible to endure. If he is asking you to continue with the pregnancy without grave regard for that, he is being cruel to you as a human being, and treating you more like an incubator than a partner.

- Make sure he understands what will happen with the surgery and how long of a recovery/what type of recovery it will be. Someone here posted that they couldn't lift anything baby-sized for a year after their surgery. They had to be helped 24/7 because they couldn't move on their own.

- If you go through with this, he will be the primary caregiver to both of you. If necessary (if he doesn't do chores much) write down a list of objectives that he'll need to constantly handle on a day by day basis. Absolutely everything. Laundry, bathing, helping you move while also watching the baby, being the only one able to get up in the night to sooth the baby, bringing the baby to feed or getting bottles, making all of the food, making sure you're comfortable and not without something necessary that you can't get up to get (like water/the bathroom).

- He needs to be made aware very explicitly of the risks if you continue the pregnancy instead of getting back surgery. Explain everything. Provide every piece of material you can. If this will potentially cripple you for life, you need to ask him why he places the quality of the rest of your life so low on his list of priorities.

I think you should gather your arguments and thoughts, and write them down. Print that out, and print resources out. Personal accounts are okay, but don't make it completely that. He needs to understand the ramifications that you will face regardless of your decision.

If you are going to write your thoughts down, it would be good to include something about abortion also being a difficult choice for you, and not something you would ever want. Don't be scared to tell him how his desire for a child outweighs his consideration of your pain, either.

If any of his replies imply that he is trying to brush off the physical trauma that you would/have/will endure, you can't let him get away with that. Use analogies that he can understand if he's shit at empathizing (it's like having a weight on you all the time, it's like having the flu for months and never being able to breathe, it's like a tennis ball through your urethra), seriously, if he wants you to endure this so that he can have a child, he needs to be more sympathetic. His expectations need to be grounded in reality. He needs to be there to emotionally support you through the physical trauma.

Make sure you hit home on every point. Provide him with your thoughts and resources about the surgery, affects of pregnancy, potential complications, even the amount of care he will be expected to require, not because you don't want to help him, but because you physically won't be able to.

And then listen to what he has to say. Hopefully, you can come to an understanding. If he downplays your situation, the importance of your health, your happiness and sanity, or the amount of things you won't be able to do regardless of the situation... you need to think long and hard about whether you would *want* to stay with someone who treat you this way in the first place."
"Definitely read more books by authors of color, it's pretty eye-opening to realize the differences between the ways different communities are treated. I'd recommend *The Color of Water* and *Seedfolk* (short YA novel, very easy to read). Also, Desus &amp; Mero is a pretty hilarious tv show hosted by two black dudes who talk about current events and joke about racism in a pretty enlightening way."
"I'm probably going to get downvoted to hell for this but honestly I think you should just suck it up. The complaints you're having are pretty minor compared to how much of the work force deals with. At best you guys move center, his commute gains more length than yours loses. Now you both have long commutes, your boyfriend lives in a neighborhood he doesn't enjoy and has to put additional miles on a new car, which if he leases means he could be forced to pay additional money on miles he wasn't prepared to be putting on his vehicle. You're not going to get a 5 minute commute no matter what, why take it away from him? "
Holy shit this is genius. 
"I don't see anything even remotely narcissistic about Mom's reactions. She's sympathizing with OP (the opposite of narcissism) and upset that OP's having health problems (again, the opposite of narcissism).

If anything, OP comes off as self-absorbed and narcissistic. "
"Yes, honestly, if he's reached adulthood and maintained this level of stubbornness on this issue, you're probably not going to change him. 

I know someone who wears a ratty bathrobe- over his clothes- most of the time. He's... way far out there on the ""not at all"" end of the ""how much do I care about what people think of me"" spectrum, which is cool for him I guess. He's a nice person, but this devotion to wearing what he finds comfortable instead of what 99% of people would consider appropriate outdoor/public attire has had real consequences for his life, including precluding working anywhere where they're not cool with a guy wearing a ratty bathrobe in the workplace (which is most places).

You have to decide whether or not this guy is worth constricting your life in all the ways he chooses to constrict his- like not being comfortable at semi-dressy events, knowing that he may blow things like job interviews because he won't change his clothing, and not being able to go outside in inclement weather because he won't buy new shoes or a jacket."
"He needs to apologize to you, not blame you for overreacting. I have been in this relationship and it is toxic, I would get out if I were you."
I've had a lot of bad days. I've never deliberately destroyed someone else's property and then told them to get over it because I'll buy them another one.
"You're basically 40 years old and are about to marry a gal who is about half your age; young enough to be your daughter.  And, your biggest concern is that her last boyfriend had a bigger dick than you?

Just stop it, man.  You're completely ignoring the things you actually should be worried about, and you're focusing on something that shouldn't make any difference to you at all.  If she orgasms during sex with you, whatever you've got is getting the job done.

If I were you, my top two priorities right now in life would be:

1. Figure out what it is she likes about you, and focus on developing that more.  When a kid that age is with a middle aged man your age, my first assumption would be economic security.  In other words, she's probably more worried about your career prospects than she is about your junk.  So focus on your career.

2. If the two of you are planning on getting married and having kids, that means you're going to be chasing small children around well into your 40s and 50s.  If you're not fit already, go out and join a gym.  Get into cardio shape, lift weights, and eat healthy.  You're going to need alot of energy if you expect to somehow keep up.  If you can keep your body healthy and stay in pretty good shape, you'll accomplish two things; you'll be able to fulfill your role as a dad better, and you'll also probably worry less about not meeting her expectations physically.  Do alot of pushups and situps, see if you can get your mid section super lean and chiseled, etc."
Their quick dating to now engagement phase is irrelevant here. OP needs to cut ties with his friend. Decent human beings don't sexually assault other people. Much less ones they know are engaged to a longtime friend. 
"And the names of his friends who saw you together.  They may lie for him, but thry probably won't lie *well.*"
He only gets about 10 FB messages a year. It's never been worth the bother. I'm also not very tech savvy. I garden. Haha.
"Encourage him to seek out other people in recovery. You can't be his sole support thru this. There are apps, websites, AA meetings, and recovery centers. He should be going to recovery groups to meet and learn from others who have made it out of active adddiction and committed to their recovery. Other activities like meditation, yoga, massage, and exercise can help too. "
"Wow, it's impressive that you managed to get your CPA and come up with this list of excuses for your personal failings.

Why are you even bothering when you're happy to sleep around and deceive your wife?  You say you're too empathetic, but that implies you have respect for the person.  You come off as too cowardly to pull the trigger. "
"I'd listen to what she has to say for your own sanity, closure and whatnot. It's completely on your own terms. I just know I'd be dying to know what happened for the rest of my life if I didn't answer."
"&gt; Overall, I think you need closure. I think you need to need to know what exactly happened and I think you need to decide how to proceed. I think it will be the best way for you to finally pick up the pieces and move on completely. 

This was exactly what I was speaking out against when I said not to get his hopes up.  External closure like you mention here is a myth, for the most part.  If OP goes into this with the expectation that everything will make sense once she explains, and then she says she met someone else and thats why she left, but now wants OP back, that will not be the best way for him to ""pick up the pieces"" and move on.

OP cannot go into this with the expectation of closure.  ""Closure"" comes from within by moving on, whether that is with her or not."
"He's already offered dinner out. She didn't just pop up and go ""It's my birthday, you're buying me a steak!"""
"Yep. Can't help people who don't really want help. She just wanted us to tell her ""nah that's a little odd but he sounds PERFECT otherwise"" 😕"
That and feed his belly.
"&gt; My girlfriend is constantly depressed.  
  
Is she getting therapy? Grief counseling doesn't only happen after someone has died. Is sounds like she needs therapy in general too. You shouldn't try to fix her problems for her, she likely just wants you to commiserate with her. Beware of compassion fatigue as well. Which just reinforces that she needs professional help."
"Repeating here because I really want OP to consider this.

Protect your dogs.  Your (ex we hope) girlfriend might consider doing something to remove the obstacle to her being able to control you and to be the only thing in your life.  

Abuse, ""accidentally"" letting your pets out to get ""lost"" or even poison.  Be extra careful OP and protect your  dogs!!!!!"
Talk to someone at school about it. A counselor or someone. Make sure someone knows in case she decides to press charges or something.
"Smells like bromance to me, too.

*""Why you gotta make me look bad in front of the guys?""*"
"Yes, normal anger is to huff, puff, maybe yell. Normal angry behavior is not to commit bodily harm or assault other people to the point where she could be arrested for her behavior. She is doing this because she doesn't respect you, knows you will stay, and that is why she continues. She doesn't see anything wrong with it nor does she want to change. "
"Oh, dear god, no!

It's gender essentialism, all the way down!"
"They dated for a year, then broke up (due to him moving away) about a month before we started dating.

I do not know him personally, but would NOT have been ok with them meeting up, especially in the environment they did. He was apparently only in town for a couple days for this event, but she never asked me about it, despite us talking earlier that day. I certainly have had zero contact with my previous girlfriend (whom I dated for several years before this), out of respect for my relationship. 


I also don't understand this couch in a room at some club/bar. I'm afraid her memory is either foggy or she's intentionally telling a different story, but I'm afraid that's probably the couch in my home.


I'm beyond devastated by this. My perfect life has come crashing down."
"Thing is, even if she had the money for a weekly visit, getting better is not a priority to her. It is a priority to YOU but not to her. That's very clear from what you say. So you can either:

1. Accept this is just the way your mom is and cut ties or continue to exhaust yourself
2. Make any contact conditional on her genuinely seeking help (which won't work since even if she goes, if she doesn't genuinely put in the effort, it won't do anything)
3. Continue as-is (not sustainable).

There's a saying which is used a lot on here: don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm. That's basically your situation with your mom. You can't make her get better; you can't make her WANT to get better. All you can do is adjust your own expectations (and scale back contact because you CANNOT for your own health and your own family's sake continue to enable her unhealthy behaviors).

TL;DR: your mom has a mental illness or at minimum deep issues paired with an unwillingness to change. You cannot change her. You may also want to check out r/raisedbynarcissists and r/justnomil and see if any of the resources there are helpful to you."
"For real, if I saw a grown ass woman *crying and screaming* on the bus, I'd get me and my kid off the fucking bus."
"&gt;I can't imagine it's any fun being alone for days at a time multiple times per month

Of course not. But it's also hard for me being away from home. I miss my daughter more than anything when I'm gone. It breaks my heart to leave, so my wife isn't the only one hurt by this. But I just don't know what to do. I've been a pilot all my adult life. This is what I'm know, it's what I'm educated for, and it's simply the best way for me to provide for my family. I understand that being home alone with the child(ren) is difficult, but I don't think I should be made to feel like a bad father or bad husband because I have to work. "
"From your deleted comment in this thread:

&gt;I've known him for 6 years, dating for 3, engaged for 1.

Your previous thread from 7 months ago:

Just curious OP, were you lying then, or are you lying now? Or both?"
"You've had some good advice. Let me add something for your shopping cart. Buy a big bottle of Nature's Miracle. It's used for pet odors, human odors, and more. It's enzymatic and breaks down these kinds of odors. It's safe for most fabrics and the like. You can put it on things as needed and it should make a huge difference in just a few days. Do this on the mattress for a few days. Just a light spray over it, let it dry, make up the med. after a week, once a week should keep it down and you can do it when you wash the sheets. They make laundry additives too. "
You're a little defensive. 
Or an investment in never being asked for a loan again.
"This is not a reasonable request, OP.

Show her this thread and our replies.  She needs to find a therapist of her own to deal with her insecurity, and she needs to leave you alone if you haven't given her a reason to distrust you (by cheating in the past).  I assume you haven't.  "

"At work, I shared a station with this guy who always left a lot of trash behind. Coffee cups, candy wrappers, receipts etc. When he didn't listen I saved all his crap in a plastic bag and at the end of my shift I dumped it all on the chair."

"You've got to let your landlord know what's going on. 

Tell them you moved there specifically for that job. Also explain that your employer is concerned about your living situation due to the incident that occurred, and that you've been warned it can affect your employment status. 

Ask your landlord if they'll let you out of the lease if you can find someone else to move in – or if you can pay a fee to break it. 

Most importantly, express that you'd like them to maintain discretion as not to make the situation worse. 

I don't mean to scare you, but this girl is off her rocker. Regardless of what happens with work, you've got to get out of there before August. "
"Hey OP, google ""idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep time"" and see if that rings any bells. Sounds like it could be. "
At 13 I looked like a fucking raccoon my eyes were so caked with makeup- it's normal. That's the age where a lot of girls start to experiment. You sound super judgmental and high-and-mighty. Mind your own business and stop treating your neighbors life like a soap opera because you're bored. 
"I found this out in my own relationships of years past. You can't force someone to feel positive or happy, it only builds resentment.

Right now, you are feeling resentful.

Have an ""I"" message talk with him. Maybe something like, ""You know, lately I feel so restricted and upset when you tell me that we can't be together if I'm not positive.""
It's the hard truth.
It's one thing to say, ""Could you try to be more positive?"" but another to say, ""Stop being negative. Be positive/happy.""

The fact that he threatened the relationship over such a thing is absurd.

If he still cannot fathom you having an emotional setting other than ""positive"" then tell him to go fuck himself first, and then a stepford wife."
"&gt; She's not consenting to this relationship. Your needs and desires do not supersede her consent.

He is convinced he knows what she wants more than she knows herself. 

I'm seeing why she is avoiding him."
"The only piece of advice you are going to get, is to dump him.

Anything else is stupid and self-destructive.

You need to start working on getting yourself to a place, emotionally and functionally, where you can live without him. He is going to continue to deceive you and cheat on you, and he's going to do it with drama-seeking idiot women who like to harass you. That is how he is choosing to live his life. Everytime he goes back to visit his kids, he's gonna fuck their mother. Your presence as his 'girlfriend' changes nothing, except makes you miserable, and risks you becoming Baby Mama #4 and then you are stuck with this asshole for life.

Accepting three years of this is *insane*. That is literally *insane*. Get out now."
"Please contact both the the police officer and the counselor to update them about the most recent development from the obsessive ex.  Read Gift of Fear by Gavin de Becker.  Also, notify the Security Office at the college if you're still in school or at the job if you're working.  Let your parents and friends know what is going on.  You are, imho, right to be scared about the stalking by this guy."
"It's not really two wrongs make a right, it's apologies from each side acknowledging the wrongdoing that makes a right."
"I've given up hope at this point in my parents ever having my back. They never have. They always make excuses for him and why he acts the way he does. For a long time I tried to rationalize it, but at this point it's clear he's the favorite for whatever reason. "
"This is EXACTLY the type of situation posted there. 

Sure, there are some MILs who are just terrible people. But the vast majority over there are doing things out of genuine love. They love their kids, they think they know what's best for their kids, and the kid is so used to the MIL steamrolling over him that he doesn't even care. Or notice. 

You need to nip this in the bud immediately. Your mother and sister should be the ones giving input without final say, the opposite of how it is now. Grow a spine for your fiancée's sake."
Son should pay the bill for whatever fix the daughter needs. 
"Absolutely. Counseling for the daughter too. Even though hair grows back, having your physical appearance altered without her consent while she's asleep and by someone she should be able to trust/feel safe around has got to be somewhat traumatic. Just because it's not permanent doesn't mean it's not violating. "
At the very least the Xbox should be gone until her hair grows back to her shoulder. 
"Your husband is a terrible person. God only knows the issues your daughter will have knowing that her own father excuses assault when she's the target because she's just too ""annoying"" to deserve his love and protection. He is teaching her that her body is something for other people to take their frustrations out on; and he is teaching your son that it's alright to physically attack girls in order to work out his frustrations. (Good luck with the consequences of *that* lesson as your son ages.)

But let's be real, OP, It's not just the father who is the problem here. Your son is a spoilt, unfeeling, nasty little shit. And when he attacks his sister, *your* response is a week of grounding and no video games. A week! your daughter will have to live with the consequences of his actions for *months*, and your response is a slap on the hand with a wet tissue. No wonder your son is such a shit. You and his father clearly set the most minimal consequences, if any, for his terrible behaviour, which is why he thinks it's acceptable.

Dollars to doughnuts, when one day he's arrested for assaulting other girls because they annoy him, you and your husband will be the types of parents who throw up your hands and say ""We just don't understand, he's always been such a good boy! (She must have been asking for it.)""

Don't kid yourself that your daughter feels any less betrayed by you than her father right now. One week, good grief. I'm betting it's not the first time you and her father have rug-swept bad behaviour by your son. Only consistent non-parenting produces a teenager who thinks it's acceptable to shear his sister as punishment. He'd probably be a perfectly normal boy with different parents.

For me this would be divorce worthy. And yeah, I know relationships jumps to ""break up"" very easily, but your husband is not a good father - to either of your kids. He is actively damaging both their development. And frankly, if I'd found son playing with video games afterwards, I would have gone to the garage for a hammer and smashed his game and play system all to shit in front of his face, and if his father replaced them I would do it again and again, until daughter's hair was back at the old length.

I suspect, however, that you who think a week's grounding is sufficient will do neither of these things, and both your children will suffer in the long run because of it.

Edit: thank you for the gold, kind redditor /u/lakehermit!"
"I dated this man too. It was always about HIM. He's tired, he needs 10 hours of sleep, he wants to play X, he's broke. But I was tired, I needed sleep, I wanted to do X, and I was broke too. I got tired of trying while he just did nothing but worry about himself and dumped him and found someone so much better for me. Woohoo"
"Well, that's good. I can see why he would want you to find out everything first, but how would you without basically accusing them to begin with?"
"It's one cat, seriously? Cover the furniture or commit to washing blankets and cleaning frequently. Maybe give the cat her own corner where her food bowls and a cat tree are located so you're not tripping over anything.

Also if someone acted the way you were with my animals, I would break up with them. Asking him to give up his cat is like giving up a child. As someone else said they're a package deal, take it or leave it. "
he knows she's not cheating because he snoops on her phone and her FB messages and posts chunks on reddit. because he's a loser. his post history makes me feel sorry for her. 
"Also CPS is overworked as is. There simply aren't enough homes to place every child in the system. Many kids don't go into the system at all - even though they probably should be - cause there's no placement. Most kids don't enter the system unless there's some serious neglect or abuse going on. If this is a one time incident, that kid's not going anywhere. "
Wait... how do you know he's gay?
"If it really was your fault then you definitely need to talk to a psychologist because that means you're a 21 year old adult that had a tantrum, which indicates you don't have coping skills.

Either way, I think it is prudent to talk to a professional."
"Obviously you two never clarified what ""casual"" meant. His casual meant something like ""we're dating, just taking it slower"", yours meant, ""i can fuck anybody i want and see my ex at the same time""


Your whole post reeks of desperation to try and justify your behavior. You can twist your words and jump through loopholes to portray your behavior in good moral standing through technicalities, or you can just own up to your damn self and make sure it doesn't happen again in the future with someone else.


Seriously. With the ambiguity of ""casual"", there is absolutely no point where you wouldn't have questioned yourself, ""is it okay for me to do this? shouldn't I ask him?"". Especially with all the crap you told him about trying to get over the ex and all. You knew what you were doing. You knew you should have cleared things if you wanted his respect and his trust. Instead you took the selfish route, show complete lack of remorse/empathy, and just wave it all off. Come on."
This post is the reason people should live together for atleast a year before getting married.
"My husband left his PhD program with a master's to work in industry, and he's very happy he did so. He was around 27 when he did this, and now he's making basically 5 times what he would have if he stayed in academia, and about as much as a starting tenure positions. He also loved that his work is ""meaningful"" in that he's making products that get real world use immediately and helping to save lives. There are also R&amp;D positions in his company and other companies (like the one I work at) that offer more benefits and stability. Just some food for thought."
"&gt;That's not a coincidence. Cheaters frequently become paranoid that their partner is cheating on them. It's called projecting.

This is kinda what my GF did, and now we have the issue u mentioned. 

"
Basically he is saying he has the right to ignore those emotions. Literally the most dickish thing ive ever read 
"From OP's other comments, he's been assigned housing and got stuck with the short end of the stick. It should be pretty easy to prove this."
What does he do for you? What are the direct benefits that you are enjoying from being in this relationship? Do a pro and cons analysis. If the cons are more than the pros...then.. this relationship is unequal and deters you from having a full life.
"&gt; But I still feel completely selfish for even thinking about what I want to do and not putting him first.

Do you understand how unhealthy that is?

"
"The point is that might negatively impact his relationship with his girlfriend. She appears to be super excited about this trip, and he is going to tell her that he cannot go. Having the phobia is okay and understandable, but depending on their specific situation, OP and his girlfriend will have do decide how it fits into their relationship.

The end goal of really any relationship is to be able to do things with your significant other that they enjoy. If he finds that his relationship is limited by his phobia he may wish to seek a way to lessen the effects of his phobia.

I can see a few scenarios where such a phobia would cause friction in a relationship. Such as one half of the relationship loving the beach, or further down the line the kids asking if they can go take dad to build sandcastles. Really, at this moment being a young relationship, it doesn't really matter too much, but it isn't a bad idea for OP to consider his phobia and his future.

Edit: I edited this comment a bit to rework the tone."
The book is amazingly helpful. It's got some fruity stuff in it but 85% of it is just solid advice. 
"Ha. 

If she felt bad she wouldn't be buying $2000 worth of makeup. She would be paying you.

If she felt bad she would gladly lend you her car

If she felt bad she wouldn't be buying sets of books

If she felt bad she wouldn't ruin your romantic trip to London."
"Worst case scenario what would you need to be there for to stop him from doing? Like, for real? What precisely are you there to do? "
"So bisexual doesn't have to mean ""like both genders equally and exactly the same"". It's perfectly possible to have different kinds of relationships with men and with women.

However it doesn't sound like you're actually *attracted* to John. It's possible to love someone and love spending time around them, but not actually want to have a sexual relationship with them. Being close to, and even intimate with other people that you trust feels nice - that's natural, but don't confuse it with wanting to have a relationship with them.

It's clear that you've got more thinking to do about what you want, but you actually don't have to 'make a decision' about your sexuality at all, ever. Nobody can reasonably demand that of you either. 

If your feelings about John are ""maybe it would be nice to date him"" then that doesn't sound like a good reason to be investing yourself in a serious relationship with him right now. It might be wise to just keep exploring what you're into for a while and not get pulled into anything serious."
"Anger issues can be managed if the person with the issues is willing to do the work. Literally nothing that you wrote indicates that your boyfriend is interested in changing. Why should he? You've stayed through everything so far, so what incentive is there to change? "
"Dude, you need to relax, in all seriousness. We may not have a full comprehension as to how terrifying the ocean is for you, but everyone here is trying to help you by explaining that avoiding rather than managing your phobia could do yourself a disservice. You're not the only one who's had near-death experiences, y'know. It's not healthy to use ""avoidance"" as a coping strategy and it could affect your future if you refuse to get yourself help."
"Giving guardianship of a child should have nothing to do with whose feelings you will hurt. It should be solely based on who can provide the best life(financially, emotionally, etc.) for the child.

If your parents are the best choice then that is it! Besides, his parents are 20 years older and not well off....would they really WANT to raise a child?"

"&gt;I trust him when he says nothing happened between them

Welllll...something DID happen between them. Three weeks of daily calls. I'd never call anyone that often who wasn't my partner. Just because it's not physical doesn't mean it's not unfaithful.

&gt; He says I should be over it by now.

He gave you a whole 24 hours to get over him running to his ex for emotional support instead of you and you're still upset? Wow, what a prince."
"Your edit implies that you're now sharing your vacation with her family. If that's the case, I suggest doing a completely different trip. Even better, wait until she's 21 and do a proper adult vacation."
"I know that a year sounds like a lot when you are 18, but it really is not. And especially not when you are treated like this! Leave him. Now. You will find yourself grateful later."
"This makes no sense. His fake account is a regular IG just like his real account; they both follow you so it doesn't have any special access to your IG; anything he sees from his fake, he would see on from his real. I don't get that?"
You need to end this relationship. She doesn't respect you and if you forgive her again she will just do it again. Trust people when they show you who they are with their actions. You need to cut contact with her or as much as you can and reach out to family and friends for support. 
"Sounds like she may live with you for the rest of her life. And that might actually be ok. Your relationship sounds like its pretty good overall. If given a choice between caring for my loving, kind, warm parent who is a wonderful grandparent but disorganized and bad at life versus watching her inevitably sink out on her own I would begrudgingly choose to have her stay with me. She'd drive me nuts. But I would be a million times sadder watching her fail out on her own. If she was actually ok out on her own and happy with her life even if it was a totally different life than the one I wanted for her, I would let her do that and just not worry about it and chalk it up to ""she's happy."" 

There aren't a lot of choices here--she isn't going to change and accepting that is the only way you can figure out what is going to work for you all in the future. Good luck. You and she both sound like nice people."

Your friend is a clueless asshole. She's shaming you. You need a new best friend. 
"There is no doubt it will be hard but it is necessary at this point!  Next time your invited to a family function simply state, ""I will be bringing my husband and if that's a problem I will not be attending.""  ""In fact, in the future if you invite me to a family function, I will always assume my husband is invited as well, and if that is not your intentions don't bother inviting me. "" 

Im sure once you draw this hardline in the sand your family will respond appropriately. And if any don't, you simply stop going to any functions they may have.  Your family needs to know that your husband comes first and will always be your priority. Best of luck! "

"I'm not sure. OP did mention being almost to the point of tears. That's a pretty strong reaction for it not to be in misophonia territory.

"As someone who hates being tickled, I'm just going to step in to say...  Please. This is not fun and games for you, even if it is for him. Just leave temporarily. You don't have to be with a man who doesn't respect you.

It didn't, it hurt terribly and I'd even pee on him sometimes. It didn't stop so I left. I did, however, get my screen name from him, ha. Last laugh and all. But seriously, get away from this man. He's not listening to you at all. "

"&gt; You are asking me to fulfill an obligation I do not have by spending my time and money congratulating and pretending to be happy for strangers I do not know nor will I likely see again, and there is nothing redeeming about that scenario.

What the fuck? Does he normally talk like this?

The thing that offends me the most in this post is not that he is changing his mind at the last minute, nor that he lied about buying plane tickets (though these are really offensive), it's that when you ask him about the flights, he immediately comes out with this *bullshit* language about how you are being unreasonable by asking him to attend to a wedding he already agreed (and by all accounts, wanted) to go to. 

""Nothing redeeming about that scenario""? ""Fulfill an obligation I don't have""? ""Please be considerate""? Who the fuck does he think he's talking to? Can't he just say, ""I have changed my mind and don't feel comfortable going""? 

I feel like he's using fancy language in an effort into manipulating you into thinking he has a leg to stand on. He doesn't. He lied to you about buying the tickets, and is trying to use fancy language to make *you* look like the unreasonable one. 

And yes, the fact that he won't make a modicum of effort for you because spending a weekend with you doesn't count as ""fun"" is pretty offensive. 

&gt; I've tried so hard to incorporate him into my life by inviting him to events with my friends **that he always bails on**

She's not harassing you. She's not doing anything overt or explicit. Hell, most of the things you mentioned barely would merit a blip on a radar. Like... This is such a nothing situation, but you're making a deal out of it for what? You should reflect on that. "
No it's not. I think it would be silly for him to just throw out condoms in a fairly fresh relationship just because you dont use them
Best advice here. Honesty while sparing her details she may not actually want to know. 
"He is an addict, plain and simple. He is manipulating your feelings and holding you emotionally hostage. 

There is no need to say or do anything but to take care of yourself. It is that simple. Avoid contact with him on any level. You owe him nothing.

Embrace those around you who support you; you're who matters. Don't forget that! Don't forget that it all begins with love... giving it, receiving it, and learning it begins with you loving yourself enough to walk away from the negative forces in your life.

Im going to make this easy, and give it to you in a couple easy steps:


1. Consider if you like her in a romantic capacity


2. If Yes, text her this: 


""Hey. I know you asked me the other day what i thought if you weren't just hitting on me because you were drunk that night. And if I'm being honest with you, I would really like that."" Then see how she responds.. Then if you really do like her and she responds well, tell her you like her and you want to buy her coffee, dinner, etc. 


If you don't like her back, tell her. But you may lose a friend if she really is into you, and you don't return the feelings. But thats part of life, and people move on.

She hasn't been your friend for quite some time. And *certainly* can't be trusted to stand up with you on your wedding day. I'm already shuddering at the notion of her having the mic for a toast at your reception. Drop her as maid of honor, drop her as a bridesmaid, drop her as a friend. She's already dropped you."
"&gt; Remind Andy that part of the reason you broke up with Josh is that he thought his dick was the only part of the relationship that mattered.

NOOOOOPE! Do NOT do this. No man ever wants to her a woman talk about her ex-lover's penis under any circumstances. Men are in denial about the fact that other men even have penises.

&gt;remind him that you are not Kate.

Good idea. Kate seems obsessed about penis size. Make this about her insecurities and not about you or Andy or even Josh. 

&gt;You're sorry if not stepping in sooner gave him the wrong impression - you were trying to give her a chance to fix the situation on her own, and apparently put too much faith in her

Absolutely apologize for this. 

&gt;they aren't really jokes and she needs to get her shit together without taking it out on you and Andy

We have a winner.

No, tell them that she's out of the wedding altogether. promote one of them to MoH and ask them not to try and fix things, like you said, and leave it at that. "
"It doesn't really matter what actually happened. She was probably lying, but it's totally possible that she miscarried or terminated. Most pregnancies actually fail before women even know they're pregnant. The egg doesn't ""take"" for whatever reason and gets passed during her next period. Many more end in the first trimester, which is why you're not supposed to announce a pregnancy too early. Chances are you'll just have to deal with telling everyone you lost it.

Or, you can shrug your shoulders and tell her that shitty actions have shitty, career-threatening consequences and that maybe this is the warning she needed to stop cheating with/on people.

"You advised her to talk to her managers about not being happy on the first day, yet you doubt about doing the same thing about something far, far worse than that? She is literally harassing you!

She sounds batshit insane, and you really, really need to start recording everything and escalate it. I doubt it will ever get better, and you can't really be 100% sure she won't one day make a claim that could jeopardise your career. Don't take chances here, you are on the right."

"I have known my husbands family since I was 10. When I first met his older sister, Monica, I was told that she just had severe social anxiety. She never left the house and spent most days in her room. Through the years, she got worse, completely neglecting her personal hygiene, not interacting with anyone but her family members (and barely even them). 

When she started having what we would later come to know was schizophrenic episodes, my husbands Mother was at a complete loss about what to do. [I've taken out examples of Monica's episodes because someone PM'd me and knew who she was because of them]. 

Monica refused to see any kind of mental health professional. Eventually, she did something that allowed her Mother to have her involuntarily committed. She was in a psychiatric hospital for two years, and is still doing outpatient therapy. Although she is medicated and in therapy, she still never leaves the house. She does the bare minimum when it comes to personal hygiene, and will still sometimes say things that seem ""off"" to me. For example, we were driving down the highway once and she saw a billboard with a local government official asking people to get involved in our community (wording was ""what will you do for your community""), and she said ""they keep putting those up where they think I'm going to be because he (referring to the government official) really wants my help"". 

Anyways, Monica loves kids, and I won't deny that she's a great aunt. The only time that she seems truly happy is when she's playing with her nieces and nephews. My husbands siblings seem to have no problem allowing Monica to babysit their kids, and they often pay her to do it (this is the closest thing Monica has to a job). My husband's brother's wife once voiced some discomfort with Monica babysitting to me, but said she'd rather not make waves in the family. 

I don't feel that way. Monica is still not mentally healthy, and probably never will be. The thought of her having one of her episodes while alone with my son terrifies me. She still has a hard time being responsible for herself, let alone a one year old child. I'm fine with Monica spending time with my son and having a relationship with him. The more love that he has in life the better. But I'm still extremely uncomfortable allowing her to babysit unsupervised. 

The other day my husband was visiting with my son at his Mother's house (where Monica lives). At about midday he calls me from the grocery store asking if I needed anything. I asked how my son was doing because for some strange reason he hates the grocery store more then anything else. Hubby told me that he'd left my son alone with Monica at home.

I got so angry. Aside from the fact that I don't believe Monica is a safe caretaker, my husband had left my son alone with her when I'd expressly asked him not to until we could have a good discussion about it. I (very calmly) asked him to leave the grocery shopping until later and go back to my son. He told me that I was overreacting. I was at work so I couldn't do anything, and said we'd talk about it later. Honestly, I was kind of an anxious mess the rest of the day. 

Husband, meanwhile, called his MOTHER to ask her opinion on the situation. She told him that I was being ridiculous and that it was extremely hurtful to both Monica and her that I was ignoring all of the progress Monica made in the past few years. She told husbands siblings that I thought that Monica was crazy and didn't want her around my child, which is not true and I never said. Now all of husbands family is angry at me. Monica sent me a photo of her medicines, with the caption ""see I'm still on my crazy pills"".

Both husband's brother and other sister have called me and told me to stop ""bullying"" Monica. The thing is, I don't think I'm bullying her. I think I'm being a responsible parent. If Monica was a stranger who I was interested in hiring as a Nanny, and she told me her mental health history, I wouldn't hire her in a million years. I don't think I should make an exception because it's ""family"". 

I'm just looking for some opinions on the situation. Am I being unreasonable? Or is it my husband's family that's overreacting? 

Thanks in advance. 

Tl;Dr- Husband's sister has a history of schizophrenia. Although she is medicated and in therapy I still don't believe that she is 100% healthy, and don't trust her to babysit my child alone. Husbands family think I'm over protective. Am I? 

Edit: Just to clarify, I love Monica and I love that she cares so deeply for my child. She was never meant to find out that I didn't want her babysitting alone, I knew how much that would hurt her. 

UPDATE: You have all given me a great deal to think about. Thank you so much for the outpouring of support, and to those who PM'd be privately with more personal comments. I can't respond personally to all of you but I've read and taken to heart all of your comments! Will definitely be checking out r/justnomil.

"Your brother went to jail because he was doing something illegal. For him to go to jail for three years, he must have been doing this over a period of several years and to a pretty high value of money. He was a fraud and a thief and deserves to be punished. What he did was unfair to every person in your home country who pays their taxes and declares their income correctly. HE is responsible for the fact he landed in jail. HIS actions put him there. 

I understand feeling bad. But please don't forget that at the end of the day, the reason he went to jail was because of his own illegal and fraudulent actions. If he wasn't doing anything wrong, he wouldn't have gone to prison. "

"So, if you're negative, it's your fault.  And if he's negative it's... your fault.  Clearly, if you were just sending him positive vibes at all times, he wouldn't ever have any problems or need to complain about anything.  \s

Yeah, you need to get out of this situation.  You have something worse here than someone who wants you to always be positive.  What you have is someone who will invent reasons to blame all of his problems on you.  "
Then do something about it and start having respect for yourself. No-one will respect someone who doesn't respect himself. 
"This is not your fault. You were a faithful husband who raised kids with this woman, and she violated years of trust by acting in a selfish and deceptive way. In the process, she exposed you to a pervasive sexually transmitted virus. You are not a schmuck. "
"You're unreasonable that you expect others to pay for your life - the taxpayers, your boyfriend, your parents.

He should not agree to live with you until you support yourself financially.  He will absolutely get stuck paying for you.

If you're going to be a family, you have to get on a better schedule and get up at a reasonable time.  That means going to bed at whatever time you need to get your 10 hours.  If you're not interested in parenting, you definitely should not live together."
Exactly. Four months is so far from LTR it actually made me chuckle. Twenty three year olds. 
"Confronting him will result in one of two ways:

1) He gets physical with her again, and blames you.

2) He gets physical with you. Then you have one of two choices:

2a) Leave and never confront him again.

2b) Call the police where he may be put in jail, in which your girlfriend and her family sound like they would be out of a living space and might very likely blame you for it if it comes to that.

Or, you help your girlfriend move out so she doesnt have to deal with the abuse any more. When she gets to a safe place with or without you, she can then focus on helping her family get away from her dad. 

You can try to convince her to call the police on her dad, but if she has not already, she likely will not in the future unless he escalates. "
"Maybe not the best advice or what you want to hear but I say do nothing. 

If she took and has it that should mean she's using it... you won't want it back I think. If she took it and sold it that should mean it's gone. If she didn't take it then you accuse her of something she didn't do.

All possibilities lead to an awkward situation and uncomfortable times ahead with no prospect of you getting your item back. 

Take it on the chin, it's gone and accept it. Not the best situation I'm sure but definitely won't be the last time a parent will let their kid down. "
"Frank, After last weekend I'm at a breaking point with our friendship. I know you care about me, but I can't keep going through this over and over. Your anger can be so all-consuming that you do and say terrible things, things that shouldn't be said to strangers, let alone people you claim to care about. 

The alcohol is a triggering factor, but not an excuse. In the end, the only one responsible for you actions is you. 

I want to be friends with the Frank who (EXAMPLE OF GOOD FRIENDSHIP), not the Frank who makes me cry. You've been my friend for 14 years, you're supposed to protect me from people who hurt me, not be one of them. 

Something has to change if we're going to continue to be in each other's lives. I don't know where this anger is coming from, but I think it might be helpful to talk to someone about it. I worry about you and I don't want to lose you as a friend. I don't know how to fix this, but please for the sake of our friendship make an appointment to talk to someone about your anger. "

"What place outside of his own home can he go to be completely alone? A single-stall bathroom?

I don't think you understand that being alone in the house feels different. It's about not being noticed. It's about complete freedom, because even if your SO insists they're fine with whatever you do people by default modulate their activity based on company. For someone whose attachment to alone time isn't as strong, it doesn't make sense because it's very difficult to explain. But for the people who do want it, it makes all the sense in the world. Just look at the other comment where the woman was on the verge of a divorce because she could never get the house to herself.

It's okay not to get it, but that doesn't make it unreasonable - just not something you personally need."

"Going off the reservation for a couple days every once in a while sounds like something that's an issue with you, not with her or your relationship.

I would engage a psychologist and see if there's something more going on with you that's causing these moments -- this could be a sign of something like bipolar or other disorder that you could get under control or at least understand better.

"You can't control the actions of another person.   

You can't control the actions of another person.   

Nothing you do, say or think will give you the power to control the actions of another person. 

I wouldn't say your fear is irrational, a lot of relationship end due to cheating, so the fear is rational, and since someone who is cheating will lie and conceal the cheating you won't know if they are cheating, so again I would say your fear is rational.   I think the fears are real, however your concern has turned into an obsession.  You watched your mother be tortured over the years, her pain and torment are burned into your brain, which is understandable.  Which is why you've equated cheating as the worst thing that chould happen. 

Most things in life you can't control, you can only control your response, and right now your response to the mere thought of cheating is to obsess.   Obsession gives you the illusion that you are ""doing something"" about his possible cheating, but you're not.  

That old saying.  ""Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.""

Everyone must accept the fact that a SO might cheat, because you can't control the actions of another person.   What you can change is your response to the thought of him cheating, you can obsess, and make yourself miserable while you are in the relationship, which will lead you down a path to breaking up, or you can give 100% to the relationship and enjoy it to the fullest. 

The fact that you recognize the problem means you are in control of the situation.   Start working with a therapist in order to free yourself of this obsession.    


But if he starts acting like a skunk, controlling. Abusive, manipulative , or sketchy behavior you need to end thing immediately, that is the thing you can control, It would break the cycle of abuse."

Next thing is girlfriend telling you mom has to move in because her power was shut off.

Nip this in the bud. You have a baby and are supporting your girlfriend - that's who your money is for. Your girlfriend needs to understand that you two will never get ahead if you keep bailing out her mother."
I know a girl who put her kid up for adoption at 5. She was a teen mom and about 6 months after the adoption she was already pregnant again -.-
"I think OP doesn't get it - we like our pets precisely because they have the best traits of people, and none of the bad. She complains that it's not human - that's precisely the point. They are *better*."

"It has nothing to do with you and isn't anything you did wrong.  It's her circumstances.

Think of it from her perspective.  She's going to have to start med school very soon.  When she does, she is going to struggle with the workload and the high standards expected.  There just won't be enough hours in the day or energy left over for a relationship.  The more logical, and kinder, thing to do is to just not get involved.

The heartbreak over leaving/ending a relationship is always worse than the disappointment of not starting one."
"I'm not quite sure why you don't go out yourself more often? You've got friends who will hang out with you, it sounds like. Why, exactly, do you need boyfriend's approval to do so? He's going out with his friends...you go out with yours. I know sleazeball might be there, but what you do is shut that shit down real quick, and then go have a good time. Does he not trust that you wouldn't do anything with your friend's asshole boyfriend?"
"Woah! This is not a healthy outlook. 

Codependent relationships are suuuper damaging. Like, they damage people in the longterm.

"Google discogs and then put in the pressing number to see if it is actually valuable. A lot of first editions are valuable, but later pressings are not. 

If they are valuable, and you really want everyone to shut up about it, write your aunts name on each one. The value will drop, you'll still have the records, and nobody will get any value for them. Tell your family you had them appraised for insurance and found that since they were written on, they aren't worth as much as you thought."
He sounds like he's insecure and is over-compensating.  He might grow out of it when he matures (assuming you stay with him that long).
"So, basically, your husband is teaching both of your children that it is okay for boys (men) to assault girls (women) cuz they're just askin' for it.

"Okay, here's a reason. These days, it's very hard to travel between the US and Iran for *everybody.* Talk to an immigration lawyer even though you're a US citizen (I assume) so you know what you're in for when you arrive back at Customs. The truth is you can't know for sure that the travel restrictions won't come back at any point in the next four years, possibly trapping you or family members abroad. Don't make getting married in Iran the hill you die on, because it might not be possible at all. Choose a third country everyone can safely and reliably get to. 

(This isn't legal advice. I am a lawyer but I'm not your lawyer and can't advise you here, except to say ""yo international travel to Iran might not be too great an idea, ask for professional guidance before you set your heart on it."")"
"Did you tell him?  I don't understand how people can't be transparent.  I literally tell my husband ""Please compliment me.""  I don't fish for compliments anymore, I just ask for them, he's gotten really good at it.  No hinting, no digging, no beating around the bush.  ""Hey I need verbal affirmation that you find me attractive."""
"Obviously, you were not doing as well as you thought. It's time to step it up and be her partner. To you, this seems sudden, but to her, it's been stewing for months and months. Do shit around the house without being asked. Take out the trash, start dinner, scrub the toilets. Tell your wife ""Hey, why don't you go take some time for yourself and I'll put Susie to bed from now on"" 

I've been alone in my marriage before, and it sucks. Not only are you stressed out because you're doing ALL THE THINGS, you have enormous pressure because if everything isn't up to snuff, the wife is usually the one who gets the criticism. She has been trying to tell you that she needs you to help her, and you went and smoked weed with your friends the entire vacation while your wife took care of your child and then got sulky at her because you were lonely. 

If I felt like a single parent, then I would take steps to become single. Your marriage may be retrievable, but it's going to take a lot more talking and a lot more effort on your part. "
"Someone previously mentioned Sam's mother as being a narcissist and I think it fits the bill. Her facebook is filled with 5 paragraph long posts about the goodness she instills in her daughters, her values, how wholesome and wonderful she is, etc etc. They are very, very absorbed in themselves. I think if it is genuinely narcissism or perhaps BPD then there really is no sense in trying to reason with them. You can't argue with people who honestly don't think they are doing any wrong. "
Ohh..right. I guess I need some sleep....
I don't think that she was necessarily expressing regret rather than curiosity. You should of course speak to her about it.

"Walk away.  If she's not willing to fix her problems, this is only going to become more of a mess.  And if you're only really with her romantically because it's the price of admission for getting to be with him, it's hard to say that her jealousy is coming from an entirely irrational place.  Just admit that this was a well-intentioned but failed experiment, and give them some space to work things out together while you get over your feelings before they crystallize into something more than infatuation."
"There is picking a fight and a teacher picking a fight. I think this leans more toward the latter. Herold should know better than to become aggressive in a classroom setting whether he thought the necklace was inappropriate or not he stepped into Axel's personal space in a classroom with other students present and reached for the necklace he and other students could have been hurt if there was a fight that erupted as a result.
Is the necklace an issue maybe but as you cited it is not in the school regs. Are female students allowed to wear necklaces or other jewelry in class?
It is possible the necklace doesn't break apart easily when pulled or the shark tooth may be sharp which may put Axel at risk if there is some acting out. Your  thoughts? "
"The choking statistic is absolutely TRUE. If this is going on she needs to leave the situation immediately. Talk to her, trusted adults that are in your lives and ensure that she has a safe place to go be it yours or a friends.

I don't understand why the length of time you know someone would give them a pass to do what they want and get away with it. Focus on your husband and not this woman. 
"Not if that ""something"" was watching my own partner play in a band!! No way in hell would I just get up and walk out because I was bored. Talk about disrespectful.  

Edit: and the fact that you go out with your friends most weekends just makes this worse. If you see them so often, it shouldn't be a big deal to skip hanging out with them for ONE HOUR so you can support your girlfriend. 

I hope she dumps you."
"I am going to take a very different view of this than most people here. I think if it's really weighing on you heavily and there's no way you can reconcile yourself to church every week and donations to your parish then you need to tell her, but maybe there's a way to reframe what church means to you so you can still enjoy going with your wife, even if you don't believe. 

There's a podcast that I've been listening to called Harry Potter and the Sacred Text where two people in divinity school read the Harry Potter books as if they were a holy text. It's fascinating and beautiful, but mostly it's taught me that you don't have to believe that something is objectively true to be able to find meaning and relevance in it. If your minister is any good, in his or her sermon he or she probably takes a passage of the Bible and makes it relevant to your life. And you don't have to believe that god created the earth or that Jesus made blind men see to be able to take meaning from a text and apply it to your own life. Sure maybe praying seems a little bit pointless and communion is just weird, but prayers can be a great time for personal reflection - even if it's just reminding yourself of the best thing that happened this last week, or a time to check in with yourself on how you're doing on a personal goal and how you could keep it up or do better this week. And surely some bread and wine (or grape juice) once or twice a month isn't going to kill you.

One of the things churches do best, even now, is providing community. You must know people at church. You've seen how the congregation rallies around someone who is sick or grieving. Your minister's full time job is making sure everyone in the community is taken care of, whether that is by providing an ear or a shoulder to lean on, or by informing the rest of the community of what they can do to help. And you pay him so that when you or your wife get sick, or need surgery, he or she is there to help and to organize the rest of the congregation to help. 

I'm not saying that you shouldn't tell your wife, or that you must keep going to church, or even that thinking about church this way will automatically make everything better, I'm just trying to show you that there might be a way for you to enjoy and appreciate it, even if you don't believe in the Sky Father. "
"To be honest, I'm not *that* worried about the money.  I had the extra to spend, otherwise I wouldn't have done it in the first place.  So it's not the cost, it's the fact that it was meant for my nephew, regardless off its monetary value that's pissing me off. And I strongly doubt that he would ever consider paying me back for it, especially since he owes my parents thousands and has made no indication of paying that back.  Thanks for the response though.

"Oh my god, do NOT go to grad school 'because you haven't got a good job and you don't have any better ideas'. This is the trap that so many Americans fell into in the past 20 years, and now we have a massive student debt problem.

He likes hurting you during sex.

He tells you what to wear.

He now tells you to get surgery for him.

"Youre passive aggressive. Hes lazy. You deal with problems and stupid fights by being more passive aggressive, and he deals with fights by ignoring them and calling names. You hate little things, like him touching you with his leg. He hates cleaning up after himself. Instead of talking out problems and fixing them, you both decide to yell until one of you caves. You normally end of caving because you dont want to deal with it, and then you act passive aggressively causing more problems.

To be completely honest, this is a cycle you two likely wont be able to change while together."
This is a perfect description of what has happened.
"This doesn't sound like a grudge towards your friend, it looks like he's trying to keep you from reaching out for support - very manipulative behaviour.  Does he often yell at you for disrespecting him?  Do you feel like you're walking around on eggshells to keep him happy?  Undermining your support network is one of the first things an abuser will do.  Look at the healthy relationship quiz at loveisrespect.org."
She only gets the contact with you that you allow...nobody was forcing you to pick up the phone after all. She sounds like a handful. 
"I hate liars because of you confront them they just lie and you've tipped them off that you are suspicious.  Making it that much harder to learn the truth. 

I also don't waste my time or energy worrying.  If I seriously thought my wife was cheating I'd hire a PI and learn the truth for myself.  If she is cheating she's not going to admit the truth, otherwise she wouldn't be lying to me in the first place."
"It's great that you all believe he loves you enough not to cheat on you. And it's also great that you seem to have a healthy view on attraction and understand that him being attracted to her doesn't undermine how much he loves or is attracted to you. 

But part of that component of human sexuality means that, as one-half of a monogamous couple, you remove yourself from those tempting situations. 

No more snaps and texts, limited or no facebook interaction. He doesn't get to unilaterally decide that she's tagging along to social gatherings. 

If he respects your relationship, he will take the necessary steps to remove the temptation. Obviously since he works with her daily there is not much that can be done there, but he absolutely can make the decision to keep the relationship purely professional. 

Problem is, he has to want to do this to avoid temptation. It's not something you can really provide an ultimatum on, otherwise you're likely to build resentment. 

You're not being unreasonable, but it's time for a sit-down talk so he can take the steps that he knows are necessary to keep this relationship on-the-level. "
now im confused. how is asking your brother why he didn't give his son the laptop you bought your nephew considered going in guns blazing? I don't know how else to communicate? 
"I think any type of confrontation that directly implies that the brother took laptop from nephew is going to be received poorly, and in family dynamics this is especially tricky. It's not a bad thing for OP to want to seek out a more subtle approach to getting to the bottom of this considering the touchy subject and family dynamic. 

As a side note, if you don't know how to communicate in any way other than confrontation that may be an issue for you an a reason to reevaluate your social skills. "
"I think you'll just have to ask her regarding depression + dancing, and try to avoid accusation/offense. It affects people differently, dancing could be her way of avoiding her problems. 

I definitely think some couples counseling + honest/nonjudgemental talk is required. What would it take for her to feel happy with herself? Focus on her problems with herself instead of their effect on the relationship. "
you you mean you kissed a girl who isnt your girlfriend.
"Seriously, people here are being crazy harsh to the brother that he ""stole"" from his son, but it's not like he's using it to play WoW while laughing at his son's desire to play Minecraft.  

Parents in families with limited means become accustomed to thinking of all family resources as shared resources that need to be allocated based on need.

When I was a teenager, my aunt gave my family a car with the idea that my sister and I would have something to drive.  My parents used that car a lot, and I have absolutely zero bad feelings about it.  Sometimes my parents needed to get places more than we did!"
"&gt; I would rather have a part-time step-son to love and bond with than a full-time bill for one I only see on holidays, if ever

&gt; I am so angry with her and her son's entire existence in my life

Make up your mind.  If this kid is just going to be a living reminder of your partner's mistake in trying to move on too quickly and carelessly with a woman he couldn't trust, then consider the child support a convenience fee for not having to deal with that - or her - on a regular basis.  If you want your daughter to have a brother, or at least don't want to resent the baby for having been born into a lousy situation he didn't ask to be part of, you need to quit treating this woman like the enemy or fixating on what she *should* be doing and talk to her.  At the very least, drop the marriage plans until you know what *you* want out of the family arrangement and whether that's going to be feasible."
"I'd be pretty fucking pissed and I would expect my SO to call out their friend's shit. It'd also be the end of that friend coming over (I wouldn't ban my SO from seeing them, but that friend wouldn't be welcome in my home). I'm not the most forgiving person though."
My suggestion is you send a sincere email back and ask if their is a Charity or cause your SIL would like you to donate to in your nieces honour. Organise in advance some flowers to be sent on the correct date next year. 
"Why do you feel it's convenience? You didn't explain that.

"Your husband is being ridiculous, plenty of people enjoy active lives with travel and adventure. It is not childish (which seems like an interesting descriptor for a guy in his 40's to tell a woman in her 20's).

It just sounds like he was pretty happy with the way things were (and set into his ways) and change frightens and confuses him. Rather than roll with it and try, he just wants to belittle your new interests."
"Wowowow, what? That exists?"
Surely he'd be better off facing his fears somewhere he can peace out and go home if it's too much rather than throwing himself all in?
Good idea. Also a new email account that she only users on someone else's computer
"I'm going to agree with most of the comments and your girlfriend. I also don't like wasting food when I know how difficult it is to come by for many people. If she was willing to cook and eat it, then what's the big deal?

I am also like her, regarding insects, animals, etc. I don't think there's anything wrong with me. I'm just sensitive and compassionate, especially towards beings that we are kind of screwing over by invading their space and then killing them when they're in ""our"" space. Sorry, but the insects were here first. 

The sense of entitlement people have really irks me sometimes."
Seriously. I got some for lunch just because this post made me crave okra. 
"I'm so sorry for your loss :(

Is there anyway you can reach out to your husband without going there in person?  Writing a letter is probably the best idea.  You can get all of your thoughts out, re-write it a couple of times to match what you really want to say, and he can read it at his own pace in private.

I also suggest and urge you to enter grief counseling.  Losing your sister is horrible enough, but this situation with your husband will only add more stress.  This is so much for one person to handle, and it's okay to ask for help in dealing with your emotions."
"How is this ""easily worked through""? This is all of the above:

1. Lying
2. Invasion of privacy
3. Victim blaming/blame shifting
4. Paranoia
5. Accusing OP of lying/cheating/wanting to cheat
6. Jealousy/insecurity
7. TELLING someone their sexual orientation

That's SEVEN red flags in ONE single action. I mean, what do you want here? ""Well, after all, it's only the FIRST time he's threatened to kill me""? ""Well, after all, it's only the FIRST time I caught him screwing a prostitute""?

Where do you draw the line if not here? 

This isn't some simple misunderstanding, or miscommunication, this is he made a deceptive 2nd account to monitor his fiance out of unfounded distrust, and now thinks she's to blame because of what she looks at and likes."
"He's preparing you. So later, when he cheats on you, he can say he warned you and that you knew he was a chronic cheater, so what did you expect? Also, by telling you that he didn't cheat on *every* girlfriend, he's trying to get you to compete to be one of the ""good"" ones that he didn't ""have to"" cheat on. It's all mind games. 

This guy is trash. Dump him. "
"Compliments are fine if you really mean them, but that's not the issue at hand. This girl turned you down, man. And I know you're taking her at her word and you think she'll want a relationship with you when she knows you better. Hell, maybe she will. Maybe you'll be together and have a semi-happy relationship. It's possible.

But you'd still be *way* better off forgetting this girl as a potential romantic partner and finding someone who says yes right away. Because trust me, you'll be a lot happier with the ones that say yes right away. It takes most people decades to learn that lesson. You have a chance to learn it at 19. Find another girl, man. This one's not right for you."
You've already posted about your relationship problems with her three times in the three months you've been together. It sounds as if she really isn't as invested in this relationship as you are. I'd cut my losses. There is no way that Azo wouldn't work and that she needs a vaginal exam for a UTI. Your original impression is probably the correct one. She has something else to do that is more important to her than your vacation. 
"It sounds like you have some sexual tension with Jessica. You didn't mention Jessica's BF at all. 

If it was just you and your sister. Maybe I could see it. But you already have a third wheel... or maybe she isn't one?

Even if you would never take action. Even the hint of chemistry is often fun. Forbidden sexual tension. Like knowing it could be something but choosing otherwise. 

The moment your GF goes. It wrecks that. 

It seems odd you don't want your GF to go with you. That speaks more volumes than her wanting to come.  Rarely do couples take separate vacations.  Especially family vacations. Usually you are supposed to want her with you.  

Your GF should feel a little disconcerted that you feel she would wreck the fun. "
It hasn't always been this way. I feel like he's trying to railroad me into breaking up with him.
"Pretty sure a comment from some stranger on Reddit won't change your mind, but you need to reconsider this relationship because the dynamic is honestly weird. I'm saying this as an 18 y/o with a 21 y/o boyfriend; the difference is that I graduated high school over a year ago. Also, my bf and I met when I was 16 and he was 18. You met your girl when she was 16 and you were 20. That's honestly creepy. 

Do what you want, but I was in a relationship with a 19 y/o when I was 14. Your case isn't that extreme (obviously) but I deeply regret it now despite how much more mature I was for a 14 y/o. 

Also, let your girlfriend go to prom. She's a teenager and it's something for her to experience. 

Good luck to you, dude."

"I'm not sure if I would tell the wife, but I most certainly tell HR. Say the girl was drunk, but professed love and tried to physically kiss you. This stuff needs to be on record in case Miss 30? decides to push her agenda about making you her main squeeze.

MAKE A STATEMENT TO HR OR YOUR BOSS!"
"You never heard the phrase ""you don't need a time, you just need a place""?  And anyway, are you sure he's always with his buds instead of being with another girl?  

Anyway, you've got a dud here.  You want to be with somebody who is over the moon for your accomplishments, or be at least basically supportive and happy for you. Your life will become much better and easier when that happens.

 I think you've outgrown this relationship:  I think another celebration is in order!"
"Yeah. I don't know if it's clear that this girl went out of her way to tattle on OP, or if the director asked her why a call went unanswered &amp; she was simply responding honestly. (assuming OP as the person to field all the calls that come in when the receptionist is on the phone is the policy of the company, not something that OP does just to help the receptionist) "
"It doesn't sound like she's expecting everyone to accommodate her. Literally in the title she says ""I don't want to go anymore."" and not ""they refuse to leave the pets at home.""

Pets are a difficult issue because some people really do not enjoy being around pets, and you can't force them to suck it up because you have one (or several). The issue of respect and accommodation goes both ways. 

You can choose who you spend time with, and in that way you can make sure that those people also love having pets around. But once that's a foregone conclusion, a bit of empathy for people who think differently of pets will go a long way.

Since there are far more people who love pets and want them around at this gathering, the respectful thing to do as hosts is to understand that pets can be an issue and to not take it personally when someone declines to come because of it."
"Basically, I think you're overly upset because you took on too much stress this week.  You worked 11 hours, then played for 5 hours after that on Tuesday.  On Wednesday, you learned that you couldn't see him like you had planned (that's more stress).  Then you didn't skype &amp; play some games like you had planned because he went to his friend's house.  Etc. etc. and on top of that, you didn't reach your goal in the game.  

Seriously, go talk to a therapist.  The question of ""why am I so miserable over this?"" is a really loaded one, and requires a professional to ask about 100 other questions before even attempting to answer it.  It could be that you're afraid he's losing interest in you so you decided to be his heroine and help him in WoW in hopes that he'll like you more.  It could be  that you're starting to question if you have a problem with video games and how it affects your relationships.  Really, don't let reddit fill your mind with scary reasons/explanations.. go to a professional.  You won't regret it.  It might not be as helpful as you had hoped, but I really doubt it would make things worse for you.  It costs money, but it can help a lot.  Good luck."
If you attend without him then you're not taking it seriously either. 
"This isn't how depression works, at least not in a great deal of cases. It isn't just being sad, and a lot of people react differently to depression. "

"Added in the edit, but ""Dug through phone record and she messaged him 12 times via text between 3pm and 5pm, then told me she was leaving for the event at 5:15. No mention of meeting up with him, so she intentionally kept this from me. Lyft has her actually arriving at the event at 5:45 and puts her back home at 9:45. She doesn't message me until 10:45, and has no mention of anything again, only that she made friends and got a little too drunk. At Midnight she sends that message to him about seeing him tomorrow. 3am she calls me acting weird.""


Those were the only texts between them. Obviously they could have been talking on FB before that."
Oh god yes. I remember reading a post here now about a guy who thought he was going mad and it turned out that the co2 levels in his house were through the roof. Good call!

OP...you are 6 months into a relationship and you are having public fights to the point that others feel the need to break them up and defend you.

THIS ALONE IS NOT HEALTHY.

Now add in your offhand comment:

&gt;small fights that Jesse and I have had and she also thinks he is not great... in retrospect, I realize I shouldn't have told her these things in the heat of the moment. 

OP....you shouldn't be fighting this much at this point in your relationship.

Also...normal adults can have healthy relationships with co-workers.  The fact that your BF is jealous of this is NOT NORMAL.

OP...listen to your mentors

"
"The proper response to this ultimatum is to immediately break up. It's the most awful, hideous sort of blackmail. Nice people, even very depressed nice people, don't threaten suicide to get what they want. "
"Attraction is a very loose term that need to be qualified. OP is not happy, if he were, he wouldn't be posting here or in marriage counselling. He clearly has trouble communicating his needs and needs to be attentive to hers. Dismissing it is inviting trouble as resentment could slowly creep up on them.

It is possible to be grateful for what one has, yet address any nagging issue that presents itself. It's not either/or, it's both."
"You should never feel like anything other than #1 with your SO. You should never have any doubt in your mind that if it was between you and any other guy that she wouldn't take you first.

That relationship to me sounds like you are questioning that.

I always find these posts interesting, from the SO's point of view all of a sudden you start thinking ""If they get a long so well, why aren't they dating? or when will they realize they should be dating instead of us""."
"...cooking breakfast for dinner?

Most of what you've put feels normal. The only thing I'd be concerned about is you saying you come home and she's there and she hasn't said to you before that she'd be coming over.
I understand that they're friends too but why isn't she telling you she's coming to visit?"
"Sounds like a pretty normal parent. He didn't beat her and abuse her, he disciplined her. This girl is out of control, you see how many teenagers die everyday cuz of stupid shit like this? Having a nice chat doesn't work for everyone. Poor guy. "
"I wasn't asking to be a smart ass, it was a legitimate question. I've been out of work for eight months and I'm so under stimulated that getting out of bed in the morning is exhausting. Laziness does play a big part in it, too. I'm sure if I got up every morning and went for a jog I'd feel a million times better, but it's doubtful she has some sort of illness. For all OP knows, she could've been like this for the past five years and he just finally noticed/started to care."
"(OP is a girl)

I don't see this as ""in [her] head."" Especially when someone the other girl is good friends with goes out of his way to flick her off for no reason. In conjunction with everything else, it seems pretty clear that this girl is being extremely petty towards OP.

&gt; I think the OP should try to ignore it, and if that doesn't work, switch classes.

In case you didn't read the post, OP is already ignoring this girl. She's also actively trying to avoid her so she doesn't have to deal with her crap. That's why I'm confused as to where that person got that OP was ""so caught up in the lives of these people who obviously have no interest in interacting with [her]."" 

So half of your advice is something that she's already doing. The other half she has already addressed by saying that her particular department is small. Not all colleges offer the same class multiple times, and those that do don't always fit into a person's schedule.

That's fine that you think OP should ignore it, because I agree and think that she should just avoid this person as best she can, but don't belittle or brush it off as ""all in [her] head.""

OP, if these gestures continue to get worse like you have said you fear, just tell them to leave you alone and walk away. Don't engage them. Also if it does get worse, go to your college's security office and report it. No matter how silly you think it might seem, you want to have the escalation in writing. "

"Even if he isn't gay, someone attacking him because they think he is deserves to be punished.  It's strange that he would want to bring harm on himself like that, but what's the problem with people who physically attack someone being held responsible?"

So you could literally just have told her and it would have been fine.
"Honestly, if they want to take you to court, I'd let them.  I don't see the point in budging on this issue until then.  Let them put their money where their mouth is.  Your aunt knew what she was doing.

As a general protip--don't discuss financial matters with family.  It makes people go irrational.  "
"Thank you for this comment! Yes, I'm so disappointed in the person I'm becoming! We were talking and apparently doctors were able to do a uterus transplant and she was going on about how this is great for transwomen and soon there will be no difference between cis and trans woman, and in my mind I was like ""the transplants aren't for *you* ""

And that sucks! Ive never felt this way I'm so disappointed. You're right though. I'm so nervous, I don't want to hurt her feelings. But I do have to speak up because it will probably get worse if I don't :/ on both ends."
"That's she's transitioning is irrelevant, she's being an asshole. If she weren't transitioning would you tolerate her behaving like this?"
"&gt; Not a huge difference

You're right. It makes no difference."
"""It's a combination of martyrdom and classic one-upsmanship.""

This is exactly it. Thank you for realizing this.

Have you had to deal with someone like this? If so, what did you do that helped preserve your sanity?"
Is this a different first date to the one you posted about yesterday? 
"&gt; It's disgusting and I'll have nothing to do with anyone that tries to justify it.


Like your fiancé? Your deal breaker means absolutely nothing until you actually break the deal.
"
If it's really a misunderstood joke then they could talk about it and it'd prbly be fine. 
"Stand him down.

Ask him how, exactly, this is disrespectful? How, specially, does your wedding hurt their feelings? Make him spell it out. In detail.

The reason is, you've rejected their faith. People of faith take rejection of their faith as a personal affront. They are butt-hurt that you don't follow their mythology and are marrying someone who also doesn't follow their mythology. These statements, this act to force you/guilt you into following their mythology is bullying. Your dad's bullying you to conform. Make him admit it."
"&gt; Okay. He probably knows that he looks like a slob but he's too lazy to actually address it,

I wonder if he's actually to lazy or if he's using the clothing as a scapegoat for feelings of insecurity.  i.e. He feels like the people are judging him to harshly and by wearing ratty clothes he can blame it on the clothes (something that he could easily change) rather then himself."
But these are all elaborate workarounds to a problem that should have been fixed at the time. The longer this drags on the harder to fix
"Okay, let's look at this rationally:

- It's been 8 months.  Unless you two did the do in between, she'd likely have already had the kid or would be very very close to popping one out.

- This might be a bit presumptuous, but based on y'all's ages, I'm willing to bet if she were pregnant it would be PLASTERED on her Facebook.  (Okay, maybe not plastered, but...odds are, she'd have posted at least SOMETHING on social media about it)

- To caveat on the last point: you said she mentioned once trying to ""baby-trap"" you.  Don't you think, if that were the case, she would want to make sure EVERYONE knew you knocked her up, so you would have a harder time proving her wrong?

The most likely answer here: she just got out of a relationship and in a moment of weakness tried to message you.  Realized it was a bad idea and apologized.  Stay strong, don't contact her, and move on!"
"There are some age-gap relationships that work. My mother and her husband are in one now. My mom is 12 years older than her husband (she is almost 66, he is 54, when they married in 1999, he was 37, she was 49).

But to be honest, some of their success stems from their ages when they started - by the time they got serious about one another (35 and 47), they'd both had more than 10 stable years in their careers, they were settled, knew what they wanted in life. They were much more like peers than say a 22 year old and a 34 year old typically are. A relationship like that that sticks out for the long haul is pretty much an anomaly. 

I have several friends that I went to school with that are just now discovering this - they got into relationships with guys 10-15 years older than them when they were in their late teens-early twenties. And 100% of them (a good half dozen at least), are divorced now that they themselves are in their early-mid thirties and finally waking up to how their partner has actually been all these years.

Most age gap relationships... are like /u/Timmetie has been explaining. They're generally not the healthiest."
"You have all the data you need, friend.

Also, you need to edit your post include the fact that several months ago she lied to you and said she had UTI, when she actually had gono, and had you treated for gono as well."
"See, I wouldn't be okay to be asked to leave own home. Although I wouldn't ever be in the situation where I never left the house by myself, and I leave my boyfriend in the garage to tinker by himself all of the time, because we both are introverts and need alone time. But to ask to have the house to yourself seems seems selfish in my mind. Honestly, it sounds like the bigger issue is that she doesn't have (or isn't maintaining) her own social group, not that she should let OP have the house to himself for an hour a week.  

"
"I know you don't want to, but at this point you need to go to your boss and HR.

This woman is clearly unstable and her behaviour is unacceptable both in and outside of the workplace.

Also, stop trying to be nice to her. Stop caring about her feelings. She might be ""sensitive"" but she also definitely banks on you being too nice to call her out on her bullshit. She frankly sounds manipulative as fuck. Say no to her, stop hanging out with her. If she has meltdown or whatever, just walk away or hang up. She's behaving like a small child so you're gonna have to treat her like one; they can't be reasoned with, they just need to be dealt with.

Also, delete her off social media."
"I was gonna facetiously say that maybe he got it from a shibe rescue because someone didn't know how much work they can be and gave it up, but no shibe rescue would let a first dog owner with no clue take one."
"Remind her that her opinion wasn't requested. It's your body and you're free to do as you please with it.

The comment about your beauty and your grandmother's death are just fucking awful though. I'm pretty sure I would say, ""What an awful thing to say"" if she says something along those lines again... Or, if you are comfortable with confrontation, when she says ""Maybe grandma will die"" you can respond with, ""Or maybe you will. Then I wouldn't have to listen to you bitch about my tattoos that have nothing to do with you.""

I'm all for fighting with fire though. When she makes shitty comments, continue to call her out on them.

""Another tattoo???""

""Another comment?!?""

I'm sure you will look great on your wedding day!"
"Look, there are people out there that love overweight/obese partners and I'm not just talking about feeders. If your bf says he's into you, believe him. I'm sure he knows that you're not at a healthy weight, but he's still attracted to you, or just attracted because you are overweight. That's why he doesn't like to say you're fat.

&gt; rather than motivating me to go after something I NEED.

You want to lose the weight for yourself. Don't make yourself dependent on your bf. Look for like-minded people, join the local gym etc. instead.

&gt; There are other issues in the relationship, but that's another post. 

Only three months in? Why are you staying with him?"
"I just wanted to thank you and let you know how your story has inspired me and should not rush into relationship. I recently got out of an abusive relationship and it is definitely not easy. If a man is not treating you the way you want to be treated, you have two choices - stay or go. Your husband is definitely not treating you right and loves you. Get out so you and your son don't suffer, good luck my dear 
"
"Don't worry I wasn't looking for a thank you by any means. But I don't think there is anything anyone here can say that will remedy your situation. It is indeed a complex situation and I understand that you feel attacked somewhat but that's not the intention. However, not being invested like you are in the situation it is easier to see things where you may have blinders on."
Fun fact: Both people in a sexual relationship are responsible for preventing diseases and pregnancy.
That's even more of a reason for her to not return them though. It's the cheapest pair of $200 leggings she'll ever get.

"He sounds like my ex. We had a similar conversation after one year and he hadn't said 'I love you'....I brought it up and he couldn't really answer and basically had a panic attack.

Continued to date him for years (he was my first long-term relationship so I had no frame of reference for whether this was normal). We rarely fought and everything was cool, but it was almost like being friends with benefits because we didn't connect on an emotional level.

At the 8 year mark he started becoming even more distant. Again I had to be the one to bring it up (otherwise I literally think this could have carried on for 8 more years), and then he said he wanted some space, then a week later we broke up (oh yeah, he did this over Facebook).

Things I realized after we broke up that might apply to your situation:

1. He was emotionally stunted and a coward. It's not too much to expect your partner to be open and honest with you. It's not fun for either party to have those conversations, but sometimes you need to suck it up if it's important.

2. It was remarkably easy to get over him because despite the length of time we were together, I couldn't really fall completely in love as he was always holding back

3. To be completely honest, what I missed most following the breakup was having a boyfriend in general - someone to bring to come with me to social/family events 

I ended up meeting someone new a month after we broke up and the difference is like night and day. I think I used to feel guilty for wanting more and my current BF helped me get over that by making it clear he was equally excited to take our relationship forward. 

I think there's a danger in being complacent with your current situation and you are right to feel alarmed by this conversation. He wants to keep things status quo because it's easy for him, but if you don't face this now you might end up wasting a lot of your time with someone who isn't giving you what you deserve.

Feel free to message me if you like, this sounds eerily familiar."
"It sounds like she has given him a specific amount of time she'd like to have space. I think that's reasonable, but I also see how that'd be frustrating. I think the death of a loved one would be justification for me. "

It's completely disrespectful to her best friend to keep it a secret that OP once fucked her boyfriend. 
A 14yr old girl is texting you secrets and wanting advice. Yeah....for your own good you should shut that down.
Autism was the first thing that sprang to mind. 
"^This. Also to the OP,

I'm no professional, but I agree with r/gonzosaur also. Keep in mind, if you're courageous to ask strangers from around the world, you should also be courageous to tell/ask the person the same. Of course it's easier said than done though. Good luck indeed!"
"This all sucks. My dad has, I think, changed her diapers before. And now I have to tell her my house is off limits. "
"Oh NOES they broke up!!!!!!! That isn't ""forcing.""

Forcing is locking her out, destroying her things, etc.

She said ""hey this is uncomfortable, I am going to move out.""  You sound like a nut if you think that is ""forced."" That is a choice. She needs to break the contract she signed on her own."
"OP is 5'5"" and was 108 lbs, and lost 20 pounds over the course of a few months. 88 lbs is an unhealthy weight for her, and losing weight that quickly is absolutely cause for concern."
Beat case scenario he's been trying to fuck her the entire time. Worst case scenario he has had one nights stands with her and wants more of them.
"A lot of people are attacking you here and I disagree with that: giving up something you love is difficult, even if you know it's the rational thing to do. Sure, you could die doing any number of other things, but as several others have pointed out, you already came close to dying on a motorcycle and your family's anxiety is now through the roof because they know they can't trust other drivers on the road to keep you safe. 
  
My bro rode motorcycles for about 18 years. He stopped riding when his son was born and when I asked him why, he replied, ""Because it matters now whether I live or die."" He's a surgeon who tries to put injured people back together, and he's seen far too many people permanently injured or dead from motorcycle accidents to risk it anymore.

"So what exactly are you asking?

This is a friend you need to cut out of your life for the sake of your marriage. Is she married? Talk to her husband. What the actual fuck?! She she trying to destroy your marriage. 

Ctrl + Del her from your life ASAP. "
We're talking about a college frat here. This is like the definition of immature.
"To be honest it sounds more like a recruitment campaign than anything else.

Overreacting... I certainly wouldn't be comfortable if I were in your shoes either, and it's not like you're throwing a tantrum and demanding she take it down - you're just embarrassed, for yourself and probably a bit for her because it's so over the top.

Is she usually like this or is this something new?"
"Lol what nuance? She's sleeping with a guy who had a long term girlfriend, she even acknowledged it as cheating. There is no nuance. Dude was cheating on his gf and OP did a solid by doing what the bf and OP's friend wouldn't do (confess). 

This is also why you don't get involved with people at your workplace (which is a fairly common sense lesson). "
"I had something similar happen, but we didn't hookup.

I went on an okcupid date with a guy, and it was nothing special. We didn't so much as hold hands. I vaguely remembered that he was the manager of a restaurant, but I didn't care to remember which one. No chemistry, and we never spoke after the date.

I then met my current SO about a month later, and it never clicked in my head that he and the other guy were from the same town. 

Well, I kept dating my SO and grew quite fond of him (obviously), and on our like 5th date he took me to a restaurant that ""his friend"" was a manager at. I thank god in hindsight that his friend wasn't there that night, because turns out that (surprise, surprise) it was the guy I went out with a few weeks earlier! Would've been awkward.

It took a long time before I realized that the friend was the guy I went out with. I told my SO as soon as I realized because I didn't want it to come out later, and for it to seem as though I was hiding something. 

My boyfriend felt really awkward about it, and ultimately stopped being friends with the guy. We never went to that restaurant again (a shame because the food was yummy). Now my SO and I have been together for almost 3 years and we moved to a new city together, and I'm not sure whether my boyfriend ever thinks of the friend, but we never talk about him. 

If my boyfriend felt this awkward about a simple date that went absolutely nowhere, I can only imagine if I'd hooked up with the guy! "
"Your brother doesn't ""hate gay people"". He's trying to sort out a very difficult thing for a little boy: the breakup of his family primarily, but perhaps also he's picking up some of the social stigma of being gay.

Seven year olds see the world as very black and white.  It's developmentally appropriate. When a bad thing happens, there must be a bad guy who caused it.  Some kids make the bad guy themselves which is tragic.  It sounds like your brother is making your dad or his boyfriend the bad guy.  It's his way of making a very confusing situation fit into his child world view. 

Others' suggestions of talking to your parents and encouraging them to get him some outside support.  In the meantime, I wouldn't worry that your brother has turned into a raving homophobe.  With help, time, and consistent, loving presence of both his parents, he'll work through this phase.  "
I'd argue that you actually have some really messed up sexist ideas about dating and maybe aren't ready for it yet. If you think the only reasons women are interested in men are looks or money then you have some personal growth to do before dating anyone at all. 
"Nah. No second chance. You have a daughter to protect and think about, too. There were multiple messages, on days you were spending together? Screw that. 

Also...""being drunk"" is not an excuse. I'm sure he was lying anyway, but when people do bad things while drunk, it doesn't not excuse them for poor behavior. "
"I was starting to type that I've been around the block a time or two but I've never forgotten a one night stand. It's been about 10 years for me since those days.

Then I thought about it and while I'm pretty sure I could remember them all there's no way I would be able name them all. 

There's even less of a chance that I could track them down, even through facebook. 

Now that I think of it I am less confident that I could even remember them all. Fuckin' ""time"", eh?

Verdict: Entirely plausible!"
"Cheating like this will likely destroy her family.  The husband, the kids, the in-laws, etc.  They've been married 16 years so I'd imagine their lives and families are quite intertwined."
"Where did you read that they constantly have arguments? Also, if they did, then he should want to fix it in counseling. But he doesn't want to fix it. So I think it's an excuse. "
"Yeah, don't move in together yet either. Don't even think about cohabitation until you've been with someone for at least a year. Preferably longer. Living with someone changes EVERYTHING. And this guy sounds really extraordinarily immature and controlling. "
"His mom is dying. It makes completely sense that she should be involved in this. Not budging on having your dying mother there is completely understandable. 

They worked together and found a compromise, like they are supposed to do. "
How was this going to play out if you hadn't found those texts? He was about to cheat. He cheats. Not sure why you would trust him? 
"Thank you for understanding! I see a lot of comments suggesting I kick her out, and I appreciate that they're looking out for me and my nuclear family, but I couldn't imagine just sending her out to be poor and live in squalor. She's a wonderful, kind, generous person, and I don't actually mind her in my basement very much. I'm just concerned about financial planning for the future, and her making bad work/financial decisions. 

I really liked the advice PP left about acting like the parent and just laying out what's GOING to happen, and not giving her any choice in the matter. If she wants to act like the child, I'll treat her like one of my kids. "
"and don't neglect to also take care of yourself! best of luck, you two sound wonderful and extremely lucky to have found support in one another. "
I just hope his girlfriend has red hair too... 
"??? 40-50 lbs is a big change even if she was 6 ft which seems unlikely. Even if she is average height like 5'5"" or something, that's a big change. Couple that with unattractive eating/exercise/health habits and that is a totally different person. 

And it's ridiculous to not expect someone to put on many pounds of weight? Yes, fluctuations in body are natural, but she is living a lifestyle that encourages the changes to her body. I'd never shame anyone for being overweight or obese, but such drastic changes can have negative outcomes. "
"This is a really good way to put it, thank you. One of your points is I think my main concern... I understand I'm only 26 but I don't want to ""waste"" a few years only to find out that his habits aren't going to change and I need to move on. 

I suppose I could just be his ""partner"" for life and never actually marry him. But that's not how I prefer to operate. "

"You need to call the police. 

I know it feels confusing, but there is nothing to be conflicted about.

"I think you should be honest with your fiancee and figure out what to do together. I'm sorry that things turned out this way. I think your parents are being supremely unfair, and will die one day, and you'll be left with regret if you do what they want of you. 

Same for your sisters, one day, your parents won't be around. It's not worth them taking their illogical side against you when they supported your relationship the whole way through. 

I hope things can work out for the best, though."
"Agreed, after this comment OP, I don't like Jesse either.

And you're not painting him in a bad light either persay, I can see you're vouching for him. You're just saying things that are CLEARLY his opinions making you insecure.

NOT OK. NOT OK EVER.

Anyone with that kind of mindset on opposite sex relationships is straight-up IGNORANT or they themselves aren't trustworthy with the opposite sex and don't trust others, which is just as bad if not worse."
"I understand your frustration. I've always thought it to be rude when people you are in the company of choose to speak in a language they know you don't understand. However, they are in their home, in a very relaxed setting with family, so it's probably easier for them to slip into the language they are more comfortable with.  If you want to feel included, you could at least attempt to learn the language. They could see that you are making an effort and truly want to engage with them. Another alternative would be to strike up more conversations with them in English just to show that you don't want to just sit there idly, and genuinely want to talk to them. "
Damn.  So glad you are out. 
I have. I've started really trying to pay attention to body language. He sometimes translates but sometimes I try to figure it out myself. The more they see an effort they try to offer explanations and translations but sometimes it's like stepping into another world. I've just taken it upon myself to try to figure it out.  That's the best advice I can give to you especially if you are visiting in their home. Express an interest to understand not just to him but to his family as well. Keep your end of communication open. 
"Tbh I'd be pretty annoyed if I'd organised something and my gf ditched me after regardless of what she was ditching me to do.

"Regarding your final sentence: she may feel like she has no chance of competing with other women in the attractiveness department.


This isn't true, and combined with the fact she's not working and (probably) doesn't have much to do all day makes me think one thing: she's in a rut. 


People need things to do to stay grounded. Hobbies, obsessions, friends, things that they derive accomplishment and pleasure from. This doesn't have to be a job. 


Your reduction in attraction may be multifaceted. The solution should benefit her first and you a close second. I'd think hard about what she might like, and then take a great vacation somewhere that she will find beautiful and awe inspiring and joyful. Then, talk about life and what you both want out of it. Sometimes getting out of the place and talking about things can help pull ya outta the rut.


Kid gloves with this situation good sir, she deserves your best shot. "

"Shibas are independent and a hard breed to train - they listen to maybe a handful of people and that's it. Theoretically. (I believe any dogs can be trained to a certain extent, even the crazies). 

With that said - get out of there. He has shown you so much proof that he is irresponsible and undeserving of you. Who drives with a dog on their lap? Small or medium they DO NOT BELONG THERE. If anything happens, it's their life (and your face if/when airbags pop).  Nipping for attention, growling because they can't have it their way - holy hell, get that dog some training.

"It's just an idea, really. But I can explain my reasoning more if you'd like. Let's say you two make, for simplicity's sake, $1,000 together. You make $700 a month and she makes $300 a month. Now let's say you go on a date that costs $100. You would pay $70 (70% of your combined income) of that and she would pay $30. (30% of your combined income.)

Not only are you not footing *all* of the bills, but you're splitting it in a way that would make it even on both sides. In this case, you're both paying 10% of your income. (Not that you'd ever go on a date that cost 10% of your monthly income...That's just an example.)

You can't plead with them or use your love as some sort of catalyst. Please think of your safety as well as your child. 

Would you want your baby to treat any woman like the way you're being treated? No, because it's abuse. Now imagine you stay and you have a daughter together. Would you let him  treat her like he treats you? Would you let ANY man treat her that way? Why are you different? 

Maybe you could talk to your MIL and see if she can help you, or reach out to your family. I know it's hard to leave, but you need to. Do not, and I repeat, DO NOT stay together because of your child. Growing up in a home where you see your parents fight or one parent constantly belittle the other really messes you up. Please be safe and look into options on shelters if you can't find  any other way out. "
She's being incredibly rude and self-righteous.  It's not something that should be brushed under the rug.
"This is awful advice. He is deliberately belittling and awful, and therapy is *not* recommended for abusive relationships - it only gives the abuser more tools to control their partner with. "
Where the fuck are you from because I never want to go there.
"This is true. Perhaps try phrasing it in terms of daily necessities. You only have 23k, you're near the poverty line, and that money could pay for three weeks of the food you need to survive, or for such and such a bill for a month, and you're already deep in debt. You don't need to fall further behind. "

"Literally all of this is in the past. I don't mean that in a cruel way, I mean that you should be able to say something about your partner that makes you happy _now_. You shouldn't be forcing yourself to live this miserable, controlled, restricted life for a guy who doesn't even try for you.

I know it seems bad to say, but _a person can be disabled and still be a bad person_. The fact that he's blind doesn't mean he's magically not controlling, or rude, or dismissive, or overly dependant, or unwilling to help, or completely uncaring about your needs and desires. It genuinely doesn't even seem like he cares about you other than the stuff you do for him. When was the last time he actively did something just to make you smile?"
"So then what's wrong with OP's gf taking her parents money? There doesn't seem to be any strings attached, just ""here, free money""."
"That cam girl has the same kinks as every man that throws money at her.

Any man browsing cam sites, who thinks throwing money at the girls makes him special, is every cam girls dream. 

She wasn't upset you were viewing other girls, she was upset you would find another to toss your dollars at."
"Yeah, some hard boundaries need to be set. There is a festival we all want to attend in April and she kept saying ""OP! You need to by tickets for us NOW otherwise they'll all be gone."" so I did and told her the cost but she's all ""I'll pay you when I get the funds okay? :) "" But now I'm realizing I'm being played for a sucker, she's not going to pay me back for those tickets (if she does it's not anytime soon/ she's hoping I forget). Whereas what I SHOULD have done was bought husband and mine's tickets and let her figure hers out on her own."
"&gt; He's not very motivated, **but I'm holding out hope that this can change**.

Don't ever do that. My only advice for you is to never expect or hope that someone will change who they are as a person. You either take all of their pros and cons or you don't. "
"Maybe try and point him towards peer tutoring offered through the school? I would also let him know that you have your own work to worry about as well, so you can't afford to spend all of your time assisting him. Of course you can still do things like proof-read and stuff like that, but ask that he at least have a draft for you to help with. No starting from 0 words and depending on you for ideas. 

I'm not sure how to approach this in a gentle way, so you may have to hurt his feelings and give some ""tough love""."

"&gt;My boyfriend is jealous of my brother and he keeps making these really stupid comments and remarks about the role and I'm starting to have enough of it.

Congratulations and good wishes to your teenage brother.

Sorry for you on your toddler boyfriend. I'd have enough of his stupidity too. A man child is so not sexy."
"If I were you, I would. I wouldn't be gambling my future home ownership on someone's distaste for inconvenience. 2-bed and rent out a room is a great plan. Gets you on the ladder and provides some income. 

I'm on the other side of the world but I have friends and family in Sydney; so I know it's a whole new level of insane. I thought London was bad! Don't wait on him to buy or you're right, you will miss the boat and you'll end up hours from your own family for the sake of being minutes closer to his. What a prize.

Take legal advice on the de facto partnership aspect too, I don't know if NSW in particular gives protections equivalent to marriage to those but I know some Aus states do. Look out for yourself. "
He sounds immature and misogynistic. Almost like the kind of 23yo man who would date a 17yo...oh wait....
"If she's really forgotten how to boil water that's pretty much a very serious medical issue. She needs to go to the doctor pronto.  If she's just lying, she needs some psychological help. How long has she been this way?"
"&gt; He doesn't seem to show any remorse or feeling of wrongdoing about his actions

When someone cheats in a relationship and the other partner (you) is willing to try and salvage it, perhaps the most important thing that the cheater (him) needs to do is make a full, sincere, heartfelt apology. To come clean on their own (strike one, since his brother told you, meaning you may have never found out). To admit their mistake fully and beg forgiveness (strike two). To show that it was a one-time thing (strike three, it wasn't they fucked many times drunk and sober, no excuses).

&gt;He seems to feel bad about cheating on me

Good lord. He SEEMS to feel bad??? He should SEEM to feel bad if he forgot the take the fucking trash out. He should be making the repentant apology of a fucking lifetime right now.

He has no respect for his family, you, or your relationship. 

&gt;deep down I'm hoping she'll go back home and he'll realize how sick this is and we can forget it and move on. 

Do you see how twisted that thinking is? You think the problem will go away if she does? Your bf will still be the same cheating ass that he was before. You'll never forget this indiscretion, and you certainly won't be able to reconcile and move on when he barely seems to feel bad about it. What happens ten years down the line when you're married and his brother isn't there to catch him cheating? Do you think he'll tell you? Doubt it.

"Lol I'm female, but I see where you're coming from.
Tbh he and I had a strained relationship for some time. My older sister was closer to him than I; I more so with my mum (as I'm sure my comment infers).
His current wife is Ukrainian, he met her online roughly 5 years ago now and I witnessed him outright try to lie to his sister (my Aunt, who happens to be a very bright woman) that he'd known Mila ""for years, and travelled to see her in 2008."" ..my Aunt had none of it, ""Rob, you didn't go anywhere in 2008.""
To put more perspective on this, he moved Mila here in late summer 2011 and dropped the wedding on my sister and I with 4 days notice. Expecting us to turn up.
It's all kinds of messed up, I don't even know where to begin with that mess.
However, I appreciate yours and OP's opportunity to help me vent it out. Very few people know this history, I haven't talked it out much."
"*If* his argument had been ""I looked at place and the only places we can get lower your commute by 10 minutes while increasing mine by half an hour so let's rethink our strategy"" that would be different.

But that's not what's happening here. He doesn't even want to look, because he doesn't want to commute any further than his 5 minutes."
"It's like....yeah, you probably *could* muddle through stressing yourself out every day, or you could go to therapy, solve the underlying issue, and live without that stress every day.

If you can solve the issue and remove that stress from your life, even if you could survive without solving it, why wouldn't you?"
"This same question gets posed all the time. ""I love this guy, but I want to go explore before settling down"". You have to understand that this will not work. I'm sorry, it won't. Time and time again. 

You have to see it from his perspective. You're telling him he's not good enough. You're telling him he's not enough for you. Do you have any idea how soul crushing that is? Even if a year later you come back and say ""oh well I had my fun, and I realized that it's not all it's cracked up to be, I got it out of my system, I want to be with you now forever"", its already too late. You've already created deep deep seeded feelings of inadequacy. Guys don't get over that so easily, if ever. Most can't. 

Not telling you what to do, but you can't have both. You must choose. It's hugely disrespectful to expect him to wait for you. There's no compromise here.

You may regret not going out to explore your sexuality, but you may also regret throwing away your perfect forever partner just to cum a bit harder a few more times."
"I know you don't want to believe it but, she did it on purpose. Telling you are ungrateful because she was trying too clean your clothes is manipulative behavior. She could have apologized for the destruction.

I would go and ask in r/raisedbynarcissists, too. It's a common behavior to see parents destroying childrens property and telling them it was because they loved and cared about them."
This is really the only answer. Accuse her of borrowing it.

"You don't try not to be a disgusting human trainwreck cheating cliche.  You make the choice to not be a disgusting cliche and you just don't do it. 

Or you know, you could just accept you are a completely unethical, degraded cliche of the other woman and go with it.  That always works out so well. I'm sure he'll leave his wife and kids for you.  "
"You realise your sperm gets worse with age too, yeah? "
"Your son LOVES you, and what do you want when you love someone? Not to watch their soul be crushed repeatedly by someone emotionally abusing them. He may be way too young to articulate anything close to this now, but I guarantee you... the older child/teen/adult that he will one day be will feel that way. He loves you and he will want the world for you, and for you to be treated well.

"
"I feel so weird admitting this, but I can smell death on people. When someone is terminally ill, they get this sickly sweet aroma and it's so distinctive and universal that I can recognise it on strangers. It's not a regular thing, but when it happens it's...upsetting. I once smelled it on a colleague and knew she was in the first stages of dying (it was a faint smell). She was diagnosed with cancer a week later, died within the month. Another time I walked into a hospital room an hour after someone had passed away and the smell was overwhelming. This sweet, cloying, sweet yet sickening smell...it lingered on me all day. "
"&gt;Once I leave, my son would hardly see his dad

That's sad, but not your fault. If he cares about his son, he will do everything in his power to keep up contact. If not... Why stay? You can't keep living your life bending over backwards to facilitate your son's relationship with his father. Your husband is an adult, he can figure it out on his own."
"Two things.

1) Most clothes off the rack don't fit anybody right, anywhere from A cup to DDD cups. Find stuff that makes you look good, don't worry about whether or not you make them look good.

2) The ex- who cared more about cup size than who you are deserves all the shitty relationships he's gonna have. He's an idiot. Go relax and have fun with the guy you're interested in and get to know him, don't just fixate on his awesome abs. :)"
"If she's not willing to go to therapy, then she isn't willing to change. 
Your mistake was marrying an irrational woman. 
You don't need to feel any guilt any longer. You spend far greater amounts of time than most with their families. You make a good living and she new from the beginning your life. 
Time for an ultimatum of therapy or divorce. You both either talk it out rationally or it's done. 
If you do nothing. You just feel terrible constantly from all her complaining.  Life's too short.  
"
"What a cowardly piece of shit.  It doesn't feel like it right now, but this was the luckiest day of your life.  A cannonball just whiffed by your head.  Grieve, donate or sell the dress and consider the money lost an asshole tax.  I started to recommend that you sue him in small claims court for half the cost, but on second thought you are better off never, ever contacting him again.  Block him everywhere and move on to live an awesome life.  He would have dragged you down into mud where he lives. "

But making a creepy, unnecessary snark about your breasts and puberty, and shaming women because they don't meet his personal expectations about how they should dress is jerk material.

You look fine. We want what we can't have and it's normal to feel off when we compare ourselves to others, but don't feel like you look any less good because of this guy. Want to know a secret? Tons and tons of men say that small breasts are one of their favorite ""imperfections"" on a woman (in addition to freckles, big noses, and gapped teeth). There is no shortage of men who will like you exactly how you look and won't feel the need to cast their unwarranted opinions on other women."

Wow, she sounds totally insufferable. If only she would listen to people who are trying to help her, unlike you, who *totally* hasn't shit on every bit of advice offered.

It's still all about you. What are you doing to make yourself better for others?

"She didn't say she didn't want to marry him, though. She said she had (at 21 years of age) no plans to marry him. That is to say, she was not planning on marriage in the foreseeable future, that it just hadn't become an option yet. I think it's a bit different from him announcing he wouldn't marry her (ever), with the ever being implied. I don't think it's clear if he meant ""never"" or ""for now"", but i agree about how embarrassing it is for OP either way. "
"OP, I'm somewhat around your age. I'd more than likely not be romantically interested in a 29 year old man that refuses to move out of his mother's house.

"&gt;Now, I know a lot of you guys wouldn't have nothing against situations like that, hell, you would even encourage it.

Actually, I think almost everyone would *not* encourage you two to have a threesome. You obviously aren't comfortable with it, and while she has ""nothing against it,"" it's not like she's pushing the idea. It was a hypothetical situation, not a planned future event. However, you seem to be acting like it's the latter, not the former. Keep things in perspective.

&gt;So maybe there is something there and she feels I am not enough for her. Well, at least in sexual terms.

Please don't take this as a personal attack, but I think your reaction to this hypothetical situation says a lot more about your own issues and insecurities than it does about your girlfriend's sexual satisfaction. From what you've posted, nothing from your girlfriend's responses says she wants to have a threesome, is dissatisfied with you, or doesn't care about you. You are the one who seems to be hung up on this and making a mountain out of a molehill."
"It's always funny when I see people say they are traditional Chinese but pick and choose what they want to be traditional about. Is her family dad makes all the money and the mom stays at home and cook and clean? 

What does she say about the dowry that she will bring to the marriage which is also a big old Chinese tradition along with buying the bride. That's just as expensive as the buying of the bride, so is she going to have 35k-40k of jewelry and other valuables to match?

The buying of the bride should be basically a gesture of good will and tradition and not huge sums of money. They seems to be digging for gold here."

"Just to add on, bmi of less than 17.5 is considered a factor in diagnosing anorexia. And eating disorders are not all about body issues...I struggle with disordered eating based around a serious lack of appetite. It doesn't make dropping 20 lbs any less stressful on your body or any less dangerous for your health just because it's not something that you're doing consciously. I am a thinly framed person who has to work really hard to eat enough in a day, and like me you need to take this seriously and recognized that what you're experiencing is unhealthy, concerning, and totally worth concern from your loved ones.

 It might feel normal to you, but in all likelihood if you get some help and look back on this later you'll be shocked about how far you let it go. At least, that's my experience. I look back at pics from my undergrad, and I'm shocked. You know what else? It also makes me sad no one tried to intervene. I couldn't see it and sometimes it bothers me no one took me aside and tried to tell me I was getting too thin. 

Finally, eating meals in a healthy way is likely to help your mental health. Your food matters, how you eat can definitely affect your mood. Eating ""right"" (whatever that means to you) won't cure your depression, but it will help. "

Eh.. I think helping them is a nice thing to do, but without question is a bit much. They are likely living beyond their means, so asking how they are going to cut expenses is very reasonable."
"Ok you never told him you were insecure about it as far as I know, what you said was:
""I'm going to start having more sex. You decide if it's going to be with you.""
Basically saying that if he doesn't step up that you will have sex with someone else. YOU said that, YOU made it a possibility. That doesn't sound like your insecure, sounds like your confident af tbh, to just throw it out there that your willing to have sex with other people. He made a joke about it, albiet in bad taste, but it was just a joke. 

But sure, you didn't like it and want him to comfort you, that is totally reasonable! So he says...
""Oh, you know I was joking, I didn't think you'd take it that way, of course I don't want either of us to sleep with other people."" 

He understands exactly why you are hurt, so he explains that he didn't mean it and that he doesn't want that and it was just a bad joke and didn't realize you would receive it so badly, and I think he realizes and wont do it again. If he didn't understand why you were hurt, his response would be more like ""it was just a joke relax"", but he didn't.Btw you were the first one to mention having sex with other people if he didn't - you don't think that was hurtful?

""And then he'll just .. go about the rest of his evening, having decided that since he's explained why it wasn't hurtful, I shouldn't be hurt."" - He didn't decide you shouldn't be hurt, he explained why he said what he said and that he didn't mean it...what else should he do? What do you want him to do instead of going about his evening? Whatever it is...why don't you just tell him what you want?

Im not saying what he said was ok, I think he should make sure he doesn't say something like that again, and give you a sincere apology for hurting your feelings (on purpose or not). But it does seem like your being ridiculously dramatic about one joke that he didn't even mean (whereas when you said your comment about having sex with other people - YOU MEANT IT).

You are definitely overreacting here."

"Honestly, I've never considered cold sores to be that big of a deal. Yes, they suck, but the folks over at WebMD estimate at least 70 something percent of Americans have HSV-1 and that includes children, so it's not like it's some taboo, sexual thing. 

I get one occasionally during ski season when my lips are sun and wind burned (seems to trigger them) and my version of ""coming out"" to my SO (now husband) was ""I wouldn't kiss me for a couple of days, I think I'm getting a cold sore."" He said, ""damn, that sucks"" and we kept skiing.

"I don't think those two loves are mutually exclusive. You don't love a partner like you love a friend - its different. Same as how a parent loves their kid different to how they love their partner.  I don't necessarily think love is a finite thing. 

I mean, when you get married and then you have a kid do you love your partner less because you now have a kid cos it's all transferred to the kid. Or do you love them both differently? 
The same could be said for friends and siblings or whatever. Not everything in life fits into neat little boxes."

"First of all, what you're feeling is okay. Every emotion you'll ever feel is okay; how you *act* on it is what defines you. 

Monogamy, like all things related to intimacy, is on a bunch of spectrums. Like a gradient. On one end of the gradient, you get people who only ever want one partner. When they're in love, the rest of the world seems to vanish for them. Closer to the middle, there are people who enjoy looking at others when they've got a partner, and who are happy to just leave it at that. Further on, you've got people who actively desire to get intimate with others; at the far end, you've got people who aren't even interested in monogamy, and whose love for their partners increases their desire for others. This stuff can change in any direction over time, as you gain new experiences and grow older. And all of that is cool! *You* get to decide how to express your feelings, and *you* — not your culture — get to figure out what your relationships look like. 

You say that you have the desire to cheat, but do you really crave that betrayal? Or do you actually just desire to be with multiple people, with the happy consent of everyone involved? Because if it's the latter, that wouldn't be cheating at all, just a good ol' fashioned open relationship. 

If you're interested in an open relationship, it's something you can talk about with your partner. Maybe you'd be interested in role-play, where you and your partner pretend to be strangers who hook up. Maybe you'd like to have sex involving other people. Maybe you want multiple romantic relationships — that's called ""polyamory"" — in which case reading the website ""morethantwo"" together can be a great first step. 

Or maybe you just want to enjoy those butterfly feelings, and leave it at that. That's fine too. 

Your culture has told you that if you're with someone, you won't ever have feelings for other people. But that's not what reality is like. It's only true for some people. The rest of us can get all sorts of desires, and it's up to you and your partner to find a way to make that work, with honesty and sweet communication. 

Good luck. PM me if you'd like some links. :)"
"Ive been in a similar situation.  My ex was from latin america and her mum was super pushy and critical,  scolding me for being laid back and not "" manly enough"". She came to stay...first thing my ex said was "" mum dont mess this up for me"". It was a week from hell...our relationship suffered and we broke up probably 2 weeks after. Id let her stay somewhere nearby or get your hubby to stay at a friends for a  bit. Definitely dont let her stay a month "
"My mother used to be in an abusive relationship. She worked hard to provide for us kids and she was always faithful. This abusive boyfriend would accuse her of the most asinine things and he'd steal her precious sleep while they argued. She would defend herself and eventually admit to doing something she never once did. Why? 
Because she had to prove she wasn't who this man was accusing her of being. 

You should NEVER have to defend your innocence. Leave him. Now. "
"Same. People get in one fight and it's ""TEXTBOOK ABUSE - BREAK UP NOW"" lol. But agreed with this situation. The f*ck is her boyfriend's problem?!"
"You have the right to be upset, OP. Don't ever let anyone tell you that you aren't allowed to feel certain emotions. 

She destroyed your possessions. This wasn't ""accidentally yelling because hormones."" This was a deliberate action, that took time to execute. And then even after, she didn't apologize, she insisted that she was right, and has made no attempts to fix the situation for you. 

You absolutely can be upset at her about this. "
"I'd echo this. I wouldn't know when my friends kids birthdays are, and because I don't have kids, I can't really relate to them about things their kids are up to, just like they can't relate to me talking about what I'm up to in work or nights out. Doesn't mean we don't care about each other, just means our lives are different. 

Like it or not, having kids does change your life. Friends will still be there, but you have to remember that it's not them whose lives have changed, so it can be an adjustment for them to realise yours have, and it can be an adjustment for you to realise that their lives are still going on as before. 

Also, and I don't mean this unkindly, but do you think the fact that you're not working might play some part in this? Even if you're with your kids all day, you're not interacting with adults as often as your friends are and so you probably notice the abscences far more easily. 

Ive also never heard of anyone I know wishing their friends a happy anniversary with their boyfriend. If it crops up as an event on Facebook, someone might comment but that's about it. I know I'd actually be surprised if anyone else remembered my anniversary with my boyfriend. 

Please try not to take this too harshly, but it might be that you're expecting a little too much from your friends. I can't imagine it's easy to be raising three kids, and I know in that situation, I'd probably be feeling a little left out of the life my friends are still living. Friendships change as we get older and as our lives change, so we need to adjust our expectations from friends too. The fact Rachel noticed you were uncontactable probably means she does still care, if you value her as a friend, talk this out with her. "
"I would say ongoing polite, respectful, non-boundary crossing continuous contact with an ex is a green flag! Shows maturity on both of their parts. "

Sweet. Good to know you share the same integrity as Brock Turner's parents
Yes because destroying your children's lives because you're unwilling to communicate to your partner like a responsible adult is the right  decision to make.. /s.  Listen I've been in an abhaive relationship and would never dream of cheating. Two wrongs don't make a right and no amount of unhappiness and selfishness excuses ruining your children's lives 
"Oh, he knows she's 'wiggling her way back in.' He's hanging out with her and encouraging it.

He's already cheating. Don't try to be the 'cool girlfriend' and look the other way. You don't deserve this treatment. If he was being loyal, he wouldn't be shit talking you to his ex and sneaking around with her."
"1. Where did you see six months? Op never mentioned that. 

2. They've been together 2.5 years. Her expressing that she's going to move on if he's not interested in having kids in the next five years is reasonable. She told him she'd want kids in her 30s, this is moving the timeline up 2 years. She never said she's going to leave him, that's something you assumed. 

3. If they're completely incompatible on this, and they're both unwilling to compromise, they should cut it off so they can find partners that have compatible desires. That's not a bad thing, it's a sign of maturity. "
"Personally, I'd have the surgery.

Right now, you're in a horrible situation facing a horrible choice. But I really feel like, eventually, you'll be able to look back and see that going through this shit tunnel led you to a better situation. Not that you'd go through it again, but ... I mean, you deserve a life partner who loves and supports you when you're at the bottom of the barrel, not someone who throws this ultimatum in your face. "
"So he's emotionally abusive? Google emotional abuse and read some of the behaviors associated with it. He's in his 30's now. If he can't have a rational discussion with you now, he's probably never going to start."
"&gt;So I guess what I am asking is what you guys would make of this situation how would you interpret randomly getting these texts?

She's dissatisfied with her current relationship and is emotionally cheating on her boyfriend with you.

Don't date cheaters. Don't get back with exes unless the issues that caused the breakup have been/can be addressed. It's better for a child to have two parents separate and happy than to have two parents together and miserable. "
That's no excuse to not save. You want a bigger fancier house. He doesn't. That means it's on you.
"I don't have any sources for this, but my personal feeling is that it's much more fun (and reassuring) to imagine complex cat-and-mouse games between dogged cops and charismatic clue-leaving genius-devils than to think about the reality, which can involve things like, ""Three women almost rescue a 14-year-old Dahmer victim, but they don't speak English well, the kid's disoriented from having acid injected into his brain, and Dahmer claims to police the kid was his boyfriend -- which the cops don't want to deal with -- so they march the bleeding child back to Dahmer's door. Dahmer strangles and dismembers him shortly after the cops leave."""
Seeing teenagers at Starbucks is pretty common in my area.
"Nah man, I'm of the opinion that people who view pets as disposable are the unreasonable arseholes. 

I also think how people treat animals is a really good indicator of how they treat kids. She sounds like she'd be the kind of person who'd date someone with children and then expect the children to be pushed out as well. Sounds far-fetched, but it sadly isn't. "
He invalidated your feelings as part of an attempt to manipulate you into behaving how he wants. He fucked up. 
"My parents were the same. I didn't want to do university, but they sent me off anyways. They didn't want me living with my bf, but I did everything I could to anyways. 

Sure. I was angry. But I *understood why* they did that. Do you really not see it, OP?

Like it or not, university is now pretty essential for jobs. And BFs are very likely to come and go, but education can have a 'forever' impact. And relationships can often distract from really important things. BTW, when my bf and I broke up, I failed a class. Soooo, it's not like my parents concerns were unfounded. What I'm trying to say is your mom is just trying to set you up for success, try to understand that. 

Anyways... to the point 

My first year of university, my bf and I did long distance. Second year of university, we had our dorm rooms next door to each other. The third year we moved into an apt together, because by that point our parents accepted the relationship. In other words, it took time to convince my parents because we were young and still needed their financial help. 

So OP. I'm assuming your mom is paying rent? Instead of fighting her, move into the same apt complex as your bf. You'll sleep over all the time anyways and you'll be close. Try to be neighbors. Then when you're not a teen, move in together. "
"When I bartended, we counted a bottle as five glasses. "
"Came here to read some 'she knew she had them and could have been better/faster about treatment and accidentally carried some on her clothes' type story. Which, having lived in NY, is nearly unforgivable in and of itself because GOD DAMN bedbugs are the worst.

This, however... **RUN, FORREST, RUN**. I am literally waiting for the 'accidental' pregnancy update. "
"Yeah, I had one of those, too.  When I first moved him in one of my cats hated him so much that she moved out.  She just found herself another family.  I'd occasionally catch her sitting by the back door looking in, but when she realized I had seen her she'd split.  I should've listened to the fucking cat.  That guy ended up abusing both me and my other cats.  He was awful.

OP should run."
"Ew, don't let this person dictate how you think of girls and dating.
Don't look at girlfriends as ""trading up"". That's such an unhealthy way to look at women."
"What's your hesitation about going to counseling by yourself? It seems to me like that's a reasonable olive branch towards fixing your marriage, no? You go to therapy for a while, and talk to your husband about what you're talking about *in* therapy, and then try to get him to come with you after a while if your therapist thinks that would be a good idea."
"Dude, I read thru all the comments, and you're coming off like every idea people are giving you is dumb. ""Well of course I thought of that, dumbass. It's just not possible/practical because..."" 

I mean, you like reading. Ok. Me too. What kind of books? Maybe we like the same authors or genres or maybe we hate the same authors or genres. And then maybe we have more in common. What? I have rich parents too! 

Also, there is no need to limit yourself because of your ""serious"" course of study. My dad has an undergraduate degree in economics...and he loves art. All kinds of art. Believe it or not, there are people like that who exist. 

You just gotta come down off your pedestal to meet them. "

"&gt; (I swear to God, these guys all have the same shitty playbook)

I see this a lot. After an abusive and violent relationship, I started to wonder why they all looked the same on the forums I was using. They had such similar timelines, behaviors, even words used and the same types of physical abuse. Then I realized, its not so much a physical playbook as it is its just what works. Its a ""best practices"" kinda thing. Standard Operating Procedures. I dont know if they go looking for this stuff, or know it from trial and error or some instinct in getting what they want or evaluating the situation. People have different skill sets and someone that desires to abuse, control, and manipulate you instinctively may know what to look for sometimes. "
"My friend's daughter passed away in the womb shortly before birth.  She had to go through induced labor, hold a child that would never breathe.  She came home to a house with a set up nursery that the baby would never sleep in.  I did not and still cannot understand what she went through or what would actually comfort her.

On her daughter's first birthday, I was sweating.  I took a chance and sent my friend some flowers to put into a garden memorial that she had made in honor of her daughter.  I was afraid I was opening up a wound.  And that it was the wrong move.  But, it turns out that it was right.  My friend told me that somebody recognizing that her daughter is a person, with a birthday, meant so much to her.

So if you feel an urge to do something this special for your friend, please do it.  Silence breaks hearts.  Recognition of loss brings meaning.  She will treasure this gift, even if you wait awhile to give it to her."
"You're subtly modifying the situation by saying ""they don't hang out all the time"". He says ""they never hang out"". The former and the latter have vastly different implications. If OP is telling the truth and they really never even make time to hang out at *all*, I'm not sure said ex can reasonably play the ""don't date my ex"" card after five years. If someone who won't even get coffee with me tried to pull that one on me after half a decade, I'm sorry but I would laugh. 

By all means, if the friend doesn't want to do it, then that's that. But come on, the social rule doesn't really apply here. "
"Age and marital status do affect the likelihood of exacerbated contradictory feelings and thoughts. It doesn't mean a teenager has less of a right to feel some type of way, but I can attest that knowing that the community/your family would accept one outcome over another (for example) can weigh on your decision quite heavily."
"Commercial genealogical DNA tests can't distinguish well between genetically similar populations, but they can tell the difference between Eastern European and Middle Eastern. That one is really clear-cut. 23andme is actually the most reliable admixture estimate of the three major companies on the market. Also, if her bio dad is half Palestinian, then the estimate makes complete sense.

OP - if you have any doubt, look at your DNA matches. If you are indeed Palestinian, some of your DNA relatives will be, too. That's one big clue.

"""Sorry, I can't help.""

And if I were you, I would keep yours and your girlfriend's money separate. "
That makes zero sense. I mean. I meet with the same attractive people every week. They're coworkers and bosses. Should my SO be threatened? 
"&gt;Look at this from the wife's perspective. From the perspective who has never met this person and never attended a session with this person.

I'm sorry but I have to disagree with you here. I've been seeing my psychologist for almost 7 years now, more than half as long as I've been married. I see a woman and I happen to be bisexual. My husband has never met my psych aside from them seeing each other the one time he took my to an appointment. They have literally no interaction, he's never been to a session with me.

And I really don't think you understand how insanely difficult it is to find a psychologist/therapist who both clicks with you and can provide the kind of therapy that you need. I went through 4 before I found my current psych.

It doesn't matter that you can see why an insecure person would act this way. It's on her to fix that, not him, not his psych."
"I know it really sucks, but if you don't tell them the truth about your feelings they're going to put a lot of blame on your soon to be husband. They love you, so you telling them you don't want a church wedding because you're not religious will be upsetting, but ultimately you're their baby so they'll have to suck it up. If you tell them you don't want a church wedding because of your fiancé, while they still think you're religious, they're not going to be as understanding. They love you, and probably *like* your fiancé, but it'd be so much easier on your husband (and hopefully clear up the whole issue) if you took some of the heat here. "
Let me guess -- you boil the rice and then drain the water once it's cooked?
Split them 3 ways. Two nights a week isn't really that much maybe if they were staying the majority of every week it could be split 4 ways but from what you've posted that isn't the case. 
Omg. Yes. Please find the Goddamn pit bull champion of divorce lawyers. You deserve something out of this marriage other than humiliation. FUCK this guy. Gross.
"My dad proposed to my mum without a ring while sitting watching her sister play netball. And this year they are celebrating their 30th anniversary and are really happy together. Proposals aren't the be all and end all of the world. You said you thought his proposal was really cute. So when people ask, that's what you tell them. 

I think the problem is you built this proposal up in your head to be a really big thing. And that doesn't sound like the type of person your fiance is. And it sounds like you've known since day 1 that it isn't the type of person he is but you still had a lot of expectations. And that's fine. You're allowed to have expectations and wants and desires. But I just don't think things are as bad as you think they are. 

At the end of the day, the only person ruining this engagement for you is yourself. If you want to be engaged and you want to marry your fiance, does it matter if the proposal wasn't as grand as you hoped? "
"i agree need to go after the dad for child support he helped to make the baby he needs to help pay for it and she wanted the baby then she can take care of it. and when she is 18 and a legal adult she needs to leave, the mom did not get pregnant with her grand kids its not her job to raise it. "
"My point was more along the lines of, the proposal doesn't really matter. If you think you can make a great life with this man, the proposal is just a formality. But from your other comments, it sounds like you have more relationship problems than just the proposal."
"Then you need to be more adamant. If you're in the United States and most providences in Canada, she now is a month to month tenant, and if she doesn't want to leave, you'll need to formally evict her."
"My parents used to do this to me when I was 12 and stopped when I was around 14. They would make me shut everything off and go to bed at 9. I'm 18 now, out of high school, and they don't enforce anything like that. 

The only time that my parents get pissed off and threaten to shut the wifi off etc. is when I'm up all night and sleep all day, mostly due to depression/being a night owl. I understand why they do that in those circumstances, though.

But your parents are being completely unreasonable imo. If none of the advice that you've gotten on here works, I think that you might just have to ride this out until you can get out of there."
The fact that it's a choice it all means you are definitely not over your ex and should probably do you boyfriend a favour and break up with so he can be with someone who would pick him without a second thought.

&gt; And unfortunately, the truth is, most people don't know anything about loyalty and respect.

Actually, nobody has any idea what he is going through because the husband is refusing to communicate. It's not like the OP didn't try to understand.
I don't understand how you're reading the situation and saying this when they husband has shown zero loyalty and respect. This is supposed to be a two way street.

What would you do if your wife refuses to talk to you, lies to you, and you don't know where she goes at night? Keep in mind, you've already tried to communicate and she shuts you down, blows up and gets mad at you each time. Is that not grounds for divorce?"

He talks to his mom on the phone in their language in our house, watches movies in mandarin, and skypes his cousins sometimes as well. But since I'm not a controlling asshat, I don't tell him that he can't do these things because that would be rediculous. And I live here and pay half the rent, stepfather does not live there, pays no rent, and is a guest. Yeah it sometimes bothers me that I can't understand, especially when it's obvious that they're talking about me (I know some phrases) but I suck it up and deal with it because my boyfriend has every right to speak his native language and it's on me if I don't understand it. I also have experience with asshole step fathers who come in and try to control things and tell mothers how to raise their kids, including complaining that she doesn't beat them enough.

"Others have covered the fact that you're not wrong to have a preference for how you would like to spend your free time, and in the end it's totally up to you.

My family has a cottage and it is super, super important to us. That's where we spend quality family time and it's more of a home than the house I grew up in. You said it's only 3-4 weekends a year, so presumably you don't need to take vacation time to visit the cottage - maybe consider going 1-2 times instead of each time? This way you're not missing out entirely on special family time, and not  sending an antisocial message to your husband's family.

This could be a good opportunity to find a compromise that works best for everyone. Good luck!

"Sleeping in a high traffic area is highly exhausting. You get much less sleep than everyone else since you can hardly go to bed before the last person and it's hard to stay asleep after the first person wakes up. 

I don't know about you, but once I wake up, I have a hard time falling asleep again, so for me, the moment I'm woken up pretty much means my night is over.

Also, while earplugs is a good idea, it only works if you can actually sleep with those things on, which I can't because I find the sensation annoying. Next, if they decide to turn on the lights when they wake up a 4am, that's goodbye sleep too.

Also, you can like small dogs and don't like big dogs, after all, big dogs tend to be smellier, take a lot more space and require more ""maintenance"".

Also your ""she should just suck it up"" ""we all do things we don't like for the sake of marriage"" doesn't mean you should sacrifice all your comfort whenever your partner feels like it because it's the ""easy"" thing to do.

She doesn't need to go there twice a year to see her ILs and it seems she's already been going for a while. Why should she throw away 2 weekends a year to go and trap herself in a cottage knowing she won't enjoy it. If the two people care about each other, they would come up with a compromise, not ""you go because I want you to"", this only leads to resentment and is bad for long term relationship, especially if her husband and his family do this 3-4 times a year.

Also, she offered alternatives, all of which are understandable and acceptable, but her ILs refused them, so either she talks about it with them and try to come up with a compromise that will satisfy everyone or, if they refuse to accept things being done differently than they are now, I don't see any reasons why she should still go."
"&gt;If it were really about the symbolism, she wouldn't be throwing a fit like this.

Uh I'd say for a lot of Western women, the symbolism is both the ring and the action behind the ring (aka the ""proposal""). Also women buy men rings too. That's why the ceremony includes an official exchange of the rings, a culturally symbolic action representing each side giving the other a token of their vows. 

It's not ""hey everyone time to put on that random piece of bling you brought to the party"" for a reason."
No it's not. It's a compromise. Do you consider compromises humiliating?

Getting is not the same as keeping for the rest of your lives. 
"If a guy who still has six hours before my date says to me he's exhausted because of stuff he knew he'd be doing when he made our plans so he wants to cancel the plans we had for Saturday night (and for which I inevitably forewent other offers of plans) and we're not in a relationship so I don't have the built-in security of that, I'd be pretty put out and seriously question whether he's serious about me.

If moving furniture and your volunteering exhausts you and a five-hour nap won't fix it you should know that, and not make plans for after you're doing that.  You're an adult, you're expected to know your own limitations and schedule accordingly.  Situations certainly arise, but it seems like you don't acknowledge at all that she likely would've made other plans for Saturday night if she didn't have plans with you, and now if all her other friends have plans she's potentially stuck sitting alone on a Saturday night because you lack self-awareness.

This is one of those situations where you take a nap and power through because you claimed that time in her schedule and it's your responsibility to fill it absent emergency.  And feeling beat isn't an emergency.  You made a commitment, be an adult and don't act like your desire to chill out and go to bed early justifies bailing on your commitment to someone last minute."

"Small weddings are more manageable! The only thing I ever wanted for my wedding was that it be outdoors, surrounded by flowers and running water. I got married in a nearby Japanese tea garden. Guest list was under 30, reception was a cold picnic lunch, entire budget was under $3000, and we got to cap the day playing tourist in our province's capital before going our honeymoon camping trip. Best part was that we didn't have a big bill waiting for us when we got back.

"So others here have already told you to divorce, and why.

What I want to address is your justifications for his behavior:

&gt;He said he has not cheated within the marriage. Does that matter?

No, it doesn't matter. And why believe him anyway?

&gt;Even if he did it because of what I did?

This ""logic"" is heartbreaking. No, it doesn't matter what you did or didn't do, no one is EVER allowed to put their hands on you. Ever. 

There is NO reason or justification for choking, hitting, punching, or hurting another human being. Period.

If you had a daughter, would you want her to be with a man who treats her like your husband treats you? Would you tell your sister, mother, cousin, friend to stay with someone who treats them like you are treated?

Again, this is **BEYOND JUSTIFICATION OR REASONS**, there are NONE. You need to leave before he kills you. As other posters have mentioned, spouses who choke their partners are the most likely to KILL them. Please, please leave before you are hurt again."
"usually people act out about the dishes not being done or toilet paper running out and not having an extra roll in the bathroom when they're stressed, not the fact that their partner dare exist in a sexual fashion before them. his views on your sexual history are much deeper rooted than ""i didn't get enough sleep last night"""
"*but this kind of thing happens ALL the time. I say no and she just won't take no for an answer. no matter what i do, she isn't going to be happy with it.*

Simple solution

Tell the dude you are not interested and drop the friend.  

A friend would ask you if you were interested.  A manipulative dickhole gives out your contact information and then guilts you into doing exactly what they want.  She's not interested in your happiness, she is interested in you being indebted to her for setting you up with someone

You should not be friends with manipulative dickholes.

Just tell the dude that you are not interested in a relationship of any kind right now and that your ""friend"" misled him about your interest level.  Then block him and move on with your life.

"I dunno, I have some sympathy. I grew up with a judgy, outspoken parent, and it took me a while to distance myself emotionally, too. OP needs to deal with it before bringing this girl home, though. "

"I think one of the misconceptions about Tourettes is that the tics are involuntary, like a sneeze, when you actually DO have a certain amount of control. 

I specifically have Echolalia when I will compulsively repeat things I like the sound of, or if someone has an interesting accent. I'm lucky that I don't feel the need to shout and saying things under my breath is enough to get rid of the compulsion. What strikes me as odd is that your BF does not seem at all embarrassed or apologetic, neither does he feel the need to explain any of this. I'm not saying at all that people with mental health issues need to be embarrassed about them, but to embrace and go with the compulsions with that degree of abandon is very surprising to me. In a sense if this is Tourette's I really admire the guy, but the fact that he isn't at all embarrassed for me is evidence that there is no neurological problem."
"You need to take charge. It's a dream job for a reason, this opportunity only comes once. She's going to have to bite the bullet if she wants to be with you. She's probably going to complain about it but so be it. She's already complaining about her jobs even though she'd had multiple opportunities. "
"so if OP has kids, they can never go to the seaside together?"
"She doesn't think the PDA is as cute as you do.  Have some respect for her feelings and keep the private stuff private.  

Nothing wrong with holding hands in public, but if kissing and/or tickling in front of people makes her uncomfortable knock it off.  "
"&gt;I'm upset because she told me she is not comfortable doing these things, yet she has a history of doing them with just friend(s).

I'm seeing a bit of a disconnect here. She already said (in regard to the sexting) that she did it before not because she initiated it, but because she wanted to please her friend. Makes sense that it could be the case with grinding too. 

People try things, and that's how they figure out what they like or don't like. And as I see it, she wasn't lying - she didn't enjoy sexting or grinding in the past. Telling you she didn't like them was the truth. She still lied by omission, I suppose, but unless you were asking her about her past experiences and she denied having any, she seems to be truthful.

I would caution you though on other matters. 

First, she said before that she sexted to please the guy. Now you say that she's responding back with equal ardor when you initiate it. Are you sure she is still OK with this, and not just replying in a way she thinks will please you?

Second, you're 18 and in a LDR. If you're horny, date someone who lives near you AND is totally into sexual stuff. Your girlfriend is far away and seems to not be. It may be best to reconsider whether this relationship is what you want. Just food for thought. "
"Yeah, I think pretty much everyone is gonna have a problem with your explicit second choice hanging around. That's pretty clearly someone you want a relationship with kept around for what? Break glass in case of fire?"
"If your idea of a therapist is the kind of person who would say that hand lotion thing, you obviously aren't choosing a therapist appropriately.

"I hope OP considers this. He really might just need a break. It's not just the financial responsibility. OP said that he has been her best friend for the longest time, and that is a massive responsibility. It is extremely hard to be someone's best friend, Mentor, social outlet, person to vent to, and so on. He might just be exhausted, and need her to find another outlet.

I have a friend like this, who relies on me emotionally for everything, and it is so draining. I have often wanted to cut her out of my life, but I'm working on setting boundaries. That said, I understand that if my friend does not respect my boundaries, then I will have to cut her out of my life for good."

I think the implied point is he presented it as a gift even though he used credit in her name to do it. 
"Dear, if she means anything to you: Leave. You don't wish a relationship on someone that is grounded in coercion rather than love, not even in a twisted way when technically she benefits because she gets to have you around as per her wish. 

You are not doing something unforgivably terrible, and nothing that would justify suicide when you leave. Every day plenty of people are broken up with and they grieve but then get their shit together. If she can't, and does commit suicide, keep in mind that it is not your fault, or that you could and should have prevented it, because it isn't and you couldn't. What she has is some severe mental/affective disorder that is not in your hands, and you're not her sitter. So pick up your courage, and leave. Don't look back. 

I waited around because I was fairly sure my now-ex would recover a bit and not follow through with the threat (if I only waited), but I do wish I had left earlier. My ex is reasonably fine and alive, two years after I left."

"Its hard to put in every detail of our friendship, and to get across what type of guy he is. Lets just say he is the BEST friend anyone could have, but not an amazing boyfriend. Always the type to want what he can't have. Thats what I'm scared of, because when I was in a relationship, he was showing signs of wanting me, and now that Im out of one, he hasn't really showed any signs. He has just been pining over his ex, and we just got drunk a couple of times. I know what I want in my heart, but theres the other side of the coin of what if he doesn't work out, it could ruin the best friendship Ive ever had. Like without sounding melodramatic, but i know he would die for me, and I would die for him, all feelings aside. Its a lot to risk, and the last few days since we had sex, he has been distant, not his usual self, ignoring me etc. So that doesn't give me a lot of confidence i suppose.  
Also I really appreciate your advice! Couldn't concentrate or do anything in work since its happened. Just been feeling really low. "
"A dowry is different from a bride price, for the exact reason you mentioned."
"He is being incredibly disrespectful and rude towards you. He is also trying to turn it around on you and make it seem like it is your fault, which is gaslighting.  This behavior makes you feel that you are ""less than"" and he is somehow ""above you"".  It is manipulative and bullying.  And it is working, as evidenced here:

""It seems like he doesn't think I'm fun enough or worth going to a wedding with, even when I've offered to pay for everything because its so important to me that he's there. ""
""I feel like he's just told me that I'm not as important to him as his friends. What am I supposed to do here? Am I overreacting over this?""

See that self - doubt?  That was planted by his gaslighting.  It is a method of controlling you and keeping you small.  You are not over-reacting, he is clearly out of line.


""I then asked him why he went to a wedding in another city for people he didn't like. He took his female friend instead of me and didn't even invite me to the wedding. ""  This may even have been an underhanded, cowardly bid at getting you to break up with him.  

This behavior is designed to make you feel terrible about yourself.  When you feel badly about yourself, you undervalue yourself and you are easily controlled.  Rip the bandaid off and find a guy who is not a manipulative coward. Don't buy into the way he is treating you.  Gaslighting is a sign of a very insecure, weak personality. Drop him like a bad habit. The good news is you will likely feel a weight off your shoulders when you dump him.  You deserve better!"

"I mean, if he was a decent guy he wouldn't be in the position of cutting people out. He'd have stood up for you and respected you and stopped talking to her all on his own. Quite honestly, your friends probably don't have enough experience at their age in handling the ""friend has a shitty boy/girlfriend"" situation and thought an ultimatum would be the most effective way to remove you from a shitty relationship. Probably the same reason they persistently tried to get you to hang with them instead of him (Granted, if these are the best ways they can think of to try to help you, then some new friends wouldn't be a bad thing to start trying to get). And now, here you are, trying not to breakup with a shitty, double-standard having boyfriend when you're in the prime of your life and could be doing much better things with your life than dealing with this crap. I sincerely hope things turn out better for you going forward."
"No. ""If you're lucky""....Ew."
"You left twenty minutes into her set and took down a painting she made for you.
Neither of those actions is supportive. When you love someone, sometimes you do things you don't totally enjoy for the sake of the other persons feelings. That's what supporting someone you care about is a lot of times. That's showing love to them. It's not like she's asking you to be moved to tears from her music or painting. She is asking you to respect her and her feelings enough to sit through an hour of music or hang a painting she made for you. You place more value on your time and your aesthetic than her feelings. 

I think you need to really look at your actions and rethink your definition of supportive. You come across as very selfish.

"Hey, thanks for your comment. I have been sitting here for a few minutes thinking about it, and I'm willing to admit the possibility that there may be a kernel of truth in me wanting to teach her a lesson. Not a conscious choice, but reading my post over I can detect a strong ""reap what you sow"" vibe coming from me. I will have to take time to examine my motives - perhaps part of me resents the amount of effort I've put into trying to help her while she hurts others, and anger that she would expect me to just live with it after knowing what it feels like to be cheated on. Thanks again for the perspective. "
"I went through something similar. Guy told me he broke up with a woman in college, just broke all contact with her, and could never voice why. Made it sound like he was young, scared of commitment, regretted it deeply, and if he had it to do over basically ANY other way, he would.

And honestly, who among us hasn't made *some* kind of interpersonal mistake where we later realize we were a selfish, childish, immature dumbass? I sure have.

Well, guess what he did. 

After a year and a half of a perfectly normal relationship, he just broke all contact. "

It's too bad I won't be able to join you on this trip, but I have learned that we need to be more direct about splitting costs in the future. ""

Their reaction will tell you a lot. Personally, I would think hard about how much you want these people entrenched in your life (lives)."
"They saw it from a different perspective. I think my mind works similar to yours so I would've wanted him to spell it out too. Overthinking does cause more problems than really exist, at least in my experience. Also the timing of him saying I love you could depend a lot on how often you get to spend time together. If you only get to spend time with each other a couple of times a month it would be hard to get close enough to someone to fall in love. If you are together a lot that seems a little off. Maybe he is just a really cautious person and hasn't let himself get in deep with you yet. "
"From what I'm reading your conversation with your wife seems to be about each other pointing fingers at each other. (Totally called for and totally justifiable.) However, this kind of conversation will get you guys nowhere and will never resolve the elephant in the room: broken trusts.

In order for you guys to be better at your relationship trust wise, I suggest you start talking about your feelings and not about excuses. Sit down with her and tell her how you feel about everything, then to bring it closer to home just ask her ""how would you feel if I did exactly the same thing as you did?""

From there, you just shut up and listen to her whole story. Rebuilding trust is something BOTH OF YOU have to do TOGETHER. Work out a plan TOGETHER. Think about what feelings are lacking from both sides."

It's unreasonable to expect that everyone who ever enters your property be properly trained on how to deal with the dog. It's the dog who should be trained, and if the training isn't working...

A rescue might be able to find a home that is a good fit for her, but this clearly isn't that situation. I agree with you, but if your SO insists on keeping this dog, you probably want to look into upping your insurance policy. It's only a matter of time before she bites someone who won't just brush it off.

He will not change. He will only get worse. You know this. You had the strength and courage to leave an abusive relationship once before. You definitely can do it again. You can do it!
"Your boyfriend survived 37 years in the world without you as his full-time attendant, and he will survive after you are gone, as well.

Nothing- absolutely nothing- about this relationship sounds positive or healthy *for either of you*. You are *one* year in and you've been unhappy for a significant portion of it. You are self-sabotaging dreams, have given up your friends, your interests, the entertainment you enjoy- you are contemplating giving up your pets. 

You need a therapist, really badly. Really really badly. ""God wants me to rejoice in the pain of giving up dreams and goals"" is some bonkers rationalization. 

Get help, get out. "
"I totally see what you're saying and why you think I'm suggesting something op is already doing. But what I'm suggesting and what they're doing are two different things. What they're doing is trying to both sleep through the night and taking turns getting up with the baby and calling that shifts. Part of the problem with doing that is neither parent is getting a regulated amount of sleep because they're basing their sleep off of the baby's cues. 

What I'm suggesting is structured, timed, predictable shifts. Where one parent is in bed asleep and the other is in a separate room on baby duty. That way every night they both know they can get 5-6 hours of undisturbed rest. And by taking first shift, op can stay awake since he struggles with waking up once he's asleep. "

"I've had this kind of friend before. It's absolutely exhausting. 

In your shoes, I'd start by asking her if she wants you to be honest with her, or if she just wants you to comfort her. If her answer is comfort her, that doesn't mean that you have to pour an everlasting fountain of emotional energy into maintaining her feelings. You can still draw boundaries around how much you're willing to be her emotional support.

If she chooses the first door, though, I'd tell her that you think a lot of her relationship problems come from her expecting a boyfriend to fulfill the role of therapist, and that it's something that she does with friends, too. She needs to find an actual therapist to fulfill that role in her life so that she can have healthy relationships otherwise. "

"&gt; I just can't care that much, and who would want to. 

She wants you to, or she wouldn't talk about it with you. You don't have to be on her level of understanding, but having some interest in what she does everyday would be beneficial for both of you. I work in epigenetics while my husband doesn't have a college degree. He often comments on how he only truly understands maybe half of what I tell him about my work, but he likes to learn and asks questions. You should also develop your own interests; read a book on something you're interested in, watch a documentary and tell her about it. That'll make it feel more equal in what y'all have to bring to conversations

&gt; and while she if very thoughtful and gentle about it, it always just feels like she is saying I'm dumb and she knows more than I do

From this reply I get the feeling that you're more insecure about the fact that she has corrections or improvements at all rather than her being rude. If she is ""thoughtful and gentle"" about it, what's the problem? Are her suggested improvements valid and helpful to your household or are they pointless and just needless criticisms? I think that's an important distinction to figure out for you. Is she trying to be helpful in a kind way (and overdoing it), or is she being particular and bossy needlessly?"
"I am leaning on trolling because this is like something out of a horror film.

"Definitely break up.  You're clearly really angry with her for not eating the food you make (even though it doesn't sound like she asked for any of that), not attending the classes you signed her up for, and not cycling with the bike you bought her, despite you telling her to cycle her fat ass around.

You haven't used labels like 'overweight' or 'obese' and I wonder if that's because she's quite tall and can carry 170lbs and be within a healthy BMI.  You do realise that you dated a teenager and now she's mid 20s, so, generally speaking, people will gain weight in those years.  Especially when they go from having loads of free time to having a ""busy work schedule""?

It's fine to no longer be attracted to someone for any host of reasons.  You two clearly don't share lifestyle goals.  It sounds like you're unlikely to accept anyone unless they also lift, bro.  Which is fine!  But you can say that you've both matured/changed, and now have different interests and lifestyles, and you feel like communication and intimacy has been suffering.  Because all of that is true.

Do not be cruel about this and tell her that her failure to lose weight is the cause of your inability to be aroused.  The way that you write this implies that you haven't been particularly subtle and she probably has some self esteem issues and maybe an eating disorder.  Not up to you to diagnose (or me), but if you care about her, be kind and wish her well.

On the off chance that you're unbelievably forceful in telling her what to eat, how to work out, and what to wear when she does that, yet have somehow avoided telling her that you're not particularly happy in the relationship, then you should do that first.  Be honest and say that working out is a really big part of your identity and you can't be in a relationship with someone who ""half asses"" their own workout, or is not effortlessly slim.  Possibly she is unbelievably attached to you and will be motivated by knowing that you are going to end things if she doesn't meet your expectations."
"This is tricky. I think you have a right to be upset about the exclusion. But I think trying to bring it up makes it look like it's about money. Obviously saying ""why wont you pay for my meal"" looks a bit selfish and rude despite that not being the underlying issue here.

"Demote her from MOH.  Hell, kick her out of the wedding party.

See, she doesn't stop the attention whoring, does she?

Right.  So, you need to impose consequences.  This is one fucking hell of a boundary she just blew through:  when are you going to start erecting and defending your boundaries, OP?  This wasn't a ""little thoughtless fun,"" which is undoubtedly the excuse used to enable her behavior her entire life.  I bet you've been told by your parents, ""Oh, she doesn't *mean* it, OP!  Forgive your little sister!""

Yeah, fuck that noise.  What she did took thought and planning; there were any number of steps along the way where she could have stopped herself, but the ""joke"" was just so delicious, the attention to be garnered just so irresistible--and all she's ever had to do was whine she was sorry in the past, so win/win for her!

Throw her out of the wedding party.  This will be probably the first lesson she's ever had that her ""adorable"" behavior is out of line and has real world consequences.

Your parents will whine and cajole, no doubt, which will be an opportunity for you to stand up for yourself and defend your boundaries against *them.*  It is also an opportunity for you to start rejecting what I suspect is the harmful dynamic in your family:  you're the smart, successful one who's always had to be responsible and your sister is the pretty, flighty one who can't really be held responsible for her behavior?

Put your foot down.  She is out.  See if you can't find a new dress or perhaps have the old one refashioned--find a dressmaker and see what could be changed to make it something new.

You're getting married, which means you need to divorce yourself  from your family--not in the sense of cutting them out, but in the sense of leaving that dynamic behind and creating a new one with your husband.  You need to stop ""tolerating"" (i.e., enabling) your sister's ""antics"" because she will not stop:  I'm sure her Instagram posts about your honeymoon are going to be hy-lar-i-ous."

If your parents see you with a bag or suitcase out or packing they could get suspicious that you're trying to run and I'm very worried that your dad could attempt to physically prevent you from escaping....Only take essentials in your purse and PLEASE RUN. Stay safe. "
"I guess it depends on of BF is going to continue to act this way.  

If this is who he is, and OP isn't allowed to receive a gift HE might perceive as ""romantic"" from anyone other than himself, then it probably is break-up worthy.

BF's reaction isn't normal.  It's not healthy.  And he called her a LIAR.  And he hasn't apologized yet.  Not only that, but he told OP SHE overreacted.  So now, it's HER fault he got upset that a 4-year-old brought her flowers for her birthday.

Imagine if OP had told us that BF initially reacted badly, but apologized and admitted he was wrong.  I think we could say sure, maybe he had a bad day and we could give him the benefit of the doubt as long as it doesn't happen again.  That's not the case.  He doubled down on it.  OP just learned a lesson about who her BF really is.  You know how the rest of the saying goes."
Lol. Good luck with your dating. 
This guy is a misogynistic creep and douche. You shouldn't even want to be friends with him anymore.
Are you kidding?! Red flag much?! 
"Um therapy can come after he makes one of those choices but it's not actually an option to be taken alone. 

Unless you think therapy will help him get over his sex drive. Or help her get hers back. But to suggest that she just needs therapy so she can have sex with him again is just ridiculous. "
"Time is running out - biology isn't fair.

Just bring it up.  If he doesn't want kids, you need to know now.  If he wants them in 10 years, you need to know now.  You might now get an answer you like, but waiting another year to ask does you no good.

If you need a jump off point, the next time you're watching tv and someone has a baby, ask how he feels about kids."
"Just reading that first paragraph. If you did that, yes, you were being abusive. 

Edit: Reading the rest, yeah you were abusive to this poor girl. If you can't recognize that from the behavior she's describing, I think you need to talk to someone. "
"His behaviour is really shitty and unfair at this point. He can't be all that of a good person to be putting ultimatum pressures on his relationship with someone so much younger than him. So there is definitely a power imbalance. Usually when age-gap relationships are genuine the older party takes alot of care in ensuring that the younger one is not being bull-dozed and has an interest in seeing them grow. He should have instead be doing his damn best to work through his resentment. Seeking therapy, trying to find common ground with you whatever...
As soon as your sister wisens up he will be gone. I really hope that happens because what he is doing is not sustainable.  

For now, I think that your sister needs the support of your family more than you do (simply because of her age and the tendency to do something stupid), let her be able to attend family functions etc. I think your parents are choosing the lessor of two evils and looking at it from an outside perspective this might be their only choice. When she needs them, they need to be there. 

On your part, reiterate your apology and take every opportunity to show your humility and understanding about the stuff you have put him through. This is for him yes, but also for your sister to see and realise that you are a good person. He will end up looking bad because of his unforgiveness. 

Play by his rules, eventually if he so bitter and cannot move on from his past and is insistant on dividing his S.O's family. This relationship is not going to last.

Honestly, we all make mistakes and have a past. Even if he was dealing with something HUGE (e.g the death of his children), it wears on his relationships if he cannot move forward and live in the present, if every interaction he has with your family is stained by this past. This is so tiring and it will wear people out."
"She's thinking ""if we are already thinking of getting marriage counseling before we are married, fuck that noise I'm done"". When I got married, marriage counseling was never even mentioned. I totally understand her point of view. "
"It sounds like your BF's job is extremely demanding and is causing him a ton of stress.  Is there an expectation that he'll always work such long hours, or is this something he needs to do for a few months/years to ""pay his dues""?  Are you sure he actually likes this job?  I don't personally think it's healthy to work such long hours that you have no free time and need to spend your weekends sleeping to be able to get through the week.  Even if this is your BF's dream job, surely he still needs free time and time to relax.

I'd back off of the gym thing for now - sounds like BF hardly has time to eat and sleep, let alone work out.  I would, however, talk to him about this job.  It's okay to abandon a dream job if it turns out to be shitty."
"My dad finally adopted my brother and sister (both half) a few years ago. They were well into their 40s, and my dad was nearly 60. The only reason he waited is because he didn't want to somehow make their biodad less important (he died before I was born). I can't think of a time when I was as happy as when I signed as a witness. The judge cried. It was beautiful. "
"You : be my bf so I can sleep with you

Him: hehe okay, I'm your bf for the hours of sex we have and nothing further 😂"
"Entitlement for sure.  This is my aunt, 50 something years old.  Whenever she visits she practically clears out the bathroom of toiletries.  We even removed everything from the guest bathroom and she went into my parents' ensuite (had to go through their bedroom) to take tooth paste.  She claims she forgets hers but then she takes it with her every time. Last visit she also went through the pantry and took a half bag of chips and my packed lunch from the fridge.  You can call her out on it, never helps.  There's always a reason why she needed the stuff or thought you said she could have it or it accidentally fell in her bag.  We don't have her over anymore.  "
" If you wants you to stay here and give it more time what is he doing to fight the racism that you're experiencing every day  so that you can stay and enjoy your time here ? 

 If he's not doing anything then I'm sorry but you need to start looking out for yourself, your safety, and your needs .  Since he is doing that already . "
"Either you have an exceptionally stupid boyfriend or he doesn't understand because he doesn't want to understand. If he did understand, he might have to accept the validity of your concerns and consider changing things. To me, this seems like a big red flag. Think carefully about whether you want to be with him. "
"She is not being reasonable. She signed the legally binding lease, she chose to move out immediately. It is HER responsibility to pay what she owes, per the contract until she is taken OFF the contract by the rental authority or it expires, whichever comes first.

You don't just get to back out of a contract without taking the appropriate steps."
Bf broke up with her in a house of his friends - of course she was forced! It is his problem as his actions caused the current uncomfortable situation. 
"4 months?

THere's nothing really left to save here, in my opinion. Give me your phone, I'll break up with her for you."
"It's probably worth finding out exactly where the line is for you and your wife.

Like, if you took a job that made $399k/year, but you were living close to family in Canada, your wife probably wouldn't be mad that you were making ""less,"" right?

What if it was $380k? $350? What if you were making $200k, but you have investment properties that would earn $80k passively every year? What if you were living somewhere where a $200k job bought you all the same luxuries that your $400k job does where you are now?

Even if you decide to keep working at your current job, you and your wife still need a plan for what to do with all that money to make it last. What happens if you become disabled, or your company folds?

The paradox about a stressful job is that sometimes, even though you're easily making enough to retire on, you don't have the time and the headspace to sit down and plot out exactly what you need to do to make that money last. All of a sudden, the ride is over, and you're just asking yourself where the hell millions and millions of dollars went, what you were working so hard for anyway."

"I dunno, OP.  It's not like he's some guy you only met after they started dating.  You've known both of them for over 13 years.  There's really no obvious reason to evaluate/judge that her pain was worse than his pain in the nasty ending of a 9 year relationship, or that her pain is more worthy of support because she's a female friend.    I think it comes down to which one you regard as a closer friend at the present time.  It does speak in his favor that he came to you afterward because he wanted to maintain a friendship with you and that he has never disparaged her to you.  Can you say the same about her?"
"&gt;So we kind of had inadvertently ultimatumed each other, and now we're stuck

Inadvertently? No, you both knew what you were doing. If this is how you communicate, I don't think the relationship had much a future anyway. "
"You didn't cheat, but you are looking for a way out of this relationship. Don't lie to yourself either, be honest with yourself. It seems like you're unhappy with this relationship, and I don't blame you. It doesn't sound like your bf is in a good place right now. But it's up to you to decide if you want to continue this, don't string him along if you want out. "
"Hey OP, I'm planning my wedding right now too (I'm the bride). I would hate it if my future in-laws tried to plan things differently from how my fiancé and I envision them.

You really need to back up your future wife in this. This won't be the last time your mom and sister try to take control of your life, but it's not just your life anymore, it's the life you're building with your wife. If you're choosing to be with her you really need to show that you support her."
Were you clear with them?  Or were you coy?
"Yes, and behaviors exhibited by OP's brother could land him in an early grave. So OP's parents have their work cut out for them"
"This makes you look really bad. Unprofessional and untrustworthy. You've shown them that even when you're dating someone else, you don't stop others from hitting on you. It sounds like you've had numerous chances to shut them down, and didn't. Facesitting is a pretty heavy topic."
"Seriously. A couple/few grand is nowhere near a small fortune.

More like a weeks worth of gummi bears."

"&gt;I just worry about my child and I want what's best for him. I would hate for him to grow up in a divorced family because I know how hard that is on kids.

You also need to think about the example you're setting for your child. You're raising them to think this is a normal and acceptable relationship. Children often repeat the patterns that play out in their home life. Is this the kind of relationship you'd want for them when they grow up?"
"Wait until your kids are grown to start riding again.  That way if you crash and wind up in a nursing home with severe brain trauma or dead, your wife won't have to deal with raising your kids alone.

Am I'm dead serious about the nursing home scenario.  When I worked at one as a nursing assistant, we had a man who had crashed his motorcycle and he was barely a step up from a vegetable.  He was in diapers and was fed via a feeding tube.  He could blink his eyes and smile, but not talk or u derstand what people were saying"
"Graphic designer here -- some people are ok with banging out a resume in 12 pt. Times New Roman in Microsoft Word for certain professions. For more appearance-oriented jobs (design, marketing, etc.) it's important to have a clean and well-designed resume layout that stands out from the rest. Worth paying someone with strong typography skills to do it well."
"I do want to let you know that what you are describing is 100% abusive, and often done in an escalation of behavior to see how you take it. Its alongside things like stepping on peoples toes to see how they react and the abuser says ""Sorry"" yet keeps on doing it. Its intentional. 

And abusers often wait to escalate their behavior until they feel the victim is ""trapped"" by marriage, living together, isolation, pregnancy or kids. And abusers dont abuse all the time. Who would ever be in a relationship with them if they did? In fact, its only a small number of events in the course of a year. It doesnt diminish it. 

And its not a case of him being dense or unaware of that boundary. Its him clearly dismissing your boundary and pushing to the next. Its intentional. He knows what hes doing. And with abusers, its NEVER recommended to go to marital counseling or therapy with them. Abusers use that safe space to hurt you, by turning a therapist against you to isolate you more, or listening to the things you say with openness to hurt you easier. 

He intends to upset you, refuse you control over your own body, and is enjoying it. Its not a mistake. Its intentional. Without a doubt. This is who he really is. Abusers have ""masks"" they wear to project who they think you want to see. That person, the one you fell in love with, likely never existed. They are trading on your belief that the person is real to hurt you more. 

And people that cant do solid harsh confrontation when their boundaries are pushed even a little bit are great targets for abusers. Im quite concerned for your safety, OP. Its only going to get worse and more violent. "
"Manipulation and blaming every problem on you is not a ""slightly rocky"" relationship. You are being repeatedly manipulated and likely emotionally abused. 

&gt; it's stressing him out too much to never be able to spend time with me without her interfering or getting angry, etc

Mike is sick of competing with your batshit girlfriend for your time and attention because he shouldn't have to. You shouldn't be dating such a controlling, jealous, immature person.

You and Sarah have become a package deal and she is *so fucking awful* that your best friend of a decade would rather lose you than deal with her. Reread that until you fully understand that this is not a decision he made lightly.

Your friend isn't ""just cutting you off"", Sarah has been pushing him away for ages and you haven't done much to stop her, so he's done trying to stick around. This is absolutely not on him, it is mostly on your girlfriend but also largely on you and your continued enabling of your girlfriend's terrible behavior. He feels disrespected because your girlfriend is awful to you *and* them and ***you*** don't respect yourself or your friends enough to even acknowledge that what she has been doing is abhorrent. 

Dump her. Go no contact. Apologize to your friends for subjecting them to her abuse and ask for help recognizing the signs of abusive, controlling people because your ""red flag detector"" is super broken if you think your relationship is even slightly healthy. "
"It's your body, and you can stop when you want. Just stop. If he throws a fit, let him.

He's not ""forcing"" you -- you just don't want to deal with him getting upset. It's time to let him get upset and stand your ground."
"Not unless you only use one password for everything. Not secure, but people do it."
"Why do you need negative attention? Just let it happen naturally. For example, growing up, my mother would criticize my dirty room or arguing with my brother. Or other normal issues for being a teen, like staying out late. I mean she'll likely catch you masturbating, that's just life as a teenager. However, you shouldn't make your parents aware of your fetishes/vices willingly. That just seems weird and might belie larger issues. "
Dude...you need to ask for some therapy or med's for that.  This kind of thing leads to self destruction.  It is actually a side affect of anxiety/depression.  You don't have to live like this....you deserve love and positive attention.  We all do.
"&gt;I wish I was like those **ditsy girls** who longed for marriage all their lives and can't wait to change their last names, for my husband, but I'm not. 

You are entirely entitled to your preferences regarding changing your own name, but so is everyone else, and this is just fucking rude, condescending, and demeaning.  Your opinion is not ""right"" and other are not ""wrong"" or ""ditsy"" for disagreeing with you.   

Edit: Oh man, this whole thing is so much worse than a rude anti-feminist attitude.  If you go to arsenewenger97's profile and find their post in r/ sex subreddit, she discussed the fact that they've been long distance (Argentina and somewhere else) the entire three years they've been together, have only spent seven months total around each other in person, and got married because she didn't want to move just to date him.  This entire thing is a massive exercise in bad decisions and poor judgment, I'm 1000% less surprised that they never talked about stuff like this now that I know what a shitshow the whole debacle is.  When people in the r/ sex thread tried to explain to her what a terrible plan this was, she got super defensive and started referencing medieval standards for marriage to validate her choices.  What a disaster."
You'll be asked to pay the bill next month and the month after that. Then it'll be cable and water. 
"This is a bad idea. H&amp;R block will prepare her taxes, tell her she isn't actually getting a big refund, since she likely hasn't worked a lot the last year, and still charge her for it."
"It would have been rude of her to tell you your SO can't go due to her +1 rule, *if* you had asked about him specifically and she was giving other people other answers and lying about that to you. It's not rude of her to change her mind about +1's in general during the wedding planning process, or for her to give some people a +1 invitation and others not. It's her wedding, she can invite who she wants; your control is limited to deciding whether or not to go. You could also have asked her politely about factors important to your ability/desire to attend (e.g. dietary restrictions, venue accessibility, whether you could bring your SO) when you first received the invitation, but that ship has sailed.

One of the main reasons for inviting significant others that the bride and groom don't know or aren't close to is to ensure that everyone at the wedding is having a good time. If they can't afford to invite everyone to bring a guest, they may have prioritized people who they knew wouldn't have a group to hang out with, or who specifically asked about bringing someone. You aren't one of those people; while you've been really negative about the *bride* in your post and comments, it's clear you expected to have fun at the wedding without your SO. Why would she have expected anything different for you? And if the two of you aren't close and you haven't mentioned any other connection your SO has to her or her fiance, it's not likely he's close enough to them to get an invitation because of his own importance to them.

Their wedding is about their relationship, not yours. "
"&gt;  I guess no potential partner can ever really be perfect.

No, because nobody is perfect. But they can come a lot closer than financially supporting a grown man. Who knows? Maybe he is actively looking for work, and has a plan to move out in a month or two. But you won't know unless you have a tough conversation."
"What do you want us to say? Do you want us to help you build a strategy for winning your girlfriend back? Do you want us to commiserate with you about how stubborn your girlfriend is? Do you want us to call you names so you can call us names and discredit our advice?

You fucked up. You know you fucked up. Your girlfriend knows you fucked up. Sometimes, when people fuck up, they get a reprieve. This is not one of those times. If your girlfriend had posted on here, we'd tell her to break up with you. You've apologized for your actions, and I'm glad you recognize your error. Now absorb the consequences and move on with your life."
Grief affects everyone differently. 
"Let's hope he gets his head figured out fast. He's not acting weirded out, he's acting judgey. It's especially ridiculous because it probably has to do with the amount that you have, when most guys don't bat an eyelash over a woman taking bc, which covers a much longer period of time (and therefore more sex)! If he acts normal going forward, that's fine, but if it's still something he brings up again I'd be reconsidering dating him tbh. "
"Ok, so you asked advice about what you should do moving forward. I see a lot of people bitching at you for what you should have done, and honestly, I wouldn't waste your time feeling bad about it. We don't know what your abilities are or what you thought your marriage was like. You can't do anything about the past, so let's start with moving forward:
    I wouldn't come out of the gate screaming divorce and forensic accountants to your husband. He's an attorney, and IF you decide later that is what you'd like to do, in sure you'd like to maintain the element of surprise so he can't cover his tracks. I also think that your post isn't teeming with marital issues, so I'm assuming th nuclear option isn't necessary yet.
    I'd start with the bank and find out where money is going. If he makes large cash withdrawals see if you are paying for a safe deposit box. It's easier to find out at some banks than others, but try.
    Do you have a financial planner? Schedule a meeting with them.
    Do you have an accountant? Schedule a meeting there too.
    Call your insurance agent. Some agents (State Farm comes to mind, but there are others) sell banking products too. See if there are any new accounts.
    Run a credit report. If there are any major debts, they should show on the credit report.
    I think you already know this, but moving forward your household finances should be a joint responsibility.
    Next, your son needs stuff. I'm sure your husband has something of value that can be sold. A watch? Golf clubs? If he has a new/nice car tell him to sell it and downgrade to a clunker. Your son needs things right now, he also needs to see that his father is accountable. If your husband isn't willing to sacrifice some luxuries for his child's needs THEN you can start plays it mean mama Griz. Go advocate for and protect your cub. 
    Get a job. If shit hits the fan, you will be in a better position to make good long term decisions instead of putting out short term fires if you have income. Friends and family will also be more likely to assist you on they know you are trying to earn.
    Good luck, and remember: don't get mad, don't get even. Get what you want."
"""I'm not going to do that.  I'm not going to pay a penny."" 

Be ready for this to end your relationship, but it is healthier for you to know that now.  "
"&gt; get to know the person under it's whiskery shadow

This made my day. Hahaha
"
"Not out of anger, just for practical reasons, as I explained later.  There's plenty of people to be friends with in the world so OP's friend and her BF may choose against maintaining a friendship with someone one of them has slept with."
This will lead to other things.  She has a completely different set of expectations from what you're use to from her (especially if this came out of the blue).  OP needs to reassess does he REALLY know is fiance? Is it all fake?
"Maybe you could find work on campus? Hang out with colleagues and start networking from there. Especially if its major related. It will definitely help you out in the future!

Be careful about transferring, make sure you have a plan on how you are going to make friends once you transfer. Look at the schools clubs, work opportunities, fraternities, don't just wander into a new school and expect a different result. "
"It shouldn't be either you or her. Both of you need to have interest, access, control and awareness of your finances. Together. "
"My husband has condoms from before he met me, over three years ago. We don't use condoms.

You're being a little ridiculous."
"I like how you assumed she was so stupid that she didn't even know how to google the word ""conjecture"" if she didn't know what it meant. "
"Idk, you ever pay more for extra leg room, upgrade to first class, splurge on dessert? Everyone has a preference and some are willing to pay more to be comfortable. It doesn't seem outrageous to me to feel more comfortable flying with your partner. To each their own "
"&gt; My parents used that car *a lot*, and I have absolutely zero bad feelings about it

&gt; he said he *never* got to play...He said that they *didn't have* a computer for him to play on.

Sometimes it IS that simple. This is one of those times
"Or just move on because she'll be moving to Colorado soon anyway and, when she does, all of this drama will have taken place for nothing"
It's pretty small if there's 12 people and 4 dogs in it...
"I know you're getting a lot of crap being called a hypocrite but i think it's like with kids. Sometimes you need adult only time and not have to worry about the ruckus or them running around or getting in where they shouldn't. Sounds like maybe the dogs are not trained and keep people awake all night. She herself gets a sitter so that she doesn't have to spend her time worrying about her dog, not sure why this makes her a bad person. 12 people in a 1500 sq ft house seems like a mess to begin with, let alone with 4, seemingly, untrained and large dogs running around. I'm sorry but I too wouldn't not spend all my vacation time being miserable just to please family and not be judged. Maybe go 1 weekend instead of all of them? I would definitely explain to your husband the situation though vs just saying it's because the dogs. I think the dogs are just what push this to the point where it's really not fun."
"Nah, I'm a woman and I hate when dudes get all clingy after a hook up. Not true universally at all "
The more I think about this comment the more important it was for me to hear. Thanks again.
"You can be a mom later in life when you are living on your own, supporting yourself, and have the means to support a child.

You say it's not fair to not let the fetus be born, but in my opinion it's even less fair to bring a child into the world when it is unwanted by at least one of its parents. 

I'm sure there are counseling services available for young women who have their pregnancies terminated. I never want children myself but if I had to terminate a pregnancy then I know I would have lasting issues about it, so I totally understand you.

You need to tell James that you are pregnant and do not plan on keeping the child since neither of you can support one right now. If you two have enough private time together that you can have sex, you have enough time to go to a clinic. 

And I would suggest that he wear condoms from now on if you two continue to have sex with each other. If he doesn't like to wear them, maybe this will change his mind."
"Seconded on the ""Can I take you out"" wording.

Very clear, let's her know it's a date.  If she says no, reiterates what a good friend you are, or asks if she can bring other people, then she has no interest."
"Why would you think your hypothetical sister's BF would be extremely rude to pitch a tent at your house in that situation? 

Do you normally want your guests to be unhappy and have bad sleep? 

(Genuine question, I'm struggling to make sense of this. I thought basically all hosts want their guests to be comfortable given the limitations of their house.) "
"I mean fair enough if it was a massive amount, but what does £100 get you these days really? 

A peaceful life is worth much more than £100."
"This sounds so, so similar to my family. I'm sorry that your stepdad is such an asshat.

If you feel you need to cut them off, do it. But I am strongly of the opinion that you should not send them anything to the effect of ""My sister hates you"" if she still has to live with them. Maybe she just wants to fly under the radar, and if that's what she needs to do to survive there until she moves out, then let her do that."
"&gt;I don't want to seem like the crazy girlfriend demanding certain text frequencies.

But it's not crazy; if you're in an LDR and he doesn't text back, it sounds like you guys go the rest of the day without any communication. Do you ever call one another? Skype? Email? It's not like you have the option of hanging out in the same room so this becomes less a matter of texting and more a matter of lack of any communication whatsoever. And it would be especially irksome if you're doing all of the initiating and checking in."
Good job OP. Family is hard sometimes but you don't have to stay in contact just because they're family. Good luck with everything :) 
"I don't think it's that - she specifically said ""I physically can't"", but also ""other women can"". Although it's not really clear if she means ""animated women can do this physically impossible thing but I can't""."
"&gt; I apologized over and over again told her I love her, she is the one for me. She said I broke her heart and asked if she was enough of a ""woman"" for me, what she did wrong?

This is one of the many reasons why cheating fucking sucks, makes the other person question themselves completely even if they literally did nothing wrong and the cheater is just an asshole."
"/u/memecitydreams is right, you should block her and be done with it. You may care for this girl, but you aren't her guardian or her parent so there isn't much you can do at all about it and trying to intervene might just get you in a lot deeper into the shit pile than you once used to be in. Could cost you more than money, maybe your job or worse."
"I'm pretty sure even MLK Jr would tell you to give the guy another shot, if your entire stance is based on a bad joke. Also, it sounds like this party would involve other families. So you'd have plenty of people to talk to that are not him."

"okay i'm going to be very blunt here... which fear would you rather face: confrontation or the death of your child? i apologize for being harsh, but come on. the health of your baby should come before anything else. it's not that big a deal to go outside to smoke."
"Leave as soon as you can. I lived with an ex for a month after he broke up with me. It was the worst month of my life. 

But, if you're stuck, technically she can't just kick you out anyway."
"I remember a similar post on here a while back that turned out to be that exact thing you described. There's nothing wrong with having a fetish but it IS wrong to try to involve someone in it without their consent, especially things relating to control and humiliation. Whatever his reasons he's being straight up abusive so I don't think it's worth talking to him about it."
"Abuse is like a funhouse mirror. The grooming done to make you accept it warps everything, and people aren't really taught to recognize the beginning stages."
Tell you GF! Maybe there is a way she could go with her best friend or they could invite another relative. The sooner this is discussed the better - it's more likely that things can be arranged.
That was my instinct as well. He could be into another girl and looking for a reason to not be the bad guy who broke up. He could be questioning himself and want to have the freedom to explore and projecting. 
"Sit her down and tell her that you can no longer afford to support her. Tell her that you are going to look into moving into a one bedroom apartment because you cannot afford a two bedroom and supporting her.

1. Stop buying her special food. If she wants it she can buy it herself. ""Sorry we can't afford it""
2. Stop being her nurse and driver. ""I'm sorry, I have to work tomorrow. I can't take you to the hospital. You should call an uber.""
3. STOP STOP STOP taking her on romantic evenings. While she's there once a week go out on a romantic date without her.

She is still in your house because its more comfy there than in her home. Make it less comfortable and she will move. Her upper middle class parents are in a far better position to take care of her than you are and she is actually their child not yours."
"First, make sure that your husband is on the same page as you. He should feel as strongly, or more strongly even, that supporting your parents isn't what you'll spend decades doing. The last thing you want is your mother going to him to get him to agree to letting her stay in one of your properties, since she knows you won't budge (but he might). So, you guys need to present a united front. Both of you should be able to say a strong, unequivocal 'No'. 

Your parents subsidizing your brother is their problem. Don't make it your own. Try not to let your bitterness affect your relationship with your brother. The unfairness is in the double standard between how your parents treat both of their children (and how they stole 50k from you too, apparently); your brother didn't do anything wrong towards you. So, any anger or bitterness should, rightly, be directed towards your parents and not him. Sure, he isn't make the wisest life decisions by the looks of things, but this isn't a slight against you in any way.

Be prepared (therapy can help, but others find that just preparing on their own or talking to their trusted friends is enough) for your mother's emotional manipulation to try to get you to let her stay in your property. She'll likely call you ungrateful and selfish, a bad daughter, she'll tell you how she'll go homeless, she'll stress all that she's ever done for you and how much you owe her etc. You can no doubt foresee how she'll phrase all of those arguments and attacks, right? First, you must harden your resolve. You must be strong and show no sign of changing your mind (or else she'll double down on her efforts to get you to sway). You must not cry or get flustered when she'll say those harsh things. You should simply say something like 'I am sorry that you feel this way. However, the matter with the property isn't up for discussion. You cannot stay there.' It is best if you don't engage and get into arguments. you won't actually convince her of anything; you'll just give her ammo by which to try to sway you. So shut down any attempt to discuss her staying at one of your properties without arguing, getting defensive, or showing emotional outbursts. 

The final step is to be ready to walk away. No matter what happens to them (or what they claim will happen to them!), you have to just let it be. It's not your responsibility to mop up decades of bad financial decisions."
"This is well beyond hysterically lashing out. This is her consciously articulating that she wished her husband had died. Every single time I lost a family, friend, or other loved one, I never remotely thought about wishing someone else I loved had died instead -- and I certainly didn't say it when they were seriously hurt in the hospital.

His family is only protecting him. "

It's not about an ""empty spot"" in his life.  It's about him wanting to get his rocks off with whores and not giving a shit about you.

"he's not the one. If you really wanted to be with this man until the day you die you wouldn't care if he tied a string around your finger while you stood in a pile of trash (absurd I know..but you get the picture). People may disagree, but I firmly believe that if you are with someone that long (6 years is a long time) and you made one request of what you want your engagement ring to be like (as long as its a reasonable request, and it sounds like yours was) and he ""forgets"" or messes that up, he doesn't really know you. Its possible he fell in love with this one particular ring and genuinely thought you'd love it too. But I don't tend to think thats what that is; you did go ring shopping ""like 20-30 times"" so it sounds more like he felt pressured, didn't put a lot of thought into it, and honestly wasn't really listening to what you wanted. My advice, move on"
"I'm sorry, it sounds like she has effectively broken up with you. I think you should accept that the relationship is over, and work on moving on. Even if it isn't her intention to break up, her not contacting you for weeks is cruel and only more damaging to your relationship. "

Does she date?  Have a normal social life?  

This is actually a known paraphilia.  You can look up ""Hybristophilia"" or ""Bonnie and Clyde Syndrome.""  There are a number of different possible psychological reasons, from wanting to save a fantasy version of the killer, to having an avoidant attachment style and fixating on men who they can never actually be with it real life.

"
"The reason that people don't like you putting the blame on yourself is because it is a textbook example of the abuser/victim dynamic. So it's very concerning from an outside point of view to see you exhibiting those behaviors.  To me, your husband sounds abusive, or at least he's exhibiting abusive behaviors. But I'm a stranger on the internet and don't know you and only have this one snapshot to go on. I can't imagine how hard it is to consider the possibility that someone you love is actually abusing you. So just know that support is always there if and when you decide you need it. And know these internet strangers have no agenda and only call it as they see it.  Only you can know what actually is, BUT please do seriously think about what others are observing and saying. "
"That is not even a question. Why would you want to date someone who is jealous of an *animal*? And even if you did get rid of the dogs, what hoop would you have to jump through next? If it wasn't the dogs, it'd be ""other women"" or some other bullshit."

You are living with a dad. Your partner should be your equal. Not someone trying to change you. And makes you feel bad when you're not meeting his expectations. If you marry him, this will be the **rest of your life**.



This is not a quirk, a new behavior or something you should explain away. **This is who he is**"
"Except that she is now his friend. Expecting them to change their perfectly normal and acceptable behavior is too much, IMO. OP needs to deal with his feelings, instead."
"&gt; he's been cheating on me.... since at least before we got married

&gt;everything was basically perfect when we got married.

Apparently not...?

You said you know he's been cheating on you, but he denies it. If you don't believe him and he refuses to admit what he's done, what future is there? There's no trust, nor any way to rebuild it. Gather your evidence and consult a lawyer."

She also might have not realized your romantic intentions until a little after she agreed. I know I've been dense in those types of situations before. 
"OP shouldn't sue her by himself, but the landlord should.  She caused an infestation that probably led to a couple of other apartments and halls being sprayed.  Give the landlord a copy of those journal pages and he will pursue it with a vengeance.  

Maybe it can all be tied up in a single court case?  Because OP did suffer loss of property, time and peace of mind."
"&gt;So, this has lead to a lot of situations where she and I will talk about our relationship problems with my best friend.

This is what jumped out at me. So not only is she spending tons of time with him, she's also airing all her problems with you to him. That's a sure-fire recipe for disaster, even if no cheating ever happens. "
"Well, for one, remove her ammunition by not living like a grown child and expecting her to take care of all of the household duties. If she's feeling like she's having to mother you, she's going to be looking for advice on that.

But she still needs to address this herself, not run to her parents. All that does is put them all ganging up against you, make you defensive, and make everything worse.

And again, don't fall into some trap where you think you're stuck with this. People run out on much bigger obligations than financial, for far fewer reasons. Don't let any of them feel like you owe them your continued presence. You can leave.  "
"Your husband needs to start being upfront with you. Just because you don't handle the money doesn't mean you should be completely in the dark about this. Arrange a marriage counselling appointment and get to the bottom of this, as well as set up a plan to do what you can for your son. He shouldn't have to suffer because his father is dodgy."

"Great point. I definitely share my enthusiasm to an extent, but maybe I could point out how happy I am with it as part of my sharing with them as well. Thank you for your reply."
"Yeah this is a good point. I think this would be especially disturbing for the girlfriend if she's any kind of ethnic minority or has people in her family or close friends who are (as most people would, right?!). OP doesn't mention this."
"Hey! I'm also raised southern Baptist! Vineyard now. I also have what I'd consider to be broadened views, since I grew up overseas and traveling, so I think we got some stuff in common!

Your husband has used you very badly. He cheated before he even asked you to marry him, so it's even worse that he went through with marrying you. Honestly, the marriage is based on a lie. He promised to be faithful to you while he was doing the opposite.

Jesus mentioned divorce several times in the new testament, and tended to say that remarrying after divorce was adultery. Meaning that when you marry someone, you are spiritually tied to them till one of you dues. But, in Matthew 19:9 for example, he adds ""unless his wife has been unfaithful"".

This is naturally taken as applying to husbands too, meaning that today, even in Southern Baptist circles, cheating is considered an acceptable reason for divorce.

There are some who say not. But then again there are people who basically make up rules to follow so they can feel more self righteous. No, Jesus would not have been drinking grape juice! He drank alcohol. I was hung up in alcohol for a long time. I was hung up on a lot of things, so I think I get how you feel.

I know you seem to be drifting away from religion altogether but even so, I hope this can help you let go of your guilt. The American church has a really toxic culture. Don't feel bad for getting away from this bad situation. You and your child deserve better. Children do not like seeing one parent mistreat the other, it's confusing and terrifying for them. Your child will be better off with functional Co parents rather than miserable married ones. Also! You have to take care of yourself if you want to be in good shape to take care of your child! I learned that myself when my baby was born. Basically child's needs&gt;parents wants. Child's wants &lt;parents needs. Parent needs vs child's needs... well, gotta just use your best judgement.

Sorry this turned out so long!"
"I've only had one UTI in my life and it was so long ago I don't remember. 

But I CAN tell you what yeast infections smell like to me: hot buttered bread. I can also smell bacterial vaginosis, trich, and somebody who eats waaay too much sugar. Interestingly enough sugar can change the balance of things down there and someone who eats too much sugar has a really vinegary scent. Like Tabasco without the hot. 

It's the worst in public bathrooms. Knowing more than I ever needed to know about the state of the stranger's reproductive tract in the stall next to me is pretty daunting. I try to pee at home instead. "
I didn't say she had to break up with them forever and never ever speak to them again. But you get the respect you earn. That's how life works. 
"Well, for starters, Facebook isn't a dating site. If someone messaged me over Facebook asking to go to dinner (or the dining hall), and I wasn't already good friends with them, I'd ignore them too. Plus, if I'm not interested in someone (and I feel like your desire for a girlfriend/relationship is something that people can immediately pick up on), I will also not humour them by continuing interacting with them when I know they expect more than I'm offering. Basically, they're not ""treating you"" in any way. Chances are they aren't interested.

You should get yourself on Tinder or something.

Keep in mind also that no one is owed a conversation. It sucks, but rejection is part of dating."
"I didnt realize that people really thought that two wrongs made a right.

Years later when you still have them and aren't benefiting yourself financially, they might actually appreciate you standing your ground so they have that memory of a beloved family member."
He wants a combination teddy bear/sex robot and nobody wants to be Girlfriend Care Bear.
"First, let me say she was rude to you.  I don't accept alcohol as an excuse.


Secondly, at this age, there is a LOT of subconscious comparison (and pressure) amongst girlfriends of who's married/engaged/single with no one in sight, who's got a kid vs girls having trouble getting pregnant vs have no one to have a kid with, and career-wise are we where we want to be.  


I'm not saying it's right. I'm just saying I noticed my friends and I all do this in our late 20s/early 30s.  We've calmed down now (late 30s now).   It feels like an unfortunate phase.


Going to the wedding or not - up to you.  But for now, put the friendship on the slow burner, and keep in occasional touch, and see how the friendship continues.  No need to drop her yet.  "
"My doctor's fine with my weight gain for now! Most of that has been in the third trimester, and the baby is actually a bit bigger than average. I was actually advised to limit my weight gain, as I have a family history of perinatal health issues associated with gaining too much. I'm gaining just over a pound a week right now, so I should be right where I need to be (20-25lbs up) when I deliver!

I probably do need to be more blunt...I'm just afraid of making him feel bad. "
Thanks for reading and helping affirm what I was leaning toward.
"I think, if I was in your wife's place, the worst part would be that the man isn't wrong (well, he was mostly wrong - but not entirely). 

&gt; My wife chimed in saying that it was hard to to keep a house clean with a new baby and that I'd been patient and helped out.
&gt; 
&gt; The acquaintance then looked at her and said, I'd been patient but then I still had an affair hadn't I

He's right - you weren't patient and helping out around the house. You were out fucking another woman while your wife was at home taking care of a newborn baby. 

I think in that moment your wife had genuinely kind of forgotten the affair, and maybe believed that everyone else had done the same. I'm guessing 5 or 6 years ago she *never* would have chimed in to use YOU as an example of a good husband to have with a newborn baby around. 

&gt; After I broke it off with my AP, she went and exposed the affair to everyone in our circle. She put up texts, photos etc of us and sent it to everyone on my friends list on FB including texts of me complaining about my wife especially around the bedroom stuff.

I can't imagine how humiliating that was for your wife. That's so much more damaging than just dealing with an affair privately. 

And just when she thought everyone had kind of forgotten about it, she had it thrown in her face that even now - 7 years later - people still vividly remember. 

That guy was a jerk and a dumbass. But I'd bet money that at least one other person at that table was thinking, ""*Wait, did she really just say that thingsareamess was a good husband after their daughter was born?*"" Everyone else was just too polite to say anything. 

I'm guessing that's what she's working through right now. It's the humiliation and the painful awareness that everyone still remembers every detail about what you said in those texts. It's feeling like she has to stay silent when certain topics of conversation come up, or feeling self-conscious when other people talk about relationship difficulties or gossip about someone's divorce. In a very real way, she's still paying for what you did. 

I don't know if you can make that better for her. My advice would just be to listen to what she needs. Understand that she might take her anger and frustration out on you. Try to be as patient and as flexible as you can (up to a point; infidelity does not mean a life sentence of misery and abuse). Most of all, give it time. 

"
"&gt; ""According to him""

This whole post is ""according to her"", but we're not questioning what she's saying, so why doesn't he get the same courtesy?"
"That's kind, I wasn't expecting that. I will consider it, thank you"
"OP, you're a special kind of stupid. Not the malicious or even spiteful kind. Sad. "
Yeah I think she will have some extended work days in the near future. 
This would definitely be something my wife and í would say to each other
Can you change the formatting? This is very difficult to read
"That's fair to an extent, but judging someone in their actions is fair. His girlfriend asked him to do something, said it was important. Her family had an event with a certain expectation of effort on his part. He refused, then half asked it. You aren't judging his clothes, the clothes aren't actually that important. It's what he's expressing through his clothes, which in this case is explicitly ""I only grudgingly give half a fuck and expect to be hailed as a conquering hero for my minimal effort."" Is totally fair to judge that. 

He's just being lazy and contrary and then trying to rationalize it. Ew. "
"This is a good plan. OP, would they allow you to do clubs or sports or internships that look good on college and scholarship applications? These might help you be more financially independent of them sooner, boost you socially, and keep you out of the house more, which I assume is preferable. "
"dude, if this is an actual phobia (not just a ""I'm not keen"") he's be out if his fucking mind to go on this trip- he could have a severe meltdown"
"Even if, intellectually, you know you are responsible for your own behavior as an adult, and that your childhood is not an excuse to behave badly, you're still treating ""being a slob"" like it's a genetic condition.  You are choosing to be a slob, you didn't just helplessly get assigned that trait at birth.  If you truly were willing to take responsibility for yourself, then you should be thinking of your lack of motivation to clean as a short-sighted choice to neglect chores because you'd rather get some instant gratification elsewhere.  Being a slob isn't an immutable aspect of your character, at least not at age 25.  You can make other choices when confronted with a pile of dishes."
"This is excellent advice! 

From the opposite perspective, I grew up only a 10 minute walk from the ocean and my first boat ride was when I was only 2 months old. I could not picture my life *without* the ocean and spending each summer going out on a boat because I see beauty in what the ocean has to offer. *However*, I do understand irrational fears and it is definitely too late to find a way to be capable of handling a cruise in the near future, so OP should speak to his girlfriend pronto.

In all seriousness, though, OP you should look into therapy to help overcome this fear or, at the very least, get to a point where you are comfortable enough to be *near* the ocean. As someone else commented, what about your future? Will you prevent those you love, such as your future wife &amp; children, from experiencing the ocean, an aquarium, or a boat ride because you're incapable of handling it yourself? I do not want you to think I am discounting your fear, but it can seriously limit your life in the future if you continue you to avoid it rather than seek help to manage it.

Edit: words :)"

Stop blaming your husband. You don't need anyone else's support or approval to set healthy boundaries for yourself.
"No, you were *technically* not misled. 

He planned on proposing *only ""to get you back""*, but now he has you back anyway without having to do that, so he doesn't need to. 


So, clearly he does not IN FACT want to marry you, just to hang on to you *on his terms*.

So yeah, dump. Because if you propose, or guilt him into proposing, he's not going into a marriage enthusiastically. Bad prognosis."
"Like I said, you really need to get therapy and find a way to stop that cycle. It's likely killed this relationship and it will kill future relationships as well."
"Why does that person have to justify their reproductive choices to you? They are presumably there expressing the pain of their infertility, their loss of the ability to create genetic offspring and to do what normal people's bodies do, and your response is to diminish their pain and tell them that they should just adopt.

Trust me when I tell you that every infertile person you ever meet has researched adoption in great detail, met with agencies, and assessed the pros and cons and if they aren't doing it, there's a reason. And that reason is none of your business and not yours to judge.

When is the last time you asked a fertile person why they don't adopt? As long as you ask them on a regular basis too, I don't have a problem with it. But don't go around informing infertile people that it's their duty to adopt the world's unwanted kids when they are morning the loss of their biological functions and the life they had pictured for themselves."

Not only do we already know she hates tattoos (no, she's not just jealous) but OP continuing to get tattoos without agreeing to cover any of them up is not a compromise and it's insulting to suggest as much. If she likes her tattoos, she can have them, but this patronizing bullcrap isn't going to help anyone. "

"So, your girlfriend used to be a prostitute. Yes, a prostitute: she had an explicit ""sex for money"" relationship. She can slap ""sugar baby"" or whatever euphemism she wants onto it, but at the end of the day, she was a prostitute.

Now, with that being said, there's nothing inherently wrong with being a prostitue if that was her choice. But it might mean that the two of you are not going to be compatible in terms of what sex and intimacy mean in a relationship. Especially if you are one who feels that sex an intimacy are supposed to be used to build romantic connections rather than used as currency to get what you want from someone. "

It's not ordinary, but it's not completely unheard of. There could have been something he saw, something they went through, some reason that drew him to her that defies logic. If he is overall respectful and caring, and if you haven't heard stories about the relationship that sound as though he took advantage of her, then give him the benefit of the doubt. 

But you said you see him as a ""predator"" now. That's a strong word. Are there other hints that make you feel that way? Is he demeaning or controlling? Do you feel like he manipulates situations? Do you get the impression that he'd prefer you to be moldable or compliant? 

You're not wrong that it's unusual, but I think by itself it doesn't mean there is something wrong. "

"Hi there. Something similar happened to me. To be honest, this will break your trust. You will worry now about everything he does, who is is with, who he is talking too. If he can't talk to you but can talk to his x, I would say it's time to break up. There's no future if you can't trust and talk to each other. Probably not what you want to hear, but it's true. He also has no right to tell you when you should be 'over something'. Be easy with yourself and take care. Keep yourself busy. "
"You keep saying that, but it still isn't true AT ALL legally."
"There's actually a website that can estimate how long it is. I can't link here, but there's a site that can estimate the length of a speech, and apparently at an average of 130 wpm, the speech will take 12.3 minutes. (Cry breaks not included in that number.)

I did something similar to what you did once under a MUCH lighter set of circumstances and the person never spoke to me again. People get really touchy about being edited, especially without their pre-consent, and if she's already inclined to go off...it's like a perfect drama bomb.

I think setting a time limit is the best bet, as long as you're upholding it consistently. You gotta think about the other 100+ people who don't want to be stuck there for hours while your aunt tells your mom's life story AGAIN.

Take heart, though. You're trying to do your best in an incredibly shitty situation. Bullshit like this always happens when emotions are running high, like at weddings and funerals. She should be showing some understanding too here."

"&gt; There was also a mix-up quite a few years ago, and they received about 50k that was supposed to be for me.

If they didn't give it back, it's theft. However she describes it, that is theft. Someone else receiving money intended for you and not giving it back is not a ""donation"" or anything.

And unless you personally had **agreed** with your parents that the money **you** worked hours for would go to them, you were also stolen from."
"Hey pal, just wanted to let you know that you used the wrong ""there"" on your first bullet point 8 words in. It's actually supposed to be ""their"". Also, I couldn't read this post without a snooty Victorian accent, your comments don't seem to be much better. Is it possible they're ostracizing you for being so far up your own ass? Try cutting the shit and talking to them casually without fluffing your language like you did here. Also, do you show how much you hate them drinking when you hang out? If so, that could be another reason they don't like you."
"She reports to you, you need to correct her as things come up.

You can't say, ""you're annoying, cut it out,"" but you need to start saying things like, ""the office will run better if you can keep your voice down a little bit,"" etc. Correct her diplomatically and explain she needs to do things a certain way for the good of the company or the good of the project.

Whoa. He's allowed to own condoms. You've only been dating five months. I have a box in my closet from before my bf and we've been dating almost two years.

"Funny you say that.  We actually had this guy friend who had a girlfriend in another city.  And while my friend refused to talk to me for a half of a year because of what I did, she had no problem banging the mutual guy friend for over a year while consistently dissing the girlfriend every chance she got.  True definition of a hypocrite.  "
"Your mother is co-dependent and has issues she refuses to deal with. You're not a monster for being emotionally exhausted from dealing with someone who is very draining on your emotions, you're just tired.

If she's not willing to go to therapy and get better, then you pretty much have two options: Cut off her completely or accept it's going to continue and just try and deal.

You don't strike me as willing to do the former, so here's so things to help with the latter.

Remember that SHE needs you. You control the level of contact you have with her. If she calls you and you don't want to talk to her, you don't HAVE to talk to her. Call her back when you do want to talk to her.

And don't explain why you didn't answer. It's none of her business WHAT you were doing. You're an adult. Doing adult things. You'll call her back on your own time when/if you want. If it's urgent, she can leave a message and/or call Emergency Services who will then contact you. 

She will guilt trip you. She will repeat herself. She will call you 15 times in a single day because she can't find things and meanwhile you're just trying to live your damn life...

Those are things that WILL happen. Accept that they will happen.

You cannot control HER, but you can control YOUR reaction to HER."

"First, get out of the mentality that these girls are turning you down because of your race. That's nothing you can change, and it's a self defeating attitude.

What can you do to increase your chances: Working out, getting into a good college/being smart/having potential, having a lot of friends, having cool hobbies, wearing nice clothing, smiling more, being funny. 

How have you been approaching these girls? You might need to modify your attitude/tone, or get to know the girls a little better. It's very difficult to ask people out cold. 

Also, never ask ""why"" someone turns you down. Just accept their answer. It smells desperate! "
"You also need to work on a healthy mind. I can't diagnose you so grain of salt here, but as someone with a disordered eating history, you don't just ""experience the symptoms of an eating disorder,"" you HAVE an eating disorder. It sounds like you are trying to rationalize a lot of unhealthy behavior. You were 95 lbs because your mirror was warped and you didn't have a scale? No, you were 95 lbs because there are some distorted thought patterns you fell into that you need to work out in therapy. It's one thing to be healthy in the body but you have quite a bit of work to do to get healthy in the mind. "
"Even if they look alike it's not necessarily the case, there are a lot of cases of people randomly looking similar, or even of looking similar enough to their spouses that people mistake them for siblings.

Putting that aside though, the more important question is - what benefit would there be to knowing for sure?  Do you have any reason to think your husband is cheating on you NOW? If he actually had slept with your sister once fourteen years ago and never since, would that be the end of things for you? And if so, would you want to know that and leave him? Would you ever be able to interact with your nephew again, if his existence destroyed your marriage? Is this rabbit hole actually worth going down?

Let me reiterate that I do not believe there is necessarily anything going on just because of a resemblance. Those things do happen. I can understand why you see it as a possibility, but it isn't necessarily so."

No, it's the *not* walking away that you're going to regret, after wasting many more years."

"I've already posted but I just wanted to say that her not bringing it up again isn't necessarily a good sign.  Why?  Because she doesn't need to.  She already has you in a tailspin reassessing everything about yourself.  A good bully knows when they've scored a hit and to wait for the next one.  

The aim of the game with abusers isn't a knockout.  It's to keep people reeling and doubting.  This way the abuser can project their version of reality onto their target.

Maybe this woman isn't a bully/abuser.  Maybe you're right.  Just keep an eye out for more needling remarks."

"I came in here expecting him to be telling you sheepishly about the kind of person he used to be, but he stands by this?? That's gross.

I think you need to be asking yourself three big questions:

*What kind of person has requirements like that and still defends it? He says he's not that guy anymore but like you said, he's still bragging about it. His actions do not match his words.

*Why in the world would he tell you this? What do you think his motivations are? What does that say about him? My two theories are 1) trying to make himself look cool (""I'm so hot and awesome that I can be incredibly picky, look at me Mr. Sex God"") or 2) Trying to subtly make you feel insecure about your place in the relationship

*Can you be with the person who has revealed themselves with this information? It's three months in. Most people reveal their unsavory personality traits after a long time. He has no problem showing you this upfront.

When someone tells you who they are, believe them. In a way it's somewhat of a gift. You know this upfront and can make an informed decision about whether this is the right guy for you. My thought is he is absolutely not, but that's your call. That skin crawling feeling that his words gave you are your gut telling you this is not as great a guy as you thought he was."
"At 27 he should be secure enough in his identity that frat/industry culture should not dictate his choices. I would understand at 21 - Not at 27.

This is a smokescreen. He does it for two reasons. 

1) He likes it

2) He has a partner that puts up with it.

You can't do anything about removing the first reason, but you sure as shit can take away the second.

If it sounded like he wanted help, I would encourage you to have a discussion about rehab and support him, but let's be serious. This is a 5 month relationship in which you haven't been treated well for the majority of it. If you are having trouble dropping the mic on this one, you should see a counsellor to deal with some heavy duty self esteem issues.

"
"5 months in and you're already planning on how to save his sinking ship when he doesn't even want it saved....girl, you are gonna have a rough and heartbreaking wake up call. I'm sure you really care about this guy, maybe even love him. But honestly how little do you value yourself that you are still attracted to someone who doesn't respond to your ""no"" regarding sex, and who has a bloody nose due to cocaine use in public? 

I mean really. Seriously. Do you really think you're worth so little that this is what you deserve in life? I mean you're not a naive 20 year old smitten in her first relationship. You're 26. You're a grown mature adult woman, with an education, a career, and a future ahead of her. And you can still bring yourself to feel romantically about a guy you've known less than a year who basically tries to rape you (sorry, you weren't specific but not respecting your ""no"" is indeed attempted rape in my book, because it's happened to me and I know how it feels) and is a drug addict ruining his life with this shit storm? 

I know it sounds cruel to say just dump him, he obviously needs help and you care about him. I get it. But you are going to get way too entangled in this clusterfuck, and he's not the one who will end up hurt. He doesn't care! He is an addict, so he doesn't care how all this affects you and his family and friends. YOU are the one doing all the labor--asking for help for him, coming up with things to do that don't involve alcohol, etc. 

If an addict is going to get better, the desire to get help MUST MUST MUST absolutely 100% come from THEM. THEY must reach out for help. This WILL NOT WORK with you doing the emotional labor and heavy lifting. 

To get better, he's going to have to hit rock bottom. And maybe losing out on a great relationship is a way to help him see how destructive his drinking and drug problem is, and motivate him to seek help. You cannot save him. 

If he doesn't believe he has an issue, he WILL relapse. And he WILL try to manipulate you and justify why you should stay with him. It is NOT easy to walk away from someone when they are ""trying so hard"", and ""need you in their life"".

I think you are kidding yourself. I think you're in denial just as much as he is regarding the reality of this situation and how difficult it's going to be to do what you're attempting to do. 

You do realize that part of recovery IS relapse, right? So what if he's good for 6 months and then has a relapse? Relapses don't often last for just like one night. Relapse can be a week-long bender when you find them in the gutter of skid row before they recommit to sobriety. I think you are being incredibly naive about how difficult, emotional, gritty, and ugly recovery can be. Will you leave him 6 months from now? What if it is a ""just one night"" thing? What if it's in a year? 

You can't just say, ""I'll leave you if you drink again"" or whatever. That's kind of a vacuous statement. Relapse is part of recovery. It WILL happen. And you have no idea when and what the circumstances will be. Basically you're setting a boundary that has no clear definition and is putting you in a really risky position emotionally. 

If he is going to get better, he needs to do it ON HIS OWN, not with you babysitting him."
"Damn. You're right. After reading over responses here, I talked this over with my partner, and yeah - the problem is me. Not her at all.

She's always been pretty far advanced in front of me in pretty much everything (university, commitment to what she wants) except (ironically) short term planning and career. 

Thanks for the response. Looks like I've got to decide what I want in terms of kids pretty soon."
That's the first thing I thought of when I saw the post. She can send a text or an email for that though.
"Yeah this is the best advice imo. Nobody commenting who's telling OP to cut her out know what's happened and are speculating, OP is at least owed an explanation to see what actually happened. If it did turn out she just up and left him for something unreasonable, he can block her then."
Op is there a possibility that he's been blocked from your side? I've done a lot of blocking before and weather your the one doing the blocking for being blocked it often looks the same. Check your phones block list and make sure your mom isn't the one who blocked him.

Dude you're not very smart. Why are you in a relationship with someone else if you're going to continue talking to your ex and then lie about it? There's nothing wrong with remaining friends with an ex but the fact that you're lying about it and you went through that much to cover your tracks makes it seem like you have more to hide then just talking to an ex. You need to be honest with your girlfriend and let her decide whether this is something she can let go. 
"&gt;He sometimes likes to pick out my clothes for me.

This is not normal. If you are okay with it, okay, but it really shows how insanely controlling he is.

&gt;He tells me that if I had bigger boobs I'd be ""100% perfect"". 

What an asshole. Why are you with someone who controls you, doesn't appreciate you, and wants you to change for him? "
I'd  also look into legal aspects as well while you wait for your bro to turn 18. I know it seems extreme but this lady is vindictive enough to go down without  a fight. 
"Your soon to be SIL stepped out of line when she made that request of you. She can request her bridesmaids and mom to stay with her in her house and disallow the groom at her own house but she has no place planning what the grooms side is going to do/where to go. That is up to the groom. The groom has choices. He can rent a hotel for the groom's crew, stay at his parents house or if you and your husband agree, they can stay at your house but no one has the right to ask that you yourself not be there save your husband (although that would be another issue).  "

It doesn't matter that you won't be mean to them, if you don't like children why would she want you around her kids? If you're dating a mom then at some point you're going to interact with her children."
"Maybe that was more one way then she is letting on. Maybe he took the calls but never was never really as invested as she was. But i mean i know people in my life who think we are better friends then we really are because of how i am normally. Im not really invested in most of the people i talk to.

"And is that okay? No man I've dated has ever so much as escalated to yelling at me, much less laying hands on me. We've certainly gotten very stressed out and argued, but my current partner of some time- he once said something *dismissive* to me in an argument, realized it, and immediately repeatedly apologized and almost cried. I don't know if I would stay with him if he grabbed me by the hair (in a non-consenting situation), but I know the man I love would be horrified and ashamed and in tears afterwards.

'I don't think he'll kill me' is no standard to hold your partner to. You have the rest of your life to live without exposing yourself to people for whom the thought of rough-handling you would even occur."
This is so true OP. The moment she text the ex BF to meet up (completely SOBER) was the moment she cheated in my book. She knew exactly what she was doing. 
"I was pretty shocked at the part where you said he started screaming when you all were in the car. 

My thought was, ""Wait... What the hell? He was IN THE CAR!? How was he in the car!? WHY was he in the car!?""

Do you get what I'm saying? Be his friend or don't, police his drinking or don't... But in general, a good life rule is that when someone starts violently aggressively screaming at you, you don't bloody stay!! "
Your girlfriend is 100% right. Why are you friends with someone that knowingly helped Sarah's boyfriend cheat on Emily for a year? That's awful.

"I've been very tired and worn out lately due to my job. Depression has also been inching it's way back into my life due to various stressful issues that I've been confronting. It all got to me finally and I sobbed the other night in front of my boyfriend just to relieve some pent up tension and sadness. He comforted me and I got a good night's rest in order to recover. Yesterday, we went and purchased a birthday present for his mother at an upscale salon. I remarked in the car that I had ""never really spent money like that on myself, much less anyone else. That's a strange feeling. I might treat myself to a spa massage if I make the money in tips eventually"" since that sounded incredibly relaxing and refreshing.

 I went home and he went back to his scheduled daily errands while I took a nap and read a book. He told me he would be a bit longer than usual getting home. When he finally came home, he took a gift certificate out of his pocket from the salon for an hour long massage. I just cried. I hugged him and sobbed for 5 minutes. He cried and hugged me back. I've never had someone invest that much consideration into a gift. I can't even explain how much he means to me and how much I appreciate his tireless efforts and love no matter what's happening in our daily lives. I hope I return all of that gratitude in every way. I hope he will see just how much I love him.  "
Not yet but I get to see her tomorrow so maybe she'll have some insight. This flipping off part literally just happened to me the other day and it was freaking me out so much that I felt like I needed to vent about it somewhere in order to cope with my anxiety. 
"I vote for depressed too.  Encourage her to volunteer more, hit the gym (which also helps improve mood), join more groups, take new classes.  If she is happier, she'll also have more energy and pay more attention to her appearance.

Was she hoping to have children when she quit her job?  If so, that may be contributing to the depression.  "
"&gt;so we agreed she needs to pay her own way from now on and pay rent by X date or move out

Sooo... she's not moving out? Is that what I'm reading? I thought that's what you wanted from your original post. Do you not want her to move out? Did you discuss that you will no longer be acting as her mommy and doing her laundry and driving her everywhere and cooking her food and and running her errands?

Good for you for communicating with her, but it sounds like you flip flopped on what you wanted and are still trying to placate her and being too nice. You got halfway there and then backtracked and gave in. It doesn't sound like you communicated the real issues here, it sounds like you just talked to her about money. You're still being a doormat and you need have a conversation with her about all of it."
"Nordstrom is great too if you have the budget.  Honestly, be honest with her.  Let her know you love her but you think that she may be coming on to strong.  It sounds like your relationship is loving and strong. If my husband said something like that to me I'd obviously be a bit hurt but I also know that he says it out of love.  The other night I caked to much makeup on my face and he very lovingly went ""you put to much makeup on.""  (it really was a lot.)   
"
"I had a small feeling this might be a more personal issue since I feel I'm being irrational. I will try and seek help and try to fix myself, become comfortable with myself so I don't drag him down with me. Thank you for this. "
"Well, OP got it pre-approved.  And $100 is a lot more to some people than others."
"That request is ridiculous. You are not even earning $23k but if you were that would be 3 days work for a couple hours. You are a student, you cannot afford that. 


You are not greedy or selfish you are rational."
"Yes! That's perfect and validating to hear. Thank you. What would the ultimatum look like though? If you flick me one more time, I'm never speaking to you again? What if I can tell it's an accident? Just stick to it anyway, and cut ties? Do you think I should do that in therapy? We're going to one more..."
I just hope they give it to him without a fuss. Just to be safe I'd ring them again and explain that your boyfriend (and give his name and description) will be picking it up at specified time. Weird they didn't find *any* bracelet until you provided a description then poof it was found. Makes me wonder if someone was reluctant to give it up and wanted it for themselves or something. In any case I'm glad it all worked out!

"That's a bold claim. Having been in an emotionally abusive relationship myself, it's incredibly easy to justify it to yourself even when you know something's wrong. It doesn't mean common sense is lacking (well, in some posts), just that we're human and emotions make you do fucky things. "
"&gt; I need to start it in a more positive way so she doesn't immediatly get scared or panicky

This sounds like insecurity. Has she said or done anything else to indicate that she feels insecure about the relationship? Because people who are secure tend to be more willing to have hard discussions, whereas insecurity breeds avoidance. Maybe you could start the conversation with something like ""I want to say something out of love for you and the desire to have a better relationship."" Then go into whatever the topic is, like your wanting to have better communication with her.  
  
Give the new phrases a shot. If it's still devolving into crying and dismissing from her, then she's probably not be ready for that kind of mature discussion.  "
They aren't flirting with him. They're serving him food. 
"Yes, but he's going to introduce himself that way. 

What is your husband's reason why this is bad? What are the consequences?c"
"It sounds like the agreement will be drawn up with legal assistance but make very sure it circumvents the local laws regarding common law marriage/defacto partnerships.  I have a few friends who were burned.

As for buying... would you be able to buy and then rent it out?  Assuming the income covers the rent, you could build equity while remaining in an area acceptable to your boyfriend.  In a few years, if you marry, you can sell and use that money for a new place."
"I'm a teacher who was told by a parent not to call her son by the name he introduced himself as. She 
Wanted him to go by his first name and he liked his middle name. It became super awkward. The kid would be visibly upset whenever school officials called him by his ""correct"" name. Teachers felt super weird because they had a positive relationship with the kid but the parents were basically poisoning that relationship. Plus what do I do when he corrects me and tells me to call him by his middle name? Do I say ""I can't call you that."" Or ""That's not your name."" His parents had really messed up his identity and self esteem. Other kids pick up on it too. He was super resentful of his parents. 

This kid was 16 not 4 but I still think it's important to let a kid be who they want. If this attitude continues with your husband to more important things in the future your kid could end up resentful. "
"&gt;  He just doesn't see it that way.

Well that's convenient. If he doesn't see it that way, that's a perfect excuse to choose watching TV over ever celebrating anything. Frankly, I think his attitude and lack of excitement is a subtle way, that will continue to grow, to downplay your achievements. 

Is he also the kind of guy who opts out of birthdays/ celebrations/ anniversaries because they're about corporate greed, or he doesn't get 'why we have to go out *that* day,' or it's silly, or some other POV that basically absolves him of effort? "
"It would make me anxious, uncomfortable, jealous and for no helpful reason."
"Sure, she can be sad, but it's immature as hell to take it out on him. I'm honestly baffled that someone her age can be so emotionally immature that the mere fact that her boyfriend has had past relationships makes her cry and refuse to talk things out. 

If I were OP, I would let her know that I can sympathize, but nothing in the world is going to change the past, and I won't be sorry for existing before I met her. This approaches deal breaker territory for me, depending on how she follows up. "
"My guess is he felt shitty, he saw an opening to make himself feel awesome and powerful and went for it.

Also, if he's upset about the house not being clean - hire a cleaner! Or do it yourself! Don't just whine about how things have changed since the baby came along. "
This is so incredibly thoughtful and supportive. Awesome way to reassure her that OP is on her side. 
"There's other really good advice here already, I just wanted to say that I went out with someone who had a very acute sense of smell and I often found it - in small ways - really hurt my feelings and made me feel acutely self-conscious. 

If my clean laundry had a moderately damp smell from drying too slowly he would get weird about hugging me, and sort of pick at my clothes. Sometimes we'd be in my house and if something smelt a bit off, he would wrinkle his nose and look disgustedly around my house. And one a couple of occasions, when we were walking down the street - in the wide open air - and I started my period, he would immediately smell it and, well, judge me.

I am a clean person, but he made me feel like I was disgusting, or like I don't have good personal hygiene standards, which isn't true. Perhaps that's how your boyfriend feels sometimes, that your comments are an implicit reflection on his way of living."
I'd have called his ass out on that shit.
"No way, they had just gotten married like 6 months prior to the start of my freshman year, and it would have spread like wildfire. Plus she knew she'd literally go to prison if she didn't report it lol."

"I'm sorry to say this but unless you are so disabled that you can't work, you should get a job :(

Think about it, your son is 12. He will need money in 6 years for school. Your husband hasn't saved a cent?

Your son would be better off if you worked, collected child support from his father, and put that support in a fund to help him when he's older.

Why split from him? Because he refuses to tell you where the money went. It went somewhere. What is he spending it on? Not you, not your son, or else you would know. 

He has some sort of secret life or secret addiction that he is putting above you and your son. You are one disaster away from being in a calamity, and he's a LAWYER. There is no reason for that to be the case."

I mean, if you're feeling sexually harassed or very uncomfortable and want to have a straightforward conversation about your working conditions that is valid. But otherwise take it as lesson learned and stay away from creeps who flirt and send you sexy texts when they are engaged.
