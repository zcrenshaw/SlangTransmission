The law disagrees.
"Literally illegal and dangerous to do that. So uh, thanks for making the problem worse?"
"Me when trying to pay for something with paypal instead of just typing in credit card info:

&gt;Oh I can just pay with PayPal.

#

&gt;*Click on PayPal*

#

&gt;The fuck was my password?

#

&gt;*Tries several different passwords*

#

&gt;Wait, what was my username... Does it use username or email? Wait, which email did I use?

#

&gt;*Tries a sequence of usernames and email addresses with a combination of various passwords.*

#

&gt;Fuck it. I'll just log into the paypal site and do recovery.

#

&gt;*Goes to paypal site*

#

&gt;GAH, I hate doing these things on my fucking phone. It's so obtuse. Fine, I'll get up and use my computer.

#

&gt;*Gets up, and goes to PayPal website on computer*

#

&gt;*Goes through recovery process*

#

&gt;*Logs into paypal*

#

&gt;Oh fuck, yeah, my card's out of date now. I need to do that.

#

&gt;*Gets rid of old card in system. Puts new card in.*

#

&gt;*Go back to original website I wanted to use paypal for*

#

&gt;*Get back to payment point, and pay using paypal*

#

&gt;Fuck, this is why I never use PayPal.

#

&gt;*Forget PayPal credentials again, because it's faster just to type in my credit card info, which I do actually have memorized, and PayPal's just an intermediary to my credit card anyway.*

#

&gt;*Repeat all steps next time I decide to ""just"" pay for something with PayPal.*"
"Dear sir, 
    
I wish to tell you a tale. 
It is not pertinent to the matter at hand but it is however very interesting indeed.    
    
There is a man called bradley. 
And a woman who hums. 
Another woman shrouded in delicious darkness and more to come.  

Two of them i have never seen and the other is a complicated case.       
But they do share the same place    
 in my mind.       

Let me explain.    
Parents have a place in your mind.    
Just like your friends do.   
Friends from work and friends from school. Friends from a certain group. 
Your choice of words changes depending on the friends you're with.   
I have a theory that your thought patterns change too.   

Anyway now we've set the stage the story can begin.   
These people are not connected by rhyme or reason.   
Only in what they do to me.   
     
I consider myself an artist of sorts. 
It's an egocentric way of describing oneself but it's the thought that counts.  
Sometimes i am spurred by someone or something and an artistic voyage begins.  
These people i have mentioned before are those who fire me up.  
Smoky clouds of breath escape my nostrils and indeed a fire has been lit.  
Puffs of smoke reveal my determination.  
I would like to draw the screen and show you Sisyphus.   
I don't take his name in vein because it is deliriously sweet.  
He is what i never was, determined to get the bloody rock on the bloody mountain.    
However my determination is oriented otherwise.    
Towards the way to tell a story.   
I wouldn't like to say i am *as* determined as our sweet boy, the greek fellow.   
But i like to pretend to.   
Isn't that what we all do.     
    
The game of life is a game of pretend. 
Actors on the stage are more true to themselves than any man walking the stage of this barren place.  
Resources so abundant yet the treacherous ways of man have never been so throbbingly clear. (The more observant would see the vein of need and lust pulsing through the very actions we take everyday. It's judt being honest)  

You noble unknown man or woman or dog.  Let's not forget the option of an intellectual dog that somehow came upon the idea to interact with this meandering Maelstrom of hive mentality.  
You, you have no need or want that obfuscates your sight. 
Only the need to read upon the mysterious nature of this message. 
Oh the french say it so beautifully  
Message.  
Sounds like massage. 
I believe them to be equally glorious in nature.   

I have all met these people through messages.  
Each one a story worth telling. 
Each message a sum of their experiences and mine, culminating into a living being itself.    
And they have showed me the way of their mind and have showed them.    
I find it is of the utmost importance i find more.  
I have decided in one of these messages to call them colour makers.

I have not met you so to speak but i have indeed found you here.   
And your message annoyed me actually.    
I was expecting something else.    
Yet you spurred me somehow.   
    
Only you have received this.   
What happens now is the freedom of your choice.   
The call of the unknown.  
Perhaps a question mark.  
Probably.  

A nice day. 

(Why? I have studies to procrastinate. That's one question mark gone.)

"Overpopulation is a serious concern.

GMOs are a bad thing.

Solar, wind and hydroelectricity are easy to implement renewable energy sources that should be commonplace everywhere.

Legalizing prostitution would make the sex industry safer.

I don't view ignorance as a bad thing. It just means you don't know yet due to information constraints. It's most likely caused by the enviroment and people around you, so as such, it's hard to judge an individual person on their ignorance.

Feel free to ask about any one of my points."
"Wow. You are extremely naive. The most commonly stolen item in grocery stores is alcohol. That's not a basic need. It used to be cigarettes but those are more tightly controlled now. That's not a basic need either. 

America isn't Les Miserables. People aren't stealing bread to survive. They steal electronics and beer. "
That white privilege doesn't exist.
"I wouldn't know.  I'm a white female. And let's just point out how stupid you are because this is fun.  First of all, the topic asks what a view is only expressed by ignorant people.  I posted my thoughts on that based on my personal experience and also by common sense.  No where does my post indicate that every single white American thinks that.  And thirdly, how did I stereotype black Americans?"
"Also all of your freedoms, the right to choose your own life path, the right to dissent, the right to benefit from your own efforts. And you also stand to lose a good portion of your skull the day they decide to smash it open with an ice pick. I guess what you get in exchange is crushing misery, poverty and a lot of boiled cabbage. "

"Yep, that's the point of this thread. +1 Autism for you"
That's why you downvote anything that praises trump be it hard facts too.

But matter is substance. Energy is a non-substance that is found inside of matter.

"Trust me the day America adopts a non interventionist policy towards the ME is the day that America will stop being worried by any possible threat from the ME... Deep running sectarian conflicts? Lebanon had a civil war over sectarian issues but believe or not ( not that I really care) today's sectarian tensions are much higher than it was during the civil war or even 8 years ago... Corrupt yes, ill functioning perhaps but at least we had stability and security.. 
And yes you condescending jerk, we had a trash crisis because when your country's population increasws by roughly 40% in less than 5 years because of the refugees, well our infrastructures couldn't handle it...."

"That's probably the best choice. I think today, his race wasn't an issue. But 50 years ago? Yeah... he wouldn't have done well."
"What ???                  
You mean like how he was part of a roast of himself . Not to mention all the times he joked around with the press and on TV before he ran for POTUS ..                          
People forget what he was like before hand or what ? Jesus he's not some crazed nut who's just going nuke the world . Fucking people need to calm the F down already .

Long time Christian here; I *truly* hate to see people joking about this kind of thing. It doesn't do the Lord justice.
"Pulling out is free bro, and its 96% effective if you're not a moron. The rest I'll let stand."
you sound like a SJW
"Dream on, mentally ill person."
Why? Lol that's litterally her job. If she didn't want people recognizing her than she probably shouldn't be shoving a vibrator up her ass for the whole world to see. The double standard is huge.

"That healthcare also fucked over countless people, who could then NOT. afford healthcare. And the fact that Obama refused to denounce, and even use the words ""islamic terrorist."" Makes it that much worse."

IMO none of them were but the one closest to the left was Stein. I understand voting for Clinton if you're in a swing state but you can't call yourself a leftist if you are a Clinton supporter.
pic proof required.
"Stubble is ok and even the winter time personal maintenance takes a slide those are ok. But when you can tell the girl never trimmed in her life and her pubes are 2 and 3 inches in length you have a talk.

Oh man I was with this Jewish girl for a bit and we get to the point where we wanted to bang. Jewish girl so remember they are fair skinned from being inside the bank all day they usually dont have any color. I take her panties off and this assortment of color and tones is burnt into my mind like a body inside an oven. Her pasty white skin, her black, long and out of control pubic hair which went almost all the way up to her belly button, and crimson red almost purple pussy. It smelled nice and was crazy tight. But like all good cooks say you eat with your eyes. I did. Same for Fucking I couldn't get past the pasty skin ash black pubes to save my life. And her clam hiding out in there like it was an attic saying come catch me! Tra la la la la. Awful."
Aaand of course I get downvoted because people love their delusions. 
Doggy Style. Even when freshly cleaned there's still the lingering butthole smell.
Every fucking character from the Netflix series. Holy fuck.

"I don't trust any 100% , but some are more trustworthy than others, you can never be 100% , but in the act of looking for truth you come across the sources that are so obviously biased like CNN, Politico , that once you filter those sources out , the ones you have left are a good indication for truth.  That goes the other way too, the sources that are so obviously biased towards Trump.

Somewhere in the middle lies the truth. "
She didn't know that Pluto had its planet status revoked. 
"I have an excellent core. I love working out. In my mid 20's I realized fighting your body type was useless. Why did I care if I could bench 300 or have no neck? I hated the massive amounts of food and sleep I had to consume to keep my size up. So I realigned my goals and realized I was more of a Brad Pitt in Fight Club physique. At 5'10 155 lbs. I am healthier and happier than I have ever been.  I haven't sat down and looked at a giant plate of chicken and rice with dread in years. I'm 32 and have better abs, obliques and hip flexors than most 23 year old models. Don't fight who you are. Play to your strengths."
"Yes you are a racist. By actively supporting a racist who will implement racist, misogynistic, and xenophobic policies you are inherently all three. You can't claim not to be something that you actively support"
"What I find even more annoying is forcing a stalemate. I played a great game, I fucked you up in a majestic set of maneuvers. Give me my goddamn checkmate"
"Yet Obama actually moving troops into Poland to the Russian border to escalate things there, expelling diplomats, and wanting more sanctions on them, despite no proof of them doing anything  is not trying to start WW3 how? I am all for calling out bullshit, political figures need to be challenged but this making a mountain out of a mole hill is not good for anything."
Because there are 60 genders.....I read it on buzzfeed. It must be true 
"I hated this movie, which is weird cause I like blades of glory and step brothers. Marky Mark just seemed so out of place and unfunny. Plus idiot Will Ferrell with fine ass Eva mendez didn't make sense"

I'm sure she's paraphrasing what the therapist said like most clients 
"She said they had sex a few times a week. I'd say in a relationship, that's acceptable implied consent. Yeah, maybe he should have made sure she was okay with the idea of wake-up sex beforehand, but let's be honest here it's not like he tied her to the bed and ball-gagged her and started going at her with a 14"" dildo. "

Honestly I still can't wrap my head around why you can't help them. 
Yeah but facts dont matter delete your post and give me karma
"Ok, if you were to BET $1000 on her being a productive member or society or not, which one would you really choose?"
Would you rather our kids get a shit education or would you rather we pay a bit more for actual teachers that aren't flunkies?
"gay marriage

edit: reddit neckbeards keep downvoting me please, you all lowkey dont want gay marriage anyway. hypocrites"
