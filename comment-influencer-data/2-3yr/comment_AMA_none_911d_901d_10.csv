"Worst was when I had a guy refuse to heal a dude, and the character who didn't get the heal died. Turned out one was Blood, the other Crip.

The gangs fought so hard over that that Bare Hill Correctional Facility was locked down for a week while the guards sorted it out. 

Imagine how I felt when I get called down to Investigations and the Sgt starts asking me who the fuck ""Baaalzor"" is and why he killed ""Grimme"". "
We made the local news in 2004. 
"Well, it came down to that. 

But the long version is: 

Grimme was almost dead. He needed a heal BAD. 

Baaalzor was the only healer. 

Baaalzor heals Trey instead of healing Grimme. 

Trey was nowhere near dead.

Baaalzor and Trey are members of the same gang. 

Accusations of favoritism are leveled against Baaalzor. 

The human who controls Grimme attacks the human who controls Baaalzor. 

Baaalzor has his gang get revenge. 

Revenge spawns more revenge. 

D&amp;D gets banned. "
This can't be real life.  Oh my god.
Would you like to absorb my credit rating too?
"I know this is your AMA, but I want to share something with you. 

I began talking to women and finally lost my virginity at an advanced age (I didn't quite make it to wizard status, but I was close). I feel like I should inform you of what the 'other' side is like after waiting an irregular amount of time to do these things. It might put some things into perspective for you.

1) I always thought I was too damaged to be around girls since I had avoided interaction with them for so long. I always felt that it had been too long and that I had missed my shot to finally *begin* talking to women, holding their hands, sharing a kiss, etc. This is not the case. I have learned that you are never too far-gone to begin talking to women or too far-gone to pursue a relationship if it's really something you want. I now know that conversational/flirting/social skills do not ever truly atrophy completely like I once thought; they just lie dormant waiting to be picked up and used should they be required by someone interested. Anyways, long and short of #1 is: You're not broken, though you might think you are.

2) This leads to the second thing I want to share with you. After a certain stage in life, when you are not quite on par with the expectations of society and your peers, you can feel extremely isolated, and alone, which can lead to a sort of fantasy life that you create. This fantasy life is one in which you envision what your life *could* be like if you could meet the expectations of society, and ""just do what everyone else does"". This was a huge concern for me back in the day, and I would spend far too much time thinking about a life that was not mine yet. This kind of thinking can become an obsession, so much so that it can wind up negatively impacting your attempts to coordinate your present life. I don't want to sound like a dick, but the fact that you wrote this AMA is indicative that you are caught up in a perception that what you *are* most basically is something abnormal, something that doesn't fit the mold of the current day. If you dwell with this thinking too much, you can do damage to yourself, as you run the risk of buying into the fantasy that life would be radically different if you weren't a virgin, and if you were able to be around girls.

3) This leads to my final point. Life on the other side is not as radically different, or 'other' as you likely think it is (as I also once thought it was). Having a sexually active life, and a life in which you can enjoy the company of women, is undoubtedly cool and fulfilling in its own right, but it's not like opening pandoras box or discovering something beautifully revelatory. The other side is much less movie-like, much less thematic... As vague as this description is, it does sort of get to the point: Once this aspect of your life opens up it strikes you as something that feels as though it was always there, or, rather, something that could have always been there - much less like planting a flag on the moon, and more like you're simply living your life now. What is radically different or 'other' of the 'other side' is the loss of societal stress. Once you start doing these things you start to feel less implicated in the narrative of abnormality, and with this change you start to see the complete bullshit that is attached to this aspect of life that freaks people out such as yourself and makes them feel bad about who they are. It's all horse-shit, as this aspect of life is not the be all end all of living: it's simply something we can or can not do. 

Anyways, since this is an AMA I guess i'll ask: How's your day been?"
We played the exact same game. We just called it Everquest. 
"The only time I've heard them make a noise is when I've been driving and they leap out at you from behind a tree in the middle of the night. Its a kind of thwack sound and me swearing loudly. Little bastards have nearly killed me 3 times. 

Have you seen what's in that pouch? It's like goo. Ew. Makes me nauseas just thinking about it. "
Would u like me to send you copies of my fingerprints as well?
Hey its me ur son i want to do it
The drapes are blonde but there's no carpet whatsoever. Does that disappoint you?
"Hurt feelings. Really the cause of any violence. If I kill your character that you spent the past 6 months building up, you might feel some kinda way. You might go pick up a shank. "
"Weed, heroin, sometimes coke. 

My chick would bring it on the visit. 

She hands me a loonie (balloon) with the drugs. I tie it to some floss that is tied around my incisor. I swallow the ""package"" and I puke it up on the cellblock. 

Some people boofed it (stuck it in their anus). "
"Prison saved my life. Not even a question. I was a piece of shit. Now I'm a good person. I'm so glad I got locked up, it's not even funny. "
"Where did you come from Cotton Eye Joe?
"
"...Wow.

&gt; D&amp;D gets banned. 

Heh. They will find another game to argue over. I mean Blood and Crip playing games together, how can that end well anyway."
"I was caught with around 400k USD in stolen property red-handed.  I was charged with 27 felony counts of burglary.  Although I didn't actually participate in the burglaries, I never went to court to plead my case.  I decided to join the French Foreign Legion which is a military that accepts anyone, no questions asked and gives you a new identity.  I did 6 months of that, realized it wasn't for me and AWOLed.

I live in a 5 bedroom house 500m from the beach.  I started a financial company dealing in foreign exchange investments.

I have to pay for it, although I have been fairly lucky so far not to have any health issues."
"I went in 2014 and it changed my life. Surviving 10 days in the desert relying only on what you brought and planned for goes a long way toward building confidence and character.

Craziest thing I saw, aside from the enormous pirate ship / nightclub built on a semi truck chassis driving through an endless dark desert, was the Temple. The Temple is this incredibly ornate wooden building that's rebuilt differently each year. [Pictures](https://www.google.com/search?q=burning+man+temple&amp;client=ms-android-att-us&amp;prmd=mivn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW4uzQnObSAhWljFQKHaORCi4Q_AUICCgC&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=559). You go inside and the walls and floors are covered with notes, photographs, mementos, little shrines, etc. Thousands of them. Most dedicated to loved ones who passed, a higher power, future or past selves, etc. The idea is to bring whatever emotional baggage you have there and part with it. On the last night the temple is burned along with everything in it.

The note on the wall that got me said ""I miss you so much and I hate you for choosing heroin over me. I love you"" - it was to someone who had overdosed. I went from party mode to realizing I was standing in a desert hundreds of miles from civilization, surrounded by an emotional outpouring of strangers. Everyone there was quiet, some were crying, but it didn't feel like a funeral or something. It wasn't morbid. It was empathy. I felt an intimate connection between the dozens of people there in the temple and the thousands of other burners who would come and go throughout the week. It was like everyone agreed and said ""Its okay. I know."" Defenses came down, inner pain came out, and the playing field was leveled. 

One of the major principles of Burning Man is ""Radical Acceptance"". That feeling of the temple was there through the rest of the festival. Everyone was able to be their truest self and all the games and social pressures fell away. After a week of being surrounded by radical acceptance you'd run into a complete stranger from a different walk of life and feel like you were family. I'm a ratty teenager from rural Pennsylvania, you're a high profile businesswoman, and he's a raver from Australia. In the normal world the closest any of us might get to each other is a passing glance, but here we're sitting on the ground having a heart to heart about the meaning of living. Status, gender, age, race and so on fell away and all that's left are humans leveling with each other and realizing we're more alike than not.

So, that was pretty crazy to see and experience. Craziest things I did were MDMA for the first time, spending six hours lost in a sand storm, and sitting in a circle with a bunch of strangers holding eye contact and not talking. Turns out if you and another person fight that impulse to look away after a few seconds of eye contact, some weird things start happening. Its surprisingly terrifying until you realize you're *both* feeling the awkwardness, and then you start to let down your walls and bond over it until its gone.

TL;DR - Came for the party, stayed for the new perspective on humanity, and I'll be going back as often as I can. "
I saw that post in a TIL two hours from now.
"Since you're using a fake name now what was your real name and what's the place you're staying in now like, is it also eastern block area?"
"Name is Chad, can't say it's ever even come up lol Tell your girl I said hello by the way"
Are you actually going to answer questions on your AMA?
"Nah. 
"
I'm sorry your life is hell.
Well I live an hour away from Melbourne so that's rural (no not outback) so probably a million and four things could attack me at any moment. Bright side I don't live in the outback where there's thirst and serial killers. Win some. Lose some.

"I do not recall! It felt like a deep sleep. I can tell you that when you're dying, you don't experience any feeling of panic or dread. It's pretty peaceful even if you're bleeding out from stab wounds"
"Have you avoided women on purpose, or just never met anyone it worked out with? "
Personally I'm not as committed to it as much as I think most men are but that's because I prefer actual sex and all that goes with it. It's a bit hard to pull my own hair when my hands are already busy. Still enjoy it though
"Yeah, sort of. It is WAY rarer than pop-culture makes it seem. We had enough gay dudes that anyone who wanted to fuck was able to get their rocks off. I saw one rape total in my whole time locked up. And it was more of a punishment for leaving the gang than a sex thing. "
"When I was arrested they confiscated my passport.  I drove many hours to one of the major cities that replace passports same day.  I was lucky that they hadn't had time to revoke it yet.  I crossed the Canadian border on foot, then flew to a Caribbean country where I caught a second flight to Europe.

My backup plan was to sneak across the Mexican border on foot and try to make my way to Argentina, where an ex-girlfriend lived.  Bad hombres sneaking OUT of the country lol what would Trump think about that?"
Way too specific- good luck finding anyone
"There is no statue of limitations once you have already been charged with the crime.  I would if I could, but not if it means living as a fugitive there or going to prison.  I have a pretty good life here."

No I was being dead serious. Your brain is concentrating so hard on surviving. It doesn't have time or energy to worry about having anxiety or being scared

"Hand drawn sheets. Magic Tape to make them last. 

Getting caught with one that said ""Dungeons and Dragons"" at the top got you 30 days in the hole. That's why we called it ""Everquest"". "
"I had sex with a 14 year old when I was 19. Her parents called the cops. 

I was also part of a robbery ring, but those charge were dropped in exchange for pleading guilty to the rape. 

Most fucked up thing is a tie. 

Dude braided a rope out of toilet paper and then tied it to the bars and his toilet. When the guards opened his cell, the door strangled him to death. 

Dude got his throat cut with a can top on the walkway back from Yard. He fouled a guy in a basketball game, and the guy who got fouled felt he deserved the death penalty for that. "

"It's a long conversation that usually comes up when they start to notice me saying no to a lot of foods I'm given or offered. There's a story behind it so I try to put off that conversation as long as possible, because they always look at me differently once they know. 

As for my SO, his younger brother possibly has an undiagnosed autism spectrum disorder and also had weird habits around food, so it wasn't a big deal to him. He's pretty used to it. Sometimes he finds parts of it endearing, like the fact that I eat the same dinner every single night."
"There are a lot of Russians and they survive best.  They are just fucking tough people.

I think Americans are generally accepted easier than most.  There is an extensive qualifying period, only 1 in about 13 actually make it to the farm (boot camp).  The rest are turned away.

There are a lot of refugees etc. who show up just looking for a better life but aren't really physically cut out for it.

I was surprised to meet quite a lot of Americans there.  Most are special forces military types who were either dishonorably discharged or were just bored and looking for the next adventure.  Most of those guys were completely fucking crazy.
"
"Ok. Here's the story. When I was somewhere around 18 months to 2 years old, I got tonsillitis pretty bad. Being so little, I didn't understand what was happening and I thought it was the *food* that was hurting my throat. So I refused to eat or drink anything because *extreme pain*. So I ended up in hospital for 2 weeks, fed by a drip.
Mum had to coax me to eat again by continually assuring me the food wasn't going to hurt my throat. ""It's nice and soft! Look how soft it is! It's nice soft milk, nice fluffy potatoes!""
So I would only eat those few ""soft"" foods I knew were safe. Mum kept feeding me those foods because it was easier than having to go through the process of convincing me to eat something unfamiliar (you know, on top of the other stresses of having two kids under 5). A few years went by and she resolved once again to introduce me to new foods. By then the idea of food hurting my throat had gone away but that reaction of fear was conditioned into me and triggered whenever I had to eat something unfamiliar. I had no idea why. I was too young to understand about nutrition or to be socially compelled to eat the same things as others, I had no reason to want to overcome it, I just wanted my ""nice and soft mashed potatoes"". Those things changed as soon as I was old enough to realize it was psychological and I wanted badly enough to be healthy and normal. That's when I finally started trying new foods of my own free will. Habits are very hard to break though. It's an ongoing battle. We all fall into routines. I just have to make a consistent effort to keep trying."
Fuckin assholes thought this was a ski in ski out service.
"In order to get nabbed in Europe, you have to be on the Interpol red list.  For Americans this is reserved for high profile crimes like murder.  They know that you don't have residency anywhere and most people would never find work/housing without residency so it's cheaper for them to wait and hope you get deported or give up.  If you don't then well you're not really their problem anymore.  

That being said, if they really want you they will get you, one way or another.  They can just ask the cops to turn you over to immigration and put you on a one way flight to the USA where a US Marshall will be waiting for your plane to arrive and arrest you on the spot.  

I don't think they are actively looking for me anymore, but there is no way to be sure.

I recently renounced my US Citizenship by walking into the Embassy and signing a declaration that I no longer wished to be a US Citizen.  They charged me over $1000 to do this, bastards..  I can only hope this will reduce their interest in me.  I was terrified walking into the Embassy but my lawyer assured me they didn't work like that.

At the moment I have a status of stateless, like Tom Hanks in Terminal."
What did you eat then? 
are you disappointed in the presidency so far?
"No doubt. If immediate family member dies, DO NOT go to the funeral. It gets em every time on I ALMOST GOT AWAY WITH IT"
"""a bit disappointed""....What could Trump do that would completely disappoint you?"
"I think it's a stupid rushed SJW law that didn't get enough thought put into. Of course I want to see transgender people on the protected people's act but ""gender identity"" is too vaugue, there should be a clear definition of what exactly that is, because right now anyone in Ontario can identify as any 'gender' they want AND demand to be called whatever pronouns they prefer, real or made up.    
So pretty much I can parade around saying my gender is ""Royalty"" and demand my pronouns to be ""your highness"", and I can press charges/get you fired/etc if you refuse to call me that. It's an immense violation of free speech."

I spent years on disability before I was able to grab my bootstraps and get back on my feet. 

When I left I cut all ties. I've never felt scared. They might come beat me up one day if they find me. I'm ok with that, and I have instructed my wife to not even call the cops if it happens. "
I saw that post in a TiL recently
"I am a happy atheist. My religion is science and my church is astronomy. I have found the peace and happiness that many church people say they find in Jesus when I look out to the universe and see just how small we are and how big it is.

Deep down inside I never personally believed in the idea of sin, or living a life of sin. Instead I believe in treating others with kindness and of course the golden rule. However it was only after I left the church that I realized that I felt that way and was able to express it.

Sin to me is a way to control members of the church by setting man made rules on what we should or should not be ashamed of.

I try to be respectful of everyone's religious preferences even though I don't have one, however my only concern is when church's tell us that people that are different from us as less than us, or that they will go to hell. That dehumanizes them and sows seeds of discord that can eventually become racism, homophobia or outright malice. That I don't agree with."
What were the circumstances around you being stabbed?

Today's off to a good start. Officially have at least one person I haven't disappointed. 😘
"I think that although misgendering someone on purpose is really rude, I just think there needs to be more education on pronouns and gender identity. At least in my definition,""he""/""she"" are not inherently male/female, but just masculine and feminine. I think the people that idenfity as both/neither should use plural pronouns such as ""they"" or just either. It may be a stretch, but other languages sometimes use plural pronouns such as ""Vous"" in French."

"Once we were so hungry, my friend Marlboro (yes, that was the actual name they gave him.. jokers) and I decided to steal a local sheep and cook it.  We snuck off during our late night watch, cut a razor wire fence and went in.  Sheep actually make a lot of noise and absolutely freak out when you try to grab them.  They are pretty strong as well.  The farmer woke up and started shooting at us!  I got caught on the razor wire escaping and cut my leg open pretty bad.  I couldn't say anything about it, and had to march 22 kilometers the next day in absolute agony.  That was probably one of the dumbest ideas I ever had.

Got to jump out of helicopters into water at pretty crazy heights.  Learned a lot about mountain search and rescue including how to climb.  Learned how to ski and shoot at the same time.

If you are thinking about joining the Legion don't.  Normal military have all sorts of regulations about what you can do to soldiers during training.  Literally no one is accountable to anything in the legion.  I've seen guys get the shit kicked out of them by the Lieutenants just to make an example in front of the others. It's not a requirement to speak French when you join but if you don't you are going to have a rough time believe me.  Instead of putting you in a classroom, they prefer to beat it into you.

They also make you sing all the time while marching at like 3/4 speed, it's their thing.  You spend at least half your time doing this."

Hell, alot of my conservative friends wanted to vote for him for the hell of it.
