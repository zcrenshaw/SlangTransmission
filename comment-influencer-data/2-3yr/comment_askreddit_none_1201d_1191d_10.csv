"A friend of mine used to own a bar.  I became friends with him after he had sold it.  We were buds for a few years before I heard the story that made me toss him as a friend.  When he owned the bar, there was a girl who would come in and chat with the customers and workers.  She was really slow, but totally harmless and really nice.  A few years earlier, she was a ""normal"" girl crossing the street when a drunk driver hit her and caused her brain damage which made her slow.  She worked as a bagger next door at the supermarket and would come over and chat on her breaks.  Anyway, she had a giant crush on one of the bar regulars and one day, she comes in, but he isn't there.  However, my buddy is.  For some reason, he decides to fuck with her.  He tells her that this guy she has a crush on wants to meet her later for a date.  He tells her to show up outside the supermarket where she works at a certain time, to be all dressed up and that he'll be there to take her out.  She leaves excitedly.  Sure enough, she shows up at the designated time, being dropped off by her father, all done up, waiting for a guy who wasn't going to be there.  Apparently she started to cry when my buddy, and a load of his customers came streaming out of the bar to laugh at her.  When I heard this story about my friend, and after confirming it with him, I decided there was no way I could be friends with, or respect someone, who could be so utterly cruel.  Fuck that guy.  The girl ended up quitting her job because she was so ashamed."

I had health insurance overseas, but came back to the US and had a routine cleaning done at one. Took forever but it was very cheap. In that particular instance, I had to go to a different dentist to get the filling I was told I needed done. Not sure if they'd have been able to take care of it if I'd had a flexible time schedule. My understanding is that some colleges do.

Toby also writes criminal novels in his spare time and had a consistent obsession with the case since the Strangler was first introduced.

2. Breaking Bad is a prequel to The Walking Dead. At the end of BB, Walter turns his car into a dealership - whose manager is named Glenn. Season 1 of TWD, Glenn is shown driving a car similar to Walter's. Season 2, Darryl pulls out his brother Merle's stash of drugs in an attempt to find something to bring down T-Dog's fever. There we see a bag of blue crystal meth.

"1. I probably wouldn't believe it or not believe it either way. There are lots of crazy stories about Bill Murray. Some are true, but because of all the true stories, there are lots of made-up ones.

3. In the vignette ""Delirium"" in Jim Jarmusch's *Coffee and Cigarettes*, Bill Murray works as a waiter in a diner. Unlike the above story, he isn't seen as a trouble maker. Wu Tang members RZA and GZA are surprised by his presence in the diner, and he refers to them as trouble makers. He is happy to spend time with them, which resembles the open-minded Bill Murray in the anecdote above.

4. He resembles Abel Magwitch, as both are unexpected benefactors who the protagonist knew in advance. Both are also reformed trouble makers in the narratives; Murray had a lot of detention in school, while Magwitch is a reformed criminal. "

it causes cirrhosis to the liver and possible kidney failure.  since the liver filters the blood this can cause a build up of toxins in your blood and cause hepatic encephalopathy which is pretty much insanity. also your liver is responsible for the blood cascade which is the creation of platelets. platelets help clot. so without them a simple fall can lead you to bleed out . as for the kidney. they also filter your blood but they are also vital in the creation of red blood cells. if your kidneys fail then you become anemic and can't move oxygen through out the body. those are just the main things.

"I am allergic to corn!  Certain types of corn products affect me more than others.  My reactions to them don't endanger my life, so it's alright to experiment a little.

Corn syrup will make my face puffy and I may be slightly tired.  It is the least offensive of all the processed corn.  I will avoid it most of the time out of habit, but it's not a big deal if I eat/drink it.  Person below says that high fructose corn syrup doesn't have any corn in it...I don't know if they're full of crap or if I'm just not paying enough attention to my reactions to notice a difference between regular and high fructose.

Corn starch is the worst and will give me the shits, send me to sleep for 5 hours, and make my face puffy and my brain foggy.  I devote a fair amount of effort to avoiding this one.  I do not take aspirin because corn starch is often used as a binder in pills.  I have certain brands of painkillers that are either corn-free or cause a negligible reaction and I stick with those.  Advil is okay, tylenol is NO.  One time someone gave me a pill to ""help"" my stomach on a backpacking trip and I threw it up 5 minutes later.  Then pooped.  Was lovely.

Let's see...Corn meal is a bad one, so I don't normally eat fried things if I don't know what type of coating it is.  I avoid creamy soups because they are often thickened with a corn product (usually starch).  If I am trying really hard to be 100% corn free I end up avoiding most starches other than rice.  I've never had a problem with contact solution or window cleaners.  I have also drunk from cups made of recycled corn, and while they filled me with rage they did not fill me with shits, which I guess means they're okay."

"r/conservative bans you if you dare disagree. An instant ban is saying ""southern strategy"". What that was was a push by republicans to appeal to racist democrats who felt abandoned by their party by proposing racist policies.        

I think you can also get banned by saying ""happy holidays"", but I'm not too terribly sure about that.

"Oh man, do I have a story for this question.

My wife and I have had rental houses for a number of years.  One of our houses was in located in a very rural area and was rented out to a woman who was a ""truly wonderful tenant.""  She ""checked out"" as a perfect renter in every respect - verified employed, banking info, references, single, mid 40's, no criminal history, etc.  

For the first two years we had absolutely zero issues - and our visits to the property revealed absolutely no problems.  Yard was perfectly kept.  Inside was spotless.  Any minor maintenance issues that came up she resolved on her own and just sent us a receipt for reimbursement.  There was never so much as a single complaint to us or even a minor issue with her as a tenant.  At the end of year two, we signed a lease renewal for another five years thinking we had hit the ""long-term renter lottery jackpot,"" and honestly, and we just left her alone based on the previous two years of good dealings.

Since the house had been completely redone prior to this tenant, and based on our experience with her, we knew there shouldn't be any issues with anything...no exploding water heaters, no need for paint, no worn carpet, no leaking roof, nothing at all to worry us...so we left her alone and just collected our rent checks.

Well, about 18 months into the second lease term we got a call from the local police department that we ""needed to get to our property...now.""  The policeman refused to tell us more.  We dropped what we were doing and drove over thinking there might have been an accident or something like that.

Oh, how wrong we were...

When we arrived there were about twenty police cars, about five fire trucks, maybe ten animal control vehicles and at least fifty various people wearing haz-mat suits and gas masks going in and out of the house.  There was a make-shift shower thing in the street with a line of scroungy dogs getting hosed off.  Our tenant was sitting in the back of one of the police cars, naked and handcuffed, and screaming though a gap in the window.

Obviously, and of course, we asked what was going on and we were eventually informed by the officer that called us that our home was being used as both a dog breeding facility and a meth lab.

Yup, in just 18 months our house had been gutted and was being used as both a dog breeding facility and a meth lab.  Our ""perfect tenant"" had developed a whole new set of meth cooking/dog breeding friends and they had stripped the entire interior of the house in which to operate their enterprise.  

It seems our ""perfect tenant"" had developed a crack and meth habit that she didn't have the ability to pay for...and after being fired from her job for theft and drug abuse had made a deal with the local meth ring to ""sublet"" our property to them to cover her ass...which of course they also pimped out 

Between the absolute filth and destruction from the dogs and the toxic waste cleanup bills from the meth operation, the total damages to the house were over $90,000 resulting in our insurance company declaring the home a total loss and it was eventually bulldozed.

Arrests were made.  Prosecutions occurred.  People went to jail...including our former ""perfect tenant"", who, I will add and close this account with, was found dead last year of an OD just four months after her release from prison. "

"My favorite manifestation of this is when people are into mysticism/spirituality and get enough of a grasp of a pop science explanation of a legitimate concept and weave their mysticism crap into it. I have a facebook friend who said this:

&gt; synchronicities (meaningful coincidences) are either projections of thoughts that you are having at the moment or are signals and codes for you to decipher from your higher (unconscious) self since your (whole) consciousness is devoid of a concept of time and space and ultimately pervades both of these things it can alter fragments of the NOW reality by impregnating the past with minor tweaks that will play a role in the present to send a message or act as a mirror for you. this is actually how magic works as well... which is very real since its simply just consciousness having an effect at the quantum level creating change through this dorrway through time and space and the collective consciousness known as Daath or the abyss in Quabalah

What I take from this is she's trying to insert her ancient superstitions into the weird quirks of quantum theory, which I don't even pretend to understand."

"I just had my first fresh sweet potato as an adult tonight. As a kid, I hated them, but that's likely because the ones I had came from a can or were overly sweetened to the point that it was nauseating. But I'm spending this summer apart from my husband (who hates sweet potatoes), and that gives me the chance to expand my palate while only potentially offending myself and not the guy I also try to feed well (we're apart while I pursue an internship and he teaches summer courses at the local university). It was pretty amazing - baked it off, added 4 oz of taco-seasoned ground turkey and a tiny bit of freshly shredded cheese (plus some seasoning), and I'm stuffed now. They're delicious when they're not loaded down with some form of sweetener and/or butter. Next time, I'll try it with some mushrooms or TVP mixed in to cut down on the meat I use."

"Pretty much everything...

It's popular to think the world is going to Hell in a hand basket, but largely we continue to improve our living conditions with every generation. Crime rates decline; life expectancy tends to go up; poverty tends to go down; quality of life improves.

True, on a global level there are still countless crisis to deal with. The environment is in serious trouble. Poverty is an absolute pandemic in the Middle East, Africa, large parts of South America, etc. There are serious issues with crime and the drug trade. Human trafficking is a real issue. 

But every generation, we become better and better at acknowledging these problems and working toward a solution. We're good at finding a problem and looking forward for a solution. 

Things aren't that bad...and where they are that bad, the human race will actively work toward finding a solution to the problem."

"This isn't someone I currently work with, but rather, someone who I worked with up until about a month ago. I also wouldn't say that I hate her, but she is probably the most annoying person I've ever met.


I work in a daycare, and this woman was hired to work in the infant room. She has no children of her own, had never worked with children before, and didn't really seem to like children, which was evident by the fact that she acted like she had the most stressful job in the world. Mind you, she worked with babies, so her job mostly consisted of sitting around while the babies slept. She complained to me incessantly, often about how the babies kept getting her sick so she couldn't go to CrossFit, and also about how one of the other women in the infant room, (who is the mother of a one-year-old), kept correcting her work. That particular woman, (who is a total sweetheart), was the reason the annoying lady eventually quit.


Some more annoying things about her:

-Would cry if a baby spit up on her

-Would cry for no real reason

-Would try to set the baby she was holding on top of the baby I was holding if she felt overwhelmed 

-Yelled at the babies

-Boasted about her ""healthy"" lifestyle which was non-GMO and gluten free, even though I saw her eat Goldfish crackers pretty much every day

-Told me she would rather Donald Trump be president than Hilary Clinton because Hilary doesn't support GMO labeling (thankfully she is from Australia and not a US citizen)

-Told me she has herpes

-Would talk about her Tinder hookups 

-Told the other women at the daycare when she peed her pants at work 

-Would brag about how good-looking she is even though her teeth look like candy corn

-Broke up with her ""on-again, off-again"" boyfriend of three months and then took him back because he met her requirements of getting rid of his cat, cleaning his carpet, and going to CrossFit with her "

"Everyone involved in a fight gets equal punishment of two days suspension, wether you were the attacker or just defending yourself or even if you tried to break it up. If you laid hands on someone you were just as much in the wrong. Whereas at other schools a kid who gets attacked but tries to get the attacker off of them is not punished, now taking any action to try to get rid of a bully would get you punished. But also, it doesn't matter how much the fight escalates because it's always two days suspension unless you're a repeat offender. This means that if you were attacked and you pushed them away, you'd be in just as much trouble as if you socked them in the jaw.

"I worked at a hotel in my town as a night audit when I was in school and the owner/manager of the building was a complete asshole. He was from India and very racist and mean in general. He never saw his workers as people, just cogs in his hotel machine that can easily be replaced. It didn't help that he was incredibly cheap and never paid one penny over minimum wage for jobs that usually make more.

We had this security guard who was a chill dude and good at this job, but the boss thought security wasn't needed for a hotel despite every other hotel in our city having one or two guards. Anyway one day the boss laid him off because again, he's cheap and any way to save money he will do it. The story goes that they simply took him off the schedule and didn't tell him he was fired. They didn't say anything to him they just took him off the schedule. So the guard came in on my co-workers shift and asked why he hasn't been called in or anything, and they let him know he's been let go. 

The guard loses his shit in the lobby and the way my co-worker tells it, he was beyond red and angry. He was yelling at our owner stuff like, ""You didn't even have the balls to tell me"" and ""This place is a dump because of you"" so the owner loses it and starts trying to push him out the door. I guess what happened next was the guard pushed the owner back and screamed ""Or what? Are you going to have security escourt me out?"" 

It was awkward after that. I quit two weeks later because the place was a dump and it wasn't worth the low pay and bad management. "

"* Only charge things on a credit card if you know you'll be able to pay it back ASAP. Credit cards *can* be a good thing to have, but they have got to be used responsibly.

* Have an emergency savings fund. Put a percentage of every paycheck into it. (Depending on your income and expenses, this could be as little as 1% or as much as 90%.) That way, if something happens (you lose your job, you miss a week's pay due to illness, you have to go to the emergency room, your tire blows out, whatever it is), you have some financial cushioning. 

* The time to buy a plunger is *before* you need a plunger. 

* Learn to cook a few basic meals. Maybe not anything fancy. Maybe not anything that would impress the judges on *Chopped*. But a few basic meals, so you're not spending all your money on crappy TV dinners, takeout, or dining out.

* Just because you *can* eat pizza for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day doesn't mean you *should*. Just because you *can* stay up until 3 AM binge-watching your favorite TV show or stay out all night partying doesn't mean you *should*.

* If you plan to be sexually active (whether that's now, or years down the line) learn *the facts* about anatomy, how to use the various methods of birth control correctly and where to get them, STIs and how to prevent them, consent and what that actually means, how to say no if you don't want to do it, and all that fun stuff if you haven't already.

* Good manners. They're not a sign of weakness, they're important. 

* How to do basic household chores and laundry. Your mom isn't going to come to your apartment to do those things for you, and you might not have the money to hire a cleaning service. 

* How to properly care for any pets you wish to get. Make sure your pet fits your lifestyle and living situation.

* If you're going to have roommates (and you probably will in this economy), you need to know what they're really like. Meet any prospective roommates in person *before* you put your name on the lease.

* Learn to do a few basic home repairs. 

* How to grocery shop on a budget.

* Where to turn to for help if things begin to fall apart, so that they don't fall *too* far apart and you can get back on your feet ASAP. 

* How to resolve conflict. If you aren't getting along with your roommate(s), your landlord doesn't give a shit. 

* Always have a Plan B, in case Plan A doesn't work out.

* How to handle rejections and setbacks *gracefully*.

"I acted as a landlord at one point. Shared a house with my buddy in University. His parents bought him the house and the one next door as rental properties. Idea was he could live rent free, he'd recoup whatever money went on in the rentals to help pay his way, but he had to be the landlord for all those he rented to. It was a pretty sweet deal.

Except the girls next door were clueless, and he was basically never home, and basically, I became the landlord.

They would call constantly, at all hours of the night, about the craziest things.

The worst thing was when one of the girls clogged a toilet, it overflowed, except she didn't do anything about it at all at first. Then when she did I have no idea what she was trying to do. Finally she comes over and knocks on the door asking if I could come take a look.

There was at least an inch of water pooled on the floor, and of course it leaked through the tile and into the basement/ceiling. At first I didn't realize that I just saw a toilet actively overflowing. I'm not even sure how that was happening. I turn the little knob, you know, the water flow and stop that first. Then open the back, and she's somehow rigged it so the bulb won't go up and indicate the water is full, so it just keeps filling. Then finally I plung it and a diaper comes out. She could not explain how or why she flushed a diaper. She didn't have kids, none of them did. It didn't make any sense.

Then of course I go down to the basement, and the ceiling panels are sagging, I touching one and the entire panels disintegrate and rain down nasty water that seeped through the floor.

Basically, I retired. My buddy decided land lording wasn't for ""him"" anymore."

"Note: while the horcrux is incredibly similar, there is one key difference between it and a phylactery. Horcruxes only use a fragment of a soul, broken off from the whole via murder in cold blood, whereas a phylactery contains the entire soul of a lich. The body of a lich can and will regenerate of its own accord even if completely destroyed, as long as the phylactery is intact. A horcrux user, such as voldemort required outside assistance to regain a new body, but was also able to continue to exist without the Horcruxes being intact, due to still possessing a portion of the soul (provided there is, in fact a physical body currently present. Whether voldemortas a disembodied spirit could have remained if all Horcruxes were destroyed is unknown, but it's unlikely he would have survived). The lich can not, and will die instantly upon destruction of its phylactery. The more you know! "

"I recently quit my job for a landscaping company in my home town that handles outdoor water features. I was hired as part of a team that would go out and install self sustaining ponds/streams. The first four weeks I worked there I didn't see a single job, I instead worked in their greenhouse and in the fish department, which I had no clue about. I know nothing about tropical plants, or 800$ exotic koi from Japan. I finally asked if I would ever be put on a job, and they told me to install four fountains across the grounds by the office. Each fountain was about 150-200 lbs, and I had to move them myself on a dolly. These things are so fragile if you look at them wrong they'll crack. On top of these each fountain had to be surrounded with pebbles (40-50 lbs each) and installed with a specific pump and base. I was told to do this by myself, and given a list of things I'd need from the head gardener. I did it all exactly according to the list, and when the boss came over she flipped out. She said the pebbles I chose did not contrast the fountains at all and looked hideous, and they would cause algae around the pump. I apologized, explained I was given a list and did the job, and went about fixing it.  Ten minutes in, the bosses husband comes over to talk to me. He lays into me for about 15 minutes about how it's not about arguing, it's about doing it right the first time. I tried to reason that once again, not the job I applied for, and I was only following directions, apologizing, then continuing to fix the scene while he stood over me. He told me this job wasn't for everyone and I was a talented young man, but if they had to fire me done feel bad about it. All this while I'm literally fixing the one mistake I had made on the job. After being berated by both of them all morning, and being told subtly that I was ""just not smart enough for the job"", I walked up to them before lunch and said ""I thought about what you said and yeah, this job isn't for me, thanks though"". Clocked out and went down the street and got another job, came back and returned my outfit. They didn't think I was serious about quitting, and it was Mother's Day weekend (busiest weekend of the year). From what I've heard from a co-worker, the rest of the day was a panic since I was the only one helping with fountains that day, and both bosses are elderly and can't lift heavy things. I regret nothing. Don't bitch at the only young person you have working hard. The other best part is now they refuse to pay me. It's been three weeks. When I went back in last week asking for my final pay my ""papers had gotten lost"" and they were working on it supposedly. I've stopped being upset about it.

The Painting Goblin

""Every time I play the Sims, I start my family with a painting goblin. I make him/her morbidly obese with green skin. I make sure he/she has the following traits: likes to be alone, likes art, hates the outdoors. 

The first thing I do once I have enough money is build a small green room in the basement, send him down there, and then remove the stairs. I set up a tiny little area with only an easel, a toilet, a fridge, a bed, a shower and a trash bin. All he does all day is paint. He paints and paints and paints and paints. Eventually his paintings become very good and worth a lot of money. Every few minutes I go downstairs and sell whatever painting he has finished, and then I return to playing the game. 

My family always ends up feeling blessed because of their fortune, and they never find out about the horrible secret living beneath their home."" "

"Yes, that ""sleeping when the baby sleeps"" secret works great, as long as you're able to make do with sleeping for 45 minutes, waking up, feeding a baby for 30 minutes to an hour, and then sleeping for another 45 minutes, for weeks on end.  Sometimes you may fall asleep while feeding the baby.  This is okay, as long as you make sure to not fall asleep deeply enough that you drop the baby, roll over on the baby, or accidentally leave the baby face-down on the bed/couch/chair as you fall asleep.

And this ""sleeping when the baby sleeps"" works great, as long as you don't need to factor in time for eating, drinking water (omg so much water), showering, changing your clothes, using the bathroom, taking phone calls and returning texts, changing diapers, combing your hair, and cleaning bodily fluids (yours and the baby's) off yourself and most fabrics you've been in contact with.

""Sleeping when the baby sleeps"" is great as long as you can ignore every doubt and fear that creeps into your crazily hormonal brain -- *am i doing this right?  i'm not doing this right.  everyone keeps telling me what i need to be doing and i'm doing everything i can and it all feels wrong.  is my job going okay without me?  will i still have a job when i come back?  i feel so ugly and out of control, does my husband still love me?  how can anyone love me right now?  how can i love this baby if i feel so awful?  how can i even think like that, what is WRONG with me?!?  will i ever feel human again?!?* 

Then you look down at the peacefully sleeping beautiful perfect baby nestled against your sore, ugly, leaking breasts, the tiny perfect toes resting against your flabby, aching, alien-feeling body, and you shift your weight to try to relieve some of the pain between your legs, and you take a deep breath and instead of crying in frustration and fear and doubt and exhaustion, you try to sleep when the baby sleeps.


Cherish these moments, they're the most important moments of your life and your reaction to them defines you as a woman and your ability to handle them measures your worth as a human being.  You've been told this in so many indirect ways through your entire life, and here is is now, your measurement.  It's up to you.  But sleep when the baby sleeps.

When you're not sleeping, smile.  Don't cry, no matter what you're feeling.  Receive all guests graciously.  Everyone will give you advice and tell you to do things slightly differently than you're doing them. Don't argue.  Don't feel judged.  Listen to the people who tell you how wonderful you must be feeling.  Attempt to glow with the inner beauty that motherhood grants you.  Don't get upset. Attempt to act like the functional human adult you once were.  Feel fear that you can't handle this, then feel shame and guilt over that fear.  Smile, and act normal.  Women have been doing this since the dawn of time, surely you can do it too.  What's wrong with you, that you can't handle this?  
  

And yes, sleep when the baby sleeps.  That's truly the secret. "

"The worst tennant I have ever had was a guy who worked out of town 3 months at a time and his wife and 2 kids were home 24/7. She didn't drive and the house is in a very rural area.

My wife was super nice to the mother at first, volunteering to help her with rides once in awhile. She would end up calling my wife every 4 days for help with errands or taking the kids somewhere. After a year, we helped her get her license and let her drive my daughter's older car we kept after I gave my daughter my SUV since she had a kid.

Slowly the house deteriorated inside. We were not super concerned with it since we planned on a full remodel anyways after a few years of renting. Both of their kids were taken away, and after that, the wife left the husband.

He moved out 6 months later realizing he would never be there anyways. The inside of the house looked like a crack house. Diapers everywhere. Trash bags stacked 5 deep outside. At least one hole in every wall. The oven door was kicked in, and the microwave was taken apart.

All in all, it cost me $15k over 2.5 years to have that tennant in the house, and this is after I collected $1000/mo rent.

Current renters now are looking to buy the house and treat it as if it is theirs."

"I used to work in medical billing. This one lady called to make an appointment and she had no proof of her insurance. She insisted she had insurance and was unwilling to pay anything at her appointment. We said if she had her insurance agent call our office with her policy info and confirm that she was insured, we would accept that. So she hangs up, then within minutes she calls us back from the same number (her cell number) and pretends to be an insurance representative. My cowoker got that one and said ""Excuse me, ma'am, are you calling from the patient's cell phone?"" The lady hung up that phone very quickly and we never heard from her again."

"Not a cop, EMT.  Had a call for pedestrian hit by car on rural road.  We haul ass over there and find a twelve year old female in the road with her dad standing over her.  She was riding her bicycle in her driveway with her whole family out in the lawn, road into the road and was immediately hit by an older man driving a large old Cadillac.  The car was driving at 55-60 mph and because of the bicycle this girl hits the windshield, but her head hits the passenger side column.  The girl doesn't die on impact and is instead bleeding out through the large piece of her skull that has been half caved in.  The girl can't talk but she's blinking and making sounds.  Her dad, who had been drinking for the better part of the day - sees the whole thing. He immediately runs out into the road and starts doing the only thing he's ever seen from tv - CPR.  Thanks to his woefully drunk version of CPR, he not only crushes her ribs and lungs, but effectively helps her bleed out faster. To make things worse, I have a brand new paramedic with me, who has never seen anything like this.  Almost as soon as we arrive this girl has no pulse and blood is everywhere.  A volunteer firefighter showed up on scene and is trying to pull the dad off the girl.  Dad and the firefighter get in a full on fight.  We get there, assess her and try to control the bleeding but she's gone.  No pulse, massive trauma, no lung sounds, head caved in, laying in a pool of blood bigger than she is.  Her whole body is just broken. Another EMS unit shows up and it takes me and the other crew to pull my partner away from the girl, who is grey.  As soon as we pull him away, the father begins screaming about losing his little girl and runs into his house, the older man in the caddy - realizing she's dead - begins yelling ""oh my god I've killed a little girl.""  Then things get worse.  The old man in the caddy (who hit her) falls down on the pavement and has a massive heart attack.  He dies an hour later.  Meanwhile dad is inside the house drinking some kind of whiskey as fast as he can before coming back out bottle in hand, completely out of his mind, and attacking things in his yard.  The girl isn't an only child, she's the second youngest of 6, and all of them were outside watching this go down.  Other units arrive on scene, we end up transporting dad, the driver of the caddy, and the volunteer firefighter (injuries sustained from holding back dad).

I go out of my way to avoid that stretch of road.  My partner quit a week later.  "

"I was in my 40s for that decade.  The only thing I remember is that I retired from the US Navy, my first wife left me and my daughter launched herself into adulthood.

Mostly what makes any given decade interesting to a person is the ""milestones"" they collected.  If you set nostalgia aside, then most decades are basically the same.  

The US is fighting someone somewhere (sometimes ourselves at home), we are whining about the national debt, the cost of living, the do-nothing Congress, and many other things.

And if our lives are hard right now, we long to have the good old days back.  Except they really weren't any better than they are now.  Anything in the past is just a memory or a memory of a memory.  We take a few facts and dress them up in pretty or ugly clothes in our mind's eye.  Then we cling to the superstition that who we are today is sum of our experiences.

I think around £200 or something.

Anyway, because he knows this is going to happen, he figures, fuck it, I'll go to every payday loan place available to me in the next week. He got something like £2500 out of repeating the process all on the same day across two cities.

When he sits down in the meeting to finalise the bankruptcy the guys chairing it bring up all of the loans and asks him why he did this if he was to declare himself bankrupt. My friend said ""because they're cunts and I read up on what you're allowed to take and for me to declare"", apparently the guy just verbally agreed their cuntery and processed the bankruptcy anyway. The fuckers got mass-fucked."

"Today I feel anyone who gets around living what was considered middle class in the 20th century is not middle class, but doing really well so long as they're not in huge debt doing so. So middle class looks more like rich than it does poor. 

When it is said money doesn't buy happiness, I only agree when dealing with comparisons between people who are all over 70k a year income. 

The slope of lifestyle improvement gains once you pass 70k a year for an individual plateaus out, while the slope of lifestyle improvement between, say, 25k and 70k is steep and massive. 

To all you young people here, (Im 32), My mom who is 60 years old, worked as a cashier at Kmart in the late 1970s. That job at Kmart being her only income and asset, she was able to afford her own apartment, a brand new car, and lots of money to spare. Try doing that on today's menial job wages.

"Ugh. There's a big event here every 4th of July. Rides, live music air shows, etc. In the early 90's, my brother's best friend was working for the main beer vendor in town. Naturally they had booths all over this event. When they shut down for the day, the guys running the bungee jump stopped by my brother's friend's booth, and had a beer. The beer turned into many as this booth became an after-hours party for the staff at the event. It went on until sunup. The bungee jump guys took a few beers to go, and went back to their station to crash for a few hours until the fair started. At 10 am they had their first customer of the day. They shook off their hangovers, hooked him up, and sent him off the top of the crane.

What they'd failed to do was hook the other end of the bungee line *to* the crane. The poor guy fell all the way down and...landed in the airbag they'd set up for emergencies. Sprained his back and pissed himself, but he was ok. When the cops showed up with the ambulance crew, there were a lot of questions about all the empties laying around the bungee jump. As far as I know, it never came back to bite anybody, but they shut down the beer booths promptly at closing time after that, and had security checking them afterwards. 

Edit: The bungee jump ride was also shut down after that. I haven't seen one there since. 

Edit 2: Apparently he was injured more seriously than I remember, and there was a [multi-million-dollar lawsuit](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/mo-court-of-appeals/1092447.html). No mention of alcohol consumption affecting the ride worker's judgment. "

My boss did nothing other than attend the occasional meeting and sign my time sheets.

After the system (it was a national online system BTW), was live for about 6 months, my boss received this glowing letter of commendation from the clients.

Anyhow, my boss photo-copied it and wrote ""FYI pembroke529"" at the top and presented it to me. I pointed out to him that there was no mention of me in the letter. He points to the FYI at the top. I look him in the eyes and ball up the letter and toss it in the garbage.

"I grew up poor and am still poor, and so did my SO. A few weeks ago our car broke down right as we got somewhere to go out with friends. It was painfully obvious who in the group grew up with money. The kids with money were really nonchalant about it. They were like, ""we'', are you still coming out drinking tonight?"" The people who grew up poor jumped in to help: ""Did you try x, y, z?"" ""Hey, I have AAA now so I can help with a tow!"" ""I'll drive you home!"" ""Do you guys have food at the house or do you need to stop at the store?""

They separated the boys and the girls into different rooms to make sure no one was uncomfortable, I don't know what the girls saw but I don't imagine it was much different. Basically showed us a few diagrams of all the parts on the nether regions for both boys and girls. Still remember vas deferens from that time just because I was certain they had made up that word on the spot. Told us how hormones control most things with women and how their period can fluctuate based on stress and surrounding. Showed us how babies form from X and Y chromosomes. What happens to womens bodies when they're pregnant (bigger breasts, more hormones, etc). Made sure to show us all in great graphic detail what horrible wonders await us if we don't use condoms and try to go for STD bingo. They also did the condom on the banana thing.  "

"In another post I mentioned that I used to do alarms.  My friends know this, so a couple of years ago a friend asked for some help.

She was going through a messy divorce with lots of cash on the table.  He had moved out and it was clear she was getting the house.  I went over to help her with her keypad, how to change the codes.  Next day she got a call from him asking why I was there.  He knew my skills as well.  Neither of us had mentioned to him that I was going there, which I immediately took to mean that he was monitoring cameras.

She had no knowledge of any cameras, so I told her where in the utility room to look for the networking feed and pull it.  Then I came over and looked things over immediately.

Cameras everywhere, and he had the alarm panel set up for remote admin, with a cellular backup, meaning that he could add keypad codes, disarm, set remote alerts etc from his phone.  I'm sure he got notifications that day, but he was in meetings he could not interrupt, so I took his system down and documented everything for her attorneys.  Technically he still co-owned the house, so without a court order it was still legal for him to monitor. 

I did hear from him, and my response to his threats was to forward them to his HR department because he used company email to send them.  

We found DVRs, cameras, mics, wireless feeds, internet proxies and all other manner of surveillance in that house and rooted it so that she now controls it all."
"Eh, I'll take a guess. I think for people with a pretty sheltered/boring/challenge-less life (for example, grow up in the suburbs, get married young to someone with a good job, never leave your minivan/church/kids/cul-de-sac bubble) when that person sits down to think of something ""meaningful"" to them, they might not really come up with much. In an effort to sound ""profound"" to their equally boring friends and neighbors, while at the same time being inoffensive and blending in, these people just trend back to these generic and vapid nothings.

"So this sailor comes into port and it's been a while.  He's got some change in his pocket, and he's ready to spend it.  He goes to this bar he knows, and ends up spending everything.  He's totally drunk, but he still wants to get his dick wet, if you know what I mean.

He stumbles down the street to this brothel where he knows the madam, and says he doesn't have any money, but he's only in port for a night, and can she help him out.   She says that has just the woman for him, and tells him to go up the stairs, to the end of the hall and make a left and she has someone who can help him out.

He goes, and he finds this older woman laying on a bed waiting for him.  Now he's drunk, so he doesn't really care at this point, and decides she'll do as well as some of the younger women.  They start going at it, but it's not really working.  She's not getting wet enough, and it's like sandpaper on his dick and he keeps going soft.  He's about to give up, but she stops him from leaving and says, ""Hold on, I know what to do!  I'll be right back!""

She goes behind this screen and he hears some grunting and moving around, and he wonders what she's doing.  Finally, she comes back and lays down and he plows into her, and it is the warmest, wettest place he has EVER been.  I mean, this is AMAZING.  He has the best sex of his life, and after he gets off he lays next to her, catching his breath.

He asks her, ""I have to know, what did you do when you were behind the screen to make it that much better? What did you use?""

She pats him on the shoulder and says, ""Oh honey, I just picked the scabs and let the pus flow."" "

"Its actually a much more complicated (maybe impossible) issue to fix while respecting free speech rights. One might say giving money isn't speech, and thus shouldn't be protected, but if your paying to allow someone you support to be able to speak through advertising, it is actually one of the most accessible ways to speak and actually be heard. As a normal person, you likely lack the financial resources to buy substantial advertising, or do mass mailings to share your speech, so you need to pool your money with other people to allow it. Fundamentally, that is what a PAC is.

But lets say we abolish PACs... the very rich can still spend unlimited amounts on politics, they just need to do it directly now. While you can argue funding a PAC isn't an exercise of your right to freedom of speech, there is no argument that directly paying to erect a billboard carrying your message, or buying advertising to share it is protected speech. Hell, lets take it to the next level and ban even those actions. Now you just need to be rich enough to buy a Newspaper or Radio/TV station, and change its editorial policy to reflect what you want... (Historically, huge numbers of Newspapers were started for this precise reason)"

"This girl that I've been friends with for a good few years has a tendency to throw irrational temper tantrums when she's drunk.

Even if it's in public.

We actually stopped hanging out for a while after one of these but then we made friends again and we were hanging out a lot for a good while. I had a crush on her too and we were both single and I was kinda also trying to go for it, but not actively pursuing - kinda just ""if it happens it happens."" That's important to establish that we were not a thing, she'd never said she had any kind of feelings for me, etc. She had also just recently broken up with her abusive boyfriend.

So one night we went out drinking together and she's trashed. We're having a pleasant time when some girl randomly drunk-texts me. This OTHER girl is also just a friend, and she has a tendency to over-share when she's drunk, so of course, she texted me something about a sexual experience she'd just had with some guy. It was a little TMI but kinda funny so I laughed and shrugged it off.

So crazy girl that I'm hanging out with goes ""ohhh what was that all about?"" And I was like ""Nothing, my friend was just being gross"" and for some reason, I guess thinking she was in for a funny text, wants to see it. 

She then proceeds to flip her entire shit over some girl texting me about her sexual encounters, as if I'm at all in control of what Drunk Chelsea texts me. She throws a huge tantrum at the bar and I'm like ""K, I think we should leave.""

So we leave and she's screaming at me the whole way I'm trying to take her home. And I'm mostly keeping my cool and being like ""Hey, remember how we had a long talk about how you get really irrationally angry when you're drunk and you take it out on the closest person? You're doing that now."" We finally get to a red light, still a good ways from her car and she goes ""That's it, let me out.""

We're in the middle of a busy street but there is no way in fuck I'm gonna get out and chase this girl. I warn her ""Okay, but I'm not coming after you and I want you to try to remember when you sober up that you were the one who wanted to get out of the car. I really think you should just let me take you home; we don't have to talk the rest of the way.""

""FUCK YOU."" Gets out of the car.

That was my ""fuck it, I'm out"" moment - there was no way I was gonna go after her; think how awful that would look if a cop drove by. I texted her to please let me know when she made it home safe because we were in a random part of town. She drunkenly texts me a few hours later of course claiming I let her walk home in the rain.

The next day she texts me a novel-length apology saying she's sorry she acted like an idiot and understands if I don't want to be friends anymore but she left some stuff in my car so can I please meet her to get it, she can come to me, etc. So we meet up, I hand her her shit and the entire exchange was ""Thanks for bringing this to me."" ""No problem! Have a good night.""

Haven't spoken to her since. It sucks that she gets crazy when she drinks but people like that are toxic. Sometimes I miss hanging out with her and I feel bad for her because she's got a lot of issues but I can't keep putting myself through irrational tantrums. She's done this with a LOT of people, mostly guys. She'll get drunk in public, find something she doesn't like and then pick a fight over it. I'm far from the first friend she's lost over her behavior.

Nope. Fuck it, I'm done."

Divorced less than two years later. She said that he ""was always doing the same stuff he did before we were married,"" like playing poker with his friends and going out to get drunk. 

Yeah, no shit, what did you expect from him? He would morph into a stock broker and perfect father? If him doing all this stuff was a problem then marrying him may not have been the best idea.

"My mother has a theory that hasn't failed us yet: if the bride and groom shove the cake in each other's faces at the reception they will end up divorced. 

Besides being just a noticeable trend, it has some backup reasoning to it. When the couple smashes cake in the others face, it's a pretty in the moment, almost selfish attention seeking act. In my opinion it comes off very superficial. And doesnt allow for the appreciation of the act.  While the couples that enjoy the moment for the beautiful thing that it is and don't be silly and smash cake in their SO's face have a deeper appreciation for their partner and the experience. 

So far observed our theory in 7 different weddings. 4/7 were cake smashers. 3 of those have already divorced/filed for divorce, and the forth couple is doing pretty bad. All 3 none cake smashing couples are together and seemingly happy and dedicated to each other. 

Edit: Easy there everyone. No need to get your panties all wadded up and no offense to happily married cake smashers. Congrats on happiness! Just a trend and a theory thats been noticed in my family/friend area. "

"THIS. I've moved a lot within the same town since I left home six years ago. Moving is easy when you're 18 and your possessions are a tv, a laptop, maybe a futon, and your clothes. 

Way fucking harder when you're 24 and you have a tv, a laptop, a desk, a bed, a couch, a stereo, power tools, coffee table, kitchen table, appliances, a recliner, a bike, books, dishes, art, lamps, shelves, dressers, dildos, video games, chairs, guitars...

I've accumulated a lot of stuff in six years. Moving becomes a question of how much something costs to move vs how much it costs to replace. And both are pretty expensive. And ultimately, you don't want to just not have a couch or a kitchen table at your new place. 

Of course, I have friends who sold everything they couldn't fit in their car and just left for the coast. But that is definitely not ideal for the majority of people"
"My girlfriends pet rabbit of 13 years died in her arms. He had just had surgery to remove an abscess under his jaw and it left him with quite a large hole that she had to fill with gauze. They didn't give him any pain medication and said he would be fine but he spent the next 5-6 hours constantly moving around and stomping because he was in so much pain. She was about to take him back to the animal hospital when he started screaming and twitching. They went straight to the hospital but it was too late. He apparently had a heart attack, he probably just couldn't take the pain anymore and his heart gave out. She didn't have many friends in high school so he was her best friend and her baby. She still has nightmares about it and will occasionally remember how he died and just start crying. I just wish she hadn't been there for that last day with him, he died in a horrible way and she saw it all happen. She also feels extremely guilty for not taking him to the hospital sooner because she knew he was in a lot of pain. I just know that she sat with him for hours that night petting him and apologizing that he was in so much pain. She's actually been diagnosed with PTSD from that event and even though it was almost 6 months ago now she still will start crying about once a week because she will have thought about him and misses him."

Honestly I don't think average citizens can comprehend half the terrible stuff people in law enforcement see/hear.

"When I was 16, I'd had a crush on a local 19 year old lad named Ben for a while, and told my friends.  One of my friends engineered it so that Ben and I ended up talking alone, and he asked me if I'd like to go out with him tomorrow.  I said yes, and we arranged to meet in town with no firm plans of what we'd do.  

When we met up, we couldn't think of anything to do, so he suggested we go to my house.  Once there, we watched TV for a while and Ben seemed to be getting a bit bored, so he suggested we go to his house.  We went, and shortly after arriving, the people who owned the house got back. (Ben was the lodger.)  They immediately started a huge argument with him, screaming at him about him not being tidy enough and not being a good housemate and that sort of thing.  They screamed at him until he cried.  The told him they wanted him to move out, and that they didn't want him back in the house for the rest of the day.  So we went outside, and Ben sat down on the front step and cried for a while.  Because I barely knew him I felt really awkward and didn't know what to do, so I just sat there.  Eventually he hugged me and said goodbye and that was it, we never really spoke again."

"I dont have a source for this but theres a very famous attack on a Japanese fort(?) where there were maybe 10 men remaining inside the fort and hundreds of men outside but they bluffed their way out by throwing their doors open and beating on drums to make it seem like they were ready to fight with a whole army at their side 


Edit: Okay okay so I found it!(special thanks to /u/Trackslash for reminding where I heard of it) It was the battle between Tokugawa ieyasu and Takeda shingen during the Sengoku Judai(Warring states period), Takeda was advancing for Kyoto to face Oda Nobunaga but first had to face Tokugawa. 

Tokugawa was getting his ass handed to him and had to retreat back to his castle with only 5 men, yes 5. This badass motherfucker ordered his remaining men to light all the torches around his castle, throw the gates open and beat on dreams. This held off Takeda's forces due to hesitation on his part because surely no one without any men would be crazy to do something like that. 

Later that night he ordered his ninja, Hattori ""The god damn legend"" Hanzo to attack Takeda's forces, finally convincing him that Tokugawa must have more forces with him.

I think I was looking for dragon related artwork for some story I was writing. I guess I was 16 or so? And I just entered some very weird part of the internet. Some guy claimed to *be* a dragon in a spiritual sense and has this huge write-up. 

For some reason I read this document completely without a filter. Instead of taking it as fiction or the ravings of an internet lunatic, I read it as true fact. And when I finished the document I sat on the bed an cried because this was the reason for my social awkwardness and anxiety. I'm not human. I have the soul of a dragon. Finally I knew. 

I told my geography teacher. She was very confused. She didn't really know what to do so she called an ambulance. (this is free in my country)

At the hospital I met a nurse who asked me what the problem was. I told her. 

""...*right*. That's not *really* my area of expertise...""

My parents had to pick me up from the hospital. They were super embarrassed and so was I.

Anyway this incident started the ball rolling for me to eventually meet a psychiatrist and get an Asperger's diagnosis. And suddenly it was like the world snapped into focus, and the otherkin made no sense anymore, and that was it really. 

I told one friend. He didn't blab. Thank God. 

Looking back on it I totally wanted it to be true. I believed it because I wanted it to be true. It's been over a decade since then and I still occasionally have that feeling of wanting it to be true. Emotions are stupid.

Last year I looked up the guy that unknowingly ""converted"" me. He STILL thinks he's a dragon and has both a human name and a dragon name which he uses among his friends. So maybe I got lucky. "

"I was home alone with my best friend after moving into my parents house after a year at university. My parents were out of town and left us some beer so we got pretty hammered then when the time to sleep came around at 2am, I couldn't find my blanket because I had just unpacked. We stumbled to an unused closet in the house to see if my mom had put it there before she left, and I found a brand new drivers license in the closet. Still valid, and the address is over 800 miles away. I have a scanner and the ID is 100% legit from the department of motor vehicles. Who the ID belongs to is even creepier. It's a 26 year old woman, nobody in my family is within 5 years of that age, and nobody I know has ever been to the city she's from. I find her on Facebook, no mutual friends. she went to a university that nobody I know went to. There's no way she's ever been at my house so how her new drivers license ended up in an unused closet in my house at 2am is beyond me. "
"As someone who is into vore, let me explain the mindset a bit for the curious. 

First, you have the distinction between hard and soft vore. Hard vore has a lot of overlap with guro and involves the victim being chewed, ripped apart, digested, what have you. Soft vore typically has the person just being swallowed whole and puts little to no emphasis on digestion or the death of the victim. Often times the victim is even regurgitated. The overwhelmingly vast majority of people into vore are into the soft vore side. 

Then you have the distinction between those who want to be the eater vs eaten vs either. Eaters usually has a super dominate streak. The victim you eat is giving you the ultimate form of submission. Eatens usually are getting off to being submissive and/or enjoy bondage and the idea of being constricted. Those who are into either are typically just getting off to the power dynamics. 

For myself, it's the power dynamics and the sense of helplessness. Being at someone's mercy/having someone completely at your mercy. The idea of loving/trusting someone so much that you're willing to give up yourself completely. 

Throw in the pleasure a lot of folks get from eating, and you've got yourself primed for a kink. "

Anyway, one random day in 2005, I was up late one night gaming when all of a sudden I randomly smelled Cocoa Butter lotion. It happened a little after Midnight. And it was STRONG, and lingered. I was so confused because it shouldn't have been around. I even brought my Mom upstairs and she smelled it too. We both shrugged and I thought nothing more of it, and the smell disappeared at around 4 am.

Well, we got a call later that same day from the daughter of the elderly couple. ...The elderly woman had died in her sleep, shortly before midnight. And the thing is? She LOVED Cocoa Butter lotion. She ALWAYS wore it. I remember it was always heavy when I visited her.

So, yeah. My blood fucking run cold when I put 2 and 2 together and realized that, shit, she visited me last night. Once again, a little after midnight the next day, the smell of Cocoa Butter came back once again.

Probably insane, but I spoke to her a little bit and said I was sad to hear she died, thanked her and all that stuff and said my good-byes. Only the smell lingered again. I went to bed at around 3 am and by that time I had started getting fucking scared by the prospects of a god damn ghost in my room. I regret it, but I reacted out of anger and told her to please leave because she was scaring me. The smell disappeared a couple minutes later."

"Not just at the wedding, but my two friends who had been married for a year before they had a wedding/vow renewal, basically fought over every aspect of the wedding. They barely spoke to each other the day of. And then there was also the fact that they were having sex on the side. Granted it was together and they knew what was going on, but it felt like she just agreed to it to try and control him, and so she didn't need to have sex with him."

"Shit it could've been Jack in the Box I still would've been like WTF. I just gave you a weeks worth of groceries with healthy food for your fucking child. 

These people were pathetic. Their parents had them diapers delivered every other week from Amazon paid their phone bills, all sorts of shit. At some point be a fucking adult.

I remember at one point the wife was asking me for tips on how to get out of debt (they had over $70000 worth of debt!)

Hold let me explain this debt for a minute. So this bitch was in college and had student loans right. Well most schools if you withdraw from a class you don't have to pay if you do it by a certain date or you at least get a percentage back. This bitch was so damn lazy instead of withdrawing she just stopped going... She did this like 8 times! She has 70k worth of debt and 0 degrees! She explained she had a Best Buy card bought a bunch of stuff couldn't pay so she just didn't. Had a T Mobile line... Didn't have money so didn't pay, she said it so matter of fact like that's just what you do when you can't pay. Bought a camera on that Best Buy acct and decided she didn't like it so she sold it for like 3/5 of the price and spent the money on crap. together their debt was reaching the 100k mark!

Anyway... She asks me ""MandalorianFist how can we get out of debt (my wife and I have nice things 0 debt and a budget right... Mind you these people are in identical living conditions same apt complex same paying job etc) so I help her make a budget and come up with a plan to get out of debt which included using the tax return they were going to be getting soon to pay off a couple of high interest low balance credit cards... NOPE! Tell me why he's calling me a week and half later because he needed a truck to help move the TV and entertainment center he just bought from Best Buy with his tax return. I told his sorry ass no. "

"Education.

I have a bachelor's in my content field (History), and a master's in education, with over 250+ PD credits and hours, 10 years of experience, and several awards and commendations for doing my job well. 

But I'm regularly told how to do my job by people who have no classroom experience, or related background experience. Instead, I get directives from idiots who built careers in business or management, and then make the mid-life crisis switch to education administration because 'the system is flawed.' 

Well, no shit it's flawed. It's flawed because I have to jump through hoops to satisfy the busywork needs of a bunch of asshats who think test scores are the ultimate indicator of knowledge and growth.

The same critiques can be made of parents, too. I've had truck drivers, nurses, lawyers, fast food employees, and stay at home moms tell me how to do my job, then show annoyance when I tell them I'm pretty qualified to do the work I do, without their unnecessary input.

So the next time you go to your kid's Parent-Teacher night and plan to rip on them for your kid's grades, consider the following:

* Have you yourself completed (at a minimum) six years of continuing education on the topic of education?

* Do you spend your day trying to divide your time equally between 5+ classes and 100+ students?

* Does your work come home with you at the end of each day?

* Do you spend your work breaks and weekends in seminars, workshops, continuing ed courses, ect?

* Do you actually sit down with your kid and look at their work - both the quality and the accuracy? Assume some responsibility for your precious snowflake - believe it or not, their ability to produce and retain reflects on you and your own abilities, as well.

If the answer to any of the above questions is no, just assume your child's teacher knows more about the field and your child's academic potential than you do.

Oh, and don't bitch at us about 504s or IEPs - we don't write them.

And if you're considering a career in educational management or administration, do yourself a favor and get your cert and spend a year or two in the classroom. If you're going to tell me how to do my job, know what you're talking about. Otherwise, you're a dick and no one in the faculty lounge likes you."
Or a package of Arby's sauce.
"This actually happens quite a bit, and is called bike shedding. Essentially, the more subjective something becomes, the more people will tend to care about it.

People will leave more important and complex issues to be solved by experts, but smaller issues that boil down to a matter of opinion mean that everyone is an expert.

For example, which way the toilet paper hangs. People LOVE to argue about that because there really is no ""right"" answer (hang in front, obviously) so anyone who has ever pooped is now an expert in the field.

I think the problem comes from media and how bigger issues are portrayed nowadays. Choosing the president of the United States, while extremely important, comes off as a matter of opinion. Now, everyone who lives in the country knows what's best for it, and becomes an expert. Any topic that is revealed to not be black and white is something that people will argue about like they know what the hell is going on."

"Prior to having the unaltered memory, Dumbledore knew a few things:

1) Voldemort vanished under strange circumstances, leaving no body behind. 

2) he later appeared having occupied Quirrel's body. 

3) Harry brought him the Diary, which had been destroyed with Basalisk venom, and spoke of a ""living memory,"" which Dumbledore knew to be a horcrux

3b) Horcruxes are by definition a defensive magical item, typically secreted away for maximum protection. The face that the Diary was intended to be thrown into someone's path as an offensive weapon indicated he may have more than one Horcrux, but then how many? This caused Dumbledore to start looking into Voldemort's past. 

4) after a very great deal of investigation into Voldemort's movements prior to the first war, Dumbledore found evidence of Tom Riddle killing people even as a student, and taking tokens of these events (ie, the ring).

4b) Dumbledore also found Voldemort to be determined to find tokens of the founders of Hogwarts. This indicated *what* the Horcruxes may be. 

5) after more investigation Dumbledore found the ring, and managed to destroy it, conclusively proving more than one Horcrux existed. 

All told, this answers every question Dumbledore had about Voldemort, other than one absolutely critical question: HOW MANY ARE THERE? Slughorn's unaltered memory of that night was so critical to the war effort that Dumbledore devoted an entire school year to acquiring it through Harry. It was the last, crucial piece of a very complicated puzzle which helped bring Voldemort down. "

"We used to go to a friend of a friend's cottage up in Parry Sound, Ontario.

For some reason cottages are a huge part of Canadian culture but not much elsewhere, so I'll try to explain what it's like. The one we went to was built around the 70s or 80s as apparent in both design and decor, which hasn't seem to change much over the years, as cottages shouldn't. The walls were all wood veneer, the carpet was shag, with a vinyl kitchen area, and the entire south wall facing the lake was lined with windows and white curtains that would gently blow the refreshing breeze from the water in the afternoon. 

In the morning you could sit on the dock surrounded by a mist that blanketed the lake, and hear the distant cry of a loon as the sun was rising. In the afternoon everyone would be playing in the water, fishing off the pier, or literally chilling inside watching old vhs tapes and DVDs, playing board games, while the local radio station would play atmospheric classic rock and oldies. And at night you'd try to stay up playing cards around the warmly lit kitchen table, and go watch a scary movie under some blankets in between.

For dinner it would be a BBQ of steak, sausage, and ribs, that would return for lunch the next day. And if that ran out, there were always hot dogs and hamburgers to replace them. There would always be one day to go on a walk around the area, meeting locals, and heading into town to see what trinkets and goodies different mom and pop stores had in stock.

Honestly it's my favourite place to go. Unfortunately the one we went to changed ownership so now we don't know anybody who has one. But it's definitely a life goal of mine to build my own one day."

One was at my friend's house. I was young and thought her brother was really attractive. Little did I know, she had told him this. So, to play with my teenage emotions, he came out of the shower dripping wet with nothing but a towel on and started talking to me. Now it's not a big deal but I remember feeling all kinds of emotions I'd never experienced before. If my skin could turn red, it would have been a tomato.

Second story isn't funny. This happened in my teenage years as well. My family went to the USA to meet their old childhood friends. We stayed in their home for a few days. My dad's friends also had their parents living with them. I was playing in the basement and the grandfather came down when I was alone. He sat me down for a ""talk"". The entire time he was caressing my hand and thighs. I thought it was weird but I didn't think of it as anything. However, looking back now... that was really scary. I should have ran out of there."

"If we were contacted by an advanced alien civilization, if a nuclear bomb was detonated over any major city or any other very large world wide news, everyone trying to get online at once and stream video/news would cause a huge surge in traffic and slow almost all major websites to a grinding halt, essentially breaking the internet.

Each country allocates extra bandwidth at certain times (for example the UK added lots of extra temporary capacity for the Windows 10 release), as well as allocating extra bandwidth in the evenings and on weekends.

Lets say we are contacted by an alien civilization and it is made public and live, the entire world would all swarm Youtube, almost every major news website and Facebook at once (rather than having each country peak in the evening local time, so the load is spread) and unless there was some sort of infrustructure already in place for such an event, it would essentially be like the worlds largest DDOS attack but everywhere.

Many of the smaller ISP's around the world would essentially go dark as they are unable to handle the extreme load on the network and will not have access to resources to provide extra bandwidth. Major ISPs would most likely implement some sort of speed restriction with blocks being put in place to prevent torrenting, steam downloading and all ""none-essential"" traffic during such an event. You would find the most heavily affected websites such as Youtube disable all but essential functionallity, most none-essential services such as Netflix, Steam, etc. would be temporarily taken offline.

It would definately be interesting to see how we handle such an event from a technological standpoint.

"This year? How to handle classified material and what the consequences, both legal and practical, for improperly doing so can be. I am an IT professional and I have held clearance. There is a lot of training involved and there's maybe only about a dozen people on my Facebook feed who have had any. 

Here are the things I'm sick of saying over and over again:

* Yes, Hillary supporters, it is in fact a crime, and a very serious one, to mishandle TS/SAP national security information. This is a go-to-prison type of crime, and ""I made a mistake"" is not a defense. Making a mistake when handling that material is specifically what is illegal. They do not fuck around with that shit.

* No, Bernie supporters, simply mishandling classified material is not treason, espionage, sedition, or whatever other scary-sounding legal rubric you want to color it with. That type of overblown political rhetoric helps absolutely no one, least of all your candidate, and it muddles public understanding of some very weighty and serious matters. Stop it.

* Siphoning off classified material to a non-secure system, i.e. a server located in your basement, is something no Secretary of State has ever done before. This isn't equivalent to simply putting a folder in the wrong filing cabinet, it exposes national security secrets to foreign entities. If you need a non-technical analogy, it's more like James Bond leaving an open briefcase full of MI6 dossiers at the Heathrow Airport baggage claim. It is not a minor clerical error, it's a monumental fuck-up that undermines active operations and could potentially cost people their lives.

I realize that a lot of this is pretty specialized information that most people would have no occasion to learn, but damn is it frustrating to see people go jackrabbiting off about this issue when they clearly have no idea what on Earth they're talking about."

Another Redditor responds: 'mate, you can't support a financial group'.

It was funny because it played on the British perception of the difference between football culture in Britain, where clubs are traditionally rooted in the community and fans will grow up supporting the same local team as their parents and grandparents, and football culture in America, where most of the clubs are very new and are set up as franchises that are able to pack up and relocate to a different city. It made it sound like the New York City fan was quite a shallow fan. The 'mate' at the beginning was a nice touch to accentuate the British-American contrast."

"And as a Christian, I will always challenge the use of Leviticus against homosexuality. The New Testament has things to say on it, as well as general Bible principles outlined on sex+marriage, but using Leviticus is poor theology.

Edit: let me elaborate a bit on how Christians should view the Mosaic (Law of Moses) Law. The Mosaic Law is a specific set of laws given to a specific group of people in a specific time and place. These laws govern how the people were to relate to God (""Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind"") and each other (""Love your neighbour as yourself""). These two laws sum up the whole of the law. They are expanded on in the 10 commandments, and then broken down into detail in the rest of the law. This was a system based on sacrifices and ceremony to allow sinful humans access to God.

Ultimately though, the Law end up exposing human shortcomings, and the need for a saviour. Jesus came to fulfil the Law, by keeping it perfectly and through his death and resurrection, paying for our sin. In purchasing salvation in this way, the Law is no longer required. For example, we do not need sacrifices to come to God, we have direct access through Jesus. Thus Christians are no longer required to keep the Law of Moses, we live under the New Covenant, not the Old.

However, that is not to say that nothing contained in the Law is good. For example, the commandment not to murder. This is a good rule to live by. Rather, in Matthew 5 Jesus talks about the importance of following the principles that underpin the Law, and the Holy Spirit helps us to discern what is right, without the need for detailed laws to guide us. If we want to know what continues to be relevant now, we must look at what the New Testament authors write about. So Jesus himself addresses murder and adultery, for example. Similarly, Paul and the other writers elaborate on how we should treat one another.

Thus, when it comes to using Leviticus as a moral basis, we must be extremely careful to understand it in its place in the Biblical timeline. If we arbitrarily pick and choose bits to suit our own inclinations, we misuse it and put ourselves on very shaky footing. To take the parts about murder or sex, and leave the bits about food, introduces a distinction that the text does not clearly make. Rather, good theology is to view the Old Testament through the lense of the New Testament, and see what the New Testament writers address as still being relevant. Ultimately, we are called to be 'Christlike' - so how do we see Christ behaving, and how should we emulate him?"

Now the joke is how tastefully you can include it. Poor directors will have a main character do it or someone who has the center of attention. Great directors slip it in for minor characters or extras to see if you're paying attention to everything or just the main frame.

She altered her voice so she could conduct a phone interview on me

She pretended she had cancer and shaved her head so I would be sympathetic and not break up with her

She got me a job as a writer for some magazine I never heard of and I even collected paychecks, but the money was from her stepfather's bank account with forged signatures ( I was sending crappy poetry pieces to some random fax machine, which I was told was my ""publisher"")

For everyone else asking about why I didn't have my gun out upon entry, the short answer is I was still a relatively new, poorly -trained officer in an agency that at the time was plagued with a rash of officer-involved shootings.  We were actively discouraged from utilizing lethal force.


The suspect was able to get my partner's gun.  I don't know how.  At the time, we weren't issued security holsters.  I'd purchased my own but my partner carried the issued rig.


I've learned a lot since the incident.  It pushed me to become involved in combatives, specifically Judo, then BJJ and at the time, this new thing called ""Muay Thai"" that was foreign and mysterious.  I put in for every training class I could, got denied due to budget &amp; manpower and finally started paying for my own.  I'm now a senior tactical instructor.

"I can't imagine how terrifying this must have been as a 5 year old. 

When I was 26 and 6 months pregnant, I went to my Dad's house to pick up his mail. My dad was working overseas, but my older (and more irresponsible) brother was still living there. I had noticed his car was gone, so when I entered the house and heard movement in his room upstairs, I thought it was his girlfriend. As I was rummaging through the mail I noticed that the movement upstairs had stopped and I heard the floorboards creaking as if someone was trying not to be noticed. Something told me to hide, so I ran down the hall to my Dad's room and saw that his window was broken and glass was all over his floor. As I was realizing this, I heard the stairs creaking so I ran to my Dad's bathroom. 

From there I had a clear view down the hall to a wall where the landing from the stairs was and I could see unfamiliar legs with long black basketball shorts and the bottom of a large red T-shirt standing there starting to slowly bend as if to quietly peek down the hall into to room to escape back out of the house through the broken window. Thankfully, he took a chance and ran out of the front door. 

Luckily enough, I didn't lock the front door behind me as I usually do. I don't know what I would have done if I would have had to confront him. It makes me sick to try to imagine the fear a child would have in that situation. 

Though I grew up in SW Houston (Alief) which is no stranger to gang activity, especially young teenagers/adults trying to rep street gangs like the Bloods (hence the red shirt), I had never had any negative experiences. However, after that day, I never went back to my Dad's house without my husband or brother there."

"This might be an unpopular opinion, but I disagree.
There are two sexes, and that is an absolute binary (exception: hermaphrodite, but that is such a statistically rare natural occurrence that the point is moot). However, gender is more of a gradient that exists between masculinity and femininity. Ultimately, that gradient still settles at two absolute endpoints, masculine and feminine, but one may still identify somewhere in the middle. 

I guess the tl;dr is that there are probably actually about 3 genders. Mostly masculine, mostly feminine, or equally both. I think getting more nuanced then that with exact percentages of masculine traits vs. feminine traits is just semantics and splitting hairs."

- Pushed and continued the idea of Season Passes that require more $$$ towards a game but also split the fanbase (Titanfall was a big victim of this)
- Owns Bioware; never discounts any Mass Effect DLC. Ever.
- Ran Maxis into the ground by a.) Screwing up SimCity with small maps / online-required gameplay, and b.) Screwing up The Sims 4 by dropping content in the last few games and only put them back after a backlash.
- Shoved out Star Wars:  Battlefront with minimal features and bland gameplay to get that Force Awakens bump. Also included Season Passes yet again to further split the non-existent playerbase.
- Owns almost all sports franchises; doesn't allow other games to be made (even originals are barred from being made for PC).

So I would say while they're not ""horrible"", they've got a LONG way to go for me to think of them as ""very good."" Battlefront was two steps back IMO."

A few weeks later she started dating him after I wouldn't have sex with her. Couldn't get the image out of my head.

Well, fast forward to me about to move out, me and my roommate got drunk together and were playing killing floor. One thing led to another and I was blowing him under the table. Ended up going back into his room and proceed to toss our 400 combined pounds about in a sexy manner. 

Then, it struck me... The next day his new girlfriend came over while he was at work. One thing led to another, and we had sex on his bed. He caught us in the act and proceed to lose his shit on her, not me. It was obvious he was driving her into the dirt with his words, so I spoke up. ""Dude, you have no right to be pissed. You fucked me last night while you were drunk. Get off your high horse."" From there, I walked out to the kitchen, naked, to the sounds of screaming and yelling from both parties in the other room. I cracked a beer, smiled, and sat in the next room as they broke up on the spot.

"When your partner fakes an orgasm because you are unable to pleasure them enough, that's definitely a bummer.  However, I actually find it a lot of fun when they intentionally fake one for me.

For example, if I've already made her cum and she's finished, it's a lot more fun while I'm trying to finish when she still pretends to be super into it.  When she's acting she can even pretend like my rubber duckies are actually a turn-on for her which is a lot better for me too.  If she's not in the mood sometimes she'll agree to fake one for me as well which is certainly better than nothing."

"&gt; They'd treat money like it had an expiry date. Almost like if they left it in the account for too long, it would be taken away.

That's because it does. Some bill will come up. Some expense. Something breaks, something leaks, some repair, some replacement. If you don't spend it on something when you have it, it slowly bleeds away to mundane expenses and you're left back at paycheck-to-paycheck with nothing to show for that windfall.

So when you get your couple thousand dollar tax refund, you buy a new TV or put a downpayment on a car or get a new computer. Because if you don't, it just ends up getting Kraft Mac and Cheese instead of the store brand, meat from the actual meat counter instead of the pre-packaged ""meat"", stuff like that.

Yes, those expenses still pop up, but then you just scale back to pay for them, or you use that credit card you have ""just for emergencies"" that has the 29% interest rate. But at least you look at your new TV or your kids playing their new video game console or sit in your new recliner and you *feel* like you accomplished something with your money. Even if you didn't."
"Russell Brand

What a narcissistic prick."
"Might be late to the party, but I'm going to chime in anyway because nobody taught me shit about my appearance growing up, so it's an important topic for me. I even go out of my way to teach the basics to my kids even though they're only in elementary school. They need to learn the rules before they can fashionably break 'em when they get older. Here are a few that spring to mind:

GOLDEN RULE: WEAR CLOTHES THAT FIT YOU. It takes a little work to learn how clothes are supposed to fit, but you can get away with almost anything if they actually match your body type. I'm tall and thin, so shirts have always been either too wide or too short, but it's been worth the pain of hunting for ones that are just the right length and where the shoulder seam goes right to the edge of my shoulder.

- If your pants have a belt loop, wear a belt. (Unless it's covered by a shirt, in which case it doesn't matter.
- Match your belt to your shoes. Period. Obviously that means you're going to need more than one belt, but that's what closet belt hangers are for. And spend a little extra to get good belts that will last for a long time. 
- Match your socks to your pants (or at least make sure that they're darker than your pants.) Unless you're making a deliberate fashion statement with some wacky socks (and be careful when you do!), they are just functional articles of clothing. Matching them to your pants makes the transition to your shoes clean, whereas matching the socks to your shoes just makes your shoes look like boots. I've even gone out of my way to find some denim-colored crew socks to wear with jeans and clean Chuck Taylors, and it looks awesome. Really showcases the Chucks.
- If you're wearing a patterned shirt, wear a single-color tie. If you're wearing a single-color shirt, wear a patterned tie. There are exceptions if you're smart, but this should be the default. Wearing two different patterns makes you look like a clown. This is also true of shirt + shorts combos, although that really only comes up if you're in sporty clothes. Crazy patterned surf shorts look horrible with a crazy patterned t-shirt.
- Learn a little about color coordination and color relationships. ""Clashing"" colors is not just a trendy fashion thing--certain color combos just look fucking terrible to the human eye. While you're at it, be careful to avoid color combos that we already associate with something specific. Purple + green = Green Goblin or the Joker. Red + green = Christmas. Red + yellow = McDonald's. Etc.
- If you're wearing shorts, wear short sleeves and short socks. Shorts + long sleeves = wtf, is it cold or hot out? Shorts + long socks = you're playing soccer or you have a mental handicap.
- Fit your clothes to the occasion. Wear a suit to a wedding (unless it's a casual wedding in which case a sport-coat and slacks is fine), wear sneakers to the gym, wear a Members Only jacket to an 80s party, wear tap shoes to a tap recital, wear a swimsuit to the pool, and figure out what is appropriate for your workplace and wear that...*or* wear something slightly nicer. (They say you should dress for the job you want, not the job you have.) If in doubt, it's better to overdress than it is to underdress.
- Guys--take some time to groom yourself. Keep your nails trimmed, keep the eyebrows under control, and keep the beard off your neck. Anything girls spend time on themselves, they'll notice in other people.

That's just a few tips off the top of my head. Personal appearance was one of my weakest areas growing up, so I hope some of this has helped. You may think fashion doesn't matter, but it will dramatically affect how people treat you. It's very similar to the difference between being born ugly and being born beautiful. It will actually change your path through life.

EDIT: Okay, I get it—long-sleeves and shorts can look great. Just goes to show you that learning about fashion—even basic fashion—is an ongoing process. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go check out my long-sleeves and shorts."

"Funny I had a somewhat similar conversation with my friend when he came out. He had been a good friend of mine throughout Jr high and high school, we ended up going to college in cities that were somewhat close. Neither of us were particularly good at making friends so we stayed close, I'd go to see him every couple months to play video games all weekend. 

Anyway one time he was offline the entire weekend which was really unusual for either of us. When he gets back online on Monday I sarcastically asked, ""hey man, where were you all weekend? With your *boyfriend*?"" 

""uh. Yeah actually.""

""oh. Shit. Cool. Civ?""

I was apparently the second person he told. Never seriously suspected. Just a bad joke that ended up being right. "
"I also had a coworker pass away. She was a frequent social media poster and then one Saturday night she just stopped. I think halfway through her scheduled shift on the following Monday, someone called the police for a welfare check and found her body in her apartment. "
It was 9:15pm on a Tuesday
"At work- They hired someone for me to report to even though I'd be doing the job for ~6 months or so. I trained the guy to the point where he let me do my own thing which was good but I was seriously underpaid. They promised a promotion along with a hefty raise if I hit certain metrics which I did along with doing my bosses job while he didn't bother showing up (35 sick days in 2015, 21 so far this year). 

I was more patient than I feel most would be. I finally got my ""big promotion"" where they had me continue to report to the guy who never showed up, changed my job title and gave me the huge lump sum of $5,000 which was less than 10% of my salary. Industry average for the position I'm in is ~15-20K more than what they moved me to and I knew that for a fact and showed them those facts. I told my director I wouldn't be able to live with that number, he told me that was the number and I had my ""fuck it, I'm done"" moment.

1 phone call, 2 meetings later I had an offer for substantially above market value and tomorrow is my last day.

Probably the most satisfying part of the whole process was when I told my Director and VP I had the offer in hand and the tried to negotiate with me to stay. "" You guys had an opportunity to negotiate when I first brought this forward, I don't see a reason for me to give you another chance here. Thank you for the experience I've gained while working for you, my last day will be June 3rd.""


EDIT: So the guy who never shows up says to me this morning "" We need to meet on a few things and I need to task you with a couple of things before you go"".... LOLOLOLOL, ya, like that's going to happen. This guy is so fucked it's not even funny. I can hear the fear in his voice, he just doesn't have a clue.

"My sister in law is in that panic mode.. She's mid 30s, and wants kids, but her last relationship of 7 years fucking blew up like a nuclear bomb. Her life is shattered, she has no job now, became an alcoholic, jumped into the first relationship she could (when I thought she should take at least a year if not two, to just get her shit together), blew that relationship up because of her selfishness. A month or so after that one detonated, she's now in a new relationship.

She's a mess, and everyone is tip-toeing around her, saying she's getting better, and things are good. I don't buy it, she's not at her lowest, that's for sure, but she sure as fuck isn't ""better"", well better is a relative term. She needs a lot more help, and desperately needs to be seeing a therapist on a weekly basis. But she only goes to AA meetings.

She's an extrovert, and can't stand being alone... I just keep thinking, that if I was in her situation, I'd be handling it in a complete 180 from her. Oh, and she also wants two cats too, she can't even take care of herself, but she wants cats, kids, a relationship...

He tells me that he loves Monty Python so I quoted the newt line with a British accent (still hadn't seen the movie but I pretty much mimicked my friend) and the guy JUST STARED AT ME like I was insane. I told him it was from one of the movies (praying I was right...remember: 10th grade, awkward) and he goes ""No, it's not"" and I was so embarrassed that I pretty much turned into a tomato. And so, up until this exact moment, I thought that line wasn't actually in any Monty Python movie because that co-worker, the supposed Monty Python lover, told me that. Anyway, in summary, thank you. I should probably just watch this movie. "

4) They didn't know of Pettigrew's significance. *Even* if in those less than three years where Ron was in school and they had the map, and they happened to see Ron quite a few times because he happened to be around his rat at the moments they checked it, they didn't know WHO Pettigrew was.

We started in the 2000's as a web company. We didn't make a ton of money, but in the year that we stopped we were just starting to get the more lucrative jobs that we had been striving to get.

It seemed like a good idea at the time to start up on our own as we were both working for the same company and could see how it was mis-managed. We thought we could do better and to some extent we did!

What really used to annoy me was that he would never just pick up the phone and call someone, it always had to be an email. Most of the time when he'd tell me he'd sent an email (usually to find out something important and time critical) I'd just phone the person and get the answer straight away.

We also ended up using different stationary based on who did the billing. I came up with the initial set of letter heads and invoice templates, but he thought his was better so whenever he billed, he used his, which in my opinion were hideous.

He also seemed to do a lot of typing while using Photoshop... I now know that he was on MSN messenger/ICQ etc for most of the day. The filing cabinets were near his desk so whenever I heard a lot of keyboard action, I'd go over to get something out and every time, the typing stopped and he'd be working on some design or other when I looked at his screen.

I wasn't a saint either, I used to come in late and work till late as that suited how I worked. I was more productive because of it.

By the end of the 2 years I was going crazy due to all the mannerisms and ticks that he had. If he did use the phone, he'd have to almost psyc himself up beforehand. He'd make a clicking noises with his mouth and I learned to recognise this as 'he's about to make a phone call'. There was a different noise when he was about to announce that he was leaving for the day.

The reason for us winding up too was bull$hit too. Rather than say he'd had enough, he came up with the excuse that his mother was moving away (we both were still living at home at this time) and he would have to move with her. 3 months after we stopped, he was still living at home!!

What I'm alluding to is, be prepared to loose a friendship if you go into business with someone. Sometimes it can work out, but not in my situation. Don't do what we did and avoid confrontation. I think that it may have been better if there had been 3 of us. Someone to cast the deciding vote when there was a situation that needed a decision."

Middle School (6th grade) - RJ. He would read books during class, and never pay attention. One day our teacher tried to take a book from him and make him pay attention but he threw his shoes at her. When he came back from suspension he had to sit by himself in the back of the room by our teacher. 

High School -

2 - Jonathan, he would take pictures of girls at school and masturbate in the bathroom.

"Ah, etymology of slang, a beautiful study where no matter the effort, people are almost never right.

The whip cracking etymology is well-attested, and people today certainly refer to themselves as a ""cracker"" with a whip in mind. Even if it's a old usage, it's still arguably not the first form of it. There's [this article](http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/07/01/197644761/word-watch-on-crackers) which details how a historian specializing in crackers thinks a centuries-older word ""craker"" is the forefather of ""cracker"".

The Wiki entry you probably got your answer from cites the [Online Etymology Dictionary's page](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cracker) for cracker, but the whole story about corn cracking and the nib is not found on that page, so I'm not sure if that was editorializing by the Wiki author or if they have another un-cited source.

I decided to try and get over him by getting into the dating scene. I eventually got an SO, but I still really missed the guy from before. I found myself imagining him in my SO's place during sex. I eventually broke up with SO and found my way back to him. When I saw him, it felt like it had been forever since I had seen him. Fuck man, I could barely hold back tears.

"Sunday's were the bane of my existence at this one restaurant I worked at. Some idiot at corporate had this wonderful idea:

For every adult entree, on Sunday, you could order FOUR kid's meals for ONE dollar each! And our adult entrees started at $6.

So, a family of five could have: one adult entree, four kid's entrees, 5 soups/salads, unlimited bread, 4 kid's drinks, and 4 ice cream cups, for a grand total of........$10.

You couldn't get that anywhere else, even at bottom of the line fast food places.

We would regularly have 2 adults and 7-8 kids come in. Any waiter will tell you that table sucks, leaves a mess, and even a GREAT tip on that table was usually 5-6 dollars.

EVERY.....FUCKING.....SUNDAY.....

About a month before I left, they wised up and dropped it to one discounted kid's meal per adult. The amount of anger and backlash we got was INSANE when that started. A few dine and dashes, cussing, hell, one family literally had the mom start sobbing the first time we told them that 2 of their 4 kid's meals were going to be FOUR dollars instead of ONE.


Edit: Yes, I know that for some families, this was probably the only way they could actually 'eat out' and afford it. And some families were nice, and leave 50-100% tips on this stuff. But not the majority.

"From experience at my clinic, we actually do see a very large amount of patients with food allergies (chronic ear infections, salivary staining on feet, legs, and anus, itchy skin). The difference is very few dogs are allergic to *grain* which is what the current fad is trying to peddle. Most food allergies are caused by the protein source. In most cases, switching dogs to a venison/salmon-based or hydrolyzed protein diet does wonders for their issues. Of course we also have patients that don't respond to a diet change (even after trying several different ones) or they do but not at a 100% turn-around. In those cases we can supplement with steroids during heavy allergen seasons or bring out the big guns with Apoquel."

"*Big generalizations here*

Typically high schoolers have an inflated sense of their own competence, which makes them seem very immature.  Many think they are invincible, extremely intelligent, and can basically do anything (or any mixture of the three), without really doing any of the things they believe themselves to be capable of. 

It isn't that they don't have the potential to be regarded as a mature adult, it's just that most don't have the experience or knowledge one would typically find in a mature adult, hence act and seem immature.  Once high school kids go off to college and/or get a job they take on more responsibility and are viewed much more maturely.

"I'm the sister, but our mom and I share the same opinion.

 My bro got his hs gf pregnant and they didn't tell our side of the family until she was 7 months (when she started to show) -- she was tiny and wore the right clothes. When they told us, we were understandably shocked but after a bit of processing, we were supportive. Shortly after, they got engaged. Shortly after that my parents agreed to let them stay in their house and not pay rent ( until bro got a steady job) and help them ready the baby's room, help them get what they needed before the baby, etc. Her parents were not willing to help out. They were supportive if their decision, but they were not going to go out if the way to be helpful.  Basically, my parents were amazing at handling this situation. 

After the baby, SIL got really lazy and didn't want to help around the house that they were living in for pretty cheap rent ( also it was a huge house 2000+ sq ft.). She started telling my bro that my mom was just taking money from them (rent) that she was just spending on herself (not true). She was always tearing my bro down even though he got a strenuous job to help pay their very inexpensive bills so they could have money for the baby. And she eventually nagged him enough that they got a 2bdrm apt in the next town over (800 ish sq ft. for more than twice the amount if rent) and it only got worse for him. :(((

They are now separated and she still constantly asks him for money for herself and not the baby, tries to manipulate him into giving her his stuff (his bed--because her current, abusive bf doesn't have one; his giant TV -- because she wanted it; etc.) and thankfully he's started to say no to her. 

He is still very involved in his daughters life, but trying to cut out his daughters mother is impossible. Unfortunately, he'll have to deal with her for his whole life because he is definitely staying in his daughters life no matter what it takes.

She just became this leaching, toxic person that she never was before she had the baby. She was quiet, but sweet and kind and eager to help and now she just sucks all the happiness out of my bro and I'm glad that he's taking measures to somewhat remove himself from that situation. 

TL:DR wife becomes toxic after having a baby, and after multiple instances of manipulation and toxic behavior it causes MIL and SIL to get understandably upset.

EDIT: A lot of people are bringing up depression. I just wanted to say that I'm not unaware of the fact that it exists and that it might be applicable to this situation at least in part, but I still think that after all the help that my family has offered her she shouldn't be as toxic as she is now. If nothing else, she has only become more and more selfish and entitled to  what my bro has since they have split up.  She didn't exhibit any signs of being depressed in any way (i know there are alot) and she knew that we would be willing to help with whatever she needed. I just wanted to say that in the situation she just seems self interested and entitled--which happens when you're young. 

I think sometimes people like to use mental illnesses (depression, anxiety, narcissism, etc.) as valid excuses for shitty behavior, but it's still shitty behavior. The prolonged amount of time that this went on for also kind of diminishes  the depression factor--of course it's different for everyone. I'm also not giving a blanket statement about mental illnesses, if you are going through something then you're not automatically a shitty person who does shitty things. For this specific instance I think that she was exhibiting more toxic behavior and not exhibiting any behavior of someone who needed help regarding depression."

I was a virgin at the time, and terrified of my religious family finding out I'm gay and kicking me out of the house. His roommate was a close friend of mine, and they both knew how important it was for me to keep on the DL.

"Technically, the atmosphere extends far beyond the ISS because the exosphere ends at about 6000 miles high, but the stratosphere (which I think is a reasonable limit of what we intuitively consider ""the atmosphere,"" since air pressure up there is 0.001% of that at sea level) only reaches about 30 miles up. Compare that to the diameter of Earth, which is about 8000 miles. The ratio of the atmosphere's to the planet's thickness is 30/8000 = 0.00375, or about 0.3%. Scaling that down to a 12-inch globe, the stratosphere would only be about a millimeter thick."

"While my dad and I was walking our dog, a drunk man (obviously he was drunk more often than not) came walking in our direction.
It was in a nature area where dogs would run freely, and our dog was running a little ahead of us.
When the drunk man got close to our dog, he started yelling and barking at it. I have no idea why, as our dog hadn't shown the slightest interest in him.
Our dog proceeded to bark back. It was rather absurd to watch this barking match between our dog and this drunk man.
My dad yelled at him (we was some distance away) to leave our dog alone. The drunk man the took his cane and hit our dog. My dad ran towards the drunk to stop him, while the drunk hit another blow at our dog with his cane.

Now my dad had caught up and forcibly took the mans cane from him and laid in on the grass. The drunk man pushed my dad, after which my dad sucker punched him right in the face.

The drunk man fell to the ground, but quickly sat up and decided to hug my dad's leg. As my dad wasn't able to shake him off, he delivered yet another punch which hit the drunk man on top of his head. The drunk man the fell to the ground once again, and my dad back away a meter or so. My dad then picked up his cane, threw it 10-20 meters into the high grass and put a leas on our dog who had been barking the whole time.

We walked away as the drunk man stumbled around in the gras searching for his cane.

"To everyone acting skeptical that this is actually bad advice, let me offer the perspective of someone who is married to someone who followed this advice for years. 

He wouldn't let the day or evening continue while we were mad at each other, let alone go to sleep. He'd keep both of us up til 2am or later, fighting and fighting and fighting about whatever it was we disagreed about. I'm not very good at arguing, so he would basically overpower me until I would literally get so exhausted that I would tell him that he was right (which I didn't think) and that I could see where he was coming from (which I did not) and agree to whatever his conclusion was. Which is bad enough, but after a few years of this, it would get to the point where, halfway through the argument he would say ""you're so irrational, you ALWAYS admit that you were wrong in the end, so I don't understand why you're dragging this out now!"" 

After years of this, I finally exploded in the middle of an argument. I said, ""Look, I really want to intelligently state my opinion, discuss this rationally, and end the argument right now. But whenever we get like this, all I can think of are awful insults I would never say out loud. It's literally all I can think. I need some time to cool down and think this over, so I'm not going over every single one of your faults in my head on loop."" 

Then an amazing thing happened. He left me alone. We were cordial to each other, but went to sleep that evening without resolving our argument. I think we finally did either the next day or the day after that. It was fine. I could rationally explain where I was coming from and accept his position. We came to our first genuine compromise (born from an intense argument) in years, maybe ever. He has never pressured me to stay in a fight after that. And I've been more willing to have discussions (I used to get really defensive at the drop of a hat) because I'm less terrified that they'll dissolve into an endless argument I have no hope of coming out ahead in. And, we've stopped arguing as much in general. It's been one of the best things to happen to our marriage. 

""Don't go to bed with an unresolved argument"" or even ""Don't go to bed angry"" is truly terrible advice. Don't be a jerk about it, but if you need some time to process stuff, you should be able to take it without feeling like you have to rush to some conclusion. "

Stand on the equator, and take a step forward every billion years


When you've circled the earth once, take a drop of water from the Pacific Ocean, and keep going


When the Pacific Ocean is empty, lay a sheet of paper down, refill the ocean and carry on.


When your stack of paper reaches the sun, take a look at the timer.


The 3 left-most digits won't have changed. 8.063x1067 seconds left to go. You have to repeat the whole process 1000 times to get 1/3 of the way through that time. 5.385x1067 seconds left to go. 

So to kill that time you try something else. 

Shuffle a deck of cards, deal yourself 5 cards every billion years


Each time you get a royal flush, buy a lottery ticket


Each time that ticket wins the jackpot, throw a grain of sand in the grand canyon


When the grand canyon's full, take 1oz of rock off Mount Everest, empty the canyon and carry on.


When Everest has been levelled, check the timer.


There's barely any change. 5.364x1067 seconds left. You'd have to repeat this process 256 times to have run out the timer.

I took it as, simply, George McFly was able to follow his dreams (girl he liked fell in love with him, he gets to write books for a living (which he's really good at)).

Edit: It's seems people are confused why.

"That quintessential truth, Ruth, is that calories are the key anything related to weight, whether it be losing or gaining. Eat less than you need to maintain to lose, eat more to gain. In essence you just need to control your diet.

""But what about exercise?""

Exercise is great, it makes you stronger, more agile, and builds endurance, and will tone and shape your body, but in terms of weight loss, it is simply supplemental, you can achieve the results you want through dieting. That isn't to say it doesn't make dieting easier since you can eat a little more if you exercise it off (but it's usually not going to be like a whole nother meal's worth)

""That's bullshit, I eat less/more and never lose/gain weight""

Then you're metabolism's fucked Jack, or you have some genetic condition. It doesn't mean it doesn't work, it just means that you're gonna have to take it into account and add a bigger deficit/surplus.

"I ignored the constant barrage of Adventure Time love from reddit for ages.

Then, while I was very hungover after a night at my sister's for a birthday party, I was asked to look after my eight year old niece the following day, (read: lie on the couch so an adult is present), while my sister went out to get stuff for lunch.

My sister went upstairs to shower and
 get changed, my niece put on Adventure Time, and, I watched it.

It was the Lemon Grab episode with the whole:

*""Yo. Lemon Grab!""*

*""WHAAAAT?""*

*""You're fired, ya butt!""*

And I did laugh at that.

My sister came down and told my niece to give me the controller so that I could pick something that we both liked, and I just said to let it play. So we watched a few more episodes of it while my sister did shopping and I really liked it.

I went home later, watched it from the beginning, and I loved it.

It's a lot deeper than I expected and has humour placed in brilliantly.

The Door Lord episode is the one that really sold it to me though. And Marceline's stories and songs, like ['I'm Just Your Problem'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLyGQnKMeLU) just make it fantastic.

The whole thing is funny, sad, apocalyptic, hopeful, absurd, reflective, and musically wonderful.

"I was in Toronto when I was 15 with my parents, walking down the street, I wasn't paying attention to the people, I was more or less admiring the tall buildings. I looked ahead of me and walking towards me was this person that I knew 100% had to be me, I don't know how i knew that but I knew it.. he was staring at me with a shocked/amazed look. We walked past each other still staring at each other. He looked just like an older version of me. We didn't say anything, we just walked past each other staring in amazement. Fast forward 10 years, I'm back in Toronto, walking down the same street only in the opposite way as before, then I see my younger self walking towards me. I couldn't say anything or do anything but stare in unbelief. Somehow this was me younger and I vividly remember both occasions."

"One time, right after graduating college for computer programming at the height of the Dot Com boom in 2000, I was at a job fair where someone invited me to an interview.  I was super excited to actually get an interview that I didn't think it was odd that it was at a hotel.  I got there and yeah...it was a pyramid scheme for LookTV.  There was about a dozen confused looking people sitting on uncomfortable folding chairs.  He got into his spiel, and basically you'd be a reseller for a shitty satellite company.  What's worse was the guy was trying to explain how it wasn't a pyramid scheme while showing the ""distribution network"" in the shape of a pyramid.  I'm still kicking myself for not standing up and screaming at the guy in the middle of it.  At the end (yeah, I was stupid enough to stay for the entire thing) I got up to leave, he tried coming up to talk to me to get me to sign some form and I just kept walking.

I'd like to say that was the last pyramid scheme spiel I've listened to, but sadly it wasn't.  The latest was a close friend trying to sell me on It Works!.  I tried to convince her that it was a scam.  She was convinced she could make $10,000 a month.

50 years later the Lions went 0-16.  In the subsequent draft they selected QB Matthew Stafford with the first overall pick in the draft.  Matthew Stafford went to the same High School and grew up on the same street that Bobby Layne did.....

"I had reoccurring nightmares starting at age 7 until my mid 20's after I watched a movie at my friends house that terrified me. I didn't know what the movie was until the subject of nightmares came up at the bar one night and I described the scene.  There was a man standing at the edge of a big cliff inside a cave. There might have been lava, not sure. Another man, who I think is probably very angry, jams his fist directly into chest of the first guy and RIPS OUT HIS HEART. The heart beats in the mans hand. The first man, who now has a bloody cavity instead of a chest, falls over the side of the cliff. I looked up and saw one of the regulars staring at me like I'm an idiot.

"The biggest long-term problem is that of the loss of knowledge, the biggest short-term problem is the loss of maintenance on critical systems.

Books can teach you a lot of things, but there's a reason many real-world skills and professions have training periods: Doctors, Engineers, Lawyers, Plumbers, Electricians, Carpenters.  Those techniques would have to be rediscovered, assuming they ever are. 

Then you have the problem of passcodes, proprietary information, trade secrets, lock-out-codes, etc. 

A 15 year old is not going to find a ""step-by-step guide on how to run a nuclear reactor for dummies"" textbook, or a cheat sheet with door codes to access the control room. 

There's no guarantee, given the secrecy and classified nature of many facilities, that the 15-year-olds of the world will ever learn how to handle these facilities... and no guarantee before catastrophic failures occur.

How long until an operational-but-abandoned refinery explodes due to lack of personnel?  How long until an operational refinery explodes due to lack of maintenance due to ignorance from 15 year olds?  

And no adult, even the last one to die from the disease, will give 15 year olds the launch codes for nuclear bombs.  So how long until someone from this new world goes dicking around a silo? How long until a construction crew demolishes an old silo not knowing what's there?  

Then there's the problem of actually doing the jobs.  15 year olds aren't going to volunteer to be trashmen and sludge pushers... it's hard enough for parents to get their 15 year olds to do basic chores in the current world.  The idea that there would be *enough* of them to maintain our filthy world is unlikely.  Sure some will see the importance of trashmen and other dirty jobs... but it will take years before *enough* of them do.  

They could survive, but it would not be at the current level of technology due to the loss of maintenance knowledge.  "

I look up, and on the other side of the room is a cloud of weed smoke, illuminated by a lamp which is facing my direction, so at first all I can see through the smoke are silhouettes of my roommate and some other guys sitting around the coffee table, which is covered in power tools and disassembled airsoft guns.

**Alcoholics Anonymous**

1. You're an alcoholic 

2. 12 steps can save you

**/r/NoFap**

2. Fapping makes you lethargic. Stopping can save you.

**Scientology**

1. Glornaks have invaded your brain making you sad

2. Lord Zthar can save you from them

**Nazis**

1. Jewish people are causing corruption

2. Killing them/Unifying Germans can save us


___________________________________________________________


All societies and organizations pull people in using the same method. It's no surprise that there are ridiculous subcultures along with sensible subcultures. Education is a sensible subculture of people ""fixing stupidity/ignorance"" by enlightening themselves with logic and learning. 

People are desperate to fix themselves. According to ourselves, we're riddled with issues and we want an explanation/solution (usually something to blame). Everyone finds something to comfort them. At the end of the day, it's probably all an illusion. We blame this and that for our issues. ""Oh SIN makes me bad"". ""Oh fapping makes me lazy"". ""Oh the Jews/Blacks/Asians/Whites are keeping me from succeeding"". 

These organizations are just fronts for a larger cause to better ourselves. They all have similar tenants: be good, work hard, learn, study, improve, justice, fairness, equality.... Even [Nazis had relatively normal goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_Program) after attempting to unify Germany (killing was step 1 &amp; 4). It's not weird at all to find this subreddit exists. And I don't blame the people who use it. It's just one attempt at self-improvement. No matter *how* misguided the attempt may be, it's quite normal.

As long as they aren't hurting anyone...

"I'm a new driver. I've gotten two speeding tickets. The first wasn't a big deal, but it was $200, and right before I lost two of my three jobs. I couldn't pay it. Got a warrant for my arrest and eventually was caught speeding again. Got thrown in the city jail while waiting for my pastor/boss to come pay my fines to get me out of jail. Eventually my court date for my recent ticket comes around and the judge looks at me and my file, assesses a fine of about $200, then says ""Oh wait, I can charge you more for this."" He would not listen to my request for some leniency. He did not care that I had recently been in the hospital and that I had medical bills pending. He literally told me that I would have to pay the city first because the hospital wouldn't put me in jail for not paying. They quite possibly saved my life, but they are apparently a lower priority than the court. I wasn't even asking that the fine be waived, I just wanted it to be reasonable. That judge did not care. He was only focused on me learning the lesson that those few hours of jail time, personal debt to my boss, and impound fees had already taught me.

Earlier today I nearly freaked out because a police car nearly didn't see me and nearly merged into me. I didn't nearly freak out because of the potential damage an injury. I nearly freaked out because I felt like such an incident would destroy me legally and financially regardless of fault.

I feel very unsafe around police officers. I feel like they're looking for an excuse to lock me up. I used to have a deep respect for them, but that's very hard to maintain when my life has been fucked over by such small things."

"You did the right thing. You shouldn't feel that way going into a marriage, it's something you should be sure about.

Prior to dating my husband, I was always a little commitment-phobic and I would get this sick feeling whenever a relationship got too serious. I lived with an ex and I remember feeling like I might throw up the day we signed our lease. I just knew it was wrong.

With my husband? No doubt, no hesitation. It felt right from the start. I knew I'd marry him and for once the idea of it didn't make me sick or scared. On our wedding day, I felt nothing but absolute joy. We had a lot of little things go wrong (including a small fire in the church DURING THE CEREMONY, plus our ride to the reception accidentally leaving us behind) and noting fazed me. I just laughed.

Bottom line, listen to your gut. Husband's relative told us he wished like hell he'd listened to his and saved himself a lot of grief.

"Anyone who has gone apartment-hunting will be familiar with this one.

Let's suppose that you can afford to spend $1000 a month on an apartment. You'll soon learn that everything in your area will cost $1100, $1200, or even more. Every so often, you'll stumble on a place that costs about $1050, and you'll think that *maybe* you can make it work... but by the time that you can schedule a viewing, you'll discover that it has already been rented.

Then, you'll see it: Nestled between two prohibitively expensive places, you'll find a listing for $850. The pictures will make it look beautiful, and the description will be equally enticing. Better still, the landlord will want to rent it immediately, thus explaining the significantly lower price. Everything will seem perfect - *better* than perfect - with one small caveat: You won't be able to actually see the inside of the place, because the current tenant has yet to move out.

You'll reply to the advertisement.

You'll be told that you've been accepted, and that you'll receive your key as soon as you send your check.

You'll never see your money again.

"As a corrections deputy and an EMT I hit the body fluid trifecta in about a half an hour. Told the sergeant I was leaving for the day and didn't give a shit if he gave me permission. 

First I responded to an inmate having a grand mal seizure. Kept his head from bouncing off the concrete until EMS got there. He'd puked twice but we could hear it coming so we'd roll him over to ensure he didn't aspirate. The third time we didn't hear anything - boom vomit all over my face, up my nose and in my mouth. Swapped out head-staying detail with a nurse and scrubbed my face ASAP while trying not to puke myself. 

About ten minutes after I finished cleaning myself up enough that I didn't want to blow chunks, I got a call to check the vitals of a drunk guy who'd just been brought in to see if he needed to go to the hospital or if he was alright to stay in jail. And he was cranky and bleeding. 

I showed up and he's already yelling at anyone who will listen. I get him to calm down enough to take his vitals but really he just wanted me to get close enough to hit. While I'm checking his blood pressure he takes a swing at me and the fight is on. I get his blood all over me in the quick scuffle and in the end I get him wrapped up on the ground. I hear him start laughing hysterically and I notice it feels warm all over my right side, which is laying on the ground. He's pissing. And I'm covered in it. In an adrenaline surge I stand us both up while still keeping his arms locked and get him into a drunk cell. 

I tell the sergeant a nurse can make a call from the window because fuck it, I'm going home and drinking beer for the rest of the day. He replies ""Your shift isn't over yet!""  I tell him if I stay here I'm giving him a hug so he can enjoy being covered in someone else's piss, vomit and blood. He doesn't say a word and I drop the mic on my way out. 

TLDR: responding to two medical incidents in the jail, ended up getting puke on my face, someone else's blood all over my uniform and laying in a puddle of about a gallon fresh drunk pee while fighting the guy who was the source of said pee. "

His initial plan was to have Harry get the prophecy from the shelf, his followers to steal it from Harry and then he never needs to show up in public to confirm that he has returned. This way the Ministry and the public will continue to ignore signs of his return and call Dumbledore a crazy old man and Harry an attention seeking child. 

He ended up showing up anyway when the plan was botched by Lucius and his other followers, but that wasn't in the original plan."

"It wasn't technically a rule, but teachers essentially made it into a rule. Ok, so my high school got a fat ass grant for some shit idk, and ignoring all the shit my school should have spent the money on, they instead spent it getting the newest iPads for all the students. Now, they said you didn't *have* to get one seeing as how you had to pay 50 fucking dollars to rent one for the year but the teachers told us that they would have us take tests, quizes, turn in homework online, etc. on them and if you even thought about not getting one just about every single teacher would ask you why and publicly hound you 'til you got one. Few months down the line, the whole thing is a failure because, well, teachers are just as lazy as students and technology is something different for most of these people. Then, there's also the fact that because we sometimes would have free time we would play games on them or watch videos/ listen to music (just about anything even remotely entertaining) and teachers and parents alike didn't like the fact that entertainment was the only thing the iPads were actually useful for which lead to about everything being blocked. Literally everything. If you could google something and it not being blocked  or watch a video on some jank ass foreign website (YouTube was blocked smh), it was a good day for those things. "

They didn't actually know *how* to do in school suspension so they just put me in a closet. Literally. They put a desk and a chair in a storage closet used by the administrative offices with my assignments and I had to sit in there all day all by myself. Unfortunately it was also the supply storage closet so, I helped myself and one of the things they kept in there were all of the hall passes, early release passes so I stole a lot of those and sold them to other kids.

Only you do that on too many things and you realize it all adds up.

"I think the point of magic in the Harry Potter universe is that aside from the ""wave your wand and use phrases"" stuff, the deeper magic depends on intent much more than mechanism. What I mean is that for the powerful spell that was being cast to bring Voldemort back to life, Harry's blood needed to be taken forcefully. Voldemort got around this by having Wormtail stab Harry's arm, but I could argue that in that case Wormtail was just acting as an extension of Voldemort's wishes. Therefore, the spell worked. Again, this is because magic relies on powerful forces of intent and meaning and much less on saying things and following a recipe. "

"To answer #4: Menopause is when a woman's body starts slowing down on the production of female hormones. You know how you have testicles? Those produce testosterone. The female equivalent is ovaries and those produce estrogen as well as a couple of other hormones that help a woman's body do woman things. Female hormones are responsible for the menstrual cycle (and because of this they're also mostly responsible for pregnancy - there's a lot of contributing factors to pregnancy), breast development, lack of facial/chest/back hair, and other fun things. So the ovaries stop producing these hormones roughly around a woman's mid-40's and, as with most things, it varies from person to person. Typically a woman will start skipping periods, experience hot flashes, have mood swings, and a host of other issues. Also, pro-tip, it's a very sensitive subject with a lot of women around that age and it's not something that should be brought up.

Tl;dr: ovaries start putting out less female hormones, like estrogen, which means no more child bearing."

It first started with the running, imagine showing up to high school for your first day, and instead of trying to act nonchalant or cool, or even the usual nervous type, you sprint from one class to the next, through the parking lot on your way out, and in the cafeteria. He would run everywhere in a dead sprint, ninja style with his hands behind his back. It was very weird. Teachers would yell at him to slow down, but he would continue chugging along, unfazed. So that was pretty funny, but then started to get really weird. It's pretty common for girls to buy each other balloons when its someone's birthday, and I would estimate that, at least once a week, there's a girl walking around our school with seven or eight balloons. Well, he noticed this pretty quick, and began going up to the girls with a pair of scissors, asking their permission to cut one of the balloons off and keep it for himself. Sometimes they let him, but if they said no, he would follow them around school, begging for them to give him ""just one balloon."" This went on for about half the year, and eventually, we found out why he was doing that. Supposedly, in middle school, he really liked this girl, and I'm not sure she liked him back or not, but she ended up moving away somewhere. To send her off, he got a bunch of balloons, of various type and color, and apparently she liked it a lot. After she moved, he missed her a lot, and was heartbroken, but he still wanted to make her happy, so he tried to send her more balloons. The thing is, you cant mail inflated balloons, so, rumor has it, he was collecting hundreds of balloons and letting them deflate in his closet, with the intention of one day mailing the hundreds of deflated balloons to her in one gigantic present. His parents didn't want to buy him any more, so he resorted to having to beg for them, and it drove him crazy. On top of that, he was just really, really weird. I'm thinking he must have had some form of functioning Autism, or an antisocial disorder. He ended up getting kicked out of school towards the end of the year after he starting carrying around a really suspicious wooden box and saying. ""Soon everyone will pay for their sins."" No one knows if he ever said that there was a bomb in it or not, but rumor spread like wildfire that he was going to blow up the school with the box. The principal ended up calling the cops, and he was arrested. It turns out that all that was in there was a replica of a Portal 2 gun, but the Principal suggested that it would be better if he didn't return to school. We never saw him again. Sometimes we still mention Balloon Boy though, wondering what ever happened to him."

"I used to do freelance video production work, mostly as a grip till P2 came out and I was more useful as a data manager. Joke about those DSLRs all you want, the ""prosumer"" grade equipment is killing the business either way. A good crew with good equipment is expensive, and being able to go to the local electronics store and buy a Rebel for less than the day rate of even a single rookie crew member *looks* like the better deal to many potential clients.

Trouble is, even though it's nowhere near as good as even a budget crew for a few thousand, it's still putting those guys out of work. As good as modern equipment is getting, it's pretty easy to understand why someone would hire an art school dropout with a DSLR instead of a full crew with the right gear.

I tried to stay calm and explain that *he* should really look before pulling out into faster traffic, but after he kept yelling and waving his arms at me I ended up bellowing, ""Oh, why don't you just go fuck your sister, you hillbilly-looking cunt?""

"Mayday is one of my favorite shows and I saw an episode about this a week ago. Dude, the guy was sucked out of the plane then slammed against it and pummeled by 300+ mph winds, exposed to sub zero temps (I believe it was -17 degrees) for 20+ minutes, no oxygen for about 2 minutes and with attendants holding onto the broken legs and everything else. It was absolutely insane that the guy lived.

The scariest thing? The crew believed the pilot was dead. There was no way anyone could survive that, right? The pilots body hanging out of the window like that almost caused the plane to crash because his legs were tangled in the yoke and causing the co-pilot to struggle for control of the plane. The flight attendants wanted to let the body go - but the co-pilot said no, afraid that his body would fly into the engine of the plane.

Thankfully, they didn't let him go."

I had tons of doll clothing and I would make sure they were all dressed for the weather, if it was hot they wore shorts, if it was cold they would all wear sweaters.  I would tuck them in every night and make sure that not one slept without a blanket! Problem was though is that I had around 80 stuffed animals, they would pile up on my bed and hardly leave room for me.This use to stress me the fuck out, when I would go on vacation I would cry the night before because I thought they were going to die without me. Whenever I would go over to friend's houses I would feel sad because they weren't taking care of their animals and I thought those ones were gonna die, I even stole one animal from a friend and I still have it.

Our lips are sensitive. Very sensitive. Babies put things in their mouth as a way of learning about the world because their lips are more sensitive than their hands are capable at that point. Our lips are sensitive which makes them a pleasurable spot on our body when manipulated properly.

So kissing is letting people into our personal, protected, vulnerable areas to press sensitive bits together. It's very intimate in nature. Kissing is like sex but with less genitals."

"When I was around 10 or 11 I think, my friend and I went for a bike ride. We were neighbours and lived out in the country. We were on a particularly empty road, mostly woods and fields,  not a lot of houses or people around. A large commercial van, the kind with the large rolling door at the back, if I recall correctly was parked at the side of the road. My friend and I rode closer and the driver was out of the van and he asked us if we wanted some water. We said no thanks. He told us it was no bid deal, he had lots in the back of his van. We just said no again and turned around and rode our bikes back home. I don't remember even telling my parents about it, like by the time we got back home we went in the pool or something and totally forgot about it. I can only imagine why this guy was trying to get two young girls into the back of his van.... It makes me cringe everytime I think about it.

"Unpopular opinion time.

I'm all for paying teachers a fair wage. And some places don't pay a fair wage. But where I live, first-year teachers make about $45k a year. Which is fairly comparable to what I make. Only I don't get summers off, Spring Break, Christmas Break, Thanksgiving Break, about 6 other days off PLUS 10 personal days.

Now I'm not complaining about what I make. I chose the job I wanted, knowing I'd never get rich off of it (although I make more than enough to support myself). And I appreciate the work that teachers do. But it's not like their salary was a surprise to them. All in all, teachers here get a pretty good deal. Especially when you consider that some teachers, near the end of their careers, are making $60-70k per year.

Plus, I don't know a single group of people in the whole world that gripes about their salaries more than teachers. All my friends from college that are teachers share things about how underpaid they are several times a year, and frankly it just gets old.

But schools should definitely be paying for all of teachers school supplies. It's ridiculous to expect teachers to pay that out of pocket."

"worked at a movie theatre and we had a guy who would purchase an IMAX ticket and use his loyalty card to get the points. (Usually he would purchase it at a kiosk) and I kid you not would come asking for a refund less than 5 minutes after the purchase. How the loyalty system was set up was that the points would not be refunded also. so he did this a few times just to get a free movie coupon. 

Pretty easy to catch it because we noticed the time the ticket was purchased after we refunded it. sent it up the ladder to corporate. his loyalty account was canceled and they changed the system to refund points also. "

"Its called *""the sex-trouble graph"".* 

Let me explain. Any chick youre hanging out with, you can write on a scale of 1 to 10, how good in bed she is - 1 sucks. 10 is amazing. 

You can also write how much trouble she is - 1 is the perfect girlfriend - never bitches, never is an asshole. 10 is a colossal disaster. A real bitch.

Now if you have a graph like - Sex= 7, trouble = 3. You have a nice girlfriend. You've got what we call a *good graph.*

However, If the sex you are getting is a 2 and the trouble youre getting is a 5, you've got yourself a *bad graph*. Get rid of the girl.

Problems do arise if you get sex that is a 9.5 and trouble that is an astronomical 11. Normally, as soon as the trouble gets over the sex, you've got a bad graph. You get rid of the chick. 

But hell, where are gonna find close to 10 sex?? 

Thats a tough call. Thats what we call a , *""difficult graph"".*

Business guys will call this type of a system a , ""cost/benefit analysis"". They base their value scale on money, we base it on pleasure.

"Tldr my first rebound was a male trainwreck with the emotional maturity of a 13 year old girl. 

I broke up with my first boyfriend and had my first rebound (red flag #1). He, my rebound, was also just out of a 5 year relationship (#2) and it was, I found out, extremely abusive (#3). Once i got to know the kid on a romantic level (as we'd been friends for a while) I wanted out. He was way too clingy, easy to become jealous, followed me everywhere, wanted to meet my parents, and at the same time was terrified I'd leave him. I told him ""This isn't working for me"" flat out. 

At first he took it ok. We weren't officially dating, and I told him I just wasn't feeling it with him. I also told him he definitely had some issues after his previous relationship and to get help (his ex was extremely controlling, and he was so used to emotional manipulation and abuse that he kept expecting me to be mad at him all the time). 

Then he kept texting me that he missed me. That I was the one. Then he started taking my stuff so I would have to talk to him to get it back. We had friends in common, and he wouldn't go on outings if I *wasn't* going, and if i stayed home he found me at my dorm. Then he cornered me in a room and attempted to physically keep me from leaving ""so we could define the relationship"", so I knocked him down and left (we were the same size, and I warned him several times to move, or I'd make him move). He somehow found out I was studying with a male classmate a lot and sent me an email wishing me ""All the happiness with classmate that you couldn't find with me"" and it had a picture of the two of us studying in the room attached. I told him to fuck off and never contact me again. After that if I saw him in public, he'd suddenly shut down and get mopey like I'd kicked his favorite puppy. Everyone picked up on it, but ignored it. Then he started dating another girl who I hear is also controlling, manipulative and abusive. 

We were romantic for less than a week. I'm glad I came to my senses within days. Because it was two months of absolute bullshit. I think he just wanted someone who would 'wear the pants' and drag him by his ear everywhere, and I wanted to date a person, not a talking doll. "

He got to class (late, as usual), saw that no one was there and the lights were out, and left to go who knows where. When the teacher and the class went back to the room, they had the office tell him to go to the usual classroom over the loud speaker (so the whole school could hear it).  When he got back to the room, he found everyone sitting and working as though everything was normal. "

"To crush your enemies, to see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of their women."
"The swindler was headed upstairs to visit his friend, the forger. The bird he passed along the way was the forger's homing vulture, which was en route to the forger's publisher to make a delivery. Unfortunately, the poor bird had to fly down the stairwell to ground level and out the open terrace since the forger's apartment had no windows. She was carrying some rolled up paper on which her owner had written the perfect end to his prized short story, what's delivery was a mission of utmost importance.

You see, the forger was very proud of this story's ending as it unabashedly mocked the last two novellas in a complete collection written by his far more successful literary rival, Condolyssa Blackburn, who had worked to expose the forger's dishonesty by high-hatting his private dealings in said novellas, of which the forger grew thirsty for revenge. This same short story would later assist the forger in framing her for a homicide.

So, the swindler in the stairwell knew of the forger's vulture, but he hated birds and went about swatting and cursing at her for flying around in the building. Though, little did the swindler realize that there was a third crook who had been hiding in the shadows of the stairwell above him. As the swindler rounded the corner and came into view, the young thief named Khan had already lept from the banister one floor up behind the swindler as he planned to knock the swindler down and take his money.

As was indicative of his inexperience, young Khan did not notice the vulture until after he lept from the banister as he was too busy marking the swindler to notice the large bird flying past him on it's way down. The sight of the dutiful bird had caused the swindler to stop and swat and curse, which completely negated Khan's calculated leap, so as he fell toward where the swindler would have been had it not been for the vulture, he joined the swindler in cursing wildly at the bird because she had single-wingedly ruined his plan.

Khan's midair cursing fit caught the attention of the swindler who sighted him, and since Khan was quite green and merely half his age, the swindler immediately began talking down to him, attempting to illustrate how feeble and worthless his attempt to swindle a swindler. Yet, as the swindler turned to continue his ascent upstairs, his pride had hindered him from noticing that Khan had successfully picked the wallet from his back pocket.

Thus, Khan's incredibly embarrassing, albeit successful, incident is now humorously referred to among his fellow con men as the ""greatest con ever botched,"" which is far less mentally demanding than what it was formerly referred to as, which was the ""condescending conned ascending con dissenting condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes ending condescending Khan's descending on dissenting conned ascending con dissenting condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes sending condescending Khan descending condescending condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes ending condescending conned ascending con's dissenting on dissenting condor-sending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes sending condescending conned ascending con's dissenting condor-sending condescending con's descending condor sending condor-sending condescending con's dissenting conte's ending condescending con-dissenting Condi's ending condescending contes on descending condescending Khan's descending"" con.

"When I was a gm of a pizza delivery store, I had a driver come complain about not getting enough hours. I explained that he had had an increasing attitude problem and no one wanted to work with him any more. He responded by throwing his unform shirt at me, screaming, ""I quit!"", and storming out. I guess in his car he decided that wasn't dramatic enough so he came back in to start chucking ranch dipping cups around the restaurant and office I was sitting in. His aim was awful so it was pretty funny. He tried to sue for unemployment about 6 months later. 

Another driver (female) tried to sue for sexual harassment after quitting. She informed us she would be open to a quick quiet settlement. 

At a sister store, a fired employee managed to steal a drop safe by breaking in to the store through the wall of the store next to it. 

When I was just a driver I called in one afternoon to say I was going to be late because I didn't feel well. The manager on duty said it was probably best I didn't come in at all because some s*** was going to go down.

They apparently just abandoned him when a rush hit and he got super overwhelmed (conveyer oven so food just keeps rolling out). He just quietly walked out, never to be seen again. However no one really took notice of his absence until a sizeable amount of food ended up piled on the floor. "

Keep in mind this was during a really bad ice storm a few years ago, and in the country, about a good 15-20 minutes from a town, and wasn't a very busy road. 


""Got called from a woman saying she hadn't talked to her mom in a few days, which was weird since they talked everyday. Went to go check on her, drove up to the address, and saw a truck sittin in gate. Got out and walked up, didn't see anything in or around the truck, decide to walk past. 

That's when I saw it. Old lady was by the mailbox, she fell into a puddle and had literally frozen over. Fire department had to come to basically burn her out. 

Then I decided to walk up to the house after calling in what happened. Door was slightly open, I walked in and announced myself, no answer. Walked around, and her husband had died staring out the window at her. He was handicapped and in a wheelchair, didn't have any power in the house for a week, and didn't have a cell phone. He died watching his wife freeze to death. """

"I was in a grocery store checkout line behind a large asian family with four little kids and a boy I assume was about 12.  He was the only one who spoke english.  The clerk rang up their total, and after applying all of the EBT money they had on their cards and a little bit of cash, they were short $19 and change.  They had a lot of food and diapers- stuff they obviously needed- and the boy started pulling out items to get it under the limit.  It was heartbreaking.  I handed the cashier a $20 bill and told the kid he didn't have to put anything back.  He was embarrassed and grateful.  The cashier smiled.  The bitch behind me said, ""You're only encouraging them"".  WTF.  I didn't say anything to the bitch, only because I was still processing what this family must be going through.

I'm not trying to sound like some bastion of inner peace, but I now realize that all that road rage was a front for my dad's insecurity and anxiety, which college helped me get over.

"It's a lot more complicated than that.  The Phoenix comes back, tony stark makes a device to stop it but it actually ends up splitting the Phoenix into five parts, which go to cyclops, Emma frost, Namor, colossus and his sister, magik.  They become the Phoenix five and basically end up doing tons of amazing shit.  

They solve the worlds renewable energy problems.  They disarm nuclear weapons.  They create new farmlands and solve world hunger.  But it's the Phoenix, so the avengers are basically ""wow this is horrible we have to stop this"" even though the Phoenix five aren't really doing anything horrible.  With the Phoenix split up, they're better able to manage the genocidal urges and whatnot.  

Well basically the actual intended host of the Phoenix (hope summers) is trying to be found and taken by both sides all this time and the two sides are fighting each other for her (x-men vs avengers).  Eventually they get the help of Wanda, the scarlet witch, who is basically the only person able to combat the Phoenix powes they have and they remove the Phoenix from Namor.. And then his part goes to the other four, making them more powerful, but also making the dangerous destructive urges of the Phoenix more powerful.  They end up tricking colossus and magik to fight each other (pretty lazy imo) and then it comes down to Emma and cyclops.  Emma starts to get paranoid because of the Phoenix and her own nature, tries to take cyclops out, he instead takes her out and becomes the new, singular host of the Phoenix.  By this point he has literally everyone fighting him trying to take him out.

Xavier shows up as one of those people and tries to stop him.  Cyclops kills him while fully Phoenix powered and losing control of the power he has and ends up stopped by hope summers and Wanda in the end, but Xavier dies as the main casualty of the event.

It's an awesome premise that was pretty lackluster in a lot of ways, but it had its moments.  It was a fresh take on the Phoenix, at least."

"I've been to quite a few weddings and it's happened at several. It's usually not a full on ""smash"", but smearing icing on the bride's nose. 

All I can think about though is how much her make-up cost to get done, and how it was just ruined. Or, even if she did it herself or her mom/sister did it, it still probably took a lot of time and effort. I don't like it any better when the bride does it to the groom, but at least in my experience that happens a lot less. 

It's just one of this traditions that in my opinion needs to die already, like the groom fishing for his bride's garter belt in front of all their dearest friends and family. It's not cute, it's not original, nobody thinks it's funny. Just stop. "

"Incorrect. Your favorite transliteration is 可口可乐 (Coca Cola), because it might literally be the best transliteration from one language to another ever.

Let's count the ways, shall we?

1. Phonetically, it sounds like Coca Cola (ke kou ke le)
2. The meaning is *perfect*. To translate it roughly: tasty happiness.
3. It's even perfect visually. It has two 可s just like there are two Cos in the original name, and all four characters are very simple, which makes it look visually attractive and also makes it super easy to read even from a distance (on billboards and such).

It's the only case I can think of off the top of my head where a transliteration ends up being clearly *better* than the original while still remaining totally true to it.

Static line jumps are from much lower than regular skydiving, and the chute still provides some drag, so it isn't like they're just free falling from 15,000 ft.

Definitely a real possibility of death though. We had a guy in our unit die in a training jump when his chute failed. This guy had his wings for at least a couple years and had jumped on a pretty regular basis. I had gotten out about a year earlier so I didnt get all the details (i.e. not sure if cigar roll, or some other failure), but it is definitely dangerous, even for experienced jumpers."

Yep, maybe she's on that trendy new gluten-free diet and being a pain about it. *Or* maybe she has Celiac's disease, and ingesting gluten could literally send her to the hospital.

"I work at a uni, and we needed to develop a new system for handing out scholarships in my department that was much more transparent, as we had a history of favoritism and secrecy. I was on the committee charged with making a solution.

"Real person. He was a Liberian warlord. From Professor Wik I. Pedia:

He believed that his nakedness was a source of protection from bullets.[8] Blahyi now claims he would regularly sacrifice a victim before battle, saying, ""Usually it was a small child, someone whose fresh blood would satisfy the devil.""[1]

He explained to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer: ""Sometimes I would enter under the water where children were playing. I would dive under the water, grab one, carry him under and break his neck. Sometimes I'd cause accidents. Sometimes I'd just slaughter them.""[9] In January 2008 Blahyi confessed to taking part in human sacrifices which ""included the killing of an innocent child and plucking out the heart, which was divided into pieces for us to eat."""

"The saddest part to me, is that a depressed person looks happy. Like people having a bad day who aren't clinically depressed usually are obvious, so why aren't people who have a bad day everyday? I suspect part of the reason they are depressed is because they care deeply about other people's view of them (I mean other than that I can't see many other reasons to wear a faux smile). So it's like a feedback loop, you're depressed because your feelings are suppressed so you get even more depressed so you have to suppress more...

Do women use gaze as the primary yardstick to measure how attracted to them a guy is?  Or are there other signals they pay attention to?  I do this at parties also so it's a valid question, maybe I'm shooting myself in the foot if I'm putting out signals that I'm not interested.

"I'm no cop, but my stepfather wanted me to tell his story.  Here goes:

My father got a call about a car crash.  Usually they're pretty bad, but this one was the worst he'd ever seen.  

The car had two parents, and four kids inside.  The parents were pulled out immediately, and neither had serious injuries.  They were both understandably scared about their children, so he put on some rubber gloves and went into the flipped car.  

All of them were dead.  And none were clean deaths.  The youngest's spine was protruding from his back, and the oldest was missing most of his head.  Another had his face mangled by debris, and the last one was  cut in the abdomen by his sestbelt; and there were a fair amount of organs hanging out.  

He had no clue what to do; he didn't want those parents to see that.  So he wrapped them up inside of the car.  When the mother saw the smallest one come out in a bloodied blanket, she fell to the ground and just, screamed.  The father walked up to grab the child, and my stepfather just said ""Sir, I don't think you want to see this,"" and the father just started to wail unlike anything my stepdad had ever heard.  ""I'm so sorry,"" he choked out.  

And after they'd taken the bodies, he was there to clean up and investigate.  While he was searching, he found a small, bloody sock sitting on the ground.  He told me it was the only time he'd ever cried on the job.  In his words, ""I've seen grown men blow their brains out, I've seen people beat their spouse until their face was mush; hell, I even had to reach into someone's chest cavity once to resuscitate them; but I'll never forget those kids.""

We sold some small candies for 5 or 10 cents a piece, and people would come in over and over, buy a candy with a $1 stamp, get their change, leave the store, rinse and repeat until they have enough change to buy alcohol.

"I told them no, I wasn't going to pay for someone else's electricity because of a mistake that wasn't even my mistake. I forget the exact details since it was over 10 years ago. The main problem was that the system at the time was for the apartment management company to call and make the change, and they had not done that. I think I ended up getting the apartment management office to straighten that part out. (They said the person they had working in the office was making a lot of mistakes like that.)

By this point, I had already overpaid a bit, and the electric company ended up refunding me for that. But now that I think about it, I remember they actually sent me a check for too large an amount (which I did not cash), then another check for the correct amount (which I did). They wanted me to mail back the incorrect check, and someone kept calling me urging me to send it back immediately, but they had been such whiny assholes about the entire process that I hung onto it for a month or more, partly just to make their lives difficult too, but also because I had other things to do and fixing their screw-up is not my priority."

"Ok, so this wasn't at friends house but i feel it still might be valid. me and my buddies were staying over at my house (we are about 17-18) , playing video games etc. later on in the night, around 10pm-ish, one of my friends gets a call from his younger brother, me and the other guy see the distress on his face and asks what happened and can we help. to make a long story short, his father had been hitting his mum and the younger brother was trying to stop it all. We then go to his house as fast as we could and try to ease the situation. my one friend who is built like a brick shit house prevented the dad from doing anything else while my friend and i gathered things for the family to stay at my house.

this was the first time anything like this had happened in that family  so it came as a shock to everyone. the next day things quieted down and me and the brick shit house get a call from the dad saying sorry and that he respects us for what we did. i see this guy most weekends, and we act like its all ok, but deep down we both know that their is this giant elephant in the room

P.s. sorry for any grammatical or spelling mistakes, i'm typing this on a phone in a cab

"""May May June"" happened.

/r/atheism was removed from the front page and everyone was kind of okay with it.  But then the mods also decided to start changing a whole bunch of shit in the way /r/atheism works...  /r/atheism before all of this was a place much akin to /r/adviceanimals.  People would go there and post dank memes about how silly those Christians are.  The mods of /r/atheism began to get irritated by this fact, they said nay we must be a place of acceptance.  So they wanted to change things, they wanted to ensure that /r/atheism could become a beautiful place...

They wanted to...  Stop the memes...

So there was a massive scramble, around 2 million people were subscribed to /r/atheism at the time.  Huge backlash from the reddit atheist community because pictures could no longer be posted.  Reddit became a vast sea of rage as new Atheist subreddits were made that ALLOWED the religious freedom to post dank memes.  

[Mods were reshuffled](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1h31ud/may_may_june_the_orville_redenbacher_edition/)

"Well besides my eight generations of sims, seven of which had arranged marriages with other sims created by me (the one who didn't fell in love with another sim when I wasn't watching and got her pregnant out of wedlock). And using fruit to determine the gender of the baby by not allowing the mother to eat anything except apples or watermelon so I could get the desired gender. In other words, I didn't let nature take it's course and I used my power to control every aspect of their existence. 

The sim who wasn't made by me lived a really long time. Like, she lived to see her great grandchild go to his first day of school. I didn't really have anything to do with her anymore, but she was a master artist and writer because I needed her to bring in some income while she was raising children and her husband was at work. 

So after her useful husband died I used the mid life crisis thing to give her new traits, and gave her the insane trait so I could put her in the attic where she could churn out books and paintings without needing to talk to anyone. 

Because a sim didn't fit my original plan for how I wanted my story to go, and overstayed her welcome, I used my divine powers and complete control over her life to make her lose her mind and spend all of her time painting and writing novels alone in an attic. She did this for what must have been decades and when she died, had almost no relationship with the children who she bought new cars and trips to Egypt for. "

1. Partial decapitation in a car accident. A drunk kid hit a small car at high speed, tore the top completely off. Driver's body was still heaving and convulsing in the front seat, brains and tongue splattered over groceries in the back seat.

2. Hugely obese drug dealer goes into his attic to retrieve his stash. This is in Georgia in the summer. Collapses from the heat and dies. Takes neighbors a few days to notice the smell, takes a few more before they figure out where, exactly, it's coming from. The police had to cut a hole in the roof of the house to pull his bloated corpse out. He fell apart into goo as they were doing it. The smell was insane even a quarter mile down the road, once the roof was opened up.

3. Woman who had been killed by a serial killer (unofficially. The cops on the scene said they had seen this sort of thing a number of times so they thought it was a serial killing... was never proven). She was a prostitute and he had beaten her to death and then tightly packed all of her orifices with dirt before dumping her.

4. Train vs Car. A mom tried to beat a train with her kids in the car. Train was too fast. When I got to the scene there was a child's head just sitting on the ground, completely normal except for the fact that is was detached and the body was nowhere in sight."

I seemed to be the only one that recognized her face in the same situation ~twice a month, and that your weight cannot fluctuate baggy pant and top sizes enough times a month to require new scrubs. I told my boss, we caught her in the act and told her she was no longer welcome in the store. 
*Bonus:* Fast forward a couple years, I meet a new friend, go to her house to hang out. I meet her mom.. and sure enough, her mom is the Scrub Scrub and I found out she was a minister, a profession which obviously does not require medical scrubs.

""We left the hot tub and started walking to the hotel room, when you decides it would be ok to take of your swimming shorts and walk naked through reception. The manager came over with a towel to cover you and you screamed in his face ""why is the man always telling me what to do?""

Keep in mind that this is a family that makes in excess of $150K a year asking the husband's employees to give them gifts. Talked up how they were displaying ""good Christian values"". Anyways, the two kids get here, and immediately there are behavioral issues with the older child. I don't know the details, but language and cultural barriers likely played a part. Rather than work through them, the wife decided that the girl wasn't ""a good fit"" and sent her off to live with another family across the country. Didn't even go with her on the plane, just packed her stuff and put her on an airplane to the Midwest. Now the wife doesn't want anyone in town to talk about it, even though everyone knows...

"It's easy, once you get the hang of it! Here's how I play:

Cards You Need:

* 10s
* 9s
* 7s
* 6s
* 2s
* Aces
* Jacks (as many as you have)
* Kings (3 or 4)
* Queens (2)
* Jokers (1)

What The Defensive Cards Do

* **Jacks** - Can be played against Ace-10, removes the card it's played on.
* **Kings** - Can be played on Ace-10, doubles the card it's played on. 
* **Queens** - Flips your deck, so for example if the bottom card is a 10 of hearts, and your top card is an ace of spades, the top card is now the 10 of hearts and you can play off of that.
* **Jokers** - When played against an ace, it removes all cards of that suit. When played against a number card, it removes all other cards of that value from the entire table.

How to Play

* After you've set up selecting my recommended cards, scroll through the deck, select your highest value cards, and place them in each Caravan.
* Build up your caravans with the other number cards, using the face cards (I call them defensive cards) to prevent the other player from building up their caravan.
* Conversely, you can use these cards to overshoot their goal of having cards reach a value of 20-26.
* The other player can use their defensive cards on you, so be careful and try to build a strategy based off repairing your caravans if they're sabotaged with defensive cards.
* You win if at least two of your decks reach a total between 20-26 before the other player reaches this goal.

"Most retail companies have a locked dumpster policy to prevent employees from falsely claiming an item is broken (or giving it just enough minor damage to throw way) and then grabbing it out of the dumpster later. Which is basically a roundabout way of stealing.

Another reason is that once a location becomes a source of income for people, if they don't find anything valuable for a while they may move to stealing the items that are not in the dumpster. For example: My father worked as a supervisor for a construction site. They had a dumpster full of cable and scrap metal that people would take from at night and sell at the recycling plant. Once the scrap was gone they started stealing the cables and other materials that were still being used. By locking the dumpster and putting up some motion lights the location was no longer a source of easy scrap and they had less material go missing. He then cashed in the scrap himself at the end of the project and gave it to the workers as a bonus."
This is true. I was in Vietnam last year when a shark took a massive bite out of the cable. The Internet was really bad for a while.

"At least for college admissions in California prior to the passage of Prop 209 (a ballot initiative which forbade state-funded colleges and universities from considering race in admissions passed in 1996) it didn't do so directly but it did so by proxy. 

While affirmative action here *didn't* penalize whites or Asians by explicitly holding their race against them (it wasn't like, e.g., there was a scorecard where an applicant had to get over 100 points in order to get admitted into a college and being white counted as minus five points while being Asian counted for minus 15). 

Instead, it penalized them by proxy. Since the number of seats per incoming class is limited, students applying to college are applying for a scarce resource (if somebody gets a seat, it means somebody else *doesn't* get that seat.) By boosting the scores of black, Latino, and Native American applicants, it became more difficult for white and Asian students to gain admission into state-funded universities because there were fewer seats available for them. Hence it effectively acted as a penalty. 

Now that affirmative action has been banned in California, the change is visibly evident. IIRC the racial makeup of the student bodies at the top two state schools -- UCLA and Berkeley -- are each around 50% Asian despite the fact that only around 11% of Cali's population is Asian. "
"Not actively searching for sex/relationships. Honestly, I feel like I've gotten it all out of my system, I kinda really like being single. My longest and first relationship was over two and a half years and afterwards I was exploring my sexuality (TL;DR turned out I was bi which is what prompted the end of my first relationship) but now it feels like I've done that, learned about myself and that's it.

A lot of my friends are either in relationships or actively seeking them/one night stands and my outlook gets dismissed quite often as well being viewed as the opposite of what I should want (bisexuals are usually stereotyped as manwhores/sluts). I'm just pretty tired of all the sense of superiority that people in relationships give off as well as the faux ""get tinder/grindr, it's like shooting tail in a barrel"" bullshit. "

"Not thinking about it. 

Most men seem to put minimal thought into what clothing they wear, and most often the decision process tends to go: Level of comfort &gt; Reflection of personality in brand/design &gt; Fashion/fit/style

Problem is you can work backwards from that and look so much more put together. If you start by looking for well made, properly fitting, fashionable clothing, you'll be able to find things that fall in line with a style that personally reflects you, and with a bit of searching you'll find pieces in that vein that are incredibly comfortable as well. No reason to be a schlub in a baggy branded t-shirt, relaxed fit cargo shorts, wearing tube socks and generic running shoes to be comfortable. "

"I'm pretty late to the thread, but I'll post my story anyway, because none of my friends ever believe me.

The year was 1999. I was about to graduate high school, and had only a few weeks left until summer. I woke up one Wednesday morning, got ready for school like always, and went downstairs to snag some breakfast. My mom, being an only parent, was already gone to work, but she usually left me something for breakfast before hand.

I go into the kitchen and see a plate of cooked bacon on the counter. Just like, a whole packages worth of bacon. While this was unlike my mom (it was usually a plate of eggs/bacon/ham/whatever in the microwave, in relatively normal portions), it was a huge pile of bacon, so I just shrugged and nommed a handful on my way out. I also noticed that the frying pan was still on the stove, and this was, again, unusual. My mom was always sort of a neat freak, especially about dishes. I passed it off quickly, thinking, ""Eh, she was probably running late this morning or something."" and headed to class.

Cut to that afternoon, when I get home to my mom first apologizing for not having time to cook breakfast for me that morning (she had been running a bit late, after all), but that that was no excuse to waste bacon and leave out dirty dishes.

She still doesn't believe I didn't make the bacon.

None of my friends believe I didn't make the bacon.

But I swear on my Steam library that I didn't make that bacon.

"I believe it's called a Sambo doll, based on the character Sambo in the 1899 children's book *[The Story of the Little Black Sambo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Little_Black_Sambo)*. ([1931 cover](http://imgur.com/Gw6RRbd) of the book.)

Fun fact (well, not really): In the late 1800s and early 1900s (and perhaps before?), black characters, portrayed as uncivilized and ignorant, were used in children's books and rhymes to teach kids. 

Take the popular nursery rhyme ""Ten Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed,"" for example. It was originally the ""Ten Little Niggers"" (later told as the [""Ten Little Colored Boys""](http://imgur.com/qUkcz8B) in 1942) and was used to teach children counting. 

Here's one version of the rhyme:

&gt;Ten little nigger boys went out to dine;
&gt;
&gt;One choked his little self and then there were Nine.
&gt;
&gt;Nine little nigger boys sat up very late;
&gt;
&gt;One overslept himself and then there were Eight.
&gt;
&gt;Eight little nigger boys travelling in Devon;
&gt;
&gt;One said he’d stay there and then there were Seven.
&gt;
&gt;Seven little nigger boys chopping up sticks;
&gt;
&gt;One chopped himself in halves and then there were Six.
&gt;
&gt;Six little nigger boys playing with a hive;
&gt;
&gt;A bumble bee stung one and then there were Five.
&gt;
&gt;Five little nigger boys going in for law;
&gt;
&gt;One got into Chancery and then there were Four.
&gt;
&gt;Four little nigger boys going out to sea;
&gt;
&gt;A red herring swallowed one and then there were Three.
&gt;
&gt;Three little nigger boys walking in the Zoo;
&gt;
&gt;A big bear hugged one and then there were Two.
&gt;
&gt;Two little nigger boys sitting in the sun;
&gt;
&gt;One got frizzled up and then there was One.
&gt;
&gt;One little nigger boy left all alone;
&gt;
&gt;He went out and hanged himself and then there were None.

"I work in veterinary medicine. I saw a customer get part of his hand bitten off by his own dog. I heard screaming in the exam room next to the one I was in, I go in to help as I find the doctor scooping up human bits off the floor with a sterile urine cup (unused!!) and the other vet tech wearing gloves holding the client's bloodied stump above his head. He was screaming his head off, and his dog pooped, then peed on the poop. I felt it was a good time to call 911, so I did.

Next craziest was when I walked in on the dog groomer sucking the business manager's dick with two fingers in his asshole (her fingers). I just walked out, didn't say anything for two weeks, asked for a raise after that time, citing no reason, and I got one too."

"I've had some weird things happen to me, but the creepiest thing happened during my winter break of my freshman year of college.  

This winter, everything seemed... darker is how I'd put it?  My entire house seemed darker, I was very depressed (I was diagnosed with depression when I was 13 but hadn't been depressed in a long time until this point), my family was snapping at each other more than normal... you get the point.  But the weirdest thing was that I became scared of the dark.  This is weird because I have blackout curtains and am used to falling asleep in pitch-black, cave-like darkness.  But this winter I couldn't.  I would leave the hall light on and my door open, I had to check under the bed and in the closet.  You get the picture.  But there wasn't any reason for me to feel this way, ever.

Now, I live on a fairly large property, so sometimes I will go walking around at night.  I've been doing it forever and though sometimes I've been spooked by a squirrel or something, in general it's fine.  So one night I'm coming back from my walk and I come in and look up to see a man, clear as day, standing in my living room and looking towards my parent's bedroom door.  I can literally describe him perfectly to this day.  He had long hair, was wearing gray jeans, and a leather jacket.  

I froze.  He turned to look at me, smirked, and then just... disappeared.  He was gone.  

I looked everywhere.  I made sure all the doors and windows were locked, and checked under everything and in every room.  No one was there.  So I freaked out, naturally, because what if I had imagined this man in my house??  I couldn't fall asleep and the darkness felt really oppressive and I was shaking and shaking.  

The next day I bought sage and spread the smoke around the house and it instantly felt lighter.  My depression was gone, basically in an instant, and I could sleep normally again.  To this day, I don't know who or what that man was, but I'm constantly vigilant to that feeling.  "

"I work for a large and unpopular-on-Reddit web company.

Our supervisors pretty much always have our backs, and mine more so than most (IMO), but he also... sounds like a complete dick. And he can be. Like, I go the whole 9 yards with empathy and whatnot; if someone asks for my supervisor he usually ends up saying something like ""go back and tell them that I'm not going to do anything differently, and if they still want to talk to me, fine.""

If he does have to get on the call he always approaches it with a ""you're not understanding me here, this isn't going to happen. No, you're not talking to my manager."" ice-cold tone. And when I've had to deal with a really difficult customer, that's always a somewhat schadenfreude end to things."

"Plus vore is purely fantasy and cannot be enacted IRL. I've come across it a few times and I find it weird, but it *is* a fantasy fetish and therefore to me it's harmless. That is assuming it doesn't overlap with real life cannibalism in any way, since there is no possible way to swallow another human whole, haha.

"On a serious note, the origin of this meme is actually based on truth.

Obviously if you put your phone in at 1000W it's going to be screwed. If you have a microwave with a low defrost setting you can induce some charge and you can safely try this for periods less than a minute. Since your phone isn't going to get _much_ charge in a minute it's not really worth the hassle, which is why no-one is using this method. You may get to see a 1% increase in charge though, which is kinda cool.

Ultimately this has no practical use, but it's an interesting concept.

Edit: I think I should legally cover myself against idiots who are going to try this for longer than a minute. Do not actually try this"

"While we're on surprising facts: Sarah Palin never said that--it was Tina Fey parodying Palin on Saturday Night Live.

The actual Palin quote was in response to the question of whether a governor of Alaska had the foreign policy credentials to be president, and her point was that the Alaskan government deals with foreign policy more than some other states. For example, there are places in Alaska from which you can see Russia.

Whether or not you think she was making a reasonable argument, she was in fact saying something true. The fact that we remember the parody more than the politician says a lot about how she was perceived during her fifteen minutes of fame."
"This is especially infuriating! Choosing not to discuss sex is one thing that can irreparably damage someone.

"It's amazing how the human body acclimates to different temperatures. About 5 years ago I went to Jamaica in the middle of December.  Now I live in New Jersey which is hit and miss as far as cold winters go but that year it was pretty cold.  Anyway I'm standing on the beach shooting the shit with this Jamaican dude that works at the resort with the sun blaring down us, I don't know what the temperature was but if I had to guess I'd say it was just a couple degrees below the temperature of Satan's taint.  As we were talking the sun started setting behind the building we were standing next to and a breeze kicked up, I'm thinking thank God my rum might actually stay cold till I finish it.  This Jamaican dude starts shivering and excuses himself.  He goes inside and comes out in a hoodie apologizing saying he was getting a chill.  All I could think of was the movie Cool Runnings with John Candy when they get to Canada.  I told him about it and we both had a good laugh.  Then a couple days later I sunk their sailboat but thats a different story.

"At the start of the Industrial Revolution, the suggestion was that automation would free humans from menial wage labour to pursue intellectual pursuits (art, writing, dance, etc, etc).  The entire point was that firms would become more productive, be taxed appropriately, and those taxes would support a social safety net to provide for the people made obsolete by automation.

That's all well and good, until you realize that second part never came to fruition.  Firms further exploited their employees, and go to great efforts NOT to pay the taxes they owe, which is detrimental across the board.

While it's possible such an evolution will occur, it'll likely start in Europe.  In America, there's such a pervasive sense of anti-intellectualism that any policy that promotes following one's intellectual pursuits would get smacked down hard.   "

This was for hourly contract work not project based as in I worked these hours I was entitled to my pay.

Anyway I remotely removed all my work from the past 2 weeks and reverted it back to how it was before making sure not to cause damage.

"You are not correct about hours minutes and seconds.

There are not records of minutes or seconds until the middle ages, when effort was put into tracking time more accurately. The word minute is from the latin *pars minuta prima* meaning first small part (of an hour), with Second being the Second small part.

The reason Co-ordinates relate to time is because improved navigation was the original intention of more accurate time keeping devices."

"So two years ago I'm working deep in the Louisiana woods, very late at night (around 2am). I am on an oil field location all alone getting a load (there are no lights where I am standing only the red glow of my trailer lights). I am miles from anyone and at the bottom of a hill so there is no cell service and there was no one at dispatch. Well, half way through my load I suddenly, out of nowhere, get this spine tingling chill up my neck. Literally the hairs on my arms and neck stand completely up (this has never happened before, hair 100% stand straight up). My eyes open wide and I get intensely focused. I get this INTENSE paranoid feeling like I'm being watched. I turn my flashlight and shine it frantically on top of my trailer, on top of the tanks, I shine it behind the tanks (besides moving my flash light I am remaining completely still). I get this urge to cut my load short, I unhook and frantically run up into my truck and haul ass. 8 am I get a text waking me up, it's a picture message from the guy that pumps the location, behind the tank battery, 20 feet from where I was standing, were the largest set of cat paw prints sunk into the clay, paws almost as big as my hand. You could see where the cat had been pacing back and forth behind the tanks watching me. That's obviously spine tingling, but the strange part is how I just ""knew"" something was watching me. Like, something deep, passed down for thousands of generations via evolution, was triggered within me. I sensed a large predator stalking me and my body, without my cognitive input, transformed me into an alert fight or flight state. Completely out of thin air. That reminded me that I too am an animal."

I was running some errands and stopped off at the grocery store. I was making dinner for my girlfriend that evening, nothing fancy, just some American chop suey. The only ingredient I didn't have was ground beef. I picked up a pound of the supermarkets finest lean ground and strolled to front of the store. By chance I had traveled down the toiletries/hygiene isle when it struck me. I should pick up some condoms in case tonight takes a turn for the best! I grabbed my favorite brand and proceeded to the checkout isle. The cashier at the check out was a teenage girl, probably 15 or 16. I plopped my two items down on the belt, ground beef and condoms. Halfway between scanning item number one, and reaching for item number two, something clicks in her brain and she looks at me with this peculiar, puzzled, slightly disturbed look. I didn't know what to make of it, and it actually took a second to register. I was in a staring match with a 16 year old naive cashier when it hit me and I blurted out: ""IM GOING TO FUCK THE MEAT!"" She was mortified and I was embarrassed and mad, that my mouth and brain had conspired against me to make me look like a Grade A creep. 

TL;DR: I told a teenage cashier I was going to fuck ground beef with the condoms I was purchasing. "

Smashed the fuck out of my fingers. I whipped my hand out of there, slammed the drawer shut, and started walking down the hallway towards to back to grab some ice out of the freezer. I was so absorbed in continuing the stream of curse words coming out of my mouth, and I was holding my hand up in the air (for some reason I thought the elevation would help the pain).

"Someone told one of my employees from a long time ago that buffalo wings were made from the little yellow chick's wings and drumsticks.  She was convinced and would never eat them because she was a, If I recall correctly, a cuteaterian. Like a vegetarian, but she didn't eat things that were cute when they were alive.  She was alright with eating full size chicken wings, just not the Buffalo wings.

I had to go buy a package of full size chicken wings and cut them into the parts to show her that they were made from the big chicken wings.  Then she was really mad at her dad and uncle for the rest of the night

"Alice in wonderland syndrome. I have never met anyone else who experiences this and it was hard to explain or find info about it until recently

Edit: I thought Id share a story I had when I was a kid where the experience was quite dramatic and intense. Nowadays it happens very rarely and is very mild, but as a child they happened monthly if not weekly.
The worst experience I had was where I was trying to fall asleep, and for some reason I remember everyone in the house had fallen asleep already except for myself (maybe I woke up at some point during the night and this happened I cant be sure right now).
I could remember very vividly how fragile the bed felt, and how scared I was to get off. It felt shaky, and any movement I made would have toppled me over. I also remember how distorted the room looked. We had an air conditioner in the room because of how hot it got during the summer, and it was on and the sound it made as so loud, and I swear it looked like it was pulsating in and out. I was so scared I started to cry to my brother to help me. He woke up and looked at me then went back to bed.
After it sort of calmed down, I walked to my parents room, still having mild symptoms, and started to ask them to help me, but they told me to go back to bed. I remember when I was clutching the door of their bedroom how thin it felt in my hand. I was terrified. 

I walked back to bed, and eventually fell asleep.

I would have brushed it off as a nightmare, but my brother confirmed to me then, and again as an adult, that he does remember waking up and seeing me crying and begging for his help, and I looked so stiff and scared. He never explained why he just ignored me and went to bed, but he did see me which means I wasnt dreaming. 

Anyway, thought Id share an extreme version of what might happen. its never been this bad since, or ever was before."

"Really, seek professional help. Ask a professional about lifestyle changes that can help with your condition. Depression is real and isn't something to try to tough out. You may not need to jump onto meds or other interventions immediately, but you should discuss with a doctor what things you can do to manage the condition. This should be step 1.

Getting sunshine and exercise are things you need to have for good health, depressed or otherwise. Just get out the door. That might be a challenge all by itself, but get outside and moving.

Don't eat garbage. Make sure to eat, get your veggies, take a multivitamin. All sorts of vitamin and mineral deficiencies will manifest as depression. Also hydrate. Being dehydrated will take the wind out of your sails and make you feel miserable. Again, this is stuff you should do anyway as part of normal health maintenance, not necessarily to cure depression.

All this may not be enough to completely defeat depression, but they are things you should be doing anyway for general health and will facilitate any treatment plan."

"Economics student here. Reddit's version of economics is so wrong I don't even know where to begin. 

Between having no idea what currency is, what growth represents, no concept that things cost money even if the government pays for them. No concept.

It's not just redditors though. It's everyone. Nobody has a clue about even the basics because for some godforsaken reason basic finance skills aren't taught in school. I had a lengthy discussion with an uber driver yesterday because he asked me what I studied and I said Economics. ""Too bad economics is bullshit"". My go to response these days is ""people only say that when they don't understand the basics"" which is true. I digress.

Here's a study with people's willingness to cut spending in individual areas of government. http://www.people-press.org/2011/02/10/fewer-want-spending-to-grow-but-most-cuts-remain-unpopular/

Everyone knows that governments tend to spend more than they earn (which isn't in itself necessarily bad. Jury's out on what that though, even in the economics world. General consensus is to keep a debt-to-gdp ratio stable) but when pressed which things they would cut specifically they would either increase or keep funding for almost ALL areas of expenditure.

You know where most people think we can cut spending? Foreign aid. Which personally I agree with. But the thing is if that even if you cut foreign aid completely you would only save about 1% of the government spending. Which really isn't enough. 

But I mean, ask yourself the same questions. Should we cut spending to healthcare? Education? Infrastructure? Policing? Should we raise taxes. Most people say no to every single one of those questions. Except the tax one, just tax the rich/poor if you are poor/rich. Just don't tax me

SOMETHING HAS TO GO if we want to maintain our lifestyle OR we need massive amounts of growth to our economies. So reddit, if you want things like basic income that means fracking, that means allowing corporations to lobby governments for corporate interests. You can't have one without the other because economic growth and economic luxury and economic prosperity are all one in the same. So decide: do you want to live a comfy first world life that is better than your parents' and was fueled by technological innovation and want your kids to do the same? Or do you want to cut spending and live within our present means? They're two equally valid options, but you cannot have both.

Apparently this makes me a sociopath. I know I'm gonna get downvoted for this but you asked what makes me different. My views on economics and the world are pretty radically different than the stuff you typically see on here.

"One night in college I got really, really, really, absurdly drunk. In my stupor I saw a sign for a speed dating even going on on campus and decided it sounded like a good idea. 

So I grabbed my room mate and said ""let's go,"" without telling him where we were going and took off. 

I do not remember ever making it to said speed dating event, however a few weeks later I got an email from a girl whom I supposedly met at this speed dating thing, which my room mate confirmed did in fact happen,  saying she wanted to see me again for a second date.

I have no idea who this woman is, what she looks like, what her name is, anything. So I decided to say fuck it and agree to a second date.

Here's where the magic happens. I decided that if drunk me was good enough to get a second date,  he can probably also get me a third. So I down some more liquid wingman and head out.

We meet at McCallisters on campus and I order a triple grilled cheese sandwich and a side of mac n cheese. Cause I'm smart and belong in college.

We eat, we chat,  I realize we have very little in common and while this woman is very nice and admittedly good looking, she is the polar opposite of what I would look for in a significant other. There's this awkward cloud hanging over the table the entire time we eat, nothing is going well, we finish and leave with barely more than a goodbye.

I go to my dorm room and realize I just ate way too much cheese and spend the next hour giving birth to what I believe was a thumb sized nugget of pure calcium.

My step-father worked traffic homicide for years, and encountered any number of frankly gruesome things, but the story I remember really sticking out in my mind involved a car hitting a electric pole on a rainy night.

The electric pole was severely damaged, one of the lines breaking and falling down to rest in a puddle - which now also contained the severed head.

Jim does, and lo and behold it tastes like coke. Jim has a couple of these apples and starts getting a buzz. He says to the bartender ""hey man, you know how to make a screwdriver? ""

Richard Linklater (Boyhood, Dazed and Confused, School of Rock) actually directed an adaptation of Tiede's story in 2011, [here's the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJuhWKcY_6U).  The film was called *Bernie*, appropriately enough.  Jack Black, in what is probably my favorite role of his, played Tiede.  He really was *very* good in it.  To be completely honest, I had no idea he could pull off a role like that.  It also stars Shirley MacLaine and Matthew McConaughey, who both turn in fantastic performances as well. It's a fascinating story and worth a look, for sure.  

  
  
It's on [Netflix US](https://www.netflix.com/title/70189906), if anyone is interested in checking it out. I highly recommend it if you're into quirky, off-beat, character studies or true crime films, though this is a bit more light-hearted and more of a black comedy, in my opinion.

"I worked at a fashion magazine for about a year and would constantly get screamed at for the most ridiculous, uncontrollable things. The final ""fuck it"" moment (and I had these moments at least twice a week) was being berated in front of a closet full of wide-eyed interns about how I should have predicted that Italy was going to change their customs requirements (literally the day before I made the shipment, was not notified by anyone about the change). I was told that all customs agents and UPS employees are idiots, and that I should have been proactive and assumed that they were going to make these exact changes so that an ugly pink sequined dress could have arrived somewhere at 8pm that day, instead of 8am the next morning. I marched right into our managing editor's office not 5 minutes later and quit. Felt so damn good."

"Any time someone mentions ""the asshole that runs to the end of a merge lane when traffic is backed up"", someone will post about the zipper merge. 

The zipper merge is not the answer you think it is. You merge when traffic is moving. PERIOD. You cannot merge when traffic is at a complete stop. You know what stops traffic from moving? The guy that tries to get to the VERY end before merging. 

Could be that the zipper merge is working beautifully- people merge about 50-100 feet before the lane ends. 

But then there's that ONE fucking guy that says ""screw this! i can go another 50-100 feet and get ahead by another 10 cars!"" and then butts in, causing traffic to come to a stop, ruining the zipper merge. And then just as it gets moving again, there's another one of those guys. 

We are talking about the same thing. EVERYONE wants the zipper merge to work. But it NEVER FUCKING WILL because of these types of people. I've been driving for most of my life. Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of miles. I have NEVER seen this ""zipper merge"" pulled off successfully because of all the assholes out there. It's ok to hate them. They are THE worst. "

"I respect your frustration with infinity symbol tattoos and definitely agree that pinterest is horrible about convincing people to get the same tattoos. That being said, my first tattoo was a small infinity symbol I got several years ago when I was 18. It was before the massive pinterest craze and it was a tattoo that I'd wanted for a long time. I gave my tattoo artist creative control over the design and was very pleased with what he drew up for me. 

Do I sometimes feel a bit embarrassed now that the infinity tattoo has become so common/trendy and people ask me if I got the idea from pinterest? Definitely. I don't regret the tattoo though and still love it. But I don't think I'd redo it had I known it was going to get so popular.  "

"Cop here. Not the worst crime scene but an interesting one. I was dispatched to a call where the wife found her husband unresponsive in his office. I show up, the room is dark, and I find the man in his chair in front of his computer screen. The screen is off but I can hear that the fan on the PC is still running. Anyhow, the guy is elderly and is obviously dead. His right hand is seized up into a jacking off position and his fly is down with the vienna sausage limp and exposed. Obviously this dude had a medical episode while whacking the weasel. At this point the wife is completely unaware of the circumstances surrounding her husbands death due to the room being dark, his close proximity to the desk, and her reluctance to approach the body. Sometime passes, the ME shows up with body removal, and the guy is wheeled away. As I am wrapping up the scene and the wife is in another room with family, my curiosity gets the better of me. I know for a fact that at his age the guy needed some visual stimulus at a minimum to prime the pump. Remembering that the computer was on, but the screen had shut off, I reached for the mouse. When I moved the mouse, the screen turned on to holy dear god of all that is horrible on the Internet. Let's get one thing straight, as a male, I have seen my fair share of what is out there in the naked world, but what popped up on that screen was about 20 open tabs of the darkest porn the darkest parts of the web has to offer. What struck me most was the amount of painful looking gay torture porn this guy had open. Not going to lie, at this point I felt like a teen again afraid my mom was going to walk in at any moment. I was at a cross road. Do I break the news to his grieving wife and family a couple rooms over? Heck no! I closed all those tabs and hoped this guy was browsing on private. To dead guy: I hope that I was a bro for you even though I didn't know you. And if anyone ever finds me in that same situation please do the same for me. RIP dead guy."

"Thanks, he was awesome. 

I have a million stories. Let me try to pick just one...

Ok.  

One of the things he did to make others comfortable was use humor that he thought would appeal to them. He was a pastor, so he'd be pretty official from the pulpit, although he'd still make the congregation crack up at least once a sermon. But then with us kids, he'd literally make fart jokes. Lol. Then if my grandma or some other grown up walked by, he'd say all loud and obvious, ""You all need to cut that out. We're at church now this is serious business."" Soooo funny. But it made the kids in his church feel comfortable, like Pastor was their own grandpa.
 

One more. 

He was really sick with cancer for years, and he was sick with heart disease before that.  So, he spent a lot of time in the hospital. 

He always made it a point to learn the names of everyone from the orderlies to the surgeons. When anyone would help him, even with something little like emptying his trash bin or getting him some ice water, he would make a note of it with the person's name in a little notebook he always kept with him. 

Then, when he'd be ready to go home, he'd write a letter mentioning all the people that helped him, and how grateful he was for it, and how it made him feel like he was ""bunking at the Ritz instead of an old hospital."" Since he had kept that list, he was able to mention specific things people did (he called them ""acts of great kindness"".) Then he'd give it to the head nurse or whoever. 

I once mentioned how nice it was for him to do that. He said, ""No, well, it's not nice, really. It helps *me* more than anything. Instead of fussing about being sick in the hospital I can focus on how well I'm being treated and how much people are a blessing to me."" 

Of course, all the staff at the hospitals loved him. When he died, it was just like a dramatic scene in a movie: a whole bunch of his family were gathered around his bed, singing hymns and telling him it was OK to go, that he had helped us so much and we loved him so dearly. 

But the remarkable thing was that some of the nurses and other staff were there, too. I mean, several times, I'd look through the window in the hall and see two or three people in scrubs standing there with red eyes and tissues. It really struck me because these were people who dealt with death every day. It's not like he was a kid or a tragic accident victim or something: he was an old guy with cancer. 

OK just _one_ more. 

When he passed, one of the nurses asked if I was his grandkid. I said yes, and she told me that he had been one of her very first patients after nursing school in a different hospital, years ago. She said that she had always remembered him because he was so kind. Then she said that when she saw his chart in her unit, she was super sad (ICU, with the same cancer as before so obviously she expected it to have progressed.) When she went into his room, he was sleeping and she was just doing whatever nursing thing. She had her back turned, and she heard him wake up and ask if he could have some water or something. 

When she turned around, he smiled really big, and said, ""Linda?! Man alive! Am I ever glad to see you. You see how bad off I've been without your help?"" (Implying that his worsened condition was because he hadn't had her for his nurse.) She was cracking up and sobbing at the same time when she told me about it. :,-)

(Her name wasn't Linda. Actually, I can't remember, now. :( )

Anyway, he remembered her name after all those years, and made a joke to make her more comfortable and pay her a compliment..from his actual death bed. This guy, whew.

"I can second this. One night in DC I got separated from my group looking for a hookah bar we went to the weekend before. I was asking people on the street where this place was because its entrance was in an alley. So I ask these guys where this place is, and they tell me to follow them. We start talking and they give me the nickname Ricky Bobby for whatever reason. I start seeing that we are getting close to the end of the business area and getting into a residential part. 

I started to get a weird feeling that they aren't taking me where I want to go. Went from drunk to sober in an instant. As we are getting away from the the people that are out and about, it became harder to break away from those two. I remember that a group of girls were pulling out of a car garage and they were blocking the sidewalk. The guys instantly start cat calling the girls. I remember that one of the guys opened the rear passenger door to talk to one of the girls. The girl wasn't feeling it but I suddenly had the urge to hop in. So I did. 

When I hopped in, I knew it threw the girls for a loop. I can't blame them; who hops in a strangers car for a ride? I remember slamming the door and just tell them to drive and drop me off a few blocks down. Ended up missing the metro and walked most of the way home, about 30 blocks.

TLDR: Don't go walking of with random people, especially while under the influence :)"
"Well, at least this wasn't the top post like it normally is. It's still completely wrong though. There is no timeline altering in Harry Potter - All the events that happen after Harry and Hermoine go back in time in Prisoner of Azkaban happen the first time around, but the characters and the reader don't know about it yet. If you went back in time and tried to do something that couldn't have possibly happened, i.e., kill Voldemort before he rose to power, there would be something that stopped you. I don't know what something, but something would definitely stop you by virtue of the fact that Voldemort wasn't killed before he rose to power. "

"For context: We have two holes down there. The vaginal canal, where period bits and babies come out. Then above that is a hole called the urethra. That's where urine comes out. 

The clit, by the way, is basically a mini penis. Spongey tissue fills with blood to swell when a woman is aroused. The hood, much like foreskin, draws back some. 

Also, men have nipples because in the first, I think 6, weeks, a baby is coded to be female. The penis and gonads form when the genetic structure tells the body to start forming. The gonads (ovaries, in this case) fall to create the testicles. The scrotum is just the labia stretching and fusing over the testicles, and the penis is more or less the clitoris growing and changing slightly.

I think that's the most commonly unknown facts about the body. Lemme know if I missed any. (Also, not trying to be a smart ass, just trying to help.)"

"How they build a fire. 

If they can't get it started without getting frustrated (given normal circumstances) they won't have the patience to be good in bed. 

If they just dump gas or lighter fluid on a pile of sticks they don't invest time to do things right. 

If once the fire is started and they go to stoke it and you can tell everytime they try they just make it worse instead of better; they can't see their flaws and therefore can't make adjustments to fix their problems let alone to improve their good qualities. 

A guy who gets his supplies ready takes the time to place them in just the right place and then blows just right to get the fire blazing and then can anticipate just when to stoke and how to stoke to keep the fire at just the right size is a guy who is going to put in the right effort and moves in sex.

Other beers with similar alcohol and more calories include Milwaukee's Best, Busch, Rolling Rock, Miller Genuine Draft, Miller High Life, and Old Milwaukee.

"It is possible that by taking a staunch stance against drinking, you may miss out on some things in life. For example, it's not uncommon for business to be discussed over a few beers after work. It could potentially hurt your professional career, depending on what you do obviously. Also, some people are put off by such attitudes because they think you are inadvertently saying you are a better person than them because you don't use harmful substances. Just be aware of the consequences. Something as simple as having 1 beer a week with coworkers or friends could positively affect your life in ways you might not even realize.

"&gt; Not a pilot, but I am a gate agent. Most recent one I can think of is when the nose gear steering failed in mid-air due to some computer glitch. Essentially upon landing the pilots would be unable to steer, meaning they could veer off and end up in the dirt so to speak.
We learned about this a few hours prior to arrival and the Captain declared and emergency. Declaring is pretty standard with this stuff as it allows them to have priority landing and allows us to pre-position equipment to tow it off the Runway if needed. Luckily we had wind directly across Runway 27 so we didn't worry too much about the aircraft veering off.
Ended up being not a huge issue, the FO reset the computer on touchdown and they regained steering. We delayed the flight for 12 hours based on ""Mechanical Issues"" but never said anything in particular or mentioned the declared emergency as it tends to freak out passengers needlessly as we just fix the part and the plane is good to go.

"The dumpster for our apartment/townhouse complex is just across the street. People are really lazy when they move. They just toss out so much stuff. One time the dumpster was just full of new hard backed books. Fiction, non-fiction, hobby, lots of history. We grabbed as many as we wanted and pulled the rest out and at least set them on the ground so others could easily go through them. Also took a bunch to the library. It really bothered me to see books in the trash. Also a really nice Kitchen Aid stand mixer with a metal bowl and two mixing paddles. It didn't work, but I grabbed it. Those things are $250 in the store! For $20 a local handy man fixed the switch and I have an extra mixer!"

"I've told this one before, but.. 

I was in the market for a new project car, and one of my cousin's college buddies put me in touch with his uncle, who had a whole pile of Sprites and Triumph he was selling. 

Downside? They were five hours away in another state and the over-the-phone descriptions didn't leave me very hopeful. Upside? My cousin offered to share driving duty and gas money to tag along and visit his friend. 

We decided to make a weekend of it; Drive down, stay with the college friend, and spend two days and nights getting drunk and poking at cars. 

The friend didn't warn us about his creepy roommate/landlord though. Normal enough looking guy, but something was totally off. At one point on Friday night I asked the roomie where they kept toilet paper, as the bathroom had none. He stared off into the distance for a good 30 seconds before slowly and deliberately telling me ""They're in.. The closet.. Left side of the hall.. Bottom shelf."" in a monotone voice. 

On Saturday we went to see the cars, and they were a total washout. Most of them didn't have engines anymore, and the runners he did have were so rusty I thought about my last tetanus shot just looking at them. I'd need to haul two shells and a runner back up in a oversized trailer and spend six months just to get one decent car. 

It was a total, disappointing waste of what used to be some nice cars. 

That, combined with the creepy vibe from the roomie and a horrible hangover I didn't want to repeat I badgered my cousin into leaving a day early. He finally agreed if and only if I paid all the gas on the way home. 

On Sunday morning the house we were staying in burned down. No one was in it, thank $deity, but if we had stayed my cousin and I would have been passed out dead drunk in the attic guest room at the time. 

Seems the creepy roommate got it into his head to try some insurance fraud. He did wait until everyone was out of the house in the morning at least, and I don't think he would have lit the place up with us in it, but it was still worth the $10 in extra gas money to be out of there early. "

"Very similar thing happened with me some 23 years ago at an airport lounge in a different country in a different continent.

I bought a cold drink and a bag of chips and settled down with a magazine , as I waited for the boarding announcement. While browsing through the magazine I took a sip and reached out for the chips. Just about then a man occupying the chair next to the vacant chair where I had placed my chips reached for it, tore it open and took one . As I stared at him in indignation he smiled. I took one , sipped once and then looked at him . He smiled again. As I reached out for another  bite he pushed the bag a little towards me as if offering. ""This guy is a piece of art.""I thought . ""How brazenly is he eating my chips and offering me mine own, and smiling too."" This went on. I would sip a drink, take a piece out and eat, he would do like wise . We finished the whole packet. Just about then there was an announcement to another flight , the guy smiled at me, gathered his stuff , got up and walked away.

A little later my flight was announced and as I grabbed  my stuff, I found my own pack of chips mocking me behind my travel bag.

I am sure to this day that gentleman remembers the stranger who took half his chips AND was giving him indignant looks ."

"When I was in high school I taught Sunday School for the younger kids. Like... Kindergarten I think? Younger than 8, I'm pretty sure. But potty trained. 

One day, one of the kids needed to poop. I escorted him to the men's room (not sure who watched the other kids -- it's been a while).

I stood outside his stall, and when he finished he said ""OK, now wipe my butt!""

""Ummm... that's not going to happen. You need to figure this out on your own, kid.""

This led to a 10-minute long argument, during which time I refused to enter the stall and he refused to wipe his own ass. Eventually I'm pretty sure he just hiked them up like ""fuck it, dad will wipe me later"" and came back out to Sunday School.

I talked to his old man after church, and he said I should just come find him in the sanctuary next time. Thankfully, there was no next time."

"**For those interested - From Wikipedia:**

&gt;A rat king is a term for a number of rats whose tails are intertwined and bound together by one of several possible mechanisms, such as entangling material like hair or sticky substances like sap. The number of rats joined together varies from a few to as many as 30. Historically, the phenomenon is particularly associated with Germany, which produced many reported instances. Rat kings occur so rarely that they have sometimes been thought to be cryptozoological creatures, but there are several well-attested modern occurrences. A similar phenomenon happens with other small rodents such as forest mice and squirrels."

"I wasn't on the call itself but was relieving units who needed a break. 

They were dispatched to a home after the father came home to a grizzly scene. Apparently him and his wife were having marital problems. They had 3 kids.  Not sure what the issue was but the next day after a huge argument the husband went to work. 

While at work the wife said ""I'll show him."". She took his loaded shotgun and while the kids were napping shot them one by one. First the toddler. Then the middle child. The oldest woke up.  She consoled him until he fell back asleep and then shot him as well.

Then she left a heartfelt note about how it was all his fault that she did this. She then blew her head off in the foyer for him to find when he got home. 

He came home to losing his entire life. 

That one was one of the most disturbing and vile things I've ever experienced. I've grown to feel numb to almost anything due to this job but that one still makes me sad. I'm not sure what happened afterwards but I believe he killed himself months later. Whi can blame him?

"When you share an office with someone, there's some unwritten rules. You don't fart when the other leaves the room. Surprise, I know it was you. 

But you also don't go to your mutual supervisor and say that you think I'm too stressed out and fear for your safety, when I've done nothing of the sort and am handling my business the same as I ever have. 

You don't complain that I never listen to your suggestions when you literally don't make any, but you do have th is irritating habit of literally turning around and writing emails when we are in the middle of a conversation about work. 

You don't claim that you shouldn't have to listen to anything I have to say because I 'don't do my job', when my team has beaten your revenue by an average of 30% every month for the last two years. 

You don't claim that I'm not doing menial computer tasks that we BOTH know are full of glitches and are never, ever, ever and indicator of business health, especially when you yourself haven't done them on a month, and I literally have an hour set aside every Friday where I do them, and only fell behind because I was on a business trip. 


You don't refuse to hire even though every indicator shows you are 3 understaffed, because you want to inflate your numbers, while allowing your team to under report the hours that they work in an attempt to keep your labor rate down. 


Basically you don't trash talk the other person in a feeble attempt to cover up the fact that you don't run your team, refuse to make hard decisions, put your own leisure time ahead of the (actual) success of your team. And you don't complain about your workload when you are doing 7 hours a day to the guy whose running two remote locations, and you actually have the luxury of seeing all your employees every day.

Another Blue Angel circled the area for several minutes afterward as people started responding. For some reason, after I had learned what had happened, remembering that other jet circling the crash kept coming to my mind. I can't imagine how that would feel, seeing a friend of yours go down like that in what should have been a normal practice run. I really feel sorry for everyone involved and hope the pilot's family finds peace and comfort. Reports are suggesting that the pilot went out of his way to avoid hitting populated areas, which is something to be respected quite a lot.

"Three months after a break up I come across this guy from my uni who is extraordinarily handsome, funny, smart, and really successful both socially and professionally. We talked, there was a first date, a second date, then regular hang outs. I was overjoyed that my love life was again looking good and was sure we would end up dating. We started being intimate really quick, but there was Something off about him. He would ask me a lot of questions about my courses, my internships, where I applied, where my friends did etc. He would also ask ""small"" favours: could you help me with this, that, but to a point that started to seem excessive. 

Two weeks later my roommate asked me if we were dating, I told her that yeah, we went on a couple of dates but I didn't know where it was headed. She told me it was odd because one of her friends went with the same guy on a weekend trip to a vacation house not far, and with two other girls. Apparently a lot of hot hookups with each of the girls took place. She showed me pictures as proof.

I confronted the guy about it he acted surprised and said the pictures were from over a month ago when he was single. But now of course, we were exclusive. We continued dating because I was starting to have feelings and believe him.

My roommate moves out, a new one moves in and put up new posters. One night I hear a guy coming in her room and them laughing and fucking. Next day the guy lets slip up that one of his friends has this and this poster in ""his"" room. I immediately recognise my roommate. I confront him, he acts surprised.

At that time I meet another guy who is far less sketchy. I initially was into him a bit less than the first guy, but eventually settled for him after feeling in my guts that the first guy could not be trusted.

First guy then proceeded to bully me on social networks and tell everybody I was head over heels for him but he wasn't into me. That I stalked him, etc. He even posted on my Facebook wall ""Lol just please stop following me around I don't want to date you you creep me out"". He made up stories about me being a crazy stalker and whatnot.

Turns out the guy was just a genius manipulator. He would charm a lot of girls the way he charmed me, then use them for small favours, hot weekend trips, small loans etc. His social and academic success was mostly due to him outsourcing all assignments to people he knew and using them to get as much information about all opportunities as he could.

I am thankful everyday to my current boyfriend that he came into my life as I was starting to fall for that guy. I cannot believe the heartbreak I would have gone through if this had gone on any longer.

The funniest part? After I stopped seeing the guy in question he constantly made scared faces and pretended to run away when he saw me, in line with the ""crazy stalker"" story. One day I am waiting for an exam in from of a building, and he comes by and makes the same scared face as always. I boil interiorly when  a girl comes out of the building and falls into his arms. I suddenly realize why: he was holding a heart-shaped balloon with ""one year"" written on it. Guy had a girlfriend during all this time.

tl;dr: Almost dated a psychopath. Current boyfriend came into my life at the right moment."

"Movies: 

-In Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry casts the Lumos spell at home, and then gets in trouble in Order of the Phoenix for casting spells at home because *underage wizards aren't allowed to use magic outside of school.*

-This isn't really a plot hole, just dumb writing. In Deathly Hallows, when Harry's talking to dead!Lupin, he says ""And Lupin, your son-"" and Lupin says some deep shit. Teddy (Lupin's son) isn't mentioned anywhere else in the entire movie franchise, so people who haven't read the books would've had no fucking clue about Lupin's son. 

Books: 

-The Horcrux in Harry should've died after he got bitten by the basilisk. JK Rowling says that Fawkes' tears saved the Horcrux, but the writing in the book makes it seem like Harry was dying and not the Horcrux (something about the world going black).

"That's is so close to what happened to my friend, his wife had a recipes blog and was very active on Facebook. Every night, right after dinner, she would sit in front of her computer and write away as usual, no uncommon for her to go to bed at 2am.

As in any other day, her husband, my friend, would go to sleep at 11pm and wake up at 6am to go to work, that evening he wished her goodnight and not to stay up too late. In the morning when he woke up he noticed that she didn't come to bed, went to check on her and found her at her desk ""sleeping"".

She had a brain aneurysm and, judging by her last comment on FB, it seems like she passed away not even an hour after my friend wen to bed.

"On the same note: when they threaten to call the BBB. It's such an empty threat for numerous reasons. The BBB does not take any action, they file complaints. They will not make a company do what the customer wants, and when a customer threatens to call them they obviously have no idea what the BBB does so it's just laughable. And most of the time when they do say they will call BBB it's when an employee is following policy.

The BBB will file a complaint if you're treated poorly because of your race, gender, etc.  They won't take a customer's side just because said customer doesn't like the company's policy. 

The BBB threat was always my favorite in retail. "

Spezi is something my parents never stopped drinking but orange fanta in Germany is not orange fanta. It's carbonated orange juice. To get a similar tasting drink in the states you need coke and a slice of a real orange.

"You can succeed without medication. The medication does not 'cure' you, it isn't like antibiotics who destroy an infection for you. What they do is alter things in your brain to help you recover. SSRIs for example make it so serotonin sticks around longer, and you have more of it, so you will probably find it easier to get things done. But exercise and meditation and healthy eating help for some in that there is more to go around, thus you feel better. The problem really becomes when you feel so low that you cannot will yourself any longer to do anything. Then I'd say you should allow for the help of antidepressants. I think it is good for you that you haven't reached that point yet. But I also want you to know that you don't need to wait for it. Learning to accept help sooner than later is not a sign of failing or being strong, sometimes it is just smart and in your best interests. Which incidentally is something which took me way too long to realize. Stick with what you're doing though, and I hope you will feel better soon enough. But also give it the time needed, and you'll get there. "

"&gt; Everyone thought the world was going to end.

I would say for the majority of people, it was the complete opposite.

We were shutting down military bases all over the country. The Gulf War lasted all of 5 days and we did exactly what Bush 41 said we would: drive Iraq out of Kuwait. Many thought it would not stop there. 

Major nuclear disarmament began, so for awhile it felt like we had turned a corner and that just *maybe* the days of local wars that threatened to become global conflicts was over. "

"I was 18. Fresh out of a relationship and decided to try Tinder for the first time. This was the first girl I ever matched with. We flirted for a few weeks and eventually she invited me over to her place. At this point in my life I had only had sex with one girl and didn't have a whole lot of dating experience so it's safe to say I was pretty nervous. I got there and she was actually way cuter then in her pictures. I was blown away. It went really well at first actually. We chilled in her room and she was creeping my Tumblr, picking out songs and pictures she liked. We had a lot in common. After a while she looks at me kinda puzzled and says ""There is something I want to show you."" She takes me to her closet and pulls out a jewelry box. She proceeds to open this box and present to me the craziest, largest, most diverse collection of **condoms** I had ever seen. I didn't know what to say. Half my brain was thinking *this girl is crazy and probably has tons of STI's* and the other half was thinking *dude your about to lay this hottie*. What came out was the honest truth.. ""That's.. impressive, honestly."" She seemed strangely relieved that I enjoyed her condom collection. She looked me dead in the eyes and said ""Do you wanna fuck?"" I was dumbfounded. We hadn't even made out or held hands or anything but she just got straight to the point. Obviously I said yes and we proceed to pick out a glow in the dark condom and started making out. She strips me down and next thing you know the lights are off and my flying green rocket ship is about to land in some sweet.. slightly crazy pussy. I put it in for maybe half a second and she is howling in pain. I pull out and ask whats wrong. She told me that her last boyfriend had a really small dick and that I am too big for her.. (I am not pumping my own tires, I have a very average penis). She tells me to try again and I thrust maybe 4 times and she pulls me out again. I swear this girl was a virgin and just didn't want to admit it.. but she looked to be in a lot of pain and I felt bad so I told her don't worry about it and we ended up just cuddling and watching Netflix for the rest of the night. Next morning I wake up too what sounded like a B&amp;E. She is already sitting up just staring at her door. I asked her ""What the hell is going on?"" and she tells me that her step dad is home. Poor girl seems petrified. I said ""So?"" and she tells me that her step dad does **NOT** like when she brings guys home. The dude starts **pounding** on her door. Demanding she open it immediately or *be punished later*. At this point I am fucking done. I scramble to start putting on my clothes but I can't find my pants. I hear the stepdad stomp down the hallway and open the garage.. a bunch of rumbling and what sounded like some baseball bats or hockey sticks being knocked over. Not good. She turns to me and says ""Uh oh.. you should probably go.. NOW!"" I asked her if she wanted to come with me but she didn't want to and I wasn't about to get my face beat in for some random Tinder girl so I was eager to escape but I STILL couldn't find my fucking pants!! I decide fuck it. I grabbed a pair of her Lu Lu Lemon leggings off the ground, opened the door and sprinted down that hallway like a half naked Usain Bolt. I could literally hear him chasing behind me. I didn't look back but I swear he chased me halfway down the block. At one point he got gassed and no one was catching me that day. When I was far away enough I turned around and he was smashing a hockey stick against a tree in anger. It was super fucked up. I ended up catching a bus and got a lot of stares from people checking out my Lu Lu's..

Obviously I felt like there was some form of abusive relationship there so I messaged her once basically stating that if she is being abused physically to message me and I will try and get her help otherwise please never message me again. She never replied. 2 years later she drunk dialed me on her birthday saying that she ""loved the time we spent together"" and that she missed me. I told her to have a safe night and blocked her number. I didn't use tinder for a while after that."

"I was brutally honest with my husband when we first started dating about the things I wanted in a relationship. He arched an eyebrow at me at first but appreciated it later.

1. I am dating to get married. That is my end goal. I gave him a limit of 5 (very generous) years to decide if he wanted to marry me or not. I had no intention of dating for a decade plus.

2. I want kids. Non-negotiable. That was a deal breaker for me. If he didn't want them, he had to let me know asap so that I could move on to someone who did. (And of course, ONE TIME during sex I said I'd consider giving up kids for him, and he hasn't let me forget it yet :P)

3. I am a religious person. My faith means a lot to me. I don't give a fuck about swearing, premarital sex etc, but if he mocks my faith, there will be words between us. Being a multi-faith couple can be difficult, so absolutely have this discussion before you get married!!!!!!!!!!!

4. Being with me means putting up with my fucking insane, uber religious family. Because they're my family. I of course will (and do) put up with his fucking insane, Californian hippie (and everything that that entails) family.


I was 22 when we started dating in 2008, he was 27. He was very much anti-marriage, anti-kids when we first met. But he finally proposed after 4.5 years of dating, and many, many, many discussions about kids and what that would mean. I'm now days away from giving birth to our first child, a little girl. And while I never intended to change him or his decisions on things, I do believe that cliche saying of ""if you meet the right person, you'll do pretty much anything to be with them""."

2. Eating is a pleasurable act: Food tastes good, sex feels good. Combine those two base instincts and you get vore."

Anyways the caretaker should leave when the children age around 15 or 16.  This wild humans will have no contact with other humans, and must be isolated in a controlled environment. Then just wait. Willthey breed? How long will this last?

What about their kids kids and so on? Will they develop religion? Language? It's something that would take many generations of study, but would be so worth it. "

My mom hated my brother's first wife. There were plenty of good reasons- she was an addict, a liar, and a cheater, among other things.

My MIL didn't hate me, but she didn't love me either. She resented me and wanted to be the only woman in my husband's life. It was obvious that she would have felt like that about anyone.

I did not like my son's first girlfriend. She seemed very disinterested in everything but her self and her phone. I didn't really know her well or for long, but struggled to see what he liked about her beyond her looks. She was pretty."

"16 yr Realtor here (I know... I know).

Anyhow, I'm always being told how easy it is to be a Realtor.  Here are a few reasons why it is not, all of which I have experienced.

1. 100% commission based.  Try it one day.  No matter how low that weekly pay cheque, at least you got one.
2. Children screaming and wailing at you cause mommy &amp; daddy are divorcing and they know why YOU are selling their home and it MUST be your fault. 
3. Trying to sell homes for families and the owners are in a room in the house somewhere, dying from a terminal disease, so you put a 'please keep out' sign on the bedroom door'.
4. Telling tenants their time is up after 25 yrs cause their home is being sold (always brutal).
5. Working with someone for YEARS (buyers), without getting paid a dime, only to be told they bought without you 'because you were away', 'because you didn't return their call at 11:30pm one night', 'because you didn't work hard enough', 'because Uncle Joe the druggie just got his licence'. 
6. Trying to help 'that lovely young couple' buy a place.  She's bright-eyed, innocent, wants to get pregnant and start a family and he stinks of last night's booze and dope and the LAST thing this dude is gonna' do is buy a place but he hasn't got the guts to tell her... and neither do you.  
7. Your 'open house' is interrupted by a heroin addict coming in the door, naked from the waste down, with a needle jutting from her arm and blood dripping off her fingers onto the hardwood. 911 is called and the signs are down for the day.
8. You FINALLY make a sale and your real estate office, Gov't, car loan, student loan, rent, mortgage, utilities and dealer (oops) grab their share. The only thing left?  ""You assholes make too much money!!!!""
9. If the market is too slow, it's all your fault. If the markets too hot, its all your fault. If it sells too quick, you priced too low, if it sells too slow, you priced too high. If you got multiple offers, you shoulda' got them higher, if no offers come in, 'Uncle Joe the druggie woulda' done a better job"".
10.  Tenants. I've walked in on porn making, free basing, violence, grow ops, illegal immigrants... you name it. And the owner doesn't give a shit, he just wants his money.

"tldr: you don't want to do it - its not worth it.

Trust me there is a reason anyone with a real opiate problem will tell anyone and everyone not to do it. They have the experience to know its 100% NEVER worth it. The withdrawals make it impossible to stop but you want to stop every single day and then your tolerance gets so high that you spend all your money and any money you can get from other people just to stay ""normal"". You'll wake up sick every day and the first and only thing you can do to get better is a hit. It's truly the worst once it gets that far and you can't control whether you get that far or not. Also, vicodin, oxycodone, opana - pain killers like that can and if you have an addictive personality will lead to a heroin addiction once you can't afford the pills anymore.

I'd give almost anything to go back in time and not start down that hole. It was by far the worst decision I've ever made in my life and again, many people with a real problem will say the same thing.

Its weird to hear, but your so lucky just to wake up normal in the morning not addicted to a substance. I envy that.

"A lot of people come in looking for coloured stones instead of diamonds, which is fine. But certain stones are not suitable for engagement rings, because they're incredibly soft and will wear and chip very quickly. The stones I'm often asked about, which I then need to try to steer customers away from, include: peridot, garnet, amethyst, emerald, aquamarine, topaz, tanzanite, citrine, quartz... To name a few.

Instead, I show people sapphires and rubies. Rubies are red or pink, depending on quality and the region they're sourced from. Sapphires come in every colour, so there are plenty of options. And these stones are about a 9 on the hardness scale (diamonds being a 10 - the scale isn't linear though, so there is still a considerable jump between these hardnesses). So sapphires are a safe option, peridots (the first stone that popped into my head in the above example) are not."

And comps. People would abuse food comps all the time. If you get an $100 food comp, the idea is that you take a few people out to the steakhouse. But we'd have people use that $100 to buy us out of side salads and chocolate milk. 

A few people even had the brilliant idea to spend it on deconstructed meals from the kitchen. They'd get 20 plain cheeseburgers to feed their dogs, buns on the side.

Edit:

And you have to compare like things because productivity has made making old things much easier and cheaper.  Adjusted for inflation we could build a model T,  or a 1965 corvette for dirt cheap compared to prices at the time.  Productivity has given us much nicer things at comparatively the same or cheaper prices..  We all win with better cheaper stuff.  Inflation is what is robbing wages not productivity. "

"This is quite easy to answer: 

-When you're in love with someone, it's easy to convince yourself that their terrible actions are a mistake, or they didn't mean to, or it won't happen again, or maybe you deserved it. Essentially, you can justify anything to fit into your ideals. Because really, who wants to think poorly of someone they love? Think of it like this: Someone who smokes in this day and age knows that it is doing them a great deal of harm. From an outsider's perspective, you can think, 'Why don't you stop, it's killing you, it's costing you so much money, why are you doing this??"" But from their perspective, they can justify it by thinking things like, ""You've got to die of something, this makes me happy, I'm allowed to have a vice, I'm not hurting anyone."" Again, justifying something to fit your ideals. It's human nature.

-The time in which a person in an abusive relationship is in the most danger, statistically speaking, is when they leave. They've just pissed off an already dangerous person. So it's not as simple as ""why don't you just leave?"" In order to leave, the victim would need to have a strong support network and a solid plan in order to keep the self out of harm's way. This is hard enough with one person; imagine if there are children involved. More reason to leave, yes, but more risk and more effort as well."

"It's a lifestyle that can be enjoyable for a period for some.

My senior year of high school, I would go through about two full prescriptions of adderall each month. I only ever snorted them once or twice (fuck that nasty tasting nasal drip and having an orange runny nose the next two days) but I do recall one time in a school assembly, I was sitting two rows behind the vice principal in the bleachers when I emptied the beads from a capsule into a strip of paper, folded it up and was crushing it against the front edge of the bleacher seat with my phone. I was doing cocaine at least 2-4 days a week, selling weed to help support that habit, although I rarely smoked it at that point. I drank on the weekends, but got out of touch with a lot of the friends I used to drink with more often in favor of a select few people I'd do cocaine with.  
I was working at Pizza Hut at the time, and most nights at the end of my shift I would make a Stuffed Crust w/ pepperoni and 10 cinnamon sticks, and head off to my dealers house, who'd give me $30 off the blow I was there to get for the grub. I slept through most of the school year, to the point that one guy I was friends with would actually greet me in the morning if he saw me awake with ""was that your last one or can you spare an adderall for a buddy??""

I'd accrued all the credits I needed to graduate except for two senior classes before the school year even began, so my academic responsibilities were no worse than my professional ones. My only bill was car insurance, so financially I had next to no concerns either. I was careful about the people I associated with, and although I did make some dumb decisions about what to bring or not to bring with me where on a few occasions, I never got into any trouble nor in serious jeopardy of doing so.

The bulk of the worst aspects of it all died down pretty quickly over the summer following graduation. Without going to school with kids looking to sell adderall, that whole phase slowed down a lot, and in about June the area I'm in started to face a real shortage of cocaine (which was eventually determined to be the main locus of the rise in murders around the area over the second half of the year), between the hassles of extra searching, higher prices, and lower quality, it was within a month that myself and my couple friend chose to reduce our habit from frequent to sometimes to almost never.

Before we knew it, it was back to mostly drinkin' and smokin' weed (although to this day I still will only smoke 1-2 a year, a lot of friends do regularly) and hangin' out for the most part. Had a lot of fun over that year, and there were definitely some bad days and some downsides, but I wouldn't do it any differently if I could. I'm glad to have experienced all that I did and I'm especially glad that I got it out of the way at the time I did, and was able to grow up quickly afterwards. Almost ten years later there are people I know going through the same phase, some better some worse and some just the same, and while I can't fault them or judge them, I can certainly look at it all and say, ""that looks like a good time, but I'm sure happy I got it out of my system before and at my age now can focus on my job and my family and my less thrilling but less hectic life."

"A pile of shit.  That's right, just a single pile of shit sitting in the hallway.  Story time!

So I live in a rented house with one friend who I've known for almost 8 years.  My room is on one side of the house, and his on the other.  We went out to a friend's place and hung out pretty late there, came back and fell asleep.  I woke up in the morning, went into the living room, and my house mate came out of his bedroom and asked if I shit on the floor.  I was obviously confused, so I went to see what he was talking about.

There it was, sitting right in front of the door to his office: a perfectly formed pile of shit, about the size of an orange.  It was a little crusty, and had obviously been sitting there for a while.  Here are the POSSIBLE explanations we have come up with, and the reason these explanations were rejected:

1) I had a couple beers, and drunkenly shat on the floor.  We reject this explanation because I was tipsy, but I wasn't shit on the floor drunk.  I remember everything that happened that night, and know for a fact that I didn't do it.

2) My housemate shit on the floor as a joke.  Who in their right mind shits on the floor in front of their own door!?  WHAT KIND OF A JOKE IS THAT!?

3) An animal shit on the floor.  We checked every room and every closet and there were no animals.  All the windows were shut, the doors were all shut, and we don't have any pets in the house.

4) A ghost shit on the floor.  This is the most plausible explanation currently."

"Even at 23 and just starting to get my feet wet in politics, I can appreciate how difficult it is to effect any kind of change. But given that it's a country of 300 million people who all have different ideas of what should be changed, of course it's hard. People talk about voting for president like it's an act of revolution when that's merely a starting point given the 100 Senate seats, 435 House seats, 50 governorships, and thousands of seats in the various state legislatures out there.

I do get the impression that people don't necessarily appreciate what kind of impact they can have on a local level--nor do they appreciate how local politics can feed into national politics. That said, I also get that it takes a lot of spare time and energy to really have that kind of impact on (or even knowledge of) local issues, and not everybody's going to have that in their 30s. Or even their 20s."

"I have a three-way tie:  

1) I used to work at a farmer's market along a highway. One day I hear a car slam on its brakes; I look up at the sound, and the motorcycle behind this car runs right into its rear. And the motorcyclist flew through the air for what felt like an eternity--at least 20 feet--and then slid on the pavement for another 10 feet. We read in the paper a week later that he'd *survived*.  

2) One night my wife and I were driving home from a concert, and a big box truck in front of us decided to take an exit very suddenly. They'd tried to take the turn too late and hit the exact point of a Jersey wall triangle, going something like 75 mph. I watched the man explode through his windshield and land on the highway in front of his truck. It felt like slow motion as I fluidly changed lanes to breeze past his corpse. I called 911, then kept driving home.  

3) I went to a bullfight in Madrid in the mid-2000s. I'm a big Hemingway fan and had been reading *For Whom The Bell Tolls* in the weeks prior to my attendance. I'll admit, I found the art of the fights as beautiful as he did. But they were *violent*. I went with a crowd of young people from the hostel I was staying at, and I'll never forget what happened after the first fight: This Japanese girl I was sitting next to turned to me and said, ""I've never seen anything die before."""

"The city went really cheap with repaving roads after a levy passed to generate a lot of money for cause. We have the worse potholes I've ever seen, I'm talking over a foot deep in a lot of places. So people said enough and wanted it done right and proper. After the levy passes and the roads were paved a couple years later they were falling apart worse than before. Some roads crumbling along the edges off into ditches. It was bad. 

People were outraged and demanded to know why the roads are worse off after raising a bunch of money to get it fixed right. It's leaked to the local paper that city went cheap and used some kind of formula that wasn't suppose to last long because of there's one thing that people will pay taxes for its filling potholes. Problem is, they drastically underestimated what they were doing and the formula used failed faster than expected. 

Obviously people were pissed but the worst part is we had to extend the levy to pay for it to get done right again. So far there haven't been any issues. "

Our wedding photographer however was something special she got some amazing action shots, she made tubby me look like a GQ model at times, pictures of inanimate objects were also just gorgeous, wife is already beautiful but the way she captured it just wow. The way she directed our wedding ""photoshoot"" was just incredible compared to the standard, ""look at each other"", ""stand in a line"", situation.

"Can confirm.

$Cstmr = I was at the Genius Bar a week ago and one of you guys — maybe it was you, I don't know, you all fucking wear beards — reset something on my phone, and now my display is covered in these bright dots!

$Me = Okay, looking at the notes, it appears we reset your network settings, becau—

$Cstmr = Yeah, that caused me a load of trouble. I had to fucking call up Comcast because you erased my Wi-Fi password!

$Me = Well, it does seem like we did go over what would or wouldn't be erased with that reset. I'm assuming the issue was resolved you were able to connect to your home Wi-Fi again?

$Cstmr = Yeah! No thanks to you! And you ruined my display! What kind of incompetent twats does Apple hire? You call yourselves Geniuses, but I beg to differ.

$Me = Not a Genius, just a mobile technician. Geniuses work with Macs. In any event, I strongly suspect the light spots you describe are due to liquid damage. Would you mind if I bring the phone to the back for a quick inspection?

$Cstmr = Oh, and what are you going to do with it? I demand that you do this here in front of me, so I know you aren't stealing my information.

$Me = Firstly, we don't have anything to protect against ESD damage here.

$Cstmr = What's ES—

$Me = You don't need to worry about that. The point is, if we're not grounded when we're doing this, we might further damage your phone. You're not authorized to go in the back, so that's one point. Second, it appears you do have a passcode on your phone, and given I don't know it, I don't have the means to access your phone.

$Cstmr = Fine, whatever! Just do it, but you'd better be quick.

*Three minutes later.*

$Me = Well, it appears there is indeed liquid damage. The liqu—

$Cstmr = WHAT DO YOU MEAN!? I NEVER DROPPED THIS IN WATER!

$Me = It doesn't have to be submerged. It did come in contact with liquid. I can't speculate on how or why it happened — I wasn't there to see it happen. I can only tell you what I found. So, every liquid contact indicator is strongly tripped, some components are beginning to get corroded, there are obvious liquid stains throughout the device, and there are a few spots of standing liquid still remaining. So, there was water inside it at some point.

$Cstmr = So what does this mean?

$Me = Well, we can replace your phone. As this is accidental damage, and it does not appear you have AppleCare+, the cost to replace this device is going to be $269 plus tax.

*Customer procedes to blow up and froth incoherently, demand a manager, blow up at the manager, be offered a discount to shut them up, blow up some more and demand a free phone in a retail box with all accessories included, be denied and be reminded of the offer of a discounted swap, and then storm out proclaiming that they will never buy an Apple product again as long as they live.*

"It was 9AM. I remember this specifically because that's when this old moron called. I'm going to call my friend Frank for the sake of this story, who happened to be a manager in the call center.

""I want to speak to Frank, NOW!""

""Sorry sir, but Frank doesn't get in until 9:30AM. If you like, I can either send you to his voicemail, take a message for you, or connect you to another manager?""

""...Did you not hear what I said? I WANT TO TALK TO FRANK **NOW.**""

""? I heard you sir, but Frank isn't here. His shift starts at 9:30AM.""

""**I WANT TO TALK TO FRANK.**""

For 15 minutes, I'm going through this cycle with this yelling dumb fuck and we finally get to this point:

""Now you listen to *me.* You make sure that before Frank has his first cup of coffee this morning, you give him *my* message! **YOU MAKE SURE FRANK CALLS ME IMMEDIATELY.**""

""Ok, sure.""

""NO, **LISTEN** TO ME. If Frank doesn't call me within the next 20 minutes, I'm going to my local McDonald's and shooting EVERYONE up and blaming **YOUR** company for it!!!""

Wouldn't you know, Frank decided to come in just a few minutes early and he happened to be walking by my desk as soon as this was said, he stopped when he heard me say:

""Sir, **SIR**, we're on a recorded line, I really wouldn't joke about murder-""

""**YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW SERIOUS I'M BEING**""

""...ok~""

""**MAKE SURE FRANK CALLS ME**"" and he slams the phone down. Frank asks me whats up and I tell him.

Within 15 minutes, the old fuck's local PD are at his house and bring him down to the police station. From what I'm told from the cops, he was irate as fuck all the way to the cop station and when they got him in the interrogation room, he was yelling about how he was going to sue the town, sue the police department, sue the cops who took him, sue my company, and sue *me* personally.

Then they played the recorded call for him. He reportedly broke out into hysterical childish tears and begged for forgiveness and how he didn't mean it. I don't remember specifically what happened legally to him, but he was ordered to remove his assets from my company and I was never supposed to talk to him again.

He got me on the phone 2 weeks later.

He was much more meek and I think he actually recognized me because he made it a point to tell *me personally* that he appreciates my service and all. I showed no emotion and moved on.

Fuck that old dude."

"Posted this somewhere else but figured it might be useful here too. I'd recommend taking a listen to the **Thank Me Later** and **Take Care** (pre-2011 era) again. Specifically, some of the less played tracks from the Take Care years, like [Over My Dead Body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTNg6UNnusY), [Club Paradise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfGOqrXcm_Y), [Underground Kings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUXzdeYnPTc), [Up All Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ShkxTf5utw), and the not so underplayed [Headlines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cimoNqiulUE). 

What he somehow lost over these past few years (something he'll probably never have again, since hip-hop/rap seem to be moving towards minimalism and experimentation) and in my opinion what makes him amazing is the production. By itself, his voice and vocals are what they are, some people like them and some people hate them. But for me, part of what makes his music great is 40 Shebib's &amp; Co's production in his tracks and the overall vibes his music manages to convey. It's like the modern day equivalent of the era of romanticism and idealism in poetry, the Wordsworth/Keats-esque journey into the world of neon lit dark LA clubs and 2 AM cloudy Toronto skylines, somehow being and feeling forlorn in a world that just handed fame to you on a silver plate. 

How the synths just melt gracefully into the atmosphere in Headlines, and how the Weeknd backs the vocals in Club Paradise (When he says ""*They don't know you*"", you can almost feel the actual solitude in the air). How the beat manages to convey the undertones of the unknown but upcoming hustlers putting in the grind, the Underground Kings. The grandiose over the top quality of the flow and vocals in Up All Night. Drake's number one appeal, of course, was stadium-sized hooks (again, something which he seems to have lost after Take Care). If you've ever heard [I'm On One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z09lYqdxqzo) or [Miss Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRLSQDCkcaA), you can see what initially drove him to success: his ability to draw in the listener with lines that just inspire some amazing confidence in you."

"The point about why pedophilia isn't comparable to a sexual orientation is that pedophilia intrinsically involves lack of consent, since children--who are not sexual beings in the way that pedophiles think they are, or in the way other consenting, mature people are--**cannot consent to sexual activity** any more than a dog can; it's coercion, tantamount to rape. Other sexual orientations, like homosexuality, do not *intrinsically* have a component of non-consent. An awful parallel that should be dropped. 

The other point is the claim that ""gays can't help it, and it's okay for them; pedos can't help it, so it's okay for them, too!"" implies that if gay people *could control their sexual orientation* (which is controversial whether sexual orientation is completely nature and not nurture), *then they could be liable to be blamed for what they do.* 

By many people's lights, even if sexual orientation were a matter of choice entirely, then gay sexual relations wouldn't be any more blameworthy if otherwise. "

Not that it isn't okay to get a meaningless tattoo that you just think is cool - people can get whatever tattoos they want - but the meaning behind the tattoo is another layer and another reason why people should hesitate to mock or sneer at popular tattoos."

"Not at all. I'm a manager of a department with 82 employees, and the goal is to motivate everyone to reach a common goal.

But motivation works different for everybody - some are motivated by freedom to work independent, others through regular praise in front of the team, others need a silent clap on the back, some want recognition through additional tasks transferred to them (e.g. working in a small project group on a new product/process), again others are motivated best through financial incentives.

It is my job as a manager to identity those individual triggers and use them to achieve our department's goal.

But sometimes, some people just need a kick in the butt, for their own sake or to not demotivate others through going unpunished. That's also part of my job."

Edit: Thank you all for the well wishes! I recently finished a treatment and the doctor told me it went well! The original diagnosis was actually given by the pathologist(I think...) after taking a biopsy sample. They wrote on their report ""undifferentiated"", which was the cause for alarm. After having a specialist looking at my samples before, during, and after surgery, he determined it to be an easier to deal with cancer, but a harder one in that category(sorry if that doesn't make sense)."

Edit: I'd like to add that initially this post wasn't serious I mainly posted it as a joke. Realistically though, I don't advocate such a thing as an initial response or somewhere along those lines. I know how much that time dedication feels for gamers and little kids. Hours building a town, castle, etc; hours leveling up your Final Fantasy characters and getting their ultimate weapons and such, all shit like that so I understand the shear heartbreak of seeing it all vanish. This would only me one of my last resorts if my kid did something bad and continuously did it and other sort of punishment was not getting through to him. u/FourFingerLifeHug I get where you're coming from, but that's a very shitty way of parenting a child. Over something such as that, so small and insignificant on top of that. You're basically discouraging him from trying to express himself in any way and he'll eventually (if he hasn't already have) build the mindset of ""What's the point? Its not gonna stay there anyway."" Sure, it's digital and it may seem like it's nothing through your eyes but expressing yourself comes in various different ways: music, poetry, sports, etc. and if one of those gateways shatters the kid's motivation his chances of turning to a different form of expression is very very slim. 
Edit 2: guys please stop attacking the user I mentioned above. Although many of you may not agree with what he does, he's explained himself pretty well down below. Just read it and shut up. Any more responses from you to him will basically be one of his old responses reworded towards you. He's said all there is to say. I myself can't fully agree to his approach after reading it all. He gave full warning and he was deliberately disobeyed. So in that sense I sort of do agree. I was raised that way by my old man so I get where he's coming from in that department. Just like my old man told me: ""if you dont like my, or anyone else's way of parenting then don't do it when you have a family of your own and see how that works out."" "

"They're raising the point that the man might have killed his family over something that didn't even happen, which is worse than if it did happen, though only slightly."
"I worked in people's homes helping with their disabled kiddos. 

All the houses were a bit messy and chaotic, but not unsafe or dirty. But I had one family with a severely disabled toddler who always had poo and pee on her. Her mom didn't brush her hair because ""she won't let me."" I would tell her, you're the mom, you are in charge. But she was very ignorant and lazy and unable to keep up with grooming housecleaning. She watched other children for her family, so the other kids would always wreck the house and bring in rocks from the outside, which my tiny client would put in her mouth. So we made a goal for the mom to ""remove small objects"" from the floor and tracked her compliance.

The house had roaches, the carpet was filthy. If the toddler ran out of diapers, she would let her run around without one. So she would pee on the carpet/furniture and her mom would just wipe it with a paper towel. I would leave when that happened because I could not run sessions with no diaper on the kid. I brought my own blanket from home to run floor time sessions with the kid. I asked my boss if I could wear scrubs so I could change after, but she said no. I asked to be switched to another case and my director said that working in utter filth was part of the job.

Once, the toddler grabbed my head and was giggling. I was used to her and didn't think anything of it. But the rest of the day, I kept smelling poo. By the end of the day, I realized the smell was coming from me. I took my hair down and the smell intensified. I took a hot shower and washed my hair.

The next evening, I was stricken with E. coli and had to go to the hospital. I had to miss a few days of work because I was so ill. My company fired me for taking too many sick days, which is bullshit because I had reported how gross the house was and I spent so much time in preschools. It makes you sick a lot! And we were forbidden to come to work if we were contagious to avoid infecting other clients.

They tried to block my unemployment, so I appealed and explained how I had reported the problem and received no support. I included a quote from my director in which she said I should find another job if I couldn't handle sitting in pee and cockroaches every day. I won my appeal.

We did report them to CPS, not for the mess, but for a possible molestation incident with the creepy dad and his niece. When I left, the mom was pregnant again. 

I've seen some *shit* in my day, but that house stuck with me and I still worry about those kids :(

"My mums family was extremely poor, she lived with 5 siblings and a plethora of cousins, all living off her mums sewing business, while her dad dealt with a alcohol problem, which worsened after he had an undiagnosed stroke at the age of 39. They had no prospect of getting any money, life was just about making do. My mum hates talking about it, but I knew it was bad. I saw the ""house"" they grew up in. It was an eye-opener. At one point, some of her older brothers and cousins had to sleep *under* the house when it got tight. 

When she grew up, she went on a full scholarship and moved to India (from Fiji) and did medicine and became a doctor. Now, she's well off, she makes a lot of money, and is very comfortable with life. 

She doesn't have any classic tell tale signs of coming from poverty, she doesn't try and save money, she doesn't actively help those who came from where she came from. Rather, the one tell tale sign, to me, that she had a very poor background is that she never says no to me or my brother. Whenever we asked for anything, toys, food, money, anything, literally anything, she never says no. I think her thinking behind it is that her mum always said no to her because she had no choice, and now she doesn't want to do the same because she can give us what she always wanted. 

We didn't turn out spoilt or anything, maybe we were a little chubby, but we were happy, and that's what my mum wanted. She says she was happy when she grew up, in a different way, but this is what she wanted and she worked had and she made us so happy. "

"Worked in a factory that made metal storage cabinets.    
Was in the welding bay with another worker, both decided to go for a quick smoke break.    
As we walked off, about 20 sheets of metal fell from racking about 15ft high just behind where the other worker had been, landing where he was previously.    
Very very lucky he moved when he did as would have been seriously injured at best

Also, at same place, I worked on the paint line where the cabinets were hung on an overhead conveyor by 5mm wide 12-inch long hooks.    
The cabinets go through a oven to dry the paint, so sometimes the hooks stick a little.    
Went to take one off, slightly stuck so yanked it a bit, cabinet came down, hook swung straight towards my face so I done the obvious reaction of closing my eyes and stepping back.    
Luckily, this saved my eyes.   
Unluckily, the hook caught in on of my nostrils and caused a tear of skin the whole way up my nose and took a small chunk of flesh with it.    
I didn't even know it had happened, just though it had pulled at my nose until the guy next to me was stood in shock staring at me as blood was pouring down my face.....   
Luckily was taken straight to A&amp;E a mile away, stitched up and all is well as can be.....

"Throughout most of my teen years I was suicidal, though I only tried once. My parents were abusive and had convinced me that I was worthless, that everyone hated me, and that I would never succeed in life. I was constantly afraid because my mother would burst into my room at random times (sometimes in the middle of the night) and dump all of my dresser drawers, search through my belongings, and pull me out of bed by my hair. I didn't see the point of being alive when it consisted mostly of fear, and the understanding that I could never be worthy of love.

I changed my mind when I moved out of my parents' house and life got infinitely better. That was 18 years ago and my life is wonderful. I do still have a lot of nightmares about my childhood, but I love my life.

I think most people who are in a horrible situation, usually can't see beyond it, because it takes all of your energy to deal with the present. It seems so silly now to think that I didn't realize that life would get better and that I could get away from my parents, but I think many people find themselves feeling hopeless and not believing that a solution exists."

Not very effective in Australia?
"A newish employee stopped coming to work. He lived alone as his family was overseas waiting for visas to be finalised.

He did not show up to work for a few days so his manager went to the house we were renting for him, no answer to the door or phone and he could not see through the windows. We decided to get a set of keys from the company managing the house which took a few days.

The manager entered the house to a horrendous smell (middle of an Aussie summer) and found the guy in the bed room with blood absolutely everywhere, the carpet had a massive pool of blood and he was laying on the bed which was soaked through. He was clutching a towel to the back of his head. The manager had a quick look through the house and found a heap of blood in the bathroom and some so it appeared the guy had slipped and hit his head, grabbed a towel to stop the bleeding and then bled to death on the bed.

Odd thing is, the guy was generally a neat person with good work standards and the house was a mess with doors open and stuff all over the floor. The police did not seem concerned by this and the coroner passed a verdict of accidental death. It was left for us to organise cleaning the house up, when the same manager was packing up his personal stuff he found a frying pan in the lounge with a big dent on the side and a piece of flesh and hair stuck in the dented bit....police did not think this odd and did not investigate.

I really thought the plane was going down, the sound of the engines is burned into my head because I swear they got louder than I've ever heard an engine get before (pilot went full throttle perhaps?)

Anyway, the plane levels out and we went along with our flight. No one says anything. I'm sitting in first class when I hear the stewardess open the cockpit door (pre 911) and say something I couldn't understand, then I hear what I'm pretty sure was the pilot yelling ""another god damned plane, fucking private""

"Big prog-rock/metal, alt-rock dump here.

**Scenes From a Memory - Dream Theater:** The greatest in prog, seriously. Every song on here is fantastic, a lot of fans' favorite album.

**Affinity - Haken:** Haken has been powering up to be the new prog force in the scene since it seems Dream Theater has been slipping since Portnoy left (in my opinion). Affinity is an amazing prog album that goes a little retro back to the roots of the 80's, while keeping some new flavor in there with songs like The Endless Knot.

**Good Apollo I'm Burning Star IV Volume One: From Fear Through The Eyes of Madness - Coheed and Cambria:** I just love Coheed, that's all I have to say about that. My favorite band and albums hand down. 

**Act IV: Rebirth in Reprise - The Dear Hunter:** My second favorite band, a fantastic band that is similar to Coheed in a lot of ways, but more progressive in their writing.

**Arrows &amp; Anchors - Fair to Midland:** Severely underrated band, but probably because they broke up after the release of this album. The songs feel like you're in a fairy tale or a dream almost, while keeping a nice rock/metal vibe.

**Maps of Non-Existent Places - Thank You Scientist:** The biggest band Claudio (of Coheed) has signed to his Evil Ink Records. These guys are a powerhouse. Seven members and some of the best songs I've heard to date. They're releasing an album July 29th, the song ""Automatic Blue"" is out to listen to.

**The Odyssey - Symphony X:** - This is where I got my writing style from (in terms of music). Fantastic musicians all around, and Russell Allen is bae. The Odyssey (and Divine Wings of Tragedy from their other album) will probably be one of the songs I request to listen to before I die.

**Pink Lemonade - Closure in Moscow:** - So much flavor and personality in this band. Just give it a listen. They're like a modern Mars Volta.

**Dreamhouse - Tides of Man:** A solid rock album thats a step above the rest; a lot of personality because Tilian is such a fantastic singer and writer. He did leave to join Dance Gavin Dance though.

**Resurrection - Galneryus:** The only speed metal band I can listen to anymore, out of Japan. Really great musicians all around, they take the speed metal and put a lot more prog into it, which is what I like. 

**Thrill of the Arts - Vulfpeck:** Jk, not all I listen to is prog and stuff. God I love Vulfpeck. So much funk and flavor and personality. Joe Dart is a sick bassist, and Antwaun Stanley gives me goosebumps when he sings. Just listen to Christmas in L.A., Beastly, Back Pocket......blah just listen to everything."
"I always feel kind of awkward when receiving a blowjob.  My partner ends up doing all the work while I just sit there holding her head in one hand and a rubber ducky in the other.

The really, really sad part of all this is that girl was probably routinely raped and molested for her to get pregnant at her age. Really upsetting to learn of stuff like this."

He came around one night and started.  You KNOW straight away where this is heading once you've experienced it.  He was advancing on me, literally snarling.  We were in my kitchen and I just turned around, grabbed the bread knife and went at him with it saying ""You want a fight, you've got a fight"".  He literally ran out of the room and held the adjoining door closed with all his might.  When the dust died down he said that he'd looked at me, thought ""will she do it?"".  ""Yes"".  And he ran.

Sadly, I did go back with him one more time but he never gave me a beating again.  In the end I chucked him for sleeping with my ""friends"".  Nobody EVER laid a finger on me again though."

My highschool math class has apparently been taught that calculators don't follow PEMDAS, and that ""they are only as smart as the person holding it""

They do. I have no idea where this misconception started, but it is stupid and frustrates me so much. If someone can prove me wrong, please do

Edit: I would like to add some clarification to my original comment, and add some things others have said. My class uses TI-83s, which do use PEMDAS/BODMAS. However, my class says that calculators in general don't do so, so my apologies for not clarifying

My own statement, ironically enough, is my own misconception. Simple calculators (only do basic functions such as +,-,/, and *), as /u/iron_dinges has pointed out, perform calculations in the order that you input them

Apparently, some calculators use something called postfix notation, as stated by /u/Thinks_Too_Logically below, and is also referred to as Reversed Polish Notation, as stated by /u/Myrl-chan. To quote /u/Thinks_Too_Logically:
&gt;some calculators use postfix notation which has no operator precedence. So ""3 + 3 * 2"" is ""3 3 2 * +"" while ""(3 + 3) * 2"" is ""3 3 + 2 *"".

Also, /u/Hitlerclone_3 commented a link to a Minute Physics [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=y9h1oqv21Vs&amp;autoplay=1) which goes a little indepth into PEMDAS if anyone is interested 

Thanks to everyone who has pointed out the errors with my own misconception!"

"I just gradually stopped being suicidal. 

I had lost a lot of things due to being suicidal. My friends and getting kicked out of college for not going to classes were the big ones. After that I didn't do much. I just laid in bed all day.

I would just lay there watching YouTube videos all day. I didn't really have the energy to play any games myself so I mostly just watched Let's Plays.

By the time summer arrived I was feeling a lot better. I went out more. I didn't have anywhere to be or anyone to meet so why not? It was nice just being able to walk around town in the sun without a care in the world.

By the end of summer I was feeling so happy that I decided to try and get my life back on track. Maybe get a part time job or a new hobby?

I remembered how much watching Let's  Plays during my depression and how much they helped me. So I decided to look into that. I thought maybe I could do the same for someone else going through depression.

I had some money saved so I decided to buy a new PC and some recordings equipment. And started a channel in September and made my first video in October 

7 months and 150 videos later and I'm more happy than I have ever been in my entire life.


EDIT: Since a lot of people are asking for a link to the channel, I'm gonna have to leave a link here because there are too many people to PM: www.youtube.com/c/ZombieNEETparade

My Ex had messaged me throughout the show asking why I hadn't said, hi, etc etc. It gradually got more aggresive until she explained, ""Dusty wears, Magnums"". (Dusty is the guy she went with).

A few weeks later she said I should get STD test because Dusty apparently had herpes. (Apparently he doesn't always wear magnums).

A few weeks later she continued to email, me asking if she could get some ""sweet sweet"" (that was our nickname for me being balls deep, in her.)"

"In particular, I think the ""It's Dat Boi"" type of meme, where its not a reference to anything being used in a new context but is instead literally the same thing reiterated in very slightly different way, will be the most despised. Like, the reaction images/macros (most commonly done from twitter screenshots) will be seen as something similar to demotivational pictures (i.e. completely forgotten and done in a slightly different format) but are at least somewhat relatable across time. 

The first type of meme reminds me vaguely of ""Kilroy was here."" But when you you have flavor-of-the-week memes done rapid fire (again, ""dat boi"", mr. skeltal, fish memes, and I'd argue spongegar* might count) before the bandwagon moves on, then it's just like human-generated spam.

*EDIT: I've heard that Spongegar should proparly be named Cavebob Spongeman (both from /u/Tostificer and elsewhere).

"My older sister was taken by her father when she was 6 weeks old to a different state and dissappeared. When he was arrested a little less than a year after that he told police that he had let his gf take her and had broken up with her a while back and didn't know where she was. All the while my entire family had been searching for her, missing child reports filed etc. They looked for her for another year without any leads on finding her. Meanwhile my mom starting dating a man that would become my father. He was a dumpster diver. While staying in a hotel with her out of state following up on a lead on my sister, he dug though the dumpster after something interesting he saw. It was some children's toys.(my mom also has a son a year older than my older sister)  When he ripped open the bag of toys, he found an envelope. A birthday card adressed to the ex girlfriend of my sister's  father, it was for my sister, sent from the ex girlfriends mother. She had turned 2 a few months back. They found my missing sister by going to the adress on the envelope. A missing child was found because my daddy is a dirty old dumpster diver. :)

"1st grade. In the 1970's in Highland Mills, NY. We had these little squares of carpet we as a class would sit on the floor with during circle time, story time, etc. The carpet squares came in many different colors, but there was only one carpet square that was green. This was the most sought after carpet square as a result. Much conflict (as any one with kids will tell you) ensued over this single carpet square. I never wanted it. Why? Too much trouble. Even back then I was a take the least path of resistance kind of guy, so I *never* took the green square. Never. One day we had circle time at the end of the day. After circle time, we had to put our carpet squares back and sit at our desks to wait to be dismissed. Well, there was a single carpet square not put away. The green one. So our teacher, Mrs. Sherman, said that we were not going to be dismissed until the person who had that square put it away. No one moved. She repeated the ultimatum. People were getting antsy, buses to catch you know.  No one moved. She repeated her statement again. A kid named Gary got up, picked up the square and carried it back. Mrs. Sherman thanked him, and asked why he did not put it away. Gary said ""I didn't take it. Barton_Foley did,"" and shot me a shitty look. So Mrs. Sherman gives me the death stare and the rest of the class started in, ""Yeah Barton_Foley took it and did not put it away!""  Keep in mind I never took that moldy piece of fought over crap green carpet square. Never. Didn't that day either. But Gary pointed the finger of judgement at me and the rest of the class piled on (pretty sure it was actually a window licker named Robert who took the green square). Whole class turned on me and the rest of the week I was ostracized, had a conference involving my parents and the teacher over my ""behavior"" and despite my protestations, no one believed me about the green carpet square. So, eff you Gary you snitching SOB, the least you could have done was point the finger at the right guy, you asswipe. "

The day it hit the shelves, I walked into Office Depot the minute they opened, walked directly to a huge XP display 15ft inside the door, picked up a copy of Home, immediately turned around and set it on the counter at a register. The girl--who had seen me walk in &amp; pick up a copy--looks at me and says, ""Did you find everything okay?"" I was confused, because I'd been in the building for 6 seconds, and had made a bee line to the display and then to her register. ""Uh... yeah?"" ""Great!"" Then she rang it up and told me to have a nice day. Anyway, I went home and installed it, and it forever changed my life. "

"I was seeing this guy for about three months. We were just getting into serious couple stuff when he decided it was too much effort and broke it off. 


I was a bit sad, but whatever, plough on. Anyway 24 hours later he realises he's made a huge mistake and wants to get back together. I catch a bus to the station, and a bus from there to his house. We have sex, and then I left. I make it back to the bus stop in time to catch the bus directly after the one that dropped me off (they were probably hourly), and made it home before anyone even noticed I was gone. When he started telling everyone we had gotten back together I acted all surprised like I didn't know. "

"It was during a fight between 'his side and mine', basically, in a larger situation that 'almost' became a war but still had lots of deaths. Described as 'attempted genocide' by some, not mentioned in western newspapers, and very quickly forgotten. Won't say the country, before you ask. 

I mostly just remember thinking about how my dad would come home each night and tell me about the things 'the other side' did, like burning people alive, killing children, chopping up the wounded. There'd just been a big fight in another district, with a couple of thousand people on either side fighting, with hundreds of wounded and dozens of dead.


To cut a long story short, there was a skirmish near our house. 'our side' 'won.' I had a guy who'd I'd been fighting with (He had a club, and I had a blade) on the ground (not very glamorous, he'd tripped over his own legs and I gave him a shove and a gash on the thigh) and almost ran him through on instinct. Stopped myself because I realized how absurd factionalism is, and how hate can't keep something going forever, even though I hated him in that moment. The closest example to what made me stop is I recall some fictional war where one person says something along the lines of ""Our's, theirs. They're just lads. Only difference is they wear another color.""

Glad I didn't kill him. The...let's call it 'ethnic-border-fuckup' ended soon after, and both 'factions' seemed to let it drop. Stupid thing to die for. Especially for him (the other guy) For a politician's regional vote in neighboring country. Makes the fact that there were people who did die all the worse."

"Oooooh I have a good one. In 1957 a Finnish architect, Eero Saarinen, was sitting on a panel deciding on the design for the Sydney Opera House... except he was a day late. Eero took it upon himself to look at the entries rejected by the panel the day before and decided he liked the design submitted by Jørn Utzon so much, he convinced the rest of the panelists to change their minds about it. This design became the Sydney Opera House we know today.

Next year, in Toronto, Eero would sit on another panel, this time to decide on the design of Toronto's new city hall. As is his wont, Eero showed up late, and again, he decided to go sifting through the trash. He found a design he felt was better than the others, and repeating history for the second time, was able to convince the rest of the judges of this, too. The design, by Viljo Revell, was built a couple of years later.

Eero also designed the St. Louis arch. This guy was basically a truffle sniffing pig for monumental architecture."

Clinical Chemistry

&gt;

H-hCG is hyperglycosylated hCG, eg, hCG with carbohydrates stuck to it. Glucose is a carbohydrate. So if H-hCG is the principal source of reactivity, then maybe glucose could cause a false positive?

That's about as far as I can get without knowing the actual enzymes and indicators that are used, which is a lot harder to google. 

Someone should see if sugar water also gets a false positive. Also try using vinegar, and tap water to see if the pH is the cause.

"Ignorance. People are often proud of what they don't know, and will say derisive  things like ""I've never even heard of that mega pop star"", or ""I haven't played a video game since Mario Man"".  It's fine not to enjoy these things, but it's not a badge of honor to proclaim your ignorance of them.

Edit: I'd like to clarify that I personally am quite ignorant regarding pop culture. The point I'm trying to make is the importance of accepting that this (or any other area) is an area you are ignorant in with humility and an open mind, as opposed to wearing that ignorance as a point of pride. We are all ignorant in a very great many and varied areas, but that's nothing to be proud of- instead it is an area of opportunity for each of us."

This means they are exempt from overtime even if they are below the minimum threshold  (recently bumped to about 48k).  I suspect that doctors and dentists don't have to worry about falling below 48k, but it's insane that teachers are exempt from overtime rules.

Edit for context:  federal government in the us sets a minus wage for which overtime must be paid regardless of whether you are paid salary or hourly.  This was recently raised to 48k.  However certain types of professions are exempt.  Do you make widgets on a salary of 40k and work 50 hours a week?  You'll now be eligible for overtime.  Are you a teacher on a salary of 40k and work 50 hrs per week?  You're out of luck."

"I don't like ABBA rhymeschemes unless you're doing a petrarchan sonnet. It's a change from what you normally do, I suppose, but you need a good rhythm for it to work. The rhythm in this feels rather unpronounced, as a lot of it is monosyllabic. Unless you're trying to keep it monosyllabic to highlight even the power of smaller words, I'd suggest switching some larger ones in.

Line three is definitely worth poking a bit. It doesn't feel like a natural construction, so the rhyme feels forced. The second stanza works a lot better than the first, actually, and it's possible this line might be why.

An overall verdict is that you could probably do with more sound-based techniques in this particular poem. The power of words in poetry is in both form and meaning, and I think you've got the meaning bit covered for now."

"The U.K. Is part of the European Union. It is hard to explain exactly what it is but I will just say it is a framework built for European countries to cooperate on a large amount of issues. The main purpose is ""The Common Market"". This allows EU countries to trade with one another's more easily and means that Europe has one market of half a billion people. This makes Europe attractive to investors overseas and brings in money to the continent. Over time the EU has evolved into a closer union with a parliament a council and a president. These create laws the member countries have to follow (though there is a process of negotiating opt outs). There is also the concept of free movement of people. This allows people from an EU country to live, work and study in any other EU country without a visa. 

The U.K. Has been one of the most euro sceptic countries in Europe since the beginning. We constantly negotiate opt outs etc. Which means we have certain restrictions in place. 

Now the eurosceptics have started to gain mainstream political power in the UK and to appease eurosceptics in his own party the Prime Minister has put a vote of UK membership in the EU to a referendum. 

Vote Leave argue that the membership fees we pay to the EU are not worth it, they argue the EU is undemocratic and often they focus on immigration wanting to ""take back control of our borders"" as net immigration is at 300k people a year according to the latest figures. 

Vote remain argue that being a part of the common market is worth billions to the uk and therefore the fees are worth it. They argue and many leave campaigners now acknowledge that leaving will lead to a recession (possibly lasting years) and therefore leaving is not worth the risk. They also argue that the EU is more democratic than vote leave would have you believe but concede it isn't perfect and that we should both remain and REFORM the EU.

The vote is to take place on the 23rd of June (this month). Most polls are predicting remain will win but if turnout is low enough the leave may have it.

"I made a dashingly handsome Sim named Johnathan Pleasant. Mr. Pleasant was a Virgo, he was intelligent, he was an avid reader, and an all-round lovable fellow. But Mr. Pleasant had a secret… 

*He craved the tender meat of newborn babies.* 

Mr. Pleasant attracted the attention of a wealthy young neighbor lady, who, after several minutes of flirtation and playful tickling, realized she was madly in love with him. Ten minutes of canoodling later, and they were happily engaged with a baby on the way. Mr. Pleasant bided his time, watching his wife’s belly grow with a yearning hunger. A few days later, Mrs. Pleasant birthed not one, but *two* healthy, plump twins (male and female). Mr. Pleasant no longer needed his wife, so I made her wander into the attic and sealed it off. 

Mr. Pleasant was overjoyed! His hungry eyes fell upon the two babies on the floor where Mrs. Pleasant lovingly left them before disappearing into the attic. He cracked a wicked smile, for he had an idea. 

He cradled the young girl in his arms as he took her to the barbecue he recently bought just for this occasion. He placed her on the grill, sealed the lid, and turned the knob to the highest setting. 
He invited Mrs. Pleasant’s family over for dinner that evening. They enjoyed the lavish meal and commended his culinary skills, unaware that they were eating their niece/grandchild. 

Mr. Pleasant decided to groom his male heir so that he would maintain the Pleasant legacy. Together, they lured and impregnated unsuspecting females, only to starve them to death in their impromptu Murder Attic whilst they dined on their babies. 

TL;DR I made a family of wealthy, baby-eating psychopaths.

"There may be more than one method, but this is the one I'm familiar with:

They tell you to run Windows Event viewer, and then they say ""do you see error X?"" X is a very common, harmless error, but most people don't know that.  They claim that this error is an indication that you have a virus.

Then they ask you to use Command prompt to bring up your system information, part of this information is a number.  They will tell you what this number is, thereby confirming that they know which computer is yours.  Except that that number is the same on all Windows computers.

Finally, they tell you to download/buy some software to get rid of the problem.  If you're lucky, all you've done is wasted money on software that doesn't do anything except show a fake display of the nonexistent viruses getting deleted.

I said, ""Me too!""

He said, ""No.  I mean, I used to watch it when it was actually on, not just re-runs.""

I said, ""That's not really something to brag about, old man.""

"Ah, the bystander effect. It's scary to witness. 

One night my boyfriend and I were walking to our bus stop in the city. (We're in Australia.) In the distance I saw a woman and man talking. Eventually the man dragged this woman into an alley. 

My boyfriend thought the two were playing around, but I suspected something might be wrong. I ran into the alley; my boyfriend followed; and the woman was clearly whimpering and pressed against the wall. '*You're hurting me, please stop, let me go...*'

We began yelling at this guy. The guy mentioned '*It's ok, she's my girlfriend.*' We told him it's *not ok*. He keeps hurting her. She becomes louder. We ask bystanders to help us find a police officer. Every person would look at where we were pointing, and continue walking. Eventually my boyfriend and I separate - he's calling the police while monitoring the situation, and I'm on foot to find any police nearby.

After 10 minutes *one* other person (a tall strong girl) decides to help by threatening the guy. He leaves; the strong girl leaves; the guy returns; and we're back to finding the police again.

Eventually my boyfriend was able to direct police to the situation. 

Overall, it was unsettling. So many people walked by, saw what was happening, and didn't even make a phone call. If we could have at least 10 people on foot, we could have found help sooner. It's not like we said '*help'*; we were giving out specific instructions. ('*Find police.*') I hope the people who kept walking don't find themselves in the same situation as the woman did. :/

Note: This happened last year."

"It was my son. I tried to hang myself (belt plus door) and was nearly successful. I couldn't breathe and I was relieved. I was so happy and I was blacking out. 

Then, the strongest, brightest image of my son burned the forefront of my mind. It was so strange, but so strong. 

I pulled myself up. I was so sick that I thought I was doing my son a favor by not having to grow up with someone like me.

That was over two years ago. He's five and cuddled up on my legs, watching cartoons right now. I've been in therapy for about three years and I have made really good progress.

I'm still depressed. I still have issues. Sometimes, I still want to die. However, my son is always going to have me around. I will never give up.

There is going to be a day, hopefully soon in the future, where I'll be living for myself. I look forward to it. :)

"A couple of my favorites:

The TMNT were created as a parody of the gritty comics of the 80s, and since they were parodying it already they ripped off the origin of a recently popular hero-Daredevil. The whole crux of the turtles' origin is ""what if the canister that blinded Matt Murdock bounced off instead?"" They have other similarities too: TMNT have their splinter to DD's Stick and the Foot to his Hand.

Judge Dredd had a crossover with the Jolly Green Giant. They did a parody of the big guy when Judge Dredd and some people made a journey across the Cursed Earth and it made the JGG's parent company mad, so 2000AD made a followup strip where they explain the guy they ran into wasn't the reall JGG, then the real giant visits them while they sleep and leaves canned food for them.

Well I pulled up the order and looked at the Tracking info which came up and said ""Delivered. Left at front desk"" with the front desk attendant's signature. For all 3 orders. She's demanding for us to send her a new one, to which I replied ""Go down to the front desk and ask the receptionist if anything has been left for you. It was delivered. All three of your orders.""

"Karl Marx

His original idea for Communism was that it would be a natural evolution to Capitalism in the same way that Capitalism was a natural evolution from Feudalism.

Feudalism is a shitty government system, he said, but it would solve society's ""food"" problem. With an excess of food, more traders would emerge and economies would slowly grow to become focused around goods and services more than wheat and physical protection.

Capitalism is a good government system he said. Marx worried, however, that it would be prone to corruption and a number of other problems which I can't remember the specifics of. Eventually, capitalism would reach an optimal peak where goods could be produced so cheaply and in such great quantities that there would be a functionally infinite supply. Upon reaching a post-scarcity economy in which robots produce whatever goods we could wish for, ONLY THEN would Communism be a valid form of governance.

And instead, Marx's image and ideas were used by a country that wasn't even really done with the Feudal era to try to skip Capitalism entirely, and then another country used the same ideas with the intent of regressing from an early-capitalistic economy back to late-feudalism in order to differentiate itself from its capitalistic occupiers."

I headed over to Video World and reviewed a bunch of DVDs to rent. It was one of those nights where nothing was in. I saw a movie named ""Laurel Canon"", it was an independent film with Christain Bale. It had good reviews. I knew his parents were into music and art so I got it.



Everything is going fine until (spoiler alert) the fiance of Christian Bale's character starts having a lesbian affair with his mother. I started feeling pretty cringy. We all continued to watch in silence and ended the night pleasantly but I was a bit embarrassed.



Fortunately we have had many non-cringful times since then but I don't recommend a romance film between a guy, his girlfriend, and his mother for your first movie night with possible future in-laws.

I'll take a wild guess at what happened...
"me.  

i was 'that kid.'

i had a pretty serious tragedy in my family early into high school that sent me into a deep depression.  i stopped going to school entirely and spent most of my time shoplifting books and then reading those shoplifted books under my bed.  i also did a very lot of drugs.  just a hugely very lot.

i barely slept, i barely ate, i barely spoke.  i spent all my time deteriorating physically and mentally.

my parents were pretty worried about me and i was seeing a psychiatrist at the time, so the decision was made to have me briefly placed in a mental health facility called Hillside, where I spent the next nine weeks very heavily medicated until it could be determined that i was not a threat to myself.   
i spent the next couple months pulling myself back together and finally, about two years after the tragedy in question happened, returned to high school.

i was generally pretty unpopular even before this all happened - i was a 'weird' kid and i'd done a lot of silly shit for attention.  my classmates knew exactly two things about me:   

1) i'd suffered a major loss in my family,  
2) i'd spent over two months in a mental health facility.  

i came back to two years' worth of insane rumors.  

*apparently*, i had gone batshit crazy and killed both of my parents with a hammer.  after a wild manhunt (that somehow escaped the attention of all news outlets), it took six policemen to hold me down (which is amazing, i was and am pretty fucking skinny) and i'd bit one of their ears off and barked at them like a wild dog.  
they had to keep me tranquilized for the trial (which also somehow never made the news) and i had spent most of the last year in a rubber room.  oh and all my teeth were fake because i ruined them all trying to chew my way out.  
i was released because not guilty by reason of insanity but i could flip my shit and kill everyone at any moment, because that is obviously how 'not guilty by reason of insanity' works.  

(all of this completely ignored that both of my parents are still quite alive 23 years later)

(there were other stories about what had happened to me but that one is by far my favorite, because it makes me sound kinda badass, which i am decidedly not.)

that first year back was hell for me.  the tougher kids would try to show how cool they were by taunting and attacking 'that psycho kid' - and because i was 'that psycho kid' i'd get ganged up on a lot, if i ever tried to defend myself i'd get dogpiled.  

most everyone else avoided me like i was made of plague.

i mostly coped with drugs, sadly.

i don't do any of that shit anymore, but yeah.  drugs.

it was a pretty bad time.  i don't remember much between 16 and 20 (so many drugs) and i did a lot of stupid shit (because drugs) but i eventually discovered acting and writing and i finally made some real friends (who didn't do so much drugs which gave me a reason to do less drugs because i was doing these drugs alone but now i wasn't quite so alone) and somewhere in my early 20s i managed to kick all the drugs (i'm now in my late-30s and i don't even smoke anymore).

things are better now.

a year or so back i was invited to my high school's reunion.  

i laughed so fucking hard because no fuck you

**edit:** hey listen, i really, truly do appreciate those of you congratulating me on 'recovering' from depression but you really should know, depression isn't something you recover from.   
it's something you cope with.  the shit that happened to me happened to me.  there's no statute of limitations past which it just magically goes away and everything is suddenly gumdrops and rainbows.  
every day is a struggle not to backslide into self-destructive habits, ranging from just not being able to get out of bed to literal self-destruction.  

(addiction is much the same - you don't ever fully recover from addiction.  the temptation is always always always there - it'd be so easy, so easy and it feels so fucking good you can almost forget the shitheap you turned your life into.)

things are better now - i have friends, a loving and infinitely supportive wife, two cats i love so much it makes me cry and a good job.  i don't act anymore but i still write.  things are better but there's not really a 'recovery' process here, i struggle with this shit every fucking day.

"not op, but its more of an ""if."" no (sane) gun owner is hoping for a home invasion, but many of us feel a little safer having the option. I personally dread the idea of having to defend myself, but i'd rather be able to than hope that i wont have to.

That being said, shooting guns is fun. That's my biggest argument for 2nd amendment. Some of us hunt, some of us do competitions, others just like putting a few boxes of rounds downrange on a Saturday afternoon. I, personally, understand that some restrictions should be in place, background checks, denying firearm ownership to felons, and special licenses for ""high risk"" firearms (fully automatics and the such), just to prevent them from getting in the hands of dangerous people, but i dont feel that they should be denied from civilian use without reason.

"Seems like this is one of those days to reminisce about the crazy and cleanse it from my system so here goes. 

He was always a little of the rails but unfortunately I am sorta into that and always have been. I just thought he was ""interesting"" but I was only 16 then and he was a few years older. I looked up to him.

When his only real parent died he snapped and that was that. It was all downhill to Crazytown from there. At first he got extremely into the bible. So much so and in such a warped way that he started hitting me if I accidentally cursed. The day he found out I was pregnant I cursed by mistake and he beat the crap out of me, really hurt me, for the first time.

Eventually things got a lot worse. There were a million rules I had to follow everyday to avoid beatings. Rules about food and clothing (no mixed materials) and personal/cleaning products. He thought ""chemicals"" caused all these insane problems, and if I used a chemical by mistake I would get beaten badly. He thought spirits spoke to him and that God was showing him signs through random things such as the time on the clock or words/numbers here and there.

I became a total shell of my former self. He isolated me from everyone and everything. I was so brainwashed and confused. After our daughter was born he thought that my Prolactin production was causing him to have physical problems that made him more effeminate and also mental problems. So I started getting beaten and berated for breastfeeding or even sitting in the wrong chair or place. 

I was covered in bruises head to toe constantly. My head was so sore and full of lumps It hurt to lay it on my pillow every night. Everything that had ever been a part of my identity was taken away. I used to write, but I had to stop because the things I wrote about were stupid, I couldn't listen to my old music, I couldn't dress how I used to. I couldn't even have plastic baby toys for my daughter. Our house was basically empty because everything was unacceptable, and filthy because he wouldn't allow me to clean with anything but baking soda and vinegar ( not even dishwashing liquid).

He didn't have a job for years, he thought he was above every single job. We were so broke. It was like living in hell.

Eventually I left somehow to live on my own. We were still ""together"" because it is very hard to break the control someone like that can have over you. He came to live with me a year later and stayed for another year and a half, the entire time he had another family in another town ( they had a baby together) and he tortured me with this other girl. He compared me to her constantly, and she gave me no end of trouble. 

He almost killed me several times during that time. I was just waiting for death. Waiting for it to be over with.

I started talking to a boy I knew from highschool while he was on one of his trips to visit his other family, and he reminded me of everything that I used to be. It snapped me out of it a great deal. I put my foot down, I finally told my ex he could not come back to my house. I lived in fear for a long time but I moved across the country with that boy from highschool.

We're engaged now and have a daughter. It has taken years but I finally feel like my old self again. I couldn't be happier than I am now and it all seems surreal, like it was a long nightmare.

TLDR; literally psycho ex had a secret family in another town, was basically a cult leader level religious crazy, and almost murdered me several times.  "

Small amounts of fluoride = good, high amounts of fluoride = bad.

Dental and skeletal fluorosis aren't so great for you. We've really only seen strong evidence of this in certain areas, like rural China though, where fluoride levels in water are *incredibly* high.

One of the (legitimate) issues with fluoridation of water is that some places don't check natural fluoride levels before adding fluoride. So you might end up needlessly doubling your fluoride dose, and then brushing with fluoridated toothpaste adds a bit more, and then a bit more from other crap like fluoride treatments, and you end up with dental fluorosis.

Enough = good  
Too much = bad"

"This is something I didn't even think about as a first timer.  My wife has a few so she filled me in.  I was getting the logo for a charity (we raise money for Children's Miracle Network, and I told my donors that if I broke $5,000 on the year I'd get a tattoo of the logo--I raised $8,000) on my arm, but I had to figure out how to give the artist some license.  I brought it to him--it's a gaming controller with wings and a halo since it's a gaming related charity--and he asked if he could take some license with the wings.  Instead of a boring silhouette of wings, he went all out with a lot of detail and color I didn't expect, basically full angel's wings with beautiful yellow/gold coloring and shading.  I was blown away and so glad I went to him at the end of the day.  After attending a conference, a couple of other people had similar tattoos for similar reasons (I don't mind sharing this one with people since it's for an amazing cause--anything to help sick and injured children), but mine blew everyone away.  

TL;DR:  Even if you think you know exactly what you want, give the concept to your artist and ask them their opinion or to take some license with it.  They're artists after all, not skin ink printers.  Let them do their job."

"That is partially true, but it took a long time for a heliocentric universe to become the dominant paradigm in western thought, well after Copernicus described them. People built theories with earth-centric planetary orbits with multiple tangental orbit attached to them (which got pretty extravagant) to account for the apparent wobble in their orbits and maintain the concept of the earth-centered universe, which in the church was still dogmatically held as being indicative of us being the apples of God's eye. Even Copernicus himself presented the theory as a mathematical curiosity for fear of losing his patronage. 

Dante believed that the Earth was the center of the universe; the innovation that he helped propagate was that the planets had orbits around the earth that were independent of the sphere of fixed stars.

So, while the idea of a heliocentric universe had been introduced long before Copernicus conceived of it, he made substantial improvements on the Ptolemaic model and his theories are responsible in a large parts for making that idea the dominant scientific paradigm.

-Works in a shitty job, is late and gets reprimanded for it

I would cover shifts, stay late, finish big projects, and work ALL holidays. Instead, what does she do? She hires the open management spot to someone who quit a few months prior for a ""better job."" That person was also fired 4 months after taking the job I wanted for constantly showing up late to open the store on time. 

After she was fired, I was sure I would finally get my opportunity - my boss promised me we'd talk about it if a spot came open. I show up to work, only to be met by my new manager. My boss didn't bother to talk to me about it one bit. This was my ""Fuck it, I'm done.""

"Some years back I worked at a bookstore that was a chain, but with only one store in each of the 7 cities it was in. The closest one was about 250 miles away.

One Tuesday morning, a woman walked in at 10 AM (we opened at 9) and said she wanted to return a hardcover book that her daughter had bought as a present for her that she didn't want. She claimed her daughter had bought it at another one of our stores. I looked at the book and it was a very popular title that had literally gone on sale that day. 

Now sometimes books have an official release date but its OK if you start selling them earlier because it's a book no one ever heard about. But this was a going to be a huge bestseller, so the street date was strict. If you got caught selling the book early, the publisher would come down hard on you, so no one would be dumb enough to sell it early.

Anyway, I pointed out to this woman that the book had literally come out that day. She didn't think this was a big deal, just said her daughter had bought it somewhere else. I asked if she was sure that it had bought at another of our stores and she said yes. I pointed to her left where we had bookmarks with all of our stores' information and showed her that the closest store was 250 miles away so what she said was impossible.

Even though she was caught in her own lie, she double-downed and said not only had it been sold a previous day, but her daughter had Fedexed it to her. 

Too bad for her, we had access to all of our other stores sales in real time. I called up the ISBN for this book, turned my computer screen towards her and showed her that not only had no other store sold a copy of the book before today, since our store was one time zone ahead of all the other stores none of the other stores were even open yet and hadn't sold a copy yet.

She asked to speak to a manager. Not wanting to waste my actual manager's time, I told her I was the GM. She asked for the owner's information and I gave her his email and phone number and told her to have a nice day. She walked out, pissed, with her (probably stolen from a Barnes &amp; Noble or Borders) book."

"When I was in high school, there was this one teacher who was maybe 70 years old.  He was a fixture at the school, was one of the first teachers there when the school opened in the late 60's and had been teaching there for easily 30+ years.  When I started there, he had actually ""retired"" several years earlier but was basically the school's resident substitute teacher so was often there.

I remember in grade 9 we had a school assembly/discussion about people leaving class and either taking too long to come back or not coming back at all.  Some of the teachers were saying that it was disrespectful to them and that it had to stop.  If students were going to leave, they had to come back within 5 minutes (because any longer was rude?).  Eventually, this 70 year old teacher stands up and says that it's bullshit.  The other teachers were making a mountain out of a mole hill.  But more importantly, he said that as an 70 year old man, he felt it would be extremely inappropriate for him to limit teenage girls' use of the bathroom.  Better to risk them skipping class than for him to stop a girl from dealing with her period.  That shut the whole thing down right quick.

He was, even after 30+ years of teaching, one of the most well respected teachers that school ever had."

"While working at a call center I would cold call people just to verify their information, and update their account if needed from the Marlboro/Camel bucks/points account they had previously set up. The following week someone else would call them again and promote Phillip Morris and ask them about the specific tobacco products that they use. 

The sad thing is more than half of the people I was calling were dead and their spouses or children were the one's answering the phone. Every one of them was angry, screaming, and blamed me (thinking I was Phillip Morris) for killing their loved one because they had died of cancer thanks to the tobacco company. Lung cancer was the most common theme I heard. I just worked for a call center that multiple businesses hired to collect data or sale/promote something and not specifically Phillip Morris. 

I took my concern to my manager because I didn't have the permission to delete the account and I didn't want those poor people bothered again. I can't stress enough how many accounts were like this. He told me that it was Philip Morris policy that we (cold callers) couldn't delete accounts and that we had to make 2 attempts (cold call and warm call) no matter what, in order to contact the account holder. Their was no option to do anything but update account info as a cold caller. First we did a cold call and a week later a different team with a warm call. No matter what! I hated that job so much I decided to quite after sitting back down and hearing the same story again from a distraught person crying on the other end of the phone. I decided at that moment I was going to quit. Out of curiosity I asked a guy who did warm calls in the adjacent room that had 20 or so more callers if there was any circumstance that would keep them from having to warm call accounts. He said no, but he also said that if the caller was not the account holder or was not at that number they were required to end the call, not explain anything to the other person, and delete the account from our database. 

So the next 3 days became my last three days and when my computer would call the Marlboro/Camel bucks/points accounts I would hang up before they had a chance to answer and then update the file with all sorts of ridiculous names from Elvis Presley to Optimus Prime. I ran through the data base so fast those last 3 days I probably did 2000+ accounts.

 I'm not sure what it was like the following weeks when those accounts were forwarded to the follow up team but I would've like to have heard them asking if Mr. Miyagi, Buzz Light-year, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jack Mehoff, Harry Balzack etc... was available. I went through so many accounts that I couldn't think of another actor or fictional character by the end of the first day. Now if the follow up team called a number and it wasn't valid or the name didn't check out they would discard the account and move on. I hoped it saved some of those people on the other end the pain of having to rehash the loss of their loved one again.

That's also what gave me the extra will power to quit smoking."

"This is the beginning of my 2 years in Brooklyn.  I was 25, and am female.

Dude was an older guy, and very heavy. As I said, I woke up and discovered him after realizing my week old tube of toothpaste was gone, as was the other two tubes belonging to the remaining to the other roommates.

I continue down the hall, and he's on the futon.  It was an older piece of furniture, and it breaks a few days later while he's with us. At the moment, I'm kind of stunned ans freaked out that there's a man I don't know on the couch who reeks, and claims he's living with us for a month. I just nod, leave as quickly as I can, and text both roommates ""what the FUCK!?""

Female Roommate (FR) explains that she ran into him the previous everything, and she didn't think to ask or notify us of his staying. Male Roommate (MR) and myself both tersely tell her that yes, of course everyone needs to be told ahead of time if a guest is extensively staying over, and to ask permission of the other roommates first, since we are sharing a living space.  FR apologizes and assure it won't happen again (it does. 3 times.)

I come home and he's hanging out on the futon, watching me as I discover all of my Chinese leftovers were eaten.  At this point in my life, I have a $12/hr job, trying to sustain myself.  The Chinese was supposed to sustain me another 3 days.  He apologizes and said he was hungry. I say it's ok, but please don't do it again.  I explain I can barely afford rent, my car insurance, gas, and food for myself without having to feed someone else, and manage to scrape enough change together to buy and can of ravioli and a can of soda from the corner store. 

At some point it's explained to FR and HF (Homeless Friend) that he can only stay a month, because our paranoid land lady (who had once already randomly dropped by and let herself into the apartment when I was napping) will kick everyone put if she catches him.  For me, his presence may make me just as homeless, because I don't have the money to live elsewhere. 

For the next few days, every time HF sees anyone, he begs for money for booze, the subway, for food, for entertainment. I explain to him once, under no uncertain terms, that I can't pay all of my bills because I don't have the money. I can't feed an adult.  I've already been crying to both previous that I have no savings and I'm barely hanging on, and having a random dude hound me for money is stressful. Sooo after the second household meeting, he stops asking, and we all quietly learn to shop for the day and to leave no leftovers.  I also lock my room when I'm gone, and keep my toothpaste in my room.

Unfortunately, he took that as a sign that anything left outside our bedrooms are his, so our towels are mysteriously scented like him, and toiletries are missing. Whatever, I have other towels. Sometime at the end of the first week, MR and I learn that HF has two children who refuse to take him in, even knowing he's living with strangers for a month, because he refuses to help himself. Oh...goody.

And then stuff in the living room goes missing. MR no longer allows HF to use his laptop (there was the belief he was selling things of ours).  We can't have guests over because of the smells that now permeates the apartment, and HF makes everyone uncomfortable. Sometime in the second week, he breaks the futon that belongs to MR and many creepy comments were made by HF where I beg MR to back me up in having him leave. This being 5 years in the past, I only remember that I was especially upset by them. The food thing was in the past for me - I was selling prints that were helping me out enough so I could buy more than ravioli and soda daily. 

Anyways, MR was more than happy to be the one to tell HF he had to leave. I don't remember how it went down, because I was at my second job, but I do know that when MR and I returned home that evening, the entire apartment was...well, I'll put it this way:

None of us could afford the electric spike an AC would cause. So it's 2012. Brooklyn. June. The door to the apartment was locked, but walking up to the third floor, there was a unique...smell.  He and I were worried. It wasn't like rot, but we were vaguely worried about finding a body. We rushed up the stairs, him first, and we opened the door to be assaulted with a wall of stench. Imagine open garbage in the middle of a heat emergency in Brooklyn.  The windows were shut, and there was no one there. No FR (at the moment) and HF was gone for once. The smell came from the garbage cans, and when MR opened one, we dry heaved, and I ran around the living room to open the windows. No note, but we knew this was his (temporary) goodbye to us.  It takes about 3 days of Febreezing and using candles to get the apartment to smell normal.

That night MR and I discovere there was the emergency situation where he was angry at us, gone, and with all of FR'S keys. If we tell the landlady, we have to replace everyone's keys in the building. FR begs us to not tell her, and we give the ultimatum that she gets her keys back within 2 days. 

Somehow he got to Boston and took her keys out of anger. I don't know how he got there, or how she got her keys back, but that is how my second or third month had ended with the unexpected guest. "

"Totally off the top of my head, since I married a Norwegian-American.

The Norwegians have their origins as a multi-ethnic nation, since there's blonde-haired, blue-eyed Norwegians (similar background as Swedes and Danes) in the south and Sami or ""Laplanders"" in the north. Historically, there were lots of kings of Denmark and Norway, or Sweden and Norway, or Denmark and Sweden and Norway, etc. Norway was rarely governed under an independent sovereign before the modern era.

Norway wrote an independent constitution and rustled up its own sovereign sometime in the 19th century on 17 de Mai. That's when they formally separated from Sweden. I want to say their first independent king was named Carl? I think the next king (current crown prince) will be Hakkon 8? The Norwegian people democratically elect a parliament, called a Storting or Roting (is that a kind of pen?), I seriously can't remember. Wait! I just remembered that they had their constitutional bicentennial like 2 years ago. So maybe they got independence in 1814?

Also in the 19th century, there were some attempts to distinguish Norwegian (Norsk) as its own language. Scholars tried to synthesize a more ""traditional"" form of Norwegian (more like what was found on the West Coast, near Bergen) and ironically called it New-Norwegian (Nienorsk?). So Norway technically has two official languages, New-Norwegian and Bokmal, the thing that most Norwegians actually speak. So I think most Norwegian passports say both ""Norge"" and ""Noreg,"" bizarrely.

Uh... what else? The Norwegian people are generally very reserved, but they know how to boogie on the-day-of-the-midnight-sun (midnatsol?). They actually drink pretty heavily, in spite of a liquor monopoly (vinmonopolet). They sell lightly alcoholic apple cider in stores. They also have some relatively serious sin-taxes on sugar, so some people cross the border to Sweden to buy cheaper candy and soda. Norwegians are also pretty cavalier about certain risks to bodily injury. Kids will climb around rocks as if they're mountain goats. Most Norwegians who I've met are missing a tip of a finger or have a nasty scar of some variety.

Um... much of the Norwegian economy is being subsidized by their national oil monopoly. I think it's called Norskoil? That's mostly routed into a sovereign wealth fund with a view towards the long-term economy. They're trying to avoid being the Saudi Arabia of the north.

Oslo is relatively boring, a lot like Minneapolis, but Bergen is really pretty albeit rainy.

Norwegians will try to get you to eat some stinky cheeses (gjetos?), but they don't eat as much ludefisk as their American cousins. A lot of Norwegian food is very bland, and a middle-Norwegian family doesn't really get how spices work. They love their brown cheese, though, and rightfully so.

Norwegians are somewhat skeptical about Europe as a political project. Norwegians don't like German tourists who RV around the country and fish up the beautiful Norwegian fjords without contributing anything in return. But they do appreciate cheap Polish labor. Poles are like Norway's Mexicans, but with better legal protections.

Norway's weather isn't nearly as cold as Americans believe it to be. The most inhabited parts of Norway have weather that's more like English weather: rainy and a bit cold, but not frequent piles of snow like Denver or face-freezing temps like northern Minnesota.

The Norwegians are really friendly, but super shy! We should all become friends with Norwegians so that we can take advantage of their awkwardness with impugnity!"
"Hey Reddit! Been getting more and more into this site and I really like it! Anyway, I figured I would post mine since I was actually the crazy ex (or I became it)

My first girlfriend (and romantic relationship) happened when I was in my late 20's. Finally, it seemed, after years of dates, no replies, and rejection it seemed like the trend was finally broken!

She was a work colleague of mine and, despite my friends and family members warning to NOT DATE SOMEONE AT WORK I did not abide since I was so taken and surprised someone would be interested in me, I thought she was one of the most beautiful women I have met in body and mind. She was dorky, energetic, and seemed to be very mature especially considering my absolutely awful performances in the bedroom mainly regarding duration during intercourse - which did get better with time and experience. 

We dated for a year and I finally felt such strong feelings for her. I remember waking up next to her and just smiling so much feeling like I found someone who could inspire me and I could look up to and rely on. However, after a year a new guy started working in our company. He was a bicyclist, cross-fit, and pretty attractive guy (even by my notice). A bit after he joined I noticed she became more and more distant. We then got into a fight over her not wanting to go spend a weekend at my aunt's island and then she hit me with the ""can we talk"" text soon after. Her delivery was quick and efficient. She said all the nice things: ""I am not ready for a long term relationship"", ""You are amazing"", ""I need to focus on me and my career now"", etc.

I was so sad I was actually surprised. I thought we made up over the trip issue, but then BAM this happened. I didn't know what to do, I sat at my computer dumbfounded looking at Cheezeburger cat pics trying to make sense of it. My mind was numb. At first, I thought she was genuine and we could just be friends - NOPE!

Within a week of dumping me, she was at lunch with the other guy, he was going over to her desk, and after a month they were leaving the office together.

I cannot describe how much that hurts. I tried to get transferred, I tried to find another job, I tried to work from another location to no avail. And for 8 months straight I watch them together. In the halls, in the cafeteria, in the company gym. The all time worst part was that she would look at me like I was some kind of monster. She saw me with such un-ending fear and disgust in her eyes it drove me a bit crazy. 

And crazy I did become. I started experimenting with steroids, weight gainer powder, heavy workouts &amp; power lifting, boxing, and self harm (punching, belt whipping, and low level cutting). Eventually the roids, supplements, and lifting bore fruit and I went from 6'6'' 195 (88 kg) to 295 lb (133 kg). However, as many know, roids and supplements spike testosterone which can spike anger easily. And when you have someone who is in a crippling depression getting their heart broken every day for days, weeks, and months - they lose it. I lost it.

I freaked out one night - Valentine's day of all damn days - and drank a liter of Vodka and began yelling/screaming at everything. My best friend and roommate was terrified. Eventually I couldn't take it. I took some Tylenol to thin the blood and walked into the bathroom with a knife and cut open my left arm. I bled out for a bit and - unbeknownst to me - my roommate did call the cops when he realized I was in the bathroom a bit too long and was silent - even the crying stopped. The EMTs arrived and stabilized me. After that it was a hard few months of rehab at a psych ward and a lot of anti-depressents, anti-psychotics, and sleep aids. 

Once I got out and returned to work. She was still there - dumped the guy a bit after word got out I was in the hospital. And she began to see how big and utterly monstrous I became (still worked out even in rehab but sans the roids and supplements). I did not look at her with smiles and happiness anymore, there was only utter hatred and anger in my eyes. I honestly have never really recovered. She tried on multiple occasions to get me fired and poison the office against me. However, finally, I got another job and left the company I had been with for 6 years. 

TL;DR - My ex left me for someone else, dated them in front of me. I took roids &amp; got massive and then tried to kill myself. Then became somewhat of an office monster that made everyone a bit uncomfortable - her most of all in the hallways.

"It's interesting, because, growing up as a white kid, we had jokes for numerous ethnic groups(including Pollacks, which was something that I didn't understand meant someone from Poland) that we told on the play-ground, often times in the presence of members of that group.

I admit it was probably not fun for any kids unfortunate to belong to the group being parodied, but it was usually meant as a way to poke fun at some of our differences. 

Don't misunderstand, as a guy with a small penis, I realize that ""all in good fun"" is much more offensive to the ones being mocked or mimicked, and I certainly don't condone this sort of joking from my own children. I just think that what we classify as ""hate"" in our current culture is more likely ignorance.

"One of my best friends in high school was this girl who lived two houses over. We were both 16. She was a rebellious type of girl. She almost died of a drug overdose a year before this incident and she was kind of a slut, for examples. I think the reason she was like that was that her parents were SUPER strict and her dad was terrifying.

I came over to her house because we had plans to go to watch a band at a club. Her brother lets me in and as we sit in the living room he tells me my friend is having it out with her parents. Suddenly I hear screaming and yelling and she comes storming down stairs. She yelled at me that we were leaving even though her parents were telling her she wasn't. This was awkward enough. I headed for the door but before I get out of the living room she screams at her parents something like, ""FUCK YOU BOTH, I'M GOING AND YOU CAN'T DO SHIT TO STOP ME AND WE'RE GOING TO GET FUCKED UP AND I'M GOING TO FUCK {MY NAME} AND SUCK HIS COCK! WANT ME TO DO IT RIGHT HERE SO YOU CAN WATCH?"" When she said this I looked at her dad and he looked at me as if he would kill me. And then I drove us away.

We did go out that night. And she did get fucked up. But we didn't do anything sexual (that night) despite her efforts. Her dad scared the shit out of me. And then the next day she told her parents what had transpired and they all made up and her dad came over and thanked me for taking care of his lunatic daughter.

She was actually a really awesome person and I loved her for it. She was a fantastic mother to her kids when we grew up. She was one of my best friends and she died of an infection in her late 30s."

I had something similar once with a popular girl asking me out in high school, and it instantly set off a whole China of red flags, even if no-one else was around at the time; mostly because we'd never even talked previously and she was suddenly jumping immediately into asking for a date.

I can only imagine that either she was dared to, and didn't want to do it publicly, or she *somehow* had decided out of the blue that I was eligible and was just incredibly terrible at working up to it. (And still didn't want to ask publicly in case things went wrong.)

One highschool had a dress code against ""belly shirts"" that they took to the fullest extent, so a bunch of girls&amp;guys wore shirts that were just short enough till the rules got refined to specify half shirts or shorter.

My school had a rule that guys had to wear pants. So no shorts, kilts, skirts, etc. So I wore a skirt to school everyday for a couple of months till the superattendant over rode the rule. (After all girls could wear micro skirts and tube tops as long as they wore leggings.)

Then the last one I don't remember what happened, but you were not allowed to anything ""shear or potentially see through."" I recall a lot of girls protesting wearing white shirts in the rain.

I think school dress codes are constantly getting contested, due to some back job teacher or principal forgetting the ""intent of the rule"" over the ""letter of the rule.""

"I agree with you in principle but in practice it doesn't always work out very well. I have 7k in my bank account. I've been saving up so I can go to school where I will have no income for a while. A friend asked to borrow 3k to pay a deposit on an apartment (he's get 4 kids, needs a big place). I told him I couldn't part with that, because I won't have income for a while. He's like ""Oh so you have it, you just won't give it to me.""

"So when I was a kid we had a trampoline, which meant we always had friends over playing on it.  One night my mom left to take a friend home.  My brother and I were like 10 and 12 at the time, old enough, so we stayed outside playing when she left.  We lived in a very dense subdivision so the trampoline was on the only piece of grass between our back patio and an alleyway that ran behind the houses.  It was just getting dark and a car passed through the alley and my brother waved emphatically at the driver.  I jokingly scolded him saying, ""Stop that!  We might get abducted!""

Then from the bushes on the other side of the alley, a male voice said, ""Yeah, you might get abducted...""

We bolted faster than I thought humanly possible from the trampoline and into the house.  Peeking out the window on the back door we saw a middleaged man in the bushes motioning for us to come out.

We of course did not and instead locked all doors and ran upstairs to my brothers room and armed ourselves with a baseball bat and called our mom.  She obviously called the police and sped home.

When the police aririved they didn't find anyone in the bush.  Their theory was that the college kids living on the otherside of the alley were just playing a prank.  There was a fence there, though, and that man was on our side of the fence and was not college age.

So terrifying that that man had probably been watching us from that bush all evening.  Chills to this day.  Ugh."

Its why I gave up on these kinds of gigs. I will either start my own business or fuck it. I'll go live off the land. Either way I'll have much more fulfilling life than working my ass off to make some lazy shit at the top another million.

"I think it's more delicate than that. Religion tends to be either an *extremely* strong belief (a conviction), or a very important aspect of cultural identity. Being respectful in regards to religion is to 

1. Understand that it's not a bunch of moronic hooligans under the puppet strings of the Pope or whichever, but that's it's a complex and long-lived cultural system with thousands of inputs, millions of personal interpretations, and has persisted for millennia for a *reason*. Not because it is necessarily true, but its persistence and near ubiquity demands of us that we at least respect *why it exists and why so many people believe* without reducing them to idiots, morons, or the insane. There are millions of brilliantly intelligent people who believe, billions of normally intelligent people who believe and can do all the things you and I can do...religious does not equal stupid. And insanity is dependent on behavioral norms. It's illogical to buy lottery tickets beyond the fun of the, yet millions of people do. No one calls them insane because it's such a normal thing to do. Generally the same applies for religion. It's a common behavior, it has a reason to persist, it may be illogical or incorrect, but it's not insane.

2. When engaging in someone with a differing world view and belief system, be actually polite and respectful to that person. No one has ever converted another with a shouting match."

2. It's impossible to get citizenship as a foreigner, China simply doesn't have an immigration system. This is a reason some Chinese abroad don't take foreign passports even when eligible, because it would be so hard (or even impossible) to get their original one back.

3. There is a massive wealth gap, but it false that there is no middle class. China has an absolutely colossal middle class, bigger than the USA in many respects (See McKinsey: Managing China's Urban Billion, 2009)- managing its growth and expectations is one of the biggest challenges the state faces.

4. Chengdu and Guangzhou both have significant expat populations, although there are foreigners scattered about almost everywhere, particularly in schools and universities. Wherever i've been there's always been an expat hangout with enough foreigners to fill a couple of tables at a bar, if not an entire bar.

6. This is true, although definitely changing.

7. It's true that no one ever thinks you can speak Chinese and that on occasion the Japanese get a hard time, while black people always do, the Koreans seem to be just fine. All the Japanese/Koreans I know speak super good Chinese.

7. People are aggressively self centred in public, but it's important also to counterbalance that an understanding of how relationships change when you are introduced to someone or become friends, then it's almost completely the opposite. There is a theory called chaxugeju that explains this.

"My last roommate was like this- she got home 2 hours earlier from work than I did, and would vacuum and clean the whole apartment every day immediately after getting home, including washing the baseboards. After a couple months (during which I asked if she'd like to set up a more formal cleaning schedule several times), she started glaring at me when I came home and saw her cleaning. When I asked her what I could do to improve things, she said ""I guess I just need to learn to let go of some things I can't control in life,"" but still continued with glaring at me and leaving a room whenever I entered it. She also would turn the light off in my bedroom if I walked from my bedroom to the kitchen for a minute to pick up something like a drink or a snack.

"Not a gif or a video, but a story of my father's, passed down from his father from when he witnessed the story at the airport. It's about half past late and everyone works be weary, except he is there. Ali, with his posse. Everyone is inching close, hoping to hear something or see something to take back home. His posse, though, keeps everyone back, to give the tired boxer his space. Somehow, a young boy slips in with a disposable camera and takes a picture, with the flash. Ali sees him, grabs him by the scruff of his shirt and says, loudly, ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"" The little boy is frozen and the crowd quiets; Ali snaps the camera out of the boy's' hands. ""BOY, WHERE IS YOUR MOMMA?"" he asks. The boy runs off, and now the crowd murmurs... they were expecting a gruff and bitter boxer to take hits frustrations out on a poor normal person.Soon enough, mom comes over, pulled by her boy and stammering apologies. Ali points at the bit and says, again loudly, ""MA'AM, IS THIS YOUR BOY?"" She, just like her son, is frozen in fear. He hands her the boy's camera, gets down on a knee next to the boy, puts his gargantuan fist up against her son's head and says, ""take the picture, ma'am,"" with a glint in his eye and a smile on his face.He turns to the boy and asks, loudly again, ""BOY, WHAT DO YOU WANNA BE WHEN YOU GROW UP?"" The boy excitedly replied, ""I wanna box, just like you!"" Ali shook his head, and said, ""no, son... You don't wanna box. Boxing is HURT, and HURTING others. It's pain, and putting others in it. Don't box. Be a doctor, be a teacher, make the world a little better. Don't box.""Then he got on his flight a short bit later. He knew what his job meant. He was wise beyond what you'd expect from his profession."

"This is just not true. The reason paracetamol is one of the most common OTC medicines is due to the very fact that it has a large therapeutic index. Acute hepatotoxicity only becomes a problem at 10g i.e you'd have to swallow 20 standard tablets. Yes you should not exceed more than 4g/day, it's that amount for a reason and obviously REGULARLY exceeding the stated dose will cause problems but no the scenario you described would likely be fine.

Also alcohol and paracetamol are inherently not a good combination but no having a few beers after forgetting you just took 2 tablets of paracetamol does not mean you will need a new liver, it becomes a problem when you talk about doing it regularly or doing it as someone who already has some degree of hepatic impairment. Paracetamol is an extremely safe drug. Having said that, peoples' ignorance re taking multiple formulations that all contain paracetamol is a relatively common issue.

"We, the U.K. are having a vote to stay or leave the EU.. A lot of people believe the cost of us being in the EU is too high, also believe our trade and economy would be better off as well as education and immigration laws. The major UK parties are mostly all for staying in the EU. It's a big deal the government has spent like 9 million of tax payers money advertising 'stay in' which aggravated a lot of people. But in my area, speaking  to people my age (early twenties) and speaking  to my grandma and her neighbours and friends and also my parents and their friend the majority of people are all for leaving. I personally have heard convincing arguments from both sides. But  the point which hit home hardest for me was a guy who was for leaving, he made the point being in the EU isn't democratic at all, because at the end of the day we aren't voting for the leaders of the other countries. I don't know I'm throughly confused as are much of the U.K. TBH."

I guess that gives them good distribution, but that just makes me sad that Ontario's situation isn't better than it is.

- Faucet broke. Had to replace. It was a cheapo one so we bought a much nicer one from a trusted brand.

- Our dishwasher started malfunctioning and wouldn't turn on. Had to hire someone to fix it. This also happened the week our warranty was almost done. Thank god it got done before.

-Our roof was ugly and black. We paid $200 to have it power cleaned. Taking care of your home is important.

Fixing things or replacing things when they go wrong is one thing, but if you're not up for taking care of the home/upkeep, then you're not ready to own a home.

"My thought is that older generations never had time to figure those things out. I'm making an assumption here, but I'd be willing to bet that most people who are the go-to computer assistance people were people who fucked around on computers while they were teenagers/young adults. You've got time to fuck with things. When you're an adult and you've had a kid or three your free time goes down to almost zero.

But you might say 'All they have to do is look it up. It'll take like 15 minutes maybe!' You're wrong. Have you seen someone 55 years old try to google something? It's not just that they're phrasing their search in such a way that they'll get a bunch of irrelevant results, it's that it takes forever for them to process all of the results and ignore the useless ones. We know roughly what we're looking for and we know generally which results are useless to click on. If you read the results page without that heuristic shortcut, it takes much much longer. So, now they're trying to parse some pretty bad results and they're in a feedback loop where it takes too much time to learn how to solve a problem and then they don't gain any background knowledge whatsoever that could help them solve other problems more quickly.

"This isn't true.  If it was then places like SRS would have been banned.

In response the FPH people found pictures of the Imgur admins (low and behold, they were all fat fucks) and started making fun of them.  Imgur admins contacted reddit admins and claimed they were being harassed off site by FPH members, and in response reddit admins banned the FPH sub to keep Imgur happy.  "

"We had abstinence-only education, separated by gender, and all the guys in our classes thought the same until someone figured out that 'girls have three holes down there' and put it in our anonymous question box, asking how would they know which was the right hole?

Now, learning that girls had *three* holes was a relevation for the guys, and I learned from a friend that the girls' side got a more detailed lesson, but learning that guys had *one* hole for both urine and semen was equally relevatory and disgusting for the girls in our class. (She asked me later if it was true, and told me about how the girls had reacted.)

 Anyway, back to the guys. This 'which hole' question was critically important, yet our teacher just said 'you'll know' and moved on to the next question. We were flabbergasted; that wasn't an answer! How the hell were we supposed to know, now?! What happens if we choose wrong? Wtf!?

Well, I figured out later that being in a state with abstinence-only education, we *weren't* supposed to know until we figured it out for ourselves, however we could. Not giving us any useful, practical knowledge was *intentional*.  

For example, though I had been given a box of condoms by my parents when I went to college, I didn't know how to put them on properly until I attended a safe sex seminar run by the campus LGBT group. I didn't know you were supposed to pinch the tip to leave a reservoir and I didn't know that double-wrapping was a bad idea because it makes the condoms easier to break. All the things covered in the safe sex seminar *run by the gay group* were all the essential skills we should have learned in sex ed. Hell, they never told us that dental dams *even existed*, let alone how they were used or what they were for.

Abstinence-only education is a *moronic* and dangerous policy."

"I could write a book.

I’m 34.  My ex and I broke up unexpectedly last year after 5 and a half years, and I decided to get back out there to help me get over it.  I tried a lot of dating sites/apps but I’m partial to OkCupid because people actually write about themselves so you can actually *gasp* learn about them as a person. 

Let me just preface the following by saying that not a single one of the women that I met in the following stories used what I would consider candid photos—they all had gorgeous photos, but in person were just above average.  I understand that people choose flattering photos of themselves, and I’m not that shallow in any case, as long as there’s an attraction, but there’s still an unshakeable feeling of disappointment ensuring that each of these meetings gets off to an inauspicious start.

So the first woman I met was a hard sell.  She seemed smart, gorgeous, and geeky, with great taste in media, plus photos of herself in cosplay.  She played extremely tough to get, but I had a good feeling so I persevered.  Eventually she agreed to a date, and I drove an hour and a half to meet her at her work (she taught comic book art classes) and while things started  off predictably awkward, a connection eventually developed and we had a nice time—the date ended on a park bench with some kissing and hair tussling.  I know she has kids, and she confesses that she has four: a girl and triplet boys, and still little ones.  Wow, ok.  She opens up about her divorce, various struggles in her life… she unloads a lot, but I can see that she’s a very strong person and I find it very attractive. It’s a lot to process, but I’m thinking positively at this point and not deterred.  We made plans to go on another date.  

We went to a Pacman-themed restaurant and had a very fun dinner followed by games, and decided to go to a standup show afterwards.  We’re there like an hour early so we settle in to the front row and start talking.  I ask her a few basic questions about her kids, and she becomes very defensive, and assures me that, ""you're never going to meet them.""  O... k?  How is that supposed to work?  I kind of chalk it up to some combination of her not wanting to introduce a new man to them too soon and/or not wanting me to be scared off by her kids which may be little hellions.  She clearly doesn't want to talk about it, so I shift the conversation elsewhere.

She then raises the question of what’s the kinkiest thing that I’m in to.  A little bold for a second date for my tastes (in a public place no less), but I humor her and start ramping up the list.  She’s 100% unfazed by anything and keeps prodding with, “What else?” and “That’s all?” so at some point I reach my theoretical limit and pass the torch to her.  She then tells me that when her guy friend comes to town, she likes to go to sex dungeons with him.  Huh.  That’s… a thing?  That people do?  In the suburbs?  I’m pretty taken aback because this isn’t something that’s ever crossed my mind, so I’m trying to keep an open mind about it, so I ask questions.  If this is like a hotel room with whips and chains, okay, I guess I can see that, but no—apparently this is a wide open room with lots of people.  Is there actual intercourse?  Oh yes, she assures me.  Like, with strangers?  Of course, how else? 

Okay, still trying to maintain the illusion that I am open-minded about this, but the most salient voice in my mind is laughing that, “I’m a TEACHER.  What if someone saw me?  Even, if there was a little part of me that were interested (there really isn’t), I’m NEVER going to go to a sex dungeon. ”   So after mentally filling out my own little KWL chart on sex dungeons, I’m not sure that this is going anywhere.

The date carries on, the show ends.  At some point during the date it turns out that I must have put my foot in my mouth (not surprising to anyone who knows me, least of all myself), and something rubbed her the wrong way.  I text her later and acknowledge it and apologize in general, and she replies, “It’s okay.  I’m used to guys being assholes on dates.”  I to this day have no idea what I may have said or done to offend her, which is particularly frustrating because that’s one of the things I am very upfront about in my profile—hey, I’m socially stupid, and sometimes when trying to be funny or candid I say things that people take the wrong way, and please just call me on it if I do.  But she refused to tell me.

There was no third date with the sex dungeon mother of 4.

"There's a character who only says 'Hodor' for an unexplained reason. In one of the most recent episodes, his medium cripple friend viewed his past and found out that he went from a normal boy to this character only saying Hodor. It turns out that while cripple was overwatching Hodor's past, in the present, Hodor was running away from enemies with the cripple boy and his lady companion. He was holding a door closed against the enemies as lady companion dragged unconscious cripple boy away, telling Hodor to hold the door. Hodor gets swept up in it and because of some complicated magical things, lady's voice penetrated the vision cripple was having on Hodor's past. Past Hodor is interfered with and hearing the future causes him to have a seizure where he kept repeating, ""hold the door! Hold the door!"" Until the phrase degenerated into ""ho'th'dor"" and eventually to ""Hodor"" and therefore his origin story is told. Present Hodor succums to the hoard of enemies as cripple boy finds out that it's his fault his friend is like this. "

"Less to do with a single rule, rather a bad principal. For the story, read further.

We had a really crappy principal in my final year of high school (the previous one, who was super great, had to leave due to health issues). Essentially, principal prick decided to make a bunch of crap up how the current uniform standard was ""embarrassing"" and how ""other schools were commenting"" (though nobody a. found any proof of that, and b. believed him.) 

When construction on projects the previous principal had finally commenced, prick claimed they were his plans and projects. He also put up *fake* security cameras, while splurging money on other things that made very little sense, like two statues on Patron Saints our school didn't even talk about (we had a couple of others that were the focus), and this one tiny fence that was much more of an inconvenience then anything else (like, literally doing nothing but go halfway onto the pathway, and not even guarding anything.)

People started complaining (as you would expect, because this meant that there was an ""unforeseen"" increase of school fees that year). People were also getting beaten up even worse, because of course the cameras weren't gonna do anything (They didn't hide the wires that well, and some were actually cracked, busted, or missing, while the higher-ups still claimed that everywhere was monitored and that all the cameras were ""working."") Eventually, he held an assembly, and essentially proclaimed that all projects that garnered negativity had been the result of the old good principal, and that if prick was to be blamed, you'd get a detention.

He also made sure to extort any money or see any reason to punish. Right before ANZAC Day, and I quote, ""If you do not march on that day, you will be given a month of detention, and you will not be allowed to participate in any school events. I do not care if you have to move all the way from Gympie, this is about the schools honor."" Obviously, people didn't take too kindly to that, especially since many were already marching elsewhere (myself included), and while he didn't actually stick with the punishment, the mere fact he had threatened us with that had obviously pissed a shit load of people off. You'd also get punished if you didn't pick up rubbish (that wasn't yours), despite his ever-so-careless actions with disposal, and the fact he wouldn't get of his arse to do it himself.

Probably Neil Armstrong of Buz Aldrin.I think at least one of them is still alive.  I think space exploration will be a huge thing in 500 years. Humans probably will be searching for other possible planets to inhabit. As far as Art/Literature goes; Steven King. Authors tend to be well remembered throughout history. People known for their wealth tend to not fare as well unless they contribute allot to public works and charities. I dont think think technology pioneers will be household names either. People 500 years from now will be using entirely different things than what we use today.

"A lot of problems just don't have solutions. Or only have solutions that cost more than the problem. You can't just make a coworker not be annoying or make your commute traffic free. You could quit your job, but that's likely to create more problems than it solves. 

I tend to be pretty stoic about such things as well, but for some people talking about them is a way to make them less bothersome. Knowing that another person understands and sympathizes with what happened can lift off some of the anger, frustration, or whatever. Plus, talking through something often helps a person realize the problem was not that big a deal in the first place and can release that emotional energy.  "

"I was four when the war began, a lot luckier than my sister who was ten at the time. 

&gt;I remember reading how otherwise-peaceful neighbors that had known each other for a very long time turned on each other in part due to religion.

Yes, can definitely confirm this. It's exactly what happened to us. I'm a 'halfie' (half Muslim, half Orthodox). During the first months of the siege (we were hiding in our basement at the time), the village that we lived in fell under Bosnian Serb rule. One of our old neighbours knocked on our door and told us that they'd kill mum and us kids if we didn't gtfo immediately. We didn't need more of a warning, we left immediately and hid somewhere else (dad was also refusing to join the army, hence why there was a lot of hiding). The war was crazy, and complicated and a complete tragedy. However, there was still a lot of human kindness - particularly from people who saw past the bullshit politics. If those people hadn't existed, I doubt we would have ever made it out of the country! "

- Dishonesty. My friendships, or any relationship, relies on trust. Lie to me, means I cannot trust you. Also, if I confide in you, don't break that.



- Disrespect. Treat me how I should be treated. We can be assholes to each other, but have my best interest at heart.



- Negativity. If everything you say or do is negative, I can't handle it. I will help all I can, but you have to help yourself too.

"I should add the obligatory 'I'm not a cop, but...' to this, but only because the abusive relationship spousal murder reminded me of something I'd rather forget.

In the area of England I live in, crime is more something you hear about happening to other people. It's not often you come face to face with a crime scene yourself. We don't have gun violence, fatalities from knife crime are relatively low. I've only ever once felt unsafe despite working in a city. It's that kind of a place.

So I have an early shift at work on a Monday. I'm in for 7am at the office. When I arrive, the forecourt is blocked off with cops and police tape. One of my managers is standing outside directing office staff to the car park entrance at the rear of the building which we never use because it's just a fire door. She can't tell me what's going on, we don't have full information yet. From the evidence tent I can tell someone has been badly hurt. My first thought is 'it must be a fight, maybe the homeless people' because there are a **lot** of homeless people in and around the nearby alley and fights aren't uncommon among them.

I go to get a coffee, text my boyfriend who works in the same building to let him know he might have to go in through the other door.

When I get inside the building and to the third floor (I take the lift/elevator because it's early and I'm tired) speculation is already rife. My colleagues assume the same as I did; it's a homeless person. They do say they think they died, and talk about them as if it doesn't matter because they're homeless. I tell them that - homeless or not - it's still a fucking tragedy and suggest we all start working because guessing at what happened isn't helping.

My first mistake was taking the stairs when I went on a break that morning. The stairwell is glass fronted and you can see clearly into the forecourt. There's a lot of blood in front of the building and up the street to a nearby dumpster type bin, the blue kind that can be found throughout the city. It's been running down the slight incline and into the gutter. There's blood on the glass as if whoever was hurt tried to get into the building, there are evidence tags on the ground, a large blue tent covering the crime scene, and I feel sick knowing that a person was out there and subjected to something that made them lose that much blood.

I get back to work and try to forget what I saw, but my mind can't help drifting back to that.

Managers trickle onto the floor, seeking out specific people and quietly asking them to come to meeting rooms. They're to take their things with them. They don't return to their desks.

Then comes the email.

It wasn't a homeless person.

She was one of those girls you knew by sight even if you didn't talk to her. She stood out. She was alternative, bright, always wearing cool shoes or a nice jacket that made you comment on it. She was happy to accept a compliment and give one in turn. She was the kind of girl you'd wonder about if she didn't turn up for a while even though she was in another department and we didn't often interact.

She was twenty-four, if I recall.

She'd separated from her husband who (obviously) had a lot of issues. He posted revenge porn on his Facebook page, talked about doing something but people didn't take him seriously. He went to meet with her on Sunday to return some things but 'forgot' one of them. He went home, armed himself with a set of knives, and then returned.

At about 8pm he confronted her outside of our office building. It was light out. The city was still busy. Our office is central in the city with a taxi rank beside it and coffee shops. The forecourt is never really empty. And that's where he stabbed her repeatedly, while her friend tried to save her and was also injured, in front of perhaps thirty witnesses who begged him to get away from her. The police arrested him at the scene, and there was no question of his guilt, even if his friends posted on Facebook that he was 'innocent until proven guilty'.

I will never forget that day.

My colleagues and I were crying in the corridors. A heavy atmosphere settled over the building for more than a week after it happened. We were in shock, feeling like we should all grieve and feeling awkward about doing it because we didn't personally know her, but at the same time feeling the sting of her loss because we knew her by sight. Now and then someone would burst into tears at their desk and it would spark a chain of sobbing across the office floor. Relative strangers hugged each other outside the building on cigarette breaks. We all patiently waited for lifts up and down the floors because no one could bear to take the stairs and look down on the place where she'd died.

My boyfriend came home ashen faced after finishing the late shift that Monday night. They'd let staff out of the front door, and he had to step over her blood to leave. He had to remove her profile from the computer database. He said that he'd only ever had to do that when people quit or got fired, never because they'd been murdered on the doorstep. It was days before all the blood was cleaned off the street. There was still some there when we laid flowers for her.

I still feel sick when I look at that dumpster where she died. I don't feel safe out there at night. I know it was a targeted attack and unlikely to happen to me, but the illusion of comfort and familiarity are gone.

So that was the worst crime scene I ever saw.

The murder scene of a girl I worked with."

But it sometimes surprises me how little people know themselves; my exex bf was already 28 when he was sure that he never ever wants kids, now 5 years later he desperately wants some. 
Same with a good friend of mine. She didn't want kids, till she was 33. For me it was always very clear that I once want kids and it's hard for me to understanding how someone can change the opinion on that 180 degree. 

Or when guys become fathers who didn't want kids and suddenly it's the best thing in their live and they never want to go back. Like, how could you not anticipate this? I don't think that they are adapting to the situation.

"This happened to me in middle school as well. Boys were ruthless to me (in middle school they were worse bullies than girls were). Ahhhhh, the joys of having a high forehead while being ugly and having a mother who makes you dress in frumpy, unfashionable clothing. Anyway this guy who knew I had a crush on him asked me out in front of a good chunk of the school and made sure everyone was listening. After I said yes, he starts hysterically laughing and said something like, ""ew I was joking, as if I'd ever go out with your ugly ass..."" and then walked away back to his friends who were pointing and making fake sad faces at me. 

Once I reached high school I became considerably more attractive, dressed better (due to getting a job and being able to buy my own clothes), and more well known because I got noticed by a guy in grade 12 who was super popular and started dating him. The guys who relentlessly bullied me started kissing my ass...and the one kid who did the fake ask out would *constantly* bring up the time, ""HEY RamenHair, remember that time I asked you out as a joke!!!! LOLOLOL"" and it was always in front of people. However people would always call him out on it, either saying how much of an asshole he was back then, and how he's making himself look like a moron by bringing it up now. "

"I've done development in the past but now I do software testing, the majority of the programs we produce run as Windows services and they're designed to work over networks. To streamline things I wrote a utility that displays (in a list box) the IP addresses of the system/virtual machine it's running on and has single-click buttons to do the following:

* Release an IP address (defaults to the list boxes currently selected IP)
* Renew an IP address (defaults to the list boxes currently selected IP)
* Dialog box for Ping (opens prepopulated with the currently selected IP and the last octet is pre-selected).
* Launch dcomcnfg (which includes event viewer and service manager)
* Launch Task Manager
* Launch Device Manager

* Open a command prompt
* Launch the Add/Remove Programs app

* Register a service (file dialog to select the app)
* Unregister a service
* Open an Explorer window to our products' default installation folder (in Program Files)
* Open an Explorer window to our products' data folder (in Program Files\Common Files)

In addition, it contains two other apps that are copied to the desktop the first time you run it; one is an in-house designed equivalent to perfmon (optimized to only monitor values important to us) and the other parses and reformats XML files so they're easily readable in notepad.

"My MIL is a fundamentalist Christian who pretends to like me, but I know if I broke up with her son she would be more than overjoyed.  

Over the past 10 years she has said and done things that show her true colours.  Myself and her ex-pastor son are atheists, his parents are relentless and creative in their tactics for us to return to the fold.  She has said some incredibly rude things about non-Christians.  What she doesn't consider, is this is one of the many reasons why we don't believe or participate.

Ok, so I don't like fruit pies...big fucking whoop.  This became a big deal to her.  When we first started dating she told my SO ""she's not like us"" when he questioned her about it she told him it was because I don't like pie.  He basically rolled his eyes at her.
Yah, so for EVERY birthday for 6 years she'd bake me an apple pie.  I'd politely choke down a piece, and she would stand smiling her fucking face off and then say 'oh! right you don't like pie.  You shouldn't feel like you need to eat that for my benefit.'  
My saving grace is I'm a clean eater now (over 60lbs down) and I don't eat sugar, meat, flour, etc.  This has also created its own issue.  I'm very appreciative when we are invited for a meal....even though I now have to bring my own food.  She will not stop putting marshmallows on the sweet potato, sugar in the peas, bacon fat in her salad dressing, heaps of butter and sour cream in the potatoes, and then complains to me she can't seem to get to the same weight as me.
She's got 30+ years on me and every time she sees me she asks my current weight, and when I tell her I don't know she'll pout and grumble under her breath about it.

Bitch, I work out every fucking day and I basically eat vegetables.  This is not fucking easy, and it's also not for everyone.  I don't judge anyone for their weight-that's your shit to deal with I have plenty of my own baggage I'm lugging around.  She's actually grabbed my hips and jiggled me like a side a beef trying to guess.  
Don't get me wrong, I really do love and appreciate her and what she has done for us.  I feel that she's made zero attempt to get to know me (she basically knows where I work and where I live) but has never asked me about my life..ever.  She has no fucking clue that both my brothers are gay (haha!)

"I don't know any married couples that operate this way.  To me, if I really love someone to the core and she makes less, idgaf what % of the bills I pay and the same goes for all my friends and family.  Calculating what each person pays when you're married seems petty.  As long as she isn't going out and spending all our money on stupid shit, I'd rather pool it together.

That and when you've pooled it together and pay one bill...say about 150 and I make 33% more than her - in reality I'm still paying 2/3rds.  We're just not tediously splitting things up on paper rather than simply paying the thing.  Buying a house for 600k for example.  If we've both been saving for a house and neither of us buy stupid shit in the meantime, I'm still paying for 66% of it, because I put 66% into the savings.

I'm pretty sure there have been studies done showing that married couples that never had a joint bank account don't end up doing too well in terms of marriage in the long run.

"A year ago I was driving home from college. It's a 3 hour drive and you cross the boonies to get between the two destinations. 

On my way home I realized I had forgotten to get gas. So i took an exit off of the freeway into a small town to get gas. I pulled up to what I guess was a locally owned gas station cause it was closed but you could still use your debit/credit card. 

I pulled up to the pump and heard movement in the tree line to the west of me. As I looked over I saw two huge guys emerging from the tree line running straight at me with masks on. I ran back into my car and drove away with them only a few feet away from me. 

I called the cops and gave my statement. Apparently those two guys have already badly beaten a few people and killed one and are hitting different towns. "

"Ok two things. 1) Girls are conditioned from childhood to know that you don't talk about menstruation *ever*. Because it's disgusting and shameful, because reasons. Grown women don't talk about their periods outside of close friend groups and certainly not in casual conversation with mixed company. That's how you get ostracized for being that weird person. 

2) How comfortable were you as a teen talking about the changes your body was experiencing? My guess is you, like many teens, were pretty self conscious about the changes you were experiencing and broaching the subject in school and opening yourself up for comments about it probably weren't something you would have enjoyed.  

2A) How much sensitivity and maturity do you think a teenage boy will handle information about bodily processes that he has no experience with and has been socially conditioned to think is dirty? 

Your problem isn't with the fact that your female peers didn't talk about it, it's the way we treat menstruation as a society.  "

"Not creepy at all. His commentary is never abruptly too loud. He speaks very evenly, and there is just something about his voice that is very calming.

There is evidence that if you are having trouble sleeping and you MUST watch something as opposed to reading or doing something else, it shouldn't be to visually complex and it helps if the video is familiar. Most people would recommend an old favorite movie that is black and white.  Isaac has a very limited color palette, and has just enough newness with the item combinations to not feel old, but each episode is visually and audio wise quite similar. It's a very good compromise to watching the same movie over and over. Just enough new to keep you entertained if you can't sleep, but not enough stimulus to prevent sleep should it start occuring."

"I struggled with heavy depression for years, but I feel very much in control of it now, so I'll try to give you the most realistically achievable tips.

First, and this has to happen over time, I had to identify a lot of the things that would trigger or worsen my depression, and remove as much of that from my life as possible. 

For me, feeling trapped or stuck in a situation was a huge trigger, and I found once I had as much independence as possible I felt better(living on my own, having a car, and eventually working from home too). It took me years to get these things, but because I knew it was what I needed I could take the steps to work towards them. So basically, identify your triggers, and set goals to eliminate what you can, and overcome what's unavoidable.

I have a huge struggle with intrusive thoughts, both when I felt depressed, and even when I felt ok. For some reason, these intrusive suicidal thoughts would pop up for no reason. But, I found a very easy coping mechanism was for me to, each time I have one, touch an important object to me that represents who and where I am now. It's like a grounding object, I touch it and know I'm more than the intrusive thoughts. This also works great for times when you're stuck remembering cringey moments of the past and you feel like you can't escape the thoughts. 

Having a pet is also helpful, because it does give me an immediate reason to get up every morning. And having something to take care of/groom is very soothing.

Hope this helps."

Perfect in every aspect if you ask me.

"It's funny, I had the opposite experience. I find women's deodorants keep me drier and fresher than my past men's deodorants.

The strong-smelling men's deodorants would rub off on the inside of my clothes over time and cause a buildup in the armpits, even when I didn't use much. This would stiffen the fabric and cause a buildup of bacteria which would smell rough after a while.

It would take several hot-water washes with antibacterial detergent, tons of bicarbonate of soda massaged into the armpits and hanging in sunlight just to remove the problem, and it still managed to destroy a shirt or two.

After I switched to milder women's deodorants the problem never returned, not even once. No BO, no odour in the fabric and I smell like glorious fucking lavender."

If it were legal at 18, colleges could throw drinking events and such. "

"Like Bear Grylls. Whatever you think of his show the man is still a beast.

""In 1996, he suffered a freefall parachuting accident in Zambia. His canopy ripped at 4,900 metres (16,000 ft), partially opening, causing him to fall and land on his parachute pack on his back, which partially crushed three vertebrae. Grylls later said: ""I should have cut the main parachute and gone to the reserve but thought there was time to resolve the problem"".[20] According to his surgeon, Grylls came ""within a whisker"" of being paralysed for life and at first it was questionable whether he would ever walk again. Grylls spent the next 12 months in and out of military rehabilitation at Headley Court[20] before being discharged from his medical treatment and directing his efforts into trying to get well enough to fulfil his childhood dream of climbing Mount Everest.""

As a Scot (so not involved immediately - the IRA never targeted Scotland) - it was very interesting to see the change in opinion from those in the US, and particularly Boston/NYC et al who had been supporting (and financially supporting) the IRA as 'Freedom Fighters' when they had never experienced what it was like to fear being blown to bits for decades or to have paramilitaries from both sides mete out street justice.

"This dude came from an odd family.  I think they were quite poor, and had like 5 kids.  One was disabled, in a wheelchair for some reason.  I'm willing to bet they were previously homeschooled too because they seemed to come out of nowhere (but perhaps they moved in from elsewhere, though that doesn't happen much in such a small town).  

Anyway, this guy would wear all black, including a trenchcoat.  He was probably 95 pounds and almost 6' tall.  He purposely cultivated an aura of mystery, but nobody actually cared.  He was just a ""loser"".  In a small town, there aren't enough losers to make them their own clique really.  Instead, it's just like the three or four people who have no choice but to hang out with each other.  

Our biggest loser in school was a kid nicknamed Beaver because of his buck teeth.  We were a creative bunch.  One time in 7th grade, a teacher called him Beaver in class.  He got mad and everyone else laughed.  She didn't realize it was a nickname thrust on him, not a legitimate nickname.  But that seemed to further solidify it.

So this tall creepy motherfucker became best friends with Beaver.  They'd play Magic daily in the cafeteria.   While Beaver was friendly enough, the creepy dude made a point of anti-social behavior.  He never seemed pleased to be talking to people.  He was condescending, pompous.  Beaver was just socially awkward, but a decent dude otherwise  and a big nerd.

The creepy dude had this go to line when people tried to talk to him too much.  I generally would talk to anyone and didn't care about social status.  They'd play Counter-Strike in the computer lab with me and others after school, so I felt like I knew them a bit.  Therefore I'd be friendly with them when I saw them, and have conversations.  Or at least try to.  Creepy dude would try his best to push me away.  His go to line was ""I know 97 ways to kill someone with a popcicle stick.""  I replied, ""Wouldn't one be enough?""  

I imagine it was bullshit.  Or some stupid 4chan list.  I didn't think he'd murder anyone.  He was just a normal dude, but a loner who probably thought of himself as better than everyone else.  

During Homecoming Week every day was a different dress up day.  For example, ""Hippie Day"".  On ""Emo Day"", of course the whole school was going to dress more or less like creepy dude.  By the way, I forgot to mention he had like really long hair, down to his waist at least.  So, I spike my hair, put on a dog collar and wear nothing but black, to show my school spirit.  Most everyone else wears black that day too.  Except for this creepy fucker.  He shows up on Emo Day dressed with a white Scooby Doo t-shirt and blue jeans.  Fucker.

If he spent less time thinking about what people thought of him, he'd probably have been a pretty cool guy.  Instead he was just another loser trying too hard."

You should also not go out in public unless absolutely necessary when you're sick. A few weeks ago I was at work, where I don't sell anything of any immediate importance, a woman came in talking about how she has whooping cough. She even talked about how contagious it was and said ""I hope I give it to you"" because I couldn't find her receipt in our system (when you pay cash and insist on not giving your info keep your receipts cause it's hard for us to find them).  So far I don't seem to have whooping cough but the idea of her going around doing her stupid errands infecting people drives me nuts. "

Most of their songs were written with a variation of 3-4 chords. However AC/DC stand out to me because they are so consistent. They never did a Metallica ""Saint Anger"" album that was highly unpopular among fans (I liked it but apparently most didn't) and you can pick up any album from 1975-2015 and you can say 100% that is an AC/DC album. 

Any song they play could be on any one of their albums from their entire discography, the only difference is the Singer (Rock In Peace Bon). I use AC/DC as the guide post for a bands consistency. The highest possible ranking being AC/DC and the lowest possible ranking being someone like Lady Gaga who has sung songs from countless different writers all with their own style. Im not saying its a bad thing im saying its not consistent as a musician. "

"SpongeBob, Eminem, LOTR, Harry Potter was starting to get huge, the GTA games for the PS2 (specifically, GTA 3 and Vice City), Halo, South Park was starting to get really good, Family Guy, Yu-Gi-Oh, Survivor, Futurama, Shrek, Naruto, etc.

A lot of 90s trends were still going on, like Furby, Tamagotchi, Beanie Babies, frosted tips, boy bands, Aaron Carter, Pokémon and even Pogs in some places.

Nickelodeon was still awesome, with shows like the aforementioned SpongeBob, which was still good at this time, Fairly OddParents, Jimmy Neutron, Rugrats, Hey Arnold, Rocket Power, The Wild Thornberrys, Invader Zim, etc. Cartoon Network was great as well, with shows like Samurai Jack, Powerpuff Girls, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Ed, Edd N Eddy, Codename Kids Next Door, Time Squad, etc. Although CN would become shit later in the decade, it would have a revival in the early 2010s. Disney Channel was booming during this period, after being everyone's last resort channel in the 90s, with shows like Even Stevens, Recess, The Proud Family, Kim Possible, Lizzie McGuire, That's So Raven, and more.

In addition, a lot of 90s shows, like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Friends, The X-Files, Dawson's Creek, Ally McBeal, Angel, Frasier, Sex and the City, That 70s Show, Will and Grace, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, etc., were still running at this time.

I dunno man, the early 00s were such a weird time. It felt almost identical to the 90s pop culturally (except for a couple of things which I listed above), but with a lot of political and social turmoil (9/11, the War on Terror, Iraq War, etc.) Yet it's still a very nostalgic time for me."

"&gt; This is VERY useful in situations where you take video evidence of police brutality and cops either delete the video themselves or if they demand you delete it under threat of arrest.

Unrelated but I kinda wanna go on a tangent here. 

A few weeks ago I covered my first violent protest as a journalist. Journalists stay at the very front of the protest so they can interview cops and populist leaders, as well as take photos - and we all have a press badge and arm band with ""Press"" written on it.

A more experienced journalist friend told me that in case the protest turned into a riot and the cops took weapons out, I had to hide my press band and badge, and run in the middle of the melee. I asked why, and was a bit shocked to hear that many cops are known to be specifically aiming to harm journalists first of all. The point is either to make journalists flee or have them harmed enough they are unable to do their job. In a riot, cops go all out and acts of police brutality are plenty ; if there is a journalist to record it, the cops will get in trouble, while civilians recording brutality are far easier to manage.

That was the useless lil' tidbit of the day, thank you for your attention :D"

"True, however that's unlikely to be in public. Which is where most people freak out about guys talking to kids. 

It mostly happens when said relative or family friend is alone with the kid, like when they're baby sitting or something. And the sex of the abuser is roughly even between men and women, it just so happens the stereotype is that men are pedophiles.

Which fucking sucks. I'm a big guy, with a beard and I look enough like Santa that kids ask if I'm his cousin (the answer is always yes). 

I also work at several kids camps, two owned by my family and one where I do maintenance and such. People give me odd looks or are distrusting and standoffish to me, where my female coworkers would get a smile or the opposite reaction.

Now granted, it's usually a pretty small percentage of people that react like that. Most people don't have an issue or are fairly good at hiding it. But that small number really matters. One wrong accusation or slip up and I'm likely to be fired (not from the family one most likely) or my reputation is gone for good. Sometimes it's like walking on eggshells with how I can interact and teach kids.

The fact that you legitimatelly believe in what you're saying/doing means you're not manipulating, but you may be manipulated into thinking/behaving this way. 

Who is most powerful? That manipulative boyfriend or that guy who's able to dictate trends by his social/economical branches? You and your friends can notice that your boy may be a bad one, but how can you notice if your perception of what is good isn't manipulated by someone who will profit from it somehow?

In this garden there is this little bridge that goes over this dry creek that is used to go to another part of the garden. Me and my friends jokingly put up a mini stone wall in front of it and held the bridge for a couple of lunches. Now there wasn't really much on the other side of the bridge, just some rocks and a tree, but a lot of kids would try to get past us. We eventually said that everyone who could guess the password could get past. The best part was that there was no password. So somehow the teachers thought we had a special club that needed a password to join. We, being the stupid children we were, refused to stop doing this and eventually came a rule that disallowed all clubs on campus not approved by the principal and some other important people.

"A lot of people's opinions on pedophilia are extremely primative and unhelpful. Don't get me wrong, I'm in no way condoning child molesters, and anyone who crosses that line can be thrown into the deepest flaming pit for all I care. But people who experience sexual attraction towards underage people, but who haven't acted on those urges yet, both deserve and need to be helped, so that they can better control those urges and prevent 'the unthinkable' from happening. But fat chance of that ever happening in the current world.  

Though, admittedly, I'm not exactly looking forward to the day that fight starts happening in public and everyone starts phoning in their opinions on it, like what we just went through with homosexual marriage and are currently going through with trans-rights. I'm just going to count my lucky stars that, despite all my personal 'deviancy', this particular one wasn't among them. Fuck having to deal with that. "

The car hit the ditch and went airborne, hit a small tree turning it side ways.  The car then hit an oak tree and split in half, throwing the front half with mom still buckled another 20 yards down a ravine, and the back half spun around back towards the road.  The kids were thrown, the little boy survived miraculously with minor injuries, and the girl's head smacked a telephone pole, dead instantly.  

I arrived and the woman was being strapped down to a stretcher screaming for us to kill her, blood pouring from a 6in gash in her leg.  The boy was already loaded in the ambulance, and fire was working on the little girl, as she hadnt been declared yet.  I was still pretty fresh off field training and I had seen some shit, but this was something else.  The ground was soaked and a muddy mess from rain, and there was blood and debris everywhere.  I noticed kids shoes and little toys strewn everywhere, and when I saw the little girl and how mangled her face was I had to walk away before I could pull it together to start helping direct traffic and assist Fire/EMS.  The whole scene was surreal."

"So, there was a guy named Willis in my middle school.

He was pretty weird-looking, and he had a nerdy voice, kind of like [that guy in the Simpsons](https://bloggingaboutbaseball.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/simpsonsnerd.gif?w=700), and he lived with his old mom, and no dad.

He liked to be the ""Dungeon Master"" for D&amp;D games that were just narration; no dice, no character sheets; just him talking.

He always had great lunches, in my estimation: Lunchables, Little Debbies, pudding cups, doritos...all the shit that I wasn't allowed to have.

So, I used to take his lunch all the time.  I didn't just grab it; I would ask him for parts of it, and he would always say 'yes'.

I would also make fun of his voice and do an impression of him as the DM: ""So...you're walking down this path, and you see a strange object...""  Sort of funny if you knew him and were a ruthless middle-school jerk, as I apparently was, but mean and cruel, and not cool, considering how much of his lunch I ate.

Anyhow.  Time passed.  HS and college and all that shit.  About 20 years after I last saw him, I recognized him at the library.

He kind of looked the same, but he had clearly had it rough.  His teeth used to just be buck and big; now, they were chewed up and brown.  He smelled strongly, and was dressed in dirty and odd-looking clothes.  He was pretty obviously homeless.

I am ashamed to say that I just turned and walked away.

Since then, I have seen him a few times, and I actually talked to him for a while.  He is staying in a room with his now-very-elderly mother, so he's not technically homeless, but he doesn't have a job, and doesn't have a HS diploma.  The last time I saw him, he was at McDonalds, getting a fish sandwich for his mom.

I insisted on paying for the food, and gave him a ride back to his 'house' (which is a room in a group-home/halfway house thing).  He (rightly) was not that psyched about seeing me, or letting me pay for lunch, or getting a ride, but he was pretty broke, and it started raining, so...he relented.

There's no good end to this crappy story.

I feel like shit.

I was a dick to him a long time ago, and his life is really hard now.

He doesn't like me, and I don't blame him.

I could do more to help him, but I haven't.

I always thought he'd grow up to be a computer guy, but he said he can't afford a computer right now.

IDK.

Be nice to 'that guy', folks.

Otherwise, you may be confronted with the reality of your own asshole-hood, somewhere down the line."

"Attended scene/autopsy of a 13 year old who was hunting with his 11 year old brother and accidentally shot him dead center in the back of the head with a slug meant for deer. The kid looked bad enough when I got there and had already expired - his face looked like a facehugger if you want context. 

Feel really really bad for the brother as he attempted to do CPR and stuff (obviously in a panic as his brother was likely just expelling blood everywhere and not actually still alive). This poor kid will not only remember shooting his little brother but actually seeing the aftermath and putting his face on it. Obviously far worse for the kid than anyone else."
"My dad used to be part of the force in Korea before we moved. It was a small neighborhood and relatively quiet and ""well-off"", if you ignored the countless episodes of abuse that kids went through in Korea without being reported. Anyways, my dad told me about this case pretty recently, because according to him, the experience actually influenced him to move to America for a better life for his children, in fear that he would marry a tiger mom in disguise (lol).

Okay, so this was a classic Tiger Mom situation -- she beat her kids and forced them to practice piano every single day as well as study, and they were visibly bruised when my dad and his partners stormed the house after they received a distress call. This wasn't surprising as the kids were regular callers, but somehow the mom always found a way to clean up and threaten her kids into saying nothing once the police got to the house. This was the first time my dad was sent on their case, after many, many calls. Poor kids. 

By the time he got to the part where the station got the call, I expected it to be from the poor, abused kids. Nope. It was the mom. She was screaming at full blast into the phone as a few dull thuds echoed in the background, as well as the sobs of a child.

Turns out the 15 year old jumped the mom with a baseball bat when she started slamming his brother's head on the piano keys. Her brother received several cuts and some scabs and wounds were reopened after being hit on the piano. Unable to watch his brother be abused any longer, he had left the room for a drink of water, but instead returned with his bat and whacked the mom over the head. He then continued to beat her on the back as she was on the floor, his brother clutching his shorts and crying, trying to staunch the blood coming from all over his head. She was bruised, bleeding profusely, and some parts of her face had swelled to the point beyond recognition. She'd also lost a couple teeth, which were floating peacefully in a little pool of her blood. How pleasant.

My dad isn't sure what happened to the family after, but he did mention something that the kids were let off relatively safely because the attack was justified as self-defense. Obviously, one of the brothers had the head wounds, and both of them had many scars to prove the degree of abuse. But the mother did receive brain damage and permanent damage to certain parts of her arm. 

But honestly, cases like these are easily overlooked in Korea. The traditional teaching style of abuse, harsh words, and criticism really justifies all these horrible events of abuse. I don't condone harming another person, but honestly? In these kids' situation, I don't blame them."

"I just got back from a 4 day trip (friend got married across the country so we booked a hotel out there) and obviously my boyfriend came too, leaving our 3 cats at home (with people stopping in to feed and play with them of course!). Their different reactions to us getting back had me cracking up for days.

First I should point out that my bf doesn't live with me and the cats, but he stays 2-3 nights a week on set nights so they know when to expect him, and we were away during *those* nights so the cats were already unhappy enough that their daddy was missing, mummy being gone too (only been away 2 days in their entire lives before) meant some serious sulking. 

The youngest and clingiest boy spent the first 18 hours (I came home ill so stayed in bed) curled up on top of me refusing to move. Every time I tried to even change position he'd make eye contact and look so so so betrayed that I'd just go back where he wanted me again. 

The other boy started his guilt trip the second I got out the car. He normally sees either me or my boyfriend through the window then runs to the flat door to wait to meet us there. This time I got out and he just held eye contact and let out huge long sobbing meows, over and over until after I had gone through the main building door, almost as though he didn't want to lose sight of me just in case I disappeared again. Once the door was open he crawled up my leg into my arms and sobbed for cuddles. He spent the next 15 mins walking my boyfriend around the flat pointing out ""this food dispenser is almost empty"" and ""this water fountain needs a top up"" and glaring until the job was finished. Once everything was satisfactory he crawled into my sickbed and just rolled all over me purring his lil head off for hours.

The oldest, our only girl had me giggling for hours though. She's always been the shy one and is VERY independent, but still likes her cuddles; on her own terms of course. She hid in the corner of my bedroom and glared at me for hours while I was sleeping off my illness. Every hour or so she would run over and meow for attention, get a quick head rub or stroke, then swatt me and run off again. After about 6 hours of ""i want you but I don't want you"" I fell into a deep sleep and woke up to her totally flat out on top of me with her head snuggled into my shoulder snoozing away. Almost as soon as I woke up she did, we made eye contact, and she did a perfect 'rabbit in the headlights - oh shit I'm caught' expression before scuttling off back to her glaring spot.

I was fully forgiven by the tribe within 2 days but my boyfriend is still being hit up for extra treats and head rubs. I can't imagine what they would do after a month apart - I'm scared of the riots it would cause tbh. These cats like their routine.

"&gt; it's all about the value you bring.

No, it's not. It's about the **perceived** value you bring. I mean, technically, that's what value is anyway. But here's what I mean:

In a field where quality of work can be easily quantified (e.g. a factory line assembly worker) then the numbers tend toward the workers' actual value (""Worker A outputs 10% more widgets than Worker B, so he'll get paid 10% more.)

But for a position like a CEO, their pay is based on the perception of others. Not that that's a bad thing, but it's not always accurate. An extreme example would be Enron's executives getting paid plenty even though they were of *negative* value to the people setting their salary.

How on Earth would you determine the value of a CEO's contribution? There's only one CEO, so you can't compare them to anyone else (you can compare contemporary CEO's, but not at the same business) and top-level decisions have so many variables. They depend so much on the competency of their staff, economic conditions, and sometimes they just get lucky or unlucky.

It's no surprise that CEO's get paid more than the average worker, and I'm not saying they shouldn't. But [can we really be sure that their pay accurately reflects their value?](https://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_1920w/Boston/2011-2020/2014/10/26/BostonGlobe.com/Business/Images/ceopay2graf.jpg)

The Story?

There's a lil old town (it's pretty big actually) called Bristol in the UK, in this wonderful town is a zoo, and as every zoo has, there is a car park right next to it and just up the hill is a larger one in a field.

Every single day without a shadow of a doubt this lovely gentleman works taking £3 per car to park in this lovely little car park just up the road.

Years went by and not a single day passed he did not turn up to work on time all day doing the same job, car after car after car rolled in paying £3 to park there.

So one day he didn't turn up for work.. then again he didn't turn up and suddenly Bristol zoo decided to ask the Council why they haven't replaced him, but then the Bristol Council said 'We though you hired him?'

So the craziest thing this guy has done? took upwards of £3 million it was estimated from the Bristol Zoo or Bristol Council!

"I'm going to clear this up, as I've interact with some of the BTTF crew, like Bob Gale, as well as Jeffrey Weissman and have actually talked with Crispin Glover about this. What you've stated is mostly from Glover's point of view, which is not wrong, but not the full picture. 

The BTTF producers didn't want Glover in the sequels. According to them, he was difficult to work with and rein in during the first film, and they had actually written a script for Part 2 purposefully cutting George out as much as possible and making the part seem unappetizing for Glover (I learned from Glover that the uncomfortable upside-down contraption that Old George is in wasn't done to obscure Weismann's face further -as I had always thought- but was actually in the script Glover was given).

They also tried to lowball him in pay, though the producers say that Glover asked for as much or more money than Fox. Either way, the producers didn't want George in the film so that they didn't have to work with Glover, and they got their wish. BUT, they still needed to have George in there somewhat because they were returning to the events of the first film, where George features prominently. So they hired Wiesmann (who is actually one of the nicest, funniest people you'll ever meet) to essentially be an impersonator, mimicking Glover-as-George's performance, mannerisms and voice. 

Glover sued (and got a settlement) but not for the reason most people think. According to Glover, it wasn't the re-use of the Part 1 footage that he sues for, but the fact that the procedures were actively trying to trick the audience into thinking that Glover was actually still performing in the film. Weissman got in trouble with the producers for requesting a credit at the beginning of the film, because it was all supposed to be a secret that Glover wasn't in the film anymore. If they had just recast the part (like they did with Jennifer.. from Claudia Wells to Elizabeth Shue) and let the new actor perform with his own face (or just in old man make-up) there would be no issue. But the producers used Glover's face casts from the first film to recreate his face with prosthetics so that Weismann as ""Young George"" looked just like him and the audience couldn't tell it wasn't Glover. Essentially, it was using Glovers celebrity and popularity to try and sell a film that he wasn't actually in. (I'm sure the re-use footage without permission thing played some part, but it was not a major part of case, which was more about misrepresentation.)

Ultimately, as a BTTF fan, I think it's a fascinating situation and it actually got the Screen Actor's Guild rules changed regarding actor's likeness use in contracts. "

"I think it'd be really disconcerting to see in real life, like some kind of Lovecraftian monster lurking from one alley to another in the middle of the night.

I mean, if you saw one you wouldn't even know what it was at first, because who would expect such a thing? It'd look like a dark writhing mass more appropriate for the screen of a deep-sea robot than something slinking into a city storm drain. If you saw it scurrying along in the distance would you even *want* to get closer to see what it was? It'd be absolutely terrifying if you were walking back to your apartment after a night out.

As you say, they'd struggle with mobility, meaning that food would be hard to come by. As the weaker rats in the tangled mass die out, the stronger rats would consume them, until you're left with a small group of super-rats attached to each other, each with no regrets about eating their own brothers, and craving more flesh.

At first they would pull on each other, and each wrong move would result in a painful pull of the tail and a yelp. They'd be a wriggling, greasy, throng of rats, twine, and blood, dragging itself painfully from one shadow to the next, emitting screams and shrieks along the way. They'd have no choice but to try and avoid the pain, and that's how they would start learning.

Rats are highly intelligent creatures after all, and it wouldn't take long until the behavioral reinforcement leads to a rather effective superorganism, with each rat taking up its role like some kind of rodential Voltron. They'd get faster and more mobile as they learn to cooperate with each other, because that's the only way they would have survived this long against predators like cats and hawks. There is no way a stray cat could survive against a rat king... it would get swallowed up and devoured, as if by a school of land-piranha.

At that point they'd be much more frightening than a lone rat. You can deal with a lone rat because you can predict how it moves and jumps and what to expect when you see it. You have experience with squirrels and cats and other land mammals, so you'd know when to kick one away and when to jump to the side.

But when an unidentified mass is flinging itself at you from its treetop perch like a pestilential facehugger, do you attack it? Do you dodge it? It's not like you can whack them with a shovel or something because then they'd break apart like an [Asteroids Monster](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidsMonster), and you'd have *two* rat kings to deal with. And you just pissed them off.

But yeah, if you saw one in real life it'd probably make you ""stand there and laugh"", I guess."

"I'm friend-of-a-friend with a lesbian porn star. Her &amp;  her wife are great people, and I've hung out for a couple house parties. 

The second time, I went to use the bathroom, and the previous guest had messily slaughtered a shitbaby in her toilet. Like, it was caked all over the entire bowl and wasn't coming off with multiple flushes. Whoever it was (probably a girl since it was 80% ladies)  HAD to have seen what she'd done, but was clearly some kind of shit terrorist. 

Anyway, I had already had my appetite ruined for the week, but realized it was just gonna stay there and scandalize all her guests until someone dealt with it. I didn't want Ms. Pornstar to be embarrassed, so I bit the bullet, dug out her cleaning supplies and cleaned her toilet for her. Scrubbed out allllll of this other person's shit, and there was a lot of it.

Then I went back to the party and tried to pretend I hadn't just been in shit auschwitz.  I snuck over to her liquor cabinet and took a big slug of her vodka. I'm pretty sure nobody noticed, but even if she caught me, she owes me for keeping that secret. 




Bonus awkwardness: I was vaguely aware that I'd seen her name in porn before meeting her, but didn't recognize her.  After hanging out at that party, I figured I should, uh, research what she actually did.

"TLDR: Smart people act dumb, dumb people act smart.

So according to goodreads, [Einstien stated ""The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know.""](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/620163-the-more-i-learn-the-more-i-realize-how-much) Being the internet, it may be mis-attributed, but none the less it's a very simplistic idea of the Dunning-Kruger effect.

The basic idea is that people who know the most about a subject are likely to be aware of the things they don't know about the subject and in return are more modest about their knowledge, even though they would be considered incredibly skilled or knowledgeable about the subject.  
On the other hand, people who know a fair bit of the subject are likely to be more boastful in their knowledge because they are less likely to be aware of the subtleties of the subject as well as being less aware of the things they don't know.

For example: I've taken some programming classes in the past. If I was asked if I could create a program I'd probably say that ""I could figure out how, given enough time"" (and an internet connection for google searching). Now, if someone actually asked me to create a program, I'd probably be fucked.

On the other hand, my father spent forty years as a plumber. The first question he always asks when someone needs his help is ""where are the instructions."" Seriously, 40 years as a plumber and his first thought is always ""read the instructions."" I've seen this man tear out a toilet, a water heater and all the piping between them, pull out a tape measure order the exact amount of pipe and materials needed. But the last time he was over and saw the sink draining slow, he bought some draino or something and the first thing he did was read the instructions."

So when I was 6, we got no-knock SWAT raided. There had been a robbery in town, and my family's vehicle (as well as a few other factors that I won't name for privacy's sake) matched up. A neighbor called it in to Crime Stoppers, and... it kinda went downhill from there.

So my elder sister and I were in our room playing Super Mario '64 when in busts two officers in full gear. They grabbed us without a word, and carried us downstairs and outside, onto the porch. My mother was out on the lawn, laying prone with several officers around her. My brother was inside with the officers, trying to restrain our dogs (two very pissed off Shar Peis - vicious fuckers).

There was... what I can only describe as a human wall around us. Men with guns and shields directed at us - two scared little girls sitting on the porch. I didn't quite understand what was happening. 

They handed me my other sister, a baby. She was wiggling on my lap and screaming. I asked one of the officers for her bottle and I remember him just staring at me blankly, like it didn't compute that I was even talking to him. I started to cry. 

It wasn't the most frightening thing, to be honest. Maybe because I was a child, and I didn't understand the full implications of having a rifle pointed at me and my house being forcibly searched. In hindsight, it was scary, but at the time it was just... confusing. 

I'm not mad about it, either. From what I recall, the officers were (fairly) civil about it. They were just doing their job and acting on what was good evidence. My dogs were fine, no one was hurt. It was all cleared up by the end of the day.

"This. Since moving to CO I've learned a lot about beer. On one particular brewery tour they made a point to talk about how temperate affects taste. Coldness masks flavor, which is why Coors insists it's the coldest and is meant to be drunk as cold as possible, so you don't have to taste how awful it is. True delicious flavor from a good beer comes out as it warms. Cold is still preferred, but not super cold."

There was a What Not to Wear I saw a long time ago (before Clinton Kelly, when it was the long-haired guy) and the guy they were doing the makeover on kept buying jeans that were WAY too baggy, and the host was like ""look at me, we are the SAME SIZE"" and he took off his pants and made the guy try them on, and sure enough they looked fine. ""It's not about size, it's about FIT."" and he was right. And that was a wakeup call for me. It's okay to wear tighter clothes if they fit correctly."

"By the way, if you ever want to start a cult, this is how/why it works. People *want* to blame their problems on an outside force. Give them a reason. They will come. The more supporters you garner, the easier it will become to gather up more supporters. Once you have about 50 people (a 1-2 year effort minimum) you can start asking for tithing. Start high. 10% and then never move your percentage up from that. At first, it'll be excused as a means afford these Wednesday meetings at your local cafe/church. Then, it'll become a means of providing support to help other grow (but those events will be operated by your minions, so you won't have to actually spend your donations on it).

My Christian church would do this all the time. They'd ask for donations to support their local affairs, but then what would happen? They'd spend $20 on coffee while all of the church members would actually be the ones making food, bringing signs, standing outside for 10 hours, playing *their* instruments. 

So, anyways, you'll exponentially gain traction and cash. You can cash out after 10-15 years and be labeled a fraudulent asshole. Or you can go all in. Start a church. Make it elaborate. Spend tithing money on investments in local businesses. Begin investing in your people's businesses. As your memberships grows, you'll incorporate important citizens. You'll be able to use insider trader trading from business owners to make investments. You can also take their money and launder it tax free as a church. You'll be like their bank. Eventually, you'll be so big you will either have to disappear to an island or you'll be murdered by the next in line. You can never leave though... because now other higher officials will be counting on you to continue the lie so they can profit. You'll be forever tied to this monster you've created. "

"Honestly it's not just the school system, it's every system, everywhere.

Society as a whole is really bad about accepting that mental disorders are more than just autism and maybe depression if you're ""feeling down in the dumps"". Something like 25% of Americans suffer from some form of mental disorder(s), the only reason it's not considered an epidemic is because it can be regarded in small neat boxes like, ""This fractional group has depression"" or ""OCD-inflicted are only a small group"".

Jacki Hillios does a really good job describing, in her TED Talk on addiction, about how people get boiled down by society into these groups and become their diseases, which is incredibly damaging. It's not even people ragging on the diseased, it can also be those congratulating people with a disorder, they put people into these unbreakable boxes so that they can't realize that their disease isn't just them, they're also a person like anyone else."

"Ok so this is probably the biggest mistake of my life. Me and my buddies came up with a game in college called black jack for dares. Basically each player puts about 10 dollars in the pot. Then you played a hand of black jack and the biggest loser had to do a dare from the winner. We were inspired by jackass and silent library so take that as you will. Last man standing gets all the money. 

As you can imagine this type of game can escalate quickly. Especially with around 100 dollars on the line. On one particular night I had made it to the final 3, which was rare. I wanted to eliminate my competition ASAP. I won the hand and was trying to think of the worst dare possible. I remembered that earlier someone had been dared to chug some hot sauce. It was Ghost Pepper sauce and they had refused. So what could be worse than that? What could guarantee that my victim would drop out? Dare him to rub some of that sauce on his dick. 

So I did. I dared him to rub ghost pepper sauce on his dick. And that mad man accepted it. I couldn't believe it. The details were simple, he was to go in the bathroom with a solo cup with some of the sauce in the bottom, place the sauce on his dick, then wait 10 seconds and he could scrub it off. 

Things did not go as planned. I had thought there would be some slight stinging and cursing and then it'd be over. What actually happened would most certainly be banned by the Geneva Convention. My buddy immediately began screaming in pain and we heard water running. No 10 second wait. Then more screaming. Then crying. Then the shower running. Then cursing and whimpering. Then he started begging for milk and a cup. I was chosen to take it to him. 

When I entered the bathroom, water was everywhere and the cup with the sauce had been thrown against the wall. He was in the shower still yelling. When he finally heard me he cussed me out and grabbed the milk out of my hand. He then put it on his dick like an athletic cup and told me he was done with the game and to get the fuck out. 

I went back to the card table and I knew what was about to happen. There were only 2 of us left and the threat of chemical to dick warfare hung heavy in the air. Everyone wanted me to suffer for creating this new punishment. Like the creation of nuclear weapons, I had introduced something to the battle that was vile and hated. In my heart, I knew they were right. I had not thought through the ramifications of the dare and if I lost the hand I would suffer my creation. 

I lost. As I surely should have. The dare was given to me and everyone expected me to drop out. But I didn't. I was going to suffer with my friend and win this money. Then we would split it. It was the only way to cosmically make up for what I did. So I did the dare. I felt the pain of 1,000 suns on my dick and basically had sex with a gallon of milk. Me and my friend spent a long time crying in that bathroom. 

Anyway, I won the dang contest as the final guy had the sense to refuse the pepper dare. I won 110 dollars and gave half of it to the friend I tortured. It wasn't worth it at all. We agreed to ban such dares in the future and my penis still works.

Edit: Thank you very much for the gold! I can honestly say I never saw anything good ever coming from that event. Glad I've been proved wrong."

"I used to be a TA (Teaching Assistant) for a local secondary school. It was money to get me through Uni and pay the bills and to put food in my daughters belly. I ended up working my way up to teaching actual classes not just being the assistant who was there and teaching the class but I was paid for doing what I was already doing! Plus I was in SEN, and everything was amazing and I was happy.

The clincher, I was working at the school where my younger brother was doing his A Levels and my younger sister was doing her GCSE's. I didn't have any direct communications with them other than the odd ""You forgot your lunch you nimwit, here's some money for the cafeteria"". I also had one coworker who would always harass me, mispronounce my name because apparently *I* was the one saying it wrong, no, I know my name, I'm the one whos called it. 

After the last exam season, in about August, my brother got three A's and two B's in his A Levels, got into his dream Uni. My sister ACED her GCSE's, perfection all round. This stupid fucking co-worker who did nothing but talk me down for my sex, intelligence, upbringing, had the audacity to call me out for helping my family cheat. I never went near their exams, their coursework was all done electronically under vigilance (those controlled assessment things) and I had no opportunity to cheat. 

They 'suspended' me, pending an investigation. My brother lost his place at his Uni (he's now at one closer to home and just as happy, but the anger I felt, I spent about four hours angry crying), my sister had to retake every single exam. In January, I got an e-mail offering me my job back, because my sisters and brothers exams came back all clean, apologizing profusely to the damage they'd done, (I'd had no money to pay bills while doing a masters degree AND trying to make sure my daughter was happy and healthy) but it was already too late.

They'd already tarnished my reputation, I couldn't find a job in teaching again with that hanging over me. I told them very kindly to fuck themselves and took a job which pays much more, not in teaching. I'm sad I don't get to do what I've longed to do since I was younger (teaching young children), but I know I'm much happier out of it all.

Yeah, that was my fuck it, I'm so done with your bullshit moment. "

A 6 year old girl went missing. Search teams couldn't find the girl, all leads ended up nowhere. Eventually after 2-3weeks of the girl being missing, they find her (dead) body in the trunk of a parked car in a random parking lot. He said that in the 'missing persons business' this is good news, because bad news is better than no news. After finding the body they drove to the parents home. 

He said that when you drive up onto the driveway and are about to open the car door, you realise that 10seconds later you are going to knock on their door, and 10seconds after that they are going to open that door and you are going to 'destroy those parents lives'.

"Getting ready to head out to boot camp I see. You're going about this the right way, you should be getting information from as many sources as possible. 

USCG here, I get a lot of people who ask me which boot camp is the most difficult, I don't have a good answer because I've only been through Coast Guard boot camp. So as far as what can you expect? I couldn't tell you. 

Boot camp is designed to both acclimate you to stress and to see how you react under pressure. If you're going to just freeze up or be unable to handle it they want to be able to find that out under controlled conditions. You will get screamed at, if you really think about it being yelled at isn't that bad. In reality though they're really good at it. I think the reason why it's so stressful is that there are these people in the way of something that you want, and they have the ability to take it away from you. You get in trouble for EVERYTHING. I got in trouble once for not having enough pens in my pocket- why didn't I have enough pens in my pocket? I was doing push ups (that's what you do in boot camp) and I had my pen and notebook on the ground in front of me. My CC is walking past me, and steps real slowly on my pen so that it breaks really slow. He raised a hand over his mouth as if to say ""Did I do that?""  Not two minutes later I'm doing push ups again and a performance tracker for not having enough pens!

A lot of people find out they can't handle it when they get to boot camp. So as far as what can you do to prepare? Listen to your recruiter. Be able to do the minimum standards for fitness push ups, sit ups, running. You didn't mention which branch, and the CG is the only one that does this, but if you fail your first PT test in boot camp they will kick you out. Memorize your eleven general orders. This one is true for all branches, the wording varies from branch to branch, know them verbatim. Eleven to one, one to eleven, each one individually. Know the phonetic alphabet, it's the same for all the services but different than what police use. Learn 24 hour time, set your phone to it ahead of time is the easiest way to do it. Bring what you're supposed to bring, don't bring any contraband. Anything that you can't have with you (civvies, cell phone until you can have it) gets locked up. 

Other than that, I'm not a bad ass by any stretch of the imagination and I made it through boot camp. Listen to instructions, sometimes they sound weird. In our boot camp you talk to people like how you would talk on a radio (to teach you how to talk on a radio) and when I was told that at first I was completely baffled. It made no sense to me. Don't do anything stupid. If you're told not to do something just don't do it. It is 100% easier to not do something than it is to do something. 

Most importantly don't quit. They didn't let you quit when I went through, now apparently they will, but there's a caveat. They keep you there for all of boot camp (outside of your company and CCs) and make you watch the graduation ceremony that you would have been a part of. Also then we can't work with you again, the only way we can process you again for boot camp is if you fail your PT. If you quit you're done for ever. So please please make sure this is something that you really want. Boot camp sucks and there are real world consequences for quitting, it's doable but you have to really want it. Hopefully I wasn't too much of a downer for you. Good luck!"

"Reference to lane-styled MOBA games. League of Legends and Dota 2 are the current 2 most popular lane MOBA games, where the map is split into a ""top"" lane, a ""mid"" lane, a ""bottom"" lane, and the interlane ""jungle"". Games are played in a 5v5 format usually, with 2 players (a support and a 'sweeper') in the bottom lane, 1 anti-player assassin (a ""ganker) in the middle lane, 1 supporting/defensive player in the top lane, and a farmer/scout for the jungle.

""Ganking mid"" is referring to assassinating/""ganking"" another player in the middle lane, occasionally by teaming up on them."

I had a woman who hadn't worked in years, I was expecting her to be in some kind of slummy shack. Nope. Her townhouse was section 8, but it was still nicer than mine. She had a huge leather sectional, a 55-inch TV back when those weren't common, a nice car in the garage, and her kids were playing Xbox and had on Jordans. Then during the initial discussion she complained about not getting enough food stamps and wanted to work just enough hours to get paid for the job while still getting benefits. 


Meanwhile, working 40+ hours a week, I was sharing a bedroom with my 9-year-old sister and driving a beater that was willed to me.

UPDATE: Getting a lot of understandabl vitriol for this comment. A lot of ""walk a mile in their shoes"" comments. That is very fair. And I have. I've lived in motels, in vans, in a warehouse lobby when we couldn't afford rent. Note that I should have added that this person was making zero effort to actually find work; not showing up to interviews, not returning calls, or on the rare occasion I got her a job she would not show up. I understand the importance of benefits for the less fortunate, however, I will never, ever, EVER think it is appropriate to constantly take while giving absolutely nothing back."

"In order for a scam to work, you need to find out what someone values more than their money, make them believe you have it, and then offer to sell it to them. 

(The ""Nigerian"" scam is predominant in pop culture, but there are plenty of mass email scams as well that prey on those who are religious or charitable instead of just greedy).

The main places this breaks down are when someone knows not to trust sketchy emails from people claiming to have their hearts' desire, or doesn't value what the scammer is offering, or is just plain loss-averse when it comes to money (""cheap""). Most people have at least one of these with the mass-email versions of the scams (as they are *very* poorly targeted), so not a lot of people actually fall for them these days. The few people who do tend to fall pretty hard, and sending out massive volumes of email isn't terribly pricey in comparison, which is why you still see these in your spam folder from time to time.

Edited to add: The above refers to mass-volume email scams, like the old ""nigerian prince"" stuff I mentioned. I realize looking at the above post that it never actually specifies this; my bad for jumping to conclusions."
"Pay attention to the traffic both current and future.  I currently live on a double dead end.  My last house was on a triple dead end.  That went from being a happy accident to a requirement for us.

1-we have no thru traffic.  There are 10 houses on our cul de sac.  There are maybe 20 more on the two cul de sacs past us.  That means very few cars go by our house

2-if you don't live here, you don't belong here and we are going to notice right away.  Criminals don't like committing crimes on dead end streets because escape is harder.

Pay attention to future traffic too.  Current and last houses both were in areas that were completely built out and there was no physical way to expand the number of houses.  That meant the traffic we saw was the absolute worst it could possibly be.  

If you are buying a house in a new development and it has an HOA ask if the fee you are being quoted is based on current build or build out.  We were looking at a new house in a really nice location with a ton of positives.  Our awesome realtor asked about the HOA fee and it was based on build out.  The development was 1/3 built and the HOA was $200 a month.  That meant we could potentially be hit with a $600+ HOA bill if built out didn't happen.  Four years later build out had not happened.  

Window treatments (blinds, curtains, etc) are expensive.  $30 for a set of blinds might not seem bad until you realize you have 22 windows to cover.  Oh and measure each window and shop with in inventory or you will be sorry.

If you are buying an existing home the following are critical:

Foundation. It's the ....foundation.  If it is bad, the house is bad.  Don't buy a house with a bad foundation.

Roof. A simple reroof will cost you $10k. A complex once can hit $30k.  Know what you are buying.

HVAC. I'm in the process of replacing mine now.  $7k for a simple replacement.  

Water heater.  If you have doubts, replace it.  It cost me $800 to replace my water heater.  Mitigation from it failing cost $1200 and it only flooded for a few minutes.  It's easy to have a $30k mitigation bill.  

Windows.  Windows can cost $1500 each to replace.  I have 22 Windows in my current house.  Do the math.  We got in a fight over Windows at closing and we're ready to walk over it.  

Pay attention to what you home inspection report says.  Either get the seller to fix it or get money to do it yourself."

I don't get quite so anxious at night anymore, and the night terrors have totally disappeared. In fact more often than not, my dreams are blissful and my sleep is restful. But regardless, it's a bit of a phobic relationship. Especially if I've been having a really anxious/depressive period, the fears of sleep and rest always flare back up. And the last few years have been a bit harsh so, that's the whole story I suppose."

"**TL;DR** *Stores don't want your merchandise, they want money. Sell your stuff on the internet*

People selling things to retail stores are taking a hit on what they get so they get the cash NOW, and I don't understand why people complain about it.

Let's say I have a Glock 19 I bought for $550. Popular pistol, reliable, hard to mess up, will run for ever. I can sell it used for $400 every day, might get $450 if I wait and $500 if the market is tight at the moment. LGS has a Glock 43 for $625 that I'd like to trade up for.

Now, the LGS doesn't want your gun, they want your cash money because they got bills to pay and vacation they're saving for. You'll be lucky if the LGS pays you $400 for your basically NiB Glock 19 because, and here's the key, they are incurring all the time and effort it'll take to turn that pistol into money. They are more likely to offer you $250 and price it at $400 to get that quick turnaround because they have something YOU want and you are offering something that only has a value in the future.

You're basically getting a cash advance on a consignment sale.

"A few years ago, I committed myself into a mental health hospital for being suicidal.

In retrospect, I kinda doubt I would've killed myself had I not checked myself in. But it was one of those best decisions I've ever made in my life nonetheless. They got me on enough drugs to take care of depression (or put a dent in it - depression is like a cancer that never really goes away) and pull me away from a descent into alcoholism (I definitely wasn't at the ""alcoholic"" point, but was WELL on my way, and I've got family history).

After around 10 days in near isolation, they discharged me with a recommendation for group therapy, which I also went through.

Group therapy was, by several orders of magnitude, the most valuable life experience I've been through. People at work, friends, etc. all describe me as an incredibly chill person, laid back. Can't for the life of them understand how I can be so unbothered by something or another. Months of therapy, that's how. (And some other life shit).

Fast forward to today. I've held a job down for longer than any other job I've ever had. My income is near the 6-figure range. I live by myself, and eat out every night. I genuinely enjoy waking up and going to work in the mornings. I'm totally okay with being single and unwilling to mingle.

My life advice could be boiled down to two things:

1. Persist

2. Get the fuck over your pride and ask for help. Even if you don't need it. If you could benefit from it, ask for help."

"In one of our many fights she tried to leave in MY vehicle and stormed outside. I had my keys on me so when she walked out i locked the door to get her to have her mom come get her. She turned her wedding ring around and while staring at me through the back sliding glass door, this bitch proceeds to use a diamond to fucking marr her face neck and arm, while saying ""youre gonna go to fucking jail! Look at these scratches, you fucking did this to me! Let me in or ill call the police!""

Now i dont know about you, but if a woman is in a certain state of mind that she will use the hardest natural substance known to scratch her own body up, im not letting her in.

So she called the cops and i had to explain to them that i did not in fact attack her and if they would care to notice that out of all her scratches she had none on her left arm.(for the uninformed, here in merica we wear our wedding rings on that hand) then they had an ""ah ha"" moment so big i thought i was in the fucking take on me video. They finally saw the fuckery at play and hauled her off. Any way that was our second time being married.... thats my crazy ex story.

She kept and reused containers (including hamburger meat containers), ziploc bags, plastic wear, etc. She married my grandfather and they ended up being fairly well off, to the point of having over a million in a savings account (on top of other assets) when she passed 5 years after my grandpa. We didn't know the extent of her container hoarding until Gramps died and she had dementia, so the family decided to sell the house. The house always looked spotless, but apparently she boarded these containers in cabinets no one ever looked in. 

She also had a freezer in the basement that was always full, so sometime in the early 2000s, my two older cousins offered to help her clean it out. They pulled out things with labels on it that said ""Good Spaghetti - 1995"". She tried to tell them to brush the ice crystals off and it would be fine. They named the freezer 'The Tundra' after that. "

There is and NASA will not release it. They have confirmed that 02 system was manually activated and that some control inputs were given after explosion by pilot to try and take control.

"I always thought the whole portkey thing was such a convoluted plot, anyway. The whole point was that Voldemort needed his blood, right? 

He could've just ordered Draco Malfoy (through Lucius) to harm Harry, or something. Similar to what Malfoy did anyway in the beginning of the sixth book, on the train (where he broke Harry's nose). Then just collect a sample of blood and take it to Voldemort. Malfoy maybe would've spent some time in detention for hurting Harry and Voldemort returns without even alerting Harry to that fact.

But I guess then Voldemort couldn't have his dramatic graveyard comeback while his enemy is tied to a tombstone. Which is more important than subtlety and discretion, I'm sure. Not hating on Rowling, though, I still read those books every year."

Basically a stranger in a strange home where everyone went to sleep. I basically watched TV alone until it was just infomercials. Then I played mortal kombat until I was so fucking sick of how repetitive it got. Basically at that point I started crying and I had to wake someone up telling them I wanted to go home. But they didn't know where my sister was and this was before cellphones so they didn't know how to reach her. 

So I was just stuck there with infomercials and mk3 regardless. Fucking awful night. I couldn't even just sleep on the couch cause I was so confused with my situation. Surrounded by adults who didn't care about me. I was so angry with my sister but when she came back she acted like it was no big deal.

A customer came in to drop off their deposit and we were making small talk.  How are you?  How are the kids?  That kinda stuff.

We did not see him for over a week and then another employee dropped off their deposit.  We asked how Jim was.  Turns out Jim had extremely aggressive cancer that was throughout his entire body and died three days after going to the doctor's.  It has been years and I still can't believe it.  
He was a bit annoying but I didn't hate him. Personally I didn't think he was as bad as everyone said. I think it helps that he has lesser roles in II and III.

It started with Felicity being unreasonable about Oliver's son (Flash crossover episode), being miraculously cured from paralysis, killing off the Black Canary, way too much Smoak family drama, the villain's storyline falling apart (Dahrk seemed intimidating at first but towards the end of the season it seemed that not even the writers knew where this story was supposed to go), the infamous Cupid episode etc.

Being a producer is probably time-consuming, especially on a brand-new show. So the day-to-day business on Arrow was most likely handled by Mericle. I can almost hear their discussions behind the scenes.

WM: ""Hey Marc, the whole wheelchair thing didn't really work. Let's let Felicity walk again""

MG: ""That wheelchair idea was pretty good tho. Does none of the writers have an idea what to do with it? I'm kinda busy with Legends right now""

WM: ""no good ideas here, sorry. Let her walk again?""

MG: ""Well yeah, I guess so""

WM: ""k, bye""

I do this in real life too. When my boss is busy I just prepare some suggestions for decisions (worded in a way that suit my intentions) and pass them to her. Most of the time she'll just give her ok because she's to busy coming up with own ideas.

tl;dr - Mericle should be fired. Guggenheim may not be the best producer ever but I firmly believe reddit's anger is directed towards the wrong person.

"I worked at a financial custodian firm, right in the middle of the financial district, big office tower, suit and tie, the whole shmear. I was on a team of 15, processing stock sell/buy orders. 

By the end of the year the company had reduced my team of 15 to a team of 5, with the same workload. We were pulling crazy overtime just to keep on top of it all, but were all getting pretty burnt out. We were being hounded by management to do more, faster, etc.

We had a team meeting with our manager who laid out the executives demand that we do even *more*, and honest to god, we all just started *laughing*. Not a giggle or snort, full on belly laughing at the insanity of their request.

My manager was furious, asking us what the fuck we thought was so funny, and I just bluntly told him ""It's impossible, we've been working ourselves to the bone for a year, 5 people doing the work of 15 and now they want more? We physically can't!""

It was like this weird stress wall just broke, and we gave up.  I walked out 2 days later having snagged a job with their competitor.  When they asked me why I wanted to leave my current job, i told them it was a toxic atmosphere and utterly disorganized and a waste of my team's talents.

"I used to have a friend who was a little chubby. For reference, I have always been skinny like a stick, it's just the way I grew. Anyway, we're probably about nine or ten at this point. 

I'm staying at her place overnight, and they're one of those families that all sit down together and eat dinner. I'm incredibly picky at this point in my life, I would rather not eat than have something ""gross"". After haggling with her mom for as long as I could without being rude, we agreed that I would eat a can of cream of potato soup she found in the back of her cupboard, while the rest of the family would eat their normal food. 

I'm not a huge fan of the cream of potato soup, honestly, so I'm just toughing it out, taking one tiny sip at a time while the rest of them load up on kimchi, noodles, and other foods. The dinner conversation is nonexistent and I try not to make slurping noises with my spoon. Then, my friend goes to grab some more kimchi for herself. 

""Why are you so fat?"" Her mother snaps. ""You're like a whale. Always going for seconds.""

Her stepdad joins in now- ""SO fat. It's disgusting. Don't you know how to control your portions?""

Her mom then says ""Why can't you be more like mr_trick? Mr_trick is skinny and pretty. If you stopped eating so much you would be like her.""

At this point my friend is crying and this somehow angers her parents more, there's rapid-fire Korean being yelled across the table, and I'm just sitting there with my soup, not speaking.

Was definitely intensely awkward. "

"The wage gap. It's an average of the salaries of all men and all women who are able to work and therefore doesn't adjust for the tendency of women to work less due to maternity leave, willingly staying at home to raise children, and choosing less lucrative career paths in college.

He was always very reliable so when he didn't show up as usual we tried to contact his family. He wasn't married and had no kids. The only person on his contact card was a fairly distant relative. After not receiving a call back on his third day of absence we called the police to do a welfare check. Apparently he had gone home the day of his last shift and committed suicide. It was really awful but at the same time a bit touching to see hundreds of our employees attend the funeral. Even four years later there is still a memorial up at the branch for him. Wish he could have seen how much of an impact he had.

"It goes much deeper! The jumper who was attempting to commit suicide was the son of the man inside the apartment who fired the gun (aimed at his nagging wife BTW). The father had a habit of waving his gun around (which was never loaded) when he and his wife were fighting. The son was so stressed and depressed that he secretly loaded his father's gun with the hopes that he would accidentally shoot the kids mother and therefore go to prison and this would free him from his problems (dad=jail &amp; mom=dead) So when his plan failed, the son decided to just kill himself by jumping off the roof of the high rise apartments. NOW, this is when the son jumps, the father fires the loaded gun, the bullet misses the mother but exits the apartment through a window as the son is passing by and fatally HITS him. Here is where it gets crazy. The detective declared the case as a suicide, NOT a murder. In this case, The person responsible for the dead victim is NOT the person who fired the gun but the person who loaded the gun (they had the intent to kill). So the suspect charged with murder is the SON. And the victim on the receiving end of the bullet is... the SON. This means that the son indeed killed himself which is why the case was ruled a suicide! (The father was not charged with murder) WTF!"

My mom bought him a whole bunch of gym clothes and some jeans that fit, and she told me that she saw a Nike bag for sale at the store too. We're middle class, used to be very poor, but when she saw the bag she knew he would love it and she should get it for him. So she loaded all the clothes up in the bag, and dropped it by his house, telling his proud parents that it was some stuff someone left at church. My mom is so sweet, I love her to death. "

Also there was never a obvious villian introduced that was causing all of the problems to the protagonists.. which is odd for a childrens movie because kids like their movies white and black. so thats why i was expecting Bing Bong to reveal himself to be the bad guy at some point and why it so hard that in the end all he wanted was Rileys happiness and no amount of time spent forgotten had changed that.

"I'm in nursing/mental health. 
Some of the more memorable things I saw were during my student placements many years ago. For instance, one old guy I visited was a bit odd... As he was talking I was scanning the room and see these framed photos of him from decades ago... He was in full black face in them! Why he proudly displayed these photos I don't know....
Also, as a student, I encountered what I believe was a case of (spousal)  Münchausen by Proxy.  The client was bed bound and had been for decades following a vehicle accident. She was skin and bones, couldn't communicate, and had some type of fungal infection covering her skin. The husband would watch her like a hawk and didn't leave the nurse and I alone with her for a moment... Very controlling. Yet played up the 'carer' role... It just didn't seem genuine, and I suspect he was getting secondary gains from the years of sympathy in his role, hence my belief it was a case of MBP. There was also some other guy living in the house who just stood around and watched us like a creep. When we got in the car after the visit both the nurse and I agreed it was extremely disturbing.

Seriously though, there's zero information on condoms to allow you to compare them. No indication of their size, tightness, elasticity, thickness, shape, anything like that. Best I've ever seen is a picture of one unrolled on the back of a box of Trojans. But even so, I had a hell of a time figuring out the difference between Trojan ""thintensity"" and Trojan ""bare skin"". Both claim to be thinner (than what, I don't know). Now try comparing across brands.

"&gt; America is a big country (but so are Australia and Europe as a whole, and they're everywhere).

Australia's population mostly lives on the edges of the continent, and despite it being a large nation - the population is fairly concentrated in a few areas.

Europe has a much better airline system - more competition, lower prices means it's easier to get around. Until 1978, the US had a system where the government forced airlines to offer service to even unprofitable areas, so rural communities would be given equal access to air services. This resulted in a mess of air travel in the US - prices are higher than they should be if it was purely capitalistic for many travelers.

There's a reason that the middle of the USA is termed ""flyover states"" - flights from the west and east coasts are relatively cheap, whereas middle of the country things are very expensive. From San Francisco, I can fly to Hawaii for $450, or London for $640, or Rome for $715. If I was in Kansas City, it'd be $765 for Hawaii, $880 for London and $830 for Rome. Even just KC to SF is $240.

To compare, from London to Rome is $61, to Berlin is $52, to Istanbul is $67. So much cheaper.

&gt; American paid leave is shit, and exorbitant student loans are due as soon as you graduate.

Yes.

&gt; Media representations of other countries are negative, incorrect or non-existant. For example, America rarely shows British TV programs - they remake them so they're ""understandable"".

The good news is that this is changing a lot for younger people. Cable TV/internet streaming television has really improved access to lots of UK content in particular. We just need to get QI showing regularly here!

&gt; Because comparatively few people travel, there are misunderstandings about the effort and expense involved.

I'd like you to expand on this a bit. I've travelled in Europe a few times, and would love to go more, but it's always been pricey - with exchange rates and flight costs, things add up really quickly. If there's some secret way to save money, please let us know!

&gt; I may be wrong but all of the above above leads to an insular viewpoint, and little curiousity about the world, which just reinforces the cycle.

This I would say is somewhat true. Even traveling *within* the US is somewhat rare. I like to travel as my vacation budget allows, and I've only been to about 30 of our 50 states, let alone many cities within them."

I had to deal with it with family. My mother-in-law actually bent down and *kissed* my belly and felt free to touch it whenever she wanted; she never asked me. It put ME in an awkward spot because I didn't want to kick up a shit storm. I had told my family I didn't want to be touched, and they respected it. 

Strangers, though? It's just so...wtf.


My bigger problem now is having people touch my kid. He's a friendly, redheaded, blue-eyed Gerber-lookin' 18-month-old. I've been at a restaurant and had people stop, touch his face, pat his head, try to hug him (?!?!), touch his hands, etc. It's gotten to the extent that if we go out, I will sit so that I'm blocking him into a corner -- they would have to get past me to get to my son, which has helped.

But it shouldn't have to be that way. Pregnant women and mothers with young kids shouldn't have to worry about strangers coming up and touching them."

"Story time.

When my mom was in her twenties (before she ever thought of getting married) she got invited to be a brides maid at a friend's wedding, well on the way to the reception, she was the last one out of the limo and she was a bit tipsy off champaign... She walked into what she THOUGHT was the bride and groom's home...

There was a family eating dinner. They pointed to the window and said: ""Party's next door.""

She was SO embarrassed but so glad it hadn't turned out bad."
"I read ""8 thick ass hairs"" and was really confused."
"I asked my friend, who we'll call Tom, to watch my family's three dogs while we went out of town to visit family. We were letting him stay in the house so it would be easier. I wrote detailed instructions about how much to feed them, etc. There was not enough dog food to get them through the week we would be gone, but my mom told him to just buy more when necessary and that she'd pay him back when we got back. He agreed. Everything seemed like it would be fine. It wasn't. 

I would text him and ask how the dogs were doing and he always said everything was fine. I believed him. He had been a good friend and I had no reason to doubt him. As the trip came to a close, I was feeling more and more nervous. The day we were coming home, I let him know we were on our way and he was quick to ask where we were. Yes, it seems like an innocent question, but something didn't feel right. 

When we got home, the house was a complete disaster and smelled horrible. Once we sent him home, we realized a few things (well, we realized this first one before he left, but I was too angry to confront him in a sane way). The first thing we realized was that the bag of dog food in the garage was the same food that was there when we left. There was very little, if any actually missing. The fucker either barely fed my dogs or didn't feed them at all. My dachshund definitely looked like she had lost weight (enough to see her ribs). And when we were getting ready to go to bed, my mom figured out he must have slept in her bed. The jizz was a dead giveaway. I knew he hadn't gotten any in a long time and there were no prospects, so I was able to deduce that he thought masturbating in my mom's bed was somehow a good idea. 

I never spoke to him again. It's been almost three years and I'm still pissed and would love to tell him off for starving my dogs for a week. Guess he was too busy jizzing in my mom's bed to worry about the living creatures we trusted him to take care of. Fuck him. "

"Worked at a popular restaurant on Mother's day (busiest day of the year) a few years ago. Normally, the sous opens the place, and deals with all the prep issues before the exec pops in right before service.


The night before; the sous, and the baker all went out and got way too fucked up. The morning of; me, our dishwashers, and our salad guy wound up waiting for an hour to a locked kitchen. Once the two stumbled in an hour into my precious prep time. They decided to bail again to go check out a car show nearby. Leaving me and the salad guy to prep for a horde of half drunk mothers for brunch (Bottomless Mimosa's everywhere...Everywhere).



After hauling some serious ass, mental breakdowns, and yelling at some very understanding dishwashers; we somehow managed to get back on track. Until the FoH manager finally shows up and says that we're opening an hour early. A major Fuck me moment, but whatever. We have 30 minutes to finish prep for a completely booked mother's day brunch and an onslaught of walk ins. Around this time the 2 hungover dudes decided it was finally time to work...after their cig break though. 



Exec and pm sous show up to help prep, thinking that we're still opening at the normal time. The have a tiny freak out moment, and then gets balls deep in the weeds with me and the salad guy to help get things back on track. We manage to get somewhat where we were supposed to be at service. 


We get completely destroyed during service. I get a bit of heat stroke in the process. We start running out of everything. Around this time the exec's boss, the certified exec, shows up to see how we're fairing. He see's me, and asks what I need. I give him a list, and he goes quiet and goes to work in the back. We managed to get through service with 4 guys on the line (normally 2), the salad guy ( who's in no better shape than I am at this point). We're completely wrecked. The line looks like a warzone, we're cut up, burnt, and defeated. As we're cleaning the Cert Exec comes into the kitchen as tells me and salad guy to not leave, as he wanted to talk to us outside...Alone.


Again. We're already defeated mentally; nothing can really phase us at this point. Or so we thought.

Cert exec pulls me outside where the now awake sous is waiting for us...The exec lays into me about not being prepared, lacking certain items from my prep list, not making enough of certain items, yelling at me (in the parking lot) about time management and responsibility. When the fucking certified executive chef (Who showed up an hour after our service started) then looks at the sous then me and says, ""The Sous told me that you were late this morning, and that you've been sluggish all day...that is no excuse. if it happens again you're fired.""


The same sous who showed up an hour late; drunk, high, and half passed out. Let alone left us mid prep to go check out some shitty car show. 


I gave the sous, who've I've covered for before, with the biggest ""Et tu, brute?"" look ever. I looked at the exec. I laughed. and gave them my notice. I walked back in to the normal exec and the pm sous and told them what happened...They weren't happy, but the pm sous bought me and the salad guy a drink, a pat on the back and told us we did the best we could. We did close too 1000 covers in a ~100 seat place in 6 hours in a 3 man kitchen (with 4 guys on the line this day.)


TL;DR; It was a shit day, and my boss threw me under the bus of busses."

"God I hate this one chick so much. We'll call her Cuntnose. 

We are at a tech school taking classes for Computer networking. So pretty much lots of network stuff. NOT learning how to build and fix PC's. Well Cuntnose prides herself on being a legit gamer chick that built her own computer. During our one hardware class where we do talk about computers, she tries to insert all of her ""knowledge"" about her PC. No one cares. Half the students have some elaborate rig and you don't hear them talking about it all the time. Also, her knowledge apparently covers the smallest range imaginable. When we would do a lab she'd complain the whole time how the computers we were using weren't like the ones she was used to. ""I've never worked on a Dell. That's why I'm having trouble. HAHAHAHA.""

Cuntnose's complaints didn't end there. Every class she'd sigh heavily when we were moving on and she didn't understand something. Then she'd say stuff like, ""Doesn't matter."" ""I'm failing anyway."" Etc.

When the semester started to come to a close she stopped showing up. The days she did show up, she'd just complain about how screwed she was. she came on the very last day crying and asking for extensions. The instructors thankful didn't give a shit since she skipped class the last two weeks. 

I could literally go on forever complaining about specific shit Cuntnose did, but I'll just leave it there."

"Oh man. I just recalled something. I was going to drop my SO home after our tuition classes. There was a dark alley next to the road I was driving my scooter on. At that time, I was very much into bird watching and my SO got interested too. So, it was at around 7 in the evening and there was enough light to see what was there in the alley. My SO saw a peacock fly into the alley and told me to stop as she wanted to observe it. We park my scooter and start walking into it.


In about 20 seconds or so, a police van rushes there from nowhere and stop us. They detain us and take our details and say that this alley is used by teenagers to have sex in the open. They accused us of the same and said that they are lodging an official complaint against us for improper public behavior. Apparently, it was so common in the alley that almost everyone here thought of it like that. Somehow we didn't know that and the police officer just wouldn't believe that all my SO wanted to see was a freaking peacock, and not my cock!

"It goes even deeper. There are some areas where people will consider backchanneling (saying ""really"", ""no way"", ""right"", etc.) rude. In other places, *not* saying it is rude.

Not to mention, conversation in general is very culturally mediated. [This](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5523ffe4e4b012b2c4ebd8fc/t/56ddaf3fab48defc357acdf0/1457368895228/Tannen-NewYorkJewishConversationalStyle.pdf) is an article by Deborah Tannen on New York (Jewish) English -- if a speaker of New York (Jewish) English is having a conversation with another NYJ speaker, they're likely to, for example, tell stories in rounds -- i.e., when one stops their story, another starts up with their own without directly engaging in the first story. This seems rude to some people not familiar with the conversation style, because it seems like the second speaker is ignoring the first. In reality, the second speaker is engaging the first by offering a story related in theme, message, or content to the first, even if they never explicitly draw those connections. For a speaker of NYJE, it can feel weird if someone just focuses on your story and then moves on to another -- it can feel inorganic and stilted. 

Another issue is the difference in speech rate, acceptable pause times, and acceptable expressions of interest:

&gt;Perhaps the most easily perceived and characteristic feature of this style is the fast rate of speech and tendency to overlap (speak simultaneously) and latch (Sacks' term for allowing no pause before turntaking). [...] overlap is used cooperatively by the New Yorkers, as a way of showing enthusiasm and interest, but is interpreted by non-New Yorkers as just the opposite: evidence of lack of attention. (137)

Tannen goes on to show how this causes problems, because of two conflicting sets of cultural norms. It's very important to note that neither is wrong -- both groups of speakers have their own norms, practices, and expectations; both groups' norms are just as arbitrary; and it seems just as rude and off putting to one that the norms are being violated as it is to the other. For example, take John, a New Yorker, and Greg, a Kansan. If John says something while Greg is talking and Greg stops, Greg will see John as having rudely interrupted him. But in reality, the interruption was *mutually created* out of the *mismatch* in cultural norms -- if John were speaking to Fred the New Yorker, Fred would've plowed right along, because John's interruption was an example of cooperative conversation, not of stealing the stage. Thus, ""[t]he 'interruption' may actually be the creation of the interlocutor who stopped when s/he was expected to continue talking over the overlap"" (145).

It's like -- you know how in some cultures, it's rude to leave food on your plate because leaving food on it would signal that you didn't enjoy it / don't appreciate the value of the food being given? And in others, you're supposed to leave a little food because otherwise it signals that you haven't received enough food? Imagine if the former was at the latter's for dinner. They'd keep clearing their plate (because it's rude not to), and the host would keep filling it (thinking they were still hungry). The guest would feel like the host was imposing far too much food on them, because there is likely (to him) an accepted way to signal that you want more food...and he isn't doing that. Likewise, the host probably feels like the guest is rudely eating him out of house and home, because there's an accepted way to indicate that you're full...and the guest isn't doing that. So they end up in this destructive cycle of trying to fix the problem in a way that really exacerbates it. 

This is *exactly* what happens when someone who speaks a dialect of English that encourages latching and overlap talks with someone who speaks a dialect of English with longer pauses and no accepted room for latching and overlap. The one ""interrupts"" (really, latches or employs cooperative overlap) in order to signal that they're an active listener, and the other pauses to let the other speak rather than plowing through. Then, instinctively sensing the awkward pause and wanting to maintain rapport, the first begins speaking again -- which the other instinctively takes as a signal to *stop* speaking, rather than being encouraged to start up again. It's instinctual, and there's no real way to change it other than for *both* sides to recognize the issue and give the other a little leeway."

She then said her problem was the test... she would do much better with an *oral* exam.  Couldn't he just give her an *oral* exam?  This was proposed several times.  

He finally had enough, told her to leave and if she said another word he'd report her to the Dean of Students.

"5th grade, we're learning division. It's the easy stuff like 3 into 18. Single digit into double digit. I'd learned it early thanks to my grandad so I had an easy time with it and could do it in my head. All my classwork/homework had ""show more work :)"" on it but was otherwise correct. 

Test day on division comes and goes easy peasy. Next day, during the class with everyone present, the teacher calls out my score (not 100% but high 90s IIRC) and then states that I cheated. Humilated, I get all huffy-puffy and tell her I did no such thing. She then calls me a liar in front of all my friends and peers.

I tell her I'm not and then she tells me to prove it then and writes a simple division problem on the bored and I answer no problem. She writes like another 3 and I answer, no problemo. So she writes a one number over three numbers now. It takes longer but I got it and God was I happy. Then she does two numbers over three numbers. It took a moment and I scribbled down the numbers as I was figuring it out, just the numbers in the answer, not the work, and she says that's cheating and takes my paper/pencil away and writes a new problem. It took awhile but I got it right. 

Then it goes into three digits over four digits. Somehow, I got that one right. The next one I couldn't figure out in my head and when I said I couldn't without paper to help see it, the teacher screams, ""Ha! This proves you lied and cheated!"" And she marked a huge X over my test with everyone watching and told the kids this is what happens when you cheat and lie about it.

I cried in front of the whole class and my friends then kinda pushed me out the group after that and I just lost all interest in schooling. Went from A honour roll to having to repeat the grade just from lack of care and effort. Still salty over it too! Wtf type of person does that to a 5th gradet?!"

I took a giant hunting knife and stuck a note in their door. ""When we have kids you are forbidden from seeing them, they won't even know you exist. If you come near my family, I will physically remove you. Come near my wife and you better bring this knife."" 

My family ADORES my wife, and the ceremony was on my Grandparents farm, my mom used to be a wedding planner. My other grandmother gave me the last hand made quilt she would ever make. We had an amazing time with my rather large family.

And when that day comes I just know they will complain about the unfair burden. 

Added hilarity. For a brief period of time I worked for a woman who claimed to be a master at ""playing the tax game."" What this turned out to mean was that she would do things like pay her employees bills instead of paying them wages and intimidate them into accepting a lack of pay stubs. She also demanded all fuel receipts, claiming employees would be compensated for travel, but instead feigned ignorance and tried to claim all the fuel as personal business expenses. 

My favorite though, and I didn't find out until later, was that from day one she had been trying to trick me into saying I was an independent contractor. She seemed to be of the belief that this was a magic incantation that would allow her to sue me for the return of any wages paid if I were to ever quit. I know this because when I quit she threatened to sue me for every penny I had been paid due to my ""independent status"". This in spite of my offer letter, pay stubs, and her referring to me as an employee in every email exchange we had.

"&gt;It's always incredible to me when vendors fail to keep 1000% profit margin items in stock. My grocery store sells little stickers that you stick to kraft paper lawn bags so that the garbage man will pick up your lawn waste. The stickers are $3.50 EACH, and each one is about the dimensions of half a normal 12"" ruler. I cannot imagine how many you can fit in a single box, but probably thousands. A single pallet of these stickers would probably be enough to last multiple years, and yet, they are constantly out of them. 

I think you are incorrect in assuming that those stickers are a high profit margin item.

You're assuming profit = $3.50 - [negligible cost of manufacturing sticker]. That's not what is happening. Those stickers are basically user fees for use of the yard waste disposal infrastructure for that community. You aren't paying for the sticker, you're paying for the services provided and that sticker is a proof of payment. The grocery store is not providing those services, it is just making the sticker available. They are probably close to breaking even on sale and they may not even have that much control over the supply.

My community has a similar system in that you have to buy and use specially colored bags for trash, recycle, and yard waste. The bags are several orders of magnitude more expensive than regular retail bags, because they are a user fee for trash services. You can get them directly from the trash department, but local supermarkets also sell them *at cost* because it's more convenient than going down to a government building and it's another reason to get you into their store where you will likely buy other stuff. They do not make a profit off the sale of these items."

He didn't notice my dad in the garden one day, and shit went down.  I think my dad threatened him, and the guy left us alone after that.

My parents didn't seem too shocked to learn that the stepdaughter was pregnant.  Social services seemed absolutely oblivious, and the police didn't investigate.  We generally kept our distance, except for the time my parents gave the girl some of my old baby clothes.  When she was 18, she confided in a friend about what happened, and that's when we learned about his disgusting past.  Eventually the police looked into it, and found more incidents."

"The only case I've ever been a juror on was about this. Basically this couple had a kid and later split up, she gets a restraining order on him but then starts messaging him and they got back together.  Then they broke up again, so she reports the guy for breaking the terms of his restraining order. The charges against him were breaking the restraining order and also perverting the course of justice  (as he'd begged her not to to report him). We found him not guilty. "

"Hey, you can't just *start* with witty banter - that's at least a second act thing! First you need to establish some more solid motivations, like a tragic backstory. When you saw your nemesis's picture, did it look like he fell into a pit of acid? Have you ever been dunked in acid? If the answer to these questions is ""no"", you should consider buying a pit of acid.

Next, you need to up the stakes so your nemesis knows the game is afoot. Kidnap his puppy and leave a ransom note. If your nemesis seems stupid, leave them a book on cutting one-liners and repartee as well. If your nemesis doesn't have a puppy, try to befriend him first and give him a puppy before your inevitable betrayal. Alternatively, if you fancy yourself the hero in this story, you should leave your puppy at your nemesis's house and frame him for stealing it, then confront him on his heinous crime and engage the witty banter.  If you don't have a puppy, try to think of something else that people love, I don't know.

"Before leaving for the day, a disgruntled employee closed the emergency relief valve and shut off the main steam release on a 30-foot-tall, two-foot-diameter, and 1/2-inch-thick-walled steel extraction column, essentially turning it into a giant pipe bomb, which exploded within 10 feet of myself and two other employees. Incredibly, only one person was injured but not seriously. All three of us suffered from some hearing loss. The toxic contents of the column covered us during the explosion, which meant that all three of us needed to go through decontamination before we could be seen by paramedics. The disgruntled employee was immediately terminated, but no charges were filed. The reason nobody was injured more severely was because the point of failure was near the top, blowing the top of the column through the roof. It landed in the back alley behind the facility."

"Met this girl on match (pre smart phone apps, yes IM old.)
Her photos looked great, she was very cute, had long hair (which I personally like) but more importantly, we had some great conversations on chat-- then on phone.  Ok- yada yada,  Im waiting for her at the bar, she comes up to me and first of all, looks NOTHING, I mean NOTHING like her photo.  She had very short (like army short) hair, was quite large.  Look, I am a small guy. Im 5 7 standing straight up and 120 lbs soaking wet- its difficult for me to date someone twice my size-just not into it.  Now, I was obviously right away annoyed and asked her straight up why she used fake photos?  She said, ""I don't want to be with someone who would judge me by how I look.""  So I replied, ""I don't really want to be something who's first meeting was based on a lie.  If you are honest about what you look like, and a guy is interested in you, then you don't have to worry.  You're kidding yourself if you think physical attraction isn't a big part of the equation.""  

Now, I felt like an asshole for a bit.  But, I realized that hey, I'm honest about what I look like.  Im not a muscle guy, or really tall, I put it out there so if you like a tall built guy, you know I am not that.

So here is the weird part.  About 3-4 months later I start getting emails (thankfully this was all pre-texting) from her asking me to give her another date, she's ""lost weight.""  I told her that it had nothing to do with her weight-- it had to do with her deception and she should only change herself if she wants to, not for a guy.  She went super bunny boiler on me and I got about 50 emails or so... Was about to call the cops but finally they stopped...  "

Over the next three years, that grade trolled the teachers by removing their rings one at a time so they could see the horrified looks on the teachers' faces every time they noticed someone *else* wasn't wearing their ring anymore.

My first year teaching I had a female student with poor hygiene and odd behaviors.  For instance, she was overweight and covered with acne on her back/shoulders and she constantly picked.  She would also pick at her toenails and eat boogers.  Her haircut allowed her to sort of hide her face while eating the boogers.  Anyways, she was a senior in my class, loner, and I felt kind of bad for her.

She was in band, and they were having a competition to design the yearly shirt.  One day in my class, she had a breakdown and coudn't stop sniffling and crying.  I asked her to step outside and what was wrong thinking something devastating like family death or something, but she told me she missed the due date to submit her art for the band t-shirt.  It was crazy.

Proud moment though, behind her one day in class a freshman was talking shit about band being lame and gay.  She hears him and turns around and yells ""how about you shut the fuck up, our band is awesome and has won a shit load of state awards.""  Needless to say, it let that one slide.  

It was awesome because this was a Bible history class, of all classes.  "
"&gt; I've had to be very clear with myself, that even when I'm surrounded by 19-year-olds, and I may have felt 19, I'm not 19 anymore. You follow me?

Honestly to anyone who actually teaches, the difference between yourself and the teenagers you teach is *easily* apparent. You don't feel any older, but the kids sure seem a lot younger."
"It absolutely blew my mind the other day that people can have OCD and its never occurred to them they do. My friend has OCD for sure. Her behavior is what I use to explain to people why no, everyone is not a little ADD/OCD (having ADD myself and having people make light of not being able to focus it irks me). Her behavior is right out of a textbook. She came from parents that dump on the idea of using medication to treat your problems though so that probably plays in. "

"As someone that worked at a process serving company, I can attest to the fact that you do have to be a dick sometimes.

Dressing up really isn't part of the job, but you do have to get creative. You're dealing with people who reeeeaaally don't want to be found. Our office would contact people, claiming to be a delivery service, informing them that a family member mailed them something of a $200+ value, so it has to be hand-received. Most of the time, they'd just tell us when they'd be home."
"Watching this was kind of embarassing. I mean, we had lost to Germany the game before 1-0. So I wanted Germany to win, just to check if we sucked or Germany really was good.


At 4 goals it was already embarassing. I had a friend working in Brazil at that time, he said he saw Brazilians cry that night."

"Been to a few calls of dead bodies turning up at the water treatment facility. You think normal dead body smell is bad? Try a guy who has spent a week soaking in waste water dumped out onto a conveyor belt.

Also went to a call of a guy (a vet with ptsd) who shot himself in the head in front of his wife when she demanded he go to a wedding. The rest of the family was in the other room. And by rest I mean about 15 other people. Apparently the last thing the wife said was, ""were going to the wedding pack your bags"" and threw a suitcase at him. Well his glock was in it and he simply pulled it out and shot himself right in the temple.

Dude really didn't like weddings I guess. 

Edit: just remembered a guy who got run over by a fed ex truck was basically de gloved from the waste down. His right foot was by his right ear and his leg was straight. Also his disk was by his face.

Another guy on pcp got into a wreck.  Had an almost completely amputated right foot. Shattered right femur and a broken left ankle. Took five of us to drag him to the ground and hold him till paramedics could hit him with a sedative. He actually was able to take about five or six steps before we got him on the ground. I rode in the ambulance with him. The medic kept picking uo his foot that was attached only by skin and letting it drop. One time he said OW! Just kept thinking,  ""ow? Mother fucker your foot is off. You have no clue how much you just fucked up your life""

"Came home late at night a few weeks ago. Through my rear view mirror, I could see some dude standing in my backyard (it has a fence around it, but a small jump). I'd say about 20-30, was wearing an orange hoodie. White guy. I didn't get too good of a look, not sure how I remember these details. Kind of weirded me out. I parked my car by the fence as always, since the door I leave unlocked is on the garage. I look back to the yard. No one there. Whatever, I probably imagined it. I get this feeling of absolute dread. Heart dropping dread. I read this reddit threat once about how these people got THAT FEELING and knew instantly to run. This was some primal instinct or some shit. It said run. Gotta run. However, I am the cockiest of white kids so I decided nah, I'll exit my cad anyways. Go in the garage. Can barely force my legs to move. Open the door slightly, someone lunges at me. I nope tf outta there. I keep sprinting away 'till I get inside another door. Call my parents. 

Epilogue: the feeling didn't go away for another week, the garage area still freaks me out.

Side detail: I'm an attractive gal who comes home at the same time to the same place on schedule, so I guess they figured that out? However, I also hallucinate a lot, so I'm going to bet that they were just hallucinations."
"On a recent backroad camping trip, me and my buddy were sitting by our fire cooking/burning smokies and talking. As it started to get dark, the wind picked up and trees started to creak, and we heard a wolf howl in the distance. I ask him if he heard it, and he did. I normally don't think much about wolves, but this time I had a dog with me, and the wolves where I live have killed many a camper's dog. A few minutes went by, and we heard another howl, clearer and closer. We started building up the fire, I grabbed my tomahawk, he grabbed his machete, and we decided all bullshit aside, if we hear another howl we're gonna make a run for the truck and put my dog in. Sure enough, we heard another howl, even closer, so we get up and start heading for the truck. As we reach the halfway point, my dog stopped to pick up a stick, and as I turned around I heard another wolf howl about 20 feet away from us. I called my dog and we bolted to the truck, and we got him in safely. We headed back to our campsite, hoping to see some wolves, but they moved on, and we didn't hear them again, so I let my dog sleep in my tent with me. We were pretty sure we avoided having to fight off a pack of wolves. I slept with my tomahawk and flare gun right beside me. "

"Worked as a help desk supervisor about 15 years ago. One of my guys was getting a better job out of the state and found something in the employee handbook that said if you voluntarily separate from the company you're required to pay back any tuition assistance you got from the company. He had gone back to school on the companies' dime and even got a couple tech certs. He was gonna owe like $30k.
He had already given his 2 week notice, and he pulled me aside and explained everything and asked me to fire him. I told him I didn't think I was allowed to fire people and he said ok.
Next day my director met me at the door and said there was an issue with Kevin. He pulls up a recording and apparently all day the dude is answering his phone with 'fuck you for calling at&amp;t broadband, this is Kevin...'

So we go into the meeting. Hr, the director, everybody is there. They fire him on the spot. The whole time he's smiling his balls off. We end the meeting, he's thanking everybody and shit like that.
Scared the piss out of hr and the managers. They were positive he was gonna shoot the place up. They hired extra security for like a month, they were getting walked to their cars every day, posted Kevin's picture all over warning people to call the cops if he's seen etc.
I never had the heart to tell them why Kevin was smiling. "

"Some years back now, my mom went on a vacation with a friend of hers to Florida or somewhere for a week and a half during the winter, so I was alone at home for the time and took advantage of it by setting up my consoles on the big living room TV. One night it was snowing, and throughout the night I felt really uncomfortable. Granted, this was day 6 of 11 and I've never actually been alone in the house for that long before, so I just chalked it up to loneliness. The snow stopped sometime in the middle of the night, I went to sleep on the couch around 2am.

Next morning, plows came down the street and cleared them up as usual. I had left to pick up some stuff at the store down the street, but I stopped almost immediately when I got off my porch. There were footprints in the snow leading up to the large bay window on the side of the house, a set leading towards, and away. The ones leading in were slightly filled from snowfall, then there were two footprints positioned right next to the 'far' corner of the window, close to the rear porch and some largish bushes, that were finely detailed and pointed toe towards the wall. Someone had been standing outside the window for a while, at least, staring into my house, and left when the snow stopped. The tracks started and ended at the street, so where they came from and where they went afterwards were destroyed by the plows.

I have since bought large tint sheets to cover said window, hung thick, dark curtains, and rearranged furniture to cover the entire bottom 1/3 of the entire window length. Fuck that shit ever again, I'm a 31 year old man and the idea of someone just staring into my house through the windows gives me the kind of tense anxious horror I felt when I almost fell off a 15' cliff. I can't even sit by windows at night without fully closing curtains."

"My brother, who's a lawyer, hired these two ladies on full-time because they were really amazing at bringing business into his law firm and they also did a lot of accounting work for him. After a few months of them working for him, he started getting suspicious about them as the work they were bringing in had slowed and they seemed to be fucking off all day. He asks me to install something to monitor their computers that he provided for them. I do it, and we quickly discover what had been going on. 

These ladies were secretly directing more than half of what they were bringing into my brother's law firm to another law firm. They were going to ditch my brother after a few months and go work for the other law firm full-time. My brother was really angry about this and decided to send them off in good fashion. He called a meeting with the two ladies in his office. They come in and he has screenshots of the perpetrating e-mails blown up and printed out in front of where they sat. He let it sink in and they just sat there quiet. He then told them that he had e-mailed every lawyer and accounting firm in his huge contact network letting them know about what these two ladies had done. He asked them if they had anything to say, but the ladies just stayed quiet. He then told them to get their stuff together and get the hell out of his office.

"Deadpool's present obsession with chimichangas likely stemmed from a misinterpretation of a joke made in the Cable and Deadpool series. Deadpool sits to himself in a restaurant, repeating ""Chimichanga, chimichanga"" etc, and then says ""Don't even like chimichanga's all that much, I just love saying it"". [Here's a link to the page in question.](http://i.imgur.com/iQTVPOv.png)

Deadpool's character has been very inconsistent over the last few years though, which itself has been explained away by saying that part of his brain's regeneration makes his interests fleeting at best. But earlier iterations, like in Cable &amp; Deadpool and the 1997 Deadpool series, were a bit more consistent with the character.

The ""wacky, zaney, random"" Deadpool is a bit of a flanderization from the mid-90s stuff, wherein he behaved erratically (and comically) due to the nature of his powerset. But at least one of his internal narratives had something of a depth and internal struggle, that I think has been mostly lost in recent years. Inconsistencies with the writing between iterations have been chalked up to inconsistencies with the character, and Marvel's explosion of all-things Deadpool (and subsequent need for a few dozen writers for the character) in the early 2010's."

"I used to be friends with my adult neighbor growing up. As I got older though I noticed she didn't take very good care of her pets. Her dogs would have several unplanned litters each year, and most of the time the puppies were afraid of humans since she didn't even try to socialize them. They would follow their mothers and end up getting ran over in the road or lost in the woods somewhere or picked up strangers(who probably later threw them out after they realized they weren't tame). Out of the countless litters her dogs had probably only 10 have actually made it to adulthood. I didn't really like that as a kid, but she was a fun person to hang out with otherwise so I ignored it. Then she started getting in trouble with the law, for DUI's. At first I figured she just made a mistake, but then she just kept on getting them so I quit talking to her as much. Its not cool to repeatedly risk peoples lives like that. The final straw came when she kicked her pet cat outside just so she could get a new kitten. That cat had lived its entire life indoors, you can't just throw it out like that and expect it'll be fine, especially when she has a ton of dogs outside. If you don't want to keep two cats indoors then don't get another one. "

I've worked hard labor (18 hour swing shifts at a pet food factory) that wasn't as bad as that. At least with factory work, you can zone out and focus on the task at hand. Malls are just ... overwhelming.

Money is at stake and even their peers are gonna want some real jerks out of the game so someone with a cleaner reputation can make the money and boost the status of the profession.

Edit: wow, you use some creative writing and some violent imagery and people lose their shit. I don't have ""violent sadistic hero fantasies"". I have sense.

Let me tell you guys a story. When I was younger my best friend's mom was brutally beaten to death by her ex-boyfriend in front of her house. Everyone knew who it was. They found his DNA under her fingernails from fighting back. He was arrested. A month later he was free, awaiting trial. After everything was said and done, he didn't get convicted. His case was dismissed, for ""lack of evidence"". Almost every day from then until the day I left town, I had to see that piece of shit driving through town. Every day I had to see the man who killed my best friend's mom. Who broke my friend's heart. Who murdered one of the sweetest women I ever knew.

So you know, I'm not going to ""let the justice system take care of him"". No. I have a legal right to protect myself however possible if someone breaks into my house, and I will exercise that right. Best way to avoid the situation? Don't fucking break into my house. Don't fucking attack me. Don't fucking threaten my safety. Easy."

It's a form of polite vandalism I guess, and pre-approved by the town, which allowed this knitting club to do this. Anyway, people are pissed. Everything from, ""they look ugly and are damaging to the dinosaurs"", to ""the tourists will hate it!"", to arguments about returning the dinosaurs to their original color ( they are talking original, living dinosaur color, which no one really knows anyway). My personal favorite, ""it's a damn shame people would waste time, money, and good yarn on something this stupid, when children all over the world are freezing to death and would love a wool sweater"".

"*Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back*. All of the Naughty Dog-developed games in the series were excellent, but this one is my personal favorite.

"I work at a supermarket every saturday morning (5am-10am).

After about 3-4 years of working there, I started to get busier in weekends, which eventually led to the inevitable: I had to ask for replacement in the Facebook group. And guess what: nobody wanted to replace me, not even the people I often filled in for. This happened two or three times before I said 'fuck it' and never replaced anyone again. If they don't bother helping me out I won't bother helping them out anymore either. "

"She started hitting me over time, fractured my rib, held me hostage for a while, tried to throw herself out of my car on the freeway and threatened to kill herself if I left her.

After we broke up she found she had a brain tumour that was driving her crazy. It was removed and she's fine now but we had already parted ways and moved on. 

I never refer to her as the crazy ex, just my ex, and friend. Things were hard for both of us and we were not compatible (and the cancer may or may not have been responsible we'll never know). 

It did however give me a special appreciation for battered men though and a small interest in men's rights. I had nowhere to go and nobody cared or believed me. "
"I had basically this same situation. 

I was friends with my RA and her family came down for her birthday and her brother and I started talking. We hit it off. I thought he was totally hot and apparently he did too. We friended each other on FB, it said he was 19. Fine, his sister was 21. It was possible plus he was much taller than me (I am 5'10 so...) and he had a full beard. 

We ended up getting together. He eventually has the same break-down after he asked ""So you are fine dating me?"" and I was like ""Yeah? Why wouldn't I be?"", ""My age."", ""... You're 19. That isn't much younger than me."" (I was 21 at the time), ""I'm actually 17"" 

I ended up breaking up with him because I was like what the fuck dude. The state I was living in at the time had Romeo and Juliet laws... except I turned 21... which aged me out of the range. I mean, like, I felt like he was way out of my league and I knew that he would inevitably push me to do something dumb (He was *constantly* trying to sext me... during class). 

Anyway, we end up getting back together like a month later with the promise that like we won't do anything physical until he was 18 in a few months. Fine. He was hot, I was busy with school, we didn't even live in the same city. 

Eventually something came up where I asked him to drive up to see me and he admits he can't. ""Oh? No car?"" ""No, I just have my permit"" ""haha, why not your license?"" (Getting suspicious at this point). ""... I'm actually 15"" 

I just stopped texting at that point. A few days later I get a text asking if we were still dating. I do feel bad for ghosting him but c'mon. He lied twice. 

Eventually he admitted he really liked me and wanted to date me but (correctly) thought I wouldn't date a 15-year old. I lied and said it wasn't about his age (It was), but the fact he lied (which was a lie).

I looked back on his FB a few years later and... he wasn't that hot. Like he was attractive, but his multicolored mohawk and height made him seem so much more attractive (Or maybe puberty didn't continue being nice, hahahaha)"

"Edit: Spoilers Ahead.

Really? I did not get that at all. The worst thing Nick(?) does is cheat on his wife right? She straight up manipulates a guy, murders him and then plays innocent to ultimately get away with it without showing a lick of remorse. This is after coming up with an insane plan to get an innocent man thrown in jail for life for cheating on her. Plus all the evidence Nick finds that indicates she's done stuff like this all her life.

Nick was an idiot and a cheater, a little socially maladjusted maybe, but hardly on the same level of crazy. He was an unreliable narrator that at times has you questioning whether or not he actually did kill her, which is what makes the actual reveal of how crazy Amy is even better."

"It's reasonable, however, to decline to show someone leniency for the crime they committed when they show no remorse for it. If it's a minor crime and the defendant is contrite, their own guilty conscience can be sufficient punishment to ensure they won't repeat the crime. If they're rolling their eyes at someone who's appealing to their intrinsic morality by scolding them, then it's clear they'll need extrinsic motivation to behave properly."

"This didn't happen in my house, but it was still the oddest, most out of place thing I've ever found.

When I was 16, my dad bought a junker from the father of a boy who was in my Boy Scout troop. He wanted it to be me and my brothers (we're twins) first car, but it broke down as soon as he got it home. It ended up being a learning experience, as I tore it apart. I've always loved taking things apart, and though a car wasn't the biggest thing I've tackled, it was new, and wouldn't be a loss if it ended up in pieces.

I took the entire interior out, and under the floor carpet, I found a Greek coin, from that next year. I took the car apart in 2003, but the coin was a 2005. I have no idea how it got there, let alone how it was from two years in the future. I have the coin somewhere around here, though its nothing special-it looks exactly as it should. It remains the weirdest thing I've found, ever. "

I'm a web dev, and I was working on a page that had a pretty enormous amount of information on it, all set up in tables.

Client calls and goes, ""It's broken.""

Me: What's wrong?

Client: I can't change any of the cells.

Me: Well... no. The table isn't editable.

Client: Why not?!

Me: Uh, because you didn't ask for it to be?

Client: I asked for a table, I assumed it would come with all the usual things tables can do!

Me: Tables can *usually* display information. That's it. What else did you want?

Client: Everything normal tables can do!

This continued for several loops of the same conversation before I finally came to realize that the client apparently wanted me to build Excel for them in javascript :/

Edit: I should also point out that this was a static, public-facing website with no credential-system of any kind. And they seemed upset with the notion that building everything that would be required for such a system would require a teensy bit more money than they'd paid for their very basic info-dump static site."

I once waited 8 hours in a busy downtown hospital with a 2 year old with a broken arm. It was my mistake because I should have taken him to the children's hospital 10 mins away.

Then she comes for the free refill because she's a gold star member, goes to the bathroom with the coffee, empties it into her personal cup, then tries to get another free refill. First few times, we let her do it because we had no proof beyond a hunch, but when it's a daily occurrence, you start to notice.

Hot brewed coffee refill is $0.52.

Can't tell if you're joking, but this isn't really how books work. Published books, and especially non-fiction ones, go through a *rigorous* peer-review process where a bunch of people who (*should,* at least) be experts in their field read through a work to make sure it's accurate to the highest degree. Outside of vanity publishers, books are way more complex operations than ""One person knocks it out and it hits the shelves"".

"I fell into depression for a few years after my fiance a few years earlier passed away. Most friends pretty much cut off from me after knowing I was depressed. So at that point, I pretty much was convinced with my lack of much friends, I wasn't gonna meet any one else. So I figured I give the relationship a shot or be alone forever. Few times of meeting her, not only did I have zero attraction for her, but she didn't even seem like someone I could have a compatibility with as simple friends. With my mom's convincing that we will grow to be compatible, and according to her mom saying she liked me a lot, i gave it a shot. Went through with the marriage. 

Honestly, the moment she confessed to me of her affair and that she wanted a divorced, I was more relieved (maybe even some joy) than disappointed. I was just angered that she went through with the marriage in the first place, all the wasted money and effort, when she was probably seeing the other guy already. "

"My dad was a landlord of a 4-apartment building in the late 90's. Why did he quit? He had a tenant, let's call him Mark. Mark was a great tenant for I think 2 years, quiet, polite. Mark fixed minor stuff around the apartment himself. Mark asked dad for power tools on a few occasions and these were always returned promptly. 

On a thanksgiving weekend, dad gets two panicked calls from his tenants and one call from the police. He rushes to his building and there are Crown Vics with lights blaring and a small army of unmarked black vehicles. He is not allowed in. He is escorted to the station and interviewed. All of the questions are about Mark. Dad answers in detail but when he asks what's going on, he gets no straight answers. In the weeks following, new information comes to light: 1) the walls and floors in Mark's apartment are covered in human blood and hair, 2) there might or might not be several types of this blood and hair, 3) none of it is Mark's. 

As of this writing, Mark is still not in custody.  Dad emails the department every year to check if there's any progress with the case. 

Dad was paranoid for years afterwards, telling mom he saw Mark on the street several times a month. He's better now. "

"As a man who used to do this: wearing oversized clothing to try and hide your weight. 

It doesn't matter if you're 100lbs or 300lbs, wear the clothing size that corresponds to your body size. You're not going to hide what you've got on you, and wearing such big clothing screams insecurity and trying to cover it up, which is inherently unattractive. On the other hand, people love dudes who dress to their size, even if they're big. It shows confidence and it also just looks a lot better than a bunch of dead space between and under different curves. 

Get a good tailor, have him/her make you a couple good work shirts, a couple of casual button downs, and a couple of single-color t-shirts and your set. Same thing goes with pants. They should be snug-fitting and come down right below your ankles. 


Edit: And on the opposite end, don't buy small sizes to try to look slimmer, it just accentuates every curve you've got. "

But in the west (well, the US) we're totally schizophrenic about it.  We have highly suggestive and revealing clothing everywhere in public but hold tiny little bits of flesh to be sacred.

"I'm not airline crew, but I've flown a lot and had a few interesting things. 

~ In a tropical country, when getting ready to take off I noticed condensation/steam/fog gathering around the aircondition vents. I figured it was just humidity, whatever, right? When the plane began taxiing I heard a terrifying crackling noise, that was only getting worse the faster the plane moved. I thought it might be electricity, and I glanced at the flight attendants but they were like, poker faced. 

I was wondering if only I was hearing it, or if it's something I should say before we took off, but a combination of not wanting to sound like an idiot if this was normal and their lack of caring when clearly they should have heard it caused me to hope for the best--though by now it sounded like someone was rolling marbles in the overhead compartments and the crackling was really loud. 

A small part of me figured it must be ice. And it was. The crackling sound dissipated about thirty minutes into the flight and I read later that it's caused by humidity. Still terrifying though when you didn't know what it was. I also love watching Mayday and all I could think of was who was going to play me on the inevitable re-enactment.

~ Flight from Florida to New Orleans in April going through a cold front, taking off amidst thunderstorms. 

Never again, though I saw some awesome cloud formations. I've never felt a plane jolt like that before, we were getting knocked sideways for about an hour. 

You know it's bad when you hear the pilot, in a tense voice, bark on the intercom ""STEWARDESSES GET BACK TO YOUR SEATS NOW"" as they rush to put their drink carts away and buckle themselves in. 


~ CAT--clear air turblence. The plane was full of teenagers and we all screamed like maniacs while everyone else just glared at us. It still felt like we dropped like a rollecoaster. 

The most recent flight I was on was only one day before a bad storm rolled in that caused lots of planes to divert and cancellations so it was an annoyingly turbulent flight and probably the roughest landing I've ever been in--nothing dramatic, just really uncomfortable and almost near-constant dropping feeling on the way in as we were jolted from side to side, it felt like a really steep landing in crosswinds. We circled for a long time in a holding pattern too--you could feel the exact moment we turned against the wind when the plane went in for final approach, as we started the turbulence dance again.

Timur's body was exhumed from his tomb on 19 June 1941 and his remains examined by the Soviet anthropologist Mikhail M. Gerasimov, Lev V. Oshanin and V. Ia. Zezenkova. It was determined that Timur was a tall and broad-chested man with strong cheek bones. At 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 meters), Timur was tall for his era. The examinations confirmed that Timur was lame and had a withered right arm due to his injuries. His right thighbone had knitted together with his kneecap, and the configuration of the knee joint suggests that he had kept his leg bent at all times and therefore would have had a pronounced limp.[73][74] Gerasimov reconstructed the likeness of Timur from his skull and found that Timur's facial characteristics displayed Mongoloid features with some Caucasoid admixture. Oshanin also concluded that Timur's cranium showed predominately the characteristics of a South Siberian Mongoloid type.[74]

It is alleged that Timur's tomb was inscribed with the words, ""When I rise from the dead, the world shall tremble."" It is also said that when Gerasimov exhumed the body, an additional inscription inside the casket was found, which read, ""Whomsoever opens my tomb shall unleash an invader more terrible than I.""[75] In any case, three days after Gerasimov began the exhumation, Adolf Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa, the largest military invasion of all time, upon the Soviet Union.[76] Timur was re-buried with full Islamic ritual in November 1942 just before the Soviet victory at the Battle of Stalingrad.

"It's within the backstory of the novels. Thousands of years before the novels took place humanity had spread across the universe from earth using hi-tech technology and computer AI. The AI eventually rose up against the humans and there was an immense war across the galaxy. The humans eventually won but they saw the dangers computer AI and integration with technology could cause. 

This led to the religious prohibition against thinking machines and the innovations of ways for humanity to replace the destroyed technology with alternative methods (this is why in the dune universe you rarely see technology more electronically complex than a simple circuit board). Instead of building machines to do their bidding humanity turned itself towards spirituality and psychic evolution as a way to achieve its goals, much accelerated by the use of spice to extend lifespan and  unlock latent psychic potential. Humanity's goal was now to master itself. Some humans actually elected to make themselves into tools. The Spacing Guild focussed on replacing space faring technology through the breeding of the navigators, using spice to force sped up evolution so the navigators would be able to use their powers to bend space time and travel anywhere in the universe instantly. Another example of this is the mentat order, humans conditioned and adapted so their computation powers would match those of machines.

Meanwhile the Bene Gesserat (sp?) witches started a different path, a path designed to breed the ultimate human, the Kwizats Haderak, one which they perceived as being truly pure human and free from all the degradations of the human spirit caused by their strange universe.

If you remember Paul's mother was a Bene Gesserat who never made far enough to become a Reverend Mother, she was tasked with bearing a daughter for Duke Leto Atreides, so it could be married to the Harrkonnen heir and hopefully produce the Kwizats Haderak. However, she broke the rules and had a son anyway because of her love for the Duke. 

Paul had to have his ""humanity"" tested because they needed to see what the results of this unsanctioned male birth were, and whether there was any chance he would be the chosen one. Otherwise they wouldn't have suffered him to continue living.

So ultimately by humanity they mean a most evolved state of humanity, a human who has mastered themselves and is no longer that the whim of their instincts and desires. There are no non-humans in the Dune universe afaik, at least no in the literal sense of intelligent life that didn't come from the human race, but the Bene Gesserat consider humans who cannot achieve a higher state of spiritual enlightenment to be truly humans, they are merely animals to them. There are however many sects of humanity who have broken off and forced themselves to evolve into a different state (like the guild navigators), who barely resemble humans any more and are generally disliked and feared by the Bene Gesserat order, they are often tolerated by the great houses and the emperor though, because of their utility. 

edit: I'll just add that it's this premise that makes the Dune series so timeless and ground breaking, instead of the usual sci-fi path of technology, it looks at a post technology society that has returned to feudalism and religious extremism as a path of progress for humanity, the evolution of the internal state of being human rather than the adaptation of our environment. The period the novels are set in is actually a society of technological stagnation much like the dark ages, all the technology they need to achieve things things has already existed for thousands of years, and the way of life is set in stone and highly cemented, which means humanity has the time to focus  on mastering themselves rather than the outer world. A good example of this is how Paul's education to become Duke is entirely focussed around teaching him self-discipline and improving his mental powers of deduction and perception, rather than on teaching him how the physical world functions, the latter being something people in this time period simply take for granted.

"Well yeah, I believe we should decriminalize all drugs. Nothing positive comes from locking up addicts, and especially the recreational users. You wouldn't lock up your dad who smokes would you? So why that guy who wants to snort a line at a party?

Decriminalize all drugs, and instead put money into proper rehabilitation centers like the Portuguese have. Help the junkies become functional members of society, not lock them up; it is both better for us and them.

And for recreational use? The biggest harm is that the drugs are illegal, making people have to get shit from potentially dodgy dealers, with dodgy doses and drugs cut with other shit. With drugs decriminalized, and government provided, you can go buy 100ug of LSD and guess what? You'll get 100ug of LSD. You've got a creativity block?

"My post is very specific to Chicago, I'm not too solid on my smoking laws elsewhere, but I do know Chicago is very strict. There are pretty much no exceptions to smoking in public buildings; at that, outdoor public places are also a no-no. That means no smoking in parks, playgrounds, harbors, beaches, etc.  I know for the hotel (and all public buildings) the rule is never in the building, and 15ft from all entrances/exits.


Generally if a smoker would ask for a smoking room, we'd explain the rule (and consequences) to them, and there's also signs &amp; literature in all rooms with the same info. On a side note, we'd always note who asked for smoking rooms because about half the time they'd light up anyhow, and we'd get complaints from the rest of the rooms on that floor. At least then we'd know who to talk to."

Tyler is what the Narrator believed he wanted to be. Tyler is the ""ultimate male"". Tyler is the Narrator's reaction to not being able to achieve society's ideas of masculinity.

Tyler &amp; the Narrator aren't opposites though. Tyler is part of the Narrator and therefore represents some part of himself which he comes to realize is incorrect and an incredibly dangerous part of himself hence the attempting to kill himself just to get rid of Tyler."

It scored 9 and 10's across the board. Big reviewers put out reviews before even finishing the game. Not that it's that hard to blame them because finishing 80 hours of repetitive side missions and unnecessary credit sequences takes true dedication.
  
The game suffered from multiple flaws but got a free pass because no game reviewer would ever naysay gaming's greatest victim Hideo Kojima following the Kojima v. Konami fallout.  
  
This is a game that opted to trade in most of the quirkiness that made it such a beloved series in exchange for begging you to take it's ""dark themes"" seriously....all while throwing in zombies, a giant whip-sword wielding gundam with a flamethrower penis, and a horribly written victim character that shakes her tits and ass in your face everytime you set the controller down.
  
This is an unfinished game that is repetitive, inconsistent with it's previous entries, has god awful pacing, bizarre directorial choices, and had a really shitty online launch before eventually settling into a comfortable place as a microtransaction platform hosted by a shit heel company that almost seems to resent it's customer base.  
  
But despite all these things, all these flaws that have crippled other games in the past, no one would dare throw themselves on the fire by disparaging golden child Hideo Kojima's final ""masterpiece""."

"School trip to Malaysia. Decide to do some parkour with two friends. I eventually find an easy gap I can jump over. Twist: It's an open sewer filled with disgusting floating unmentionables about a metre below, with a railing on either side to hold on to. I easily make the gap one way, turn around, jump over again and almost slip into the fly-infested river below. Managed to scramble my way up, and guffawwed with my friends before we agreed that we'd done enough parkour for one day.

Not dangerous per-se, but I dread to think of the flora of bacteria in that sewer. Goddamn, that was a stupid thing to do :p

"In college, when we wrote essays for this one prof we would always compare marks and comments. The marks were always so similar regardless of the effort that went into the papers, even when the differences were obvious, and the comments always so generic, so we just assumed he barely read the papers. Later, this one kid wrote in the middle of one of his papers: ""No one reads this anyways so what's the point. I'm just going to go closet drinking and jerk off when I'm done writing."" He was asked to remain after class and was asked to redo his paper.

Turns out our prof is just a very easy marker and has no imagination."

"Bullying or abuse. Men get abused by women too, yet keep quiet about it. Men are expected to be strong, so we can't talk about being abused, and when we do, it's not taken seriously.

If a man is in an abusive relationship, and he calls the police, the man will be separated from his home, either jailed, or at a friends house. If there is an abusive relationship and the women is being abused, the same happens. That's not right.

Also, teachers or other people that are meant to stop bullying never do. A lot of parents accept bullying as a way to make them stronger. No, it doesn't. It makes you feel horrible and alone and I hate it."

I disagree with a lot of these answers. Insecurity does not inherently equal weakness. It's okay to be insecure or unconfident in some circumstances.

"I was depressed for about 3 years, don't know if it was clinical or just due to some life choices and emotional let downs, but I didn't realize I was depressed till two of my best friends got engaged to each other and I felt nothing about it. I didn't feel joy, I didn't feel sad that my relationships with him and her would be changing, I didn't feel down because yet another person younger than me was getting married and I was almost 30 and never really dated anyone. That's when I found someone I could talk to about it, my father actually, although he didn't really understand it having never experienced depression, he was always there to talk and reassure me that I wasn't a useless piece of trash that no one would miss. 

TL;DR - I agree it's hard to tell when you're depressed I had a similar experience, and am sorry you're going through that!"

"So, this isn't word for word what someone specifically said, but it is something that made me want to wring people's necks.  

I played soccer for about 8 years and I was a goalkeeper. And you see, the issue with being a goalie is that you're either the *hero*, or the *goat*.  

When the ball goes into the net, almost all of the time it was **NOT** solely the keeper's fault, because how did the ball get there? Because our **WHOLE** team let the ball get back to the box.  

Essentially, don't give your goalie shit for letting up a shot, because if you do, you're quite possibly a cunt. Granted there are times where your goalie seriously screws up, but that's why you're a team, to *pick eachother up*, not put eachother down. We all make mistakes.  

ESPECIALLY because 9/10 times, a trained goalie will know a thousand times more about their job than you, so don't try to tell them what's what, because it's not always their fault, and when it is, they know.  

OKAY WELP rant over. Don't be an ass to your keeper! (unless he himself is an ass, then ass him as much as you please!)

When the subject of people on the dole comes up and they say things like 'they should just get jobs', 'they're lazy parasites' and it's a 'waste of their tax dollars' I shut the heck up, because I'm on the dole myself. I feel like I can't defend against those statements, being on the dole, and I feel like I am a parasite every single day. If those types of people could feel the worthlessness, the desperation and the longing to be a part of the workforce, they'd know calling people on the dole 'worthless' and a 'waste of money' is exactly how most of us feel. Every. Damn. Day."

She had shared custody of her son, and I'd usually bring her to her house on friday night so she could take care of things there, and her sons father would come and pick him up. 
  
That particular Friday was a few days after she made me tell my entire family and call my father as I stated above. I get home after dropping her off, and on my computer she's still signed into Facebook, and it just so happens that her messages to her fathers son are still up. I didn't really think anything of it, I just assumed maybe she was telling him what time to meet her or whatnot... Well, boy was I wrong.
  
She was actually asking him to set up an appointment for an abortion with planned parenthood, and asked him if she'd take him. That night he got his face destroyed (there was a lot of built up tension between the two of us, that mainly started on his end. He used to beat her, threatened to do so while me and her were together, threatened me as well, etc.). 
  
And well, a week or so later she went through with the abortion. 
  
A week after that she contacts me telling me how sorry she is and she wished she never did it and wanted me back.

So Dummy McDumbass checks into a cheap motel and starts cooking meth right in the middle of town with his borderline retarded tweeker bitch GF. I found out all this on the wedding day. So, after the cops kick down the door, they make bail, and in a last ditch bid to get conjugal visits and a lighter sentance they arranged a quick wedding. On her mom's front porch. With a ""native american"" priest officiating. He was some old white bread hippy who watched too many movies. The wedding song was a song on a mix tape played on a single speaker cassette player.

Went on a date with a girl, been asking her for months - she's really hot. She took me to an expensive restaurant, while I was expecting a walk around the park and have coffee. I'm okay financially, but this was out of my budget, to be frank, and I was raised in an old fashion - that is, I would've paid the whole bill even if it rapes my credit card. She was a horrible person - mean to waiters, complaining about quality of food (which was fantastic, btw), and had conversations topics such as ""well, Hitler wasn't as bad as people say"" and ""Why should I pay taxes? Screw poor people"". I'm dead serious - I thought I was being on prank-show with hidden cameras at the beginning. I thought dates/people like that are from the movie scripts. So, I excused myself to bathroom, spoke with a good looking waitress who serving us, apologized for my date, paid MY share of the bill and asked the waitress to lead me out through a backdoor. Fuck that person."

"Ok... God, where do I start?

Fair Trade: How has Trump spelled out a way to create a level playing field in foreign trade? Has he given any ideas on how he can create more manufacturing jobs in the US, and not overseas, without any type of burden to the companies creating the product? Has Trump laid out a tariff or tax plan on foreign imports that can make US made products more competitive? How would Trump combat the increased price of goods when we cannot purchase foreign made products at a discounted rate? 

Supply Chain Management: You gave the BLM along with the Forestry and National Parks Departments as an example of mismanagement and the need for streamlining in government? Those are among the cheapest organizations in the Federal government, and what does that ha email to do with Trump? What is he planning to do with them that will save our financial situation?  Had he or anyone else even spoke about this subject in the election? What about the bloated corpses of Medicare, Social Security, and the Department of Defense? What does he have to say about those behemoths, and how he can streamline them?

Lobbying: First off, lobbying isn't the problem. The problem is people accepting the resources from special interests, because they have no morals. Furthermore, the Congress are the cowards who need to set proper limits on the amount of funds that can be given by a source to a campaign. Trump, and all the others cannot influence this system at this time, and to say he is any better than the rest is a false statement. Trump's policies in business do not translate to government. You mentioned the casinos he RAN into the ground, leaving hundreds, if not thousands, of people without work. He did this to simply write off debt, and balance his books. What government agencies and programs will he run into the ground, possibly leaving millions unemployed, to balance the US debt?

Seriously, the man hasn't given a single concrete idea of what he plans to do. He is a true charlatan, and would gladly see the nation bankrupt, as long as he can turn a buck. 

Also, he really isn't that rich in the scheme of things. Look him up on the Forbes list."

"He wasn't. The age restriction was imposed by wizards, but there's nothing in the rules of the tournament itself that prevent underage wizards from competing. Why Dumbledore, arguably the most powerful wizard in the world, didn't just Charm the Goblet into adding that rule into its selection process is another potential plot hole. Clearly the Goblet can be tricked - I'm paraphrasing, but I think Dumbledore (or one of the teachers, anyway) says that the Goblet was put under a very strong Confundus curse to be tricked into allowing a 4th school in a 3 school competition. I'm surprised Dumbledore didn't do something similar himself instead of relying on the imperfect solution of drawing the Age Line around the Goblet. "

You scored in the top 0.4 percentile? Thats fantastic, there is literally 4 million people who are as good or better, all competing in the rat race that is life.

What does low bred yokels even mean? Education in china is fubar if you are average, no chance, you need to COMPETE. You know that asian stereotype with education? This is where it all fucking comes from. The actual system is fucked. Its so fucked, you could cheat and still lose out. Old money lost out hard in the cultural revolution, but there is so much new money in China its absurd. Double digit growth rate for how fucking long? [Im shanghainese, this is 1990 shanghai compared to Shanghai today](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/what-were-reading/Picture%2017.png) Backwater but sizeable city to  mega metropolis as people came in from surrounding rural areas. When I last went, my aunt said that roughly 50% of people in shanghai cant speak shanghainese.

My uncles/aunts, my parents, their heirloom gold was taken from them by the government. They lived 9 to a room on mats (fathers side was grandmother, grandfather, aunt, 5 uncles, my father). If you could be selfish and shit on someone else to get another room for your family/yourself, you would do it in a heartbeat. How much better would your standard of living improve from something like that? Even little things, getting the fresher bread by getting to the front of the line by being an asshole isnt just fresh bread for that day, its getting bread. Period.

My entire family at my parents generation (~50-60 years old, lived through the cultural revolution/the aftermath) is tertiary level educated. Hell, its how my parents got into Australia, on a weird exchange thingy through the university. All those tourists? They are almost certainly tertiary educated wealthy businessmen. Since only the rich can fuck off overseas. Its funny because the communists ingrained a level of competition in the individuals of society that capitalism never could. That desperation level of need and drive to succeed, to live.

One of my family friends went to school in China for a couple months while his family was doing business. He grew up in Australia and spoke fluent english but struggled in the English classes in China since those fuckers would memorize entire paragraphs of sounds without necessarily understanding any of it. This is like daily levels of homework.

Also I dont understand what you mean by people without culture. Feng shui, random buddhist shit, superstition and traditional shit. China is heavily cultured because a lot hasnt modernized. A lot is still based on old traditional bullshit. I dont even know how it works, but Im fairly sure (90%) one of my grandmothers is full buddhist despite the religion getting clamped the fuck out during the cultural revolution. There are also a shitload of fat buddhas throughout the country. And finally, I dont even know how you define what ""cultured"" is. On average, I think that the average Chinese has a stronger link to the past and their own practices than someone from say Australia. And thats not saying that I am uncultured or that Australia in general is uncultured. Its just an old, old, really fucking old ""country"" with old practices that die hard.

tl;dr  

* Hyper competitive system with more people competing for the prime spots than you can believe or comprehend. These are fresh spots, limited availability, only in the past couple decades as China has boomed

* Education has always been key, its stressed so hard by every single family to get educated. 

* They are plenty cultured, just a different culture to you.

* Didnt really cover it but strong family units is where the us vs them comes from. 'Us' for me is society at large, 'us' for my uncle is the immediate family. Doesnt matter about 'them', they are not 'us'.

"That's not what karma is.

The West has largely misinterpreted the concept of karma. It's not a form of causality strictly hinging on your behavior.


It's rather a form of psychology. Where your world view - your perceptive lens - dictates how you'll react in any given situation. It's not a concept of doing good things will make good things happen to you. See the world through a lens of love and understanding, and that's how it'll be reflected as well. Choose to perceive through fear and aggression, and instead that will be the type of world you inhabit. 

'What you send out, is what you'll receive' doesn't consider a cosmic tally. Against which your good and bad deeds are counted. Simply that who you choose to be in this moment, influenced by your past, dictates who you'll be in the next moment. Choose love - and you'll see possibility in everything. Choose fear - and you'll find obstacles at every juncture. "

I have a tattoo on my hip and one on my side. They're visible only if I want them to be. Trends like that happen becsuse, although it is quickly becoming more and more acceptable and even common for women to be inked, there are still unfortunate stigmas and, funnily enough, a lot more stigma gets placed on the women who get tattoos where they are easily hudden.

"This makes me think of the 'average pilot' problem.

In the 1940's, aerial combat was pretty new, and a lot of U.S. pilots were having trouble controlling their planes.  Steering and maneuvering your plane required leverage; you had to really pull or push at the yoke to move it, and the seats just weren't designed well for such a thing. Imagine your car seat being too far back, or the back support being tilted at a weird angle. Now imagine doing that, but at the demolition derby.

They turned to the design of the cockpit itself.  It was designed for the average pilot; the designers had taken the measurements of hundreds of pilots to determine things like the distance from the seat to the dashboard, or the height of the windshield, the dimensions of the helmet, and so on.

Turns out, that literally zero pilots were average.  If someone was the right height, they'd have different leg lengths.  If they were the right weight, their heads were different sizes, and so on.  Literally _no_ pilots were the right build to fit in the standard airplane.

So, they made the seats adjustable, they offered different sized helmets, they added the ability to tilt the yoke, and all sorts of other things.  It was weird at the time, but now it's pretty normal.  And crashes dropped tremendously, saving millions and millions of dollars and the lives of many pilots, winning us the war, and paving the way for the same principles to be placed in cars, allowing hundreds of millions of people to drive themselves from A to B without crashing.

If we decide we want to start culling the gene pool, where are we going to start and stop? We'd obviously only want people with certain mental capabilities, so their IQ should be... let's say 120.  Oh, and they shouldn't need glasses.  They probably shouldn't have a weight problem.  We don't want to keep the people who have allergies, or even seasonal allergies.  We should just get rid of anyone with a mental illness.

Now, how many people are left if you categorically slash _all_ of the 'inferior' folks away? Almost everyone has _something_ about them that wouldn't fit into this model.

Turns out it's usually better to adjust the world to fit the people, rather than try to force the people to meet some arbitrary standard.  Corrective things like glasses, medicine, even wheelchairs, were all 'weird' when they started out, but now they're becoming more common, and they let people contribute to society when they might not have been able to if we'd just decided to cull them from the gene pool."

**Lion** *Panthera leo*

Probably the most immediately recognizable of the big cats, lions live in the tropical grasslands of sub-Sahara Africa and in the Gir Forest of India, though they were once ranged throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere. Curiously, there are still occasional sightings of surviving American lions--but that's a discussion for another day.

Lions live in prides, ranging in number from four or five to upwards of twenty. The prides are led by a small group of adult males, while the remaining females are almost all related to one another. Male cubs leave the pride when they reach maturity, while females stay with the pride their entire lives.

Lionesses generally do most of the hunting, though when pursuing larger, more powerful game such as giraffe or cape buffalo, males will assist. Lionesses hunt by ambush; a few will charge the prey towards pre-positioned hunting mates. Lions primarily hunt ungulates--primarily zebra and various species of antelope, including impala and wildebeest. Yes, wildebeest are  a species of antelope. 

Lions are among the larger of the big cats, surpassed only in size by Bengal and Siberian tigers, with fully mature males weighing up to five hundred pounds. Due to their size, lions are apex predators--upon maturity, they will not be hunted for food by other carnivores and their presence is vital to healthy ecosystems. Females are considerably smaller, weighing up to three hundred pounds, though it's rare that a male exceeds four hundred pounds.

Lions are not terribly long-lived. Because males are driven from the pride upon reaching maturity (usually after about two years), they must fend for themselves. Littermates have a tendency to stick together, but lions have high infant mortality rates. When an outsider male lion challenges the pride's male, it is not unheard of for the fight to go to the death. Furthermore, if the outsider male in the victor, he will kill any cubs of the dominant male he just ousted.

Despite their reputation, lions are not the fiercest of Africa's predators. A lone male can be driven off by traditionally-armed Masai warriors. Lions have an antagonistic relationship with hyenas, with both species frequently stealing kills from one another."

"My friend Jeff runs a Death Pool every year. You have to pay $5 to get in. This is how it works:

**Rules**

* Game runs from Jan 1 to Dec 31

* Choose ~~Five~~ 10 celebrities. They have to be famous enough to have a wikipedia page. You can't pick somebody who lives across the street from you that you know is going to die. 

* If you believe somebody is genuinely famous, but they don't have a wikipedia page, you can file an appeal with Jeff to have them considered eligible. All decisions by Jeff are final, so being a whiny lil bitch will get you nowhere. 

* When somebody on your list dies, you get points. 

* Points are calculated like this: 100 minus the person's age. So if a 92 year old celebrity dies, you only get 8 points. But if a 27 year old dies, you get 73 points. 

* Whoever has the most points at midnight on New Year's eve wins. 



**Strategy**

* The smart money is on a balanced list. 
* You want some old people who are probably going to keel over, so you make sure to get *some* points.
* But you also want a few young trainwrecks. Younger celebrities with drug problems, mafia connections, dangerous habits. 
* The 2013 winner had Paul Walker. He was 40. That was 60 points. That's a lot of points.

No one should be looking at your socks—they're functional—and having socks=pants creates a clear division between feet and legs. Socks that are the same color as the shoes can make the shoes look like boots to a casual observer. I've even tracked down some denim-colored crew socks when I'm wearing Chuck Taylors with jeans, and I think it looks great. I just have to make sure the shoes look clean and stylish, because with blended socks, the shoes really stand out."

And I did X Y and Z just like a Sagittarius would.  After listening and prompting her to tell me more for another 10 minutes. Asking her stuff like am I right for my girlfriend and such. 

I finally revealed to her that my license was wrong and that I was really a Scorpio. She had a blank stare for a minute and then said ""that's exactly what a scorpio would do"" '____'

"The song ""Tik Tok"" was written by a guy named [Benny Blanco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Blanco), and it contains the line ""We kick them to the curb unless they look like Mick Jagger.""

That's a little bit strange, right? Mick Jagger wasn't exactly at the height of his attractiveness when the piece in question came out. Here's something interesting, though: Benny Blanco also had a hand in writing ""[Moves Like Jagger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moves_like_Jagger),"" by Maroon 5.

This is where things get weird:

The song ""The Time (Dirty Bit),"" as performed by the Black Eyed Peas, includes the following line: ""All these girls, they like my swagger, they calling me Mick Jagger,  I be rolling like a Stone."" That song was written by [John DeNicola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_DeNicola), who used to produce the music for a band called Kara's Flowers... although you might know them better by their current name of Maroon 5.

The song ""Heart and Soul,"" as performed by The Jonas Brothers, contains the following line: ""Making mistakes, but that won’t matter, if you can swag like old Mick Jagger."" It was written by a woman named [Antonina Armato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonina_Armato), who is managed by [Downtown Music Publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Music_Publishing)... who *also* manage Maroon 5.

Now, we have to ask... even though there's obviously a link here, what's the actual connection back to Mick Jagger? There must be something, because if you have a look a Google Trends, you'll see that [Mick Jagger's popularity spiked](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=mick%20jagger) with the release of each song. The only time in recent memory when it has been higher is during a period in March of 2014, when his girlfriend died. Why does there seem to be a cabal of artists trying to artificially inflate his appeal and popularity? 

In order to answer that, we need to turn to [Vivendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivendi).

This is a company which owns a lot of stuff. Their subsidiaries include DailyMotion, UbiSoft, GameLoft... and the Universal Music Group. The Rolling Stones signed to Universal Music in 2008. In 2010, all of the songs listed above were released.

[Look at those Google trends again](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=mick%20jagger). 2008 marked Mick Jagger's *lowest ever* dip in popularity, and the slump continued until February of 2010. In September of that same year, The Rolling Stones [re-released their rare concert movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies_and_Gentlemen:_The_Rolling_Stones), securing the number one spot on four different countries' charts - the US and the UK being two of them - second place on four more, and a Double Platinum certification in Canada. 

Strangely enough, though, the only other place (besides the United States) where Platinum status was achieved was in France... which is where [Vivendi is located](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivendi).

What if all of this was carefully planned and executed?

What if there's a shadowy organization that's intent on promoting Mick Jagger for their own profit?

What if I made all of this up on a whim, and just found whatever tenuous evidence I could to support it?

**TL;DR: Mick Jagger is a puppet of the recording industry.**"

"Clubs: Wait in line for 15-20 minutes while the asshole bouncer decides if you have enough girls with you to get in, pay the $15 cover charge, wait in line for another 10 minutes to get an overpriced drink, wade into a tight group of people to dance while people jostle you and spill your drink. You start chatting up a girl but it's so fucking loud that you can't hear each other.

Pub: Walk in for free as soon as you get there. Walk up to the bar and wait for 2 minutes and then order a reasonably priced drink. Sit down with a group of mates outside in the sun and talk for 3-4 hours.

"Throwaway time.

When I was a teen I never had any sexual interest in my sister until one night I dreamed that I was eating her out. From that moment I started seeing her differently, she was sexy, fit. So I started trying to see her naked when walking past her room, sniffing her flip flops when I'm home alone. I'm 23 years old now and from time to time I go and fap to her pictures. My biggest sexual achievement (I'm virgin as fuck) was cumming while sniffing a pair of socks she left on the ground.

"Someone who uses their religion to make others feel bad, intimidated, etc. These people are one of the most narcissistic people. Usually these people are insecure about their own wrong actions.

Also, people who use atheism to bully others. If you are an atheist and see someone with a Bible and are annoyed, just let it go and let them go on with their business, unless they annoy you about their religion. Some atheists like to make themselves feel enlightened and smart but end up having a pseudo-intellectual discussion. If you think you are smart and everyone else is stupid just because you are an atheist, you are just compensating for something and have problems.

"Many, many moons ago, I used to manage a Papa John's.  We had a driver who had a couple of pretty good scams going on that it took us a while to figure out.  Most of our employees were cross-trained so that when we were busy the drivers could answer the phones and take orders.  This driver had been there for a few years and had been given access to edit existing orders as well.

The first scam he ran was a classic coupon scam.  We had a lot of standard coupons with standard orders, like a large one topping pizza and a drink for $9.99.  The real price without a coupon would be something like $14.99.  This coupon was a standard that was on ALL of our box toppers, so we always had stacks of them laying around.  If someone ordered one of the standard coupon orders but did NOT have a coupon, when he got back to the store he would  say the customer produced a coupon when he got to the house and since he knew how much it would be he just charged them that price, so we would change the order to reflect the coupon inclusion.  Depending on the coupon, he could make up to $6 or $7 additional per order.

Secondly, he would take deliveries out, get paid for them, then when he came back to the store he would edit the order to a pickup order rather than a delivery then pay for it himself.  This meant he got to keep the tip and the delivery fee, there's a free $3 per order.  We finally caught him doing this since the computer kept an audit trail - we had someone new working on the ovens one night and they placed the wrong pizzas in the wrong boxes for three different orders, all three of which he delivered (and changed), and all three of which called back to complain.  Oops.

"I think the biggest issue in that regard might be that the vast majority of those 15 years old would be in a state of constant WTF?! - hey no school! - masturbation everyday everywhere...for several months until food cans and other reserves run out and at that point anarchy would take other and presumebly also destroy any potential for large scale and efficient agriculture.

The question is whether a population of 15 year olds can learn to be (more or less) responsible adults faster than food runs out - or not. This might take a while since the at least in the west less than 20% of the population is under 15 (13% Germany, 18% France for example), in the 3rd world that portion is significantly higher but I also expect the kids there to accomplish a smoother transition."

She is a ""floating"" art teacher, meaning she hops between 3 schools to teach their art class for 1 hour each day. She literally teaches for 3 hours per day. She can kinda do whatever she wants outside of those 3 hours because each school just assumes she is at one of the others if she's not there. Her kids are younger elementary, so they're young enough to where they're still sweet and love their teachers. Plus, art class is fun for kids, so she rarely has behavior issues in her classes. She ""grades"" their work, but you could hardly call it grading. It is just something she is required to do, and it is essentially based on how much they tried. 

She still has to do the annoying requirements like lesson planning and writing reports.. but that isn't very much.

"Porn has very little to do with our relationship.  She was always a very sexual person, I just really liked her as a person and saw her get fucked over by too many guys to be another one in her life.  So we were always friends.

After high school she did a lot of alt porn and a few movies where she was nude.  She stripped and went on a few ""vacations"" with some clients.  I was always nervous for her doing that, but she's still alive so that's good.  Hearing her getting into risky situations is probably the worst part of our friendship.

She tried going to school a few times, but the money was always better in stripping so she always went back to it.  She mainly just strips now, and she wants her life a little more private.  She got into photography and changed her name professionally, but some Russian facebook posted all her old modeling pics with her new name. I gave her some legal advice how to get rid of that and it worked out. 

She moves a lot for work and after bad relationships. I see her a few times a year. She has a pretty good head on her shoulders, but the people she has met in the industry are a mess. She defends them, but a lot of them are escorts or sugar babies, so I have a very different perspective of their life decisions. Hearing about their lives is so far removed from the world I live in it's very interesting.  Those conversations are awkward."

"Every now and then in elementary school, I'd get tired of recess. One day I was in the in-class bathroom and heard the kids lining up to leave the classroom for recess. I decided to hang out in the bathroom until they left. And when I didn't hear anymore noises, I came out of the bathroom and into a dark empty classroom. That day I just kinda hung out in there and enjoyed every minute of it. I didn't turn the lights on but my creative little kid mind had a blast with the freedom. This little bit of freedom once in a while became addictive and I developed new ways to evade recess without detection. Sometimes I'd hide under a desk and watch the doorway and as a teacher would walk by, I'd make a loud noise or say something. The confused teacher would pause and look in and then walk away. Other times I'd rearrange stuff, turn things upside down, or steal colored pencils from my enemies. In our ""going out to recess"" line, I'd hang at the back and take a turn down a hall when no one would notice. I'd then go back to the empty classroom, or another classroom with no one around, and do whatever I wanted. I never did it frequently enough to get caught and the teacher didn't take roll call at the end of recess to round everyone up so this lasted the entirety of the school year. "

"Vne (Never exceed speed in aviation terms) for a B777 is Mach 0.89. Everything you'll ever read about a plane when it comes to speed, is based on airspeed. The speed of the air hitting the aircraft.

Now... what is displayed (usually) on those little monitors is ground speed. The speed at which you're moving relative to the ground. You could easily fly Mach 1 with a good tailwind.

Math time!

Since I know speeds in knots, let's put the speed of sound (Mach 1) at 667 knots. 

Your 777 might have been going Mach 0.85, which is very reasonable for a long flight in cruise. What that means is that you're 0.15 Mach away from the speed of sound.

Now, if there was absolutely *NO* wind where you were flying (AKA not really possible, especially in the jet stream), your ground speed and airspeed will be the same: Mach 0.85.

But this is the jet stream, for fuck's sake! Lots of wind. 

Now, to reach the speed of sound, you'll need another 0.15 Mach. That's approximately 100 knots. Wow. That's a lot.

At around 35,000 feet (end of Troposphere, beginning of Tropopause, and usual cruise altitude for longer flights), the jet stream is probably at it's most powerful (sorry, I can't be 100% for sure, I slept through Meteorology and Climates last semester). 

The jet stream's average wind speed is 185km/hr. 

What's that in knots?

100 knots.

You just broke Mach 1 across the ground, bud. Go brag to your friends. Just hope none of them actually understand aerodynamics or aviation or meteorology. "

"If a girl feels the need to tell you she has a boyfriend, whether she's lying or not, it's usually an attempt to get you to stop hitting on them because they feel there's no other out. 

Or perhaps you aren't hitting on them, but your behavior toward them isn't something they want. 

Trust me, pretend to take them on their word anyway and pay very close attention to their body language. It's frustrating, but ""I have a boyfriend"" is usually used (in my and my friends' experience) when a guy has no clue we don't want to talk. "

My mom and my sister were deciding what they wanted to see.  I piped up:  ""I heard Black Swan was really good.""

We all dispersed.  My nieces enjoyed the movie.  We all got back home later and I asked my mom how the movie was.  She made a face and said, ""There was a lot of sex in the movie.""  My sister later said out of earshot of my mom, ""Yeah, nothing like watching a movie with your mother with two women having sex.""  Also worth mentioning that my sister is gay. 

I felt terrible.  I never recommended a movie again without looking up a synopsis online, at least.

"Smaller slaughter houses do.

Big places don't waste anything at all.

Meat is muscle basically.

Heart lungs kidneys brain and guts etc are all offal.

Sometimes offal will go into speciality markets or products. (pate for example is offal)

Scottish haggis is offal. (minced lungs heart kidney in a stomach)

Intestines can be mashed and mixed for animal food. (offal is very good for dogs etc)

Once a carcase is butchered, meat goes to shops, prepackaged meals etc depending. The bones normally go into the flencer to strip them down. (kinda like a car wash made of steel brushes). That's your mechanically separated meat. 

Offal goes wherever it's needed then the bones themselves are used. (gelatin production, pharmaceuticals etc etc).

Almost nothing of a carcase is wasted. Even blood will be gathered and used (black pudding, sausage etc) or if you are working with significant tonnage you can ship them whole to a market where people aren't so delicate. (China loves pig heads and trotters for example)

Smaller speciality places by contrast are much more wasteful. (especially those eco friendly all natural shits) They don't have either the means or market to use offal or bone properly so just say they're eco friendly and shove everything they can't sell into an incinerator.

Fortunately they're normally small fry operators. Smarter ones are looking for partners to scale up where anyone will bother with them.

At one point we were asked to kneel, and my brother and I pulled out the kneeling pad and knelt on it. We were the only people kneeling in that entire church, and most of the people in there were Christian. My dad, understanding this irony, tried VERY hard to contain his laughter during the prayer, which made it very difficult to contain our laughter. Woops."

I never had a good explanation for why I did it so just pretended like I had no idea and never told her to this day. =/"

She's their mother, and almost certainly has a rough idea of their financial situation.

"I have 2, each one creepy/blood chilling in its own unique way. 

I was born and raised in the country outside a small northeastern Indiana ""town"". I lived in a house that my great-great-great-great grandfather and his brothers built, as well as 4 other homes directly around my house, where his brothers &amp; their wives lived back in their time. So, by the time I lived in it as a child, it was well into 100 years old, and had been remodeled by my grandma and grandpa in the 1970s. So before we lived there my maternal grandparents lived there, my grandpa was diagnosed with idiopathic cystic fibrosis of the lungs, way back in the early 1980's. I was born in 1989, and in 1990 he was blessed with receiving the first lung transplant in northern indiana. At a very young age I have two distinct memories of him being home, with oxygen tubes in his nose, and pulling his oxygen tank around the house to sit in his favorite rocker/recliner. He passed away in 1991 from rejection. So, the creepy part. Back in 2006, I was pregnant with my first child and near my due date. It was during the day and I was really uncomfortable and my hips/lower back was hurting. So I decided to drive to mom &amp; dads &amp; take a nap in their waterbed thinking the heat may help. So, I get there and mom &amp; I sat in the kitchen (off from the living room) to talk for a few minutes. During a lull in conversation, I distinctly hear a ""squeak...squeak"" like squeaky tires, I kind of nonchalantly look around to see where the noise could be coming from. I don't see anything. I glance at my mom and see she's looking around too. Right as I'm about to ask her if she hears that, I see from the corner of my eye a figure walk past the entryway to the kitchen, walking into the living room. Since I was already looking at mom (hense why I saw it out of the corner of my eye) I could see she def saw something as well as her eyes got that ""deer in headlights look"" and her face went pale. She looked at me and put her finger over her closed mouth like a ""shh"" sound, and we both stood up quietly and walked to the kitchen/living room hall/entryway, and looked into the living room. In the living room the rocker recliner mom had was rocking back and forth like someone was sitting in it rocking. I looked back at mom with a ""are you fucking seeing this?"" Expression just in time to see her hands fly up to her open mouth, I snap my head back around and plainly see my dead (for at this time 15+ years) grandfather (mom's dad) sitting in the chair, rocking, for about two rocks, I quickly glance back at mom to make sure she's seeing this, and look back an he was gone &amp; the chair was completely still. Legit freakiest thing that has ever happened to me, was not scared, was just in disbelief. So glad my mom was there or I would have thought I'd gone insane. 

Story 2, is completely different. So, lived in the same house except this time I was around 8/9 and my and my sisters rooms were upstairs in our house and my parents room was downstairs. This particular night I was sick and my parents let me sleep on the couch in the living room. Somewhere around 3/4a.m. I remember waking up because I heard someone come in the front door (which opens directly into the living room). I remember opening my eyes to see someone walking through the living room and into the kitchen. And I seemingly fell back asleep for a few minutes, the next thing I knew I was woken up to red &amp; blue lights flashing through the house. Then I hear my dad &amp; moms hushed whispers and dad arguing with what sounded like another man. Again young me, just fell back asleep. Come to find out the next morning. Apparently a man who was fleeing the cops had pulled into our driveway, and walked into our house (!!!!) and was trying to convince my dad to tell the cops he was his dad and this was his house. Uh yah dad def did NOT dothat and guy ended up in jail. "

"I moved in with my best friend and his family. I got a part time job that had the same shifts as him. Built myself up and climbed the retail ladder to become a front end manager. Then I had enough money to moved into a small apartment a few blocks away from that job. Then started talking communicating with my grandma, was given a car and money to obtain my pharmacy technician registration and certification which was way more than I could afford to pay with all my other expenses. So, after she helped me get my tech certificate and gave me a car, I moved in with her (due to her health) and worked in a pharmacy. I then started online school for pre-Pharmacy at a college located in the city of my job, almost done with that. Thank goodness. I pretty much made it a goal to prove the part of my family that 'disowned,' that I can make it without their support and that I can live up to my expectations, not theirs."

"Bingo. 116 hours in 14 days, covering his shifts on top of mine. 105 was paid at normal rate, only 11 qualified for overtime. The excuse given is that the weeks were not in sync with pay periods so I only worked 91 during the pay period. I'm not a lawyer but that makes no sense. I worked 3 weeks of shifts in a 2 week scheduling block. I don't quibble over a couple hours but this was 36 and it's a serious problem. When I cover for everyone every single time I'm asked, don't rip me off!

Just recently my boss forced our part-time guy to come to work when his son was headed to ER with a life-threatening condition because she refuses to ever cover for anyone - despite demanding I work 16-20 hour shifts so she can leave early for dates or her own mother's ER trips, etc.

I was also threatened (implicitly) with firing if I took the night off 3 weeks later for his memorial service - despite not taking any of my 3-5 day bereavement leave prior.

I received the same threat the other day when I announced I needed a day off to move to my new apartment, and again when I told boss I refused to walk 4-5 miles in the afternoon heat to work, then back home at 2am on roads with no sidewalks or shoulder, as their pay mistakes had prevented me from fixing my car before moving.

" &gt;“The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

&gt;Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

&gt;But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

&gt;This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.”

"Home care worker here. We see some fucked up shit caring for the elderly and disabled. I had this one house-a middle aged woman and her elderly mother, who made me sick to my stomach. 

I smelled the house from the driveway, a mix of animal and human shit with a side of decay. They were hoarders, and not just any kind either! They were food hoarders! My god, the smell on the inside made me gag when I stepped in the kitchen and I change adult diapers for a living. This shit was unholy. I cleaned up piles of food which had expired years ago, buckets of discarded piss and dozens of dead mice. The worst part was, they had a dog. That poor thing, they had a full grown cocker spaniel which wasn't allowed outside! Ever! I felt so bad for it, for years the dog went without fresh air or sunlight. They just let it shit on pads in the kitchen of all places and refused to let it out for fear it would run away. 

Not to mention my client, the elderly mother, was the poster child for assisted suicide. We became very close over the year I spent trying to help them get their lives together and repeatedly this poor old lady tried to off herself In increasingly creative ways. Shit broke my heart. In the end, I had to force adult protective services and the humane society to get them out of there. I couldn't do anything to fix that fuckery. The daughter was a former cop and had kept the authorities out for years, but after having them called out to the house for the 3rd time they finally believed me and checked the mother out. They were horrified. Needless to say, old lady and dog were out of there within the week. Fucked up part was, the dog got out first!

Still not sure how it caught, but I had a deck outside for entertainment (stereo, dance floor, open bar, etc) that I was throwing a birthday party at. Suddenly there's this massive inferno, and none of the sims standing around had the brave trait to put it out. The one guy that did couldn't get past the three panicking sims that died. The fireman showed up, but she couldn't get through either, so she jumped in my pool and watched the chaos unfold.

Worst. Birthday. Ever."

"When I was in high school, I was visiting a friends house and we walked by his parents in the kitchen playing a board game. I was stunned. My parents couldn't be in a room for 2 minutes without screaming at each other, so they avoided contact as much as possible. I was so used to this that when I saw my friend's parents, sitting quietly, enjoying each others company, it struck me how fucked up my parents were. I just couldn't wrap my head around seeing two married people hanging out, like friends.

I remember that moment so vividly I can even recall details like the pattern in the carpet, and the glass on the light fixture in the room.

My wife and I watch TV and chat a bit, but mostly we just tidy up the house after the kids go to sleep. By the time everything is finished, we just plop into bed and grab some sleep."

"That all snakes are dangerous. The worst is those who say that any snake is poisonous, which they cannot be. Poison and venom are both toxins, but they have different requirements you could say. 

Poison is ingested via wounds, mouth, eyes, nose, genitals, any hole in your body, including just your skin absorbing it. Venom is injected via a needle-like tube that penetrates the body and puts the toxin right into the blood stream.

Once people get that right, they need to realize that a majority of the snakes in captivity are non-venomous. The only venomous snake I can think of that is safe to keep even for a beginner reptile owner is a Western Hognose, and their venom is milder than a honeybee. 

After working retail in at pet store for a year and a half, and owning snakes for 13 years now, it just downright pisses me off that people will be ignorant like that. Like if you think all cats are fine, why are all captive snake not okay?"

"Several years ago I was at a New Year's Eve with a few friends, the couple in the apartment next door were taking turns popping in for drinks as they had a small child. At some point the dad came in with the baby in his arms and straight up kicked the girl in the face then tossed the kid at her (I shit you not). We made sure her and the baby were fine and went to his apartment and told the guy it was cool we were bringing over a joint to calm him down, we then circled him and beat the ever living piss out of him.

The fucked up part is we had to go to court as witnesses (she charged him with assault the cops actually seemed proud of us) and she dropped the fucking charges."

"&gt; They're too different from each other. 

But that's the thing. They are *not* different from each other. They're both natural leaders. They like taking action. They both hide their vulnerability with tough exteriors, Han with his overdone independence and roguish attitude, and Leia with her royal haughtiness.

The thing that makes them different is the environments they were raised in. Leia in royalty and Han in the opposite of that. The fact they get on with each other so well (by the end of ROTJ) despite such different backgrounds shows how well matched they are. And Han's character development to the point of rising to General means that even their different social situations is largely gone by that point.

Frankly, TFA story of what happened to them is the least believable bit of the whole romance. Especially Han just reverting to a nobody. Even if he wanted to it would have been hard with his important position in the defeat of the empire."

"My extremely dumb ""friend"" from high school found his grandfather's gun, which was unloaded. But he didn't think to check for a bullet in the chamber, and was holding the gun on me to scare me - he liked to do shitty stuff like that to people. He was a bit of an asshole.

All I could think about was how dumb he was. It wasn't at all out of the question that he might pull the trigger to ""scare me,"" because I kept trying to explain the concept of a bullet being in the chamber, but, again... he was dumb. He didn't get it, and thought I was just making shit up to get him to stop.

Eventually he figured he'd fucked with me enough, and put the gun away.

"I don't have any really horrific stories, we're super thorough in screening our tenants but once in a while we inherit a bad one or one slips through the safety net. Some examples:

We had a couple whose relationship was falling apart and they took it out on everything and everyone. They made daily noise complaints about shit like, their upstairs neighbours are walking too loudly. They would bang on the walls to get the upstairs tenants to quiet down (???) And this would spurn actual noise complaints from other tenants. They fought and screamed at each other all the time and several times other tenants thought they heard physical abuse. Before they moved in, they loved everything about the apartment, after a few months though, everything was wrong...they eventually did a midnight run.

Another tenant that we inherited was fine when he was working but would just sit at home and drink if he was off for more than a few days at a time. He complained that none of his radiators were working. All but one were actually working he just didn't want to turn on any others and demanded we get a plumber out at 11pm to fix one rad so he could have heat again. Another time, the boiler failed during the coldest week of the year and he of course complained about the cold. What he didn't mention was that his living room window was wide open for ""fresh air"" and he refused to close it. When we were doing repairs to the exterior brick he called the departments of labour and environment daily so inspectors were at the building every single day for a month.

We rented an apartment to someone but on the way out the door, the previous tenant trashed the place. We offered another apartment to the new tenant or to refund her money and cancel the lease but she insisted this was the apartment she wanted and she would wait the week we needed to fix it up. Two months later she started complaining that the apartment was unlivable because of what the previous tenant did and demanded we pay her to move out.

"I made my wife do a cost-benefit analysis with me when she was questioning vaccines. I had her look up the chances of contracting the disease\* and the rates of each of the symptoms (including death). Then we scaled the severity of each symptom from 1 to 10. On the other side of the ledger, I had her look up the incidence of vaccine side effects\*\*, which we also scaled. 

Then it was a simple optimization. I don't remember the exact results but the math worked out to something like a million to one in favour of the vaccine.

_________________________________________
\* We used the incidence rate before the vaccine was introduced. The argument was about the relative merits of the vaccine itself, not whether we should piggy-back off herd immunity.

I picked it up to see what the notification was, and it was a friend request, from her. Up until that point, I had never even spoken to this chick. Never. I was so confused. Does this mean she wants to be friends? She was literally just sitting right next to me. Why didn't she strike up a conversation? Then it struck me. This chick has had Facebook or MySpace basically her entire life. She probably has had a cell phone since she was 10. And I doubt she ever uses it to make phone calls.

"Yeah this is why I don't really take vegan's ethical arguments seriously. Sure, we should stop factory farming, keeping animals in conditions similar to prison camps, and there is a sound environmental reasoning to eat less meat, and the fact that we care for dogs and cats yet eat pigs and cows is an hypocrisy. However, beyond that I really don't care. Nature is brutal, while we shouldn't take it upon ourselves to be worse than nature, don't be so naive to think animals would give you the same quarter as you would, you're edible too. 

I stand behind sustainable farming, hunting, consumption, and conservation of wildlife, but to somehow think that eating meat, as a whole, is immoral is lunacy."

I can tell by the way you said that, that you don't really understand national debt and you are thinking about it from a personal debt perspective (they aren't the same). The national debt is only a problem when we default on a payment. Which has never happened in the entire history of the United States.

"My friend and his dad are volunteer firefighters. I was staying the night and they got a call at 1 AM. They knew it would be a long call based off of info from their radios, so I went with them. According to a witness, a Motorcyclist going about 120 mph was going around a wet corner at midnight passed a semi truck. He leaned too much into the corner, slid across the road (still on his bike), hit a tree (he disengaged from his bike when he hit the tree) and skidded in front of the semi, where the semi smeared him like spreading peanut butter on toast. I stayed in the truck with the windows down, but could see everything due to all the flashing lights. Semi driver was a wreck, crying and sobbing, saying that it happened so fast that he couldn't do anything. I got to watch my friend and his dad scrape a guy off the road. Drive safe guys, esp.

"I live in the south, had a comprehensive sex ed class. Two of them, one in the 3rd grade, one in the 7th. The first was on the biological aspects, then later we went over things like the social aspects of sex and such. I believe females had an additional few ""classes"" or assemblies in 9th grade for topics like teenage pregnancy and breast cancer screening. The classes did include abstinence but also safe sex, contraceptives, where to get them, how to use them, etc.. 

I feel like the majority of people who lived in the South and say they had an abstinence only education come from poor or small schools. There are schools in some places where the graduating class size is less than 10 people. My roommate graduated with 12 people in his class and had less than 20 people in his elementary school. In both cases, 1 person was his brother and another was his cousin. I think they just straight up don't have the resources to give them a proper education or the people on the school board are just folks without much education themselves since they don't exactly have a lot of candidates.

"Approximately 2% of the population will have their minds blown by the fact that when people speak of visualizing things in their head, or seeing things in their minds eye, picturing specific things, all that sort of stuff, that other people actually see something, and that's not actually just a metaphor or anything.

It's called Aphantasia(literally - the Absence of Fantasy), and seriously, it spins you right the fuck out when you find out you have it and the world doesn't function quite the way you absolutely thought it did.

A smaller percentage of the remaining 98% find it a bit mind-blowing that some other people don't see things. Or don't Pseudo-see things, I suppose.

"Probably no one will read this, but whatever. I'm going to complain about the Trace.

**First, one minor nitpick:** Hermione uses magic outside of school in the first book and doesn't get into trouble. When we first see her on the train, she mentions trying simple spells at home, and they all worked, of course.

This doesn't gel with what we learn at the end of the book (underage wizards/witches can't use magic outside of school). And since Harry gets in trouble in the beginning of the second book for a Hover Charm, we know that the rule *is* enforced. So why wasn't Hermione given a warning, as well?

Most obvious answer: She did, but she didn't mention that part. The problem with this answer is that Hermione, especially in the beginning of the first book, is hell-bent on following the rules. She even thinks being expelled is worse than dying. I find it unlikely she would have been willing to break this particular rule, especially because I would imagine that the Ministry folks who contacted her and her family would have been very explicit on the necessity of keeping magic a secret. No way would Hermione be willing to risk expulsion just to try a couple cantrips.

Another possible explanation is that they don't really enforce the rules for students who haven't even attended their first year at Hogwarts. I find this equally improbable. Secrecy is paramount to the wizarding community, and the greatest threat of that secret coming out is likely first-year muggle-born students and their families. If anything, the Ministry would be *more* strict with her at that age, not less. Keep in mind that wizard society is prejudiced against muggle-borns in the first place.

**Now, for the bigger one.**

The Trace is broken. Harry gets in trouble in CoS because Dobby frames him by casting a Hover Charm. Yet it wasn't Harry casting the spell, nor was it his wand. From this we can deduce that the Trace only works by detecting magic in use *around* underage wizards.

This is broken on two levels:

1. It's basically unenforceable in wizard homes, since the Trace would be going off all the damn time whenever an underage kid is around family members who are allowed to do magic whenever they please.

2. It would be trivial to frame an underage wizard and get them kicked out of school. What's to stop Lucius Malfoy, infuriated that Harry cost him his house elf, from showing up at Number 4, Privet Drive and slinging spells around until Harry gets expelled? He could even use Harry's wand (*accio Harry's wand!*) to do the spells so that *priori incantatem* would ""prove"" Harry cast the spells.

Assuming anyone reads this, I anticipate a couple objections to my scenario in #2. First, know that it's one potential scenario; if for some reason you don't think Malfoy could enter the Dursleys' home, substitute any other wizard with any other underage wizard, especially an underage wizard living in a muggle home. Second, Malfoy could easily intercept Harry somewhere other than the house and frame him there.

*Finally,* one other thing that bothers me but isn't necessarily a plot hole. How does the Trace not recognize house elf magic? It's established in one of the books that house elves use different magic than wizards. This is why they can apparate all around Hogwarts while humans can't. And note that it's stated in the book that their magic *is* different; it's not some exemption given to house elves. The anti-apparation enchantment simply doesn't work on them.

So why does the Trace even think Harry performed the Hover Charm, even though it was a house elf doing it?

*Finally finally*, I've always wondered how and when the Trace gets applied. Is it just some broad-area effect? As far as I know, we never see any other example of an enchantment that doesn't need to specifically target a person or a thing. Why don't we see this type of thing used more often?"

"The term comes from an example of designing a nuclear power plant: ask everyone for ideas, and most people will shrug or say ""I'm sure it's fine"". This is because they understand that nuclear power plants are extremely complicated and they assume that whatever questions or ideas they might have, will have already been addressed by someone far, far more qualified to deal with the topic. If the expert says it should be 100 feet high, then they figure there must be a very good reason that it isn't 99 feet or 101 feet. However, even non-expert opinions might have some value here, because of the immense scale of the project. If there's a one in a million chance that the designers haven't considered your random thought (""What happens if it gets hit by lightning? What happens if someone accidentally locks themselves out of the control room? What happens if a squirrel fills this satellite dish with acorns?"") then congratulations, that brain turd is worth thousands of dollars.

But then you ask for thoughts on designing the bike shed outside the power plant, and everybody suddenly has an opinion. ""It should be green. It should be red. It should be open on the south side. It should be ten feet long. It should be twelve feet long. The racks need to hang from the ceiling."" and so forth and so on, because the bike shed is something they can more or less comprehend fully. Ultimately, though, it doesn't really matter very much, and the bike shed is trivial to replace if it turns out that real-world testing reveals areas of improvement."

I really don't know if she was purposefully lying, or if she truly believed in the lies she told. 

I do feel bad for her. It's clear she wants to be interesting, to have lots of friends and to be loved, but she creates this persona that's a bit too good to be true and involves way too much effort to maintain. Once I found out that the person I met wasn't actually her, I felt betrayed and lied to. Sadly, this seemed like a common occurrence with her past friends, which again makes me feel bad for her. At the same time, it's hard to maintain any relationship where you feel you can't trust the other person. "

"Guy in a big city goes up a skyscraper to the swanky bar at the top. He sits down at the bar and orders a drink. Another guy sits down and orders a glass of wine, a pint of beer and a shot of whiskey. He downs each one in turn, then suddenly gets up, runs to a window and jumps.

""AAAAAAAHHH""*thump*

A few minutes later the same man walks back into the bar, completely unharmed. First guy says to him ""How the hell did you survive that?!""

""You saw me order the glass of wine, the pint of beer and the shot of whiskey, right? Well, if you down them in that order like I did, you'll become invincible!""

First guy wouldn't have believed it if he hadn't seen it, so he orders the glass of wine, the pint of beer and the shot of whiskey. He downs them all, runs to the window and jumps.

""AAAAAAAHHH""*splat*

The bartender looks at the other guy and says ""You're an asshole when you drink, Superman."""

My cousin's wife comes from an extremely wealthy family. My cousin was raised by his single mother who worked her butt off to give him the world. He is well educated and well traveled because his mother is a rock star. His wife has all but cut my aunt off from her son and their kids because she's been divorced. She's now all alone besides my family who has adopted her as another grandma but she longs for her son and grandchildren.

"Because he constantly states his opinion on how he hates transgender and gay people and how he will always misgender and insult them even though he rants about how intolerant some people are. Then in class he always blurts out comments on guns even when it has nothing to do with what we're talking about. Afterwards, he always jokes about how he's gonna murder and rape women then leave their bodies behind in the woods. He even went as far as yelling that he was horny, grabbing me, and pretending to rape me in front of all my classmates right before class started. Plus, he used to touch me on ""accident"" until I caught on. But you know, I ain't no snitch."
"This is big one. You can be the nicest person but I can't follow that lifestyle as I am lean and super healthy. Now that sounds horrible but let me explain:

Recently I had a thing with a guy. He wasn't the healthiest, borderline between normal and overweight. Pretty face and beautiful blue eyes. We are both gay where the body matters a lot, but I liked him a lot and our personalities naturally clicked. HOWEVER we had huge arguments over anything health. For one he didnt go to the gym and I did which cut on our free time together by a lot. If I tried to plan anything at all like hiking he would always wake up late and ruin the day's activity. We had restaurants nearby and he would always want to order delivery where I prefer to walk to the restaurants, breath some air, and pay less.

Oh the food. When we went out to eat he always opted for shitty options like McDonald's. What's romantic about that? I always put my foot down and opted for more trendy healthy restaurants with variation. As a result I footed the bill most of the time. My meals went from $5 to $10 as single  to $20 to $50 as a couple. That is just insane.

Eating at home. I always wanted simple things like chicken and a salad with water or milk. He wanted to try fancy recipes that always ended with obscene quantities of meat and carbohydrates, no fruits or veggies, plus soda. He would get offended if didn eat his food, I would get offended by the shit he called food. 

Otherwise we were perfect, but he ended up moving since we are both in our early 20's. But seriously I can't put up with that shit again. We have to be on the same page on health even if we like different foods. I can overcome the lack of a perfect body, I can't deal with an unhealthy life style. Never again.

"I'm a nursing student; but I would love to share this story that the GI doctor told me on my last clinical rotation in endoscopy.

A gentleman came into the ER/ED with a simple request.  ""Can you get this orange juice glass out of my ass?  I can't seem to get it out.""  Seems to be a fair request.  Nurses/Doctors of the unit glove up and take a look.  Well, he decided the best way to sit on said glass was open side up... in other words, plenty of suction was going on.  Nobody could remove this glass because it was placing TOO much suction on his bowel, risking the potential of a perforation or a very, very severe anal prolapse.  

So this guy is screaming at the nurses and doctors, ""How hard is it to get an OJ glass out of my asshole, huh?!""  (Sorry buddy, but we're trying to be patient with you... normally, people don't sit on glassware.  Give us a second).  Doc gives a sedative in the OR.  They have to physically break the glass.  The glass breaks. *Shit* (expletive and literal, unfortunately).  Blood... Hemorrhage?  Nope.  Doctor's hand gets sliced on a piece of glass.  GI doc is pissed; probably worried about what he's going to catch from this guys corn-hole.  Glass removal ensues.  The rest of the procedure is successful.

The whole thing was a shit show, really."

"He really wasn't though. How he got elected was pretty off, specifically referred to as the ""Southern Strategy"". Because of the desegregation laws enforced by the Democrats at the time, Nixon appealed to white conservatives in the Deep South, which inevitably included a lot of racists. This was just to gain victory, and he never planned to fulfill any of the things these people wanted done. As you said, he strictly enforced desegregation laws anyway. Whatever your political beliefs, he did mislead many people voting for him.

As just a additional fun fact, this in time shifted these people's votes from traditionally Democrat, to Republican. This in time changed the sort of people running as and getting elected as Republicans, altering the policies of the Republican Party, eventually allowing the election of Reagan and leading to the GOP we know today.

I actually find Nixon, in terms of personality, one of the most fascinating presidents. He was awkward, and more introspective and shy than other presidents. He doubted himself greatly, and believed distance from people was key. Even his best friend didn't call him by his first name."

"Put up with a two face bitch of a foster sister for like 10 years too long. Stupid, thieving, self-centred cow who only pretended to be my friend so she could get me to do her chores/ homework...She'd took my best calculator from my room with her to her SATS where she wrote her several crushes names in tip-ex all over it (it was a scientific calculator that had like 200 buttons and was pretty pricey at the time- my biological dad got it me when I was 10) I needed it for my GCSE's which I think are more important an exam than her bullshit. She insulted my dad saying he aught to rot in a nuthouse (he's the only parent that gave a damn about me) so I punched her for it.
But what really made me hate her guts and say 'Fuck it, I'm done pretending to like you' was when she stole from me. I've mentioned it before, but to make it short, I was in Uni and needed the £40 for a good food shop and train ticket back to Uni. She took it and bought a sweater she never wore. When foster mum asked her where it came from (she was flat broke at the time) she said her boyfriend got it her. He hadn't. Plus there was the receipt for it.

I got a safe installed in my bedroom because of her and like a year later while shopping for graduation clothes, she tried to get me to tell her my PIN for my card. I told her to fuck off. After that point I was counting down the days until she got her own place. Each time she wanted to 'hangout' I told her that she's a worthless piece of scum and I'd rather get hit by a car than put up with her lies and thieving.

I refuse to have any kind of interaction with her, and she still visits us, scrounging for cash. I stay in my room until she goes off to be a fat thief somewhere else. I don't regret it, but I do regret ever trusting her even a little."

I told her to publically admit she was lying to her friends as I wasn't dating her and after her lying wouldn't see myself in the future. She cried, a supervisor rushed over and sent me to the principals office. I was told I had to apologize to her, in front of her parents, for saying harmful things to her while she didn't have to do anything despite lying and slandering my name by associating me with her. I was extremely edgy and refused, even told her parents that they shouldn't raise a daughter who feels the need to lie to get acceptance by her peers.

My coworker and I both have terrible MILs. We always complained to each other because we 'got it' and it's hard to talk to your husband about it because they clearly love their parent and their parent treats them well.

One day she turns to to me and says ""I know I am going to hate my future daughter in law because no matter who she is or what she does she will never be good enough for my baby"". 

My response: ""So basically you want to be your mother in law?""

Her eyes got really big and she was horrified that she would act the way our MIL would without even knowing who he was possibly ever going to meet, he was in middle school at the time and years away from being that serious with anyone. I am pretty sure that is the mentality of my own mother in law."

But I have a buddy that has an even weirder situation. He grew up in Tunisia, where he learned French, Arabic and a mixture of French and Arabic. Then he went to college in Russia (don't ask...) where he learnt Russian and English. Then he moved to Poland and learned *some* Polish. Watching him talk with his family over the phone is honestly the most hilarious experience I've had when it comes to languagesa. He just freely drifts between all those languages: one second it's all the Arabic shhh and ashhh, then Russian comrades, French nobelty, English phrases here and there plus the occasional Polish word.

Kinda dumb.

The maze should've been the first, then the dragon, then the lake, it would have made more sense. Whoever completed the maze first would allow you to choose which type of dragon in descending order, with the Horntail as the least desirable, and the Welsh Green as the most desireable. Then, the people would be ranked, have to figure out the clue of the lake, then would get five extra minutes for each level above last they are at to find the cup in the middle of the lake somewhere.

Luckily I had my brother tag along 6'5 240 in case anything were to happen as the client did threaten me over the phone. The client handed my brother the money as I said I was leaving if I wasn't paid first. (My brother use to work for the guy).

This client also has a video of his shady business from a leading news network from a disgruntled employee who he most likely screwed over just like almost all his employees he is currently screwing over.

For example he has a architect on his roster who had severe depression when the client took him in, paying him less than minimum wage as the architect just wanted to get out of the house. A year later and the guy has overcome his depression wants to negotiate fair pay but the client makes it extremely difficult. Kind of makes the architect feel like he owes him something.

"A friend of mine from high school recently transitioned to female.  Which is cool with me, I'm glad she's happy.  Except... apparently she's not.  Because she always posts about how she's so ugly and how she hates herself (which dysphoria is hard, I understand) but she also is in a polyamorous relationship, so she has 2 girlfriends to say this to!  You don't have to fish for compliments on facebook!  Other than that, she posts pictures of herself in bondage gear, talks about doing porn, posts pictures of her naked body all over the place, posts her dreams (every single one), posts pictures of her face with captions like ""i'm so ugly lol kill me"", talks about how she's so emo, and posts pictures of her making out with her girlfriends.  

Not to mention it's clear that no one has told her how to do make-up so she always looks punched in the face and she wore a sports bra to a wedding, so no one's told her she doesn't dress appropriately either.  But unfortunately, we're not close enough that I can tell her and even if I did, I would be called transphobic for going against her in any way (since that's the type of person she is.)"

"&gt;I mean how difficult can it really be to get a person's body to not absorb the calories in food without it being super dangerous?

I mean, people could just eat less instead.

I think there is something profoundly disturbing about deliberately trying to waste food like that. You want to lose weight but don't want to stop eating so much. The food isn't going to magically go away - you are going to defecate massive amounts instead. 

Thats what some of the current pills do - they inhibit the absorption of fat. This fat has to go somewhere and that becomes out in the form of greasy stools and anal leakage.

Appetite suppressants would be preferable so you wouldn't be so frivolously wasting resources because you're a glutton. "

"Electrical engineer:

The 3rd prong is for grounding, so that any metal surfaces or pieces you may come in contact with are at the same potential as the earth. This forces current to go through the 3rd prong instead of you. As devices switch to plastic enclosures, manufacturers are favoring 2 prong systems when they can get away with it. That is usually fine, but if a device has a grounding prong broken off/not used, you're putting yourself at risk to get shocked.

Someone mentioned it's so the device can short itself to the panel too, which is correct. If a device is defective, you want it to short cleanly and quickly, so the breaker/fuse trips/blows. If it doesn't, you can touch a metal surface as have as much as 14, 19 or 29 amps pump through you, and not trip the breaker. It takes no more than .1 amp to kill you. "

"I see people say this all the time and I really don't agree. The nature of the puzzles in portal 1 and portal 2 are so different because of how many more tools you have to work with in portal 2. 

In portal 1 you just had portals, cubes and the laser balls. That was it. You could put portals anywhere because the puzzle was ""where can I put these portals to navigate this environment in such a way that I reach the exit"". 

In portal 2 you have all of the same stuff as in portal 1 (well, with lasers replacing energy balls) but also the gels, light bridges, excursion funnels etc. Portals weren't used so much for navigating the environment anymore and instead they were a means of manipulating these new tools. It wasn't a question of ""how can I reach the exit with these portals"" and instead one of ""which portal positions can I pair with which tool at which time in order to achieve the desired result"". There might only have been a few places you could put portals but that was what made the puzzles difficult. You had to be turning gel pipes on and off, blocking things with bridges, carrying things with funnels and working out how to do all of it with very limited options for where to put your portals.

Imagine how laughably easy the puzzles in portal 2 would be if you could put repulsion gel or excursion funnels anywhere you wanted. This is also what makes the moments where you get to use conduction gel so exciting. With so many tools at your disposal the freedom to put them anywhere feels incredible.

TL;DR Very different types of puzzle being judged by the same standards. "

"Depends on the condition. I'm a guitar tech and would have to see pictures. The $300 is a waste of money on it. The value would remain the same as its ""as picked from dumpster"" value. Even in completely rebuilt, refinished, and redone condition they go for untold tens of thousands.  

It's not so much the value of the heritage, brand name, features, paint, or hardware on the original '59 les paul  that makes them worth money - it was the wood they were made from.  

All les paul models made in 59 were made from a single Korina tree - and that singular massive tree is known for having produced the single greatest batch of tonewood known to man.  

You could completely bring it down to a raw body and neck - and it is still worth a fortune - solely because you would be holding a piece of the most desirable tone wood the human race has ever carved.  

Edit; so people understand the Les Paul guitar itself - and why it is so popular - it is because of the 59 series, and that singular tree. The only reason why this guitar has been so successful, and why every 12 year old guitarist wants one - is because every professional guitarist wants a 59 les paul.  

Modern les pauls, in my own opinion, are crap. It doesn't matter how much you pay for it - if its not a 59, its just another guitar.  

Gibsons success is entirely based on the 59 les paul legacy. Nothing more, nothing less. They make decent guitars, but there are far better instruments available from other brands, for a much better price.  

Fun fact; I'm sure anyone reading this knows about the guitarist Slash, of guns and roses? I'm sure anyone who knows of him, knows of his les paul guitars? He has 3 you see on stage. All 3 are branded Gibson. None of those 3 are real Gibson guitars - and are in fact handmade custom guitars, that have a Gibson decal set applied - so that slash can rake in the royalties from Gibson to show off their guitars. Gibson had nothing to do with the production of those instruments. "

I had a truck behind me on the road so I wasn't too scared (was already afraid of aliens before this). I kept my eyes in the rear view, keeping my eyes on this truck since I was hopelessly lost. Out of no where the truck is no longer behind me. There was no where for it to go. It disappeared in seconds. My car immediately died, battery on my phone completely drained, and I was stranded on this desolate back road. The only light available was the moon. About that time an alien walked in front of my car. It just stood there. Same exact description that you gave. I watched it for an eternity. Once it crossed the road my car finally cranked back up and I was able to get my phone on. NO ONE believes me. I will not walk off my back porch at night time. I do not get in my car alone at night unless I'm leaving work, and I always have my phone on my car charger (not that that would've mattered) l. You are not alone man!!  "

I looked straight back at him and said ""I'd definitely date him over you.""  I think he was shocked I actually said something back, then got really pissed. 

He picked up the jar of crickets and dumped them on me. I jumped up and am trying to get them off.

"Common law marriage is still alive and well in Alabama!  That means you can be legally married and not even know it!  

Surely, you think, it takes an effort to become common law married.  You have to live together for months or years, right? NO!  Stay at a hotel in Alabama with your SO for one night under a married name (Mr. and Mrs. Smith) and you may find yourself common law married!  

Well, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but not too much.

If my recollection is correct (I'm not jumping onto Westlaw for you people), you only have to prove capacity (that everyone is old enough and mentally sound enough to enter into a marriage), an agreement to enter into a marriage (which can be proven simply through testimony, even disputed testimony), and public recognition of the marriage, which usually involves some evidence of cohabitation.  Hit those three targets and you've got a legally binding marriage that will require a divorce to end!

In reality, most decent judges want significant evidence of cohabitation and an intent to be married (such as filing joint tax returns and sharing bank accounts under the same last name), but a bad judge may not give a poop.  It's silly to have common law marriage these days, but such is Alabama."

"You are right in theory, but the analogy between Vicodin and Heroin is off and is a misconception created by drug laws designed to incarcerate those in the inner city versus more wealthy users. Cocaine and crack are the exact same drug just converted into a different state. The reaction with baking soda coverts it from powder salt form to free-base solid form. Whereas hydrocodone and heroin are two completely different chemicals derived from the same source plant.

The difference between crack and powder cocaine is all attributed toward route of administration. Smoking is a much more efficient route than snorting due to the surface area of the aveoli tissue in the lungs. A better comparison to heroin would be the difference noted when snorting powder heroin vs smoking black tar. It's very common misconception for a number of reasons, hoped to just clear that up a bit."

Both people could want kids, but if one person wants a kid by a certain age, or due to biological clock, and the other person is more practical and the couple's financial situation or careers aren't really favorable to a kid at that time, it can create some problems.

It could be that you're 25 and want to enjoy your 20s child-free before having a kid, or into your 30s and maybe some setbacks don't have you as far as you'd like or need to be before choosing to have a child.

"Because the other sports are things that people get into when they are young. Ice hockey is expensive and unrelateable to a large portion of the population. Anyone can go out to a park and play basketball most of the year, and indoor gyms are easy to find for when the weather is bad. Football can be played in pretty much any weather. Baseball can be played for 6+ months a year. Hockey on the other hand can only be played for like 2-3 months a year and only in certain areas of the country. Otherwise, you need to maintain an ice rink which is crazy expensive. The cost of an ice rink makes it so that they are few and far apart. As a result, the youth just don't get into hockey the way they do into other sports because it isn't accessible. Then they grow up liking the other sports and not giving a fuck about hockey. It is the same reason why the Winter Olympics are much less popular than the Summer Olympics."

Especially when your siblings are treated differently. What a distraction it is when you reach 40 and suddenly realize your parents only raised your oldest brother and youngest sister and the reason you existed was to give your siblings someone they could always beat so they would develop a lot of confidence.

"Sexuality, STD prevention and contraceptive options. People need to grow up learning about sex in a way that promotes mutual respect and confidence, without stigmata that prevent it from being a fun, natural, healthy thing that people do with whomever they want, whenever they both (or all) want. There is far too much religion and dogma tied up in sexuality currently."

"To add to that it's weird that we basically determine about 85% of your life off of your high school performance. Just how well you perform in 4 years when you're a hormonal mess determines what class you're going to live in for the next 70 years.   
  
For top schools its dramatically easier to not get kicked out of a program than it is to get into one. You could be the best student community college has ever seen, but you're still at a major disadvantage to the dumber kid that buckled down in HS. There's no redoing high school either. "

"Friend's friend raped me while at a boozy frat party my freshman year of college. I didn't see her for a while after (had been visiting from out of state) and didn't know how to broach the subject, was also in denial about what had happened so when I finally brought it up, I semi laughed it off and claimed it was a molestation (it wasn't). Anyway, fast forward a few months later, it's my birthday and we're all merry and she mentions him. Being drunk I say something like ""that shithead raped me, I don't want to hear his name"" and she proceeds to say (completely sober) ""first of all, you weren't raped, you were molested"" and secondly, ""yea, he did a shitty thing to you, but he's still a good guy"" and wouldn't fucking let it go. So now I'm very upset, intoxicated, and arguing with my friend defending the guy who raped me, at my own goddamn birthday party. My small party of close friends all previously aware of my situation remained silent, rather than contribute to the discord or take sides. I know my little group isn't much into confrontation, but that one still hurts today. :(

"A few weeks ago I was up late celebrating the end of exams with some video games. I was living with my mom and my 96 year old grandpa until school wrapped up. My grandpa regularly gets up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom or get a glass of water, and when he does so his feet make a light *thud* sound that I can hear from the basement. 

So this night, around 2am I hear grandpas feet hit the floor, practically on schedule. About 30 seconds later I hear a much louder *THUD*. I knew that wasn't normal so I ran upstairs to see what had happened, thinking he had knocked over a chair or something. 

He actually collapsed. When I turned on the light he was lying on his stomach trying to get up. I went over to help him up and my mom came downstairs to investigate. I sat him down in a chair and he was somewhat responsive (well, as responsive as you can be when you're hearing is almost completely gone.) for about 15 seconds. Then he started convulsing and soiling himself and doing this odd lip smacking thing. I recognized it as a seizure and told mom to call 911 while I tried to tend to him. He was convulsing for about 30 seconds before he stopped and started gasping for air, each breath taking longer than the last, until he stopped breathing. Right there in my arms he just stopped breathing. I watched his lips turn blue, I couldn't find a pulse, and I watched the colour flush from his face. And I froze. I had no idea what to do at all. I was relaying all this to my mom to tell the 911 operator, and mom was losing her shit. 

The 911 operator told me to lay him down on the ground because she was gonna walk me through CPR. So I pick him up clean out of the chair, all 175 pounds of dead weight and lay him on the ground and get ready to do CPR. And just before I start, he opens his eyes and starts breathing again. The ambulance got there not long after, and I'm shouting at him trying to keep him calm and awake (did I mention he's almost deaf?). By the time he was in the stair chair he was joking with the paramedics that it's too cold to be outside in his pj's. 

He doesn't remember anything between when he went down and when he was being loaded into the ambulance. I envy him for that, because it's something I'll never forget. "

"we had a ""little person"" kid, I am not sure what the medical term would be, but we called him a dwarf (not in an offensive way, he was very popular). He was like tyrion lannister from GoT.

Anyway, a lot of times people would pick him up and put him on a low roof for shits and giggles. He would play up to it of course, and then teacers would come, tell him to get down (of course he could not) and then bring him down with a ladder. The fucked up part was that he would always be the one to get into trouble for it. He had no choice in going up there at all, although he did not exactly object. The people who decided to do it never got into trouble.

"We hadn't met the groom more than twice before the wedding. Our friend had moved out of state and so we didn't see them often. My husband is an artist and our friend asked him to draw a picture of the two of them, just a simple sketch to make copies of to use as a coloring sheet for kids at the wedding. He'd given me an odd vibe when we'd seen him before, but I was wrapped up in visiting with my friend who I didn't get to see enough, so I figured I just didn't know him well enough. When my husband and I went to hand him the copies before the wedding he was very curt and emotionless. As we were about to leave the room it was like a light went on and he graciously thanked us for the picture and thanked us for making the trip. It was as if he was an alien that remembered he had to act like a human. I had a terrible feeling, but who stops a wedding and says, I don't know this guy, but he acted funny a minute ago so stop the wedding?! Within a few months of the wedding he became violent and threw her out of the house because her hair clogged the shower. She came back to get her things and he'd thrown them out in giant garbage bags with ""cunt"" and ""whore"" written on them. He bugged her car and began to show up places he knew she'd be so that she'd be intimidated out of events she wanted to attend of places she wanted or needed to go. He even made a scene at her office. She changed her name to throw him off her scent. When she ran into his parents right after he'd thrown her out, she broke down and told them what was going on. They told her they were sorry, but he'd done this to a previous wife. They didn't say anything because they'd hoped he'd changed. 

The whole lot of them are sociopathic. This was a few years ago and she's doing great. Very happy, healthy and thriving, but I worry she may never feel like she can be with someone again :/

Tl/dr- got a weird sociopath vibe from the groom on the day of the wedding, turns out he was a sociopath."

"All that I really have are my past memories and the shadow of who I once was. I'm a loser now and have no future as an adult so I can only look backwards when I'm alone at night on a Saturday after midnight in my dark room, debating whether or not I should drink before I jerk off. I have serious doubts about my future since I'm now near-certain that I won't have one and that I am probably going to commit suicide or I will lead a very sad and horrible life as an adult. I know that there is nothing that I can do to lead a happy life and even a decent life of some comfort looks like a tough thing for me to pull off given who I am and what I've become. For me, the regrets about the past aren't so much about how I screwed up and did something wrong but rather how I just have bad luck in life and things didn't work out for me when I was a teenager and then throughout college. I lost nearly everything that made me happy due to ugliness once puberty kicked in and to my health problems that developed when I was about 13 or 14 years old. There used to be a time when I could run like the wind, excel at sports, play music beautifully, and had good friends who were all of the popular kids in high school and then in college. They left me behind while they went on to live great lives throughout their teen and college years and now they're leaving me behind as we all become adults. The only thing I have are my memories of how life was for me when we were all just kids and were best friends before puberty and my health issues kicked in and I lost them for good.

I stay up past 2 AM every night staring at my computer screen while doing nothing but think about how I don't want to go to sleep. I know that if I go to sleep each night after the sad and hopeless day that I have over and over then I will have lost another day of my life in the ""prime years"" of life. For me, my prime was when I was a kid and had my childhood. Now, I am kept awake at night by the pain and sadness that comes from not being able to or wanting to leave my past behind while also having to face down my sad present and even sadder future as a failed adult who has no hope in life. I have no decent or happy place in the present or future and the past is gone outside of my mind and memory. At least once a month I binge on social media stalking of my former friends since I never see or hear from them anymore. I feel more numb than upset when I see that one of them is engaged or that one of them has a new job and that they are out celebrating with the guys that I used to be friends with and with girls that never looked at me for a second during college where I was a ghost on campus. It hurts because I know deep down that on the inside I am as interesting, cool, and capable as they are yet my health issues and terrible ugliness make it so hard for me to be a socially-accepted adult who could someday have a significant other, kids, a family, and/or a job that keeps me afloat in life. When I get done thinking about that and how I'll never have a nice place in the world, I might even stumble upon a scanned photograph of me and my friends and former classmates from elementary school that one of my former friends uploaded to Facebook or Instagram. Whenever I've seen those photos I always choke up and shed tears like I'm doing a bit now as I write this. I can't help it. I was always a tough guy on the playing fields and even in an academic environment and was able to overcome challenges but the ones that I have to face now are insurmountable and they've broken my spirit and I have no hope. When I see how happy we all used to be as kids and I can remember how I had a place and how I was OK I always choke back my tears when I'm alone by myself, sometimes drunk after midnight on another weekend alone. Those photos bring back the only happy memories that I have and I choke back even more tears when I realize that I lose more and more memories of my childhood with each year as I age. When I get to a certain age, I don't even know what memories I'll have left anymore. If I lose them, it feels like I've never had much of anything at all in my life and it makes me so sad since I know that I won't have anything new when I wake up tomorrow. 

What keeps me awake at night is knowing that once I go to sleep, I have lost another day as a young man that I will never get back and that tomorrow I will lose one more. There is never a hilltop or a mountain peak that I reach in life. There is just another day of wandering the barren and decayed old landscape that once was my life with no sign of a happy future in sight. It hurts my heart to understand now that with each passing day I become more and more a ""have not"" in life and that I will more than likely die such a person, having left behind the happiest days of my life by the time that I was an upperclassman in high school.

"My kid sister pestered me until I agreed to go on a blind date with her older co-worker. I was fifty-one, well-travelled, had many interests, and a good job in the performing arts. Being both a professional resource person for fussy A-list creatives, and a survivor of two previous longterm relationships, I was reasonably domesticated, socially skilled, diplomatic, well groomed, and capable of generating getting-to-know-you conversation on a variety of subjects, and pitching them at a number of intellectual levels.

She turned out to be a loud, blowsy gal in her mid-fifties, going on twenty-five. She showed every depressing sign of having been the town pump a third of a century ago, sometime during the last days of disco. She had a bad peroxide job on a straw-textured, let-me-see-your-manager hairdo that didn't suit her face, and she wore orange lipstick, clunky wooden bead jewelry, and too much perfume and eyeliner. When she opened her door, the first words out of her mouth weren't ""Hi, I'm Laura; come in."" or ""Pleased to finally meet you"", but ""I just came back from the doctor and I have chlamydia, so don't expect any sex tonight"". The second or third thing she said was to ask suspiciously, ""So are you taking me someplace *nice*, tonight?"" She smelled of gin, and as we walked to the car she stumbled twice, so she'd already had a few while getting ready. Or perhaps it was because of her bunions, which were the size of canned hams, and made her feet almost as wide as they were long.

I'd used up a professional favour to get us a last-minute reservation at a new, very popular and high-end Chilean/Mexican restaurant. While we waited at the bar for our table to be made up, she ordered and knocked back three double shots of Patron Anejo in about fifteen minutes, thus chewing her way though the better part of a hundred dollar bill before we were even seated.

Her dinner order was ... lavish. In a *Mexican* restaurant. It covered our four-top table, and most of a side tray. As she masticated her way through it, her table conversation was mostly unintelligible, but the understandable parts revolved around bun-haired reality show stars and the probable sexual orientation of a series of Oprah interviewees. When she got up to go to the washroom, she pushed her chair back so violently, it shot straight into a waiter who spilled a carafe of wine over a guest at the next table. I don't think she even noticed what she had done.

Though I was only partway through my own meal, I left sufficient money to pay our tab and a large tip, and told the waiter that I had also included enough for the couple's spilled wine. I apologized to them for my date's carelessness, then met her the nanosecond she emerged from the ladies', and firmly took her to the car; fortunately she was either already too gorged to object, or simply too drunk to remember we hadn't finished our meal. She quickly fell asleep on the drive, thank God, so I didn't have to hear any more vacuous prattle about reality tv personalities; in fact, listening to her snorts and snores on the way back was literally the most enjoyable part of my evening.

When we got to her apartment, she vomited profusely the moment she got out of the car. She was so legless I nearly had to carry her up the short flight to her building entry (she was a pretty hefty gal), and had to take the keys from her hand when she couldn't work out which one opened the door. I saw her into the elevator, then left. And discovered, when I returned to my car, that she had peed the seat.

A week later my sister called and asked, ""So why haven't you called her? She said she likes you, and that you two had a really nice time together. She wants to see more of you."""

"Was at a meetup, trying to make some new friends, and a guy there went on for about two hours about how great Trump is, how awful the Black Lives Matter movement is, and then launched into 9/11 conspiracy theories about how it was a false-flag operation, they found explosives in the rubble, etc. It pissed me off, but he was just the typical ignorant blowhard.

Anyway, after a while, another girl at the table, who had until then seemed perfectly normal and cool, chimed in with, ""Yeah, and what about Sandy Hook!?"" She then proceeds to regurgitate the awful bullshit conspiracy theories about Sandy Hook, saying all the people involved were actors, etc, and deriding the ""mainstream media"" for ignoring the supposed evidence. The kind of bullshit that has actually lead to traumatised survivors and grieving parents being harassed by truther retards.

I don't think I've ever gone from having a positive feeling about someone to absolute sickened loathing so quickly. I wanted to start yelling at her, but I knew it would do absolutely no good, so I just made my excuses and got the fuck out of there as soon as possible."

Everyone told him no but before a counselor grabbed a hold of him he ran up and did it. Apparently it was a momma bear and its cub was behind the dumpster where we couldn't see it. The momma bear ran towards the kid and knocked down the kid and that fight or flight thing kicked in and I just ran like hell. I wasn't about to fight a pissed off, protective bear. Apparently the kid died and a counselor was seriously injured. I don't think it's destroyed my life but sometimes it just sneaks up on me. It makes me feel kinda cowardly, sometimes I think what would happen if I stayed but there was no way of saving that kid. Maybe I could of made it so the counselor didn't get hurt. Idunno."

There's no way to carry that all on my own, so without it, I just have carry the coffee pots on a tray and creamers in my pocket, set them on the tray holders throughout the dining room, and run back and forth between the tables and the tray to get what people need. I haven't served ice cream the new way yet, but I don't imagine serving ice cream for 70 people on a tray would go well. I don't know how it could even fit on one unless we use the large serving trays, and I don't know how I could manage to use those without hitting residents in the head while trying to hand other residents their ice cream, unless I again use the tray holders and run back and forth between the tables and the tray. 

All in all, the new rule just makes our job more difficult, cuts down on efficiency, and is just plain stupid. And why was this stupid rule made?...Because our GM thinks the carts are ugly. That's it. "

"If you're in Canada, say you're sorry even if the other person did something wrong. People joke about it on the internet, but seriously, not saying sorry even if you're not at fault feels super passive aggressive to Canadians.

Used to be a big point of conflict with my American ex. I literally snapped at him once ""what is it with you only ever apologizing when you admit you did something wrong??"" and instantly realized how insane that must have sounded to him.

Here, ""I'm sorry"" does not mean ""I accept blame for what just happened, please forgive me"", but ""I don't care who's at fault, blame me if you want, let's not make a thing of this and move on."" I like it. Getting over it is way more important than assigning blame."

Instead we named him Steven and have bouts of hiding him in hopes of scaring the ever-loving shit outta each other. Best one was when we still lived down there, early on in the Steven saga. My brother calls me into his room to see something on his computer and I oblige. My eyes were fixated on the screen, but in my peripheral vision I see the curtains move just a little. I got closer and out flies Steven and he continues to scuttle across the floor all the way to the door. Pretty sure I screamed, I thought he was possessed. My dad and brother were in cahoots and my dad was pulling a string. I've gotten them both back plenty though."

"After nearly three years working in a restaurant as a waiter/barman with an absolute wanker of a boss.  

My final shift was me looking after a huge party of chavs celebrating a birthday. They were all so rude and horrible and homophobic towards me.  

My boss came upstairs to check on them and myself, and one customer pulled out birthday banners from her bag and asked my boss if they could be put up. In front of them all my boss totally lost it at me for a solid few minutes then left.  

After that a couple of people at the table started berating me for being gay again, so I went behind the bar and told them they're not having any more drinks. As they kicked off and started more abuse from the table, I sat behind the bar and drank a beer. Then I got a bottle of wine, left the customers, went downstairs, told the manager I'm going for a cigarette (he underpaid me so knew and didn't mind me having the wine. I frequently took a bottle after a shift and he didn't care), went for my cigarette and just...continued walking. Never returned."

She also made special notes about the time wasted being poor (using buses, constantly looking for new work).  One point that I can recall is the amount she spent on shoes.  She needed to buy shoes every few months because she could only afford the cheapest shoes.  She knew that she could save money in the long run by getting higher quality shoes, but she never had the money to do it.  Little things like that add up."

"That decade like the 1960s can be divided into two eras, right around the time of the presidential changeover in the US (think JFK era vs LBJ).  

During Bush Sr days, it was still the 1980s.  Economy was hit or miss (recession in 90-92).  War in the gulf. Techno wizardry everywhere in consumer electronics. VCRs were still pricy (300$) and cars were just starting to get fast again now that fuel injection was ubiquitous. The Miata was a new thing.  The CRX or MX-6 was the hot thing to have.  Geo (GM) cars were everywhere since they were cheap.  Fashion was tailored, had tons of colors and was just getting out of the eye-searing neon highlighter colors on everything phase going to jewel tones, but still very colorful, not the beige beige black and more beige we have today.  Big hair was everywhere.  Music was very New Jack Swing and dancy.  Madonna's Deeper and Deeper, CeCe Penniston, Snap!, Haddaway, Digital Underground, Tony Toni Toné, etc.

Clinton gets into office and BAM.  We got grunge.  Clothes suddenly became all flannel and worn out looking with muted/faded colors and just looked desparately in need of a good laundering.  Wrinkles from the laundry pile, frayed edges, too-worn-out-for-thrift-shops clothes became ""in"". ""Heroin Chic"" became a thing and women were all wanting to be size negative-14 with greasy, weed-eater-trimmed hairdos and that spacey I-just-woke-up-where's-my-hit expression.  Okay, later in the decade we got the ""Rachel"" and every girl had it.  Grunge music was suddenly everywhere. EVERYWHERE. People were either into Grunge or rap/hip hop.  Zero middle ground.  Every band got a record deal so there was lots of noisy dreck being foisted.  The labels all believed they could do no wrong and sales of CDs were booming. Cars went from angular to jellybean shaped (see 92 Camaro vs. 93 Camaro; 93 vs 94 Mustang; 91 vs. 92 Civic; Ford Tempo to Ford Contour). Everybody suddenly had to have a Tahoe or an Explorer since gas prices dropped (I paid 72c/gallon in Dec 1997!).  In 1997, safety requirements on cars were updated so no more pop-up headlights, and everyone had mandatory impact standards and airbags all over.  Cars were safer but more bland because designers couldn't figure out how to make cars that passed safety requirements and look unique simultaneously.  All the techno-wizardry and innovation in consumer electronics collapsed into one object - the computer in your home and its dial-up internet. The dot-com era was blossoming and the economy was unstoppable toward the end of the decade.  I remember seeing a license plate on a hot new 98 Lexus GS430 that said ""GO DOW"". Stock options were suddenly a thing at everyone's workplace.  Monica Lewinsky and Gennifer Flowers took over the headlines at that point.  Then we got the backlash that brought us Bush Jr.  "

"Not OP, but one of my early jobs was in the training dept of a very, very large company whose locations are robbed often enough that security training is required. I can tell you that we taught, at that time, that you give the robbers whatever they want, but you never unlock anything, not ever. Something that was currently happening at the time was that robbers were coming to locations during the early morning hours to wait for the folks who unlocked and went in to prep for opening. Or they would wait outside to grab an employee leaving at closing. They didn't rob the first to arrive or the last to leave. Instead, they would grab the people arriving right before opening or leaving right at closing. They would use these people to threaten the people who were locked inside (i.e., let us in, or we kill these people). The research that the company had basically said that robbers are either going to kill everyone to get rid of witnesses, or they're not going to hurt anyone. Basically, the theory was, if they are going to kill the people outside, then they were going to kill all of you anyway. Don't let them in. There was actually one robbery in our region that happened exactly that way, too. Robbers killed all five people who were working that morning after threatening to kill two outside, and the three inside let them in."

"Well, it was PG-13, but I agree. Giving the movie bloodless violence takes away the horror that the books set out to portray.

I get why the studio had to shoot for a PG-13 rating. The book series was aimed at teenagers and an R-rating would have limited the audience too much. But what bothers me is that film ratings have gotten a lot stricter in the past few decades. If The Hunger Games came out 20-30 years ago, it could have had more intense violence while keeping the PG-13 rating."

But no amount of good quality film could make this guy look any less douche) They break up a month later. Another month later she has met a new attractive and responsible looking man. They seem very happy, this lasts a while. She finishes school and gets a job in her major, they end up buying/leasing a house together. Current boyfriend has a crazy ex who is trying to keep his child from him, his kid seems to like this girl a lot. Crazy ex hates girl for that reason. Girl is more of a mom to his kid than crazy ex. Surprise! Friend is pregnant, boy is excited, everyone's excited, hooray! Months go by, crazy ex is still crazy, boyfriends daughter apparently is abused by this crazy ex. Baby is born! It is a boy named Bryson. Boyfriend cheats on baby momma, baby momma still looks after his daughter? (she was still posting pictures with her after her posts about her cheating bf) Some time goes by where she actually doesn't post (woooow!) all of a sudden pictures appear with her and allegedly cheating boyfriend. Turns out crazy ex framed him for a cheater to get him and baby momma to break up (it worked apparently) Currently they are a growing strong and stronger couple with a cute little family! 

That was all over the course of 5-6 years. She posted SO. OFTEN. that I didn't seek out her posts, they were just all over my news feed. She shares literally everything on Facebook.

in the 1920's for some weird reason America got it in it's head that the Canada was going to invade America. So America started to plan a way to invade Canada. At the same time Canada fear that America was going to invade them. So they came up with a plan to Invade America.

"Northrop Grumman. Everyone assumes that any company involved in the military industrial complex is equivalent to death, but here's the thing. The US military is too the point where it needs a vast amount of equipment and will need to be supplied regardless. If companies like Northrop weren't there than almost all contracts would go to the hegemony that is Lockheed(Boeing is also there but they have handedly lost most contracts since the 80s,) and thus the quality of equipment soldiers use (including defensive equipment) would decline. NG also provides many scholarships and funds STEM research in a great deal of places. This can be seen as self-serving, but it provides a lot of good in those domestic communities. "

I thought the line in question went, ""got lonely Starbucks lovers,"" like it's referring to people that sit in the Starbucks by themselves because they got stood up or something like that, and the blank space was for the cup of coffee she'd order for him (that he would never show up to drink) and that she was self-aware about it and had sort of resigned herself to her fate by that point.

"The fact that *all* of her exes were horrible people who had done horrible things to her and she was always just the victim... there were a bunch of other red flags, but when I ran into a guy I worked with while her and I were walking into a store and she freaked out about me knowing him (he was one of her exes who she had shit talked, but only referred to him by his first name), I had to question all her stories. This guy was one of the most stand-up people I'd ever met. Turns out she was batshit insane. 

Also accused me of having sex with her dog because she had a dream about it. Definitely don't ignore that."

"[serious] I am both a daughter-in-law and a mother-in-law (of sorts). My mother-in-law formed her opinion of me when her whiney son went home to complain that I do not dote on him the way she does. OF COURSE ""Mom"" only knows what her son tells her. Thus, she has told me to my face that I am ""selfish"" for not catering to her son, even though I financially supported his lazy a**. Similarly, my own son has talked about his woman. I do not live near them, nor do I live with them. My impression is based on what my son tells me about his woman because I rarely see them. My son's woman is intelligent, beautiful and incredibly charming. So, sons, be careful when you run home and complain to Mom. That's my story and I am sticking to it."

I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

"This was about 5 years ago. I'm an engineer but worked from home as a regional sales guy. Married with one daughter, 5 years old at the time. If I wasn't traveling for work then I was at home all day in my office. Daughter was in preschool all day. Well, one day when I was working from home my wife and I had an appointment together, so we left the house but only for just over 1 hour. We drove separately since she had other things to do afterwards, and I went back home to get back to work. Later that day, she comes home and goes into our daughter's room and yells out to me ""What did you do to [daughter's name's] room?!"" I have no idea what she's talking about and go to the room. There are drawers pulled out and tossed across the room, one upside down.  Looks like done with some force based on the slight damage where it hit another piece of furniture. Nothing in the house was taken and there was no sign of forced entry. I checked, and all the doors were locked. It had to have happened when we were both out at that appointment in the morning.
To this day I have no explanation, and it freaked us out so bad that I changed all the locks and installed a security camera system to monitor all the entry points. I was so puzzled that I even considered the ridiculous possibility that I may have done it myself and blocked it out. Now, we did have a cleaning lady with a key to the house and the most sensible thing is that she had something to do with it, but of all rooms, why ransack a 5 year old's girl's room? And was the person who did it still in there when I went back to work? Crazy. I try not to think about it and we don't live there any more."
