Wearing yoga pants all over the place to run errands. I've been everywhere besides Australia and this is def just an American thing. I had a nun in Rome give me a dirty look while I was actually running in yoga pants like I was a whore for exposing my ass like that. Edit: yoga pants are ok with me you win.
"Part 1 of 2

I found out the man I thought was my biological father, was in fact not. Brace yourself, this is a long story, and I'm editing it. It's all true, and even friends who lived through it with me don't believe it sometimes. Stick with me for the pay-off.

Growing up, I had my ""Dad"" like every kid does. My Mom and Dad divorced when I was about six, but he was a great Dad, stayed in my life, was always there for me. To this day, I consider him my father and love him as such. He's a pretty great guy, even though we don't agree on a lot (he's deeply religious, and i'm not).

When I'm nine, my mom remarries. Her new husband, my step dad, is another good guy who does right by me. We don't see eye to eye on a lot (I'm seeing a pattern here), but he provided for us, and treated me exactly the same as his kids. While we had issues, and what teen doesn't, he's been amazing to my Mom.

Junior High School rolls around, and I see an AfterSchool special about adoption. I note my Mom is short, red hair, green eyes. My dad is hispanic, black hair, dark eyes. I am 6'2, 210 pounds, blue eyed. Something isn't adding up, so I ask. Mom says ""Don't be ridiculous, you aren't adopted"". I shrug. Ok, weird.

Biology class occurs, and we hit dominant and recessive genes. Turns out me being blue eyed isn't possible. I ask again, get same answer. You are NOT adopted. Stop it. 

So one day I'm at my Dad's house, and he's Mormon and like a lot of Mormons has an interest in Genealogy. I'm doing research for a paper of my family tree, and I see a folder with my name on it. So, I pull it out, and stapled inside, the very first thing are my adoption papers.

My world kind of spins. I can't really describe the feeling I felt just then. It was like the basic foundation of my life just crumbled mixed with a lot of ""I KNEW IT"" and holy shit i've been lied to a long time now feelings. Instant identity crisis. 

I called my Mom, she came over and got me, and explained that while my Dad is the guy she married, he's not my biological father. That's this other guy, who she tell me a little about.  She talks me down a little, and I pull it together. Ok, fine. I'll sort this out. 

I set out, and this is pre-internet so I start trying to find my biological father without much luck. All I have is a name. But, my grandmother passes away and my grandfather confides in me that he still knows my biological dad at the funeral, and walks me over to a guy and says ""This is your biological father"". The guy and I are both a little stunned. We have a brief conversation, he give me his contact info. The world spins again, but hey, cool. I finally meet the guy and we can talk.

He and I go out for dinner a little while after that, and talk. I really like the guy, even though again, we differ in matters of faith and politics. He's a stand up guy though, and over time we develop a relationship that means a lot to me. He remarries, and I gain two little sisters that I really think are awesome people.

More time passes, and at a conference I get a free 23 and me kit. I submit it, and find it fascinating. I’ve got a family of my own at this point, and I think “You know, someday my kid might find having this information from his parents and grandparents valuable”, so I buy kits for my mom and biological father. They send them in, and I promptly forget all about it and don’t really look at it too closely. (foreshadowing!)

Meanwhile, I get contacted out of the blue on Facebook by someone who I find out in my daughter. She’s 24 years old, finishing college, and just wants to know who I am. 

Knowing exactly how this feels to be in her shoes, I welcome her in my heart and family with open arms. I’ll never forget the first time I met her, and hugged her because there is a moment where the world changes when you first hold your kid. When I first held my son I felt it, and when I first hugged her (even though she was 24) I felt it again. Since then we’ve developed a fantastic relationship and I couldn’t be a prouder dad. 

So, back to my story. Sorry, warned you it’s a long one. 

I read a story about 23andMe that’s linked in this thread about a guy finding a lost sibling and messing up his parents lives. I think “Oh, right! I need to go look at that data”. So, I go and look at it.

Well, my mom is my mom. 23andMe shows me that we are def Mother/Son. However my dad is attached to my account, but it doesn’t show us related. I mess around with it a little bit, but can’t figure out what I am doing wrong. I contact 23andMe support, who takes a look, and assures me everything is set up correctly.

“But if it’s all setup right, why isn’t my Dad showing as my Dad” I ask? The guy helping me says “We don’t comment on the data or the results, but I assure you it’s all setup correctly”. It takes me a minute to follow what he’s saying, but he continues, “Look, let me tell you this. You are *not* related to this person. As a matter of fact, you share so little genetic information I’d say it’s a little statistically unusual. Not are just not related to him, you’re about as not related as you could be”.

Cue that old familiar holy shit floor falling out feeling. What. The. Fuck.

As I process, I realize that the only possible explanations are my mom lied to me about who my Dad was FOR A THIRD TIME or that maybe she didn’t know herself. I take a little time to get my head together a bit, and call her up.

I tell her about the tests, and the results. She’s super upset, and tells me this is her worst nightmare. She never wanted me to find out, and now I’m thinking “Oh shit, she is super upset. Did something really awful happen? Is my real bio dad Charles Manson or some crazy crap like that?”

She explains no, nothing like that. Just a one night thing with a guy who it ends up was my first Dad’s college roommate.    She tells me his name, and starts giving me details about what he does, where he lives, etc. She says the timing of my birth it could have been either the guy I have up until now I thought was my bio-dad, or this new guy. She wanted it to be the one guy, so she told me it was him. She was so sure it was him.

Hold on here I think for a second. You know an awful lot about this guy. I ask if she’s still in touch with him, she says no, she just looks him up online sometimes. Ok, sure.  At this point I am just a total fucking mess and don’t know what to believe anymore.

I ask “Does my (originally thought bio dad) know about this? Does my first Dad know?” She says my first bio dad doesn’t know, and I shouldn’t tell him. She says my first Dad does know, because he legally adopted me”.

Ok, great. So my first dad has known this whole time too and not said anything. I’m 50 years old at this point, and i think the point of this kind of shit coming into the light and being brought to me is well past the point of being reasonable. 

I check with my Dad, and it turns out that he says “well, this (new guy) is certainly your real biological father, because his name was on the original birth certificate when I adopted you”. Sigh. Great. I’m just fucking punch drunk at this point.
