0,"I can't wait to fuck something up royally now so I can whisper this in horror. *""I put the chips on the baby.""*
Not that you messed up, OP, but damn that's a good phrase."
1,"&gt; And then she did it; she took a deep breath, and calmed her voice.  
  
  I want to believe"
2,"&gt;Listen - it's a holiday weekend, everyone has the day off work

Said the customer to the employee working on July 4th. Good gravy."
3,"Excellent response and perfectly reasonable.

Personally, I don't understand how people can get all the way to the checkout and then complain about prices. Presumably in your shop, items have price tags. No one's *forcing* her to buy those things."
4,I guarantee you that customer has worked in the service industry.
5,"Actually, no, US coffee shops probably would *not* have given a discount on the 4th. "
6,"How do you guys stay in business if you're always sold out?

By doing that. Exactly that. "
7,"I would have probably done the same thing. Besides, how else are you supposed to find her preference if she refuses to tell you what it is and yet still expects you to get it for her? "
8,I hope you bought your friend a beer. 
9,"&gt;Me: Sorry, I'm new and I'm not familiar with that particular brand, would you mind pointing them out to me so I could find them faster?

&gt;CC: No.

""Let me rephrase the question. Which ones do you want?""

CC: No.

""Have a nice day then.""

CC: [CIGARETTE BRAND NAME].

""No."""
10,"I'm Canadian and I don't throw out majority of my receipts..

Did I miss some kind of country wide memo that we're supposed to? "
11,That i did. Its still one of our favourite go to horror stories when we talk about retail
12,"To be fair,  she didn't really lose $100. She gave it away freely"
13,No.
14,"In addition, airports seldom offer discounts *at all*, ever, over here. She sounds like the sort of person who tries to get discounts for no good reason everywhere she shops. I'm terribly sorry we allowed her to escape, somehow."
15,"I wasn't going to pay for it, but now I'm REALLY not going to pay for it. "
16,Shoes may be sentient... they do have soles...
17,"This is a common thing I do when I'm out shopping. I had a cashier once get super apologetic when she had to wait on a manager to get change, like she was afraid that I was gonna no nuclear for having to wait 5 minutes. I told her it was cool, no worries. After a minute or two she's really apologizing and I told her I've worked retail before, I know how it is. The look of relief on her face said it all."
18,"i would have, but he had cash and i kinda felt bad for him having parents like that. I got the impression he was ashamed of them!"
19,You've really put the chips on the baby this time!
20,"No, but this lady apparently missed the country-wide excessive politeness memo.

Also a myriad of international memos about not trying to fucking steal, as it was obvious she was doing."
21,"&gt; The next man was much nicer and laughed about never seeing someone so irate this close to the holidays.

He must have never worked retail... &gt;_&gt;"
22,Young child + new equipment + peer pressure = stupidity. That's just how it is sometimes. But experience has taught him at a young age to be embarrassed by his parents' behavior. Could be worse. He could've nailed the backflip and then grown up to be exactly like his mom and dad.
23,A live lobster.
24,"I would have asked her for ID after I found the cigs, then take 5 min confiming its her. "
25,The thief wanted the plates for that sweet sweet parking real estate. 
26,"&gt;""It's your job. You get paid to do it.""

Fuck this logic, can't stand people who think like this, especially customers who leave perishables hidden in grocery aisles, can't tell you how many times we've had to throw away bad milk/meat because some stupid fuck was too lazy to put stuff back"
27,"&gt; My coworker steps in at this point, returns the guy's money in full, and the guy leaves.

And here we see WHY idiots pull crap like this. Because it often works."
28,"&gt;""Don't lie to me! You just don't want to help me out!""

""Of course I want to help you out.

Which way did you come in?"""
29,"&gt;if he doesn't come out here right now I am going to start screaming and yelling and throwing a huge fit in his store.

Can we call the police at this point?"
30,Maybe you should have turned the common sense switch on?
31,"I constantly get customers saying ""wow is it really x price? I got this same thing from ""shop"" way cheaper...."" then they look at me for five seconds and wait for me to do some kind of price match. I don't care if you go elsewhere, lady! "
32,"Oh, I'm very aware of that. Just thought it was funny that she tried to pull it. :p"
33,"Ha! At least it was something light like a bag of crisps, imagine if it had been a whole watermelon or something? üòÅ "
34,"That got me a little heated. If everyone has the day off, why the heck is my store open right now with your obnoxious ass in it?! Friggin' customers maaaaaang"
35,"I would have just started picking up chewing tobacco and cigars going ""oh is it this one?""

Who just says ""no?"" If she was wasting my time, I'd at least make it really fun."
36,I would have told the boy that his parents need to come in and complete the purchase and then stare at them with a grin on my face.
37,Attention all shoppers: If you are using a gift card today please come to the front so we can confiscate it if it's $100 in duration. Thank you for shopping at Crazy Mart.
38,You could have still offered a Faustian deal for the shoes.
39,"Wait, he came back and apologized?  Now I know you are making this story up. :-)"
40,"Pretty much. 

When I worked retail I got a small handful of people like this.

Once it happened like 2 nights before Christmas and we were *packed*.

Me: Hmmm, I'm not familiar with that particular book (just from their description, at the counter, holding everyone up), can I get you to step over here and give me the title or author so I can run a system search for you?

Them: No.

Me: Then I guess I can't help you, unfortunately. Sorry about that. Next?!

The person behind them was on it. Literally came up and edged them away from the counter and put their stuff up for me to start ringing it up.

It was glorious."
41,"TIL that in the U.K., ""flapjacks"" are cereal/granola bars. 

For a moment I pictured unwrapped, warm pancakes sitting in a stack on counter, which really only enhances the story. "
42,"""I put the chips on the baby"" should be someone's new flair. This quote is truly something for the ages."
43,"&gt;Guy: Well fuck you.

Yeah, that's not a smile you just inspired."
44,"'By god, you're right! This is an outrage. Let's stage a protest immediately! I'll stand on the belt, you go and build a pile of carts in the middle of the shop.'"
45,That will be a funny story for the little girl to tell when she is older but that poor mother must have been mortified! Hope there are no repercussions on your job as it was a total accident.
46,I think he thought it was like a job application lol. 
47,"You: Is this what you were looking for?


CC: NO

You: Is this what you were looking for?


CC: NO


You: Is this what you were looking for?

CC: YES.

You: Is this what you were looking for?

CC: NO


Now THAT would have been trolling.
"
48,"This situation's gone totally chips-on-a-baby, we better get out of here!"
49,What an ass
50,That's when you tell him to pull into a parking spot and get his done last.
51,TL DR : how cold is it outside? Green. 
52,Sweet everyone has the day off?? Let me go pack my bags and leave then! I should let my coworkers know! 
53,"I'll admit to never having flown on the 4th, but I honestly don't think most, let alone all airport coffee places, give discounts just because it's Freedom Day. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go nude soak in my traditional freedom tub."
54,"The closest I ever got to a customer doing that was when a crazy irate lady was screaming at me over coupons, and then shouted ""THIS IS WHY YOU'RE-"" then silenced herself and glared at me for the next minute instead. I wonder what she was about to bless my ears with..."
55,"I've got a similar story!

When I left my last job, I was the rental guy, a customer wanted to rent a trailer, and before they rent, I have to take a look at their vehicle to make sure it's up to spec and has the right light connections and what not, so, anyway, the customer had parked like, on the other side of the parking lot.

So I ask him to walk me over to his car so I can take a look at it. He grumbles a bit, and I follow him out. ""I'm a very busy man"" he says. ""I checked everything with the guy last night, so I wouldn't have to waste all this time in the morning, and yet here we are, and here you are wasting my time. Whose fault is that.""

So, since it was my last day, I quipped back ""Well, I'm not the one that parked two miles away from the trailers, so I guess this one's on you, sir.""

Dude got redfaced, started sputtering and stammering about how he wanted to talk to a manager when we got back in, since I was being rude. ""It's my last day anyway, I already put my two weeks notice in. Being free to be honest with folks that are being rude to me is just one of the perks of quitting. Yer' Jeep's good, go pull up to the trailers, then come in, and we'll get your contract set up.""

He shut up after that, and honestly looked embarrassed as all hell.

Thankfully I didn't have to check him back in when he brought it back, because I was free. ;u;"
56,"Which is where they belong.

What the hell is a cashier going to do when someone says prices are too high?  They're getting paid to ring out people, but deal with pricing."
57,"Stolen car wouldn't be a 911 call, unless it was stolen with their kids inside. Should have told them to call the police themselves. Most people do have cellphones."
58,Dog fighting is illegal but is lobster vs baby
59,"I thought the manager she talked to was gonna turn out to be a customer.

While at a bakery some lady mistaked my dad for a manager giving out food. She tried to take one from our box. It was really fucking awkward."
60,"Ugh, another one of *those*. I've responded to other similar posts. I've got one of those ""resting bitch"" faces, where I could be in the best mood of my life, but I'm not one to wear a huge, cheesy grin all over my face. So people are always telling me to smile or asking if I'm okay, or things like that. One guy I used to work with would say, ""SMILE - it ain't that bad!"" like, *every single time* he saw me. It was especially annoying on those days when I was in a super good mood.

It's like, come on. Just let me be me. I don't go around saying, ""Hey, you smile too much. Tone it down."""
61,I think I did it wrong.
62,"These are the people that complain about their identity being stolen in a store, but then go home and click on attatchments telling them that their computer has a virus and all they need to do is put their social and credit card number in to have it fixed."
63,"This would be the exact same customer that complains about stores putting out holiday merchandise 'too early,' right? Of course it is."
64,I am from the NSA. Thank you. We have him in custody.
65,"You: Is this you? 

Her: yes 

You: Oh you do know how to say yes. Would have been useful earlier "
66,Damn I'm just sitting here wishing I could accidentally  tru to pay $800  for a burrito and laugh it off 
67,"What does it say about me that I was expecting a story about a lady who gets herself covered in gas, or who nearly blows everyone up?
Seems like it could have been a lot worse. I'm guessing she has overpaid for gas a lot at prepay stations and has lost perspective on how much gas costs."
