0,"Dispatcher: ""We have a report of a two ninety-nine in progress..."""
1,That man is to be applauded. He actually acted like a rational and understanding human being. A true unicorn in retail.
2,"If you want one of our spray caps, you can buy one of our bottles."
3,"this took a completely different turn to what I was expecting, and I loved it "
4,"Wooowww...I don't really have anything to say to that. I'd probably be laughing too. Banned from shopping after our shifts. That's right, I forgot we're not actual human beings."
5,This old adage applies here:  A lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part.
6,"Welcome to retail, where break times are made up and holidays don't matter."
7,"She was just showing off, anyone really well off would not have talked about the price, just asked for the best in the first place"
8,I'd actually guess that she's one of those rich people who think that they're middle class because they've never lived any other way. So she thinks she's being frugal but has no idea what that actually is.
9,"When I worked retail, we had a lady with a son about 10ish, and he was the pickiest child I knew. Peanut butter sandwiches, fruit snacks, Hi-C, and Yoo Hoo were all he would eat. This woman got the idea that she just had to keep trying new foods until he found something he liked, and then he would add to his accepted foods.

Now, lots of parents try this with kids with sensory issues and general pickiness. But what they do not do is buy the value size pack of what they want their child to try, and try to return the rest when he doesn't like it.

Her reasoning always was that food was expensive, so if he liked it, she didn't want to have bought the more expensive smaller pack and wasted money. But if he didn't like it, it was no good to her, and it wasn't fair she paid for something she couldn't use.

I saw this woman return a pack of cookies missing 1 cookie, a pack of carrot sticks with a half bitten stick, ice cream with a teaspoon scooped out of it, and even things you would think the whole family could use, like a bag of apples with a bite taken out of one, or orange juice with 1/4 cup or so missing. It was odd. 

Eventually after she made a fuss trying to return jam with a scoop taken out of it, which she threw at a pregnant employee, she was banned. "
10,I suspect some mental disability of some sort /:
11,I am convinced that people that blow up like that KNOW they are going to be told they're wrong and are just WAITING for that so they can blow up about it.
12,As a lactose intolerant I may still sample some cheeses. Then I can sue you. Right? That's how this all works out?
13,"""The customer is always right!""

""You're not a customer, sir, you're a trespasser."""
14,"Well, atleast she came in before the holiday to question why you are open, and not on the holiday itself.

She's okay in my book."
15,"Honestly, I'd have thought cosmetics too. If a young person had asked me for wrinkle remover, I wouldn't have known what they wanted."
16,"I used to give irate customers a blank stare while they got it out of their system.  Once they were finished ranting and raving, I would look them in the eye and in an even voice I would ask, ""Are you done?""

This was a surprisingly disarming question.  Once they acknowleged that they were, in fact, ""done"", I would say something like, ""Now, are you gonna let me help you?""

It was cool being friends with my boss."
17,The last two sentences are the most wonderfully poetic and truthful lines about working retail I have ever heard.
18,"I had a couple of ladies do that for me once. Actually, they were confused at first when I put the closed sign behind their items. They thought I was trying to push *them* away and looked like they were almost insulted. But I assured them that they were my last customers. Anyone that tried to come through after that was met by these two ladies telling them I was closed and they needed to go somewhere else. Momentary bliss! LOL"
19,"I would have kept an eye on her until she had left the store, she seems like person who would try to fix her problem by stealing. "
20,"""Overstaffed"" and ""Discount Retail store"" Two words I have never heard together, enjoy it while you can!"
21,"My best friend's son is allergic to all dairy - one bite can kill him.  And since he was 3, he knew not to take food from anyone without confirming it was safe.  Apparently that woman is dumber than a toddler."
22,"Glad she got banned instead of getting a gift card, which seems to happen in about half the stories where a customer assaults an employee."
23,Exactly.  Then return the broken one to the other store when it's convenient but within the return time frame and don't forget your receipt.
24,"Yet another person with money to spend and no idea how much things cost. She probably get taken for a ride by sellers regularly. I worked with a guy (an Armenian) who would give what he called ""an Armenian discount"" to these types. He sold handmade jewelry in his boutique and would offer them this discount, a 100-200% mark-up (nothing had a price on it). They always seemed happy with their special price."
25,"You should have placed a knife between two pieces, pulled it up and out of the bread, then acted all surprised that it didn't work to unslice the bread."
26,Good thing you didn't blow your top.
27,Retail workers = lower form of life.  Customer logic.
28,"This. I live in one of the wealthiest counties in the US and people here are ridiculous and they don't understand how ridiculous they are. They talk and complain about how ""bad"" neighborhoods are, about how they're building another new store/gym/park/housing development. The school system... to hear them talk about the schools... They have crossing guards, routinely each year kids from these public schools are accepted to ivy league schools, they're building a 4th high school in the city I'm in, but to hear people talk about the schools you'd think literacy is an issue. 

Rich people who have never known anything other than what they see every day think $50/lb cheese is affordable because they've been to a party where the host was in the 1% of the 1% and they think that makes them middle class. "
29,"Maintain eye contact.

Get out larger box.

Place small box into large box.

Wrap larger box.

Repeat as many times as you have box sizes."
30,Maybe you should stop being a damn soviet communist bastard
31,She's going to go yell at her husband for being too slow.
32,This lady had a fantasy her whole life: to have her own arm ripped off and then be spanked with it. She waited decades for this moment. And you laughed her off.
33,"I think the customer was the communist....after all, he was the one with no class"
34,"I always enjoy when people pretend to know more than you about your own job. 

""Sorry sir, but this computer is broken and therefore cannot be returned""

""I WAS A COMPUTER BACK IN 95 AND I KNOW WHAT A BROKEN COMPUTER LOOKS LIKE AND THIS COMPUTER IS FINE IM CALLING CORPORATE"""
35,"In the wise words of Rupaul, ""Unless they paying your bills pay them bitches no mind"""
36,"Or ... or take the kids to the bank FIRST so they can learn what those wonderful buildings are for as well. I don't know about you but when I was a kid I was super excited to get my fist $10 bill, and my first $20 bill. Kids get to spend change all the time, cash is rare."
37,[deleted]
38,"This. I can't stand these, ""I'm sorry you're having to work on $Holiday."" types, as they stand in the store buying something last minute. If you wouldn't come in, we won't be open. If we can't make enough money to stay open, we won't stay open."
39,"""... unless you write my paychecks."""
40,I'm more of an ass man. My friend is a tits guy.  This dude is a menu guy...
41,If the building was on fire he would be the type to ask if you are open.
42,"That's hysterical. 

I can do you one better--when I worked at a shoe store, they encouraged us to 'compliment the customer on their purchase' while checking them. Things like saying how well their new boots would go with their winter coat, telling them how lucky they were to get this pair in their size because they're flying off the shelves, stuff like that. I had kind of a generic comment stored away in my head for each style of shoes that we sold that came out of my mouth almost like muscle memory.

So one summer we got a new line of sandals that had memory foam insoles built in. My standard comment for anyone buying a sandal from that line was something to the effect of ""These are so comfy! You can walk for miles and not feel a thing!"" I happily spewed off this line to one woman buying a pair, only to realize as the words were coming out of my mouth that the woman was, in fact, in a wheelchair. 

Face. Palm."
43,"Stay golden, pony boy."
44,instructions unclear: Customer dead
45,I used to work at a grocery shoppe like that. Once had a man buy a slice of this aged European cheese for $55. It wasn't even a big piece. He said he was 'feeling peckish'. Some people have weird concepts of what is 'affordable'.
46,"Fuck man, don't make me giggle. I'm a manly man"
47,"I mean it's one banana, Michael, what could it cost? Ten dollars?"
48,"Yes ma'am, would you like me to get one down for you?
"
49,"I've had a customer like that. Told her I'd grab the item for her. 


""How many do you want ma'am? ""



""It's buy-1-get-1 free""




""So two?""




""It's buy-1-get-1-free""



""So two then?"" *I grabbed them, handed them to her and walked away* 




Should've kept on but I was busy lol"
50,"Retail bot is not a protected class, yet !"
51,"I'm a fan of showing kids what paper money is, if only because teaching them alone is hilarious. My little brother's first experience was when he won a betting pool on a fishing outing with dad. ..Somehow he was the only one to catch a fish that day, go figure. The pool came out to $51, and whoever had been holding the cash presented him with a fifty and a one.

Huge money for a young kid, but he looked down at the two bills in confusion, then asked if he'd really only won $2. We had to convince him he hadn't been robbed."
52,"Agreed. I was expecting a 'grumpy patriot' style response (eg expletives and freedoms and rights and constitution) but instead it turned into a feelgood story with an old guy who still knows the meaning of the word 'fun'.

Loved it!"
53,"People seem to think acting super angry will get them more. Wrong
 I can see people prepping with their angry faces and standing up straighter when they walk over to me. Makes me want to roll my eyes as they start their rant about whats wrong and why this place is terrible, they cant beleive we let this happen to them, etc.

If you're mean I'll hand you over to someone else, say I can't help you, or do the bare minumum.

If you're really sweet and understanding, I'm going the extra mile for you. Guaranteed."
54,"&gt; But I am having this problem now!

Yeeees, and? 

Some people. Only think of themselves. "
55,"Yup. I know a lady like this. She's an elderly lady, in her 90's now, and just one of the nicest people you could ever hope to meet. She's very wealthy, and always has been. Her parents were wealthy, she married someone wealthy, she's really never known anything else. And, because of this, she really truly does not understand how well off she is. She's not at all snobby, she would never look down upon anyone, she just doesn't understand. One time, she told me how they were raising her medical insurance premium. She said something like, ""What would happen if someone couldn't afford to pay that much?"" I replied with, ""Well, a lot of people can't. They don't have medical insurance."" (This was before Obamacare). She was *floored* by my response. She said, ""Well, that's not right."" "
56,"So, I'm guessing this is one of those women that insist that they wear a size too small for them because they are obsessed with the size label?

It reminds me of why women's clothing sizes are absolutely absurd.   Clothiers learned that they get more sales if they mark dresses as ""size 0"" when it is more of a medium size (size 0 used to mean for an ultra petite woman).   As a result, nothing matches in size between any brand.    So anyone that has to shop for women's clothing, thank fools like the lady in this story for making it harder..."
57,She needed a hard reset. 
58,I do that all the time like the old lady. I was a cashier during university and those idiots who can't read would make it take an extra 20 minutes before I could goto lunch.  I always point at the sign and the light off and point out that I'm their last customer.
59,"Same thing with my nephew and nuts or eggs.

My theory is that the woman is lactose intolerant but LOVES cheese.  She doesn't even go down the cheese aisle because it makes her cry and here these heathens are just throwing free cheese in her face (figuratively)."
60,"Haha. ""Closed"" means nothing to most customers in the US. Some even forcing their way through closed doors and past barriers and signs and asking to reopen the register once the store is functionally closed just after hours so they can make a single transaction."
61,Those are 2.99
62,"We need more managers like you!

I wish customers would realize the harshness and after-effects of their words sometimes, and this is a great way of making them realize it, and so I thank you for that. Keep being awesome, pal."
63,"This made me laugh, thanks for the funny story 😄"
64,"I wish I had that luck. I used to work at a generic blue box store that would purposefully leave the customer service register open 15 minutes after closing in case of after hours walk ups. And of course once let in they would want to shop and we couldn't outright tell them to leave. So we would have to stay there until they left which at times was 90 minutes after closing. I hate retail. So glad I left that hell hole. 

Edit: some words"
65,"He was upset because you didn't call him ""honey"" like the cashier at the other store did.  Try saying, ""I can't check you out on the computer, HONEY""  Maybe that was the missing piece."
66,"""Sorry, our time machine is out of order."""
67,"A friend of mine recently had his 15 year old nephew down to visit, and said nephew expressed an interest in going shooting for the first time. My friend is adequate at his own safety but didnt trust himself to properly teach him the safety aspects, so he asked me. I made the nephew memorize and then write down, by memory, the 4 Rules of firearm safety before I even lined up a trip to the range. You simply do not fuck around, ever, when it comes to this kind of stuff."
68,"Oh wow, didnt think anyone would care! Actually I dont know what happened to the child. The woman left him there as far as im concerned.  
She actually became very embarrassed and paid with coupons, which only brought the total down about $10. She left in a huff though, and said she'd give a bad reveiw. "
69,"He probably just went along with it the first time, but left thinking ""No way in Hell we'll actually have to pay for that freight charge, watch.""

If you can afford fancy showers, you can afford 30 dollars in shipping."
70,"I can't help but smile evilly at ""We're listening now.""

I had a customer speak to me like a child about a week ago and I just know it was only because she genuinely thought I was 14 and just learning to do my job. I'm 21 years old and my bagging method just didn't coincide with what she wanted (but didn't bother requesting in the first place)

It's comforting to see it happen the other way around, and in a situation where it's actually just."
71,"Jeez, what a winer. She really needed to put a cork in it."
72,"Uh no, didn't you see what the lady said? You can have their job! You eat the cheese and then become the manager of the place, you see."
73,"I hope he bought things like paper towels, napkins, and birthday cards and you packed them all in paper, not plastic bags."
74,"""I'm with corporate.""
""Then you should definitely look into changing these policies, because corporate is where they come from."""
75,"I have no comment. Only a *snork* and an upvote. 

Well, what DO you say to that?! "
76,But what was the outcome? Did the lady leave? Stay? Did they ever pay the full price? Was the coupon added? Did y'all ever find that missing child? Is he/she still wandering the store?
77,It was 2.99.
