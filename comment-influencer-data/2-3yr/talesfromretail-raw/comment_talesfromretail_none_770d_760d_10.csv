0,I need a refund because I'm stupid.
1,"Assuming she drove there, she essentially *paid* to come yell at you. "
2,"&gt;keep energy high

sounds awful."
3,"I work in a custom framing shop and also run in to people leaving their orders with us for years. Add to that the fact that the owner won't get rid of anything, and it's a nightmare. I finally convinced her to go through old things and make room and I found something that was completed in 2001. SIXTEEN YEARS AGO. Bonus: a super cool glow-in-the-dark constellation chart that had been there since 2006 that I got to take home. "
4,What a great manager. 
5,TIL people think gift cards work on all stores within line of sight.
6,"A customer does this once, there's plausible deniability. Oops a mistake.  But for her to re-apply the wrong label and then attempt again, to purchase it $50 below price, after being told that is not the correct price,  isn't that breaking the law?   I think you'd be in the right to at least 86 her from the store. "
7,I have to ID everyone for M rated games. Some people get so pissed off about it. I know you are over 17 but it's my job to see it. So please from all the retail workers don't throw a fit over it. 
8,"its original, I'll say that"
9,"My store was robbed once. I was the Assistant Manager, my Manager was off somewhere out of the store as usual. I had one employee with me that day. During the early afternoon, I come out of the back room and see two men walk into the store. One stayed by the door as a lookout, the other started walking towards me. In my head, it instantly hit me what was about to happen, but my employee was not paying attention and was organizing the game wall. I was off camera, when I started walking towards my employee and threw out the greeting to the men that came in. I got to my employee leaned in next to him and just told him""brace yourself, were about to get robbed"". I turn around and the guy that was heading towards me is right behind me with the gun already to my face. He gives me the standard ""give me the money"" line so I comply. I head to the registers open them both up and give them the money within both. Luckily it was just about $400 dollars altogether because I had barely made a money drop into the safe before heading into the back room. When he tells me to open the safe, I complied but explained it was on a fifteen minute timer before it would open. The guy decides to take off with his buddy after taking a few game systems too. After they leave I locked the doors, checked on my employee to make sure he was okay, and called the police and district manager. They all come in, the police take their reports and the district manager helps out in whatever way possible. The following morning I come in and my manager came in early in the morning to open the store. He pulls me to the back and has the balls to tell me that I didn't give the guys the store greeting when they walked in and that would have stopped them from going through with the robbery. Mind you I had just come out of the back office and the camera was only pointing at the register, which means he I was not on camera to see if I gave the greeting or not. I quietly got up and told him I was going to go home now and take the rest of the day off and walked out of the store before i decided to hulk out on the guy. Suffice it to say I didn't stay there much longer."
10,"Gotta love a small town sometimes.  I had a angry customer yelling at me while I was alone in the store.  No big deal.  I notice another customer walk in and stand back waiting his turn.  I again tried to explain to angry customer what his options were but he wasn't having it.  He started threatening me.  At that point, the other customer in the store cleared his throat.  Angry customer glanced over his shoulder to look at the other customer.  His eyes got big, he muttered an apology, took the info I offered him, and shuffled out of the store.

The other customer was a police officer who happened to come in to pay his bill."
11,"It reminds me of a bit of an incident at my place of work - not retail, but still customer service (I work in a restaurant). A lady walked in and claimed she had a table booked, but we couldn't find her reservation in our diary. 

Me: Are you absolutely sure you phoned the right telephone number when you booked?

Her: Yes, yes, I googled X Restaurant and phoned the number that came up!

Me: ... But, we're Y Restaurant, not X Restaurant. 

Her: But it says X Restaurant over there! *points out the door and  across the street, to X Restaurant which is on the other side of the road*

Me:... Yes, it says so over there because that's X Restaurant, across the street. We're Y Restaurant, it says so above the door that you walked through. Why would you come in here?

Her: Because it says X Restaurant right over there!!

I just could not speak. She walked out the restaurant and crossed the street to the correct place. I had, and still have, absolutely no words for how bizarre that encounter was. Why would you see the name of the restaurant you want to eat at, and then walk into a different restaurant on the other side of the road with a different name above the door? Was she high and had lost all sense of direction? Was she suffering from memory loss or some sort of mental illness? We will never know."
12,"99% chance of fraud, especially with iTunes cards."
13,"Always use the line ""hey I know you're over 18, however the machine requires I check your ID otherwise it won't let me sell the product. May I have your ID?""

That way if they get upset, they just yell at the machine."
14,"honestly, if someone said that I'd be more likely to give them one."
15,Are you British? Cos it sounds awful to me as well.
16,"Yea ""welcome to used game store how can I help you?"" is totally going to stop a planned robbery. The hell is wrong with these people."
17,"So, he received multiple calls that he needed to come pick up his XBox, and never once did he think that maybe, just maybe, he should call back and check that the store is okay with holding it until December. I mean, the purpose of stores having items is to sell them, not hold them for someone to eventually take. Every paid for item sitting there is taking up room that could go to sellable stock.

Every single year, my Father hid our gifts in the cabinet in his study. He never had an issue, because my brothers and I knew we were not allowed to touch that cabinet, and did not. As parents, it's your job to lay down appropriate rules to keep your kids out of places they shouldn't be. And if they ruin their Christmas surprise, maybe that will teach them a lesson about not poking around their parents' things."
18,"I carded a 92 year old woman while working the door at an upscale cocktail bar. She and her party laughed and loved the interaction and attention.
The very next party of soccer moms I turned away because they didn't bring their IDs.
'Any of us could be your mother.'
Yup and I get paid to card everyone, even my great-great-grandma badass who was prepared."
19,Paid in gas and time. Did she really not have anything better to do?
20,"She'd better be careful - if she gives away too many pieces of her mind, she won't have anything left. Of course, from what you've posted, it sounds like that's already happened."
21,"What kind of complaint is that ""I was told I was free to leave and take my business elsewhere! Unacceptable! I'm going to leave and take my business elsewhere!"""
22,"So basically, they just got their license plate flagged as part of a theft and possibly reported to the police for nothing, all because they weren't smart enough to measure their escape vehicle before attempting to make off with the biggest TV they could grab."
23,"&gt;F:  I'm a lawyer,  

A. ""No, you're not."" 

&gt; I know my rights!

6. ""No, you don't.""

&gt; You can't refuse a sale!

iii. ""Yes, we can.""

...And that's strike 3 to retire the side with this game probably going into extra innings...

"
24,"That's awesome! Unfortunately the stuff that people leave is usually broken crap, so we don't really have a use for it. I can't believe you're not allowed to throw stuff out though. 16 years is ridiculous. Is it stuff people have paid for?"
25,Ban. Eject. Disassociate. Strike-out.
26,"You handled that REALLY well. Especially if you were, as you put it, ""fat and hormonal."" That'd really mess with ANYONE'S attitude, and you still remained more calm than I ever could on a good day."
27,That's what saves most of us. The answer to everything is always blame the machines.
28,"You know the truly frightening thought? *How did she get there?* Probably by operating a two-ton death machine that requires critical thinking and decision-making skills in order to avoid killing people.

Never fails to worry me when someone has true difficulty navigating a pin pad or basic English words, but then they'll go and get into their car and drive off."
29,My macaroni bracelet is real jewelry and if anyone says otherwise they can choke on it.
30,You guys hiring? 
31,"There really, really needs to be an exam people have to take before they have children..... I pray she didn't actually put one in his mouth and put him at risk of choking before she figured out that pretzel bites aren't for 4 month old babies."
32,"No. Not if the child is only 4 months old. She shouldn't have tried to feed them to him. Instead, she can eat them."
33,"A similar thing happened to me at work yesterday. I work in a frozen yogurt store and this woman got her son the wrong yogurt and thought she wouldn't have to pay to get him a new one. Was pretty upset when I asked her to hand over her sons yogurt.

Edit: fun fact, she tried to hand me back the other yogurt that was half eaten and full of toppings thinking I could do something with it. I asked her to throw it out. I do believe she kept it. "
34,"Sounds like hell, I'm american"
35,"Reminds me of the time in college I went to leave the house one morning and found my bike was stolen. I'm standing in the doorway on the phone with campus security to report it, and I see a kid ride by on the sidewalk on my bike. I chase after and get him to stop, and during the confrontation I look up and there is a cop driving down the street. I wave him down, explain what's going on, the cop starts asking questions and the kid gets all flustered. Cop just says ""just give the bike back and you won't get arrested"". So I got my bike back 15 minutes after I discovered it was stolen.

It got stolen again a year later"
36,"That's actually the specific reason I keep my computer angled toward me so I have time to turn the computer back if any customers try and get a hand in there. A lot of my coworkers will angle the computer towards them, presumably so the customer can see the total cost and what everything is ringing up as. I say bollocks to that, that's what the pinpad is there for. 

Full disclosure: I've never had this happen in the store work at and I've never heard of it happening until this post.  "
37,I don't understand why it's so difficult for people to carry ID. 
38,"&gt;She never came back in

Yet. Give it another few years."
39,"100%, I'd say. No-one buys £125 worth of iTunes vouchers when they only have £150 left to spend. "
40,Sounds about right. A person who comes that late without knowing what they want and having only the least accepted form of payment is the same person who loves to blame others for their idiocy.
41,Always wonderful when swift karma is served. 
42,"Well, to be fair, they didn't shoplift, they robbed the store at gunpoint - you're gonna need a fucking great store greeting to hold off something like that."
43,"She was pretty angry, but there was really nothing we could do. The owner came out and told her that we would look through his gold melting stuff and see if he happened to keep it around (we knew he didn't). She never came back in, but she obviously wasn't spending any money there anyway. We honestly felt bad that her piece was gone, but we tried."
44, They drink the koolaid where they're told acknowledging the customer means they're less likely to shoplift because they're noticed.
45,So she thought you would just give them another yogurt AND let them keep the one they have now?  I thought he didn't like it?  What happens when he doesn't like this one?  The one after?  I'm sorry lady but $5.00 doesn't buy you infinite FroYo!
46,You mean to tell me you aren't `H I G H E N E R G Y`? How are you going to make America great again?
47,"&gt;  As parents, it's your job to lay down appropriate rules to keep your kids out of places they shouldn't be.

Yea but that would mean actually having to do *something*. "
48,...how.. are people.. this stupid?
49,"I understand it's clever, but how did she think she was going to get away with it? It's all digital and you have the transaction record on the computer"
50,"We used to scan student ID cards at my fraternity parties, so we could keep an accurate guest list (small school). A surprising amount of people would show up without it and throw a fit. The best part, this card is how you got back into the dorms."
51,We're outsourcing our energy and making mexico pay for it
52,"""Manager is in back doing managerial things.""

Translation - they were playing candy crush and checking out their employees Facebook pages. 

Source:  am a manager"
53,should sell it to people who make their own jewelry.  I can melt down silver and pewter to make costume jewelry.
54,"Well, she doesn't have that game to play so may as well take up yelling at strangers. Or watching other people yell at strangers.

Now that I think about it, why didn't she stay home and watch reality tv?"
55,until they rise up against us.
56,"Wow, daily life must be freaking hard for him"
57,Well obviously you were holding the bags in the magical back all for yourselves and you just didn't want to give one to her personally! The injustice!
58,What's 86?
59,"I had this exact same scenario happen with a 1TB Hard Drive for data recovery.

She was pissed when we had fragged it after three years."
60,"In 10 years, when the jeweler has retired and his shop is closed, some lady will wander into the fast food joint now at that location and demand to get compensated for her missing ring."
61,You should've called the police and tried to get him charged with battery for throwing the basket at you. That behavior is completely unacceptable.
62,"My mom was probably there. 

I can almost guarantee you they probably juiced it all into a punchbowl and then started banging on some drums in a circle "
63,Get me your manager.
64,I took note of the time of the transaction. And put a note of it in my till so it will get passed to my manager. I wasn't sure if I should but something about it unnerved me. The shop was so busy and I thought if I didn't make a note of it I'd forget to tell him. I'm really glad you posted that now. 
65,I just don't understand why people go to so much effort to try to save a little money.
66,"I really, really wanted this to have a good ending where she returned and bought the system and everything went well... but nope, customers gotta do things like that!"
67,"I'm 62 years old...and I buy cigarettes for my husband.  I had to get a PA. State ID in order to buy  'em.  And...believe me...I sure as hell look 62, I look like a cross between a snapping turtle and a bulldog.  "
68,"""Welcome to game store, where we shoot all robbers, how can I help you?"""
69,"Heh.  I was working at the old CowPuters chain of stores, selling all the hot new gadgets: 4mp cameras!  128mb flash drives (at a dollar per mb, basically)!  52"" flat screen tvs!  You remember them, right?  

I had been keeping an eye on a kid, maybe 20 years old, who was acting like he was the featured article of the newest issue of ""Cliched Thief Monthly"".  Only way it could have been more obvious was if he was wearing a stocking mask and carrying a sack over his shoulder.

I made sure everybody on staff was aware of him, and after about 20 minutes he realized that the jig was up.  So he grabbed a display camera, yanked it free from the table (setting off the loudest damn alarm ever), and made a dash for the door....

...at which point the plainclothes police officer who was shopping reached out, grabbed his arm, and steered him directly into the nearest wall at running speed.

End heist.  Cue officer getting a nice discount."
70,"""I will never shop here again""

Ok, see you next Tuesday."
71,Not for nothing. They still stole from the store. Whether they leave the stolen TV in the bushes next to the store or take it home/wherever doesn't matter.
72,My family has a motorcycle shop. We had a bike sitting in the corner gathering dust for SEVEN YEARS!  My dad didn't want to bother filing paperwork on it so it just sat there. One day the customer showed up and explained that he had been in jail the whole time. He was almost crying when he realized his bike was still here. We let him go with paying off his seven year old bill. My dad felt for the guy and waved the storage fees. 
73,"I guess she didn't know about the post void function, and that once it was done it was done. "
74,I meant nothing as in no profit on their part. I'm aware there will be consequences for them once their plate is reported as part of the theft.
75,Damn straight. The friggin' store can't resell them... they're yours now...
76,"or we usually get ""I've got a gift card but I've left it at home! Can't you just take my word for it?"" "
77,Other manager needs to be shot out of a cannon. This makes my blood boil.
