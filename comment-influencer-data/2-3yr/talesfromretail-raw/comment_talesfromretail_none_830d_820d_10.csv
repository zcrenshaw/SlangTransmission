0,Wait he didn't get charged for attempted murder (I mean trying to hit you with a car could kill you) or at least assault?! I feel he should have gotten charged for the fact he attempted at the least to hurt you. 
1,"Meanwhile, the mother is thinking ""Is she a stripper?"""
2,"Tip: Get a sock puppet, make a manager name tag for it, use it when needed with a slightly overly gleeful voice and an opening like ""well hi there young man, I heard you wanted to speak to the manager!"" You can even interact back, ""That's right Mr. Melvin (or whatever), he seems confused about our return policy"". "
3,"Oh god...that's a completely different story...  
I used to go get groceries after work about once or twice a week. A cashier at the grocery store once mentioned the sparkles and I was nonchalantly all, ""Oh, it's from work.""  
They made this weird face and I immediately started trying to explain it was from my craft store."
4,"She tried to catch you on autopilot, I guess."
5,"I can't be bothered to read a sign, so $@%# your unrelated supplies! I'm a child in a grown-up's body!"
6,Spineless managers are one of the reasons there are customers like this.
7,"&gt;Apparently my manager had dealt with her before and she was just as difficult. 

I really wish we could show this to every new manager. When you stop giving in to customers that just throw fits to get their way you stop having to deal with customers that throw fits to get their way."
8,"Seems like free weights would be $0/lb.

Yes, I have two kids,why do you ask?"
9,"I had a little girl tell me I  looked like someone famous. I asked her if she was thinking of Johnny Depp.

""No,"" she replied, "" Hagrid."""
10,"&gt;Some people even have the balls to tell me the sign is misleading,

&gt;when in fact it's that they just aren't reading.

Then they see the total, and tell me: ""Go to hell"". 

Now who, not what, is the real dumbbell?"
11,What a great dad. 10/10. Plus that kid sounds like he has a fantastic taste in shoes. 
12,"""What do you mean the prices are in the computer? Is this not 1982 anymore?"" "
13,"If you're gonna quote the ADA don't forget to add the part relevant to the OP... the part that says if the dog is disruptive (barks, urinates in the store, is aggressive to others or generally is not under control of the handler) the DOG can be excluded from the store.  The person has to be allowed back in without the dog.  "
14,"Assault with a lethal weapon, maybe?"
15,"Never having been to the weights section of a sporting goods store, I had no idea that weights would be priced like that. TIL!"
16,"Straight from www.ada.gov faq

Q7. What questions can a covered entity's employees ask to determine if a dog is a service animal?
A. In situations where it is not obvious that the dog is a service animal, staff may ask only two specific questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability? and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform? Staff are not allowed to request any documentation for the dog, require that the dog demonstrate its task, or inquire about the nature of the person's disability."
17,Attempted vehicular man slaughter?
18,No charges for attempting to kill you?
19,As a guy who worked in the retail section of Cracker Barrel I would get glitter in my beard from the Christmas decorations that stuck around through Valentine's Day.
20,Do they just expect each of us to follow them around the store warning them of every possible inconvenience coming their way?
21,"Before you said he was high, I was already reading his lines in Cheech's voice lol"
22,"He kinda shut up after I told him I'm the manager, not worth writing his grumbled walk out."
23,Also don't forget that Emotional Support Animals are not covered by the ADA and can be asked to leave the store.
24,"I love when pain-in-the-ass customers threaten us wage slaves with going to the competition.

25,I think what really annoyed me also was that he just threw the  toothpicks into the trash. At least if you're going to take them you should use them and not be so wasteful
26,"40 years later, her remains would be discovered behind the clearance section, the words 'I KNOW you carry it, and I WILL find it' scrawled in the dust next to her bones."
27,"I'm not a lawyer but I *think* that would be murder, not manslaughter. The attempt is intention, versus manslaughter which is usually an unintended consequence of some other action.

Either way, fuck that guy."
28,I feel like this anecdote ends too soon.
29,"Just had someone do this to us in the middle of a rush -- it was a huge pain in the ass.

At our store, cashiers are *supposed* to keep the bills out (but behind the counter out of reach) until the customer's change is counted out. That way, if the customer accuses the cashier of short-changing them, the cashier is able to pick up the customer's bills and count it out again. Said cashier in this situation didn't do that, and put the bills straight into the till."
30,Press charges.   
31,"See, I would figure your Valentine's Day decorations would have glitter too and start the cycle over again. There weren't many holidays that were glitter-free."
32,"Not that I've heard of. I had to give a statement to the police about what happened of course, and then my manager said he'd tell me once they've contacted the store again"
33,Screw that :D
34,"Oh how I understand your pain... I too once had an issue with a lady and vanilla ice cream. We had two vanillas, a plain one and one with caramel and nuts. Busy day, I was taking money and orders with little chance to breathe. She says 'vanilla'. I give her a scoop.

'I asked for vanilla and nuts.' My eye twitches.
'You said vanilla, mam'. She replies 'yes, but I pointed at this one'.

She pointed. Of course she did. While I was at the register, clearly not looking at the ice cream or the whereabouts of her index finger, because I haven't been blessed with chameleon eyes.

I swear vanilla flavours are cursed."
35,I am dying for this skit. 
36,"I had a lady do this to me in drive through of a fancy fast food place many years ago.

She ordered, pulled up and flashed a few 20s to make sure I saw them, then handed me a $10.

I did the same - ""out of 10, your change is xxx.""

Trying to mask a smug look on her face with outrage, she exclaims that she handed me a $20 and, after all, i knew she had a $20 because she waved them around.

Manager audit = 3 cents off.  I win."
37,"I once had to put ~10 ""no cash out"" signs on the one machine because people would ignore them and try to get money out. It was infuriating. Not to mention the people who move a sign out of the way to put money in."
38,"There is a guy that comes into work, he does something similar. When we tell him something he doesn't like, he says ""I am not talking with you"". Very rude. We have kicked him out on a number of occasions. "
39,"When he open palm slapped that TV, he probably rubbed his Zamboni oil onto it."
40,"I kinda feel bad for that girl. She had a good attitude about learning and didn't get confrontational like a lot of customers would have, and I would hope she had someone at home to enforce those qualities. Even with the mistake she made, I know most people here would take her over certain other types of customers in a heartbeat. "
41,Mathematics majors don't count. Source: math major friend who loved thinking deeply about obscure math concepts but hated arithmetic. 
42,"Hey, better to be Hagrid than Dolores Umbridge. "
43,"Voluntary manslaughter is murder that is mitigated because the defendant flew into a sudden fit of passion or rage. Murder requires malice aforethought. 

Law student in the states. Precise definitions vary by jurisdiction. "
44,100% chance he isn't a lawyer. 
45,I like your manager.
46,"C: ""I want to speak to the manager!!!""

You: ""I'll get the manager for you, he's in the back room""

YOU Walk into the back room, then YOU come back out""

You "" I just spoke with the employee, and he said you had an issue""

I have also done this, and came back out, and told them I'm the owner..


Always fun."

48,"I don't understand some people's logic. I remember in college, I had a coupon that was $15off $50. So, I saw my friend bought something for $45. I told her if she spend another $5, she could use my coupon. But her response was, ""I don't need that $5 item."" If she used my coupon, it would essentially make her original purchase $35 and the $5 item would've been free."
49,"You're a wizard harry.

I'm a what

A wizard

I can't be a wizard. I'm just harry

No just harry you're a wizard.

A what

A wizard harry.

But I can't be a wizard harry, I'm just harry.

NO I'm just harry, you, you're a wizard harry!

50,"That guy is an ass, but I'm curious to know why your shop doesn't include a drink with a combo, I've never seen this. So is the combo just the main dish (sandwich or whatever) and a side? Is there something unique about the drinks you sell (such as a smoothie or coffee) that explains why they wouldn't be included in the combo? Is this a chain fast food place or independent? I have so many questions!"

52,Loving the code word here
53,"People are allowed to have bad days, that doesn't excuse attempted murder or bodily harm though. "
54,"The going rate for free weights is about $1/lb., so you'll usually see 5lb. dumbbells priced for $5. I've never seen a general $/lb sign for weights before, though."
