0,Some kids know how to raise a parent :)
1,Unless we're going to have robots running retail stores there will always have to be *someone* there. Why look down on them? It just makes no sense. Do these people have nothing better to do than to go around trying to make people feel bad?
2,"I literally just sipped my coffee afterward and thought ""man this has to be a new record for me."" 

I have now had: A squirrel take out the power, a fire down the hall, a gun scare (someone actually lit fireworks in the food court), and now a woman draw a knife on another woman.  "
3,only the first 5 minutes? new record!
4,"&gt;Apparently Customer Service told the woman that next time she can wait in line, and that we will not make any exceptions to help her out again.

Its nice when they have your back like that!"
5,"Oh, that's beautiful. Can you update us when they try to come back and find out their membership has been suspended?  If possible, could you also get a picture of what I'm sure has to be their constant smug, self-satisfied expressions dropping from their faces? That would be so satisfying."
6,So maybe the mother (or father?) should give the daughter the missing $10.
7,"The sweetest part, to me, is that you just know the kid hears that at home, about putting away her toys or something like that. There's about a 3% chance a kid that age came up with ""You think that's acceptable?"" on her own, she's got to be getting that from somewhere - probably her mother. That makes me smile at this a little more."
8,"It's a shame that in that line of work, the first thing you think of in that situation is a complaint, vice being commended. "
9,"I suffer from Resting Bitch Face,  in so a lot of people think mean and nasty when looking at me. In truth,  I'm considered one of the nicer people in my store."
10,"I love how they always think *they're* the ones who are being robbed, when they want a discount for everything."
11,"That is impressive. Seriously, I can't barely keep my discount card for two years without something happening for it, and here this guy has a laminated business card."
12,"I think I'm a customer. I read 15/10/5/2 as a date. Several times. Send help, and my coupons. "
13,"Had a guy today ask if I had a card, said ""Not on me,"" he opened his drawer and grabbed a new one attached to a form, and I was just about to tell him no thanks when he scanned it, then tossed it back in the drawer.

Saved me $3."
14,"I had a customer come to my store (car stereo shop) and request a quote for a product with install, needed it installed TODAY. They had 3 written quotes already from my competitors, all within $10 for a $200 job. I looked at the quotes, beat the lowest one by a cent, $199.99, and asked for their keys.

They told me they were shopping around, and were going to check out the other places to see if they're cheaper.

""Sir, you've spent 4 hours and driven 30 miles, and all of the quotes are within $10. This is just how much it costs. You're here now, why not just get this over with?""

""I need to be sure I'm getting the best deal.""

He came back hours later, 20 minutes before closing. Informed me we were the lowest price and he wanted us to do the work.

I had to inform him we're done for the day and not accepting cars, but if he absolutely needs it done, we can stay late for a $100 fee (aka, he's buying us dinner).

He scoffed and said he was going to No. 2 on his list. I reminded him we're the only one in the county that's open, and no one is open the next day (a Sunday).

So, he paid the $100 extra."
15,"Actually, that's a pretty standard response, if not worded exactly that way.  The terrible part is that I got talked to by my boss after one such exchange because I ""didn't explain to the customer the benefits of joining our program,"" despite his being very clearly not interested."
16,"Exactly. I'm just not sure why she mentioned it to me, I can't do anything about their daughter not having enough money."
17,"&gt; Customer: well my daughter only has $10 Me:ok.

That is *exactly* the sort of thing I tend to say. Inside I'm thinking ""I don't know why you gave me this unrelated fact."" until much later when I figure it out."
18,And nothing burns as bad as a kid scolding you with your own words.
19,"They visit multiple locations it seems, but I already plan to keep an eye out :)"
20,She was flustered that she got caught trying to buy a cheaper type of bread and wanted to make a scene so you'd forget and move on. 
21,Sounds like a busy day. I wonder what will happen in the second hour.
22,"Could germaphobic people just stop eatting out? I don't mean reasonable people that want their food handled in a clean, safe and hygienic manner. I mean people like in OP' s story. People who don't think that the huge amount of FDA regulations is enough. Just make your own food please."
23,"You know that girl is wise beyond her years, too.

""*As a daughter of a 34 years old mother, I believe that...*""
"
24,I worked somewhere that had a policy of carding anyone who appeared to be under the age of 99. It was fun having little old ladies tease that they'd be offended on the day we finally stopped carding them.
25,"I also have a deep voice and used to work fast food.  All people ever said to me about it is that they thought I should work in radio because it would be a good radio voice.  And sometimes choir people would ask if I could do choir because I guess they like having someone with a deep voice.  I declined, can't sing anyway."
26,"Such a strange mentality. I mean, it might work if you're at a yard sale or something, it's the end of the day, and they just want the crap _gone_... but an actual business?

"
27,"I love the ""I'm never coming back here again"" part. "
28,"I know many people who are currently working in jobs that have absolutely zero to do with what they got a degree in at school.  Its a crappy job market, people do what they can get hired doing.  This is why I work in a call center.  People over 50 have no grasp on what its like in the job market these days.  I'm in my late thirties and a few years back I was looking for work and my mom kept asking me why I didn't just drive around to places and ask if they're hiring.  I said well... because this is 2016 and people don't do that anymore.  Its all email and internet applications.  Just because I sit at home while unemployed and spend 4 hours online job hunting doesn't mean I'm not trying to find a job.  Guess what, in that 4 hours I applied to 40 jobs.  She still doesn't get it."
29,I've seen a number of cashiers do this. The funny secondary effect is it messes with the company's tracking algorithms when that card is actually issued to someone.
30,"&gt;I'm gonna need you to make this quick, my girls get out of school in five minutes.

I swear that's code for me to go as slow as possible at this point in my retail servitude. These people are usually so goddamn rude and unreasonable too...

Ah, also you have to put the symbol first on the line you are typing on so it could format properly. :) So like this:

SYMBOLGOESHEREMe: now put your words here"
31,"You had me locked in at ""One rips off the other's weave..."""
32,"&gt; is there anyone else we can talk to about discounting the dress?

I find this common statement so insulting and condescending, that whenever I'm out shopping and overhear it, I always get the urge to do something like the following:

ME: Me, I'll talk to you about it.

CUSTOMER: That dress is $20, but my daughter only has $10.

ME: OK.

CUSTOMER: Well, can we get a discount?

ME: Probably not. I don't work here.

CUSTOMER: THEN WHY ARE YOU WASTING MY TIME?

ME: Well, I was willing to talk to you about it."
33,"Kind of a relevant situation, I work at an outdoor birding store, (little background), we sell pole systems as well as bird seed (the lifeblood of our store. We also sell specialty gift items such as bird baths, benches, and much more.

Anywho, So a few weeks ago a lady came to our store looking for a pole system to watch birds *nothing out of ordinary*, I converse with her about twenty minutes describing our pole system and all the features that it has. She buys the system and a feeder to go along with it. (We also have a $25 member system that she signed up for.) 

Two days later while I am working, we get a phone call and my co-worker said that there was a lady on the phone looking for me. She called to say thank you so much for recommending the system (feeders + seed included). She told me that she has seen so many birds and new birds at her system and said that she will now come to our store every week to get bird seed and possibly more feeders. I told her thank you for calling me and telling me this, and that it made my day. Needless to say that was a big morale boost for me. "
34,"Benefits include; 2-5 minutes of wasted time filling out application giving us your personal information, 5-30 seconds wasted time while you locate, pull out, and return your card from/to your wallet every time you purchase something, getting daily spam emails describing these benefits to you even though you checked the box to not get them, 2-5 minutes of wasted time convincing customer service that you did indeed check the box to not get emails, knowing the cost of store items went up to counter the cost of printing out millions of plastic cards, having your personal information sold to the highest bidder so that they can send you emails explaining the benefits of getting their loyalty card too, etc."
35,"I'd normally make a joke about how he expected you to read his mind, but I'm afraid he doesn't have anything in there to be read."
36,"Completely agree.  LPT for any retail management, bending company policy for irate customers only teaches the customer that your front line staff are useless and unable to help them.  Unless that's the message your trying to send, I'd avoid it at all costs.  Plus, then your employees know you have their back."
37,BUT WHY DOESN'T YOUR COFFEE TASTE LIKE TEA???
38,"Ma'am the store is on fire! Leave or burn to death I don't care, have a nice day."
39,"Coupons have their limits, and sadly sometimes people find glitches or ways to work-around those limits on self checkout registers. An extra coupon here and there won't really matter, but sometimes people try to get away with much worse.


I can't go into too much detail, but they were abusing the really good manufacturer coupons (nearly free items, etc) on self checkout, dropping different coupons than what they scanned, etc. It's not terribly common, since it would be dumb for someone to risk their PAID membership, but it happens once in a while. These people were just scummy though and the type to complain and get their way whenever they can. Glad I could shut that down :)"
40,"We may not be able to enforce Darwin's Law any more, but thank God for Stupid Tax."
41,"You mean vending machines? Yeah, I'd love dealing with those rather than human beings who aren't limited to a single function and are actually capable of working around an unexpected issue..."
42,"Same here, I'm the general manager at my store and my staff, especially the newer ones, have a real hard time reading me at times. I take efforts to alleviate this when I'm dealing with customers but if I'm just in the zone doing whatever I tend to look super pissed off at everything and everyone. "
43,I absolutely love it when people ask for my name and say they are going to call corporate. Like do you think they care that you didn't get your fucking adult diapers on sale that ended two weeks ago. 
44,"&gt;never to return.

You should be so lucky."
45,"BECAUSE IT ALREADY TASTES LIKE CHOCOLATE

... oh wait"
46,"I have an expired coupon, but I talked to somebody at a different store who said I could use it! Are you refusing to serve me?"
47,"""Where's mom, she was supposed to be here 30 minutes ago?!""

""I don't know, probably being a bitch to someone."""
48,Good Lord. Your manager is so blind he can't see how much money they lost in bruised bananas.
49,"Last time I had a yard sale, I had a bunch of old drinkware out for 50p a piece.  This lady came up and proudly proclaimed she would pay me 50p for *everything on the fucking table*.

If she wanted to do 50p for, say, two pieces, maybe I would have been inclined to do so.  But for 20 glasses?"
50,"She did say her grand daughter was gifted, not her."
51,"Someone once called the store manager on me. 
I was working the express line, due to tendonitis in my wrist. A woman comes with a full cart, which I didn't notice until she was next. Whatever. I ring her through so she doesn't have to go to another line, but I politely alert her that next time, if she has a full cart that she can't use the express line. She got pissed off, asked for my name, which I told her was on her receipt.

The next day, I was called to the manager office. 

M: did you have a situation yesterday?

Me: ugh.. I don't think so?

M: did you tell a woman she couldn't use the express line?

Me: oh yeah. She had almost a full cart. 

M: well she said that she was embarrassed when you said that, and that people looked at her.

I actually got written up for that. Fuck that place though. "
52,When I was looking for my first job (at about 16) my mom made me go and spend a day driving to different stores to job hunt. They all looked at me like I had two heads and told me to fill out the online applications.
53,Fantastic. I wish I could do this at my store. My store automatically scans the clearance price at the register.
54,"There used to be a sign in some pubs that said something along the lines of ""Credit will only be given to patrons over 80 accompanied by both parents""."
55,"""Ok,we have other clothes $10 and under that will fit your budget."""
56,My parents hate it when I do it to them. I think it's funny

59,Especially because they never follow through on that.
60,"The Bad: You had a crazy customer who resonated with another crazy customer.

The Good: They may have found their life-long soul-mates.

The Other Bad: They might breed."
61,"They usually don't. Wish they did though, it would relieve some stress "
62,"SIR I ALREADY TOLD YOU I'M NOT A COUPON PERSON. YOU'RE REFUSING TO DISCOUNT ME, SO I'M TAKING MY BUSINESS ELSEWHERE"
63,"Isn't it amazing how quickly people jump right to ""you should be fired"". It could be your first day, you could be dealing with an invisible handicap, you could have just found out that someone close to you died. But how dare you make some slight mistake in their service, that fact that you did that means that you should lose any ability to support yourself and give back to society."
64,Now that is a loyal customer! Send him some coupons too lol
65,"&gt; ... proclaimed she would pay me 50p for everything on the fucking table.

""No you won't."""
66,Take notes kids. *This* is how you act as a store owner.
67,"""You're a manager! You must know _every single item in the entire store_"""
68,"For my store at least, the card we scan for discounts when people don't want their own card is already activated and marked on so that employees know not to give it away. "
69,This is so cute! I wish I had costumers this nice at my store!
