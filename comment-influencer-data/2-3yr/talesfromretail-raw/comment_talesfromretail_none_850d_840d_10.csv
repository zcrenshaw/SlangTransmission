0,This is much cuter than what I was expecting! Good on you for helping that mom and son out in their hard times!
1,"I guess you could say that the fix was a piece of cake.

I'll see myself out...

Edit: Thanks to the person who anonymously gave me gold :3"
2,"After she said, ""Uh, ew! I have a boyfriend."" you could have replied, ""Good for you. So do I."" and it would have been smooth sailing."
3,"Dude you saved his dissertation, I would have bought you cake too

It may have been simple to you, but it wasn't probably a lifeline to that customer. Good work, enjoy the cake "
4,"&gt;so I assume that he's coming to apologise for his behaviour.

You must be new at this."
5,"Parents seem to think they're exempt from the rule.

They're not."
6,"You sound awesome. I love people with a dry, sarcastic sense of humor"
7,This is much sadder than I was expecting. 
8,"The ""10 items or less"" and ""card only"" signs involve reading, which would've been too much for his tiny brain to handle."
9,"It's easy to see where her daughter learned that behavior. Kids that age are basically sponges for everything their parents do, and her mother certainly isn't providing a good role model. "
10,"Not that I hope you'll ever have to use it, but if you do need to find a customer's postal code for some reason Canada Post has a [free public tool](https://www.canadapost.ca/cpo/mc/personal/postalcode/fpc.jsf) that will let you find a postal code given an address. Granted, you still need the *address*, so if they can't tell you that then they're probably out of luck..."
11,"Well, her reading level and maturity both agree, she belongs back in grade school."
12,"I've done that before, and then she started apologizing profusely and told me she wasn't a homophobe, but just tired of guys hitting on her all the time... I don't think many guys were hitting on her at all"
13,Time to do some big brother volunteer work! (even if you don't good on you)
14,"1. You aren't a bank. 

2. Don't trust a bank not to give you a counterfeit bill, they slip through sometimes. 

3. I wouldn't have shown her those notes either. Good on you to keep your till secure. Not worth the risk, and then losing the job. "
15,"I once worked for a major department store. 

The District Manager had a saying to make sure we understood how to handle returns. 

He said: 

&gt;If a customer comes in with a tire and said that they purchased a ring. We will find a way to give them a return for a ring. 

Over my years there I've had to suck up my pride and return ridiculous stuff. Here's a couple of examples:

A customer bought a North Face Jacket and not even half an hour later came back to the very same register he purchased it from with an obviously old North Face jacket (it was dirty and even had a hole). And I could only make a couple of comments that let him know I understand what he was doing and then processed the return.

A customer came back with a competitors store brand item and no receipt. I told them which store they bought it from. Showed it to them on their store website. *I was a lead in my department and even if I wasn't you could easily tell it wasn't our product.* Then was yelled at and told to get my manager. 

The manager's response? 

u/Anch0rless, you need to be more compliant and try harder to work with the customers. Just process the return. 

She gave the customer store credit and left without apologizing to me with the knowledge that it wasn't even our product. 

I've kept my backbone on a few occasions because I had being made for a fool but christ I don't know how that store stays in business operating that way. 

There are so many people who try to game the system. It's ridiculous. I'm glad you guys are able to tell a customer to piss off and backed by management to do so. "
16,"That is actual assault, and he should have been escorted out of the store immediately. When he threatened you to come outside, you should have called the police."
17,"&gt; I'll see myself out...

Get back here and take your goddamn upvote."
18,"So, she gets all bent out of shape over a drive through headset malfunctioning, something that happens quite often and is easy to deal with by either being patient or driving around and ordering, and starts acting like a four year old giving the silent treatment because of it, and you're the idiot? 

I beg to differ."
19,"After that, I just wouldn't serve her, period. You two work in the same store, and it's called respect for the individual. "
20,"""Let me just get my wallet""


who the hell walks into a store without their wallet???"
21,Who's cutting gummy worms in here?
22,"I feel like managers who allow those kinds of returns are only helping con artists, not actual customers."
23,"Congrats on your recent move. How have you enjoyed these past two years in Manitoba?


/s"
24,"As a proud cat father, I can say that I have literally done this. A small gentle bite of his paw and you would have thought it was a complete amputation and replacement with a new paw. He sat there just staring at his paw in disbelief. He was much more gentle for the rest of the day."
25,It's really sad when you realize your 4 year old nephew is more mature than the grown customers in some of these stories. 
26,"If I had lost my dissertation past the halfway point I think I would have just broken. Like, just full on mental break.

This was worth way more than a cake to that person."
27,"""Do as I say, not as I do."""
28,"Dang, I was kinda hoping the daughter would've been smarmy at the mom and reminded her that 'whining won't get you what you want', but then we might've been entering $100% territory."
29,WHY WOULD YOU BE TALKING ABOUT SEX TOYS WITH YOUR DAUGHTER AND THINK THEM BEING ID'D IS THE WEIRDEST PART OF THAT CONVERSATION??????? 
30,PIVOT!!!
31,"&gt; for the rest of the day

cat: ""that's enough behaving for me"""
32,Smoke signals? Don't be silly. She wants you to use magic
33,"I do phone tech support.  I get this daily.

""May I have your zip code please?""

""123""

""That's likely the area code part of your phone number.  May I have your zip code please?""

""1234""

""That's likely the security code on your account or the last 4 of your social security number.  May I have your zip code please?""

They do not engage brain.  Ever.  It's painful for them."
34,"It was sad, but also reassuring that OP was willing to do that act of kindness for a child he didn't know at all. It's a nice change to this subreddit that renews my faith in humanity."
35,"That will be one thousand, four hundred and thirty seven cents sir"
36,"Even if, why be like that to this one specific guy? Saying ""Ew"" is inappropriate in any of these situations, even IF the guy is anything but your type."
37,"*sniper on roof aims at head*

I know your not stealing because we're watching you"
38,"A kid, maybe 10-12 years old, came in with his mom one day. He seemed to have Down's syndrome and was being 10000% more polite than most customers. I commented and thanked him for being so polite, he told me- ""you're supposed to be nice to everyone, even if you don't like them!"" 

I lost it, and thanked him for making my day better. He was such a cool kid. "
39,Yeah really thankful OP did the right thing in that situation and played along instead of doing what I'd fear most others would do as they'd probably try to push the kid off. 
40,"To be fair i would have said similar. The child probably would have replied back with ""dont be silly"" 

Im a parent. Am i bad with children too?"
41,"I live with a special needs roommate.  Most of the time she can pass as 'normal' to the people around her, but she can't process certain types of information at all, including addresses.

If she ever got lost, even a block away from the house she wouldn't be able to find her way back.  It may not be the case that the person in this story has the same situation, but sometimes there are reasons why people appear to be obtuse."
42,That's still good to know! I'll keep it in mind for future dilemmas
43,"If he thinks ordering in ounces instead of pounds makes him so much smarter than the rest of the world, I question if he was intelligent enough to graduate from high school. Because that's the sort of thinking my 7 year old niece has when she's trying to sound super smart, not any adults I know. I mean, it's fine to order in ounces, but the minute you start acting like it makes you so much smarter, that's when I start questioning your intelligence. 

Edit: My niece isn't a spoiled brat or condescending or anything, she just thinks it makes her sound smarter when she says things like 'My aunt got a new feline' or 'I like lots of saccharides in my tea'. But she's 7, not a grown adult."
44,"Reminds me of the time an old lady threw a can of cat food at my head over a 15 cent difference between 2 brands. It hit my shoulder, she stormed out without her precious change...so I excused myself from the customer service desk and followed her out to her car. After I handed her the 2 coins (which she hurled into the open trunk of her car) she started yelling at me about how incompetent I was, how terrible the store was, etc.  I smiled a huge smile and for the first (and so far only) time in my life had an immediate comeback which wasn't profanity or inappropriate for work: ""I hope the rest of your day is as pleasant as you are!"". Marched right back to my register and finished the line before dissolving into a panic attack."
45,"In my store we have a basket till instead of a proper ten items of less thing but I get people with trolleys all the time through mistake or my letting them in.

One customer came up behind some other basket customers and load on their stuff. Seeing as no-one was behind them I didn't mind but at the end of the transaction I brought up that it was basket only. She responds ""Oh sorry. You guys should have a sign about that."" I point to the cardboard sign sat on the end of my till to which she responds, ""Oh you should make it a lot bigger than that then."" I then point to the Giant sign hanging from the (not at all high) ceiling saying 'Basket Only'. To which she then responds ""People might not look up and see that though, you should have something the customer will easily see."" I then grab the very divider they had put before their shopping and it says ""Basket Only"". She shut up after that."
46,"""you finally said something useful"" ... I would.have fucking lost it"
47,That's what I was thinking while watching her act straight up childish over cat food 😂. 
48,Sounds like she needs to lighten up. 
49,Now I need gummy worms 
50,"Everyone has trouble with laptops and know how hard it can be when you need to spend a major chunk of your savings/hard earned money to get a new one! The fix might have been really simple but for him, you were a savior. Enjoy the cake ;)"
51,"I mean, if you got halfway through your dissertation without backing it up somewhere maybe you shouldn't be graduating. That just seems like natural selection to me."
