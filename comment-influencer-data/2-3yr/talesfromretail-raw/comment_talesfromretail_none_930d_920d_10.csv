0,Manager +1
1,What a ditch.
2,"Man, businesses really need to stop doing this.  Obviously, this lady knew that most businesses will bend over rather than risk doing the right thing and making their customers adhere to simple rules.  I would have loved to know what school she teaches at just to make a stink with her bosses over what type of idiots they hire."
3,"&gt; The customer didn't return

Would you look at that. I can just imagine him getting home, seeing that ad, stomping his feet and muttering 'but, but, but the customer is always right!'"
4,+100 Loyalty
5,"I do not understand why people who believe their religion is the greatest/most powerful on earth at the same time feel that a small pendant or other item is a serious threat to it. It seems both petty and ridiculous, and I see no need for people like this woman to make a big deal about something as simple as a necklace. "
6,"These are the people we learn about in math

Edit: a word "
7,"

+5 Intelligence

+5 Wisdom

+5 Charisma"
8,"I am clearly old. It would never have occurred to either me or my mother for her to deal with my college books - part of being an adult was that I responsible for own education (after all, I was the one paying for it through scholarships, campus jobs, and loans, so why would I even WANT to pass off that responsibility to anyone else?). 

And this:

&gt;I need a note to give to my daughter's professor explaining why her homework is late

Not only would that have not flown with my mother, but my professors would have laughed me out of the building if I came in with a note from Mommy.
"
9,"Wait, so the guy was an employee of a company? Who was most likely on hourly pay, and was pissed because he had to wait? That's just free money."
10,And she sounds like the type that would be back screaming in your face for selling him a game that she was offended by. 
11,"glad that worked out so well, was definitely expecting temper tantrums"
12,"I call that lather, rinse, repeat, when you rinse their idiotic ramblings off your back and simply repeat your last statement.  Done it many times in the call center."
13,It's actually a *lack* of faith that causes this sort of reaction. 
14,"Last week I brought a package in to the local UPS store.  There were 5 people in front of me, which is pretty rare.  The reason?  The customer being helped had brought in her package and didn't want to pay for the shipping.  Because it was a return to Amazon, and that's always free.  She thought she could just walk into the store and say ""send it to Amazon!"" with no paperwork at all, and they would happily do it for her.  No matter how the employee tried explaining it, she just couldn't get it through her thick skull. "
15,"I worked in a call centre for 7 years and daily we'd have people complaining about being on hold for hours.

I'd simple reply with ""Oh, that's strange the monitoring system says there's a 0 second queue and I've been sitting available for a few minutes now. I better get someone to look into that."".

This would always defuse the situation and more often than not have them muttering something under their breaths about being right."
16,"All he kept saying was he was on a job and we were costing him money by having him wait for half an hour (which i eventually found out was a lie when i talked to the cashier who rang him up as to how long he was waiting).  My guess is he is paying other people hourly and they were waiting for him to get back which is why he was mad because people were just standing around waiting for him to get back while getting paid too.  It happens alot where I work, and people tend to embelish how long they have been waiting."
17,"Did you know the word santa has the same letters in it as...


Wait for it...


SATAN! (Dun-dun-dun ban Christmas)"
18,And yet she still shops with you guys.
19,I find that disturbing. 
20,Where was $DS???
21,"This goes beyond me. In my country no one haggles over anything. If it's $18, it's $18, take it or leave it. I can't even tell you what would happen if a grown ass adult threw a fit like this because it's completely unfathomable. 

Edit, spelling. "
22,Do customers feel shame? I hope this customer felt shame.
23,"Bad news travels much faster/further than good news, so thank you for sharing this little gem of joy."
24,"  I can picture it perfectly as the professor turns the note over, reads the date and makes an example of the student in front of the class for not buying the book sooner, and trying to pass of an excuse note when you hadn't bought the book until 3 full weeks of class had passed. That's how it would have gone down in most of my classes!  

There may have been one or two profs that would have had that conversation privately and not in front of everyone, or ask why you didn't make copies from someone else's books or ask the professor for help before trying to actually get out of doing something the lazy way! Those were the *nice* ones. "
25,I'm sure it hurts you on a deep emotional level that she took her business elsewhere.
26,"That awkward moment when the pentagram she mistook it for is actually a symbol of protection used by medieval catholics

Butch needs to learn some history"
27,"I'm sorry, you have to speak up. My BullshitAlarm™  is going off and it's quite loud.

"
28,"What would have made it better is if she was wearing a cross on a necklace.  
""Every one must know my religion and accept it as superior, but don't you dare show support or practice for other religions""

That kind of intolerance is shameful."
29,"Like I said, she's a regular! She's in almost every other week, I don't understand it..."
30,You can always tell a Milford man.
31,"I used to hate working in commercial sales or outside L&amp;G first thing in the morning, because we would get a lot of contractors that would act like this. I get that you have places to be, but you aren't exactly the only person in the store at the moment. Didn't matter if they had been waiting 2 minutes. We are awful for making them wait when they need to be on the jobsite already.

It was always hilarious though to be a little petite girl walking up on a group of a contractor and his workers waiting on an employee to come load for them. The looks on their faces. 9 times out of 10 they suddenly remembered they could load too. "
32,She should not be driving
33,Legit. That's quality service. I salute you. Anyone else would be pissed off and I unable to hold their temper.
34,"Did the AM sign on to the register under his ID, or leave it under yours? If the latter, an audit will show YOU as the one who lowered the price."
35,"""What do you mean you pulled me over officer because my child was at the wheel!? I don't tell you how to do your job, so don't tell me how to raise my kid!"""
36,"Honestly she probably doesn't pay attention, whatever keeps him busy"
37,"I quit a while ago, but I couldn't have gotten blamed for it anyway because only managers can lower the price.   "
38,"German.

I read all these TfR but most of them are completely alien to me. Like this one. Throw a tantrum to get a price changed? Good luck with that. Not going to happen. Not even a little bit. "
39,"That's called assault and if physical contact was made, battery.

I always find it reprehensible that management allows such behavior from any customer.
"
40,When I worked retail and a customer implying (or out right saying) I don't have a real job was one of the few things that silenced my fears of getting fired over talking back to customers.
41,such a good idea! going to do this. :) 
42,"I also was refused entry. What's your DM's email address so I can get a gift card as well? $50 feels about right. Actually, I don't know where your store is or what you sell, so just cash will do. Thanks!"
43,"Spineless manager is also two faced.

Nice find OP. Good thing you got out."
44,"Of course they feel shame, it's the denial of accepting it that causes these massive outbursts.

Can't feel embarrassed if you make yourself right with lots of yelling and pouting."
45,"How about you scoot your ass to another lane, Lady. Jfc"
46,"Certain computer programming languages, like PHP, perl, bash, and older BASIC dialects, use $ to denote a variable. This has led to computery people using $ to denote placeholders in more general circumstances."
47,"People should be happy they are allowed to return things in the first place. I work at a liquor store and while I can do returns, it's my decision. So if people act up they can leave. And reasons for returning should be good not ""I don't like this or I was gifted this"". "
48,Wow pharmacy is open but not the store?  Sounds like a huge hassle!  In the States they would just lie and say they have to use the pharmacy then do their shopping anyway.
49,"That's interesting. Although, I've only ever returned one thing to Amazon, they gave me the shipping label and just deducted the cost of shipping from the refund."
50,I always look for the line with the person having a seizure because it's always the shortest line.
51,That is literally the reason my aunt didn't let her kids believe in Santa Claus. 
52,"I can't get over how disproportionate that response is. Even if you were rude or casually insulting him, his response is...to assault you?  I mean it's not a bar fight, it's an employee you can easily report and (potentially) get them in trouble rather than going to jail over damaged pride. 

I wouldn't have bothered to continue the conversation after the first threat, just be like ""you would beat me up over that?"", then tell him you're calling the cops and his employer, and walk back inside. Your way worked well too, though."
53,"I have a feeling if that kid DID cut his hand, and you were there, she'd blame you for not watching him/telling him not to play with knives lol"
54,"&gt;Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. “Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. “And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.

~~James, 4:6~~ Mathews 6:1-8"
55,That door repair is gonna cost a lot more than the tiles she was so pissed about. 
56,Apparently it's *still* a symbol of protection. It protected OP's store from future dealings with a dingbat.
57,You know what brand and type of cymbal you have and after some use it will start getting dented and sometimes even cracked so every used cymbal is different.
58,"I love when Amish people shop at my store, they're always the nicest people to check out and help."
59,This ended better than expected and I'm glad for that.
60,"&gt; You: I would love to help you!

&gt; Lady: This is why you're going to close down!

Um, what exactly did she want you to do in that situation? Actually don't answer that, it sounds like the conversation went exactly as she planned. She just wanted an excuse to insult your bookstore."
61,"&gt;Me: So that's a total of €24,32.
Lady: No. 

My favourite part is that she doesn't even have an alternative, she just doesn't believe you. It's not like she did the math incorrectly and came up with another number and is now just confused, she just flat out doesn't believe your math."
62,"You loyal
"
63,"Congrats on the pregnancy, sir. ;)"
64,"""Ma'am, are you a registered student at this institution? No? Well I'm afraid we can only sell our products to registered students as that is the intended customer. If you know of one such have them come in and we will gladly order the book for them. Good day.""

.....is what I wish you could say. :P"
