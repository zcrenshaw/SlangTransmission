0,"&gt;TL:DR: No

Sums up retail and most posts on this sub

Edit: Holy S#it 1.1k updoots!!! :D"
1,It's the best thing ever when the manager agrees with you and shuts them down. Some people are so greedy and shady. It can be so frustrating but you can really laugh at their idiocy ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
2,I feel bad for her husband. Living with such a witch must be awful for his health.
3,"&gt; demanding hand soap or they would call corporate

""Please do, ensuring sufficient stock is corporate's problem, not mine."""
4,"No, this customer is not capable of finishing the job. In addition to two functioning arms, bagging groceries requires a functioning brain."
5,"In all my 8 years of retail experience, it is the managers job to handle difficult situations and customers. You do not get paid enough to deal with that ashattery. "
6,Just by the nickname (The Man) that manager sounds cool
7,"Great job, you saved the sale!"
8,"Sounds like she was just trying to get away with stealing. And very stupidly, too. "
9,"It sounds like she wanted 10 of them for $4.31.
She wanted 10 for $10 and then to save $5.69 off of that."
10,"&gt;W#1: Well that's crazy, I only wanted 1. What if someone prints 100 pages?!Me: Then they'd have to pay for 100 pages. (I mean what did she expect? We're not willing to take a loss for 15 pages, so she thought that we'd take a loss of 99?!)

Exactly, wtf is she thinking? Her hypothetical scenario doesn't even make sense. "
11,"&gt; And nothing of value was lost.

Only like, fifteen minutes of everyone's time. Except hers, of course."
12,"""Actually, I don't have a mother. I just appeared one day at a cash register and ta da! Still here now!"""
13,"&gt;If she ever did work retail there is a special place in hell waiting for her.

Traitors are the worst. What sort of place did you work at that makes you think behaving like this is okay? That didn't make you hate customers enough to never act like that yourself? She's probably lying or stretching the truth at the very least, but, if she's being honest, there's no excuse for that BS."
14,Im glad someone kicked her ass out of the break room for violating it's peace 
15,"He's awesome. Very knowledgeable, super chill, always has our back"
16,"This guy is brilliant!  Wow, I just figured out how to fund my life. 

1.  Buy

2.  Return

3.  Come back next day and demand the item for free

4.  Profit!"
17,"This reminds me of the story my dad has of when he worked in a grocery store and had customers constantly asking him if the milk was still good. He was like, obviously we wouldn't purposely sell you spoiled milk... He finally got fed up with one annoying customer, so when she asked again if the milk REALLY WAS good, he took it off the belt, opened it and took a big swig, and said, ""Tastes good to me, Ma'am!""

He got pulled aside by his manager later and the conversation went as follows:

Manager: Hey Pete, I got a... strange complaint today. Did... did you... did you drink a customer's milk?

Dad: ...Yes.

Manager: *sigh* Don't... don't do that again. "
18,"Here in England we have to pack our own bags 99% of the time, oh what savages we must seem."
19,She sounded like a raging virus.
20,"You should point out that you'll refund his debit card, and the ATM is right over there, where he can get his cash. "
21,"Well now I doubt the 84 year old grandfather part. Shouldve held her down and say ""Ma'am! You cannot leave until we find that poor old man! It may take us way past closing time, but we are here for you and your missing grandfather! Someone call 911 and the local news! We need to organize a search party!"""
22,He's an enabler. 
23,I'm glad u decided to go forward with that response
24,"Ah, to be rich."
25,"Yes money was refunded but there was no error on our part. We sell stone fountains that can vary in size, shape, and color. So while the stock photo shows the style they chose it doesn't show the EXACT fountain they chose. I just thought the lady was insane insisting she took the stock photo. "
26,"I love the ""what could the customer possibly have meant"" game after they're gone. End up playing it every day, but it keeps me sane! "
27,Yeah I like to insist that customers call corporate when their incompetence screws us at the store level. Like when they put an item on sale before we even have the inventory. 
28,"anytime a customer askes me to pick out a color for them I go straight to bubblegum pink. Oh you want me to get you a biege? Here you go. Blue? sure here's this pink. 

it gets them to shutup and pick their own color. Best part i have my manager backing me up too. Customer asked to talk to my manager about my behavior and my manager looked her dead in the eye and said ""Stop insulting my disabled employees, this young man is colorblind"" and I'm doing my best not to laugh. I'm not colorblind."
29,Maybe the soap was somehow used in the process of making the drugs. Weird situation.
30,"Excellent, it's now been upgraded from a 5-year to a *lifetime* warranty! "
31,"""I'd unplug my mother from life support to charge my phone, so if she was here she'd get no discount either.""

"
32,"Some lady tried this on me years ago. She reserved a set of living room chairs over the phone with my boss. Next day, she comes in right at open and tells me she's there to pick up them up. I tell her the price and she says, ""didn't I already pay on the phone?"" Nope. Spends 30 freaking minutes going from her car, to the chairs, and sitting digging in her purse for a receipt. A RECEIPT. For something she ""bought"" over the phone...
Obviously she didn't find it and had to pay up. Before this, she was trying to carry one out the door!"
33,"I had someone try that with a piece of luggage. She paid for her other items, and then tried to walk out with the bag until I said ""Oh, I'll need to the scan the luggage as well."" She gave me a deer in the headlights stare and mumbled that she didn't understand and didn't speak English when I had just had an entire conversation about the dimensions and height of the in English. Some people, man."
34,We Americans try to be lazy whenever possible
35,"To clarify, the reason they have a no checks over $1000 is to minimize the risk of a bad check.  Accepting two checks from the same person for the same transaction doesn't mitigate the risk.  This is why the business office would go nuts, you are evading the policy, not reducing the risk."
36,"Having bagged my own groceries, I can assure you that is false."
37,Sales don't bring out the worst *in* people. They just bring out the worst people in general.
38,"The reasoning is convoluted, but she's thinking the business will protect a customer from egregious mistakes.  If the mistake is bigger, it's more likely to be covered.

It's not as irrational as it seems: Many service businesses do work that way, and some people get trained to expect things to ""just work out"" without understanding why.  Then they get upset when their expectations are unmet."
39,And then what? Did she get a refund?
40,"I'm my experience a competent manager would have noticed OP had a difficult customer and have taken over or at least jumped in to help.

OP your manager threw you under the bus and they knew it  "
41,I know! Everyone who was there when it happened was just sorta blankly staring at her. I think we we're all just in mild disbelief and the fact that we couldn't react like people who didn't work there made it hard to say anything.
42,"Illilustrate the point for her. Don't give her the pretzels, and when she asks about it, say, ""Eat them from there.""  
""I can't""  
""You can't, or you just don't know how?""   
""I can't""  
Turn to the friend, ""She just doesn't know how.""  

Edit: punctuation"
43,"""Make sure to keep your receipt!"" Customer comes back without receipt. Retail in a nutshell."
44, He doesn't want to talk to you because you keep telling him the price he does not want to hear.
45,"Your *manager* could have handled it better.  Someone should have come and helped you, preferably on the phone, since you don't hear people on the phone very well.

As a manager, I would have taken the angry customer and had my employee work with the line that had formed."
46,"Exactly. If my SO did that, I would apologize profusely and make sure that I get her away from the cashier ASAP. It would actually be really embarrassing to be in that situation, making such a scene. 

He cares enough to make a slight effort to deescalate the situation, but doesn't care enough to actually do anything about it. 

Edit: speling "
47,"If I'm being honest... they didn't seem that wealthy. My guess is they'd saved up a long time for the shoes. And sure it's stupid and she'll grow out of them, but they had a lot of fun for a moment."
48,Offer to drink some of the milk to make it lighter
49,"At least those minutes were on the clock though, so no waste at all! "
50,"Oh my goodness! Your poor coworker! Was he okay? And why did management not block off that room and find employees somewhere else to store and eat lunches so that they didn't have to be around human waste? I understand it may have been tough to get a plumber out as soon as possible, but they created a very hazardous unsanitary situation, and no one should have had to go into a break room with a buckets full of human waste and a ceiling ready to drop it on him. "
51,Lmao
52,"When you're paid by the hour, there's no such thing as wasting time."
53,"Yeah, I roll my eyes a lot of times at excess, but I can't really fault this couple if OP's impression was that they were having a blast. Who knows what their own childhoods were like? Or how long they prayed for this child? And, TBH, if someone gets that much joy out of a $300 one-off splurge, it seems a fair trade. 

Thank for the smile today!"
54,I think it was rage inspired stupidity
55,"And if you had given I bet she would have wanted the other 15 ""since you're just going to throw them out"""
56,Brains vs Brawn
57,"*Daddy, I want an oompah-loompah NOWWWWW!!!!*"
58,"Ugh I had a coworker who tried to return worn shoes to our store. Our policy is that we don't take refunds on shoes that have been worn outside. When she comes in just to shop, she also makes a mess, asks the cashier to double check the price on all her items (even though it says on the box), and takes forever at the cash desk pondering which shoes she wants and which shoes she doesn't want. 

You were supposed to be one of us!"
59,"""Right, well how about you come back when you actually know what you're looking for."""
60,"""Would you like your receipt, mister?""

Ftfy"
61,"&gt; ""I shouldn't have to READ the sign.""

Lady you ALREADY read the sign.  You just didn't read the whole sign."
