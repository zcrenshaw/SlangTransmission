0,Do yourself a favor and dont tell anyone at work about this.  Thats how hard working people get fired.
1,"I did not expect that. Very cool customer. Kudos to you, Suitman, wherever you may be!"
2,"I actually did tell one of my managers, just because it was probably on tape what I did and I needed to be honest. He said I wasn't supposed to do it but he'll just keep it between the two of us and not get me in trouble."
3,"Nope, some days I eat the customers. But only the rude ones."
4,"Yay, Tim."
5,"I mean, you could have at least poured her a Pepsi"
6,[deleted]
7,That's amazing. I wish I could say stuff like that to people but we're strictly forbidden from out right accusing even if we know they're in the wrong. I would have paid to see that in action though!
8,"&gt;All of a sudden I hear a gasp and when I look up towards the register (it's a good 5 feet away and not facing in the same direction as my front door) a customer glares at me and says ""Do you always eat in front of your customers?""  
  
*spits donut out onto shirt and floor*
No, Sir. I have more class than that. "
9,"Nice, manager covering for you! I wish more managers did that."
10,He's got dirt on you now. Hope you don't mind digging holes in the woods.
11,"Probably read about the ""life hack"" where you check out at customer service because there's never a line."
12,"MA'AM, I ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT I AM NOT A COFFEE  PERSON, YOU'RE REFUSING TO HELP ME SO I'M GOING TO...."
13,Also don't forget that when they pay by credit card in store it also gets submitted via the internet.
14,"He's the hero we need, but not the one we deserve. "
15,"""You were the recording?!""

Oh, so you *did* hear something then. You just chose to ignore it.

I love people when they decide that rules apply to everyone else but them. It's so much fun to inform them that's not the case. Thankfully your customer didn't get too mad for their own mistake!"
16,"Have never had a manager like him before. Most managers look down on staff and sees them as replaceable. He actively reminds us that we're decent salespeople and that he hired us because we can do things he can't. He's a super nice chap and he also does a lot of charity work in his spare time. 

He also let's us throw the F-bomb and C-word around in the office if we have particularly horrific customers. Best employer ever."
17,"PLEASE PLACE ITEM IN THE BAGGING AREA

**UNEXPECTED ITEM IN THE BAGGING AREA**"
18,"Because (in america at least) some people will seriously assault and or possibly kill you for even small value items, and its impossible to tell who might go off on you for even accusing them of shoplifting.  Right or not."
19,My dream is to get really rich and buy the stores these people shop at just so I can tell them where to shove their rudeness and ban them from ever coming back
20,I think this story beautifully sums up retail livin'.  
21,"I know, so inconsiderate"
22,That's some pretty advanced stupid right there 
23,How dare you have a life outside of work /s
24,"At my gf's work, you basically observe and report. Watch them closely while they are in the store, then call the cops/insurance company after they leave. It's a safety issue. "
25,"That is ridiculous. You have no way of knowing what sicknesses or diseases a customer might have. You definitely had every right to refuse and if your manager pushed the issue, you definitely could have filed a complaint with your local labor board."
26,You should've gasped back and asked her if she's always this stupid in public 
27,"Why?

Because the hiring process alone takes about a week so"
28,"And while she was doing this, her partner was loading up on high value items elsewhere in the store. Being attractive is great if you are the decoy."
29,"What is a CSM for those of us not in retail?

I come here to laugh at horrible people."
30,"A duck enters a bar, waddles over to the bartender and asks,  ""Hey, got any grapes?""

The bartender replies, ""No. This is a bar. We have beer.""

""Oh,"" says the duck. It turns around and waddles out. 

The next day, the duck returns.  ""Hey, got any grapes?""

""I told you yesterday, stupid duck. I don't have GRAPES. This is a BAR. I serve BEER. Get out. If you come back looking for grapes I'll nail your ass to the wall.""

""Ok."" The duck turns and waddles out.

A few days later the duck returns. He waddles over to the bar. 

""Hey, got any nails?""

""What the hell is wrong with you?! Did this look like a goddamn hardware store?!""

""Oh, "" replies the duck. ""Got any grapes?"""
31,"r/RandomActsOfKindness ;)

Great story though. Very heart warming. 

"
32,"B-But her son couldn't have possibly forgotten the threads! He is just so darn aware and smart and just oh my GOD how could you even THINK that's what happened?!?!?!?!?!? /s

What a pain in the butt. It's funny how people think everything is automatically a store's fault. It's raining? Must be [store name]'s fault. The country is $XXXXXXXXXXXXX in debt? Must be [store name]'s fault. I forgot my pin number!!! [Store name]'s fault!!"
33,"People like this, being offended at things like eating at work, are fucking weirdos."
34,"Is it possible that he stole the phone, but couldn't use it because of the password?"
35,"If you're not allowed to accuse them, what are you supposed to do when you see them shoplifting?"
36,"Ahahaha there is almost always a line. Money transfers, returns and usually the only override keys are in the hands of one person."
37,Just noticed my title typo. The horror D:
38,"The two sentences I wish I could have said over the course of my life in retail:

""No, I don't trust you.""

""Yes, I am calling you a liar."""
39,Oh boy do I have some news for her about people who work fast food. *theyre not real chefs!* shocking. I know. 
40,[removed]
41,"You also have to consider with furniture that you can't just grab something buried behind other items.  They're put in the truck in a specific order based upon their delivery route.  This lady probably assumes it's like a UPS truck where there's a little walkway with boxes on both sides, or something like that."
42,After we started dating and I met my boyfriend's family I found out that his Aunt and Uncle adopted my little sister.
43,Hahahahahahahaha! Good for both of you. You both annoyed him far more by just being polite. Which is the mark of a great retail ~~slave~~ worker.
44,"So while you were still filling his gas they started the engine and moved the car risking 

Damage to the pump.

A gas leak

Fire

and probably a lot of other things and you were worried about getting fired? I would be more worried about getting set on fire."
45,Coming in on weekends is obviously worse.
46,"I'm surprised the customer didn't hit her with the ever popular ""but I bought it here before!"" 
"
47,Or shove the whole donut in your mouth while making moaning noises. 
48,What the hell did she do? Buy enough stuff to re-model a room and then decided she wanted to go with a different colour scheme?

51,"She probably decorated a house to sell and once it was sold, returned the items. Not that uncommon actually. "
52,"This had crossed my mind but he was an older man and I can't really see 60/70 year old wanting to steal a smartphone. Most likely he set the password himself, forgot what he set it to and came into my shop looking for someone to blame."
53,"Same. Though I generally tend to skip the brains, they're usually shriveled and nasty."
54,Shh. Don't tell anyone
55,"&gt;you can see where I'm coming from right?""

Yeah, I can see you're an irrational piece of crap who doesn't listen and doesn't think i'm a human being. 

edit: but as soon as I've gotten my way, I can be ""magnanimous"" in ""victory"".
"
56,"Umm excuse me, basic physiological responses are not allowed. Come on, everyone knows we're robots programed to serve. Next thing I know you'll be telling me you blink and have considered breathing on the job. "
57,"I can't decide which is better, the manager being sensible and banning her, or the twist ending where you *could* have helped her all along if she stopped insisting you were useless for half a minute.

Either way, mmmm schadenfreude. "
58,Just start talking while food is falling out of your mouth
59,"In a waitress, and had a table come in right before closing. They get drinks and say they want to ""enjoy them for a while"" before ordering, and will probably have two rounds before they're ready to eat. Ugh, fine. What really pissed me off was when I dropped off their menus for them to look over, they said, ""Oh, the poor girl probably wants to go home,""  and laughed. YES, I DO WANT TO GO HOME, AND IT'S NOT FUNNY TO ME. "
60,"&gt;I was working alone on a Wednesday morning, which is a fairly *dead* time in the department

Nice foreshadowing...

&gt;""Who's the lucky guy this is for?""... She responds by saying ""My father. He passed away yesterday."" 

""So, you won't be needing a receipt for any exchanges then, right?""

^^^^^Yeah, ^^^^^I ^^^^^know, ^^^^^evil...but ^^^^^humorous.
"
61,"&gt; I hand the customer her bags, and she starts to walk away. My retail training kicks in for some reason, and I say ""Have a nice day.""  
  
[](/flutterfear-in """")I had a vet tech say the same thing as she was handing the me the receipt from euthanizing my cat of seventeen years. She was mortified the moment she said it, and her apology was as profuse as it was awkward.  

I knew that it was just an automatic response and didn't hold it against her. Why would I? I'd hope the lady felt the same way if she heard you. "
62,"Fish and chips, obviously "
63,Wow! Thanks for banning them from your store instead of trying to make a easy buck! Our streets are def. safer without people like that carrying guns
64,This is beautiful. But the burning question at the back of my mind is what did you do with the weed?
65,"&gt; What are you going to do about it?'

Well, I could always shove it up your arse..."
