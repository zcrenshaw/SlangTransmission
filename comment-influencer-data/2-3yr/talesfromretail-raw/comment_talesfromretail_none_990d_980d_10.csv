0,"&gt;“Ma’am, you ‘returned’ it like you left it in a field and called us 2 weeks later to say it’s in a field somewhere.

That made me laugh so hard. Excellent."
1,You are a good manager. I hope she gets banned from the store.
2,It sounds like he may have been OCD. Changes in routine or certain numbers can sometimes be upsetting.
3,"He asked me if our security cameras had audio, because THAT'S what he really wanted for his wife for Christmas."
4,"""Yes ma'am. I dropped your refund in a mailbox, in cash, without an envelope or any postage. Did you get it yet?"""
5,"Maybe they confused ram with storage
Edit: Next time send him [here](http://www.downloadmoreram.com/download.html) "
6,Good Job the Husband was rational.
7,The moment he said 128gb my mind instantly went to storage.
8,"I'm sure he'll take both, but he really came for the third option: Very Loose Garden Women. "
9,"That is just ridiculous. I don't know how things work at a dealership, but in my job if someone does something for me I thank them for it. ""Oh you found that key? Cool thanks man!"" ""Oh sweet thanks for getting all that info from the wife"" 
Why ya gotta be a bitch man "
10,"Amazing plot twist:""Do your security cameras have audio?""""We don't even have security cameras!""Dad and two kids pull out their guns."
11,I did actually say that. Encounters  like this was why I found leaving customer service so difficult - I had no regular outlet for passively agressively letting people know how stupid they were being.
12,"Once when I worked in retail we had a Secret Santa come in and asked the manager if he could go around and find customers with kids whose presents he could pay for. Oddly enough we didn't have a lot of customers in the store at the time, and the ones who were shopping politely declined, as they could afford it and felt someone else would need the gift more. After he came up and told this to my manager, the manager asked if she could nominate an employee for the Secret Santa gift. He said that would be fine, so she nominated one of my coworkers who was a single mother with two little girls and she got to take a break and go shopping around the store. It was really incredible, she was in tears and got to get her girls their first bikes and a couple of other toys they'd wanted but she couldn't otherwise afford. 

Whenever I'm having a horrible retail Christmas I always remember that story and get a little misty-eyed. There are still some very, very good people in this world."
13,"There's a customer I keep encountering who has a problem with this stuff too...she'll grab a face cream or whatever off the shelf, open it before we notice, swipe her finger through to try it, and then usually she buys it...but she'll come over and hand you the open one and be like ""this one is *open*, I wanted to test it but I don't want an open one"". And she'll make you prove that the one she buys is fully sealed before she'll put it in her cart.

So she's the perfect example of this. 100% fine with opening one for her OWN testing, of course that's okay! But she doesn't want to BUY one that's open, even if she's the one who opened it!"
14,Who cares what a customer thinks when your health is at stake? Blood and no gloves are a no go. 
15,"Definitely - autism as well. As an example, knew someone who's son would be very upset if there was an change in the way they drove to certain places (i.e. If an detour was made or they made an unexpected stop), "
16,"I'm 40 ~ I've been given the senior discount (without question) ... At first I was insulted ... and then I realized the discount was pretty big. So, ok!"
17,"You know how in lots of Tales, there's the family member who stands there and gives the retail worker a very apologetic look while the customer they are unfortunately related to throws a fit?

This guy is a step up. He has become an expert at shutting down his wife's public antics.

A hero to us all."
18,"One time I had a customer buying ingredients for a dessert she was making, I commented how good said dessert is. A few hours later she came back and handed me some in a plastic container. 

It was a nice surprise but also so sweet of her to go out of her way to bring me some. "
19,I wonder how some people function in their lives. 
20,"This is also one of my favorite parts of customer service. Here's a recent encounter with an obviously underage person trying to buy alcohol with no ID:

Bitchy Lady: ""This isn't good customer service""

Me: ""I provide service, the good customer part is your responsibility""

Bitchy Lady: ""If you hate your job so much, you shouldn't take it out on the customers.""

Me: ""I love my job, and my customers are always happy to see me, but you are right about me hating something right now."""
21,Fantastic. I should have said that. 
22,I made the mistake of going to the thrift store on a Wednesday.   The line to checkout was old people all of the way to the other end of the store.  It looked like the queue to heaven. 
23,From my retail experience it is! It's a wonderful place where you can go and hide for a minute or two while you pretend to look for an item that you know you don't have in stock.
24,"&gt;She let out a frustrated shriek at the moon

At this point I stopped picturing a customer in her pajama pants and started picturing a werewolf in pajama pants.

I got a good laugh out of that, thank you."
25,Blood is nothing to mess around with. I would take someone screaming at me before possibly exposing myself to blood-borne diseases
26,"Most retail customers think ""in the back"" is a magical place."
27,You are a great manager! Most managers would have bent over backwards for that lady. Glad you stood up for your employee. 
28,"She got caught out. She was supposed to have started the work on the car, or at least have it looked at on the Monday after it was towed in. She didn't do anything about it for a week and was trying to cover her ass. Unfortunately she was using really torn fishing net to cover it. "
29,"Unfortunately in the dealership I worked in, I did know a lot of information and I did a lot of work that others didn't want to do. I thought outside the square, did my job very well, but because others didn't like that, I copped the brunt of their bitchiness. I constantly had to explain myself to the boss, and I always proved the others wrong (not on purpose). I was just doing my job, and they didn't like me doing it so well I suppose! "
30,"Hell yes, I was thinking the same thing! Nothing worse than a manager overriding or contradicting staff when they have been abused, especially for just doing what they are supposed to."
31,"I'm SO glad you were there to see it, explain to the gentleman what was going on, and help a lady get a phone back for Christmas.

ROCK on!!"
32,By being a burden on everyone around them.
33,"""Oh this candle right here ma'am? You would like to purchase this?

*throws candle against wall*

""Purchase that."""
34,[Nope](http://i.imgur.com/ximEDxf.gifv)
35,"Sounds like all my console friends' knowledge of computers. When they're trying to buy a computer they look at the RAM, and that's it."
36,All this over a CANDLE...some people man. 
37,My store had the same. He will pay at least 75k off in layaways for people. A few years ago he did 300k. He refused to let anyone know who it was or anything. It was always great for people to hear their layaway was paid for. 
38,[removed]
39,"WOWEE, was there reason to lie? Commission? Good looking numbers? It's crazy to me that someone would even try lying about that and have the audacity to call you out on doing your job."
40,"we had something similar at a #fastfoodjoint I worked at. The song had no purpose, just played at the same time every single day through the work radio. The song frequently said ""Cha"". So, like clockwork, we'd all say 'Cha Cha Cha' every time it did it. Well, without thinking about it, we of course follow our little ritual. 9 people in the back, 8 cashiers, two people working drive through, the supervisor AND the manager (who has tried many times to get us to stop doing this very thing). The customers in the store must have thought we were all crazy."
41,"I'm a clinically depressed man, and while you raise valid possibilities, you're coming across as excusing the woman's behavior. A retail associate is not tasked with coddling every member of the public they encounter for consideration of their fragile emotional state."
42,"""I get hookups from the manager"" does not exactly translate to ""I own this place"""
43,"That was my favorite part too! My fondest new years wish is that OP actually said that to her!  Please, OP?  For me?"
44,"&gt;W: No, it was a gift for my husband, I got rid of the receipt so he wouldn't know how much I spent.  

&gt; W: When I bought this shirt it was £12.50!  

lolwut? Got rid of the receipt because of £12.50? Who cares if he knows that you spent that much on a shirt?"
45,"Well do they?
"
46,"*Her: ""Yes but I didn't know they would be sweet.""*

Pro tip: if ever you order water, be forewarned that it is *wet.*"
47,"I have an ebay shop and sell all kinds of odds and ends. A customer bought several lots of yarn and during our convos about combined shipping she mentioned she wanted the yarn b/c she was stuck in bed after an injury in a car accident and she was bored.

I keep a pile of cheap greeting cards from the thrift store for shipping small flat things in, so I dug out a 'get well' card and put it in her box. It was a cheap and easy thing to do--no big deal at all. Well, she was so touched by this, she sent me a scarf she knitted herself a few weeks later."
48,"she spent the five, she just was trying to save face."
49,When you tear holes in a net it makes fewer holes.
50,"It says a lot that yesterday's storage is today's ram, and tomorrow's is likewise  going to be massive compared to today."
51,"why would a shop be public property? Its private property, and its not the customer who decides what is allowed and what isn't."
52,"That's so bizarre lol, most people like discount."
53,"Have your manager call her, because he has additional questions when she shows up. Then pull her I to the camera room, and show her the footage of what happened. I want to see her face. And then have your manager tell her she is banned for lying, with her photo."
54,"I've seen a few bad ones where I work from elderly customers.  The worst one recently, happened when an 80 + year old lady dropped a box of protein drinks on her own leg.  Hit her in the shin and caused massive damage to her leg.  She was on blood thinners and lost at least a pint of blood.  Had to call an ambulance to transport her.  She ended up needing skin grafts to repair her leg.  Had to use our BBP protocol to clean it all up.  

Of course she's now suing us for her medical bills since its our fault she dropped something on her own leg.  I've looked at the security footage myself and there was nothing unsafe about the display, she's just clumsy. "
55,Was the customer an ancient sea creature living in Scotland?
56,We also call that Florida
57,Oh yes that was a most definite. I'm not there anymore. 
58,"""But .. but when l practiced this conversation  in my head on the way over here, you said everything was fine!"""
59,"&gt;""Yes but I didn't know they would be sweet""

And yet thousands of other people did before you."
60,Am 30ish. Would kill for old guy discount. I even own slippers!
61,That guy is Awesome!  I wish I had the money to do things like that for people.
