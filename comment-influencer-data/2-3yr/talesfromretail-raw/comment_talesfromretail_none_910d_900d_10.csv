0,"&gt;Wow, ok. You're gonna make a great dad some day.

Says the man asking a *stranger* to help him change his baby. "
1,"&gt;My wife normally does all the changing!

Dad of the year right there. "
2,"Let me guess, your store keeps those 1700 pairs in the magical back, along with thousands of each of the items the store carries. "
3,"Here you go, did some copy pasta:

""Don't ever buy stupid Rupp off and had to call cops they did nothing said about trade laws and did nothing.""
-AD"
4,"&gt;Customer: Wow, so you're fine telling a little girl no?

bad parent spotted"
5,"As an Australian, sales tax threw me when I visited the US. Sure, I got used to it eventually, but our system in which it's already listed in the price is just wonderful."
6,"Don't feel bad, fuck that skep ass old bitch for trying to get you to lose your job so she could sue. "
7,A very *cheep* one ;)
8,"You mean to tell me ""Have a nice day"" isn't Australian for ""F**k you, b***h""?"
9,"I had a dude give me $10 for some groceries then accuse me of stealing.  
  
""I gave you $100 bill! Where's my change?!""  
  
""No you didn't, I don't even have a $100 in my till. But I'll be more than happy to have a manager come up here and count my register for me and check it against what the computer says I should.""  
  
""Do that. (under breath) I can't believe this.""  
  
""Okay, well I counted it twice and my manager counted it twice and it turns out I'm actually 74 cents short. Like I said, I didn't have a $100 in my register. Maybe you misplaced it somewhere else.""  
  
Don't fuckin accuse me of stealing from you."
10,You know I usually don't mind when their on their phones as you don't have to interact as much. However I hate when they cannot look up or at least pay half attention to the payment of it all. Like you ain't gotta look at me lady but at least look while I take your money.
11,"As an American, I wish we had that system, but understand why we don't."
12,if you can I would love to read that review.
13,"&gt;Supervisor: Broken? Uhh. Have you tried putting it through the washing machine?

It's a pity the customer didn't listen to this advice.  Sometimes towels can have some sort of sizing in them (I think it's to make them seem extra thick &amp; plush) that makes the towel surface hydrophobiic until they are run through the wash.  

"

15,"&gt;ARE YOU FUCKING CALLING ME A THIEF?

No, but your son is, Beefcake."
16,"If this happens again just say ""Nah, it'll violate my parole"" and bam, suddenly they don't want you near their child. I do it all the time and nobody asks me to wipe their child anymore."
17,"He starts out by admitting his wife usually does all the changing, then asks a total stranger to help change a naked baby.  Then ends it with a sarcastic ""I bet you'll be a great dad someday."", as if he's saying he's a great dad and you suck as a human being. 

Does he not see the irony???  "
18,"""Bless her heart."" Is southern American for ""well isn't she a moron."""
19,I'm glad I'm not the only one who wondered why this lady thought any store would even have that many pairs of pants to sell at once.
20,"My coworker just left our work. He was the only one there for three hours - surrounding counties are passing travel bans. And he got two or three ""you're closing?!"" phone calls.

I hate selfish customers.

Greene/Albany County, NY here. Where's your snowpocalypse happening?"
21,"I work at a pet store and someone bought a bird yesterday. My boss told her that the bird she was buying was 19.99. I put the price through the register and it was 21 and some change, she had a 20 sitting on  the table. When I told her she goes 21?!?!?! I was like yeah sales tax...."
22,"""I'm fine telling a little girl her dad is a horrible planner and didn't get her here on time"" "
23,Too angry to even use punctuations.
24,"Gah! Just noticed the mistake I  made with the $ sign in the post title. 
Shouldn't post before coffee. "
25,"Such incredible amounts of nope.

On a side note, why would your company allow only one employee in a store?  *Especially* a cash for gold store.  I work at a pet food store and management requires us to have two people in the store at a time (for safety)."
26,[removed]
27,"I can't count how many times people have shown up long after closing, only to be completely baffled by the doors being locked. "
28,"What kind of mom doesn't know what instrument her kid plays, especially when she's the one picking her up and dropping her off at lessons for said instrument?"
29,"If she actually called corporate, they'd likely laugh her off the line.

1700 pairs? That's a seasonal re-stock from a distributor, not a 5-minutes after closing retail sale."
30,She's sounds like she wanted to fall over. Did anything ever come of it?
31,A store that caters to pregnant women with a structured fee schedule is actually expecting their customers to pay it!? How bizarre...
32,I am damn sure there is no chance but fuck i get chills just rethinking about that inccident. Thank god it wasn't worse than bruises.
33,"I work at a small, family-owned company that's been open less than a year. We do what are called Escape Rooms, where you lock yourself in a room and have one hour to figure out all the clues to escape. Because of the way it works (rooms have to be set up, props arranged right, cameras turned on, remote electronics rigged, lights set, locks locked, and everything watched and timed from the Game Master room) we require that customers book either online or over the phone at least 45 minutes before they come in. 


That's right. 30 minutes of setup, and we only require customers to book 45 minutes in advance. 

Anyway, one day while I'm cleaning up the last room, we get a dad who just walks into the building, takes his kid to a room, and shuts the door. I walk in thinking, ""what is this guy doing?"" I figure he's just confused, so I greet him. I will be Me. Idiot will be Idiot.

Me: Hello, can I help you?

Idiot: -while messing with props- Nah, I'm just here to do this room with my kid. 

Me: Oh, you must be our 3:00 booking! You're 15 minutes early. Let me just check you in and take your payment and we'll get started. 

Idiot: Nah, I'll pay after. 

Me: I'm sorry Sir, but for a long list of reasons, we don't do that here. It'll just take a minute to get your payment and then we can start your booking. 

Idiot: I didn't make a booking. 

Me: I'm sorry?

Idiot: My wife's at the spa and I'm bored, so I want to do this room now. How much time do I have left?

Me: Sir, I haven't even started your time. I'm afraid you can't do this room if you don't have a booking. We have another group scheduled to do it in 15 minutes. 

Idiot: Well we're already here! 

Me: Well, I can book you for the room next door for right now, but I have to ask you to put [very specifically-arranged prop down] so I can reset the room for the group who will now be here in ten minutes. 

Idiot: My kid wants to do this room! It's her favorite game! 

-The Price is Right?? Your five-year-old's favorite game is The Price is Right. Okay. Also, kid is just playing on Idiot's cell phone at this point-

Me: I'm sorry, but you cannot do this room.

Idiot: So you're just gonna tell the kid no?!

Me: ... Yes. "
34,Sometimes taxes are set by the county or even town and can vary very easily. It would be hard for a corporate entity to keep up with all these individual prices and changes.
35,"And if you don't pay attention, you have no right to complain when it wasn't done exactly the way you would have wanted. "
36,Sounds like Bonnie and Clyde had a really bad case of the munchies.
37,"A freaking plus to the person who called her out in line. Too many selfish people in the world, not enough people to stand up to them."
38,"We are a pretty high volume store so we probably did have them spanning multiple departments. Would we of sold her that many at that time of day? Hell nah, come back tomorrow lady.   

Edit - I thought the Reddit grammar police thing was just a meme, but I guess not. "
39,"That would have resulted in a complaint to district management about the store manager. There is no need to yell at an employee, much worse, on the sales floor, in front of fellow employees, and customers. "
40,"He backed me up for sure. He said something along the lines of ""Well I'm pretty sure that would violate at least one of our company's policies, so unfortunately there isn't much he could've done for you."""
41,"Yeah I had a lady say she gave me a $20 when she really gave me a $10. Made a big deal out of it and made my manager count it out in front of her. Surprise she did give me a $10. Wasted a bunch of her own, the managers, and my time in the process. "
42,"You should have seriously told her that you finished stocking each and every one of those soaps about 15 minutes earlier. Also that that money has been touched by millions of people doing god knows what. 

Just to watch her mind explode. "
43,She didn't want to have to keep carrying it around... so it was made of granite?
44,"Like I said, I understand why. It doesn't mean I don't wish it was different."
45,"Most people won't believe you if you tell them the stove is hot.... They must touch it and get hurt before they will believe you.

The general population is just that dumb. "
46,"At the end, I wish you had said to him, ""Can I sue you?"" ;)

Great story!"
47,"&gt; What if I just call security and tell them I have a theft and someone trying to sneak into an exhibit?

This is so great. I *love* telling people that there are serious ramifications for their absurdity. "
48,"&gt; seek professional help

and not just for home repairs"
49,He'll make a great dad *some day*
50,"""Millions of people believe in God without a shred of proof but if they see a sign that says 'wet paint', they have to touch it to be sure."""
51,"This. A lot of towels I have had were not absorbent until I had washed them a few times. I even had some dish clothes that took half a dozen washes before they absorbed...

Edit: yes, I meant cloths. Thanks for pointing that out lol. Also, I never use fabric softener on towels. That messes with the absorbency as well. "
52,"What sorta bird is 20 bucks.
"
53,"&gt; ARE YOU FUCKING CALLING ME A THIEF?

Do you have sweets in your pockets too?"
54,"Probably stolen games, the freak out is to try and scare you into pushing the transaction through in fear of getting in trouble. People use this tactic at my store a lot, usually when someone clearly has a stolen credit card and tries to buy a ton of gift cards.

Edit: Also your tag made me laugh, people asked me that sort of thing so much during Christmas a few months ago.

""No, they didn't make Pokémon for Xbox One."""
55,"My system is set up the same way.  If the customer swipes I need the last 4 digits of their card.  I've had people give me their PIN codes instead.  I tend to admonish them and remind them to never give that code to anyone, if they're asking for it or not."
56,This seems like it might lead to bigger problems.
57,"Oh my god, I hate this lady. How dare you betray your fellow retail drone? At least regular customers don't know any better, but this...

(Also, lol, hear you on the weird survey math. Ours is slightly more forgiving in that we fear the dread 8/10 as a 0%, but it is still just so absurd.)"
58,"Security? In a British supermarket? You must be joking!

Sure there might be a security person but their job is to stop the obvious people and call the police and be a good witness, not to confront idiots like this. 

And good luck getting the police to turn out, they'll be busy running from stabbing to domestic all shift so won't have time to deal with a shoplifting. Best plan is to get a crime number over the phone and let the insurance sort it out."
59,"I guess he thought we were pulling the old ""we-only-sell-mulch"" excuse. "
60,"Seriously? It sounds like there was a serious lack of training there, for both the associates and the managers. And that is definitely the wrong reaction to the situation. 

Also, it is likely that the company tracks both total transaction voids and line voids where just a single item is canceled. 

Mine does, and any time we have to do the transaction void a slip prints which must be signed by the associate and the person that overrode the void along with the reason for needing it. 

Sorry for your sucky experience!"
61,Read this as Methhead doesn't understand meth 
62,The bad kind of moms
63,This girl said she gave me a 20 and i gave change as if she gave a10. I was in the middle of arguing when i open my drawer and see a 20 in the 10 spot.  I was thoroughly embarrassed
64,"As a fat lady, I thought this was going to be the funniest euphamism ever."
65,The burning  question here did the manager back you up or throw you under the bus? lol
66,Or correct spelling.
67,"Never heard of her after then. She probably was trying to get money, or just was an idiot. "
68,"&gt; there is cam footage

There you go, no worries. None of that dumb ""her word against mine"" hassle. You're understandably rattled. If you stay rattled, you could sue her for PTSD treatment. hehe"
69,"""...and it's unbelievable how you say 'doesn't really matter'. yet it does."""
70,"&gt; You're not going to sell it all otherwise

You are literally here, now, trying to buy it. Your presence has disproven your own point."
71,Haha I thought it was intentional 😂
72,"thought this was serendipitous and wanted to share with you my front page.

73,"""If you've been writing us checks for 18 years, you should understand the process by now.  I need the following information, please."""
74,"The moment he said ""not my problem"" is the moment I would have shut the register and said ""we're closed"" and watched the customer bitch just so I could reply ""not my problem"". Regardless of it being because of the law, your hours of operation are your hours of operation. It's not up to the customer to decide when you close. "
75,"She wasn't just looking to save money, of course, because if that's all she wanted, she could've easily just bought the caulk without telling anyone anything and be done with it. She wanted validation and someone to sue if something went wrong. Worst kind of customer."
76,"&gt; Customer: Wow, so you're fine telling a little girl no?

""Maybe if your parents told you no once in a while you wouldn't have ended up like... you.""

I probably wouldn't have thought of it in the moment, but I'm sure my shower head would have REALLY be told later that night."
77,"""Do not ever buy anything from this establishment. It is a stupid rip off. In addition, I had to call the police, but they could do nothing for me. They cited trade laws and did nothing"" - Angry Dad"
78,"If it wasn't a distraction, it might have been them just underestimating the self-checkout, and it being their first attempt. Really curious why she approached you before trying it though, seems like the number one way to get caught, talking to an employee unnecessarily.

Also out of curiosity, do self-checkouts know the weights of grocery items? Like if they had put the cupcakes down at the same time as the 2-liter would the computer have noticed?"
