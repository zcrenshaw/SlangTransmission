0,Why do they expect you to be able to take something back after 5 years?
1,"my years in retail taught me that a lot of people are walking around looking like rational adults, but in fact are barely functional.  Some people actually assume stores are selling products at 100% profit...like the items just magically appear ""in the back"" and get sold.

The idea that everything sold is actually bought first, and then marked up a surprisingly small amount is completely foreign to them.   ""$50 is better than $0, right""...""uh no, selling at a loss is not only bad business, but wipes out the profit on other sales as well"""
2,"Because people like these are just special wittle snowflakes, who think the world and the way it works should be how they want it to work. 

And they want it to work that way *right this instant*!"
3,"Thanks for reading everyone, I hope you enjoyed my story. 

It's funny, even if the sign did just say 50%, Husband really could have gotten it from anywhere. I almost brought that up, but I didn't want to kick them while they were down."
4,I absolutely hate it when customers grab signs. It completely destroys all context if there is question about price. I'm good about giving the customers the benefit of the doubt but grabbing signs sets me off.
5,"I'm honestly surprised by the number of people who think her kids were actually going to go hungry.

This was very likely attempted check fraud, which is the whole reason the 10 day policy exists. If you buy something with a check, then return the items before the check clears, you can stop payment or just let it bounce having received the cash essentially for free.

She was just using the common ""think of the children"" tactic of gaining sympathy to get what she wants.

OP's manager is a rock star though."
6,"Good job, OP. You sound like such a kind, understanding person. We seriously need more people like you in the world &lt;3"
7,"Possibly recently married (or divorced) and had a last name change.  Legally they can sign however they want (as I recall, in the US at least).  Witness protection is a possible other guess, but much less likely."
8,"At least she was understanding, and didn't start yelling at you. Which still would have been better than dying. "
9,"Why not tell her to wait her turn, at the back of the line. Or at least after the people you called up."
10,"Once the father told you that he had it, you are in the clear; these old ladies over reacted."
11,"&gt;""I'M A MARINE!""

""And I'm ashamed that someone like *you* is representing me overseas.  Get out."""
12,You need to get that CCTV tape sent straight to the local military base - well handled on your part but his behaviour is totally unacceptable
13,I like your final bit there...
14,"&gt; Thanks for reading everyone

Well someone has to if your customers won't."
15,"Are you are woman or why don't you know what he was talking about? They are ususally kept downstairs, huge black boxe... You know what, I'll just let someone else take care of the explaining, I'm not paid enough to deal with customers who don't even know what soakaways are... ^(Or in other words: No idea.)"
16,"He might be used to another store at has BBQ sauce on aisle 15, but after having been down aisle 15 and seeing cleaning supplies he should have realized that's not the right aisle."
17,"I've had customers like this. I had a man the other day cut in front of a heavily pregnant woman, snapping at her that ""I was here first"". I looked at the clock and turned to my manager.

""Time for my break, Boss."" And I smiled at the guy. ""Sorry, I'm on lunch now.""

This wasn't like a split second choice. My manager was leaving right after I got back, so I had to take it. It was just beautifully timed."
18,I wish I had the backbone to call people out but I'm a huge pushover at work.

20,"(The next day...)
Lady: ""Hey, you got your job back!""
You: ""Yeah, turns out Management would rather have a tolerant employee over a stupid customer that can't read.""

Edit ""than can't"" --&gt; ""that can't"" (note to self: type better on mobile)"
21,"LPT:  coupons (when you don't actually *have* coupons) go to the customers who deserve coupons, not the ones who ask if we have any, act annoyed, complain, etc. 


This is our unwritten policy if we happen to have a spare coupon where I work that another customer didn't use or if someone has just been really nice. A good tip to remember for customers and employees alike. More flies with honey and all that...
"
22,"When that person buys a new car, do they expect the dealer to refund them the full purchase price of the old one, plus all the money they spent on maintenance and repairs?"
23,Your manager has no backbone.
24,She doesn't get that answering her question would be you working off the clock.
25,"&gt; She ended up buying a new laptop, but obviously wasn't refunded a single coin for her old one.

Good. She sounds crazy."
26,"I'm less inclined to think it was a last name change due to a marriage or divorce just because it was a man and men are less likely to change their name in the United States. But, it could be. Some men probably do it.

Witness protection is a lot cooler of an explanation."
27,Ha. A well deserved guilt trip.
28,"He's not wrong, it's the grocery store's fault for not being just like his other store."
29,"Besides that, even cheap flip phones have cameras these days. Just take a picture of the damn thing! Why take it off the wall and tote it around with you?"
30,"&gt; I will never understand why people think return policies don't apply to them. 

Because I'm speeeeeeeeeeeeeciiaaaaalllll! /s"
31,"""I'd be happy to do that for you, sir.  The price of this new Honda Accord is $78,000."""
32,"hot diggity that's a great coupon....

edit: ~40%"
33,Daaaamn that was brutal. In a good way.
34,"&gt;My internal monologue: Here we fucking go

LMAO this was me DAILY, HOURLY, at my last retail job"
35,"Thank you so much for what you did for her! Sometimes there is no right thing to say, but making an effort to understand and help is so much better."
36,I know what you mean. And sometimes you just have to choose your battles.
37,"Exactly. It was the first thing I said, even the dad told the ladies he didn't need one but it annoyed me that they continued to have a go at me."
38,"I would presume op was just referring to the fact she is likely to have a harder time standing in line, and maybe therefore cutting in line of a pregnant woman is worse than cutting in line in front of another person, which is already pretty unacceptable and would get an audible tut. "
39,I read it like they grabbed the pants that were originally priced at $10.99 instead of the $19.99 pants that were on sale.
40,"Because if they bitch and moan enough, some places *will* take it back. Now they do it everywhere, expecting the same results."
41,"&gt;SL: No honey, you're wrong.

""Ma'am, I work here, you don't. Now, you can trust me on how our store operates, or you can piss off. Either way I don't get paid enough to care.""

*Sigh... If only..."
42,"The worst part is in software sales, it's kind of the opposite. Kill me now."
43,"Wait, wait a minute? Are you saying a customer accepted that you were out of stock of something and DIDN'T insist you look in the back? 

Cos you know these shop workers love nothing more than NOT putting stock on shelves for customers to buy!

Can you tell I've worked in retail a looooong time :/ 
"
44,"""Gaming attendant""... trying to figure out how video games or tabletop RPGs require attendants...

Oohhh, a CASINO. They're calling *casinos* ""gaming."" NOW it makes sense."
45,and more often then not her quick question will lead to more which will then take up 20 minutes of your time. Now you have 10 minutes to get your store opened.
46,"I just got yelled at for accusing a customer of lying because I told a customer she had her medications and change.  But of course, I'm the stupid cashier and she knows everything.  Well, after she checked her pockets, there were the meds and after an audit of the till, it's even.  So, apparently, I the stupid cashier was right."
47,"Of course, if you had opened it for them, they would demand a sealed one to buy because they don't want one that is already open. "
48,"With software there isn't an inventory, there's just the cost it takes to develop it. So in that case 5$ for something would be better than nothing if they weren't gonna buy it anyway. That's why its popular to do that with video games."
49,Natural Selection 
50,"""We have to clean the floors, because if they were still dirty when unsupervised kids were running and jumping around and hurting themselves while their parents stood there doing nothing, their injuries might get infected."""
51,"So are namaste tattoos becoming the new ""pointless kanji"" tattoo?"
52,That just sounds like an insanely bad attempt to steal someone's stuff
53,"It's always amusing when Marines talk negatively about the Air Force. I have the utmost respect for them and the work that they do, but if they enjoy rivalry then I can too.

""We each have our strengths and weaknesses. I've got the brains, you've got the ASVAB waiver. We all bring something to the table."""
54,and now you have a display that is missing it's sign until an employee can run that one back. If you're lucky he didn't damage the sign or the holder so it can be put back up easily.
55,"ARGH! I hate people who don't expect to see a woman in an even *slightly* technical role, and who assume we are just there to take notes and make tea. 

If you've ever tried the way I make tea, you'd know that's NOT one of my primary skills...! "
56,"I'm much angrier at the employer. How out-of-touch are they with their store? Squeeze the employees with understaffing, then punish them when they fail to meet unrealisticic standards. Sounds horrible."
57,"One time these two kids / girls came in probably like 11 or 12, told me they were looking for photo printer paper, general crafty stuff for a friends scrapbook, trying to figure out if they had enough with their $20. Made me think back to when I was that age and liked doing crafty stuff with my best friend with the $20 my grandma would give us to go shopping and have fun. I told them I had ""coupons"" and just took 50% off, figured fuck it I do it all the time for people who complain they do know how to print email coupons/ their coupons expired, etc. these girls were much nicer and more grateful anyway "
58,"That is one of the best written stories I've read in a Tales From sub, and also one of the funniest. 

Although with your dialect it's hard not to imagine you as Hagrid. ""Oh I should naht have done thaaat.... Oh well."" 

MOAR TALES PLEASE! "
59,I hate to admit that I did this but one time when I worked at a grocery store who I know their return policy is pretty lax. I had some backs of half used cat food that my cat wouldn't eat at all that I've had probably over a year. I didn't have any money to get to work cause my store was a 20 mile drive.  I went to the store that was a mile from my place running on fumes with all those cat food bags and asked to return them. They gave me cash back for them and I was able to buy gas. Normally I'd never do that.  I was desperate for gas money and my parents refused to lend me any and the money I made barely paid for my car note insurance and gas.  This was when I was way younger and dumber with money. 
60,Exactly. We all know it isn't just one quick question. 
61,I imagined you turning into one of the sloths at the DMV in Zootopia while you were cutting the fabric.
