0,She started crying like wtf. Is she a 4 year old that bawls her eyes put when she doesnt get what she wants.
1,This lady sounds like she is a real hoot. She was probably just bored and felt that some one had to hear the reason why she is doing this to her friend. Some people just talk to talk.
2,Old lady troll level = expert
3,"&gt; I WILL SEE YOU IN COURT

Well at least next season of Judge Judy is gonna be an interesting one! "
4,Sounds like he was pretty anal about the whole thing.
5,"I'm in awe of you. You moved literally over 1 ton of product, by yourself, no forklift, in less than half an hour. I mean screw that guy for coming in so late with such a large purchase, but you're a warrior woman for accomplishing all of that in only half an hour, I would have been there till midnight."
6,"Best one I read a few years back mother and young son in a music store.  Son is climbing on a wall fixture with high end display guitars, employee tries to get the kid to stop and mom starts yelling at the employee for trying to stop her son.  The employee is explaining to the mother that he is concerned about her kids safety and that if he breaks the guitars she is going to have to pay for them.

She keeps arguing that her kid isn't doing anything wrong when BAM the whole wall display comes down.  Kid was OK but mom wound up shelling out about five grand for broken guitars (after being told she will be arrested and prosecuted if she doesn't pay).

The rare story when someone is held accountable for their poor decisions is very satisfying."
7,"I worked at a gas station.


 The gas station has changed ownership and also name 3 times in the last 5 years. 



 In the most recent ownership change, we decided to go 24 hours instead of closing at 11pm. Until recently, the place closed every night at 11.


In my state lottery machines go down for batching and updates at midnight sharp, and remain down until 3am. Every night, no exceptions. It has been this way for many many years. During this time I can sell scratch-offs, but I cannot sell machine lotto or check either kind of tickets, or make any payouts. 


1 week after we went 24 hours, I had a customer come in around 2am after pumping gas. 


C: Here, this should cover my gas. *Hands me a handful of scratch-offs*


M: Sorry, the machine is down for another hour. I can't check any tickets. 


C: .....then turn it on. That's the only money I got, those winners. 


M: Sorry ma'am, I can't. It's a statewide thing, it happens every night at 12am until 3am. Nothing I can do about it. 


C: Well I know that's a lie. I came in here a couple months ago at about the same time and had my tickets paid out, so call your manager and do what you need to do to turn that fucking thing on. 


M: ..... ma'am we've only been open past 11pm for a week. There's no way you came in at 2am a couple months ago. 


C: *starts turning red* Well whatever, maybe it was earlier this week. All I know is, you can turn it on. Do it. 


M: Ma'am I've worked every night since the switch. But all this is irrelevant, because all the lotto machines in the state have been going down at this time for many years. I'm sorry, you'll have to find another way to pay for your gasoline. 


C: Oh for fucks sake. Give me a phone book. 


M: *hands her a phone book*


At this point she called another gas station a mile or two down the road to ask if their lotto machine was on. I don't know precisely what was said on the other end but they obviously told her what I told her. She got mad and slammed the phone book down. 


C: Well I guess I have to go get my credit card, because no one in this city knows how to do their job! *starts walking away*


M: Ma'am, I need you to leave some identification or something, you don't have permission to leave without paying for the gasoline you've pumped. (I have to say something along these lines, or in my city it's not considered a drive off and not able to be prosecuted if they came inside and I didn't make it clear enough they can't leave without paying)


C: *flips me off*


So I waited about an hour, she never came back. Printed a drive off and called the police. She was fined, and paid for her gas a couple days later. 


The length that some people will go to to avoid admitting they're wrong is truly astounding.

8,I would not recommend putting lemon juice on your skin or mixing it in a salt scrub for that matter. You should check out [r/Skincareaddiction ](www.reddit.com/r/skincareaddiction)  for acne solutions that will make your skin happy and not irritated.
9,These are the idiots that don't actually know how any of this stuff works.  They think there is just a big box of money in the back next to all the merchandise we're hiding from them. 
10,That's what confused me. She was well in her 30's.
11,"""I am offended that I'm wrong.""

""Yeah, it sucks being wrong. Have a nice day!"""
12,"I've always loved the ""valued long time customer"" line. It's just about always BS but it's lovely when you can catch them like that."
13,"I'm not one for reality shows; but I'd love to watch people like her ""win"" an all expense paid ""vacation"" to the southern USA. "
14,"With in the first hour she'd get a ""oh bless your heart"". "
15,"Two weeks later:

""He is now my boss."""
16,"I am a social services worker and I see this kind of behavior all the time.  I think people who don't have a lot of control over things happening in their lives have this need to feel powerful.  They treat us this way because they know they can! Sad but reality...  Just know that most of the people you serve WILL appreciate what you do, even if you do get the occasional rude person.  Sorry this happened to you!  Sounds like you have a great boss that backs you up, though."
17,"A quick correction: All through your post, you called these two women ""ladies."" Obviously a major error."
18,"I work in a library. If I had a dollar for every longwinded explanation I got from a patron about why they need to use a computer, I wouldn't have to work in a library.

Hint: we don't *care.* It's not relevant to anything."
19,Yes he was! We both busted up laughing and he told me how stupid he thought this woman was.
20,Middle aged women are the most likely shoplifters 
21,Woohoo! I am ready for my fifteen minutes of fame!
22,"&gt; I guess some people just can't read.

Customers. *Customers* can't read. It's kind of a fact of life. :p"
23,Charge the woman rent (50% price) to hold it for a day.
24,"My boyfriend works at a gas station, and reading this story makes me glad we live in a place where you HAVE to pay for your gas before you pump it."
25,"This man spent all that time for a single goddamned dollar. And doesn't have any information to do the return anyways?

What a twit. I feel pitty for anyone who has to deal with him on a daily basis."
26,"I've had so many people give me a hard time about being called ma'am that now I call them all ""miss"". For some it's an age issue. They think that being called ma'am means that they are old."
27,"&gt; I don't know what I did to make her start bawling. Tears are running down her face like crazy. She yells ""FINE"", throws both chains at me and storms off. 

Was either mentally unstable or was pissed you told her no because she was so used to getting her way. If it's the latter you can be sure she wasn't going to bring them back anyway. "
28,"I didn't realize she left them until I had finished picking her change up off the floor, and she was out the door by then. Normally I would send a bagger to find her in the parking lot, but I just put the items in go-back and rang out my next (much more pleasant) customer."
29,"Picturing you staring at the raised fist, then sighing and hanging your head as you return it."
30,The world is a better place when people are nice to each other
31,He was probably referring to a skink. They are commonly referred to as a snake with legs.
32,"It's funny that teenagers usually get profiled as shoplifters, but from my experience you're right, it's usually late 30s to early 50s women that shoplift. Pretty weird."
33,This subreddit has taught me that the human stupidity is infinite so I have to ask: the second customer was joking right? :)
34,I never had bad acne as a teen and then all of the sudden in my 20s it hits hard. I'm 24 and it blows my mind that people think it's okay to try and advice me on it. Completely unsolicited. Someone told me to make sure I wash my face with soap twice a day...Fuck off. Working customer service jobs with acne sucks.
35,"The rare unicorn of witnessing Karma in action.  You are truly fortunate.  Now, go inside and get a copy of that security tape so you can watch it on loop.....and put the gif on here for us to enjoy!"
36,"But... if.... you really wanted certain items, ring them up first. Then add on. 

Logic is lost on these people. "
37,http://m.imgur.com/eF8kh6w?r
38,"More like screw management for not having employees trained and staffed to use all appropriate equipment.  

Yea, the guy was cutting it a bit close, but the store isn't closed until it's closed.  Shame on the managers for staffing a section by themselves that isn't certified on the forklift.  

And it isn't hard to do FL training.  It is a pretty easy thing to do.  "
39,"If he works in retail, he should know that you can't just hand out discounts all willy-nilly "
40,"I can hear it now: ""Well bless your heart. Aren't we special? Manners aren't outdated down in these parts."" 

*Please read with the most southern accent ever, as stated by plump, short woman.*"
41,I like her already
42,Sounds like she was in the men's bathroom
43,The poor kid probably has learned just to keep his mouth shut by this point.
44,"No clue! Maybe she had us confused for somewhere else, because in all 24 years of business, my boss said we have never once held a cooking class!"
45,"Nice work!

Keep in mind that the people who do this are *not* feeding their families out of desperation; they are participating in Organised Retail Crime (ORC). When they get away with a cart full of high value groceries, they often post a ""flash sale"" on a private facebook group or elsewhere, where they sell the items to other thieves or those who don't mind supporting this.

We had to have the police take away this little old man we caught doing this. Of course his ride ran and left him to take the heat.

I guess you could save some money this way... as long as you don't mind eventually going away to prison for a Felony."
46,But it just looks so much prettier with the slash in front
47,Now I just want to know more about this old lady. What else has she pulled? We'll never know. 
48,"&gt; ""I work retail too!""

&gt; ""Really? Why didn't you go into the back to get the item you wanted?"""
49,"I remember one customer I had years ago whose name was ""Mammie."" This was her real name on her ID. And when I called her ma'am like I do with every other woman, she got furious with me. 

She says to me ""My name is Mammie, NOT ma'am!""  

Evidently she thought I was just shortening her name, even though this was before I even knew her name (she hadn't given me her credit card or ID yet). I told her I address every woman as ma'am and guys as sir, but she still walked out in a huff. I'm still baffled by this encounter. "
50,"My SO worked at the same kind of store for a long time and has said that this type of thing happened a lot. Apparently it was always drunk contractors/landscapers that decided to go to happy hour before getting everything they needed for work the next day.

/csb"
51,"Everybody is assuming that she was just a grown-up brat, which I've learned from this sub is definitely possible, but I kind of wonder if something was going on in her life. I definitely have seen people become irrational or unreasonable when a family member dies and they're trying to put together funeral arrangements and such. I feel like starting to cry is so unusual I'd want to giver her that benefit of doubt in this case."
52,"I'd just like to say that I was starting to miss your stories so I'm glad to see you still posting.

Hope everything gets sorted quickly on the house too."
53,"Let us know when he's fired for incompetence, we all know it won't take long."
54,"Seriously, you should go. There's no rule saying you can't be friends with an elderly person. My husband and I hang out with the guy upstairs from us who is in his 80s. He was a professional pianist in his younger life and has fascinating stories about all the things he's done, including having dinner with Idi Amin. "
55,"It's all those years of experience. And she didn't even have the internet to learn from, she's just been trolling for decades."
56,"protip: on Reddit, you can just do /r/ and the subreddit instead of formatting it like a link

/r/talesfromretail"
57,"&gt; She then proceeds to stand in front of my register looking over her receipt for about five minutes.

Did she then come back to yell and blame you for her meter running out on her?"
58,"Exactly, I keep my extra money next to that strange foot ointment I'm not putting on the shelf. Literally the only thing I have in the back room at my grocery store is soda and bread. If I get a truck you might find some chips or cookies the morning after. "
59,"Another error would be calling them ""customers"".

Technically, these women are vandals. "
60,"The thing is, he was going to end up getting $6 back for an item he paid $1.50 for and all he had to do is go to his car to get his license, but that was too much for him."
61,"Gotta fight crazy with crazy. Should have said ""Well, I was TOLD we did not have COOKING CLASSES."" ""Clearly one of us has been lied to and I'm just as mad as you are!"" ""What's the name of your lawyer?"" ""Is he taking on new clients?"""
62,Please tell me you didn't remind her she forgot her items!
63,"""That is how I would lose my job, sir. Learn how to pay your bills."""
64,*That* is something i would like to do to people who particularly annoy me.
65,"Ah, yes, like the Canada shirts.  http://imgur.com/a/mHZ89"
66,"I've been wrong before. When the retail slave corrects me, I just shrug, say, ""My bad,"" and move on. Then again, I also know the retail struggle, and I swear cashiers recognize it when I'm out and about haha. Kindred spirits or something."
67,"They wanted you to clean the floor? WTF the audacity of people. They're  stealing, doing a bad job, make a mess, and it's your job to clean up?"
68,"I get ""Sir was my dad, and Ma'am was my mom"" from time to time."
69,"""I'm never shopping here again""

""Promise?"""
70,"I worked at the same establishment when I was your age. Having to lift up that much by yourself is insane and exhausting. I had 30 year old man who was in perfect shape just watch me load over 50 bags of top soil on a cart then into his truck. After I was done he just looked at me and said ""I guess next time I'll get someone who can do the job."" Most customers don't understand how much weight your lifting for them."
71,Who told her there were cooking classes?
