0,"There was a lady that would do this every time she shopped at my home improvement store. She'd walk up and say ""you can check me out now.""

Uh, no bitch, you can ring your stuff out yourself or walk around the corner to a register. Bye."
1,"&gt; Who in their right mind expects people to give things to them if they are short of money?

Especially when she wasn't even short of money."
2,This needs reposting in tales from tech support. You troubleshot a puppy. 
3,"""You're right, I should.  I've no idea what I'm doing here...""  *Puts money down, and walks away from the register*"
4,"""ger""

Sausage Fingers op"
5,"Ugh. ""You can..."" 
I always hated it when customers asked for things this way, like they're giving me permission to do the thing that they want."
6,"""Please don't give birth in my store"" that made me laugh

What happened next. You can't leave us hanging like this "
7,Manager should have rang her out.
8,"""They told me at that I could get Blinker Fluid here!  They wouldn't lie to me!"""
9,"My uncle must look similar to you. He and my aunt were waiting in line to be served at a supermarket when a guy asked him for a bag.
Uncle thought he wanted a plastic bag and kept telling him to grab some from the cashier. The guy ended up walking off frustrated. 
Aunt was pissing herself laughing while trying to explain what the guy was really after. "
10,"She listened to the woman and when I asked her what was up, she told me that the woman is *insane* and never to take anything she says seriously.

Dunno if she called corporate. Never heard back from them about it, so I assume she either never did or they didn't care."
11,Hahahaha that's fucking gold 
12,"I bet she got her order anyway

Even though that is not how it works "
13,Nintendo is horrible with sending out enough stock to stores. I wanted one of those consoles myself. Just image the mayhem that will ensue when the Switch comes out next year. 
14,"God damn I love these stories.  I love that you don't take that shit and not only do what you need to protect yourself legally, but go for the throat to let the ~~customer~~ dildos know that you know what's up.

Ferris Bueller you're my hero...."
15,"*Puts money in pocket, and walks away from the register*"
16,"Same basic thing happened at the one in our town. My wife was 3rd in line and the store only had 3 systems. The guy who was fourth in line jumped in front of her and asked for the last 3DS. As the sales clerk was getting it for him, the store manager whom saw what happened, said no and gave it to my wife instead. The guy absolutely lost it and only left after they started calling the cops."
17,"That's a great way to get shot by some off duty cop, or some yokel with a concealed weapon.

WTF would he wear a ski mask if it's just a simulation?"
18,"You guys should have some form the customer can sign off on, accepting full responsibility for any idiocy they are about to commit. Then, when this kind of thing happens again, roll up the form, and shove it up that dumb AM's ass."
19,"Personally, I think the manager shouldn't have made you go back. Unless I'm being paid, I don't work. Even if you hadn't clocked out, you were not responsible to go back. Still though, I suppose it was better than your manager threatening your job or something - as long as they pay you for those extra minutes which, sadly, companies try to steal from employees all the time."
20,"...and corporate says the customer is always right so give her a refund, a free replacement and a gift voucher as an apology for the inconvenience."
21,"In retrospect, to answer a few obvious questions…

No, I don’t really have cameras installed. It was a straight up bluff and I was counting on him not remembering since he seemed to have forgotten about the release, but I am reconsidering them now.

I most definitely would have filed a police report if the credit card company had reversed the charges. Because I had the signed release with his info, I was pretty damn sure it was him.
"
22,Indeed. If I had done that it would've set a precedent for her to continue expecting retail workers to give her clothes for less because she 'doesn't have enough'.
23,Props to the store manager for doing the right thing. 
24,"That's some behavior from a four year old, just sitting down and shrieking CANDY until they get their candy"
25,"""I'm sorry sir / ma'am for security and safety reasons I can't leave my post unattended but if you'd like help with your bagging the checkouts are just over there"""
26,"I would have done that on a keyboard too. Fuckin contractions. 

Actually, this whole story is about trying to avoid contractions EYOOO "
27,Something about restaurants and coupons just makes any situation 100x worse. We stopped doing the entertainment book coupons a t my work because it was a never ending battle to explain to people that buy 1 get 1 free meant you had to actually buy something to get your freebie.
28,Shh
29,So you think I'm just casually hanging out behind this register? 
30,"&gt;how I got to know my best friend of 9 yea

For a bit there I thought you meant the dog."
31,"&gt; Unprepared customer ""you've ruined thanksgiving"". Hangs up.

Maybe he was talking to himself"
32,"*Puts register in money, and walks away from pocket*"
33,"Crap, I thought this was tfts."
34,A couple years ago at my old store we had holiday decorations around the lobby.  One family came in and they were sat down just talking as their kids ripped decorations off the walls and threw them at each other.  It took a good amount of glaring from my manager before they sheepishly got up and put the decorations back up...which their kids promptly ripped off again.  At least they made sure they were picked up again before they left.  I guess.
35,"I see it several times a week. One time I saw enough cash in a customer's wallet to cover it, but she said she didn't want to break a $20 bill. She rifled around for change in her purse, then raided the penny cup. Still not enough. She took out the $20 and slammed it on the counter. Angry because I wouldn't let her slide. "
36,"While I try to be as professional as possible, I would not fault you for going off on this asshat of a customer. Your response to his degrading ""Go get a job"" should have been ""Go fuck yourself."" Sorry you had to go through this OP. Tomorrow is another day :)"
37,"Was she drunk? It's a wine, not a dog. It's not going to come when you call it...."
38,How did your manager react?
39,"But she was so sure she bought it from you

So of course that must be the truth  /s"
40,"We need a new flair up in here. ""Ashamed of Sausage Fingers"""
41,"Friend of mine got shot during a robbery because he tackled the robber (armed with a knife) at the same time a ""yokel"" shot at the guy and caught the bullet in his ribs.

He says he didn't even realize he'd been shot until the guy was subdued and on the floor, then he noticed he couldn't breathe all that well. It was another 15 minutes before the cops got there and the fire department took him to the hospital.

This story doesn't end with tragedy or a lesson on why you shouldn't have guns, the guy with the gun was well trained not just in shooting but also in handling accidental shooting and my friend is fine today. The guy that shot him brought him donuts in the hospital as an apology and my friend is dating his daughter/niece now. (Its biologically his niece but adopted her as a toddler.)

I hope they end up married, I just think that would be a hilarious ""how I met your mother"" story. ""Well her daddy shot me at the Feed and Gas...""

So I guess the point of this csb is... either be very careful pulling the trigger, or learn to handle an accidental shot and accept that the black kid you shoot might court your daughter.

If you don't already have a daughter, get to work on that. You'll need one to date the black guy you shoot.

(Note: I am still loopy from my cough syrup but this is all a true story.)"
42,"&gt; ""I want you to help me you disgusting waste of space.""

Right there is the point where I would have told her to shove it, or, if I happened to be managing that day, to get out of the store and not to come back. I don't tolerate people talking to myself or my coworkers like that."
43,"I only use self checkout if I have a few items, never if I have a huge cart. I always thought of them as extra express lanes, but if the store is really slow I will always use the regular lanes even for a few items. I like the human interaction and I don't want to be the reason they replace more humans with machines."
44,Was the baby named Crystal? 
45,"VP of Operations Bob says that there needs to be a list of rules for things like returns to prevent fraud.

VP of Customer Services John says you shouldn't fight returns too hard because it's bad for customer retention.

Both orders are passed down the line. Bob's orders are fulfilled simply by printing out a sign with the rules. John's orders are fulfilled by ignoring the sign that Bob had you print out.

Corporate bureaucracy is just as bad as political bureaucracy. "
46,Hi Closed Man! I'm dad.
47,Or enough brain cells to compute anything on her own.
48,"I was 1p short on my school lunch once, and was given it anyway. I counted myself very lucky and expect it to never happen again."
49,Well they did it in Guernsey. 
50,"""Would you like a bag?""

""Yes.""

""Paper or plastic.""

""Sour Kush""

\*red eyed stare*"
51,"You know how stores have security folk disguised as average customers?  They should have an employee pretend to be a crazy customer. Have that person throw a very loud public meltdown over some made up crazy- yet plausible thing to happen, and it'll set the tone for the real customers to NOT act like the crazy person in front of them. "
52,"So that is how this works, now isn't it?"
53,"*puts stop in pocket, can walks away from now*"
54,"Sir, I am the one currently working while you have shown me no proof that you have a job. You sir are a hypocrit. "
55,"They do that on purpose. They create an artificial shortage so that the media reports on it, which makes it look incredibly sought after and desirable, which encourages people who would normally not pay attention to buy it.

I remember when the Xbox 360 came out. Same thing: stores were sold out for months, and it was widely reported on."
56,"Well maybe if you stopped winking and nudging while stressing the word ""bag"" they'd stop making that connection. "
57,*headlight fluid
58,"&gt; C: But your sign says ""HEMS $5.89!!"" 

&gt; M: Ma'am, it says ""JEAN HEMS $5.89... you have a wedding dress.""

...  Yes, I had to say that before. Pff like anyone ever would hem a wedding dress for under $6. XDDDDD"
59,"Quick, head down to the machine shop and get me a bucket of steam. Quick! We need it to clean this part. Get movin' newbie!"
60,"&gt;bucket of steam  
  
I used to be a line cook in a restaurant and we'd hit most of the new guys with that one. We'd tell 'em we had an order of steamed crabs up and that we needed a bucket of steam pronto. The sharper lads would get it as soon as the words ""bucket of steam"" came out, but the duller knives in the drawer would go *""Oui chef""* and stand there for a second looking around helplessly, then ask where the steam faucet was. We'd tell them it was behind the soup forks, now hurry up, we have to get this order out NOW.  
  
Those guys never lasted long.  
  
The smartest guy we hired came back with a bucket of dry ice, smirked, and asked if cold steam would be ok. We bought him a beer that night."
61,"&gt;Im on mobile, but dont worry my formatting and spelling will be fucking *pristine* because I dont have sausage fingers.

This made me chuckle, *then* I noticed that you appear to have misplaced your ' key right up until the end of the story.  Oh the irony."
62,"Omg. 

I'm so sorry. 

I'm happy to hear you and the wee one are ok. Congratulations! "
63,"&gt; No, I don’t really have cameras installed ... but I am reconsidering them now.  

Considering how awesome security systems can be these days, it probably wouldn't hurt.  You could maybe even use some of the resulting footage for ""eye in the sky"" shots during the Fireworks Shopping Spree.  "
64,You have a good soul. I like you.
65,/r/storiesthatendtoosoon
66,"Oh man, this is why I could never work retail. At least when I worked phone customer service I could hit the mute button so they'd never hear me laughing at them. I would have laughed in this poor, sweet old man's face."
67,I hope you refused to. We are not slaves.
68,Sweetie? Nope. That is enough to get the minimum from me.
69,"""I want to have the self-satisfaction of donating and looking like a selfless person but not if it means I have to actually *give* something!"""
70,i'm laughing at her now.
71,"&gt;  I watched a woman smack her ten month old son because he was crying

WTF!!! I have a 10 months old. She cries a lot. That's the way she tells me something's bothering her. :( I want to cry from this. Hope nobody smacks me...
"
72,"&gt;&gt;general contractors and foremen

As someone who does a lot of work for those kind of people, I see a lot of tattoos. This dude is nutty"
73,I guess the whole work uniform with the company's logo on it wasn't a giveaway lol
74,"And that's when I'm like, well, what's the point of rules???"
75,"Makes me believe more and more the Chinese grocery stores here have it right, they wear gloves at the checkout and many of them wear those face masks. I actually wish the face masks would catch on here, I would wear them frequently."
76,Im not ashamed
77,"The form is a good idea, particularly if they are transporting the cake themselves.  Alternatively, when you saw the disaster in the making as you loaded up the cake, it would have been a very good idea to call in a manager at that time just to cover your butt.  Sure, it isn't really your fault.  But we have all worked in retail long enough and read enough stories here to know that when things go south, people will try to shift the blame to anyone but themselves.  And that usually means the lowly retail clerk."
78,"Dementia, it's a hell of a drug.  

Seriously- with a situation like that I would feel bad for the lady.  She was obviously a few Golden Grahams short of This Complete Breakfast and there could be a multitude of reasons for that, most of them medical, sad and terminal.  Yeah it's scary that she's driving, but it's scarier that she was alone with nobody to help her out.  That could be you someday."
79,"*puts register in pocket, and walks away from money*"
80,But the coupon says FREE on it!!!!!! /s
81,"First of all congratulations. 

Secondly, this has to be one of the worst stories I have read. You poor thing.

That guy is a whole other level of ignorant."
82,"&gt;Woman: I was just trying to leave, your cashier saw me. I pushed on it and it wouldn't move, and bumped my head on it.

So she makes a habit of leading with her head toward things that don't move?"
83,"&gt;...his mother hates animals.

If she can scream in fear while looking at a cute, fuzzy golden retriever puppy, she needs professional help.

That said, d'aww!  You and $GuyPerfect did all the right things for the pup."
84,Good for you OP that's really awesome
85,"That's the thing. It's NOT difficult to understand. However, the customer is a unique beast, which easily thwarts blatant common sense.  In other words: they make *everything* difficult to understand. "
86,"Or, get a job as a pharmacist in Colorado, then it will all make sense.
"
87,"I get people like this ALL the time. I work at a coffee shop and when people order the blended coffee drinks they'll either rudely demand a small cup for the extra or want a large split into 2 small cups so they don't have to pay the extra amount for ordering 2 smalls. 
You better believe i painstakingly measure each ingredient so there's absolutely no extra, and if there is, I dump it and rinse the blended pitcher before they have the chance to yell at me for the extra. 
If they're nice though, I'll give them the extra no problem, even if they don't ask for it. Being nice goes a long way, I don't understand why people can't understand this. "
