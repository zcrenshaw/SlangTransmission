1,Do you sell chicken pot pies?
2,Oh my fucking god I would've torn her a new one 
3,"In my mind, I'm picturing a scene out of Walking Dead... mindless zombies just forging ahead even though they're up against a glass door; bouncing against it again and again."
4,"Follow up to this story...

My mate who worked the day shift reminded me that he came back in the next day, on crutches, with $500 to fix the door. He apologised to the manager on duty.

I was home asleep so I didn't get to witness the miracle first hand.

Guess one of those things where alcohol can make you an entirely different person."
5,You're a nice person
6,"**CAN'T STUPID**
**OPEN  INSIDE**"
7,"Nah it's fine I don't have to pay for them. I'm a regular. The Pope knows me personally, he can vouch. "
8,"""Chicken pot pie, my 3 favorite things!""
~~Some comedian~~ Pablo Fransisco. "
9,"Someone who had robbed the same location multiple times without getting caught. Repeated success leads to overconfidence, which leads to sloppiness."
10,How strange. What kind of dummy would set out to rob a place with their utility bills on their person?
11,"I had a similar situation! A guy was being kind of jerky while paying for his gas and an orange juice. 10 min after leaving he came back and apologized and explained he had low blood sugar because he is diabetic, and it makes him really cranky, but now that he had the OJ in him he was feeling better. I told him that I totally understood, I have friends who are diabetic, and I'm a student in a healthcare field, and he was really happy."
12,Oh my god... Who ever thinks it's okay to just shred someone else's paperwork?! I hope they weren't filled out already...
13,"At least she said ""sorry."""
14,"&gt;for all my trouble

Excuse me?? YOUR trouble? What the f--"
15,"That reminds me of a former coworker of mine whose wife was a foreign National trying to get citizenship.

 They been working for several years spent many thousands of dollars when it finally came to the day that she was taking her test and do the swearing in of a U.S. Citizen.

 The next day I asked him how the ceremony went and he said it didn't, they dropped the whole thing she's not gonna be a citizen.

 when I asked why he said that they told her she had to ""denounce"" her former country citizenship... And she loved Panama so she was not going to say negative things about it just become a US citizen.

 I was kind of surprised and told him dude the word is ""renounce"" as in give up not ""denounce"" as in say bad things about.

 they literally gave up years of work and thousands of dollars on the spot because they didn't know what the word renounce meant."
16,"&gt;Ireland where we have country wide alcohol laws, can't be sold before 10.30am or after 10pm

My entire understanding of the Irish is a lie..."
17,I totally approve of this parenting. Kids need to learn some responsibility these days. Good job on the mother's end
18,Mineral water drives me crazy - always end up with bits of iron and gold stuck in my teeth...
19,I've been out of retail for 15+ years and still miss my regular customers.  They were the only thing good about that job.

21,"&gt;(call him BG for battery guy) 

I was thinking battery as in ""assault and..."" but still a good story!"
22,"Really? After she asked for the receipt the second time, I'd have sat there till she got off her phone and took her card out"
23,"Not that I don't agree with you but if the papers were so important and had employee info on them, why were they in the open around customers to begin with?"
24,"Self-employed is best-employed, isn't it?

When I had my place, they'd ask for a manager. I'd turn left so my back was to them, then turn right to them again and ask how I could help.

If they didn't leave then, I'd offer to get the owner, then turn 360 around and tell them to get the fuck out.

I miss those days sometimes, but it was a lot of stress."
25,"Oh god, I had this guy the other day:

We just got a new store email (which is strangely neither shorter nor easier to remember), and so I'm still trying to memorize it. I had been talking to this guy for a bit about printing and he had seemed to make a decision about what he wanted printed. So I give him the email to send his files to and go off to work on other jobs while I wait for him to email me. He tells me he needs to work on his file a bit. Fine. So I go about my business and keep an eye on him diddling on his phone and then making a phone call. So I start losing interest in him. Then about 10 minutes later I see him kind of perusing our paper samples, and eventually he starts twiddling his thumbs at my front counter. I ask him if he was waiting for something and he tells me irritably that he emailed me his files 10 minutes ago. Like, without even telling me. So now he's irritated that I've been ""ignoring"" him the last 10 mins and not checking for his file when he was also distracted by his phone and giving no indication that he ever actually sent the file. 

Some people. "
26,"Do people not understand that unwarranted touching is a no-no regardless? 

The first two ladies were complete bitches and the second one, while not knowing better, could've just simply tapped you on the shoulder or caught your attention some other way."
27,find the employee with the worst evaluation. he handed them up for shredding.
28,"I've had a slightly similar thing happen. I work in a clothing store and one time this lady was just on this insane rant because she didn't like the belt that came with this one dress and oh-my-God, the dress would be just PERFECT if it didn't have the belt! I mean, she went for a solid 5-10 minutes with it. 

When she finally stopped her ranting and bitching, her husband just stares at her and goes ""Here's an idea--maybe just take the belt off? It's not like they glued it on...."" 

My laughter could not be held 😂"

I love you."
30,"The headline reads, ""Liver Leaves Lifter Less Likely to Lift Again"""
31,How.. how at her age (presumed she is older) has she never seen Animal Crackers... ? Am I missing something here?
32,"&gt; I was doing a patrol of the outside of the building (actually I was trying to catch Pokemon)

I lost it here. hehehe  Upvote for you!

Good job, btw."
33,Now that was a good lesson!
34,"As my one teacher loved to say, ""The Lord must love stupid people. He made so many of them."" The longer I live, the more I find this to be true."
35,"When I read this I understood chicken and pie and was thinking ""Why does he like pots? Does he like pans too?"" Then I understood "
36,"I wonder if that would fly in a corporate store. Probably not. 

Must be nice to work in a privately owned business. "
37,In a way that's actually kind of sweet. 
38,"I worked in an outlet mall about 18 years ago selling luggage in a luggage store. The entire mall had no windows. None. Not in the stores, not in the hallways, and no skylights. The first time we lost power it was very upsetting to me. One second I'm selling some bags to this huge, intimidating bald man, the next it is pitch fucking black. There weren't even emergency lights. I thought for a moment I'd gone blind. I had never experienced such complete darkness. I had no idea there was a thunderstorm. Being so deep in the mall you couldn't hear anything from outside the building. We had to find a wall and navigate out. The next day my boss brought in flashlights, but the dipshit put them all the way in the back by the storeroom. Thankfully the next time it happened he was back there and we led a bunch of people out. At night you couldn't even tell where the damned doors were. In the day, once you got far enough down the mall and turned a corner, they'd be some light filtering in at least. "
39,That's where you call a manager and/or an LP associate
40,"It's a well known fact that, despite the name, common sense ain't so common."
41,"""Fan of Edison"" lol "
42,"""Lost money"" hell no. There's a thing called product cost. Usually, if things are on sale, it's to clear inventory, not make money"
43,"She literally just brought them to the counter with her other purchases. It's not like she forged them herself or anything. Goddamn, I hate people. "
44,"Don't be silly. All customers know we just order stuff from THE BACK -- nothing ever gets delivered, it just shows up back there, of course -- so it doesn't cost us anything. We can sell that $400 computer for $40 and still make money! /s"
45,"&gt; Cutie: ""what a nonsense!! If someone here is giving quality customer service it must be you!! You were a great help and don't let someone like that ruin it for you!""

She must be found and given a gold star for awesomeness."
46,"That's hilarious.    They really didn't think that plan through and thought they pulled off the perfect caper.    

Now, since they DO know the name of the person that reported the stolen merchandise, I'm guessing this is a family spat and a no-good sibling or in-law stole the items to try to get cash."
47,"Excuse me, I'm a bigot who wants to complain about something. Do you have anything in the store for that? "
48,"The one who slapped you, it seemed like she did it out of habit. I wonder who she slaps for trivial stuff at home? Her husband, her dog, her kids?"
