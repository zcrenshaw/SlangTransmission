0,"Maybe she's a crip



Edit: Thank you for supporting Reddit servers stranger"
1,"There's an old joke about a college kid in the ""10 Items or Less"" line with 20 items, the punchline is: *That's either a Harvard student who can't add, or an MIT student who can't read.*

I guess he was still sensitive about it."
2,"I had something similar happen at my gas station. A woman wanted to prepay for some gas, I asked which pump she was on.

&gt;**Woman:** ""I don't know. There aren't any numbers on your pumps.""

&gt;**Me:** ""Actually, the numbers are posted twice, once on the pump itself and once on the pillar above it.""

&gt;**Woman:** ""No! There aren't any numbers on your pumps.""

At this point I was honestly trying to be helpful, so I tried to point to one of the numbers visible from where we were standing.

&gt;**Me:** ""Well, see the numbers are-""

&gt;**Woman:** ""No. They're not there."""
3,OP is writing this from jail I assume.
4,Baha! This was juicy and well written. Can't wait to read more of your stories! 
5,She's definitely worked retail/customer service before. 
6,"Please, post my bail!!!"
7,"Was shopping the other night, saw a young (very early 20s?) drinking from a bottle of water in supermarket.

Thought makes sense, bloody hot day, perhaps bought from somewhere else.

Then her kid (&lt;10) said ""You are meant to pay for that"", to which she took another sip &amp; put the remaining on a shelf &amp; walked off.

Humans..."
8,"""I went to Harvard""

""Is that why you're paying with nickels and dimes?"
9,Another thoughtless and brainless customer.
10,"A little spotty now and then.  Had to fashion an antenna out of a toothbrush, some pencil shavings, and my cell mate's fillings."
11,"If this happened recently, you can absolutely take this to his state's bar association as that is just atrocious conduct by an attorney. "
12,"An oddly honest criminal.  He'll run drugs, but, dammit, he's not a thief!  That's an awesome story.  "
13,"It's only our job, why would we know something like that? The customer is always right. 

That reminds me of my first day on the job -- I mentioned it being my first day and the woman I'm ringing out says 'No, I remember you, you checked us out last week.' Wanted to say 'Uhhhh, they hadn't hired me yet but you seem pretty sure so it'd better show up on my pay check.'"
14,At least her kid knows she's a thief.

16,"&gt; One senior coffee

Give him a break, he's still paying off his student loans!"
17,"electrician here, can confirm:  3v is not the same as 12v"
18,"There are so many people who say thoughtless things. Today, one woman said something like, ""I'm so glad you guys are having this sale."" As if getting a small deal is worth the thousands of people across the country who will need to find work. I will never treat employees at closing stores the same after this experience!"
19,"Thanks!  Given the WONDERFUL vacation weekend, I know I'll have plenty more, plus LOADS of backlog stories!"
20,This. And threatening to use an elected position of power to frighten others for personal gain is just off the top of my head a big problem with this.
21,How dare you hand her the thing that she wanted!! /s
22,"Isn't ""modest flapper"" a contradiction in terms?"
23,So how is the wifi in prison? 
24,The world would be a much nicer place if everyone had to work at least one year in a retail/  customer service/  food services position. 
25,"The trick to successful drug running is to make sure you break no other laws. 

Pay your taxes so they can't tack on tax evasion, pay your car rentals so they cant tack on ""theft of services"". 

This gives them less ammo to go after you if you happen to get off on the drug running due to a technicality."
26,People who don't work food service seriously have no idea how often workers wash/sanitize their hands or wear gloves.  My hands at any given time were probably much cleaner than the average customer's.
27,[removed]
28,Did she also accept the change that you gave her and touched?
29,"Better question: Who keeps, and can subsequently locate, a receipt for a candy bar for three years?"
30,I am stuck in customer service purgatory.
31,"&gt; Right here it says ""80% less fat than a hamburger"". What does that mean?

He's asking this because all he sees is:

""80% hamburger.""

That's Customer Selective Reading 101. They only see what they want to see. ""I want vegetarian, but it *says* hamburger. Right there. So, clearly, it *must* have meat in it.

UGH."
32,Ha! I expected a cut up collage of different signs and mismatched fonts held together with scotch tape! Wouldn't have put it past a customer XD
33,"Ha! I live down the street from Harvard (some of it).  I actually heard someone say that in a store once and I laughed out loud.  I was like ""EVERYONE here either went to, goes to or works at Harvard dude, you're not impressing anyone""."
34,Not an electrician here. Can also confirm 3 &lt;&gt; 12
35,"I heard it as ""why does the sign say limit two (2) per customer? So the people from MIT and Harvard both know what it says""."
36,"I had a co-worker once who would spend a lot of time in the bookstore when he wasn't on shift to make use of his discount and get some studying done.

He was perfectly happy to give brief assistance to friendlies, ('Oh, it's right there,' or, 'here let me get someone who can help you,'), because well, friendly.

**BUT**

When obnoxious people did this same thing to him in full-on jerk-face obnoxious mode, he would get super friendly as soon as they started up and find out what they did for a living...

...and then proceed to ask them ten million questions on the subject, 'oh, you're a doctor? let me show you this wart,' or, 'oh, you're a lawyer? listen i need to file for blah blah blah,' or, 'oh, you do (blank)? listen, this is my problem, what are all your prices and how long does it take,' until they would inevitably say something obnoxiously synonymous with,

**oh, i can't answer that, ha ha, I don't work for free,**

to which he would reply

**'That's funny, I don't either,'**

and walk away."
37,"Ah, this calls for Basil Fawlty mode. 

Stand upright, pause, look around dramatically, and then vent: 

""Signs! Why of course! What an excellent idea. Oh look, what's that on the window? Is it perhaps not **signy** enough for you? Were you confused because it didn't waggle in your face shouting 'ding ding ding I'm a sign'? Signs. Right! Next time I'll make special signs just for you in the shape of a giant snowflake! **Soooo** sorry to be inadequate. Off you go then! We obviously aren't good enough for you, there's the door, don't let the sign hit you on your way out!"" "
38,Mom doesn't want her daughter to go to the dance.
39,"'Understood, sir, unfortunately, *I* didn't go to Harvard, so this is going to take me a while...'"
40,"&gt;I have been a mechanic for many years 

and how many of those years were profitable for you?

Seriously, I can barely change my own oil and I know you have to remove any plastic from the terminals on the battery."
41,"He hand-sifts the ground coffee beans each pot to ensure the beans are evenly ground.

Gloves take away the sensitivity he needs for this delicate process"
42,"Yeah my normal experience is people coming in on the holidays and complaining to me because we're open.   ""You know you shouldn't be open, you should be at home"" 

Ok, then why are you here.   The fact that you come to the store is why we are open."
43,I think you know where you were last week better than her. What an arrogant moron.
44,Yeah op! Write as much as you can before you head over to prison!
45,How much do you want to bet that the kid accidentally unplugged one half of the power supply from the other. 
46,"""I'm pretty sure there is a statute of limitations, ma'am, and I'm pretty sure this is a civil matter, not a criminal matter. The police may not laugh in your face, but they will laugh behind your back."""

49,"When I was a kid I had a nose bleed in the middle of a supermarket. My dad disappeared and magically came back with a bag of cotton buds. He opened them, stuffed my nose and put the opened bag in the shelf... thinking about that now &gt;.&gt;"
50,"If you're the guy who kept authorizing double tows...

*shakes fist*"
51,"Exactly. If I'm going to rouge my knees and roll my stockings down, you know I'm looking for trouble."
52,"There was once a rather large guy with equally large pants in my store.  He browsed quite nervous for a bit which of course made everyone notice him.  We let him go as security was already walking he ended up with an Xbox a remote and a few games in his pants. By this point the cops were called and waiting outside.  He became braver as he stuffed more in his pants so he casually walks up to the doors with management and security there and the cops on the other side and as he approached the second set of doors and thought he made it out Scott free his thigh muscles must have given out and he dropped the Xbox it fell out of his pants.  He looked up at the cops after everyone witnessed his folly and said ""That's not mine"". He was promptly arrested and they recovered the rest of the products. Funny enough even with all the footage and witnesses he maintained his innocence at his court hearing.  "
53,I'm not sure how to respond to this...
54,The moment she hit you is the moment you stop the transaction and call a manager.
55,Shortly afterwards my dad said I should have told him he looked more like a Yale man.
56,It sounds like she wanted to overdraw her account in cash back so she could buy what she wanted when she tried to pay with the declined check.
57,3 != 12
58,"Funniest thing about it for me is that flapper culture, to my understanding, was definitely a counter culture thing. One of the things flapper culture was rebelling against was puritanical thoughts on modesty so flapper dresses were basically designed to piss off that mother in the first place. I bet the daughter had some knowledge of this before going in."
59,"The appropriate answer to his question was ""you're in the jungle, baby. You're gonna diiiiiiiiiiie!"""
60,[removed]
61,"I feel you. When my store went out of business, we had the worst vultures ever. At some point, I refused to cashier out this one woman that was getting like 20 cans of beans for like $2 and could I reduce it more. I literally walked away, as a a supervisor, and my coworker took over. I was outside and she was done, and she was like, ""your prices suck!"" I flipped her off. She still came back the next day."
62,"1. Wrap a napkin around it. 

2. Place it in front of her.

3. Remove napkin without touching the sides of the cup.

4. Get screamed at for not handing the cup to her."
63,"""I went to Harvard""

""I don't care"""
64,"In fact you're completely right ma'am, this is an express line and and I won't be able to serve you and you'll need to go to another line. No, I don't want to argue with you, you are holding up the line for those that can actually read signs."
65,"&gt; ""That's not mine.""

""And that's why all the cops are here."""
66,[removed]
67,I'm... I'm a finance major too... What am i supposed to know? 
68,"Oh no, I am too stupid to count it properly the first time, let me count it a couple more times. Oops, your whining caused me to lose my count so gotta recount. :)"
69,"As you can see from my flair I know exactly where you are coming from. The other great people to get when you're store is closing are the ones who will tell you in the same breath that it's sad that your store is closing, even if they barely shop there because across town bigger store is cheaper."
70,Yeah I hate making myself food at home and then realise I forgot to wear gloves. So then I throw all my food into the trash and have to go buy a new house.
71,"Yeah I've also seen them wear gloves taking my money and then making something with those same gloves on.  That isn't hygienic but I think it helps build up the immune system, right?"
72,Oh damn. You and me gonna have a love/hate thing going on here. See I used to work in a call center as roadside dispatch for a certain trio of high profile rental companies.
73,"Yeah, nice try getting something for free. Stupid... 

And what's with the sweetie stuff? I hate when people do that. I usually use the same endearment or something similar back with them, that usually shuts people up. "
74,"No, she just took the cup and got her coffee."
75,"Translation of the translation, ""I'm a bitch."""
76,"At least she apologised and had a story behind why she did it. I had a woman shout, ""HEY!"" At me like a misbehaving dog when I turned to answer a question while she swiped her card. Lady didn't even have a question, just needed it to be all about her.

As for your customer, I hope one day she can make some kind of human connection with people again!"
