0,"&gt; But dad...

&gt; ... wouldn't a Barret M82 be more fun?"
1,Yell at me. Next person gets double coupons. Can't stop the nice train! Choo Choo! 
2,"Yeah. By the time I'd finished filing all of the internal reports, done my exit interview etc. a couple of local police had nipped in to buy their lunch so my manager had a quick word. My house was pretty much on their route back to the station so they followed me home and then carried on. "
3,Sounds like you witnessed a doomed relationship.
4,"Sometimes children surprise you. At the local art institute they are open late on Fridays and offer sketching in various galleries. There is an adults only section (meaning just grown ups) and then a family section which I avoid not wanting my drawing interrupted by loud short people. Last Friday I ended up in the family section bc the subject matter (Native American) looked more interesting. It was fairly empty until about half way thru the evening when it was filled with children. I steeled myself for loud bratty behavior but all was quiet. Later an 8 or 9 year old girl tiptoed up to me and whispered ""I really like your drawing!"" I whispered a ""thank you"" and she whispered ""Your welcome!"" I whispered ""Are you having fun drawing?"" She nodded and smiled and went back to drawing.

At least SOME parents still teach manners! "
5,"Oh my god, this happened to me. The guy kept asking for ""sour deans."" I'm asking him what it is, and he just keeps saying louder and louder ""SOUR DEANS! WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHAT SOUR DEANS ARE?""


It took three associates and a manager to figure out he was saying sardines."
6,Why do people threaten to kill people and commit arson so freely! ?
7,"You've just inspired me.  The next time a customer asks for something then takes a phone call I'll just stare at him/her for as long as it takes, standing and waiting very patiently with a smile on my face.  As soon as they're done I'll start to help them but then I'll take out MY phone and start a conversation while looking at them.  As soon as they start to show impatience I'll put up one finger (One more minute) but continue talking until they leave.  

And then I'll wake up. "
8,Why don't you have the dairy cow onsite?
9,"As a good-fitting bra is worth its weight in gold, that other customer was quite generous!"
10,The police followed you home? 
11,I love saying have a wonderful day when the customers been an asset or is angry.  It makes them so much angrier and they can't complain about it.
12,"All together now: ""poor planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine."""
13,"Twist, he was told that ""idiot"" means ""how do you say?"""
14,"I work in a shop that sells makeup, and I have to tell people not to smear the testers or products all over the stands constantly, and people get so ridiculously angry over it. I also have to tell people not to put testers on their face/lips/eyes, when people protest I just tell them how many people do it on a daily basis and how they'll probably catch a cold sore or a stye or something equally nasty. People are the most self-righteous when they're in the wrong "
15,"I can't believe your manager offered to personally drive the computer to the store. That is taking customer service to the next level, kudos to him.


Dad sounds like a complete waste of space though. What else could the manager have done, magically summoned it from another plane and placed it in his hands?! 


Hopefully the kid comes out a bit better. "
16,"&gt; I've worked retail before

I would have looked at her and said ""Well then you must know how annoying it is to deal with customers who get angry over policies that you can't control."""
17,Your dad is a smart man. He knew the guy had sealed his own fate with the toothpaste lol.
18,"&gt;This meant that I'd have to work through the entire day without so much as a toilet break as we are not allowed to close the store for lunch or leave the till unattended.

2 things, where the fuck is the manager? and fuck that policy. I used to work at a store that we worked alone Saturdays. Well the store would close for at least 15 mins during the day for washroom breaks. "
19,"Because retail culture has taught them that it's ok to do. You know that if you called corporate to advise you on what to do when being threatened, they would tell you to just give the ""customer"" what they want. Oh, and try to get them to sign up for the Rewards Program. "
20,"I can only imagine haha. Through that whole exchange he failed to look at me once. The guy was definitely in his late 50s, so if he had just went with the ""bad hearing"" excuse I totally would have bought it. 

While all the empathy is gone, at least he has honesty left in him. Silver lining? /s"
21,If you read the story you would know that he's afraid of the horses stepping into the now napalm filled holes. Plus he has a child and you know just how well napalm sticks to kids.
22,"""If someone is obviously grown then you shouldn't card them.""

Ok, sure sweetie. Because when you turn 18 you magically look like a full grown adult and not a 17 year old. 

If she has a naturally young looking face, she's in for a rude awakening for a number of years anyway. I'm nearly 28 and I still regularly get carded for beer and wine."
23,"Paint in Canada is sold by the gallon, also. He's just a idiot. "
24,That's me in a nutshell! lmao
25,"""There's a 99¢ sticker on the 60"" TV, so that means they can't make me pay more than a dollar"" -said no sane person ever. "
26,How does the quote go- If he's nice to you and mean to the waiter he's not a nice person.
27,Why not pour napalm down the holes
28,"&gt;you know just how well napalm sticks to kids.

ಠ_ಠ"
29,I thought for certain it would be sour cream 
30,"I had a customer scoff at me for not speaking French... she then switched to fluent English. M8 this is New Zealand, you're not gonna come across many people who speak French. "
31,"F: I'm going to get rid of those rabbits like your mother got rid of your baby sister. 
D: But I don't have a baby sister.
F: Like I said..."
32,"I have never understood the ""You don't have to pay for it if you broke it"" nonsense. It just makes people more careless and forget that items have value. 

I have a lot of respect for (usually smaller chain) stores that have 0 tolerance on you/your evil spawn breaking their products. "
33,"This is one of the most endearing stories I've heard about retail. I've never had anyone outright yell at me, but I've gotten nasty glances and impatient tapping fingers while I'm ringing them out. Good on you for handling all that stress AND catching shady customers! "
34,"Parent of a 5 and 7 year old.   80% of the time, they are super well-behaved.  19% they're wiggly and restless, but still respectful.   1% ... loud screaming insanity at the worst possible moment / location.   So yes, children can be annoying as hell.  A good measure of parental responsibility is how rapidly they remove the bratty kids or correct their behavior.   "
35,"That was pretty cool of them, situation sucks though, glad you got through it ok!"
36,"A Hungarian tourist (John Cleese) approaches the clerk (Terry Jones). The tourist is reading haltingly from a phrase book. 

Hungarian: I will not buy this record, it is scratched.

Clerk: Sorry?

Hungarian: I will not buy this record, it is scratched.

Clerk: Uh, no, no, no. This is a tobacconist's.

Hungarian: Ah! I will not buy this tobacconist's, it is scratched. "
37,"A store near me that sells a lot of glass decor pieces and craft stuff has signs literally everywhere that say, ""if you open or break an item, you pay for it"". 

My sister worked there at one point and a lady had her five year old-ish child with her. Five year old is wandering near his mom and spits some glass baseball decor pieces. In his mind, he goes, ""oh cool! Baseball!"" And picks it up...then proceeds to throw it, smashing it onto the floor and sending glass everywhere. The mom looks over and pulls him away but he goes back and does it again, this time catching my sister's eye (the employee assigned to that area was ignoring it). Sis was a shift leader and since those stupid baseballs were $15 each, she approached the woman and told her what had happened and that she'd have to pay. 

The woman looked at my sister, dumbfounded and outraged, and said, ""so I have to pay because *he* broke it??? He's a child! He doesn't know any better! That's not fair!"". 

My sister informed her that since the child was with her, she was responsible. The woman seriously said, ""well how do I shop and watch him?"" And looked at my sister like she had magically proved sis wrong. Sis told her she could pay or she was going to go call the police (this store is a local shop, they'll charge my sister for the price of the stupid trinket if she doesn't follow policy), woman agreed to pay then tried to haggle down to $20 since she was still buying other stuff for a project. Sister refused and the woman said she no longer wanted the other items but asked if she could use her coupon of 25% off a purchase of $25 or more for the broken items. Sister agreed and the woman left happy-ish. "
38,Because clearance totally isn't a discount in any way shape or form and you're just a mean mean cashier. Ugh. 
39,"""No we didn't lose your business. We willingly gave it up so as to not have to deal with you."""
40,I was talking with my boss about it and we basically agreed that you can't say you've worked retail and then turn around and be rude like that.
41,"Upvote for that ""TL;DR"""
42,"What's even better and more disarming is if you can say it genuinely. Like, throw in a genuinely sympathetic smile and say ""I hope your day gets better.""

It can make them realize they're being a terrible person, and I swear I once saw someone make that ""I should reconsider my life choices"" kind of confused and disarmed face as she walked away."
43,"Best manager I have ever worked for!! I once saw him curse out a guy who was parked blocking the loading dock (while we were receiving a delivery). The guy flipped him off and continued into the store, my manager proceeded to deflate two of the tires on the guys brand new Mercedes!!"
44,"Omg, the opportunity to have and use a come back like that is the stuff retail dreams are made of!"
45,I love your manager.
46,&gt; Some people like to ~~complain to complain~~ attempt fraud. 
47,"Good for you, quitting that place. Lack of support is bad enough on a job when the support isn't actual security. "
48,I really thought this was going to be a sad story where you were constantly being forced to turn kids away and teach them about sales tax
49,Some people are just in their own little world that's bubbling with anger to unload at the most minor inconvenience.
50,"Wow, your manager is great at relieving pressure"
51,"Next time this happens, only step back with one foot. You should be nonchalantly split stance with your weight mostly on the back leg and the front leg creating a not-too-obtrusive barrier. If they don't get the message then, at least you might get to chuckle from seeing them stumble over your foot."
52,"I did that to someone once, they were being a HUGE bitch to my coworker and I stepped in and fixed the problem and then gave her the classic Customer Service Smile™ and said ""Have a *wonderful* day, Ma'm. I really hope the rest of it is better than this."" 

She showed up back at our counter like 3 hours later with a cup of coffee for my coworker, she apologized and ended up giving her a huge hug. My coworker almost cried, she'd worked there for ~15 years and that was the first time anyone had ever apologized. "
53,"Having bought a couple of bras for women, a good bra costs its weight in gold."
54,"I really thought this was going to go in a different direction - regular customer doesn't come in, somebody worries, sees something suspicious, smashes door in, etc.

I like this better. "
55,"Fresh, minty karma."
56,"Also, wtf kind of store only has one employee available to help on the floor or load large orders like those in this story if they have as much business as they did on the day OP was alone? "
57,Damn you (and her). Now I won't be able to eat my tots without thinking of them as mashed potato pellets. I'm about to throw some tea into the closest body of water as retaliation
58,I like that regular and the mental image of him throwing his friend out. Very nice. 
59,"&gt;M: *Still doesn't look up, but kinda tilts his head in her direction* What? What's wrong? 

You're a jerk, that's what's wrong...this definitely isn't the first time he's done something like this. And his obliviousness means he'll likely never learn."
60,"We're not supposed to accept tips.  That's why I tried to deny it.  

But we don't really have any rules for when the customer just abandons the money with you. "
61,"M, as in Mancy. "
62,[removed]
63,"""I did!""

Boy we got a bright one on our hands."
64,"To the OP: Check your state laws -- Not getting a break/lunch may be illegal where you live. If you're under 18, it's illegal at the Federal level. Either way, a manager should have been available to fill in on the till to allow for reasonable breaks. "
65,Stupid laws for health require that fresh milk be cleaned and pasteurized.
