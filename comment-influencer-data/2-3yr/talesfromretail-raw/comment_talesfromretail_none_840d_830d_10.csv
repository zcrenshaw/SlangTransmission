0,"I'd give you gold OP, but I don't want to go through the process of doing it. Can you buy it for me, I'll send you a personal check in the mail. I'm good for it."
1,"Such a satisfying story there at the end.  It's good to know you had security there.  

Sadly Nintendo hasn't learned it's lesson yet, I feel really sorry for anywhere that sells a Switch or did sell an NES Mini."
2,TLDR: http://i.imgur.com/R4Nxppn.png
3,"""Right, so if you're going to pay with cash, then...""

I've had to deal with this before. It almost bothers me as much as 

""Credit or Debit?""

""Doesn't matter.""

""So which one? I need to know..."""
4,Dementia ðŸ˜¦
5,"I'm glad your manager allowed you to go back and cool off, and ended up voiding the guy's purchase and kicking him out. I'd have banned him (having to call security on your dumb ass means you better never come back), but at least he didn't kiss the guy's ass."
6,"This made me giggle, enjoy my upvote"
7,"&gt; I'LL BE COMING BACK HERE ***NEEEEEVERRR!!***

""I HOPE YOU TRULY MEAN ***NEEEEEVERRR""!***"
8,"'The sticker fell on it'

I read this and had the clip from the Simpsons where homer is like 'Oh, how convenient' go through my head.

It does make me laugh when customers get caught out and try and put the blame on someone else and then walk off"
9,He took off his goggles. Do not take off your goggles!
10,"Our store only got maybe three *maybe* four shipments of the NES classics since it was released in November. Total stock received was never made it to triple digits. And we're a high traffic store. It's the same story with amiibos, the 3DS, or literally any Nintendo product with any sort of demand. "
11,"Not banned? Unless they're giving him the opportunity to come back an apologize, he'll never be back again until he does. "
12,"Is it bad that I saw the title &amp; I was like ""well yeah duh it is""

I'm just as bad as the customer. Just take me out back and shoot me. "
13,"Give one of those hard orange sodas a try, they're actually pretty good lol"
14,"If your company has an HR department, GO TO THEM. Do not hesitate. Most larger companies have an open door policy that allows you to report exactly this kind of thing. I know you're new, but listen, *she is too.* That manager needs to learn how to interact properly with employees, or your store's going to start losing them left and right. And if she denies she's done anything wrong, well, that's what security tapes are for.

*hugs* from a former retail drone."
15,"I'd be calling him a dumbass in the back of my mind just so i could continue my day, and tell him, ""Sir, coins are cash. You may now use register 3. Have a great day."", and move along to the next customer. 

Edited. Errors have been fixed."
16,"That one used to drive me bonkers. It's like, ""Well then just choose one!"" "
17,"""I'll try and make a letter""

Yep, she's totally not doing this on the sly. "
18,"""Yeah I'll buy them for ya, FOR MONEY"" - that one guy from Rick and Morty"
19,"No tl;dr?  Well then THANKS A LOT.  /s

Where the hell does all the stupidity come from in the world?  There shouldn't be this much of it."
20,"Wait a minute, she's not insane? 

... Am I still on r/talesfromretail??? "
21,"I eventually changed my line to:

""Alright, are you gonna pay with cash or card?""

""Card""

""Okay then you'll need to swipe the card right there. If you wanna do debit, then you'll need to put in the PIN. If you wanna do credit, then I'll need to see the last four digits of the card number.""

For whatever reason though, people show me the CVV...I don't understand people half the time."
22,Wow. I'm positive that mangler didn't follow policy.
23,This is amazing. What was the rule that he broke ? 
24,"Just charge a ""out of hours"" cost
That will immediately stop this. Just say ""we closed, but I can still do this job for an extra $50"""
25,Guy seemed reasonable. Just thought he spotted a deal. 
26,Yeah that's immediately what I thought too. 
27,I've never been paint balling but everyone knows not to take off goggles *sigh*
28,"
&gt; ""Powder!""

""Well lady, in most cultures we say hello to greet each other.  But I guess I can't judge."""
29,Nintendo is paying the price with the amiibos though. People aren't gonna pay crazy prices on eBay or Amazon so they're buying nfc cards that people are making for waaaay cheaper
30,"One dollar, and she refused to pay it. Thats a bit ridiculous"
31,"I'm casually employed as a security guard (certified, licences and all), which has pretty much never come in handy for me yet, but if I ever had the opportunity to do this for a coworker, that's a badass way to say ""hey, I showed up for work today."""
32,"While I loath the decision not to ban him, at least his ass wasn't kissed and given a 10% discount for his trouble and the employee discount for what he saw. "
33,"*chases customer out door with pee vase*

URINE A LOT OF TROUBLE FOR THIS!!!

K, I'm done."
34,"It is, which is why he told her we don't haggle. A lot of people (for whatever reason) forget that we aren't just any ol' retail store. We're selling a controlled substance."
35,"I'd hope she doesn't. And if she does she loses the lame excuses trying to get an item cheaper. Why didn't she say something at the time? Her you seemed in a hurry excuse is lame. Where did she even get $8? Sounds like a bunch of BS to me. Nice try, lady. 

I have to ask, what did you say to I hope I come back? I would have said ""okay."" and then sat there til she hung up. "
36,"""Ma'am, you can't type in a credit card number, that's not allowed.""

""My damn bank! Where's an ATM?"" 

Never seen again. 

This has happened about 5 times in the last 3 months to me. "
37,A little concerning that he shows up the same days your coworker happens to not show up. Uh...he wouldn't uh....want you dead for any reason would he?
38,"I would like to confirm that it is in fact a similar situation with the Nintendo Switch, though stock is becoming steadily more readily available.

We offered several waves of preorders but had absolutely zero idea of when they would come in, just an 'as and when' estimation.

The best is when a customer would see us selling to a preorder customer and then be outraged that they weren't being given the same 'preferential treatment' despite just walking in and deciding they wanted stock...on launch day..."
39,Most  CVV's don't even use 4 digits...
40,"Hey, umm, so I just spoke to the sheriff and he said that Maserati in the parking lot is mine and you have to give it to me because it's mine. If you don't, I'll file a 12345 lawsuit and you're gonna be in big trouble mister!

(It's worth a shot)"
41,"Duplicate is where you duplicate something. Copy is where you copy it. It isn't duplicate - paste for a reason, yanno? /s"
42,"""Are you sure you didn't ring me out already? I understand we're both necessary to that operation and either one of us would remember doing so, but I will ask anyway"""
43,"""I found the thing YOU suggested and I'm pretending it was my idea. Ha! Told you I'd find it!"""
44,Less of a funny story/ annoying customer when you realize she is likely beginning a slow descent into madness. 
45,"The thing is everyone says they're making it scarce to drive up demand. But problem is, Nintendo is selling it at a fixed cost with a fixed supply. They aren't charging more due to the higher demand. 

Second hand sellers are making the profit off the high demand, not Nintendo. "
46,"Isn't there a law about selling liquor to idiots?  If not, there should be.  Then you could have denied her the sale."
47,That's what I was worried about the whole story. So glad the manager kicked his ass out. 
48,"sadly if the woman's husband was as shocked out her outburst as you guys, that really only points to something abnormal going on..."
49,"Ma'am, I'm sorry, you're not making much sense. I would be in violation of our liquor license if I were to sell to an intoxicated person, so unfortunately I'm going to have to ask you to leave. "
50,"This guy is class A, top-of-the-line stupid. Calling him a moron is giving him too much credit."
51,"You know I didn't even think of that. I didn't see the first part of the interaction, so I honestly can't speak about whether it was dementia or just complete rudeness :/"
