0,"Cashier: ""This line is for fifteen items or less, ma'am. After I ring up fifteen items, I'll need you to pay for you order.""

Customer: ""What? Then I'd have to write three checks!""

Cashier: ""Well, you can move to the next lane, then."""

2,"There needs to be a new UNIVERSAL rule.

If you are on a cell phone you will not be served.

I don't care if you're at the counter, in a drive thru, or walking around a store. Workers are trained to not interrupt people on phones, so if you want good service get off your damned phone."
3,I would have let her drag it out until she was legally guilty of fraud. 
4,"I love being that white girl that speaks spanish. Though I've stopped a couple thefts this way, that's not what makes it rewarding. It's the look of relief and happiness on the faces of the customers that only speak Spanish when they realize that they don't have to struggle to find the words they want."
5,"My sister worked at a grocery store many years ago and often worked on express. The ""limit""was ten items. She got so fed up with people going well over that she started to ring off sales at ten items and telling the customers that her register wouldn't tally more than ten. It didn't take long for them to learn to count!"
6,"""I AM the manager"" is such a liberating thing to say.  Love love love love love it.

(Even if I am underpaid)"
7,"I've learned that if I'm going to argue with someone, I better be 100% sure that I'm right before I make a fool of myself. This lady learned that the hard way. "
8,"Lady: I have about 17 items, is that okay?

Me: No, get the fuck out of my line"

10,I mean none of which is you or your sub shops fault. If she has a knowing allergy either A.) Don't eat out. Or B.) Inform the restaurant. She's an idiot that tried to kill herself last time not you guys. 
11,"The trick I used that never failed me was to just say something along the lines of - Let me just check in here so you don't get any surprises when you get home."" It's a way of accusing other people of stashing things while still checking their large items. Another approach is to just offer to remove all of the extra stuffing for them.

We have actually found empty wrappers and things like small jewelry in bags and totes so it's not a lie either."
12,"Lady, you're at a drug store asking about nail polish. You've officially waived your right to be a cosmetic snob. Go to that overpriced department store counter where you belong."
13,"I love dogs and your stories.  If you ever see that big ball of well-mannered fur, give him an extra hug for me!"
14,"&gt;...it's pretty rare to see nuns roaming around in France.

Really? I thought your country had a lot of roamin' Catholics."
15,If you think she actually learned anything from this you are almost certainly mistaken.
16,You gotta love the idea of someone attempting to injure themselves to prove a point.
17,"I find this story very satisfying. Somewhere, there's a gigantic Saint Bernard who regularly ~~receives~~ orders shipments of chewable toys. This is now the world I get to live in."
18,"I used to work at a coffee shop and I had a lady come in and ask for a coffee. When I asked her if she'd like hot or iced coffee and how she'd like it made she got genuinely pissed off and said ""I want my coffee. You don't know how I want my coffee?"" And then proceeded to yell her coffee order at me.
She wasn't even a regular. You'd be surprised how much people think you can read their minds."
19,"&gt; The last girl I talked to was an idiot.

""Ma'am, you must have the wrong store, then â€“ we don't hire any idiots. We don't put up with them, either. Good day."""
20,"Alternate spooky ending

&gt; M: ""Right, well, that's impossible. I died one year ago today.""

21,"Good on you for helping stop this nonsense. We all pay for it. My wife cashiered at a big hardware store and has similar stories. And the whole ""we can't accuse them"" thing always gets me. "
22,"Jealous- the area I work in has a high volume of tourists, so being fluent in a second language would be very useful. I took two years of Spanish in college but I've forgotten a good amount.

There used to be a white girl at my job who was fluent in Japanese (she lived in Japan for a bit). She would break it out to the Japanese tourists , who would get super excited they found an American to chat with."
23,"If this happens again, call the funeral home with the family's permission. The funeral director will be happy to give you the decedent' estimated measurements. But don't worry about getting it exactly right. Dress shirts and jackets are often split up the back to make them easier to put on the body, and get pinned and clipped to keep everything looking good for the viewing. "
24,"Lying works really well. The honest people think you are just looking out for them. I would say something along the lines of ""let me make sure there are no security tags in here. I don't want you to buzz when you leave"" or, if it was a multi piece item ""let me make sure all of the parts are included"". I only ever had one person get upset, but that was because she stashed a set of expensive curtains inside a comforter bag."
25,The holiday season really brings out the very best or worst in people. 
26,"&gt;OL: Can you please get someone who knows what they're doing to ring me up?

&gt;Me: Hi.

Had a good laugh. Thanks for the story!"
27,What is it with customers scratching people? Those stories become more and more. How could any adult think that's an appropriate way to behave?! 
28,"UPDATE: the saga continues. 

Was doing register backup, saw the arrangement in my line and my heart sank. The lady gets up to my register (she was NOT as old as I was giving her slack for), she discusses with me which of two colors of said arrangement at length, picks one, leaves. I pick up the phone not 5 minutes later, this is the conversation:
Her: ""I just bought a Fourth of July arrangement and I changed my mind on the color, I want the other one.""
Me: eyeroll ""that's no problem, they're the same code so you can just come in and swit-""
Her: ""I KNOW. I want you to hold the other one for me.""
Me: ""k bye"""
29,"Most likely it would be the same customers who abuse the express checkout lane, so much fewer people to ""teach"". "
30,Customer service is not your specialty huh
31,"I had a guy once call and ask for directions to my store and did the exact same thing as this. He called back and I helped him realize he made a right when he was supposed to make a left. When he made a comment about the last guy he talked to had given him the wrong directions, I informed him that I was that person and that I was very sure that I had not given him incorrect directions. How could I be so certain? My only directions were ""Go to Some Road, make a left, we're the store on the right after the big shoe store."" There was only one turn. "
32,I always figured this was the place to vent about the things we wish we could say. 
33,90 percent of customers can't calculate percentages. That's almost a third of all of them!
34,"I guess you guys laid it out pretty clearly.



.... I'm sorry..."
35,"If she were smart, she wouldn't have to slam her face into a light switch to make a living."
36,"That's amazing. I love how she tried to get you in trouble for being right, after she had the gall to be so insulting for no damn reason. Did you enjoy your [*I* am the manager](http://imgur.com/gallery/vPoiE) moment?"
37,"THANK YOU!!! I waited on a table of Real Housewives of NJ and their husbands and children yesterday. Princess Cellphone asks for cheese for her soup and I had to ask her to hold her soup cup up (table was at a really bad angle and there was no way I could get next to her). She kept scrolling through pictures on her phone and I stood there saying ""Ma'am, I cant reach your soup..."". Kept going through the phone. One of the guys finally got her attention and she goes ""Ok, ok."" And quickly scrolls through 5 more pictures. I should have just walked away."
38,I guess you could say he had a *[puts sunglasses on]* fixed opinion.
39,"Customer: ""What are you doing? Give me my money back!""

Cashier: ""Your purse was open. You can't expect money to stay inside an open purse. Why don't you just let me keep it?"""
40,"Sinful Colors is literally owned by Revlon too and they're probably made in the same factory... their ""gel"" polishes are exactly the same formulation too"
41,"Even when I'm a regular at a place, I absolutely do not expect them to remember my order. If they do, that's great. Otherwise, it is no big deal. Cashiers at restaurants and cafes have so many interactions a day that it would be foolish to expect them to easily remember any one of them."
42,"&gt;Customers seem to think there isn't an item counter

...and that the rest of us failed kindergarten.  I've seen sesamestreet, the count would be ashamed of you."
43,"That's the sweetest, possibly the most innocent remark that can have the best effect. Props to that lady! "
44,Oh that would have been so freakin good. 
45,What?  It would take years to educate all the customers in that area. 
46,What was she expecting?  $1? $2?  Like how cheap can you get?
47,"One time I held up someone's $10 to look for a watermark like I'm supposed to, and he did the same thing to the dollar I gave him in change haha"
48,In reality she'd just have to tap her debit card three times instead of one...
49,"When I work express I will make the odd exception, but honestly... 34 items in a 15 items line? That's brutal. If I was behind her with milk and bread I would be pissed right off. When I'm working express I do straight up count people's items and when they're way over the limit I will politely tell them that I am an express lane only and usually in that circumstance there is someone standing behind them with only 2 items who is super pissed off who I feel for entirely. It just isn't fair that we have these lanes for express items and then people try to beat the system. "
50,"""I'm sorry ma'am, but the soccer field is across the street"""
51,"&gt;No, this is damaged, you can't sell it anyways!

Thank you for pointing that out, ma'am. I'll be sure to dispose of this after I've finished ringing out your undamaged merchandise."
52,"I've literally told people 

""I will take you this time. But next time make sure you--""

""How about you do your fucking job.""

""Well I'm just saying--""

""And you're being paid, so shut up and do your job. You are so lazy.""

Seriously, I'm being way too polite and letting you off the hook and you proceed to be a wankstain. "
53,"I interrupt phone calls now. After a year of cashiering my fucks given are gone. I will ask you what I need to ask you and if you get annoyed you should not be on the phone. Most people are nice and will tell the other person to hold on. Or even say that they will call back. However some ignore me completely. It makes it very awkward because I will just stand there and wait. 

Or if they are really not getting the hint I'll ring everything up and never ask for the membership phone number and they will not get the sales prices. I've only had 1 person come back and complain about that. I explained to her that I asked her for her number and she ignored me in favor of the phone call that she was still on. And that I could return the products that were on sale and then ring them up again if she would like, but that I would need her to give me her card or phone number. 

She actually surprised me. She said that it was her fault because she was on the phone. Apologized and left. No sales prices. It only honestly would have saved her like $1.15 but most people would lose their minds over that $1.15. "
54,"Every. Goddamn. Time.

I honestly don't know why people think this joke is original.  Luckily I've never had anyone get offended by me checking."
55,"Something similar happened yesterday to a coworker of mine.

Son and father come in to look at laptops for son. The particular maker of the laptops sells them in their own stores. They have a student discount/deal where the model they are looking($1299) at is $100 off plus it comes with free headphones. They wanted the wireless in-ear version, normally $200.

We have that laptop on sale $200 off regular price, plus an extra $100 off for students. Our headphones aren't free, but are on sale for $100 (50% off).

Computer + headphones at our store $999 + $100 = $1099.

Computer + *free* headphones at their store $1199 + $0 = $1199.

Coworker tried to tell the father our deal was the best deal, even if our headphones aren't *free*. But somehow he just couldn't comprehend the deal. He kept saying: ""But it's free at the other store"" Coworker even tried using a spreadsheet with the costs, and even included tax. Coworker used excel function to highlight lowest cost. Coworker even asked ""so you're willing to spend an extra $100 to get free headphones""

Customer left to buy from other store. "
56,"I work at a convenience store and we have a huge competitor down the street. This weekend there was a bad storm and widespread power outage, including our competition. So their ""regulars"" were in all weekend complaining that our coffee was more expensive, the cream dispensers were hard to use, we don't sell Grandmas cookies, blah, blah. I wanted to just scream ""go there then. Oh you can't. Fuck you then"""
57,"She complained in order to establish that they know about it.  If she injures herself, the company was on prior notice of the hazard and did nothing about it, which means a finding of negligence and a fat award.  "
58,You can still prosecute for fraud. You just have to be able to prove she filed suit with the intent to defraud you out of money.

I find this hilarious

60,"I had an ex who got fired from a waitress job because she served shrimp to a table w/a child w/a severe shellfish allergy. Oh yeah, it was the father that ordered the shrimp."
61,"Yeah, but that would be the easy way to it. And the sane way. 


But we all know that she would insist on writing checks anyways... For reasons."
62,"One time a lady asked me why I wasn't in school.  It was 2000 and I had just turned 30, so I said ""Since I graduated in 1987, it's no longer required of me."""
63,"People can't envision percentages at all.   At my store, like most I imagine, a 10% discount is offered when customers are irate about something.   More often then not this will settle them down and they'll walk out thinking they scored a deal.

Yes, you scored like 50 cents off your item.   Congratulations."
64,Here in the UK if someone pulled something like that on me my manager would kick them out. I feel so bad for my american retail brethren.
65,"Don't be ridiculous, everyone knows that retail workers have the average intelligence of a four-year-old and have pretty much just graduated first grade. They should consider themselves lucky we even pay them 50 cents above minimum wage in this state!"
66,It didn't matter. She wanted MORE DISCOUNT! WAAAAUUUGGGGHHH!
67,"Luckily for all involved parties, this was one of those ""best in people"" situations."
68,"She gripped my hand, digging her ~~talons~~ nails into my skin. After that, she chopped my hand with medium force and recited the title."
69,"&gt; IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME THE FREE SANDWICH I'LL SUE

""I'm sorry, but due to the threat of legal action I may not continue this conversation. Our legal department will be happy to assist you"""
70,I thought it would stop being so fun but to be honest it gets better every time.
71,"Unfortunately there's no reversal of damages. So if she sues you for $10,000 and you put the tape into discovery, she can just drop the suit. It will cost her nothing, she won't be prosecuted, etc. "
72,We all know the customer got there 10secs before OP came to the counter and tried to play the poor service card to get served. Denied. 
73,"Please tell me you proceeded to put a post-it note on his form, and then wrote the word ""nasty"", with the biggest retail grin ever."
74,"&gt; The honest people won't care

Sure they do. Just like in the post here...

Lots of honest people get offended if they think you suspect them of stealing."
