0,Wait... we don't have to obey laws we didn't vote for?  Goodbye pants!
1,"OL later on facebook: Never go MoonStruckmouse's costume shop. They accused me of breaking a mask, just because I asked if there was one in the back that wasn't damaged!!! I didn't even ask for a discount. The assistant was rude, unprofessional, called me a liar and a thieve, and admitted to stalking me through the store!!!! Worst place ever.


The follow up story"
2,I didn't vote for there to be a public
3,"Good parenting there. The whole ""it's their job"" excuse is too often used to justify leaving behind a mess. Yeah, the custodial staff are paid to clean up, but being messy and making their job harder is rude."
4,"Good on them for honoring it despite their ""mistake"". "
5,"I'm half German and although I don't speak the language both my mother and grandmother do so I recognize it.

One day in line at a store I struck up a conversation with some German tourists in English by asking them where in Germany they were from and how they were enjoying the states.

LOL!  They all started talking to me in German very excitedly and I had to let them know that while I recognized the language I actually couldn't speak it!  They still seemed pretty happy to talk to me while we waited and their English was great.

Sorry, kind of OT but your story reminded me of it."
6,"I love stories when customers stick up for retail workers against other rude customers, it restores some faith in humanity."
7,"That's messed up. Ask your boss to check the cameras then ask which option he would preger next time.

Option 1: 
One complaint from a rude an inconsiderate customer. 

Option 2:
Many complaints from the four people waiting in line whom you couldn't serve."
8,"""You're right, it is the same thing! So I'll give it all back to you in store credit and that should be fine, right?"""
9,"&gt; This was 100% her fault. 

107.5%. Don't forget the taxes."
10,"&gt; I shouldn't have to give away this kind of sensitive information in this day and age.

 She probably already did, willingly, through social media."
11,Sounds more like his parents were cousins.
12,"I hope you can laugh at his absurdity now that it's all over. As I was reading this all I could think of was the episode on SpongeBob while SpongeBob is trying to get Patrick to open a jar of pickles. 

""The lid, Patrick. ""

""No, the LID. ""

""THE LID. ""
"
13,I'm convinced that customers think the signs are there to trick them.
14,What happens if lord forbid you left that store?
15,"I was stationed in Germany in the 80's.  (Heilbronn)  I used to go to the same WeinerWald for my half-chicken, fries, and Fanta.  At least twice a month over a couple of years.

I always ordered in english.  I don't like to use another language unless I am sure I am saying it correctly.  One day there was a new guy and he didn't really understand English.  Conversation:

ME:  Hi, I'd like half a chicken, an order of fries, and a Fanta.

NG:  ??

ME:  Repeat the order.

NG:  Walks away and gets another employee.

AE:  Can I help you?

ME:  Ja, ich möchte ein halb hähnchen, ein pommes, und ein Fanta bitte.

AE:  Looks at NG.

NG:  Looks at me."
16,This was 100% her fault. 
17,"Pants are optional, when not in public."
18,I made the mistake of trying to help someone in Spanish because they were struggling with English. They got super offended and submitted a complaint to customer service. Never again.. 
19,Considering inflation the voucher is actually less valuable now then it was when it was first issued so the store got some benefit out of the mistake too.
20,"Ah the old ""its their job, I am just making sure they still have one"" excuse. No person, you are not providing job security, you are simply providing physical evidence as to why that is part of my job description."
21,"I can understand her frustration... I fucking hate paper bags.

But I mean... I'd just buy reusable bags at that point. No big deal.

&gt;""Nothing."" *Cue shocked look, and the loud gasp of someone who's never been told no in her life.*

Tehehe."
22,"I used to work in Appliances as well at [Big Box Home Improvement Warehouse]. One day I had a lady taking a look at the refrigerators. After a minute or two I walk over and ask if she's doing okay. She says she's fine and is just looking as her fridge is on the fritz. This isn't uncommon from where I live, but I notice she's holding something that looks like a voltmeter (it's the best way I can describe it). After some small talk, I ask her what that is. She told me that it's a device that reads some type of wave length because she's apparently sensitive to wifi signals. She said ""Is your wifi router nearby, because I'm starting to get a headache."" It took all my willpower to not tell her that every second of every day she's being bombarded by all sorts of different particles and waves, not just wifi. Instead, I just told her to let me know if she needed anything else, and I went to the break room to have a laugh."
23,Don't give it to him. I wouldn't admit he was family.
24,"You are a hero, I would be thrilled if more store clerks did this!!! (I'm lookin at you, Speedway)"
25,"Did your shop ever consider the rule *you break it, you buy it* ?   
Created exactly for those types. "
26,I love this response so much.
27,"I'm from New Hampshire, we don't have a sales tax there.  This confused and upset me when I was 9 years old and trying to buy a teddy bear in Maine.  But that woman had no excuse."
28,"Maybe I'm supposed to ""pass the torch"" of his password responsibility to someone else?  Hahah I have no idea.
And this happens way more than you'd think. 
Or I get ""you don't have it on file somewhere?"" No...I'm not yahoo, Hotmail, or Google.... and even if I was, they don't just keep them and tell you what it is if you forget."
29,"My ex used to actually clean things at stores and I as a retail worker was completely weirded out by it. Once she cleaned a bathroom at a grocery store, not just picked up trash but got the supplies out of the nearby closet and scrubbed it. 


I always hated the ""it's their job"" line but I had to use it on her a few times."
30,That's so annoying and so classically retail. 
31,"Eh, he just didn't like how I snapped he said I should've ""handled it a bit more politely."" I kinda understand though I barely made an attempt to be patient with the lady."
32,"I had a customer tell me he'd rather give me his ssn than his email address. Disregarding how ridiculous that is, do people really not have a burner email address they use if they want to sign up for rewards? Plus our reward system was legit and not spammy anyway. "
33,"I swear, when people get onto retail property, they lose their brains."
34,"Oooooh, I really hope you guys can bring it down hard on these two. Theft for survival is one thing, but you can't tell me they needed $3,000 plus to eat that week."
35,Nice to see a story where neither the customer nor the manager are a jerk!
36,"I'm fluently bilingual and for my life still can't understand why people try mixing words that way. 

Wouldn't it be logical for the customer to ask for agua!!!"
37,Are.. Are you actually expecting people to not just read the signs..  But to also listen??!  What kind of store do you work?
38,"In Australia, if you even suspect alcohol may be given to a minor you have to refuse the sale by law and the customer can rant and rave to corporate all they like. Also any underage person would not be allowed on the premises without their legal guardian, and an older sister is not (usually) a legal guardian so Dad could have actually been prosecuted and banned from the premises in the future for knowingly allowing an underage person to attempt to purchase alcohol. Similar legislation exists for tobacco.

Good on you guys for standing by Daniel."
39,"Formatting looks fine to me. 

As for the holds -- None of her business. You already explained that items can only be held until closing time. Maybe next time, she'll pay better attention....~_~"
40,"""Sir, what the hell part of HE SAVED YOUR LIFE are you missing here?  Try 'THANK YOU.'  Also try the door marked 'Exit,' you are now banned.""

Fucking useless stupid."
41,"Someone actually asked me ""is this true?"""
42,"""Code Adam I repeat code Adam. We have a lost mother here who can't find her responsibility or parenting skills."" "
43,"Reminds me of my store. We had someone have a heart attack before my shift started. We called 911, one of the cashiers played with her toddler until someone could get her. 5 hours later she calls the store, and got upset that we put her groceries back on the shelf. She couldn't understand why we thought she wouldn't be back that day."
44,"You should have let your inner working class out, and yelled: ""NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME, YA' BLOODY INBRED SCUMBAG, WHAT MAKES YP THINK THAT YOU'RE BETTER THAN KAYE HERE, HUH? WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK HOME TO YOUR UNCLE-HUSBAND, AND LEAVE IS ALONE."" Or, something along those lines...."
45,Man... I wish our customers had been this tame when we had the same law passed here back in July. People actually threw stuff at a few of my cashiers.
46,"I don't like your manager, get me your pants"
47,Don't forget how OP was watching her through the cameras
48,"What she is describing is [electromagnetic hypersensitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_hypersensitivity). So far, there is no direct scientific proof that it exists. My mother always claims that long periods of time in large stores with a lot of fancy security systems give her migraines because of all of the EM radiation they put out.

For the most part, I am skeptical of this, but having worked with a lot of EM sensors at work, I know that standing directly in front of a  LiDAR sensor for extended periods of time when it is being used causes what feels like a pressure behind the bridge of my nose that leads to a mild headache.

That said, consumer-grade WiFi routers will not cause this due to the very low power EM radiation they produce."
49,Drugs... drugs are why people use coinstar at 11PM
50,"What answer are they expecting? ""No, we just put those signs up to fuck with you. It's hilarious.""?"
51,"No way, that's great! I don't think I'm ever going to know the feeling of being somewhere where my language isn't dominant and finding someone who can talk to me. I'm sure it's a good feeling!"
52,"I had a group of big burly Hispanic customers start speaking to me in Spanish (which I don't speak).  I could tell they were asking how I was and I know they speak English also so I responded ""tres bien, et toi?"" They stared at me for a minute and cracked up. They were my buddies from that moment on. "
53,"God, that must have been humiliating. Did he at least have his receipt with him? That lady should've given him a serious apology."
54,I don't like your attitude. Get me your manager.
55,"I swear, if whatever you are saying is not already on the script of what the customer is expecting you to say at that moment, it just gets tossed right out and they grunt/gesture/ignore until you say something that is on that script and they spit out whatever their canned response is for that particular question/statement. Otherwise, they are just absent-behind-the-eyes automatons waiting for their cue. "
56,"F that tip policy, is that legal?"
57,Look into getting a new boss.
58,I had this the other day. I speak French fluently but I live in Arizona in the US. I was at work and I overheard a couple having a conversation between themselves in French so I walked up and asked if they needed any help in French. They immediately lit up and started talking to me in French about how they are visiting and how they love the states. It's always fun to meet people like that! I've only done it a handful of times but it's always great! 
59,"I love the part where I think all hope in humanitiy is lost because the girls did actually steal something and it's your fault.

But this story is far better."
60,"When he went to get his change I would have asked him: ""Does the $0.47 really matter?"""
61,No wonder we threw their tea in the harbor.
62,"There is a point where I refuse to accept loose change, this sounds well past that.

Then, there is a point where I change my mind and push the pile of change back to the customer and void the sale to take the next customer."
63,"""That'll be 20€ more, thank you for forking over more money.""

At least acknowledge your mistakes, people."
64,"Omg customers like that are the worst -.- I've had customers do something similar and once someone said that I had to call the cable company for them because it was 'The store's problem' yeah... no, I'm not the one without a television man. So that didn't happen."
65,"Now THATS illegal. I'm not sure about OP's policy, but yours certainly was. "
66,"&gt; She couldn't understand why we thought she wouldn't be back that day.

Oxygen might have gotten cut off to her brain for too long."
67,"*Customer claims he never shops at Competitor*

*3 days later, he finally brings in the letter*

*Has Competitor's letterhead on it and wording indicating that he shops there every week*

*Still demands to know why you aren't giving him his points*"
68,"&gt;Before I get any backlash, I want to say that I can completely understand her issue

No one with a brain is going to give you any backlash, you handled her like a pro.

It's not your fault or concern that her or her company haven't organized the relevant authorizations to activate the tax exemption.

You explained all options to her in a clear manner. 

Her petulance and 'special snowflake' status are her character defects; you have the patience of a saint."
69,"I think the reason people hate that line is more so because of the attitude that usually follows. People expecting you to bend over backwards for them, purposely making a mess, etc.  It's perfectly fine to use the ""it's your job"" line if they are complaining about a task they are literally responsible for, reasonable of course. Like a Janitor complaining about having to empty out the trash versus him complaining people keep leaving gum all over (people are disgusting) the first is a reasonable ""it's your job"" line while the latter is an actual justified complaint."
70,"Tip policy's are bull. At my old cashier job, people would tip me constantly. But management decided tips would go in a box and be split amongst management only, despite them only sitting in the offices usually. It was to the point ai couldn't keep anything higher than a penny on my register from people leaving change, and if I accumulated ten cents in pennies it had to be turned in or risk termination.

And goodness forbid someone hands me a dollar and I forget about it for five minutes. Management watches cameras like a hawk, if you don't turn it in immediately, sometimes even having to leave the registers to do so, you are subject to termination unless you surrender the tip.

Never. Again. "

72,"To be fair, there have been problems in the past with some fabric colorants used in China containing lead.  As well as things like zippers and buttons-- a young child nearly died of lead poisoning after pulling a lead based ornament off her mother's shoes and eating it. That is why a few years ago the federal Consumer Products Safety Commission passed regulations requiring extensive lead testing of all kinds of products, including clothing, before they can be sold in the US. 

Since you say this happened some time ago, it is possible that the lady was genuinely concerned about protecting the kids at her school and had read something that concerned her.

Edit to add info on the shoe incident."
73,"So the kid's costume wasn't worth $3.20 extra?  *does math*  What, a $11 costume was down to $8.70 and she wanted it at $5.50?  Kid wasn't worth $8.70?

*mutters*  Some parents.  Don't think the kid can't figure out that they weren't worth the extra $3.20 to the parent.

"
74,"I wonder if once he got in the car I clicked in his mind.
Because I've has brain farts like that where maybe 10 mins later it will be painfully obvious how what I thought made an impossible lack of sense. "
75,"How awful. For you and that poor girl. She must have been so confused. Getting yelled at sucks, but it sucks even more when you don't know why you're getting yelled at. "
