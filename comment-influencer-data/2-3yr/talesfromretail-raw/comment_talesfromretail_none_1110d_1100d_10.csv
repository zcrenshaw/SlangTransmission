0,Hail snack man.
1,He made a snackrifice
2,"I was *not* expecting that outcome!!

What a twist!"
3,"Ugh. Those shoes fit him just fine. He ruined them, and he knows it. That is why he left them behind like he did. He and his attitude can go on somewhere."
4,"Indeed. My god the amount of angry customers I had to deal with while we closed down. ""I'M REPORTING THIS SHOP TO TRADING STANDARDS"". We were crawling with auditors and accountants, everything was done properly."
5,"If she ever shops at a dollar store, she's going to have a bad time. "
6,"When I worked at a rural bank, we had lots of old people who would come in and draw out their entire social security payment for the month in cash and leave with it. They didn't want to hear anything about how the money would be safer in the bank, these were the kind that hated and mistrusted banks.

One month a couple came in and drew out like $1600 dollars as usual. They came back an hour later and told me that they had dropped the envelope while they were out shopping and couldn't find it. They wanted a refund.  It was so preposterous I actually didn't know what to say to them. 

Edit: not a refund, poor wording there. They wanted us to replace it like a cashier at a gas station might replace your fountain drink for free if you drop it or whatever."

8,"&gt; Customer: ""you mean, you all don't have an iron and ironing board like in the back or anything?? I've never heard of that!!""

Hell, I don't even iron my own clothes - why would I iron yours?"
9,"We've all been there, brain wires malfunction lol "
10,"I used to have a guy come in and all he would say to me was ""Camels"" and I would ask ""Which kind?"" And he would just say angrily ""Camels! There's only one kind!"" (for those of you that don't smoke or know, Camel has at least 13 different kinds.) Thinking he might want the unfiltered as it was probably the first Camel, I would try to hand those to him. Nope. Wrong. He wanted filtered kings. "
11,She's going to come in and try to return them 1 at a time for $50 each. I guarantee it.
12,"Must be legit, it was on Facebook.

Guess I'll find a new coffee shop. That's a pity, Satan's Aborted Fetus Coffee was right on my morning commute."
13,feels good man
14,Pretty sure I may have worked for the same retailer in the past. Had a guy come into my store with a magnet tool to unlock my peg hooks. Inattentive cashier with their back to him processing trades never turned around as he filled his oversized pants and sweatshirt with about 6 new DualShock 3's. That was a fun one to explain to the DM.
15,Sidenote: I love it when customers have photos on their phone of promotions/signs. It helps so much!
16,"He was awesome. He's inspired me to buy food for cashiers a couple of times, if I notice they're looking glum at the desk.

And I'm all good. This was actually a while ago. One of the guys from head office started his own business and poached me from the shop floor!"
17,"As I recall, the boots appeared to be OK structurally; they were just worn and dirty as they would be after a hike (and lack of cleaning). Maybe he confused us with another outdoor retailer with a particularly open return policy."
18,"I hope you said to him at that point, ""looks like there's more than one kind after all."""
19,"My grandmother says something similar if she's asked that: *""I've been cooking for and cleaning up after a soldier for 40 years, isn't that enough support?""* It's half awkward and half funny each time."
20,I can't believe how careless some parents are. I mean the poor kid doesn't know any better you'd think the mother would exercise some common sense.
21,"Get manglement to get those doors fixed, or at least change the doorknobs. "
22,Being able to say no to a customer with no repercussions... It's a feeling like no other 
23,"He didn't get the big ticket item, so that would be a victory in my book.

Props to your store, the coordinated loss-prevention sounds top notch. Well done."
24,What a great customer! Hope your prospects are okay?
25,"I'm kind of the same way as your store manager. I've grown to the point where I don't think anyone is coming back, because 9 times out of 10 they don't, so I just expect it, but it is a pleasant surprise when they do. I usually try to keep people's things until the end of the day, just to be safe, but after that you're on your own."
26,"""I'm calling the BBB!""

Good luck with that, we aren't part of the BBB."
27,"Heh. Like you'd iron every individual item that way anyway? 

And if it was a thing you did, then surely you'd have industrial presses?

Strange customer, hasn't really thought this thru... "
28,"She knew what she was doing. Some people go to stores searching for those kinds of opportunities (and even make them themselves, like by stealing sales signs and having them reappear magically a few weeks later)."
29,"What did she suggest for you to use instead?

""Why the eff only two cases? We got a lightweight over here!"""
30,"As a victim of ID theft, thank you. It is a hell of a thing to clean up."
31,They... wanted a refund... oh my god.
32,"What an ass. I can understand making a mistake,  but once the staff corrects you,  leave it at that.  There was no need to get management,  nor corporate office, involved. "
33,Haha clearly she is someone who doesn't actually listen to what you're saying because that's just crazy!! 
34,That was pretty awesome. :) I hate those tickling coughs where just a slight inhale makes you nearly hack up a lung. Blehhhh.
35,At least he was polite. 
36,"Jealous your store has radios for this sort of situation! I really wish my store had headsets just for that.

These people left knowing your store is on top of things, so you left a good impression.  &gt;:)"
37,"Between this and her always coming to you for her bagels, she must have liked you. Weird ways of showing it but she liked you. "
38,The hero everyone needs.
39,Best water I ever had.
40,"I understand his panicking about losing his money, but not his taking it out on you. I feel terrible for that woman--broke, with children to feed, and a husband prone to fits of rage. Ugh."
41,&gt; manglement
42,Tell her you work with Batman at night so you are doing good.
43,***Slaughters them all with a single piece of macaroni***
44,[removed]
45,"Yeah, I would have escorted that customer out my store immediately and refused any purchases. "
46,"To be fair, most of the companies that make the outdoor gear (like Patagonia) will return/replace anything that doesn't fit right or falls apart. But this has to be done through the manufacturer, not the store. I have had plenty of hiking gear replaced for free from Patagonia and North Face because it was faulty or ill fitting. "
47,and the BBB is a toothless organization by all standards... 
48,"At least they didn't respond with just a ""yes"". "
49,"[](/flutterroll-in """")&gt;""Well, I know that's a lie"".  

You're right. I guess you are too clever for me. They should both be the higher price, but we had to discount the lighter one because most people have too much fashion sense to buy it otherwise."
50,"Wow. Seriously, this guy wasn't in his right mind. No one keeps a receipt that long."
51,"One of my favourite ways to respond to this goes something like this:

""When you signed up, it was in the terms and we offered you the service on the condition that you agreed to that term. Are you now saying you're reneging on that agreement? Are you saying that you never had any intention to fulfil your part of the agreement you made with us?""

I find that shuts people down, because they won't admit that, they can only complain that the term is unreasonable - but then you can repeat yourself that they agreed to it before and asking if they're reneging. "
52,"Aw no I hope i-

*gets hit by the old guy*"
53,The most frustrating part of this story is the coworker not sharing the tip. 
54,She'll probably just return the outer one and have two free suitcases.
55,"Well...
At least she wasn't a native English speaker.

If she was, then you'd have something to be concerned about."

57,"I think the proper medical term is ""brain fart"". "
58,Those magnet keys are surprisingly cheap and easy to get for something that's only used legitimately by store security.
59,"&gt;Customer: ....well how am I supposed to know that?!

Me, *slowly*: ... Have you, ever, bought shoes before? Like, in your life?"
60,[removed]
61,"""Brand-X! Brand-X!
