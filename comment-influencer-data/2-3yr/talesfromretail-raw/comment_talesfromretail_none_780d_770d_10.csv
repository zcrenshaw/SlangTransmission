0,"&gt;ME: Unfortunately no, ma'am. We exclusively employ slow people.

You gem, you."
1,"&gt; I laugh, he laugh

...the cake laugh, we smashed the cake."
2,"Next time you see her, ask for the vendor ID and say you need records for audit purposes."
3,I thought she kidnapped a kid or something!
4,They never realize that if they're nice we will usually try our best to help them out another way. So when I get an angry customer I usually just say there isn't anything I can do. 
5,The fact that the $5 was still on the ground in a public place is amazing. 
6,Customers always wants to get something on sale or free. Wonder where he got Carl from though.
7,She wasn't actually offended. She saw an opportunity for $$compensation$$
8,"&gt;Management says I'm not allowed to help customers after 10 due to an incident about a week ago.

I love when stories like this have such a satisfying ending. What was her response after you told her that? "
9,"I go so far as to leave some of my items on the shelf, and the lazy staff never even notice. I should get a refund."
10,"You're nice and I'm glad what went around came around.

Reminds me of one time at the dog wash. Early in the day, a woman paid for her dog plus the price of the next dog to come in, just because. That was sweet of her, but the funny thing to me is it took until the last customer of the day to use up the credit because everyone kept paying it forward when we tried to tell them their bath was free. Sometimes the public is all right."
11,"I think he was hoping if he threw a generic enough name out I would believe him

Edit: sorry to any Carl's out there"
12,"If a customer ever said ""you're lucky I don't hit you"" to me, I can assure you that my response would definitely include the words ""jail &amp; assault"".  And furthermore your management at that store absolutely SUCKS if they allow such customers to continue shopping there and not ban them from the store."
13,I'm not an idiot he says. I find that hard to believe sir.
14,"My party and I walked into a tavern. The bar tender asked 'Why do you carry your swords inside here?' I looked him dead in the eyes and said, 'Mimics.' The bar tender laughed. I laughed. My party laughed. The table laughed. We killed the table. It was a good night."
15,"I know I shouldn't be, but I'm always amazed at the attitude customers will give me when they say they are tax exempt &amp; I ask them for their sales tax ID number.  Like I'm supposed to just believe you and leave it at that, no questions asked, and I'm a terrible person for not trusting them.   "
16,"Exactly this 

Mom starts barking at me to find something and she's giving me orders rather than requests? I'm going to go into the back, open my locker and grab my phone, reply to a text, get a swig of water, and then come out and say ""whoops nope sorry"".

Sweet old lady that can barely walk without a walker, wanting to get a nice pair of flats for her grandson's wedding? I will personally walk her around the store so she can break them in herself. "
17,"Her slowing down made me imagine that my response would be Dory's wale impression. ""NnnoooOOoo I aaam sssOOrrryyyy. Weee ddooo nnnnOoot caaaarrryyyyy ooooovvveerrr sssssiiiize thrrrreeeeee XL"""
18,"CFB: Okay, I'm going to explain this slowly again, you don't seem to get it. I need, four XL and five XL to fit me and my husband.

Okay, I definitely thought this was going to be a lightbulb moment where it turned out they actually wanted four female XL shirts and five male XL shirts. "
19,"She basically scoffed and walked away, looking pissed. It was pretty great, honestly."
20,Classic shoplifting trick.  Glad she got caught.
21,"Probably. But if thats what he was hoping Joe, John, Mike or Matt would have been better. 30+ years on this earth and Ive literally met maybe 10 carls but dozens of matts, mikes, joes, and johns."
22,"My record ""pay it forward"" chain was 31 customers long. By that point I was so used to the kindness that I was mildly offended by the person who broke the chain."
23,This store I'm filling in at today is pretty quiet. If it was my main store it wouldn't last 30 seconds
24,"They broke expensive merch, couldn't the cops be called?"
25,Also where I thought this was going. Glad I was wrong.
26,"Honestly, it would have been perfect if OP offered up an application after saying that."
27,Lmao a blank piece of paper has endless usefulness 
28,"You know, I've actually never thought about it that way. You're probably right. Clearly that didn't work. I wonder if she tried threatening to sue or something. I never bothered to follow up or ask more questions. I was just happy to not get fired."
29,"I'm remind of Tywin Lannister's saying ""any man who must say ""I am the king"" is no true king.

Adapted to this situation: Any many who must say "" I am not an idiot"" is a true idiot."
30,"Your title told us it was a story about accidentally offending a disabled person, but I assumed her son had no feet and she was offended that you were offering to help them find shoes."
31,You actually apologized for not knowing instinctively that she's a vendor? You have waaaaayyyy more patience than I do.
32,Oh he bought it... I even had the nerve to ask if he wanted to pay extra for the AppleCare
33,"Well obviously the amount of her stupidity caused a gravitational pull which attracted other smaller idiots into her orbit. 

Seriously tho, it's always seemed to me that people like that always seem to attract other mindless drones."
34,"Excellent.   Enjoy your walk, ladies!"
35,Mistakes happen and more people need to realize that. It's nice when a person is understanding.
36,Excellent representation of Dory. I can *hear* Ellen DeGeneres saying that.
37,"My go to was to ignore them,no matter how many people were in line behind them. I had to hit total to enable the card swipe machine, so people would just swipe and swipe and swipe while talking on their phones and ignoring me. I would wait, looking at them but not doing anything about it. Eventually they'd look up all confused and angry, and I'd say, ""oh, your total is $57.13, I didn't want to interrupt you."""
38,"Omg, barking orders is the worst! If you do the little finger wagging motion and say ""come over here and help me!"" you're gonna get ""sorry ma'am, I'm a cashier so I can't leave my till unattended"". If you simply ask if I can help with [insert problem/question here], I'll call a store associate over and make sure you get the help you need. "
39,"""Are you insinuating that I am stupid?""

I'm not sure why she bothered to ask, she already proved she's stupid."
40,"TL;DR

Old gentleman has a return, I say no and cripple him, he shakes my hand."
41,"Ugh I always hate people like this. The last store I worked at had a candy display that leaned over the belt so stuff could sometimes get stuck which I'd always double check. But then sometimes people would leave all the way on the back where it's non moving and then stare at their phone the whole time, while I'd have to try and ask them to grab it and move it onto the belt. 

I'd get tons of eye rolls like "" oh why can't you just do it"" 

Yes let me just try and reach all the way back there I'm totally not the one with short arms who already has a strange angle to work at. "
42,"I don't even come into the grocery store, but the lazy and incompetent staff have the audacity not to know what I want and bring it to my house. They just lost a customer. "
43,"Good guy OP: doesn't sell sugar bombs or cancer sticks, sends ladies on a healthy walk."
44,"Awww, you didn't even get to say

&gt; But I AM THE MANAGER."
45,"""We exclusively employ slow people""

Kinda sad I didn't think of using this one earlier in my retail career.  Brilliant."
46,"My store is unfortunately quite chicken regarding dealing with nasty customers.  Management HAS to catch the customer(s) doing something wrong in order to ban them.  This is, sadly, company policy. :(

Also, I told the girl to tell management about what happened to her and she basically said that it's in the past. :/"
47,"Let the fantasies of yelling at BL begin! 

1st Fantasy of mine would go something like this: ""Oh You are on the phone. Ok I'll talk louder. YOUR TOTAL IS $67.00!"" 

2nd Fantasy would go something like this ""Hi ma'am. We don't allow people on the phone and to pay at the same time. Please go to the end of the line and wait. NEXT!"" Then proceed to cancel her transaction.  

3rd Fantasy is this  In my most saccharine southern sarcastic tone ""Hi. Oh you are on the phone and you hushed me. Well how about that. Bless your heart. I hope that you and your very important person on the other end are having a wonderful conversation there. You are all rung up and your bags are in your cart now. What is your method of payment? I certainly hope it isn't check because those just take forever don't they? Your total is $67.00 love. Thank you for shopping and I hope you have a great day!""  

In the 3rd fantasy I would just talk endlessly all while being as sweet as I could about it. Clearly meeting all the rules and policies of customer service. All while pissing off the customer. "
48,"I hate when people use one word to try and communicate what they want.

Where I work, on occasion we need to remove cases for locked items...they'll just walk up and hold the item in my face. I stare at them, the item and go back to work until they get the hint and say 'Oh, can you unlock this for me?'

Still a human, regardless of this ID badge. Folk forget that."
49,we always have people who just invite themselves behind the counter to get a better look at stuff. i can't imagine being so invasive 
50,"Put it this way: Your job is on the line. Do you want to be let go or her to be let go?

When you get her vendor and vendor number, call them up and report her. "
51,"A lot of convenience stores in the US are like that. Each section is pretty small, maybe half an aisle, but with multiple aisles you get a pretty wide variety of things. They carry everything from flashdrives to whiskey, condoms, holdiay cards, candy, first aid, makeup, adult diapers, cheap toys, etc. They are basically tiny Walmarts."
52,"You pretty much summed it up in the end. This guy obviously wants to skim money. He wants to point the finger at somebody hoping someone will believe his ludicrous sob story (or lack thereof) and adjust prices. 

The moment he returned AFTER SIGNED LEGAL PAPERWORK, and denies what he said is just wasting yours and everyone else's time. He doesn't want help. He wants a solution regardless of what real world issues occur. 

All in all, sucks to his assmar that he has a bunch of broken problems and doesnt let you tell him what his solutions are. 

I feel for you OP. "
53,"I hope he doesn't use that line forever from now on, except now he adds in, ""well one time it was at some store."" He better be cool about this."
54,"She seems like the kind of person who tries to sue car makers and businesses because the doors can't accommodate her, well, everything."
55,"No, it's only financially beneficial for the person at the end. Everyone else goes away feeling a little bit happier because someone was nice to them and they were nice to another person. It's a totally unnecessary exercise in politeness but, like smiling at strangers when you pass them in the street, it makes everyone involved feel better."
56,"When I used to work retail. Some jack hole thought it was a good idea to extend the counter for the express lanes (by adding a cooler than had a counter on top). Now not a bad idea. But this extra space was not a belt. I'd have to ask customers to push their items forward. Which would result in an angry huff &amp; puff.   

Yes because I have arms that can double their length and magically reach that. \*insert eyeroll*   

I was a jerk at that job and sometimes went around the entire till, pushed the items forward from behind the customer, and returned to my spot. This also angered the stupid.   

Seriously you couldn't win. I am so glad I don't work retail anymore. "
57,"&gt; I was about to offer her two 25lbs bags of a higher quality seed

This made me laugh for all the wrong reasons."
58,"&gt; They came with a plastic cover over the actual blade part to protect them. He had left that on.

I can honestly admit I did this. Admittedly, the blades replaced were so bad that even then it was a massive improvement, and it was my first time changing blades myself. I noticed the second time I had to use my wipers when the plastic started coming off and felt like such a dumbass removing the plastic in a parking lot in the rain."
59,ur manager should look into getting spinal reconstruction surgery
60,How big is this convenience store that it has makeup stuff and a school supply isle?! 
61,But what if she gave birth to four vodka bottle shaped babies?
