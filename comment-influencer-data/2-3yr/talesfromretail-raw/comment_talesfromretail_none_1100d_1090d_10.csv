0,I wonder what she told then to make them arrive so quickly!
1,"""Why did I get a parking ticket? It says Parking right here.""

""Yes sir, right after the word 'No.' It says 'No Parking.'""

""Man, that's false advertising..."""
2,"Also in a thrift store, much like every other store, you are not obligated to buy *anything*."
3,They wanted to see what crazy looks like in person
4,"""SIX! THAT SUMBITCH OVER THERE GAVE ME SEVEN NUGGETS, AND NOW I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE IS THE WRONG NUGGET BECAUSE THAT IDIOT PUT THEM ALL IN THE SAME BOX!""

*edit: thanks for the gold stranger, but that doesn't solve my nugget situation!*"
5,It's really common for people to use their children to shoplift for them. It just creates a long line of shoplifters which will never end.
6,"""Why can't you just support military spouses, we have the hardest job in the army.""

Ma'am, ""spouse"" is not a rank in the army."
7,"Wow, really ballsy of him to say that you *will* stay an extra hour and a half for him. I would have probably hung up at that point, no offense, just because he had no intention of actually coming in before 5 PM and because of that, he couldn't be considered a customer."
8,"Wait, did he actually bring in an old tag from last year to scan?

If so, that's... different."
9,"According to Suits, it's fraud!"
10,"&gt;clearly stated on the schedule on the glass door

which means something less than nothing to a customer who is in process of losing their mind until you open at 09:00:58"
11,"Given the time of year, my first glimpse of the title read, in my mind, as ""9/11: She went for it"".  I was expecting a MUCH different story."
12,"That might actually be it, just checking to make sure someone who sounds maybe nuts wasn't nuts enough to be a real problem."
13,That floor should have offered them free shoes.
14,"When I dispatched, we had a code for crazy that we used when the complaint was absurd and it seemed that the person calling was disoriented or made no sense... officers usually got to those calls quickly because they knew, nine out of ten times,  it was a quick resolution call that added activity to their daily log (and potentially shielded them from having to take a less desirable call) and wouldn't require any action or paperwork."
15,"My mother never made me steal but she made me open seales packages to check how things looked. Packs of lingerie/socks, electronics,perfumes, lotions...pretty much anything that shouldn't be opened. It was really embarrassing and when we got caught she would act like I was just a naughty kid. :("
16,"That's pretty much how it went! I've been off that job for just over a month now. My memory on it isn't as sharp anymore, but my stories always seem to make the ordeal much tamer than it actually was. She was really rude and exasperated, and although I did offer every possible solution short of putting her puny $2 order in front of $85 orders, I was just done at the end. No, I am not going to help you. 

The other customer though, the guy I mentioned at the end, he had me shaking with anger. He was giving me (from the very start) a condescending attitude while trying to explain his uncomplicated order to me as if I were too dumb to understand it. I finally just cut him the fuck off mid-sentence ""Look, you're going to stop talking right now, and start treating me a goddamn human, cause that's what I am."" He tried to start on me but I wasn't having it. I just started arguing with him, it was my last day, fuck it. 

""Go get a manager. I dare you.""

(or something along those lines) was the last thing I said to him. 

Edit: Woah was not expecting gold off this! Glad I could make someone's day with my last-day-on-the-job tale!"
17,"My last day in a call center 
""I don't think you even care, I'll have your job over this!""
Me-ma'am, you're right, I don't care. Myself and 300 other people are out of a job in 20 minutes because  [cell phone company] decided to go with cheaper workers with less training, I care more about the people here about to be jobless with rent due than I do about your 4 dropped calls last month."" 

She sputtered, I hung up, and took one last call.  

Oh and the new call center got a week of training and 6.50 an hour to our month of training and 9.50 an hour.  Was the second contract that decided we were too expensive and cutting costs for customer service was a really good idea. "
18,He did. Not only is it strange but bizarre that he got agitated about the price not reflecting what was advertised. The whole thing was pretty bizarre by retail standards. 
19,"Considering this myself, regardless of what she said when she called, with the store being so close to the center of town, these small town cops are always parked somewhere in the square and would only need 2 minutes max to show up as long as they didn't have some other customer to defend. "
20,"You aren't? My God, this could've saved my hundreds of bucks and dozens of broken coffee makers! "
21,Helicopter parent evolved into: Helicopter wife!
22,"Main reason that I didn't hang up just then was because my supervisor was standing near me and I was still technically on the clock. I was mostly just trying to show her that ""hey I gave it my best shot"" sorta thing."
23,"I'm so sorry to hear that your husband is deployed to California. If he were here I would gladly shake his hand, thank him for his service, and give him a break on the price.

You however are a bitch who is using his service for your own superficial and personal gain. If I could I would slap you silly, toss you out on your ass, and ban you from this store for life.

Have a nice day. :)"
24,"People do this all the time to me when I am stocking beer. I ask if they need anything, they say no, and then they go ask a male coworker to help them find a beer. It is the best feeling in the world when the male coworker turns to ask me where something is or how many types of X style beer we have. "
25,"I used to work at a bridal store. A bride came in to get her gown hemmed and started crying because the seamstress was ""poking holes"" in the dress. With pins."
26,"&gt; LM: Well it doesn't matter because I'm coming at 6:20 and you're going to help me.

Soo... LM is Oprah Winfrey?"
27,How is she supposed to write a police report when somebody stole her ABC? 
28,"We have a 10-89 on the 225.

I'd go, but I'm currently resolving another issue! Yes ma'am, how many nuggets were supposed to be in your order?"
29,"&gt;No, you're going to stay open until 6:20.

Welp, that's how you get sales associates to do the absolute bare minimum required to help you even if you do show up the next day.

A woman once came up to me to ask me about a pair of shorts in her son's size, and when I told her we were sold out she said ""Well then you need to call another store and find them.""

I called one store, but only because that's part of my job. Had she asked me more kindly (or really, even asked me at all instead of demanding), I would have called every store in the area to do the item check.

Some customers really need to learn the phrase, ""You catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar."""
30,"It's worse than that. Her ARMY husband was deployed to a MARINE base in California, Afghanistan."
31,"A thief stealing a bike lock, I guess they don't like it when people steal from them. "
32,"After she said that, my immediate impulse was to drop an f bomb on her. If it happened now, I'm not sure I could avoid the temptation to do. I had more restraint back then. And more fucks to give, I guess."
33,"""Why are they making you work on Labor Day?""

""Because you're here asking me that question."""
34,Does....does that lady even know what the definition of a thrift store is?
35,"Yup, but still faster than 70 yr old ladies writing checks. "
36,"What, you don't have a separate phone for payments? What are you going to do when you need to pay while you're talking?"
37,"Don't forget to amp it up on your last day if you get the chance.
""I want to speak to a manager!""
""Yeah, well I don't give a fuck.""
And post reactions!"
38,"It is against the law to act as a lawyer if you aren't, depending on the specifics of the situation. It falls under Unauthorized Practice of Law laws.

Just a note. So if he gave legal advice to his son while claiming to be a lawyer while he wasn't, that actually was illegal."
39,I hate that this sounds so absolutely believable as something someone would call to complain about.
40,That floor needs to be fired immediately!
41,"&gt;$Me: Remind me never to hire you as a lawyer, if you're under the impression you could successfully sue someone over the fundamental nature of cables.

Well said!  You shut him down in a relatively polite way while still making it clear he was being an idiot."
42,"&gt; I've had hundreds of people threaten to sue, not a single one has.

The former owner of my business would always hand them a business card and say, ""Don't spell my name wrong."" Genius."
43,"What? A positive story that warms the veins of my heart to just above freezing? And it involves a child, that seems to have been taught well? The blasphemy!!

Mods! We need a mod here! This can't be allowed. /s"
44,"God damn,  if theyd asked for a discount cause the shoe had glass on it... "
45,"&gt;Outraged: Well fine! I'm never shopping here again!

Why is it they never keep this promise??"
46,"I sell vibrators, and, as a man, it can occasionally be challenging to earn trust with the customers.  A few times something interesting has happened: a woman will come into the store and straight to the vibes.  I'll let her browse for a couple of minutes before asking her if she has any questions.  She'll dismissively say ""no.""  Moments later a more laid back woman will come into the store and ask me about every single vibrator in the store.  I'll start detailing the minutiae of vibrator shopping, and the first woman will perk out and come over to listen in.  I like changing people's minds about me.  That's one of the more satisfying parts of the job."
47,"See I'm the kind of person that would keep an identical, empty cup under the counter just so I could always tell her it was empty. It stops being nice when you take advantage."
48,According to suits you don't need a degree or to go to law school either!
49,"Reminds me of the time I went to a gig and overheard a conversation on the merch stand:

&gt; Customer: ""So how big is the medium size?""

I personally took this to mean similar to your post; asking how they sized according to other brands. His response, without skipping a beat and giving zero fucks:

&gt; Merch Guy: ""They're a bit bigger than the small and a bit smaller than the large."""
50,"&gt;[Unsurprising country of origin]

I want to be unsurprised.  "
51,"Yup.

""Hey Sheriff, Mr. Johnson over at the gas station says somebody just stole a bunch of beer from his store!""

""It's ten in the morning -- OK, send a unit out to Cletus' house before he drinks all of it.""

Brings whole new meaning to ""The usual suspects."""
52,"You should have sold him a copy of NBA 2K16, it's the same thing."
53,"&gt;Well, don't expect me to find any for you, I don't know when they'll be restocked. :P

Can't you just check in the back? I bet you'd have more in the back. The other location has plenty of fucks, can't you just call corporate and get more in? I want to speak to the manager.


"
54,Not with that attitude. 
55,"Only if he gives me 200 bucks for it. Otherwise, that's false advertising."
56,"&gt; I've shopped with you guys for years 

Has never been to the store. Ever."
57,"Why didn't your managers call the cops *on her*? And judging from the other comments, this isn't exactly uncommon. Are you in the U.S.?"
58,"I imagine her spouse would be somewhere between mortified and infuriated if he (probably) heard that.

&gt; And more fucks to give, I guess.

Well, don't expect me to find any for you, I don't know when they'll be restocked. :P"
59,Did you notify the police?
60,"Does it mean that I am jaded if this didn't even surprise me that much? It is sad, but my standard for customer intelligence is not very high at this point. "
61,Nice catch!
62,"How does an idiot like that have a big wad o' cash in his pocket?  

I'm guessing he cooks meth..."
63,"I would have said, there will just be a $150, non refundable,  late pick up fee.  Please give me your credit card number to process your order..."
64,"What a nasty woman. I hope your other customers were kinder. 

Also, I hope your health has picked up and you're doing better now. "
65,"You actually don't necessarily have to have ever been to law school. You have to pass the bar, but 4 states allow you to do so without attending law school."
