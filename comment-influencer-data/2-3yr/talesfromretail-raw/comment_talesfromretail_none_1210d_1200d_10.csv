0,"""Hi there. I just used a bathroom in *your* store; I need *you* to wipe my ass for me."""
1,"I've noticed that older people can be either very nice or very mean. They've had an entire lifetime to figure themselves out, so they'll show their true personalities. Glad to read a story with a nice old person. "
2,"I like how £140 worth of stuff would have taken a good while to buy but YOU ringing it up at the till is what's delaying her, clearly. "
3,"Obviously Earl Grey isn't black - it's got grey in the name, so it must be grey tea.  /s"
4,I love when they just open the door and usher Karma right in.
5,"Reminds me of a story my friend told me recently.  Some woman told him that she asked for a refund on a ticket for the local baseball team because...wait for it....THE TEAM LOST and she spent about $70.

How do these people function?"
6,"Right?  ""I'm in a hurry!""  Then shop another time, you dolt.  "
7,"She demanded an answer, and you supplied one. Checks out."
8,My mom once accidentally threw her teeth away at a restaurant. She sent me back in to find them. I was digging through the trash when an employee came to ask what I was looking for. That sweet girl helped me find my mommy's teeth. I never would have expected that from an employee anywhere. 
9,"What. the. hell. 

What is that dude's problem?"
10,"Haha! I once made the mistake of saying something like ""it becomes a lovely deep red colour when you brew it"" and I **could not** convince the customer that it was still black tea. It's not like black tea is a solid black colour when you put it in water ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"
11,Good manager! Give 'em a cookie.[](/cookieninja)
12,[removed]
13,"On the other hand, it's just as annoying when the name of your store correctly implies that we sell that item and you get calls every day asking if we sell that item.
I used to work for a smoke shop with cigar in the name. Think of names like Cigar Palace or Cigar Room. Damn near every day, we'd get a call and I would answer,  
&gt;Me: ""Cigar --------, how can I help you?""  
&gt;Customer: ""Hi, yeah...do you have any cigars?""  
&gt;Me: ""......."""
14,"I hate hate hate those tables.  The shirt I want is always at the bottom, if it's there at all, and it's hard to neatly move a stack of shirts and pull the bottom one out with one hand while you have an armful of other stuff to try on.  And they always put too many shirts in one pile, so it topples over if you breathe on it. And they don't have any on display, so you have to unfold it to see if it's long sleeved, or cropped, or whatever, and then what do you do if you don't want it, you have to re-fold it and put it back, and you can never fold like they do it, and as I said, your arms are full of other stuff.

That's why if there's anybody working the floor, I go up to them and say, ""I'm sorry, I know you're busy, but I'd like to see that shirt and it looks like someone worked hard to set everything up so carefully.  Can you take one out for me? Thanks."""
15,"""Yes, sir. You are *very* chubby."" And give him a stern face. And then just guffaw. ""I was just messing with you! Hahaha! Hilarious! AmIright?"""
16,Retail smugs are one of the best smugs. Glad to see the old bat put in her place.
17,Maybe he didn't want the spicy sushi.
18,I'm sure he figured that if he kept yelling at me I'd eventually give in.
19,"I shall start a lingerie store chain called ""Women's Sexy Underwear Store"". Straight and to the point! Ron Swanson would be proud (Very Good building Co.)"
20,"So much of life depends on how you go about things, this is proof of that. 

I bet if the woman had been knee deep in the trash and explained a few people would have helped because. Demand and nope, nope and nope again."
21,How was the mother not responsible for paying for the pissed on clothes?
22,Sounds like this lady has never seen tea outside of a tea bag before? Crazy old thing probably thought Earl Grey should actually be grey.
23,"""Sir, do you have any more coupons on you? Because I'm afraid I'm going to have to confiscate them. Coupons are a privilege and you don't seem to be able to handle them."""
24,[removed]
25,"Hahaha. That's crazy. ""Just because I say I'm going to buy shoes and I give you money to buy the shoes, doesn't mean I really want to purchase them. How isnt that clear?"""
26,"I used to get that at Blockbuster (I assume names of now defunct businesses won't break rules).

People would go to the grocery store first, and then complain about ice-cream melting in the car when they waited in line... Why not just, you know. get the groceries last? Your DVD rental isn't going to melt."
27,"It's only one or the other, NEVER in between. "
28,"That ranks right up there with ""But I live in (other municipality) so I should get to pay the lower tax rate."""
29,"It's beyond me how working in retail automatically means you're a high school dropout. Is college free and my university is playing an elaborately expensive joke on me? Because they're really putting a deep as hell dent in my financial situation.

Also: YOU SHOULD KNOW YOUR ACTUAL AGE. CLEARLY THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT AND THEREFORE YOUR ACTUAL AGE ISN'T YOUR ACTUAL AGE. HOW DARE YOU. /s"
30,"""Please hold my drink and pour it into my mouth for me, I don't want to look like a *serf*."""
31,They have been enabled at least once by a overly generous return policy.
32,Best ending ever! I hope you also included where the bag was found in that note.
33,"If she didn't want it because of the bag tax, then i guess the bag tax is working?"
34,[removed]
35,"I'm sure he thought himself hilarious, but that was a bit of a mean trick to play. "
36,Honestly I think my manager was just in shock. She hadn't been a manager long and she probably didn't think about that. 
37,This is the worst free pie I have ever nearly finished!
38,People like this make my day.   I once had someone actually hang up their cellphone when they got to the front of the line one day.   I was in a good mood the rest of my shift.
39,[removed]
40,Few quicker ways to get fired are known to man 
41,"""Ma'am, this is a clothes store, not a clothes library.""

I mean, that's just incredible. Let me recap, have I got this right? 

* She expects you to take something back without a receipt 
* Said item is then sopping wet and clearly used and unsaleable 
* After getting a refund she wants to have the garment back til she replaces it

Wow. That's just... I'm not sure what world she lives in. 

I'm sorry that your store goes so nuts about pleasing the customer, it's a good thing most of the time but people like this really do abuse the system, whether that's deliberate or whether she's just a bit deluded about how it works! "
42,"&gt; Tea. Earl grey. Not black. 

&gt; The specified item is not available for replication."
43,Yeah... No. Police should have been involved from the second he held you against your will.
44,"""I even added extra briquettes to the water and it tasted nothing like the restaurant we usually go to and they charboil their steaks."""
45,"Barely related, but I remember once in high school a bully was making fun of me for something (honestly I learned not to pay attention) when he took off his hat and bowed.  I don't know the point he was trying to make, but the bag of weed he had stashed under his hat fell off his head in front of the teacher."
46,"This forum is *littered* with tales of people pitching a fit about showing ID. I just don't get it. If you live somewhere that it's common to be asked for ID, then just freaking carry it with you and take it out for a second so the cashier can see it.

Are we still so childish that we get offended if a retail worker doesn't acknowledge that we're Big Kids now? Good grief."
47,"You are perfectly correct, and you handled it perfectly.

I've run a small retail business for the last five years and I've had my fair share of guests come in ready for a fight when asking for returns. All I did was stay calm and it's so disarming for them because all their friends get them all riled up for no reason (though it seems you just had a curmudgeon in your case)."
48,"If only they had fallen into a puddle of mud, or a parking-lot oil-spill...

&gt;""I need to return these, since the incompetent bagger didn't double bag this!""

You mean, the one who offered to double bag, but whom you rudely snatched the bag from and then insulted?

&gt;""whatever, YOU need to fix this!""

I'm sorry mam, we can't accept a return on well-used clothes."
49,"My son is 7 and REALLY into Minecraft. When the Microsoft Glass VR headset was demoed with Minecraft, he and I watched the video together a few times. He asked if we could get them when they came out. A few months later, they announced that they would be priced at $3000. That is a little out of my price range. 

So I told him that it was unlikely that we would get them. He didn't get upset. He said, ""That's okay. You don't have to buy them. I'll just put them on my Christmas list and Santa will bring them.""

Not wanting him to be disappointed, I explained that Santa can't make the VR glasses because Microsoft owns the copyright and probably wouldn't license them to Santa."
50,"Customers' train of thought is so interesting. ""I DID NOT TAKE CARE OF MY PERSONAL BELONGINGS BUT I WAS IN YOUR STORE SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR NOT MONITORING ME LIKE A CHILD."" OK lady. Try again."
51,"Why can't this be the rule? The nicer you are the more we can do for you, that would be way nicer then the norm."
52,Writing Prompt: There is a secret war going on in our society between the nice old people and the mean old people. Think Man in Black with scooters. 
53,"Earl grey, clearly, is it's own unique classification of tea. I mean, that's why it's called earl *grey?* Duh!

...Seriously though, she's probably never heard of her preferred tea being associated under a color, so you blew her mind in a way she wasn't ready to handle. And because she's a terrible person, rather than just saying 'oh, I never knew that!' and moving on, she had to be *right* and pitch a fit instead. Which left you scolded.. and her tealess."
54,Pity no cops were nearby to ticket her for littering...
55,"These are such great people. Usually nasty old customer like that mom would avoid asking me for help, go to an older associate and get no help from them. Then that older associate brings them over to me and I'm there smug as all hell about it. "
56,"Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.
 
"
57,"&gt;Won't see me coming back anytime soon!  

Good!"
58,"This is the truth, I feel like the tables are secretly meant to make the customers feel bad about their folding skills or to make sure there's always work for the poor employees"
59,"I love it when people blame us for them misplacing their things. A lady came in today asking if we had found her Yeti thermos in one of our carts (it's like a $40 thermos that had a surge of popularity and lots of people bought them). I take a lot of effort to ask around, look in the carts, etc. And come back about 5 minutes later and report that unfortunately, it hasn't turned up, but we can take down her name and number and call her if it does. She complains, ""No, someone probably just stole it. It might have been your bagger, I saw him getting carts. There's no way he didn't see it.""

I'm a little startled, but send her off with ""good luck, have a nice day.""

She comes back a few minutes later, and says ""find my cup yet?"" I tell her unfortunately, no, it hasn't turned up. So she starts placing her groceries on the counter and tells me she needs to return it all, about $40 worth of groceries, so ""you all can pay to replace my cup."""
60,"I'm a flight attendant, and recently a man stood up in the aisle when the plane was still moving towards the gate. I picked up the phone to make a PA to tell him to sit down, and right as I did the captain slammed on the parking brake and THE GUY FELL. It took everything in me not to cheer (he was fine). "
61,"It peeves me when people expect things to last forever.

Things get worn down especially when not properly taken care of.

I know a few online sellers that have been selling jewelry for years. They occasionally come up to our board with stories like ""customer wanted a refund on broken necklace chain. They said they wore it every day for the past 4 years and it broke and wanted a refund for a faulty necklace chain"" Some of them would refund, some of them wouldn't. 

If the bike rusted they left it outside in the elements. We have a bike in our garage that's been sitting for years and the only thing wrong with it is a flat tire. "
62,"I get this. 
Boss: Why haven't you done &lt;low to mid priority task&gt;? 
Me: Because I have &lt;huge list of high priority tasks&gt; to do first, I haven't got time. 
Boss: You should *make* time. 
Me: ...... that's not how time works.."
63,Have to admit I wonder how much merchandise wandered out the door in the confusion.. sounds like one of those 'too good to be the work of amateurs' kinds of things..
64,I used to tell customers that it was called the Orange Box store Exercise Program.  But only if I was walking with them to find the product or if they comment on how much the employees must walk each day.
65,"The only way this could have ended better is if the sexy underwear store employee also shared a story about crazy lady, you fell in love, got married, and had kids.

And who is the minister at your kids wedding? Bam! Crazy lady!"
66,"Stupid kid, doesn't he know that you always keep your stash in the Fallout case!?! Nobody in their right mind would trade Fallout because of replay value alone..."
67,"&gt; still swearing about how he's tired of having to deal with stupid people all the time.

That's the problem with being stupid.  You have to deal with a stupid person literally *all* the time."
