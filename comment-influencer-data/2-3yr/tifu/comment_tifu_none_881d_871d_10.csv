Get his lawyer to obtain the CCTV footage from the store. Your stepdaughter running and jumping into your arms proves your not a stranger. It will also prove that she pushed you into the shelves.
"Can't wait to see pt. 2 ""TIFU by putting my very personal story on Reddit verifying for my whole company that I pissed on myself in front of the CEO."""
Was going to say this as well. And do it SOON. CCTV tapes are often written over quickly. 
Why does the security guard have to go to the front stand to see if they have spaghetti? What movie theater has spaghetti?
"&gt;All I know is that she is absolutely going to be telling her lawyer about this. 

Maybe you should tell your boyfriend's lawyer about her pinning you to a shelf and screaming at you? "
"For a moment there, I thought you were gonna say that your mom named your dick ""teeny blonde"". 

That would have made this post so much better. "
What cinema has guards that walk around?! 
And then spent all weekend smoking weed and playing video games.
Did you write this TIFU on your own?  Or is this actually your wife writing to cover her tracks?

"Me reading this: ""Lol what, Shrek 2 wasn't released 13 years ago""

*checks google*

Me after: ""Jesus I'm fucking old"""
It's important to note that this wasn't an impulse FU. This was premeditated and researched and you still fucked up quite spectacularly. I'm a little impressed. 
Whats your spaghetti policy here?
"Can't wait to read the TIFU in 10 years ""obligatory this happened 10 years ago but took viagra thinking it was my flintstone vitamin, rager all day"""
"Sad story, when I was a senior in high school there was a huge fiasco because someone on the yearbook team put a placeholder on a girls name that they were going to come back and fix later, the placeholder was fat pig... Well the placeholder never got corrected and they printed hundreds of these yearbooks that all said this poor girls name was fat pig. Once people noticed the girls parents were threatening to sue the school. The school decided to recall all of the yearbooks to cut that page out and glue in a corrected one. They made everyone return the year books and if you didn't they wouldn't give you your diploma, or if you weren't a senior they put a hold on your next years schedule. It was a clusterfuck all because some kid thought they were funny"
"Actually it's most likely that the cold water in contact with the hot lightbulb caused it to shatter- not the electricity! I almost did the same thing once, but my mum caught me haha "
I'm very surprised you didn't get charged for the helicopter search! I have heard some horror stories and a few thousand dollar bill on top of that would have /totally/ sealed the deal.
"I don't take any chances except for this huge chance that I'm now taking. No one else uses reddit ever, right? "
Should have taken off those piss riddled clothes n presented naked. It would've showed confidence n u wouldnt smell pissy
"You did the right thing, and she did not. You should do three things right away:

1. Write all of this down again in a proper memo or Affidavit. Memory becomes fuzzy with time and contemporaneous accounts can appear more credible;

2. See if there are tapes, or were witnesses who will write a short memo for you;

3. If your bf's lawyer won't cover this, cop out a couple hundred to see what you can do to avoid a restraining order - that would hurt your bf's case. You may need to proactively speak to the police, or not - but talk to a lawyer.

Don't go after her yourself.

Obviously dont speak to her directly about this without clearing it with the lawyer. Dont post this on facebook. Trash talk is frowned upon in family cases.

You didnt fu today, but did everything right. Good judgement and cool. Good luck."
"It's okay to be a victim of abuse, bro. It's not your fault that your wife beats you. 

No need to fabricate these TIFU stories, we all know how it feels and are here for you if you want to talk about it. 
We will even call police for you when you're ready to admit it and press charges. 

No matter what she says, it's not your fault. You're a victim here, but you will get through this, I promise. "
I remember being twelve.  He was going to have a boner all day anyways.
Blink twice if she's standing behind you. 
"The worst part was that there wasn't enough chemistry to make it kinda funny.

Otherwise it could've been a romcom date where you charm each other while walking through the woods. Wasn't that a Friends episode or something?"
"I thought your wife was going to be confused as to why you had ""hickeys"" everywhere from the paintballs.  Your story is way more entertaining as a FU.  "
but did you beat your high score?
"Just to piggyback off the other comments in case you missed them (bc I didn't see you reply to it), have him do it ASAP so they can get CCTV footage. There's a high possibility it will be overwritten within a day or 2 if it isn't requested. That footage could prove useful when a she-said/she-said inevitably starts. As soon as the ex realizes the actual series of events won't help as much as she thinks, she'll start changing it to say you lured the girl or some nonsense. Get that footage if you can."
"Should have just finished the sandwich, then said ""what sandwich?"" when he came back. No proof, no goddamned way he can kick you out without getting shit on by management. And he'll look like an idiot claiming that you were eating something as ridiculous as a spaghetti sandwich in a movie theater."
"The real question here is how do you sleep all night, bust a nut in the morning, and then don't take a piss until you're already at work? Especially considering when someone's nervous they tend to feel like pissing often. 

I think I might have to call bullshit on this whole thing just based on that.

ALSO, how do your wild piss streaks go *up* and *back*, thereby pissing on your shirt? What is this the god damn Kennedy assasination? Was there a second fucking shooter here or what?"
"Are they? In my place (completely different country, but hey) we hold on to tapes for 9 months. Quality ain't great, but still."
"She said it was because of A Series Of Unfortunate Events. One of them must have loved the classic movie starring Jim Carrey, while the other hated it."
Most places is something like 24 hours unless  requested. Those systems loop and just record over the oldest thing. Almost nobody archives them.
"I kinda feel sorry for her. Not in this in this particular situation tho, but in general. Think about this: she meets a man, she falls in love with him. He falls in love with her. They have a child, she thinks that they will always be together, but he doesn't. He is with her just because he is not with you OP. He doesn't see her as 'The One' yet she does. All of the sudden someone come along and take him 'the love of her life and the father of her daughter' away from her and destroy everything thing she dreamt of. I am not saying that OP is at fault here, but the husband is. Of course i do not know every little detail and cannot judge based on few paragraphs written on reddit yet I am kinda going through something similar and I am just trying to understand what she is going through and sympathy with her. I hope nobody get hurt in this:)"
"Highly doubt it was an usher. As a former usher, we would know what food we sell but also no one would enforce the food policy at that point. Causes too much of a disturbance for other guests. We only walked in the theater to check picture and sound quality and make sure the exit doors were closed. We used to count people so the managers knew we actually did it and would also look for people filming or doing other sketchy stuff. Maybe it was just the theaters I worked at but ushers were always chill and pretty much didn't care about anything including doing our jobs. "
SomeBODY once told me that Shrek 2 was 13 years old. 
"No idea. 

Counting wasn't really a priority."
"It's not even close to ""most likely"", it's *precisely* what happened."
*farts three times
"This is not for OP per se but for people in a circumstance involving divorce. 

I can't believe how narcissistic and vengeful people get during divorces. As a child of divorced parents, all I could think about the whole time reading this is how this would this impact the child after taking this ""incident"" to lawyers. Unless there are real circumstances that threaten the child's wellbeing like doing illegal shit, being financially/mentally unstable, or having to relocate then bringing in shit like this just adds trauma to the kids life. 

I personally have very little trust in people because everything that I said to my mother (as a child under 6) was taken to court and used against my father. My dad could have been a lot meaner in court but he's not that way. End result, my dad got custody(which was unique for 30 years ago) and I rarely speak to my mother. When I do it's like a distant relative with whom I am forced to converse. 

For those who have kids and are having a custody battle... your child is not a battleground, a tool for vengeance, a trophy, or a bargaining chip. The court may side with you but fuck you if you USE your child in this manner. "
"This is like a multi-level fuckup. First, always close the porn once you're done. Two, don't use a razor on your dick. Three, referring to point 2, don't use something like shaving cream that can obscure the view of your dick while shaving. Four, actually doing what the song says.  "
"Is anyone else sick of this ""descriptive"" writing style for TIFU?

It's like a classroom where everyone is trying to be the funny kid... not everyone can be funny."
Think they're called ushers.
I can't speak for all states in the US but the one in which I live and work (in a public k-12 high school) cannot withhold a diploma from a student for any reason other than failure to meet the academic standard to graduate... They _can_ and do keep students from walking in the graduation ceremony but they can NOT withhold a diploma.

"My team (3 folks including myself) fucked up in our yearbook class by forgetting to include the board of educators and the superintendent. 
I wasn't involved in that page (most of my stuff was covering extracurricular classes and staff, as well as adding trivia/questionnaires to fill in empty spots) but all of  us were responsible for double checking our work. 

The yearbook gets published and the exclusion becomes a semi-big deal. 

The teacher for the yearbook also taught the journalism class/lead the school newspaper. 
The school had censored a student because their article put a bad light on the administration. 
The next school paper had a theme about censorship. 
Basically after a lot of back and forth, this teacher was not in a position to antagonize the school board. 

My team forgetting to put their pictures in was seen as deliberate and we all wrote letters of apology to explain our mistake. 

I drew stick figure versions of them in every yearbook I signed (if the space was available).

Your boyfriends lawyer would like the camera footage too. Her physically attacking you in front of their daughter is pretty scary. If I saw a lady talking to my child in the store my first reaction wouldn't be to assault her. I think she knew who you were and used that as an excuse to manhandle you.

In all seriousness though I'm glad the people in your area are taking it seriously. Better to be slightly inconvenienced when it isn't happening than ignored when it is. Makes for great stories too!

"My daughter just finished a one-month charity stint in Fiji. Ants are freaking EVERYWHERE. She'd wake up daily with 30+ dead ants on her bed. They'd shake the sheets out, broom them together and dispose nearly daily.

Even worse, she drank tea. From the time she'd put the pot on the stove to the time it brewed, cooled and found its way into her cup, another ant or two would be in there. 

Naturally she grossed out. Re-brewed tea. That was on day one. By day ten, she would pick them out of her tea, and drink it anyway. By day twenty, she's like ""Fuck it. Free protein."" Which could almost be Fiji's advertising slogan.

In fairness this was on the ""non-touristy"" side of the island; the ants are mostly small black ants that don't hurt people or pets. But boy oh boy do they have the reproduction thing down solid."
"Am a nurse now, in triage someone told me they were having stomach issues.

"One time when my daughter was little she was pony-riding on my back in the living room. I could feel her start to slide off so I reached back to catch her and in the process hit her in the forehead with my elbow. Really hard. A huge welt immediately rose on her forehead, so my wife and I jumped in the car with her and headed for the ER. As we sat in the very crowded waiting room, holding ice on my daughter's head, my wife unthinkingly said to her, ""Do you forgive Daddy?"" 

We were split up and interviewed separately. LUCKILY they eventually believed what happened. This is the same wife who once told a TSA agent to be careful opening her tightly packed suitcase because, ""It might explode.""

T'was a decision made after days of being stoned.  Chance-taking risk assessment was perhaps a tad impaired.
"My highschool yearbook had a section called ""last will and testament"" in which we were supposed to basically write a list of qualities we wanted to leave behind to the underclassmen.

"I don't get how this could happen  due to a ""baking soda stomach"". Your stomach is acidic and sure knocking back vinegar might make you want to vomit but not due to that kind of a reacrion.

"It's happened to me before. If you fap and don't piss for awhile sometimes it will take some pressure before it comes out, or sometimes it will, as in OP's case, come out in small angled streams.

I had an assault charge brought on someone (to stave off the bullying that was happening). It was wonderful.

I was super hyped all week for this, and my presentation was spot on.

So 10-7 minutes before I go in the board room I decide to take a piss. I hadn't pissed all day because I was so excited and healthily nervous, double checking everything and such.

"Gonna jump in here and maybe clarify - 

SAR works very similar to other emergency services such as police and fire rescue. House burning down? The fire department won't bill you for their time and effort. Need to call the police? No problem, you won't get billed. 

Most SAR cases are due to things beyond our control(for the most part). Getting lost in the woods is ok. It happens. Purposefully getting lost in the woods, however, is different. Unless their is negligent or reckless actions that majorly contribute to the need for SAR, you won't be billed. 

With that in mind, happy exploring!"
Better luck next time!
"I was waiting for a table in a nice Italian restaurant with my family and 3-yr. old son.  In front of us is a couple in their 40s and the woman was strikingly beautiful.   She was wearing a skin-tight dress and had a magnificent posterior.  Even though I was with my wife and parents, I would sneak a peek whenever it was safe.  Suddenly, she whips around and glares at me.  We look down and my son was rubbing her ass in a circular motion.  He looks up at us, smiles, and says, ""It feels NICE.""  Had a good laugh."

Because he made it up?

This human bean gets it.
I thought she was going to see he was on meetup.com and accuse him of cheating. 
Well looks like you are about to be expelled! Hope it was worth it!

Even at point blank range he'll miss the tube. He can't even hit a fucking urinal.
I'm just surprised they actually considered you were being abused

"I think that may be the hardest part for the mom. The fear of the ""happy family"" (ex-husband, ex-husbands new girl friend whom he loved during their entire marriage, and her child). I don't agree with her pushing OP, but I honestly don't think that makes her a bad person."
What caused you to faint? Why do you need an op?

Butt touching is so essential to a healthy marriage. 
"Having been through a custody battle, I will say this. Judges have zero fucs to give about stupid little shit like this. They want facts, like how much time is spent with the child, if there is any abuse, if child support is being paid. The stupid petty bullshit that everyone collects, and thinks is their trump card, most likely isn't shit in the eyes of the judge. This incident won't mean anything to a judge. My advice, most states have a minimum custody law, every time she breaks it and not allows his visitation, log it, file a custodial interference with the police. THAT will matter in the eyes of the judge. The absolute worst thing you can do is let that slide. Time and relationship with the child is probably the MOST important. "
