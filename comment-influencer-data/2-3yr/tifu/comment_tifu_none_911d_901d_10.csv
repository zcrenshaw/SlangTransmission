Get out there and face it. It will only be bad if you act cowardly and try to hide from it.  Stand up straight and look everyone in the eye.
The next person in line for OP's job sat there coldly watching him die.
When you mentioned knives and sex toys in the same sentence I got really scared.

"Go to court (if you have time) on your court date and wait to discuss it with the court solicitor. If you have a clean record they might be willing to wave the ticket fees if you get everything fixed by a certain date. Tail lights can usually be a fix-it-ticket (not sure if that's what you got) and license expiration ticket fee will be waived if you get it taken care of, as does the expired tag. WHAT ACTUALLY LOOKS BEST, is to fix it all before going to court, then say you have it all taken care of (bring proof for each) and they might just throw it all out and you may not have to pay anything. Just some advice. IANAL. "
"Or in the cases of your boss' boss, his one remaining good eye."

Anyhow, I hope you still get your promotion dude :)"
It worked! Pretty fast as well! Now I just have to fix all the things again that I intentionally erased.

I am so sorry for your loss

"Thanks again, that was my TIL for today :)"
"I couldn't get over the idea of a ""favorite nipple""

Like I have never considered one nipple better than the other."
quick! everyone unsub
"I know, but what could i have done at that point lol

edit: There was actually a smear of poo on the closed toilet lid, and the man said the toilet wasn't working. I also never heard him turn the light on so in a dark room he must of sat himself down on the loo, tried to push it out and it didn't work, so then hopped into the sink. Fuck my life. "

"&gt;I got fired for promoting religious tolerance at work, looking to sue for wrongful termination and defamation

... Wait, so you induced a panic attack on someone who told you they have anxiety issues after they handed you a religious flier, and you want to sue them for firing you? You created a hostile work environment for a coworker once you found out about their religion and their mental health.  It's not like you made an off-color remark once.  You orchestrated a campaign against another employee over this stuff. The proper response to proselytizing in the workplace is ""hey, I respect your religion but I'd prefer to keep it out of the workplace.""  The proper response to finding out someone has a severe phobia is not to willfully mess with their mental health in an attempt to get them fired because you find it funny and disagree with their religious views, it's to be a decent person. How on Earth is your former company not supposed to fire you? 

Yeah, you fucked up big time, but mostly by being a pretty big dick.  Instead of suing, you should apologize.  Profusely.  "
Better throw another orange at that remaining good eye
"If you microwave something to clean it, be careful not to gas yourself.

He won't see it coming 
Wait did that really work? Thought he was just fucking with you lol
Finally I've heard someone else has had this happen to them. I slipped by an open dishwasher when I was younger and ended up with a fork protruding from my right butt cheek. Makes for a pretty great story and a pretty hilarious scar.
I second this one. Like you said...make sure to fix ALL 3 THINGS right away. It helps. 
"Full panic mode. i was watching a movie at the theatre once as a kid and put a whole ice cube in my mouth to suck on. went straight to the back of my throat and blocked my airway. i stood up in freak out mode, couldnt talk but motioned to my friend for a sec before deciding to run out of the theatre to the bathroom to try and throw it up or something. running all that way not able to breathe i think helped because after sitting at the toilet for 10 seconds trying to do something other than pass out, it melted enough i could breathe again. so damn relieved i still remember that feeling all these years later"
Thats commonly referred to as a dick move.
No it's really not. The steam cleans the microwave and the lemon will help take care of the burnt smell. 
Tifu by emptying a whole subreddit.
I wouldn't worry. It should heel nicely. 
[removed]
This happened to me last year when i swallowed a pill and it went down wrong. There is a nerve in your throat called the Vagus nerve that you can inadvertently stimulate when swallowing something large or awkward. This results in a vasovagal reaction which causes you to faint.
"Either the hospital needs a better toaster, or you need to limit yourself to only having toast when you know you have a full 5 minutes to wait for it.

And why it was a good thing you did to share the story.

"Moral 3. Buy a rice cooker. -I don't understand people who scoff at rice cookers for this very reason. It makes the rice perfectly, you don't have to monitor it, and it will keep the rice warm until you have everything else ready. You can usually buy one for around $10."

"I have a choking story.  I'm sure I'll spend more time telling this than it is worth since no one will likely read it, but here goes.

One late night after my wife and kids had gone to bed I was playing video games.  Remembering that I had a soft pretzel from WaWa, I decided to have a snack.  Being really hungry, I took a large bite and almost immediately try to swallow it.  But the pretzel gets lodged.  I try to cough it out but it becomes apparent this thing isn't coming out.  It aint going to melt either like a piece of ice.  Strange moment.  I'm virtually alone and I realize that I'm in trouble.  I'm going to die playing video games choking on a pretzel.  Perfect. But I figure I have one option.  I stumble down the hall and kick the bedroom door open.  I flip on the lights and start shaking the bed since I can't talk or even make a noise other that this dying dog sound.  My wife looks at me angrily for waking her up.  I point to my neck and make another dying dog sound.  I see the sudden realization in her eyes and she jumps out of bed like the Flash. She gets behind me, gives me the Heimlich (hey I spelled that correctly the first time, nice).  The pretzel dislodges and comes up in my mouth.  I chew the piece and swallow it.  My wife doesn't say a thing and goes right back to bed.  I turn off the light and go back to the living room.  I look at the pretzel, shrug, and go right back to eating it and playing games.  I wake up the next morning and my wife looks at me and asks ""did I save your life last night?""  Yes honey, you did.  Thanks."
11k times 100. You should have let him finish talking...
Well done.  Give this guy a hand.
Me too... Jesus...
"Choking is one of the scariest things in the world! Maybe one of them has choked before, when they were just a small child or were in some way powerless and it was the catalyst for them rising to power at this company. Maybe they'll see in you a little bit of themselves and they'll have no choice but to promote you. 

But seriously hope you're okay, good luck with everything! Choking is truly terrifying and I hope they understand your reaction. "

"That sucks.  I once got pulled over for an expired plate.  It had been expired for nearly a year.  Only cost me $70 though.  Got pulled over once for a tail light being out, but he let me go after I explained the dealership broke it and replaced it during an oil change the previous day and I had no idea it wasn't working properly."

Thanks! I'm glad I could find some explanation. Sorry to hear you also experienced it though😐
You could say that he'll be blindsided by it
No. If you can't handle someone handing you a piece of paper containing opinions you don't agree with then you shouldn't be allowed to work there. YOU are intolerant. YOU are the problem.

It's actually really easy. You have to sit outside for an hour or two each day and throw them food. Overtime they'll get more and more comfortable with you and eventually they'll beg at your door and eat out of your hand.

"Glad you guys are ok. Use baking *soda or salt to put out oven fires in the event it should happen again. Also, apartment buildings often provide small fire extinguishers which is ideal, I'd recommend asking your landlord about it if you don't have one in your apartment somewhere. Especially after an incident like this, they should be willing."
Then talk to your HR dept. DO NOT RETALIATE ON YOUR OWN

"Yes. I almost killed a coworker (slight exaggeration) when I forgot about his food allergy. After he came back to work and he was feeling better, I apologized profusely, we chatted about his allergy, and I joked about getting him a ""sorry I almost killed you"" card (which he thought was funny).

Own up, make a joke, and laugh once you're able to move on."

"Why do they make toasters with a setting that would potentially burn the toast? I mean maybe for time's sake, but unless you're hovering over that toaster it could turn into a burnt mess so quick. Or potentially a hospital "
"Don't over explain. Don't bother yourself convincing them, either. If you're doing the right thing then you know that they are being idiots about it, and why does an idiot's opinion matter? Keep doing what is right.

Do, however, cover your bases from now on. In that situation, I wouldn't have worried about being late for class - ""I was in the office returning a lost cell phone"" is pretty noble and probably excusable. So it would have been a good idea to wait until the receptionist got off the phone and you could have explained yourself upfront. Most of the time people will draw conclusions if they don't know the actual story. The longer you let their conclusion fester in their mind, the more they will be influenced by it and will stick to it. Then, if they pull other people into it (like the principal and your parents) they spread their assumed conclusions (which isn't their fault - they didn't know any better) and then the newcomers start off on the wrong side and are harder to persuade. It's best to be up front about things."
"I think the funniest, most ironic part of this statement is that you thought you were

&gt; stop being a baby about this

""If Markenson's won't give you a refund, why should we?""

""No! You're the police! I found this cell phone and I want to return it to its original owner.""

""Oh, I see. Harry, have any of the boys reported a lost cell phone?""

""Don't think so, Grimm.""

""Sorry, it's not ours. Perhaps someone at Markenson's lost it. Good day.""

""Are you or are you not the owner of that phone there in your hand?""

""I'm not!""

""So you admit it!""

""This is insane! I found it! It was just laying there!""

""That's what they all say. Come now, let's have a DNA sample.""

""Oh, bollocks!""

""No, sir, we just swab your cheek. That's a good chap. Come along.""

""This is ridiculous! I merely found this phone and turned it in out of a sense of civic duty! I

""Loud and clear, Grimm.""

""But I thought...""

""Obviously.""

""Then this isn't...?""

""Afraid not.""

""I see.""

""Quite.""

""So you'll be wanting my DNA then?""

""There's a good chap. Has anyone ever told you you look like Michael Palin?""

""Can I help you, sir?""

TL;DR: Guy brings Phone to police, so they can return it to the Owner, gets arrested for stealing it
