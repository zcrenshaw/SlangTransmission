My thought EXACTLY. I'd make sure to bite your own arm at least 3 times a year for a decade or so after that... Give it some plausibility 
"Talking down those headsets unintentionally happens more than you think, I used to work in a store that had them but they were always on unless you flipped the mute switch, one day one of the supervisors went off to the loo and had quite possibly the loudest shit I have ever heard while his headset was still on.

I don't think she fully understood the magnitude of the problem at hand. 
"Same, I'm kind of disappointed."
"It's ok op. Everyone has been an child idiot once in their lives.

When I was 6, I decided that it would be possible to tie a jump rope to my waist and jump from our 16 foot deck. I don't know what the plan was after that. But I was very excited. I waited until my mom was with my younger siblings.  I tied the jump rope to my belly. I climbed to the outer side of the deck. I looked at the concrete below,  and I braced myself to jump.  Just before I did my dad came sprinting from the driveway yelling for me stop and get back on the deck.  He loves to tell this story.  He never leaves out the fact that I only tied the rope to my belly and dropped the other end without tying it to the balcony.  "
Why was she trying to make you shit yourself? Who profits from that?
"I had a bout of insomnia before I quit my soul sucking job. I was prescribed ambien. It turned me into a sex crazed lunatic. I would take my pill and go to bed only to discover I started sexting my husband after it kicked in luring him to come upstairs. The final straw was when I accidentally sent a rather incoherent sext to my best friend instead of my husband. She thought it was hilarious. 

No more ambien for me. "

I like to think this was meant to happen for the sake of having a good story to tell my future stoner grandkids.

"Sorry to disappoint you. Not sorry, though, really. I didn't shit myself and I am okay with that. Cheers!"
Wtf. You might have a medical condition because this isn't remotely normal. The fact that you laughed about the whole thing like a maniac solidifies it even further.
Reminds me of the time a homeless guy told me he was hungry. Got him a burrito. He threw it in the trash in front of me. Told me he didn't like burritos.

"You didn't fuck up, you saved the restaurant because a manager didn't want to have the awkward conversation of ""I'm sorry, we literally CANNOT make the item you ordered. You really were the hero. If a manager ever tried to seriously bitch me out after some kind of madness like that, I'd walk out.

My greatest fire related story is when my coworker decided to drain the fryer with the burners still on, overheated the heat tubes or whatever they're called, and set the entire fryer on fire. A pinch of baking soda saved that shitty restaurant from burning down. The owner bought me a beer and a steak for not using the fire extinguisher, which would have been $500 to replace, and I got a $1 raise."
Not a fuck up. Just life.
Post-operative complications following a varicocelectomy 11 months ago.  Basically they didn't close of one of the veins all the way or correctly.  I bled so much internally that the hematoma went all the way up into my abdomen and the far left side of my rib cage and down my leg a bit too. Fucking wrecked me.

"TGAAFU... not you.   Grown ass adults are responsible for their behavior.   You didn't make them act like idiots, they did that all on their own. 

Edit for autocorrect."
Don't breathe this. 
"Well hopefully you learned that if you wouldn't say something to someone's face, you shouldn't say it behind their back, either. Telling a friend about someone you are attracted to is one thing, that's ""man talk"" but telling a coworker who you just met about another coworker's body while in the workplace is scummy. You set a precedent to a new employee that it's ok to discuss coworker sexually. "
"One thing that I find really confusing though is why the heck would you call the parents in if you really suspect abuse? What are you expecting, that the parent would admit it? In most cases this kind of parent/teacher meeting just ends up where the parent makes an excuse, and then kid gets their ass beat at home for 'snitching' or 'making trouble'. "
"I had a similar situation happen a few years ago. My girlfriend wanted to go to Pizza Uno for some reason. I'd never been there before, but was like okay, whatever. We eat our pizza and i have to drop some poo immediately, before we even leave the restaurant. I do my business and we leave. Five minutes into the drive home, I realize I have to poop again, even worse than last time.  

So, I already did one ""emergency poo"" (as my gf liked calling them for some reason) at the restaurant, and less than ten minutes later, there's another emergency poo on its way. This never happens for me. I almost never get sick from greasy food, but I've never before (or since) had two of them so close together.

So, I'm trying to get home and telling my girlfriend, ""I seriously think I'm going to crap my pants."" I really did not think I'd be able to hold it until I got home. Stopping somewhere with a bathroom and going never occurred to me for some reason. I just kept focusing on getting home. I was already starting to figure out how I could clean the shit off the car seat, because I was damn positive I was crapping my pants on the way home and covering my car seat in poop.

About halfway home, with me still just barely managing to hold it in, my girlfriend decides to start tickling me because she thinks it's funny to see me panic and think I'm gonna crap my pants. Remember, I'm fucking DRIVING as well. She shouldn't be tickling me just because of that. 

But she won't stop and thinks it's funny to see me freak out. Finally I yell at her, ""I am going to shit on your face if you don't stop tickling me. I'm not even kidding."" She actually stopped and I somehow made it home and to the bathroom in time.

So there's not really a TIFU there, but my girlfriend thought it'd be funny if I shit my pants, apparently."
"THIS is not uncommon, OP :)  I used to be a vet tech, and we had people come in, insisting that their dog had a tick, and they tried to remove it, which resulted in a bit of a bloody mess when they realized it was doggy nipples.

As long as your kiddo is fine, usually if you can get ticks off of them within 24 hours of them embedding, you're okay.

Do you put preventative on your dog?  If not, I'd HIGHLY recommend it if you're in an area where there are ticks (even if your kiddo doesn't spend a long time outside)   my little old guy would bring them in from a quick pee in the yard...."
"I fucking hate ticks. And I live outside of town where it's very rural and every spring/summer it's the worst. Can't keep our dogs from getting them. We spray that tick guard lawn stuff and it doesn't seem to keep them out, shampoos don't seem to work at all for longer than a few days, collars and topical drops don't do anything. I have researched and can't seem to find a way to keep those disgusting little bastards off our pups. Ticks are the worst product of evolution I hate the little bloodsucking shits."
This sounds more like stupid kids doing stupid shit. I don't see where your fuck up was really.

"I used to work AV for a college and once set up a guest lecturer  with a wireless mic for his presentation.  Thing is I instructed him to keep his mic muted until he was ready to talk as the speakers were set up and ready to go.  He went to the restroom and accidentally unmuted his mic and the entire lecture heard him taking a massive shit.  I was able to get to the front and shut the receiver down quickly, but everyone heard the poo power struggle taking place just off stage."

"Man, ambien was the best. When it was kicking in I felt so relaxed and happy, music was really great too. I'd fall asleep with a big smile on my face and wake up feeling completely refreshed. It's one of the reasons I don't want to take it again - it's too nice."
Now wasn't the ideal time...
