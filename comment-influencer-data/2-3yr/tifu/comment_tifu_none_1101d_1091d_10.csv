Assuming you do eventually want to propose to this girl, you should again tell her you have something special to give her. She'll now think you'll disappoint again but humors you anyway. She shows up. You give her another rubber stamp in a ring box. She's thinking you've blown it again. But this time you're prepared. You give her a piece of paper and tell her to use the stamp. She rolls her eyes and stamps the paper. The stamp is of a diamond ring. She's in shock and looks back at you. You're on your knee with the real ring in hand. You pop the question. She says yes. 5th times the charm."

You have no idea...this is literally the fourth time something like this has happened. The last time this happened I told her to put out her hand and close her eyes. She put her hand out and I put a big ol' ink STAMP on it. I was excited about a new custom stamp I ordered...Oops.

General rule of thumb - when dealing with a stranger that is - is if there's something wrong that can be fixed quickly (i.e lipstick on the teeth) you can say something. Something they can't do anything about? Leave it.

Sounds like an honest mistake. Your poor wife. Don't feel too bad; I'm sure she knows you love her...to death. Hahah! Too soon?

"Haha fortunately for you, temazepam is a benzodiazepine, which is way less toxic than what we used for insomnia before, i.e. barbiturates. People had a regrettable habit of taking larger doses either accidentally or voluntarily and dying. Anyways the symptoms you felt are not unusual, especially for someone who took 4x the usual dose, lots of sedation and low muscle tone. You should have eliminated all of the drug within 2 to 3 days. As for the kid part, it really depends on the weight of the kid, usually we start being in trouble at 10 to 20 times the normal dose. Hope that answers your questions!

Cue popping sound, followed by just a second or two of confusion which was then followed by excruciating pain.

"I was at a bar a couple of years ago after an FSU basketball game and  paying for my beer (not an open tab, just one beer). The beer was maybe $4, so I tipped $1 (25%). Some hipster girl next to me goes ""Really? You're only tipping him $1? You need to have respect for people in the food industry!"" all pissed off, saying how she works in the food industry and it's people like me who don't tip and yada yada. I was quite drunk because ""sweetheart"" is a word I probably only use in regards to the [candy](http://www.necco.com/candy/sweethearts.aspx), but drunk me knew that this would send this girl over the edge, so I turned to her and said ""Listen here sweetheart, it's none of your damn business what I tip. I gave 25% on one beer, thats plenty!"" HOLY SHIT, you would have thought someone just took away her right to vote, it was glorious. Probably one of the most satisfying moments related to an argument in my life. She was screaming at the top of her lungs causing a scene demanding that I leave the bar and get away from her. So being a drunk asshole (which imo was completely warranted after her stunt) I sat right next to her casually sipping my beer just to piss her off. But then my friend came and got me because I forgot I was suppose to get him a beer too.

TL;DR - Bitchy hipster girl was rude and called out my more than reasonable tip, called her sweetheart, blew her mind."

"I'm still kinda homeless. Me and her broke up about 3 weeks ago. We have a 9 month old, she sneaks me in her house every night. We are civil. I now work 2 jobs. I probably could afford my own apartment, but I'm so used to only paying for my phone and things for my baby. Plus I made so many friends just from sitting in places during the day. I have been doing this for so long, it's kinda the norm. I'm not one of those ""can you spare some change"" homeless, you couldn't even tell I am. I am doing much better tho. Thanks for asking :)"
"I read this as ""Hey baby, you and I should get married. Put on your best lipstick and lick my dick until the sun comes up b. Then wash the taste out with two cups of coffee.""

"Happened to me at 19. I don't think she understood the hurricane of thoughts, emotions, and potential lifetimes that flashed through my head in those 10 seconds. 

When she finally said ""kidding! Negative!"" I just collapsed to my knees, instant relief and exhaustion.

"""Pokèstop inside"" is written on mine."
"It's somewhat fun to give someone like that a resume with nothing to work with. They either go back and interview you a bit, or if they are lazy/dishonest they will just make shit up. 

Sometimes the made up stuff is reasonable, or just slightly embellished. Like if you had written that you could use word, they would change it to ""Proficient with Microsoft office""  or ""Editing Wizard""  or some other shit. Sometimes they just make shit up 100% ""Has the biggest dick you've ever seen.""  or ""Can summon ghosts on command"" maybe even ""Based on a diagram by Jane Fonda"" "
I currently make my living on the markets. I see no difference between it and a hand of poker.

"Well, yeah, ok. 

But then where does she shove the ring in the next step? :D"
"&gt;  You give her a piece of paper and tell her to use the stamp. She rolls her eyes and stamps the paper. The stamp is of a diamond ring. She's in shock and looks back at you. You're on your knee with the real ring in hand.

But that's what money and affluence buys you, vs being homeless and working at Walmart."
