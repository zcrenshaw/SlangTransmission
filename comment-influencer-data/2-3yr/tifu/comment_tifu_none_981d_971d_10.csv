"I used to work for Sprint and once upon a time our lifeproof rep came in to show us the new cases and show the durability. Some customers were in the store looking at cases so he had them come see his multiple stress tests. He did a few different drop tests, a water test and what called the toss test. Literally just tosses the phone into a wall. 

The last test he decided to show us was a ball drop. So he sets the phone on the ground and drops a little metal ball from chest height. Totally cracks the screen. Must have done it one too many times. Customers laughed and then left. He was pretty embarrassed

I tip my top hat. ""Tis a proper mustang! A steed of swift proportions, and I'm not talking about my horse!"" I let out a hearty chuckle as my mustang neighs in unison. 

""Now! Don't tarry, miss, I must have you back by a reasonable hour! I don't fancy wasting my time on a trollop!""

""Ok..."" She says, as she closes the door slowly.

"Honestly, I'd say don't use *any* movie for dating advice. Ever. 

If ever there were a King of Awkward, I considered myself that for a long, long time. It wasn't until a friend gave me a single piece of advice that it clicked: **follow your instincts.**

No matter how socially awkward a guy is, learning to listen to those built-in instincts is a lot more valuable than looking to movies for advice. Movies are pretty much never realistic about people's reactions to the actions the man/woman take. It is a fantasy, and you cannot live a fantasy in the real world because we are quite literally, on a biological level, not built to feel and think they way people in movies do.

And no, those random (often shitty) thoughts that pop into your head from time to time are not instincts, do don't confuse ""I suck"" or ""what would happen if I drove the wrong way into traffic"" with an actual instinct. Those thoughts have nothing to do with instincts... I won't get into what they are or why they happen, but just don't mix them up with what an instinct is. 

Feel like you want to move in closer? Do it. Does she instantly move away? Not necessarily a bad sign... move back and try it again later when the instinct kicks back in. Does she react more favorably this time? Good. Does she once again seem to revile? Your instincts were not wrong, they directed you and you learned exactly what you needed to know. 

Now you move on... if she keeps reacting favorably, keep following your instincts. If she keeps reacting negatively, move on because nothing you do will change how she is reacting. It isn't ""you,"" just like it isn't ""her"" doing something wrong. You do not need to ""fix"" yourself or just ""try harder"" to make her love you. You did not make a connection, and you cannot ""make"" another person do or feel anything. And if you do ""make"" them feel or do something... well then you're being manipulative at best, which is a terrible place to come from when it comes to dating for everyone involved. 

Time to move onto the next one... and I know (from personal experience) that it may feel like there will never be a ""next one"" and just getting one date was lucky. This is your brain literally mindfucking you. It's just one of those thoughts I mentioned earlier, give it no power, pay it no mind (and I know how hard that can be). 

TL;DR - instincts. Follow them, they are there from billions of years of evolution, and they can be a powerful guide. "

""I don't need insurance, that's a scam"". I roll my eyes and hand them bags with their boxes and paperwork. Two minutes later they come back, kids crying. I guess they had fought over each other's phones and so they must've been dropped or thrown in the parking lot. Screens were totally shattered. 750 per phone and they didn't last more than 2 minutes.

"I imagine it might mean they know he had cancer, but hadn't heard about how he'd noticed things were wrong for weeks before he even went to a doctor about it, and prefers to let them think the diagnosis came completely out of the blue.

Even so, if this is the case, I'm surprised OP should be so hesitant to let this part of the story be known. Cancer survival is something most people are extremely proud of (and for good reason), and this part of the story, while it involves some poor decision-making, stems from an admirable determination, and it totally understandable. Plus, if his real-life friends don't know it, that implies this was at least a couple years ago. Last, OP says he wants to share his experience to dissuade other from the same thing, an honorable desire. But knowing the person this happened to is always more impactful than reading it on the internet, so I'd encourage OP to share his story in real life. But I'm glad he told it here. "
Thanks! Appreciate it. 
There is obviously more to this story. No one just does this.

"Reminds me of something a friend of mine did to a teacher - not as innocent though...

So in my high school class there's a guy with curly, rather long hair. Long for male. His hair would reach his lips while curled. If stretched, it'd be longer than that. Black hair. One day we're in a Bio class. We use the classroom as both classroom and lab. There are two classrooms connected by a lab prep room. So any teacher on the other classroom can just come through into ours. Guy with long hair, call him John, is sitting in the middle row, and another guy, call him Doe, is sitting in the right row. Out of nowhere, Doe sees John kneeling on the floor, tying his shoes or picking a pencil or whatever. So he just grabs his head and goes: ""OH YEAH JOHN, OH YEAH HMMM""

John, who is actually sitting in his place, looks at him, says: ""who's that, what are you doing?"" Doe stops, looks at the person, who stands up and happens to be a teacher who came from the other classroom and was tying her shoes. John's and the teacher's hair look alike, and we were all wearing lab coats, so it was pretty difficult to distinguish clothes too. So Doe basically just pretended John was giving him a blowjob. Except he did it to a teacher instead. Surprisingly, there were no repercussions and we all just laughed outside. This joke went on endlessly and I'm sure if I mention it today they'll remember. "

"In the words of some other commenters in this thread, 'Hey, I'm sorry to be *that* guy, but...'

There are a few things about this story that tell me it's fictional, or at least that OP has taken some liberties in the telling of it.

1) The story is too close to one written by Chuck Palahniuk, 'Guts'. The story can be found here: 

http://chuckpalahniuk.net/features/shorts/guts

It is the second story within the narrative, starting with the words ""Another friend of mine"".

2) I find it hard to believe that a piece of candle wax would actually be sucked down into the bladder by some unknown force. As corroborated by the experienced folks at r/sounding , a solid rod would be prevented from going too far down the urethra by the &gt;90 degree bend in the latter. If a sound does get 'lost', it can simply be retrieved when the penis becomes flaccid again. In the unlikely event that the candle wax broke up inside the penis, one really could simply push on their perineum (the skin between yer willy/vag &amp; yer bumhole) or on their prostate to remove the object.

There is simply no way that the candle wax could move beyond the bone on its own. Either OP is lying (in which case start investing heavily in pitchfork shares) or he was more, shall we say, 'determined', than he lets on.

3) The pain and risk of infection from a FOB in the bladder would be far too great to go on with one's life like OP claimed to. As the unfortunate recipient of a testicular torsion, I can tell you that severe pain in the hips can make you unable to even stand. I highly doubt that OP suffered for years with 'excruciating' pain that 'never got better'. No, any reasonable person would have seen a doctor by then, shame or no shame. 

Then there's also the disease side of things. Pink urine means internal bleeding which means a hole in the bladder. Which means emergency room which means discovery which means OP is a fraud.

4) Nobody would be able to pass a long foreign object like that after 2 years. Even after just a few months, a highly textured object sitting in a mixture of minerals like calcium will begin to grow. This is a key detail from 'Guts' which OP missed out on. Crystals would form on the wax, and the stick would become fossilised until it turned into a massive bladder stone. No, OP would be missing a penis by now if that was true.



In conclusion, OP has told us a wonderful parable. Maybe the best parable, I don't know. It is something to look at and learn from. Something to shiver and shudder at, and to help us associate candle wax with genital pain that we might be delivered from internal injury.

But like most parables, it is untrue. Maybe like the best parables, I don't know."

"So, fun fact. Real historical ninjas did just that. They dressed as farmers or as peasants, people who guards and the samurai would easily overlook and ignore. When you think about it, it would be incredibly obvious to have someone walking around in all black.

So how do we get the modern image of ninjas wearing all black? Japanese theater. In traditional Japanese theater like Kabuki, stagehands wear all black so that they won't be confused for actors. Audiences would grow used to ignoring them. 

 So some brilliant playwright had a genius idea: Dress the ninjas like stagehands. You would be watching a play, and then suddenly one of the stagehands would leap out and murder one of the characters. Over time, this theatrical trope came to influence how the modern world and the Western world saw ninjas."

"I worked at an Apple Store from 2010-2012. I remember one day a guy ran in brandishing an Android. He yelled at the top of his lungs ""THIS PHONE IS BETTER THAN YOUR SHIT PHONE!"" and slammed it down on the table in front of him for emphasis.

The screen was basically destroyed. He looked at it, looked at all of us, looked back at the phone.

Then he ran back out of the store and we all went back to work.

EDIT: Damn guys, was literally just sharing a story. If you're doubting that one then there's no way you'd believe some of the crazier stuff that went down. 

Also, less about iPhones v Androids (any iPhone would have been messed up if you slammed it on a table too) - more ruminating on the fact that it takes a particular kind of privileged hubris to risk a piece of technology worth hundreds of dollars just to make a point that basically amounts to the same thing as ""my dad would kick your dad's ASS!""

Except with phones.
