"As someone who has done judo for decades...

You shouldn't be learning how to throw people if you haven't first mastered how to *fall* and how to *be thrown*.

Yes, these are two things you can learn.

Assuming those two criteria are met, accidentally throwing your opponent while practicing a technique at full speed is perfectly understandable and happens frequently with beginners who are still learning to control their applied power. It is especially common when there is a size/weight disparity between the participants.

When pairing people for practice, you should try and pair up people by size/weight. It doesn't matter if both participants are of the same skill level as having one participant more skilled allows them to help teach the other the technique and in so teaching helps them master it as well.

Chastising someone for this is not only premature, but immature as well."

"I was having a miscarriage and was bleeding really badly, so we went to the ER. I was sitting in a wheelchair on a towel, and bled through the towel, filled the seat of the wheelchair, and then it began steadily dripping onto the floor. The whole time I was in horrible pain. After a pretty big puddle of blood formed on the floor under me, my father and husband went to the desk to ask if I could be seen any sooner, and we're handed pads and wet wipes and told that I could wipe up in the lobby bathroom. She also insinuated that this was all normal miscarriage stuff. When I was finally taken to a room an hour later, I took off my pants and a ton of blood and other tissue fell out, enough to splatter UP A WALL. Finally a doctor came in, saw that I was turning slowly blue around the lips, yelled at the nurse who was trying to get my STANDING blood pressure, and examined me. It turns out something was wrong and I was hemorrhaging, and I was taken away for an emergency d&amp;c. When I woke back up, I was on the labor and delivery floor and a nurse was gently putting a heated blanket on me, and with tears in her eyes said she was so sorry I was treated so badly. A hospital administrator came by later to get a statement from me about my treatment in the ER, apparently she heard about it from the L&amp;D nurses. Later my family told me that they didn't want to scare me but before they took me for surgery, I was white as a sheet with blue lips and my blood pressure had plummeted. 
So yeah, sometimes ERs suck ass. 

Edit: Wow, my most popular comment ever! Thanks for all the love, it did suck really badly at the time! I ended up having 2 other miscarriages and getting a divorce because of the emotional toll (blame games) but there is a bright side, I got pregnant a few years later and my new doctor discovered I have a blood clotting disorder, so I had to have a heparin pump for that pregnancy and now I'm laying in bed next to the sweetest snoring 5 year old ever. So if you have issues with miscarriages, ask your doctor to look into blood clotting disorders!

"I was about to bring my son to his fathers before work when suddenly I noticed he was crying on the couch. From what he described, I assumed he might have a UTI and decided to bring him to urgent care. He cried the whole way there and was hobbling by the time I got him to urgent care. The nurse listened to what I had to say, ran her own tests, and then had my son give a urine sample. The sample came back negative for a UTI. 

The doctor comes in, pushes on my sons sides and pelvis and immediately proclaims my son is having an appendicitis and needs to go to an ER at this exact moment. 

So we haul ass to the ER - I am calling my work to tell them I won't be in and why - My sons father is causally asking I keep him updated - My fiancé is blowing up my phone asking if he should come to the hospital - Traffic is bullshit - And my son is still bawling his eyes out.

We get to the ER and my son can barely walk so I pick him up and find him a wheelchair. They admit him immediately (because urgent care called and said we were on the way) and they quickly run my son to get an ultrasound so they have an idea what they are dealing with. They bring us back to the ER room and start walking me through the process/what I should expect with the surgery after they evaluate the ultrasound.

Ten minutes later my son is sitting up - saying he feels much better all of a magically fucking sudden. Doctor comes in and lo and behold! 
He needs to poop...

That was a magical day...

"Let me counter you with my own story.


Back in February I woke up one morning and immediately threw up before my shower. I was having pains in my abdomen, but they were mild at best. I texted my mom and told her my symptoms to see what she thought. She agreed with me--probably just a bug. I told my friend I wouldn't be in, my symptoms, and went back to bed and hoped it would go away.

I wake up 4 hours later, feeling no better and with 3 missed calls from my friend and about 10 texts. I call her back. She tells me I need to go to a hospital NOW because I have appendicitis. I scoffed at her, but she was insistent, so I went to a small clinic on campus. They drew some blood, did a few tests, and then came back and said they weren't giving my keys back to me. ""You'll get them back when someone comes to pick you up. This is so clearly appendicitis that I can't justify letting you walk out of here on your own, and you DEFINITELY can't drive.""

Now, these people once prescribed me a relatively strong dose of codeine because I needed a doctor's note saying I couldn't sing for one of my classes. I don't trust their judgement. But, they had my hands tied, so my friend took me to the ER. Here, they stuck me a few more times, tested me, and then the nurse comes into the ER.

""What's your pain at right now?""

""Eh. About a 3, maybe 4.""

She then kicks my friend out of the room.

""Okay. Now that she's gone, what's your ACTUAL pain level.""

""Well, she's gone so now it's like a 2.""

""Bullshit. I don't need you to act tough, I'm trying to figure out a morphine dosage.""

""It's... it's about a 4.""

She then left and got a male nurse to come in and be buddy-buddy with me. He talked about sports (I hate sports but I'm a therapist so I'm used to listening to people talk about things that are important to them even if they hold no interest for me). He talked about the time he got sacked and broke his shoulder. He talked about how he kept playing anyway, and ended up losing mobility in his arm because of it. ""So... how's your pain level?""

""About a four.""

""Then what the fuck is a ten?""

""I assume circumcision.""

So then they dosed me up anyway. Apparently, with as inflamed as my appendix was, I was at INCREDIBLY high risk for it bursting. They were amazed it hadn't already. According to them, most people at the state I was in were bent over in pain, barely able to talk. That's just not what I experienced. And just so you don't think I'm trying to act tough, I winced hard every single time they poked me with a needle. My pain tolerance is zilch. Sometimes, these symptoms present themselves differently for different people.

Had I listened to my own thoughts, I would probably have been septic by that night and possibly died. At the very least, I would have had a few months of recovery instead of a few weeks. You did the safe thing. You got checked. Yeah, it's expensive, but you didn't KNOW that you just needed to poop. You very well could have been saving your own life. Have no fear bud."
"You do realise you have to raise him now right, you claimed him as your own"
At least they weren't snorkeling. Just imagine pulling in a deep snorkel-full of that nasty butt coffee.
When I was a kid I had a mass removed from my knee and when I woke up after the surgery I apparently started screaming for my mom. My lovely nurse's idea of solving the problem was putting her hands over my mouth and nose until I stopped screaming. Luckily my mom heard my original yell and caught her practically trying to suffocate me. Needless to say she was fired. 
HAHAHA I would fucking laugh my ass off. Let me know if you see one.

"Don't feel too bad.  I've been training in various arts for a few decades and this situation should've never happened in the first place.  From your description of the event, I have to assume that you're place of training may be of questionable quality.

4) Instructors that aggressively demonstrate self defense on students and seem to ""show off""

5) Trophies lined around the perimeter of the entire facility yet advertise as a system of self defense.

If I wanted to fuck people over I'd have gone into finance, or business, or politics; I would not go and spend 100 hours a week seeing the poor and sick people for what works out as less than minimum wage. 

I don't get any more or less money based on how I treat people. Everyone gets treated the same, and that is the best way as per the most reliable evidence that we have available to us.

"Late to this thread, but I used to hear a similar story growing up. During WWII, my Nanu (Italian grandfather) was a USN Seabee in the Pacific Theater. One night, he was on watch on his ship, looking for white water (apparently a sign that an enemy submarine was surfacing to fire torpedoes). In the middle of his watch, he spots bubbling water off the starboard bow and calls it in to his commander. They confirm the same, and fire off depth charges. Ended up blowing up a whale. I heard a lot of stories growing up about him, but I'm told he felt the worst about that one. 

He ended up getting his knee hit by an enemy grenade a little later on, and spent the majority of the rest of his life keeping my grandmother pregnant. (Source- have 9 Aunts and Uncles on that side of the family)"

"Personally I say congratulations are in order. Talking to girls is terrifying right? But the very first time you tried you fell. Twice. And you bled everywhere and scared the shit out of her. Got knocked out and taken to the hospital.

The next time you ask a girl out what's the worst that could happen? She rejects you? She doesn't think of you that way? So fucking what? You're still conscious. No blood. At that point it's a win that you had a chance to even ask.

You've walked through fire, got burned pretty bad, but came out the other side alive. Nothing left to fear kid. You've got this."

"Next week on tifu: ""TIFU by following reddit's advice on a pickup line"""
"That's what is hard.  I work at an urgent care (front desk and scribe, so I see both sides) and have had people sent to the ER for unbearable abdomen pain.  The first trigger warning is his crying, ok some people cry, but he has to be able to keep it under control.  If he's flat out bawling and acting like he's dying, an urgent care just can't run the tests ASAP to find out if he's ok.  That's why people often get sent to the ER.  We actually had a patient who was seen here yesterday with ""the worst headache of her life"" (red flag) and had blunt force trauma to her head.  She was supposed to go last night.  Called us today asking us to prescribe her medication for the headache she's been having for about 4 days now.  She never went to the ER for the catscan and STILL has the headache.  I get that it's a lot of money, but what's the mean if you DIE because you refuse to listen to medical advice?? We refused to prescribe anything, if there's a bleed we're not masking that pain.  "

"A friend of mine used to work for a bank doing this exact sort of investigation. He always told people never to put in ""funny"" messages and just put something very innocent in the message box otherwise you would only end up getting your transfer held up, if you are flagged more than a couple of times your account gets frozen as well, pending investigation. 


People saying ""People have no sense of humour"" don't get that the systems the banks have are all automated (there are billions of transactions per day with most large banks) and just look out for keywords. If you get your transfer flagged someone has to go through your information and work out if it was a joke or not. They usually can tell it is a ""joke"" but the ""joke"" just isn't very funny. Mainly because there is no context available just a message stating ""goats for ISIS sex party"". 99% of the time they will just click ""allow"" and not hold it up by more than a day, however if you are the 1000th person that week to have attempted to be a comedian, with the same played out joke yet again, you may just become the butt of the ""joke"" that the security team (that's what they were called) decides to play on you. 



TLDR; If you don't find it funny when they fuck with you, stop fucking with them. "
