"On the bright side - you have a fine set of disco balls!

"Dude, this is exactly a relationship in the making. Hang out with her again, act like a normal human being and suggest you guys do something like see a movie or go ice skating. Don't drink. Make the night about getting to know each other. Apologize as she will also do so. Let he know that it was your first time, don't be ashamed. Everyone has a different story.

EDIT: To the people saying naughty things about the female, OP went out with the sole intent to get laid. It would be bad form to pass judgement on someone who likely went out to do the same, especially not knowing their last experience. To the people saying no to a movie or ice skating, OP has obvious limited dating experience. Both of those options allow him to become more comfortable around said female without giving him too much of an opportunity to put his foot in his mouth and mess up the mood, which is normal of people without a lot of dating experience. And lastly, if you're interested in the ""Update"" just click his name, he replied as a comment so it'll take time for it to work its way to the top. I won't spoil it."
"dude, that's how marriage stories go, call her and understand her, there are like millions of puke stories while giving BJs. I'd advise you to grow some balls if you want to lose your virginity, the girl seems pretty cool. Pretty stupid thing to bail on her like that though, she must be feeling like shit. Understand her POV for a moment, no wonder you have never kissed a girl, and she was so understanding...

EDIT: You also puked on her head, which is way worse than puking on your dick so you should apologise more.
Also, CALL HER, do NOT text her.

EDIT 2: No, I refuse to be kind because real life isn't kind. If you want to live a good life, you have to take risks and be more confident.

EDIT 3: I completely agree getting a guy to your flat 5 mins after you've met and blowing the shit out of him is not only shady but weird as fuck. My deductions are based upon the girl being normal and in a similar position, not a prostitute. Also I'd find it strange for the typical slut to go for a lonely, glasses-wearing guy. So when you call her, depending on if she is crazy or not, decide if you will break or make. Call her though, after all she apologised even in the morning and seems like she genuinely felt bad about it.

EDIT 4: Turns out the girl is normal and they knew each other before the time in the bar, still fucking weird that things came down to BJs that fast though, but I guess alcohol played a huge role. Let's hope for a happy ending guys, and OP losing his V-card soon and possibly a relationship with an interesting story to tell! :) *shakes away*"

"Ok, here's hot weather for dummies:

If it if over 98 degrees, you MUST sweat to keep your body functioning.  If the sweat cannot evaporate faster than it is produced due to humidity, you MUST reduce your exertion until it cools off, or you will suffer heatstroke.  This is not something that you can ignore because you are a tough guy.  A good coping strategy is to work in the morning, take a nap during the heat of the day, then work in the evening.

Let's talk hydration.
You need two things to work effectively in hot weather: water and salt.  Sports drinks like gatorade are great because they combine both.  A good rule of thumb is to take a hydration break and drink your fill every hour over 80 degrees, every half hour over 90, and every 15 minutes over 100.

In extreme dry heat, you should be targeting about a gallon per hour of a drink containing electrolytes (salt).  It is extremely important that you get enough salt -- you lose it when sweating! 

If you maintain excess water in your system, you should have no problem working effectively in extreme dry heat.  As soon as your body starts conserving water, you will stop sweating, body temperature will rise, and you will enter a feverish state.  This is known as heat exhaustion.

Recognizing heat exhaustion is a big fucking deal.  It is literally the difference between a trip to the hospital and an OSHA reportable injury or a quick breather.  Dizzyness, nausea, fatigue, and inability to think rationally are all symptoms.

Dealing with heat exhaustion is easy: rest, cooling, and hydration.  Sit down, ingest water and salt, and go into an ait-conditioned room if possible.  Once the symptoms abate, you are ready to go back to work (this time with a full jug of water to stay hydrated).

If you see that a co-worker is suffering from heat exhaustion, DO SOMETHING.  If you don't, they will continue to push themselves and overheat, leading to heatstroke.  This is a serious injury which requires hospitalization and can cause permanent brain damage! 

TL;DR:

In extreme heat, hydration and salt balance is a matter of life and death.

UPDATE:
If you don't have access to an electolytic sports drink, make sure to add extra salt to your breakfast, lunch, and dinner on days where you are doing manual labor outside.

EDIT:
Experts have noted that the max absorption for water is about 1L per hour.  This means that you need to preload with water before working in extreme heat rather than drinking 1Gal per hour, as I said earlier.  Also, don't forget that all-important salt!"

"Ubasute is a brutal form of euthanasia that translates roughly to ""abandoning the old woman."" An uncommon practice—only resorted to in desperate times of famine—where a family would lessen the amount of mouths to feed by leading an elderly relative to a mountain or similarly remote and rough environment to die, not by means of suicide but by dehydration, starvation, or exposure. Some insist this was not a real occurrence, but rather grim folklore. Regardless, stories of the Sea of Trees being a site for such abandonment have long been a part of its mythos."

"When visiting Tofino, staying at a resort on the beach, I went through pretty much the same ordeal.  It didn't cross my mind before but, the signs all around saying we were in a tsunami zone started getting the better of me.  I looked online, and it all went downhill.  I read all about how the next big earthquake will happen anytime, and generate a 60+ foot tsunami that will hit the shore 15 mins after the earthquake hits.  I checked the evacuation plan, and we were a 25 minute drive to the nearest high ground area that would not get submerged.  

As soon as I learnt this, I couldn't turn my brain off... Called front desk, cancelled my reservation and booked a hotel in higher ground.

"ER doc here, this is a GREAT post.  One little correction:  Heat exhaustion vs heat stroke is an important distinction here.

Heat exhaustion is heavy sweating, but the body's cooling systems are in overdrive.  Nausea/vomiting (which accelerates the dehydration), fainting (or near fainting), and fast pulse are noted.  

Heat stroke is when the cooling system has failed entirely.  THIS is when sweating stops.  Now, since there is no more evaporative cooling, body temp rises rapidly.  This is where major organ damage/multi-system organ failure is a real possibility.

Why?  Your body is made of proteins.  When the temp gets too high, those proteins unravel and stop working.

Best way to fix this?m  Honestly, in the ER, we do misting and fans.  The goal is to coat the person in a fine layer of water and then blow air over it to make it evaporate.  Evaporation takes away heat.  In extreme cases, we dunk them in an ice water bath, but the misting/fans method is preferred if time allows.  Having misters on site where people are doing manual labor is a good idea.

EDIT: To be clear, no I do not endorse drinking a gallon of water per hour.   This will lead to a dangerously low sodium!"

"UPDATE: I texted her and asked if she was busy to talk. She said she wasn't busy so I called her and explained and apologized. I asked her out and she said she gets off at work at 2 so maybe we can get a coffee or something after that. I am just happy she understood me as I felt like I was mumbling and not talking normally. We carried the conversation threw text since I had difficulty talking.



I shall also try to answer some of the questions that I have read. 

After the short call we exchanged some texts. I asked her how she had my number since I don't remember giving it to her. Apparently I gave it to her back in grade 11 we sat beside each other and also had to do a project together in biology. Then another project in grade 12 and finally a class together in University. I remember the high school portion but not the University one.

She bumped into me as we were both leaving and thus my glasses fell. She had recognized me though I didn't recognize her.

We talked and even had some food before we headed to her place though I don't remember any of this.

Yes I slept for nearly 30 hours. I had a headache and my body felt weird. Plus all the emotions. Some people eat to deal with stress, I sleep.

I am half Indian and half English. Came here from the UK and no I don't have the accent as I grew up here. My skin is brown.

Her making it up to me was about her puking and because she thought she had broken my glasses. Even though she had put them on face.

I had a pretty sheltered life. All I did was go to school, go home study and repeat. Even now its basically the same expect that I have a job as a translator.  Only documents so its perfect for me.

Skytrain is the rail system in the city that I live, which some of you manged to guess correctly as Vancouver.

"I have worked at a college for thirty years and you are correct in some ways. They do not hire PhDs fresh out of school for teaching positions, they want you to have experience teaching. Not the experience while you are pursuing your degree, but after you have completed it. 


This is where Adjunct positions come in. Many of the Lecturers here work at two or more Universities, and or Community Colleges, teaching a few course at each to make ends meet until they can get a teaching position. Like any other field, it can take a while to get the job you are aiming for. It sounds ridiculous, but the amount of time breaks down to the same as a regular job.

Also you may want to look at staff positions. The office next to mine has four people in it, three with PhDs and only one teaches. This keeps you in the University system, but making potentially more than the Adjunct roles would.


Depending on your degree, you can find work in the private sector. They often look for Phds for certain positions. These generally pay more, but it will get you farther from teaching.


TLDR: You are going to most likely have to start with a low paying adjunct position. It does initially suck, but in time the positions become better. "

"PhD here, currently in Academia, similar field.

**To be honest, this really doesn't make sense.** What kind of program did you graduate from that they didn't offer you a one-year lecturer position while you went on the market for a second year? This is really common, because lit jobs are few and far between, and that's especially true for the top programs. It impacts their rankings for their PhDs to not get TT* jobs, so they really aren't likely to just shrug and wave goodbye when you don't get a job your first year out. It looks good on them for you to get that job, even after a couple of years applying.

**I'd say the bigger TIFU is taking 8 years to do a Spanish Lit PhD.** That's entirely too long, and perhaps why the program you were in didn't offer another year of support. I really disagree with the advice to ""not finish your PhD"" or ""get another one"". People should finish as soon as they can while still doing good work, to show their programs and prospective employers that they know how to work efficiently and that they're not dragging their feet with the thesis. If someone applied to a position in my department having done two back-to-back PhDs for 16 years (assuming 8 each), I'd figure that they know exactly zilch about how the market works and might be a colleague I would have to explain practical, day-to-day things to on a regular basis.

**Also, a top-tier program wouldn't have you spending $2000 out of pocket to do interviews.** They comp you for things like the MLA* conference. That amount of money, and the fact that you apparently spent it yourself without reimbursement, does not make sense. And in a city like Austin (where the MLA was this year), it shouldn't cost that much for two hotel nights and a flight, especially if you share the room with another student.

Finally, a PhD in Spanish lit doesn't qualify you for just ""teaching Spanish 101"". In what world? You should have had experience teaching a wide variety of language and content courses throughout your PhD, and that's what you'd be expected to do as a TT faculty member.

And last edit to my rant: universities are gobbling up PhDs for lecturer and adjunct positions. Plenty of departments don't have graduate programs, so they wouldn't have students to give them to. And there's such a glut of PhDs from the last 6 years that departments can choose who they want, and they want PhDs because it looks better for the materials they send to prospective undergrad students, so they can brag about the qualifications of their faculty, adjunct through tenure line.

*TT = tenure track

*MLA = Modern Language Association conference, a biggie for language degrees, it's common to do first-round face-to-face interviews there after search committees have reviewed all applications. 

Side note: it can also be awkward af because the interviews are sometimes in actual hotel rooms. I had a friend who sat on the bed for his interview because they didn't have enough chairs. ...  

**Edit in response to someone calling me an ""arrogant twat"": I'm absolutely not aiming to bash OP as a person**, but I am pointing out inconsistencies and issues with how she's framing her fuck up. If OP wants to be successful in the next round of job searching, she needs a reality check in addition to sympathetic listeners.

Also, OP got to spend nearly a decade of her life doing something she truly loves, plus she met her husband while she was in the program. Not a bad deal, but it'll be even better once she can figure out how to land a job that lets her continue using her skillset to do cool things - inside academia or out.

**TL;DR** OP doesn't understand the market, took too long on her thesis, needs to look to her home department for better support"

My eyes followed him as he flew about 15-20 feet away from the porch, looped around, and literally suicide bombed right at me.

Struck him dead on, and, after incredibly flying a few more feet directly through the spray stream, he dropped dead on the porch. I let out a guttural noise asserting my dominance to the other wasps that might've witnessed the death, and left his body as a warning to the others who didn't. "

"Daytime, is a hockey player

Nighttime, is an essay slayer

On the sports bus with the team

Living up the college dream

Forgotten paper due that night

With 90 minutes left to write

Popped a Red Bull and some caffeine

Equal to nine cups of coffee

Wrote the paper, went to bed

But stayed awake two nights instead

Saturday played hockey dead

That evening crashed onto his bed

Sleep walked with his dick in hand

Roaming armed a foreign land

Deck the halls

With piss on the walls

And show the passersby deez balls

Slept in clothes, but woke up nude

Looking like a homeless dude

She's not there to judge whether she thinks the game is violent or not, or whether violent games are bad or not, her work is to assess your project under the guidelines set for it. IF they wanted to forbid this kind of proyect, they should have specified that on the guidelines.. your advisor should have known it was forbiden and informed you. That did not happen because it is not forbiden. She's not there to give out opinions about general issues, she's there to grade your work objectivelly from a technical/professional standpoint.

She's got nothing against your coding, or the technical decisions you made when creating your project, she's against an entire legal, profitable and successful industry that, whether she likes it or not, forms a huge source of employment for people with your same profile.. Even if she is against said industry, the university isn't the place to become an activist by fucking students up.. This would be like a professor failing my marketing project because it's abot a burger chain and she's vegan. That's a NO-NO..

"I went to a nude beach once with my wife. It's true, most of the people at nude beaches are men.  But I didn't care at all.  We went to a nude beach because we wanted to experience what it was like to just walk around completely naked without worrying about any social stigmas.

We got there and removed our clothes.  It was a gorgeous day.  I'm going to tell you something... being naked on the beach is 10x better than going clothed.  You feel so much more relaxed and unrestricted.  Wet bathing suits feel terrible too.  It was nice to just go in the water and be able to dry yourself off so easily and not sit in a damp pair of trunks.

I enjoyed swimming nude so much.  My wife was tired so I went myself. I swam so far out that I actually struggled a bit making it back to shore.

I finally make it and head to our spot for some water.  I see our towels, but my wife is no where to be seen.  I start wandering around looking for her in the sea of naked people, but nothing.

Finally, I spot her squatting behind some bushes.  I figure she must have had to go to the bathroom or something so I go to poke some  fun at her.  As I round the bushes, I see something that brings me close to vomiting, even today when I think of it.  I spot my wife on her knees, passionately sucking an older mans throbbing cock. I instantly fainted, and woke up to my wife giving me mouth to mouth resuscitation. 

I will never visit another nude beach again. "

"I hope this doesn't sound rude, but I'm a PhD student myself and fortunately in my field there are plenty of jobs available (broadly called organizational science).  

The important thing that factored into my decision to attend a phd program was that I knew the field had enough jobs available that I wouldn't run into OP's situation when I graduated.  I really think it does a disservice to students who could be interested in going into academia to say that they won't ever get a job or will have to be adjunct if they get their doctorate.  Sure, for some fields that will be the case.  But to pretend that it's a rude awakening to get your phd and ONLY THEN realize that finding a job will be difficult is pretty disingenuous in my opinion.  

The rest of the story is definitely unfortunate - it's not great to have to spend money like that.  But realistically there isn't a big market for people with a PhD in Spanish Literature, and that shortage of job openings didn't just develop over the last 5-10 years.

Well when she told me she had the occasional bed wetting, she didn't mention that she would just lay in it all night.   So of course it happened one night.  I went to adjust and felt a puddle on my mattress.  It was cold so it had been there a while and it smelled horrible.   I got so annoyed that she would just lay in it.  So I told her to go clean up.  She went in the bathroom with a pair of my shorts and didn't even wash up.   She just took the stuff off and put my shorts on.


I was still pretty understanding but one day she stayed and slept a little because I had to go to work.

STEP 1: BE ATTRACTIVE
"&gt; The next step was to get the immigration stuff sorted out.

Actually, that is usually worked on BEFORE you get married.


As a man who is married to an immigrant and went through the immigration process, none of this adds up.  The ""evidence"" you wanted to fabricate could not be done over a weekend ""honeymoon"".  My wife and I had to provide YEARS of conversations across all online media.  We had to show pictures of us at different locations, at different times, with different people.  We had to show airline tickets, dinner receipts, birthday cards, X-mas cards, gifts.  She had to go in for a medical evaluation and an interview at the consulate.  And we were one of the lucky couples who DIDN'T have to do a joint interview, but if she were from Turkey, we ALMOST CERTAINLY would have.  This is an agency that won't even accept a CHILD proven to be the progeny of both parties as proof of a bonafide relationship (ie, you have a kid, they can STILL say it's fraud and deport the immigrant).  This is a process where the interviewer can ask you questions like ""how many windows are located in the front bedroom of your fiance's apartment?"" and mark you questionable for not knowing the answer.  We went through all of this, and my wife is from the UK, which is not considered a ""high fraud"" country.


Top that off with the fact that he is from Turkey, which IS considered a ""high fraud"" risk by the USCIS, there is NO WAY, you provided enough evidence for them to let him stay in the US while you guys were separated.  Hell, a separation that quickly after the marriage would have been a red flag from the get go.  And that is assuming you provided any, you did say he wasn't contacting the correct agencies (of which there is pretty much just one anyway).


&gt; his lawyer actually told him that the best solution was to get married in the US.

NO lawyer worth anything would give this advice.  We're talking this is something Saul Goodman would have walked away from.


This marriage would be as legit as two 4 year olds saying ""I solemnly promise that I like you"" and telling everyone in the family they were married.

EDIT: And wouldn't an annulment be easier, since I'm assuming the marriage was never consummated?  This is a legit question, since I don't know much about divorce or annulment thankfully."

"I have a PhD at a top 5 international institution, and did my first postdoc at one of the Ivies. I'm currently back at my PhD institution doing a second fellowship. Last year, I applied to around 6-8 permanent posts. Received interviews, but no jobs. 

I'm not complaining. I'm pointing out that my situation is the norm right now in academia. If you want an academic post at a Top 100 research institution, note that you are competing against people from Oxford, Cambridge, Yale, Harvard, etc. If you are applying to smaller teaching colleges, you are also getting a lot of top candidates from top schools who are not as heavy into research. That's the competition.

Quite frankly, the OP is simply ignorant of the current situation in academia, and should have informed themselves by speaking with colleagues. As you say, 8 years to finish a PhD is much too long. The OP claims to have worked 60-70 hours a week. I doubt that very much. Either that, or this is the most terrifically inefficient PhD ever.

I might be overly harsh, but the OP has been living in a bubble for 8 years. 

&gt; TL;DR If you are doing a PhD, don't finish it. If you finish it, apply for another one. The only time you will be in Academia is if you are a student.

The is just terrifically **poor** advice, and I find it infuriating the OP is basically feeding the source of the problem which he/she is complaining about! The real lesson is **not** to do a PhD unless you have properly informed yourself of what you intend to do with the PhD, and moreover, have investigated the likelihood of this scenario occurring. The problem is not to encourage a saturated market of overqualified PhD-holders who should not have done a PhD in the first place.

Instead, we're getting a lot of PhD candidates who do an advanced degree because ""they love learning"". Then they spend 8 years doing a degree that should really be finished in 3-5, don't inform themselves of the job prospects, graduate, and then complain when they don't immediately snatch up an academic post that is getting 300-400 applications.

Did something similar once. Friends and I booked tickets to Costa Rica and a hotel for the entire 5 nights we would be there. When we arrived we realized we had flown into the airport on the complete other side of the country. Being that we are all broke college students we couldn't afford to pay the $600/person to fly to the other airport so we ended up having to rent a car and drive 4.5 hours to our hotel. Ended up being a beautiful car ride and we saw some of the most amazing things along the way! Would definitely fly into the wrong airport again.

"I'm a man and I love these damn things. We go to Lush and buy a bunch. Had one that turned the water blue. I don't give a shit what other men say.. taking a nice bath with pretty smells and cool colors or rose petals is the fucking shit.

I'll go do manly stuff at work or when I need to but give me a nice relaxing bath any time."
"This conjures a hilarious picture for me.

""Hey don't you want to have sex?""

The Dads are out in full force today
The orgasms come in waves 
"They're not saying that because she blew a guy she just met, it's because she cared enough to call and apologize and see if he was alright. It takes a big person to face their actions like that and not just take the easy way out"
"I know what it is. It's even funnier now because you felt like you had to explain it, you fuckin nerd"
Go do it again.  Don't be a quitter.  Except this time kick ass.    Everyone royally screws up.  Nothing to be ashamed of unless you walk away.
