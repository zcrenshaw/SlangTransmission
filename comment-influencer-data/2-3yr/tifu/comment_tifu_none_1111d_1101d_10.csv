"My god I feel for you OP. If it makes you feel any better I got told off for telling this joke in a church service: ""How do you make holy water? You boil the hell out of it.” Apparently the joke was too ""sensitive."""
Are you sure you can handle weed?
Did anyone else come here hoping for a sequel to the TIFU by pretending not to know what a potato is?
"This is not a fuck up, it's high quality justice porn. Feels good, man."
"Your mom took it to the face and she's alright with it. Nice. 

Congrats man!!"
I don't know him personally but I have a feeling Jack Black would not be upset about being an inspiration.
"&gt; Could the date have gone any worse? No.

Yep.  You just learned that this guy a) would try to comfort you, and b) will listen to your wishes, even if it's to leave.

Methinks you should treat him to a nice dinner and move forward."
Kick her down the stairs again... Clearly she didn't learn her lesson.
I get the feeling he'd either play along amazingly or he'd steal OP's job and teach the special kids how to play musical instruments and then take them to a heavy metal competition
"I'm a 23 year old bachelor, do you think that occurred to me???

Seriously, good point. "
"This is something I would pay my grand kids to do on purpose.
"
"Where you REALLY went wrong.. was when your apt starting smelling bad you just started opening the windows instead of looking for the source.


"
"Yeah, you didn't really pull the joke off properly. You're supposed to call yourself by your name. It's a Dad Joke because it's said by dads, not because you're pretending to be a dad.

Still, my sympathies to you. Everyone fucks up a joke every now and then, and yours just happened to have a terrible fallout."
"Similar story, except when I was 14 I drank a lot of my dad's rum a filled it back up with water, he never drank and it had just been up there literally collecting dust. Then when I was 20 and in the Navy, I got a phone call in my barracks and my dad was like ""Hey, weird question, but did you drink my Rum and fill it with water?"" I lost my shit laughing on the phone."
"So moral of the story is, always be suspicious of women approaching you first in Vegas"
"""Shit, someone has gone through all this trouble to keep me alive. Fuck them, I'll screw with their plans and commit suicide"""
Don't worry if you do get the job take your new boss out to lunch and pretend to not know what a potato is and your accent problem will soon be forgotten
so you vampire proofed your suitcase
potatoes have been causing a lot of problems recently according to reddit
"methinks 2 joints on a date is too much for a ""deciding date""."
Lol that's a good joke tho
"I guess you could say that joke...*puts on shades* misfired. YEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

EDIT: Thank you stranger for my first gold! I will name my first born kitten after you."
"Depending on the kink, playing footsies with a harlot's turd usually costs extra.   "
"He knew you had that reaction because of him, and you musn't be the only one. Everybody feels uncomfortable when the cops are about, they can penalize you pretty heavily; kind of like working with management looking at your every move (or that guy above management).  
  
You got to think that he sees people stamp the breaks on a regular basis, to lower their speed. Everybody most likely slow down when he's around, and that might even annoy him sometimes.  
  
Think of it this way. You probably made his day, and making somebody happy (even though not willingly) is not necessarily a bad thing at all."
I get the feeling he'd play along.

I can almost hear the rationalization behind this kind of damage control where you tell yourselves to just fuck it and book it, since this is all just going to be reduced to a memory anyway as you've made sure that there's no future left in it anymore."
"Guns don't kill people, potatoes kill people"
Bad move by mom to repeatedly call your phone if she thought you were in a school shooting situation.  Might have given away your hiding spot 
Really don't get how the mom would find it funny to watch her daughter's boyfriend jizz in his pants. 
He did. That's why he is already out of her life again.
What is a potato?
Only one way to find out. Roll two more. 
My porn collection was stored on a beast of a desktop computer.  I'd hate to think of that crashing through the ceiling onto my mom!
"Yeah, a few people definitely got a kick out of it, and it probably relieved some tension! Still super awkward though"
My roommates and I have banished the suitcase to a storage closet. The smell has permeated out of the suitcase and into the room. So the closet is now the garlic room.
He could probably smell the cum through the phone.

"I've commented about this before, but I learned (a variation) of this lesson when I was about 12ish. I saw my dad's bottle of coke on the counter and took a massive swig of it, only to find it was his spit bottle. I never touch a drink sitting out unless I am certain it is mine. "
Use canned air and a microfiber towel to clean. I just picked up some microfiber towels for cheap at the Home Depot.

That's what the $50 bought him. 
Splitting a joint is perfect for a decider date
"""Sir, before today I never heard of a potato."""
"I mean, that's one thing. I have open convos with my mother too, but I'm not telling her ""oh hey, we got SO a wireless vibrating butt plug, I'm gonna make SO wear it and make SO cum at lunch"" like wtf...that's weird as fuck"
You smoked two marijuanas. That was your mistake.  You NEVER smoke two whole marijuanas. 
"Last time I went, I collected as many as I could, and then my friends and I played cards with them. 

We would deal out a selection to each person, pick a superlative, and then do the rest CAH style, where each person submits one and the winner gets the superlative.

Of course we had most/least attractive, most likely to do anal, most likely to bring home to parents, most likely ""just doing this to pay for college"", and a bunch of others I don't remember.

10/10 would recommend as a drinking game.

EDIT: I just checked, and I still have either ""trashiest"" or ""most likely to have daddy issues"" tucked in the back of my wallet. Her name is Abbie, and she's sitting spread legged on a tricycle, with a lens flare over her cooter. She has pigtails, and a crop-top pulled down to show her tittays, and you can spend a night with her for the cheap price of $125! No hidden fees either!"
"I was at my friends house one time in high school and we decided we would drink some of his dads vodka that he kept in the freezer. Maybe went a bit overboard and replaced it with water... Funnily enough, it's a bit of a dead giveaway when your bottle of vodka freezes solid."
"Give him a brake,  it was probably auto correct. "
Oh daddy! I've missed you! Where have you been?

"My dad's funeral was nuts. They were supposed to play 'Ode to my Family' by the Cranberries. 


They played 'Zombie' instead. At a funeral. The funeral was on Halloween too. 


Then they played the slide show backwards. So you get to see my dad getting younger with each picture. Ending with his new born picture. 


I was pretty upset about it then. Now it's just a funny memory. My dad would have been amused. "
"Also hate to be *that* guy, but *your"
It's because it's a made up story
Would you say your chances of another date... went up in smoke? :-)
Canned air would go a long way towards getting it out of nooks and crannies 
It's not a joke if it's true. Source am holy water
"You would be surprises at the unreasonable and often insane things a mind on drugs comes up with. I used to do some when I was quite a bit younger. I took LSD once, then spent about an hour talking to a friend on my phone. 

It wasn't until that friend called one of the people that I was hanging out with that I realized my phone was actually off, and I'd been talking to myself for an hour. It was really weird..."
Maybe just don't smoke weed anymore?  It really isn't for everyone.

"My advice would be to say your own name instead of ""dad"" next time. But I don't think anyone should be upset with you, you didn't know the girl was fatherless."

"At least you didn't get a call from the school after your 6 y/o child wrote in their memory journal ""Mommy knocked my tooth out this weekend."" Accompanied by a crayon drawing of a toothless face and a blood puddle. 

I had been helping her brush her teeth the night before when a tooth that had been loose fell out into the sink... That was it."
How bad does it have to get down near the toilet bolts before you clean it? 
Something something every goddamn thread
the mistake was not making a cutting gesture to her throat while she was talking to the father

"My sister did that once, just casually walked by mom and told her that dad hit her without any explanation. I laughed and had to explain what happened to mom, because she was so confused.

"As former head lifeguard, fuck that guy. Our gym was connected to a hotel (but was a separate business). The gym had a deal with the hotel, where the hotel guests were allowed to use the facilities as a courtesy. They would get kid sports teams where the chaperones would try to drop the kids off and go drink at the hotel bar. The pool rule was so many adults per kid. We did constant head counts because the adults would try to sneak out. We would have to pull everyone out of the pool and send someone to the bar to fetch the chaprones and then listen to them bitch us out. When we closed for the night, one of the chaperones yelled at me and one of my guards ""what am I supposed to do with these kids the rest of the night?!"""
"I was once in the deep jungles of the Kenyan rainforest, and my Kenyan neighbor told me he could give me a ""cigarette that would make me laugh and want to run around""  So naturally my friend and I jump on this opportunity and smoke weed with this Kenyan farmer.  

For some reason my friend after this decides that a run through the jungle is the best course of action so we put on our running shoes and are out the door.  Now, although this is in the rainforest there are still a number of huts scattered throughout with small children who think it's the FUNNIEST thing to see two mzungus just running through the woods.  So naturally they all come out and run behind us shouting words at us in Swahili.

About 5 minutes into this run and I'm deeply regretting this decision.  I slow down and let my friend run ahead....only to realize that HOLY FUCK I have no idea where I am or where this path leads.  My only two friends are these two young Kenyan girls who are still following me.  I ask them which way the mzungu went and they point me further along the path and begin skipping telling me to follow them.

At this point the immense paranoia kicks in and I think these two girls are like those twins from the shining and are going to lead me to an ambush and murder me.  So I begin sprinting along this path, so of course they run behind me trying to catch up which only continues to fuel this intense fear.  I am running my absolute ass off as I eventually make it to the clearing to my house and my friend with all the other children and I realize how incredibly stupid I'm being.  

I proceed to smoke another j, watch the sunset and stare at the Kenyan stars for a few hours.  All in all I'd say worth it.

TL;DR Smoked some Kenyan grass and saw the girls from the shining. "
Maybe it's good you didn't sleep with her if she had that brewing already.

"So we now have:

2. Someone who forgot that he bought potatoes.

3. Someone who forgot about the potatoes.

"My wife and I bought our current house about 10 years ago. The former owners raised several boys before they all grew up and moved out.  

A few months after moving in, I was in the finished half of our basement, poking up ceiling tiles looking for a water shutoff.  Out came about 3 or 4 1980's-era Playboys. 
 
I showed them to my wife and she also thought it was pretty hilarious. Until  we started paging through one of the magazines, and found that many of the pages were stuck together. For the reason you would think.  I was never more grossed out."
"Firstly, you have my sympathies, young man.  You took a bad hit.  Secondly, I would like to suggest that at the end of each month we vote F.U. of the month.  Thirdly, I would like to nominate you as ""F.U. of the month""'s first award."

"Wow, that's awesome. I had a similar scenario happen when my parents and I moved, the year I started high school. I had a small collection of porn, pilfered from my best friend's dad (who had enough to never know the difference), hidden in my closet. Fairly well hidden, I may add. The thing is, our house sold about a week earlier than anticipated, and we had to rush through the final stages of moving out, and my parents wisely decided a full-service moving company was the way to go. Less wise, though, was the decision not to give me the heads up to start packing.

So, there I am, 13 years old, and these strangers are in the house, packing our shit, and it dawns on me that I need to either dispose of, or hide, all my nudey mags, so I go to my room. One of the supervisors sends a mover behind me to help, not knowing what I'm up to, and it just happened to be the only woman on the crew. So, I'm in my closet, pulling out these well-loved Playboy magazines, and right behind me, I hear ""Here, I'll get that!"" and everything in my hands is suddenly in her grasp. 

You know in cartoons, when two people are tugging on either end of something, and then somehow it flies up in the air? Yeah, that happened. And I'm left there, standing eye to eye with this woman, with my collection of late 90's porn mags at our feet, deciding what the most efficient means of killing myself might be.

Thankfully, she was just as mortified as I, and just kinda dumped everything into a box, piled some clothes on it, taped it up, and loaded it. I avoided her the rest of the day, using the excuse that I was saying goodbye to my friends. 

We arrived in our new house a few days later and I burned every scrap of those magazines as soon as I could. There was no powering through that shame, not even at 13 years old."

"That's my solution now, but at the time, the only PC in the house was communal, and in my mom's room. By the time I saved up enough to build my first beastly PC, the collection was already 4 years old, and I was set to move out in a month or so.

"I remember a news story about something similar that went horribly wrong. 

Young girl (3 or 4?) told her teacher, in tears, that ""daddy put him pee-pee in my pee-pee"". Things so totally off the rails, CS gets involved, child is removed from the house and on and on, takes a year or more to clear up, I think the guy was even formally charged at one point.

What happened? Kid was a little neurotic, and was upset because her father peed in the toilet after she did without flushing. I heard this story shortly after my oldest was born, and he was definitely told the real names for body parts, not ambiguous pet names!"

This is such an overrated philosophy. This gets you focusing on the 1% douche tools who make your life hell, while ignoring everyone else because they don't make a fuss.

Sometimes they leave unhappy, and you're fucking grateful they never come back. 

I should note, ""making it right"" for a customer when things go wrong is totally acceptable. Trying to appease completely unreasonable assholes only encourages more to come to your door. And they aren't even really ""customers"" because they usually want to come out ahead. Just let them go.

"In your post you say you wanted to lose 0.5 kg each week, and you have lost 0.6875 kg per week in four months (11kg in 16 weeks?), which means that you miscalculated the daily calories by maybe 200 calories. Either that or you made a mistake when counting calories or activity.

If your TDEE is was 2500, and you only ate 1000, you would expect to at least drop 20 kilos. 25 kilos if not accounting for the reduced body mass and increased sleep.

If losing 0.7 kg a week have made you sick, ill and depressed it may be advisable to seek medical advice before making similar dietary changes."

"&gt; Okay, so I posted this yesterday, but my formatting was all kinds of fucked up so they took it down. 

&gt;Anyway here's the story: So I'm the general manager at an upscale(ish) Japanese steakhouse. The kind of place where they do the hibachi grill in front of you and charge you $20 for a plate that's 75% rice. Anyway, it's Friday night. We're balls to the wall busy and, like most restaurants on a Friday night, everything is generally chaos. I currently don't have an assistant manager, so at any one time I'm doing 8,000 different things by myself. 

&gt;So fast forward to the peak of our rush tonight. We have a group of 25 eight year olds show up to eat for one of the little fuckers birthdays. That's 25 eight year olds that are being supervised by 4 adults... In other words it's pretty much my worst fucking nightmare. So I'm running around trying to make sure the other 150+ customers are being taken care of while all these prepubescent little shits are treating my restaurant like its a god damn chuck e cheeses. Meanwhile the 4 adults are at the bar drinking, presumably because they've been put in charge of 25 demonic hell spawns. At this point I'm so busy that I don't even have time to be concerned about these little demons or the worthless parents that should be trying to control them. 

&gt;I'm standing in the lobby when I see a waitress flag me down from across the room. I'm making my way through the crowd that's amassed in the lobby and I'm moving at a pretty brisk pace. Suddenly I have one of the hostesses behind me shout me name and I do very abrupt 180 to turn around and see what they need. It was in this 180 turn that apparently I forgot how to control my arms. I turned around so quickly that my arm swung out in a weird kind of sweeping arc and the large faced, very heavy, metal watch that was on my wrist makes the most solid contact imaginable with this eight year olds forehead. I hit that kid so hard I half expected someone to pop out of the crowd and yell ""WORLDSTAR!"". My watch actually cut the kid when it hit him, so he's laying on the ground bawling and bleeding everywhere, I'm just standing there staring at the kid in shock, and the kids dad (who just happened to be one of the 4 adults) has now left the bar and is making a bee-line right for me and his concussed 8 year old. 

&gt;The guy immediately gets in my face and starts screaming at me for hitting his kid. At this point I'm still trying to be all about customer service and I'm trying to calmly and politely explain that it was an accident and I'm extremely sorry. The dad continues to be a massive asshole, accusing me of assaulting a child and threatening to call the police. Finally I just snapped. I always treat customers with respect and kindness even when they're being belligerently douchey, but I just couldn't deal with this guy. I blow up on him, and ask him what kind of shitty father sits at a bar drinking while a horde of children he's responsible for run around a restaurant unsupervised. I tell him that if he gave a shred of a shit about his kid he would've been watching him and this never would've happened. At this the father becomes irate. He starts screaming about what a shitty restaurant we are and about what a shitty manager I am. He grabs his kid (who's still crying and bleeding) by the arm, yanks him off the ground and proceeds to storm outside, streaming a slew of profanity as he leaves. 

&gt;About 15 minutes pass when suddenly two police officers walk in with this guy riding their coat tails like he's hot shit. The police come to question me and they're very curious as to why I ""would punch a child in the face"". I explain to them it was all a complete accident and a total misunderstanding. I explain how everything was caught on the restaurants security cameras and I'd be happy to show them the footage. They watched it, agreed that it was a total accident, and cleared me of any wrong doing. When the cops go to leave without me in handcuffs the father becomes absolutely furious and starts screaming at me and the police officers in the middle of the lobby. The cops begin to explain to the man he needs to calm down before they're forced to do something. This makes him even more mad. Then I mention to the police officers how the guy never paid for the drinks he had at the bar and how he just walked out on his tab. (Now I realize I may have caused brain damage to his child and I probably could've just let him have the drinks to compensate, but fuck that guy.) 

&gt;When I accuse the guy of walking out on his tab it becomes too much for his insignificant little mind to bare and he snaps. He lunges at me, swings, and totally misses. I jump out of the way as the cops take the guy down and slap the handcuffs on him. The police then dragged him out the front door while he was screaming at everyone he could possibly scream at and that was the last we saw of him. At least for tonight anyway.

&gt; TL,DR: I run a restaurant. Large group of unsupervised little shits show up. 8 year old little shit's not paying attention to me, I'm not paying attention to him. In a whirlwind of fast paced movement my large metal watch collides with his face and basically knocks him the fuck out. Little fucker's shit stick of a father flips out. Chaos ensues.

There ya go!"

I used to feel fluffy happy and fuzzy and then one day it just stopped and paranoia set in constantly. The worst thing is that I continued to smoke with my friends like twice a week because they told me to just relax and it will be fine. I'd have legit weed induced panic attacks twice a week because I didn't want to be that guy to pass on a hit. 
"Reminds me of when my oldest was in Kindergarten. One day I picked him up &amp; the teacher asked to speak to me alone for a minute. She then proceeded to show me a picture my kid drew that day that showed a smaller person being hit with rocks by a bigger person. When asked to explain the picture my kid said ""grandpa likes to hit me with rocks"". They were understandably concerned. I had to explain that his grandfather made up a game with the grandkids: it's basically a pillow fight but 1 of them is a monster &amp; the rest throw ""rocks"" at the ""monster"". "
