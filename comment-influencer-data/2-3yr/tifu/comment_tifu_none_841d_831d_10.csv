"Holy shit how Canadian can one man be? Former  hockey player and too polite to bother fucking 911 after dislocating your kneecap TWICE?!

Stranger: TIFU by walking
Tell her she's now famous on the front page of Reddit. That'll win her back
"There's one right beside the emerge clinic so.... Yes actually. 

Lol"
"Fantasy: ""That would've been smooth AF.""

Reality: ""That's really presumptive and creepy of you.""


Edit: It's official: My highest rated comment is about being creepy. That seems about right. Also, thanks for the anonygild"
You are the reason most modern mowers shut off when you let go off the handle. Thanks a lot.
"Awesome for your confidence going forward, bummer about the iPhone. What did you do after it happened? "
Should have set up her replacement phone to include your phone number in it already. 
I appreciate the simplicity of this TIFU
Company insure chipped in and I also had to fork out some money to get her a refurbished iPhone. You just can't replace motherboards with IPhones. 
"This is honestly the most sincere and innocent FU I've ever read. I'm so sorry.
Good luck with your bum."
TIFU By being so hot that I burned expensive phone parts
That was your risky 'thick white substance' tasting of the day. I salute your dedication to tasting the Oreo cream and hope you get to experience it one day :)
"I'm in Greece right now visiting family, thank you for teaching me the lesson you learned. "
"Holy fucking shit, he even made a post 4 days ago asking if Lobsters are affected by Freshwater vs Saltwater.

"That would've been smooth AF.

Edit: Hi there, penis people! Chill out--this is Reddit. If you're looking here for actual girl advice, you're in the wrong subreddit. Fucking duh. Also, I'm female, but I'll steal your girl anyway because y'all clearly don't know how to talk to them.

I didn't think it needed to be said, but please don't actually do this. Fucking hell, guys. Does everything really need a sarcasm tag?"
"i can clearly visualize you vigorously hammering your testes onto the concrete.

You come out of the bathroom 5 minutes later, everyone asks why the fuck your covered in blood.

""Oh dont worry im just on my period its kool."""
"""Honey! Get in here and see this! Your cooter is famous now!"""
"""I didn't say anything to not give him a reason to assault me further."""
"&gt;I waved the plush penis around.
&gt;
&gt;Still no response.

That's when you know it's bad, kids. "
You are so beautifully Canadian holy shit. Did you apologize when you got to the clinic for fucking up your knee and bothering them? hahaha
Apologize for breaking her phone and offer to make it up to her with dinner.
"It's a LPT, TIL, and TIFU all in one. "
You should've climbed High Hrothgar instead no fees guaranteed

**Edit:** Wow, gold? Thanks, guys! I never realized my most upvoted comment would be wharrgarbl  wharrgarbl  wharrgarbl  wharrgarbl  wharrgarbl doink "
You should become some type of fist based superhero... The iron fister? 
"Just enter it as ""Cell Phone Repair Guy"". That way it's not creepy. You put it in there in case she needs your services again. Or other ""services"" you provide.

Haemorrhoids at 17 was enough for me to feel a whole world's worth of pity. And then the molten copper! Poor kid.
"Wait... nobody has EVER told me about this part of a washing machine... I've been doing laundry for 18 years and... well, fuck. I'm going to pretend I didn't see this, were buying a new washing machine soon enough anyway..."
"Fuck me I actually do that all the time. I once apologized for wasting their time as I was totally covered in blood. They assured me I wasn't, but I wasn't totally convinced. "
Mine has said handle. Causes me back pain to clear it without turning it off. But we shall overcome.
"I think what we're asking by ""worth it"" is if you got a date out of it. "
"I had something similar happen to me. I was at a wedding in Nova Scotia and when it came time to make the ~18 hr drive back to Toronto we stopped at a market and ended up buying a live lobster- planning on eating him. But he was just so cool that halfway home I had already decided to try and keep him. He was on ice in the back seat of our car but seemed to be doing ok. Unlike you, I happened to have a relatively empty and large saltwater aquarium at home. So we got home, I got him some mussels etc to eat and he lived with us happily for maybe 6 months. His name was Bob. 

One day I came home only to find Bob unresponsive in his tank. Seemed like he was dead, but upon doing some Internet research apparently if the tail was still springy it was still good to eat. 

So we ate poor Bob. Lol it was exactly like that scene in the Simpsons. "
Least nsfw nsfw post I've read in a while 
"That was both a night to remember and forget. 

Head Trauma. 

*Edit* My top comment has to do with a plush penis and an epileptic. Good day. "

"When I was about 6, on a family vacation to the Sea, we stopped in a seafood restaurant.  I loved the lobsters in the aquariums.  Big brother and big sister were arguing; i didn't know what about.  Dad says to me "" You pick a Lobster."" I had no idea, when I pointed to my  new best lobster friend in the tank, that I was actually singling him out for a fast boil.  20 minutes later, when the lid was lifted, I turned green and almost passed out.  He was such nice friendly Lobster.... "
Good for you all for calling an ambulance right away! Too many horror stories these days of people getting hurt at college parties and no one doing anything until it's too late.

"Opposite of this:  Was in the grocery store.  Lady comes up and comments on how attractive I am.  I say ""thanks, I like to take care of myself.""  Her smile disappears as she says, ""no, your baby is very handsome. Not you.""

"Haha! It was pretty similar. I was debating telling Hailey at the time, but I just decided on leaving a simple ""I will explain later, and I am in pain."""
"I am a close friend of OP, he did not make this up. My friend is a crazy person for believing he had a connection to a Blue Lobster. I support the care he gave the Lobster but not the reasoning behind it. Also I am a little high so some of what I said may not make sense or does, I am not sure."
"Yeah that's how I imagined the world ending too... With a bunch of people from Pompeii holding cell phones in the air. On volcano day.

"It's more that normal fish get a quick kill, life is taken and that is it. Boiling is an elongated and otherwise terrible death. Creatures from the sea, especially cool snip snap monsters deserve a quick death.

"Holy shit, I finally know what happened!  Reddit strikes again!  Here's a little story of my own.  Burnsville, MN, September 2006.  I'm working as a junior System Operator at Black Dog Generating Station.  It's about 12:15 and I'm just settling in for the graveyard when I see a flag come up on the computer.  There's this random-ass drop on one of the HV mains somewhere out by Farmington.  I'm scratching my head wondering what could be causing this and if it's something I should report when everything goes fucking apeshit.  Suddenly this random spot where there shouldn't even be anything is fluctuating like crazy from looking like it just got hit by lightning to looking like it's running a goddamn particle accelerator.  At this point I'm split 50/50 between some kind of random-ass software bug on the computer's end or the goddamn Martians landing in the Minneapolis suburbs, either way I figure I better call my boss.  By the time he picks up the phone and I start trying to explain what I'm seeing, it's all over.  Everything is back to normal and I'm left trying to explain to the senior engineer that the new guy didn't just fuck up reading the computer.  Until today, I never knew what had caused that.  God, that was the strangest thing I had ever seen on the job since 1998 when Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell in a Cell and plummeted 16 feet through an announcer's table.

"Hey, I've done that climb. I didn't get in either, but that's because our tour bus arrived late and so by the time the group of us got up to the top it was dark and it was closed. There's a pretty good picture of us all essentially throwing ourselves at the door wailing because we couldn't get in. 

It was way harder to climb down, though cause it was super dark. 

It was worth it, though, cause its a pretty good story."
You are covered in blood at the ER/Clinic and you're worried about them wasting their time trying to fix you? (literally what the ER/Clinic and doctors in general are for?) ARE YOU ALSO CANADIAN WTF

"My sister grabbed a pitcher of what she thought was orange juice and started to drink straight from the container.  I knew Mom had poured grease from the deep fat fryer into there, not OJ, so I yelled at her to stop.

Typical little sis interpreted this as ""don't drink from the pitcher, you filthy pig"" and not ""there's something disgusting in there"", then proceeded to make a show of licking the spout and chugging a huge mouthful."

"You really did do your best, OP! I'm a wildlife rehabber and we once got a call from a man quite far up north our province who was a construction worker. He had found a baby mouse all alone on a construction site and called our hotline, asking if one of our vets could take him. He was about 6 hours away from our main city, but we've partnered vet offices across the province to take in wildlife. Unfortunately, he was about three hours from the nearest vet. We told him that we highly appreciate his call and caring heart, but the only vet around is three hours away. Much to our surprise, he said ""no problem!"" and *drove three hours on northern Canada roads to take an orphaned baby mouse to the vet.* Normally, the vet would have raised the mouse then fed it to an injured owl (circle of life, sorry) but the vet raised the little mouse and released him the forest. 
It was so sweet to see some hardy northern construction worker care so much for a little mouse!"

"LPT: if your nail starts to throb, it's from a buildup of pressure from a bleed under the nail which is trapped with nowhere to go. Make a small hole into your nail where it's throbbing by gently rolling a sharp pin back and forth with a bit of pressure. Heating it with a lighter helps, but is optional. The blood will be released and the throbbing pain will be gone instantly. It's not as scary as it sounds to drive a pin through your nail. Just do it, you won't regret."

"It looked rather like a substation got sick into the back of a truck, and then a mad scientist tried to build it up as a coal-fired death ray by gloming parts of a German tank on the remains. It was gunmetal grey, black, with tanks strapped together with rope, chain, and tow cables of many colors holding it all together. It took us two days with sledgehammers and acetylene torches to pull the leaking and scorched remains apart after. It shit mineral oil, tin foil, and scraps of metal every bump we hit on the unlit dirt roads. We felt like we were dragging the remains of chernobyl through the countryside that night. a few times the residual charge let off a crack of smoke and light. We left it parked in the field for a week before we started... enough crackling from an angry thunder god on the sideroads home was a strong indicator that while the equipment was ruined, the capacitors were still intact enough to kill anyone who touched one of the leads. That's how long it would take for the remaining charge to go flat. Everything it shit out of that trailer during that week killed everything on the ground nearby. Safety first!"
"Oh, jeez. 

I've done something similar if it makes you feel better.

"I consider myself highly empathetic but... that.... that's not normal. Are your hormone levels okay? You might want to seriously get some testing done. That level of emotion is literally robbing you of control over your life and decision-making. I think the problem may be physical/medical, not just psychological. I have literally never even heard of anyone being so **enslaved** (yep, seriously) by their emotional state. Go soon. It could be something small and easily fixable. It could make your life a thousand times better if you just knew. Don't put it off till next week. Go soon.
