"Hey, at least you actually got an interview out of it! Good luck :)"
And you made this post to further cover up your infidelity. Nice job. 
Yep that's a fuck up. Like such a stupid fuck up. I hope you poop it soon. It was also very funny.
"Well I later received a letter from the DA asking for my account as an eyewitness, but I did not get into real trouble except for being handcuffed on the ground in a public place for half an hour. So, I'd do it again :D"

"This happened to me once, but I actually got the job.

Our town has two meijers in it. One of them had open interviews. When I heard about it, I assumed it was the one closer to me, so I slapped on a tie and went up there.

When I got in there, a manager was giving the greeter a break, and I asked her where the open interviews were, but she knew nothing about it. She ended up calling the general manager and he said it was at the other store. I felt pretty stupid.. lol. Anyway, I was walking out and the manager called me back and said she actually had an opening in her department and interviewed me on the spot, and I nailed it.

Fun fact: the woman who hired me is my wife now"

STOP FUCKING SMOKING DUDE, PLEASE. Do you know what its like to wake up in the middle of the night gasping for breath and sweating because you can't breathe? Know what its like to get winded from taking a shower? A fucking shower?

Stop, please dude just stop. Fuck the money you could save, your lungs will die and they will never be what they could have been. Cigarettes are fucking useless poison and should be fucking illegal in and out. I say this as Im lighting one up. 

Please, please, please just quit while you're ahead. Really dude, please just quit. Fuck tobacco, fuck the cigarette companies, fuck all of it. Please stop smoking cigarettes, they ***WILL*** fuck your life up.

Oh, and thats not mentioning the phlegm tahts always in my throat. Always, 24/7. Theres always something to cough up or slide down my throat into my stomach. Always phlegm, always always always. I have to blow my nose every 5 minutes and sometimes it just makes me puke because the phlegm is in my esophagus and not my trachea, so its hitting my gag reflex almost 24/7.

Do. Not. Smoke. Cigarettes. Please I'm fucking begging you.

E: Maybe a bit late to edit this in, but I've tried vaping on all sorts of different ecigs and dedicated rigs, and I still intend to quit myself. Thanks for your help but I don't need another suggestion to try vapes lol, 40 is enough."

"Clearly they are cops wearing blankets everywhere hence the origin of the phrase ""under the covers"". Not many know that the phrase's true origin from the word ""undercover"" though. If you ask me, I think it is a shitty way to catch criminals as you can spot the blanket from a mile away which also spawned another well known term ""Pigs in a Blanket"". Pigs in a blanket may often be a popular dish though the origin was from a chef who hated officers and wanted to mock the officer but the officer actually loved the dish. Word spread among undercover officers that's pigs in a blanket was the go to dish at any diner and that is how pigs in a blankets became as well known as it is today."
OP delivers!
I went to pet my cat last week and she was smelling like perfume. That was a first. I assumed a neighbor must have been all perfumed up and pet her on the way out. My cat is cheating on me...

I'm willing to bet this is an inside job - some random guy off the street isn't going to know that is where you store your applications and wouldn't be looking to steal applications in the first place. You have any recently fired employees that may have a beef with the company that were aware of where the applications were kept?
"My son was laying on his stomach play  legos in the living room. He lets out a scream and is holding his ""private area."" He's in obvious pain. I ask ""What's wrong? What happened?"" I think he may have smooshed his penis. A couple minutes of trying to comfort him and him wailing go by. I decide I need to take a look because he isn't calming down. I pull down his shorts and his penis was gone. It looks like a bellybutton. ""OH MY GOD! WHAT THE FUCK!"" I'm panicking on the inside but trying to keep it cool for him.  Now he is in pain and freaking out. Should I call the doctor? Should I call his dad? It's hard being a mom sometimes.

Mistake 3: Not owning up to your parents. OK - let us say mistake 2 happened because you were freaked out and ran. Now, you've had a little time to calm down, you're confronted by your parents - assuming a decent relationship, then at least they'll probably believe your story, so great - now you have an advocate!

Mistake 4 ? I think at this point you're in too deep and probably now I'd just advise you to stick to your lie and deny everything. The power of denial is real! Admit nothing!


but - next time, just remember, unless you're lying about a crime that's going to see you locked up in jail for all of time regardless of whether you admit your guilt or not,  generally speaking it's just going to compound your problems if you lie about such things (unless you're certain you can get away with it)"

"The intention was good! I also tried to have good intentions and stop a theif once... I was walking home from a frends house early hours in the morning after drinking, when i saw a dude climb over a garden fence and re-appear a minute later on a bike. Without too much thought i assumed he had just stolen it from the arden and was making a getaway so i started to chase him. He spotted me running and picked up speed but we were approaching a steep hill going up so I started to catch up quickly, when i was just about to grab him he threw the bike on the floor and sprinted off. I picked up the bike happy in the knowledge I had just done a good deed. As it was late I decided to take the bike back to the house I saw him 'steal' it from the following day. When i knocked on the door with the bike, I was met with shock and accusations that I had stolen it so I explained it wasn't me but I saw someone else steal it and got it back for them. They told me that the bike was taken during a street robbery when their Son was chased so he gave up the bike he had just collected from his own back garden!! Oops."

There is no good explanation for being scared of a child-sized person.  Your explanation is shit, and you need to come up with a better one. How about, you were running, it was dark, you didn't see her, and ran into her face? The problem with your current explanation is that you literally saw a little girl in a public park and clocked her.  
The fact that it's dark just makes that particular scenario worse, because you're an adolescent male and that just makes you look like you're up to no good from the get-go.

"That was a cool tale.

I played in a band once that rehearsed in an area of the town where the hookers prowled. The cops put a sting team together, and busted guys right on the street (took their vehicles, too: a Limo got impounded one night).

You could always tell the cop pretending to be a hooker, as she was good looking, wholesome, and clear-eyed, unlike most of the other tired girls.  There were three of them and we called them collectively Chastity, as they could get a car out of you without even so much as a kiss.

One night we were pulling up to park on the street and Chastity was soliciting a car with three guys that had pulled over and blocked our drive. I saw her give the hand signal, at which 3 cars plus a couple of undercovers dressed as homeless came screaming in. 

THe guy in the car hit reverse, but we had unwittingly pulled in behind him, blocking his escape.

One of the cops came over and said: thanks guys, what unit are you with?
