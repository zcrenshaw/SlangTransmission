I am the famous butthole gluer! Proud to have my TIFU spawn another TIFU.
Yeah you fucked up but it's not your fault that they cancelled the trips. That you can blame the kids that got drunk on a school trip. 
"Ahh, this is my shining moment.

I had literally played with fire. I use men's Nair hair removal to get rid of my hair on my junk, bunk, and bunkhole. It's real simple and I do it all the time with no discomfort.

But this one time I ate a ridiculous Mary Jane edible I created. For whatever reason I start wondering the house endlessly finding things to do and I thought, Nair time!

Got to the bathroom and do my typical routine and touch up on everything including my bunkhole. You are supposed to wait 5 minutes or so, but then I noticed that my mirror was dirty. I was like, I'm in high time right now, 10 minutes will seem like 2 minutes and I can clean these mirrors in 10 minutes which will really only be 2 minutes.

Run out of the bathtoom, looking for the windex and I can't find this shit. Like I start looking everywhere so I start looking in random drawers and it's no where. I get desperate and start looking in the fridge and I saw Chile habanero hot sauce. So I pull out an entire can of diced tomatoes and load it up with hot sauce and just start going bum on a ham sandwich on it. It was soooo, good after I put pepper on it.

Then I sat down and watched TV and I felt the underneath of my junk and bunkhole burning and I was like, fuck fuck fuck shit I forgot about the Nair. I ran to the bathroom and dived into the shower to rub this shit off. I had like 3rd degree burns everywhere and couldn't touch myself for at least a week. I got out of the shower and realized,

The damn windex was in the bathroom the entire time.

Edit: thank you for reddit gold friends!"
"The elf circled yes, but the elf would have to be magical to be able to circle the word. This is a paradox people."

"As a once teenage dude, awesome. As a father of three girls, not so much. üòê"
Yes eventually.  This was never a subject we discussed again.  However it was made much more difficult to have alone time.  Which is kind of funny because we obviously didn't need to be alone.... 
"I was honestly sucked into the situation.  

Edit: Thanks for the gold! "
Agreed
"Oh... Oh my god. I just realized that the parents had to be painfully aware that their young daughter had just swallowed a load. Where else would it have gone? Jesus Christ, the agony for everyone in that car ride..."
I'm now a father of a daughter. I completely concur. 
looking for windex has never before been such a pain in the ass
Dated the girl for four more years.  I was a carefree adolescent.

"I've got another traumatizing small children at Christmas story. 

My mom is a kindergarten teacher and she always shows her class The Polar Express before Christmas break. And they send the kids home with a goodie bag with candy and a little toy and a jingle bell. (If you haven't seen the movie **spoilers** the main character picks up a jingle bell from santas sleigh and can't hear it ringing until he truly believes in Santa). So the day is over all the kids have gone home, mom is cleaning up and comes across a few extra jingle bells. As she's putting them away she notices they don't have the little ball inside that makes them jingle.

EDIT: obligatory thanks for my first gold edit. "

"As soon as I read ""free couch"" and ""TIFU"" together I thought bedbugs! hahaha

You can identify bedbug bites from their linear pattern. It's said they bite in groups of 3 for ""breakfast, lunch and dinner"".

Their bites typically look like this:

http://dalatias.skinsight.com/info/files/image_upload/bb66925.JPG

They bite, you scratch, they move on slightly and bite again, you scratch... etc etc

This is typical:

Really easy to identify typical bedbug bite patterns. As soon as you see sets of bites like this you should be thinking ""BEDBUGS??!! ZOMG NOOOO!!!"""
"That's adorable. She must have thought ""jeez what a ripoff this spa is!"". At any point did she ask if she was in the right place or anything? Or did she just go along with whatever you asked her to do? Poor lady could have been in serious trouble if a not-so-nice person ran into her first. But now you both have a hilarious story to tell. 

Also if you want to share the picture try imgur, or photobucket (I think that site is still around, I used to use it)."
Did you ever encounter the dad post car blowjob. 
They were real tired of pudding up with your shit OP

Plot twist: You're home schooled.
It's like in the movies where the whole plot is based on one misunderstanding that could have been fixed if they would've just talked it out and explained the situation.
Not sure. Much more aggressively I imagine.

"I have a similar story. 

My sister had a problem with her new puppy chewing everything, and I told her that the smell of peppermint oil is a reasonable deterrent for pets. However, dogs noses are extremely sensitive, so I told her to mix the peppermint oil with water at least 50 to 1 in a spray bottle. She decided 50 - 1 didn't sound strong enough so she mixed it one to one and sprayed the whole bottle on everything in her house lower than 3 feet. 

Big mistake. 

She then proceeded to wash down every surface  she had sprayed and she still had to leave every window in the house open for the next 2 days. 

I went over two days after she did this and the house smelled like somebody blew up a candy cane factory."

"A couple of fun facts about your fuck up:

Visual processing happens on the order of tens to a hundred ms. Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8632824

The motor neurons which activate your arms conduct impulses at a velocity of about 150 m/s and may have only needed to travel about 1 meter, because a reflex arc can occur in your spinal cord and doesn't have to actually travel through/from your brain.
Sources: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10921/
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_motor_neuron

You probably reacted and struck that stupid kid in less than 2 tenths of second, if you acted reflexively. Combine that with the fact that the brain does a lot of nifty post-processing of memory (which is why eye-witness testimony can be unreliable: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4183265/) and it's likely that you didn't have any control over the event at all. To your memory the events may have happened like this: Person jumps out, you hear the yell, you see the person, you strike, person falls, you see its a teenager. When really the event probably went something like this: Person jumps out, you strike, person falls, you hear the person (actually register the sound), you see the person (actually register the ""attack""), you see its a teenager.

The brain is a neat organ, and reflexes are crazy fast for science reasons. In my mind, its not a fuck up if you didn't have conscious input in the situation. Yeah it sucks for the kid, and good on ya for empathizing, but it doesn't sound like you did anything wrong.

PS: PTSD can be hard. Keep on pushing to get better, and don't worry about reaching out to someone when you need support."
"Ironically, it has taken many years of maturing to be able to finally say I could now relate to their bf/gf situation, and that's what bf/gf do, so just be cool about it. If I brought him along on the trip because he was my daughter's boyfriend, I've already tacitly given my approval or at least acceptance of them doing bf/gf things, so it would be hypocritical of me to react. I can now finally see how my dad was able to do the same for me.

When I was 16, my dad drove me and my very first girlfriend to a Chicago concert and came back and picked us up afterwards. On the drive back home from the concert, she and I started necking in the back seat. She took my hand and pressed it against her chest to encourage me and then pushed my hand under her shirt so I could squeeze her big boobs better. Suddenly I came out of my fog of delight and realized where I was and I looked up to see my dad wink at me in his rear view mirror, which he then very obviously redirected out of the way so we could have some privacy. I thought my dad was the coolest dad on the planet but I did not expect that to go so well."

"So I've been with my SO for about five and a half years. You really learn a lot about a person in that amount of time so we have little to no secrets from each other.

Just the other day, I was browsing Reddit while my SO was playing video games and I come across an interesting post. I usually like going through the comments because, well, sometimes the comments are just way better than the post to begin with. Anyway, I notice a particular thread of comments that started with a particular (and as it seems, a very popular) user and all the comments on this thread go along the lines of ""hey, it's you again"" or ""I just saw you on this other post"". Even I recognized the name and I haven't been on Reddit that long so I think that's saying something. So I kinda chuckle at it and my SO gets curious and asks what's up. I just kinda laugh and say ""it's just funny how everyone knows iLickAnalBlood... Wait no, that's terrible, ewwww!""

SO just stared at me with the most disgusted and surprised face that could be put on and says ""I didn't know that about you"" and starts cracking up!

Ugh! I felt so nasty... Thanks a lot u/iLickAnalBlood"
Please never drive yourself to the hospital if you believe you may be suffering something as serious as a heart attack. Likewise if you're with someone whose in such a situation don't let them drive themselves.
That's because at that age you haven't learned to quadruple-dog-dare yet.
Really? I just grunted 
So TIL I should go to Japan more often and hang out with the awesome old people!
"I'm confused as to why your girlfriend didn't say anything sooner? I mean, leaving it hanging like that for a minute is just asking for it. "
"I did this once as well. Except with sweet orange oil. My boyfriend had gotten me this set of like 6 different oils for an oil diffuser, but I thought an orange scented bath sounded nice.

After about 5 minutes of the water feeling hotter and hotter I jumped out and called for my boyfriend. The burning didn't go away once I was out of the bath, however.

The internet told him a good way to get rid of the burning would be to add olive oil, so as he laughed and poured olive oil down my ass crack he told me all about how orange oil is commonly used as a paint stripper."
Sounds like you hate your job

"Honestly I don't care at all.  I hope my daughter has as much fun wherever she chooses as I did when I was sneaking around as a teen.  She's got an implant contraceptive and she's paranoid about stds, she also understands that other people may not have the same opinions as I do however.

Her sexuality isn't my property,  it's kind of creepy for dads to be so possessive about it imo anyway."
"I like how he claimed he ""almost"" kidnapped her. There is no ""almost"" about it."
"Can confirm, am female and have done the same."

"Come to Colorado. The weed will make you forget you have an ass to Nair.

EDIT: I'm loving the variations of ""I've never been to X, but the weed can't possibly be as good as it is in Y"" posts. 

What a thing to get into a pissing match about. 

Let's just settle on ""weed is strong now."""
"My iphone screen is screwed up too, and I live in constant fear of this happening.

Too much of a cheapskate to fix it though."
I Dog^6 you!
"That's not too bad. I had a professor make a joke in a class once, and I referenced the joke at the end of the period, but somehow he seemed to forget he'd even made it in the first place...and thought I was trying to humiliate him? The guy ended up turning red in the face screaming at me to leave his class. So at least your prof didn't...y'know...lose his mind?"
"In China the banknotes have Mao on them, and I accidentally put one through the washing machine. When I took my clothes out, I saw the note had somehow perfectly folded itself up to just show Mao's face staring up at me from the back of the machine. "
A doubly good language to learn since half of OP's family is Japanese.
"&gt;OP, I think you got off easy.

He did say it only took about three minutes."
"My dad used to pay me to eat hot peppers out of the garden. The real trick to getting rid of capsaicin is chips. Ideally a small stack of Pringles, but even a handful of any chip or even heavily salted bread in a pinch. Just put it in your mouth and press your tongue to the roof of your mouth, and it wills dry out your mouth, drawing out the capsaicin oil in the process. Learned this by trial and confirmed in Chem class later. "
Someone with half a million in student loan debt and no choice in life but to work in an urgent care clinic had to pluck your taint. Learn to see this as a form of wealth and power. 
"That's awesome, I love the cop saying ""can I say that?"" lol. I lived in a place somewhat similar to what you described, and we had a lot of fun doing stuff like this. Never did get caught, but we used to push our luck. Before any of us had a car, when we were around 14 years old, we used to walk around and simply pull mailboxes off of their posts with our hands... not as fun as using a baseball bat, though."
You're fucked dude. Those were given to me by the Dalai Lama!

"While I may have given them ""approval"", I wouldn't have given them approval to suck dick behind my back (literally). I wouldn't see it hypocritical of me to react, seeing that is is a lack of respect for me on their part."
OP should be on the lookout for a poor Yelp review.
I'd gladly take a six-figure salary for plucking asshole hair.
Or don't! Tell her the job fell through and you were homesick and realized you'd love the opportunity. No need to tell the full story.
"When I dropped my iphone into dirty water mixed with old coffee granules, I immediately turned it off and put it in a bag of silica gel satchels and dry rice, air tight, for a **week**. 

It worked fine for me for at least a year after that. Until I forgot it in a cab."

"OP, Dale might have a crush on you."
"I believe I know what happens next...


OP meets the love of his life on Tinder.
He's already deep in the feels before he realises it's his bosses wife.
She reveals that his boss is actually an abusive scumbag.
OP realises evil boss was just using the tinder thing as an excuse to place blame on somebody else.
By this point evil boss man has already fired OPs ass.
But, of course, OP is actually a genius when it comes to divorce law.
He becomes the ex wife's lawyer and they take evil boss to court for everything he owns (including said law firm).
However ex wife to be finds out it was actually OP who was responsible for the tinder thing and thinks he was helping her husband cheat on her all along.
OP makes a climatic final argument in the court case which has everybody in tears.
The judge rules in the ex wife's and OPs favour.
OP turns round and sees ex wife is gone, just as police officers storm the court to arrest evil husband boss for the abuse and some financial fraud to boot.
OP realises that now ex wife and love of his life must have left to go to the airport as she's still fuming at him. Commence airport dash.
Ex wife is at said airport, in departures and the trial comes on the news (obviously it's massive news) and she sees OP making a speech and realises he's not guilty and she loves him.
Insert airport hijinks.
OP and love of his life ex wife embrace and say corny line (think of corny line)
The film ends showing OP and love of his life, now wife and mother of his child.
OP owns the evil ex husband/ bosses law firm. 

OP is played by Chris Pratt
Ex wife/ love of life is Jennifer Anniston
Evil ex husband is Gary Busey

"Is that legal? 

- They should not cover the peephole

- They are not allowed to enter if you say you don't allow it, especially if there is no reason to do so (and since the 'beaten senseless' person was at the door..)"
I'd hold off on any anal for a while though.
"The first time me and my ex tried anal the same thing happened to me. Luckily she didn't see it so I just whipped my pants up (they were just sweatpants) and said I had a bad stomach ache then went and cleaned it off. I intentionally never told her because I didn't want her to be embarrassed. Sorry you were so embarrassed haha, but trust me he really doesn't care that much. When you go into poops home you have to be prepared to potentially confront it. "
"Fix the FU with another FU. Send a group of male strippers to his wife at their McMansion. Time it so he walks in on her enjoying the show. Boom. 

Edit: House to McMansion"
"Man, you are so close to ""double secret probation."""

I am a kindergarten teacher and we have the same tradition. Last year one student out of the whole class had a defective bell. Everyone was so excited and she was just standing there crying... Luckily I had extras and was able to swap it out. 
I don't understand that part and why you said that. Care to elaborate?

"Point 2 is completely true. I don't get why people think it's so crazy someone would research about another culture before coming.

I caught my husband giving a tip to a pizza joint for carryout. He's from a country where they don't really tip as much, so he just decided to tip almost everywhere to be safe."

"you just left this poor nondescript ""fake grandma"" at your house all alone? bahahaha. This is amazing. Did your fake grandma and real grandma mock you in Japanese at the dinner table?

"But he returned her, so it doesn't count!"
"I completely agree with you in principle, *but,* I think I'd be furious if I had a kid and they performed a sex act while they were in the car with me. Like, I'm all for letting teenagers safely explore their sexuality, but boundaries are important too. If they want to have sex, they need to wait until they have privacy, instead of subjecting everyone else in the car to their shenanigans. 

For instance, it doesn't sound like ""Amanda's"" parents ever consented to being props to make OP's blowjob more risky and exciting. "
"Best story I've read in a while! Good on ya man, glad to hear it worked out afterwards despite the dad's silence LOL! Cheers"
Sounds like your cat was tired of your shit
"Considering OP said elsewhere in the thread that he borrowed a cell phone to hitch a ride home, his daughter is likely under the age of 16, possibly a lot younger, so he'd probably be angry for a variety of reasons."
As an ex stoner and user of Nair on my   ass...wtf? How could you not feel a thick white cream all over your nethers after sitting down?

Divorced someone's daughter. Nothing is worth it. 
"As someone who has done something similar, albeit before social media, I can propose a possible solution. Offer to apologise to the spouse, and if possible demonstrate the actual issue in front of them.  
  
Man up and own the mistake, or it could be your last at that company.  
  
Story time. I answered my bosses phone one day and it was his wife. I told her truthfully that he was not at work that day and not due to work. That is what his calendar said.  
Unfortunately he had been called to a meeting at head office on short notice and had not updated his calendar. So when he got home his bags were packed and sitting in the driveway.  
I apologised to the wife and showed her the emails, etc. organising the meeting. I explained that I should not have assumed he wasn't working and gave her my details so if she needed to check if he was available she could call me direct and I would chase him down.  
  
Of course, this meant that I was also responsible for his divorce when I deliberately forwarded a call from her to his girlfriends phone because he was a dick."
"It's in the food industry, of course he hates his job."
