"A long time ago, a friend and I were at a mall store, just browsing. A random girl came up beside him and distractedly put her arm through his, leaning close, her head resting ever so intimately on his shoulder. 

I locked eyes with him, and he smirked, standing perfectly still. This lasted for about 20 seconds. She was stroking his arm. 

Slowly, her eyes turned to his. He turned and looked at her.  THAT look lasted for about a split second before she jumped away with a suppressed yelp. 

Her man came from the other aisle, laughing his ass off. Apparently, he had seen her make the mistake, but decided to wait till she realized what she was doing. "
I love how everyone silently agreed to wait.
"I was shopping in a store when I saw my dad looking at a book of some unclothed paper dolls. I very loudly said to my dad, ""what are you looking at you perv"" and the man looked up and wasn't my dad.

Yea so Sheryl is a bitch. 
"Buddy of mine did this to my cousin. Friend's wife and my cousin are both of similar build with the same shade and length of long, lovely red hair.
His wife is generally the only red head around and he walked up be hind my cousin and did a hug/boob squeeze combo. THAT was awkward. He looked up and almost immediately made eye contact with his wife who just walked into the room and you could see the gears in my buddy's head just grind to a halt in confusion. His wife got pissy about it too. Took all of us getting on her ass about how it was *so fucking obviously* an accident and to just let it go. Friend was mortified."

"When my wife was a young girl, her increasingly senile Aunt mistook her for the dog because she was sitting on the floor next to the Aunt's chair. She patted her head &amp; said ""good dog Mcguigan"". 

My wife didn't have the heart to correct her so she kind of made an appreciative dog sound &amp; crawled out of the room. "

"I would talk to your stepdaughter. As I am also a stepdaughter, although I would understand it was an accident, I would be weirded out. If your wife sees/ hears you talked about it/ apologize without any pressure from her she will likely chill out and forgive you.  Years from now your going to joke about it,  but treating it with seriousness will earn you brownie points. Also I wouldn't mention anything about whether or not what she is wearing is appropriate or if she's pretty for a while.  Mothers and teenage daughters can tend to get teritorial."

"I did nearly the same thing but it was the organization expert my wife had hired to help organize our closests. 

I came downstairs where my wife and the organizer were working. As I walked by while looking at my iPhone, I saw my wife in her gray yoga pants bent over at the waist with her ass sticking out of the pantry. Like I usually do when presented with the opportunity, I gently cupped her ass cheek as a walked by, letting my hand graze across her ass and cupping the other cheek as I kept walking right up to the refrigerator to get some juice.  My wife was going through a cabinet next to the fridge. ""Love you"" I said to her as I reached inside the fridge. Then it hit me - if my wife is standing next to the fridge, whose ass did I just fondle sticking out of the pantry?

""Ohmygod"" I yelled and slammed the fridge shut. ""I am so sorry!"" I said to the organizer. ""I thought you were my wife! You're both wearing the same thing!"" I stuttered. The organizer smiled and said ""That's okay, I just figured you were really affectionate people.""

My wife could not stop laughing once she realized what I'd done.  "

They came to the door, I told them they could not come in, they came in anyway, determined I was a risk to myself, took me to the hospital and put me in a paper gown, and I stayed there for 48 hours having blood drawn, people gawk at me, etc. 

In the end, I received a $3600 hospital bill. Happy ending, I refused to pay it, it got sent to collections, then another collections, I went to the credit agencies and claimed it wasn't my debt and it had been passed around so much that it couldn't be verified and it was removed from my credit report.

"Wow! Finally another person that can relate to what I went through!!

When I was in my early 20s, I got into a screaming match with my then boyfriend. It got heated and I slammed the door, causing a picture to fall off the wall and the glass in the frame to break. 

My boyfriend went outside to smoke a cigarette and cool down. I was trying to pick up the shards of glass.

The neighbors called the police because of the yelling, and they arrived as I was crying and cleaning up the glass. They questioned my boyfriend first since he was outside. They came in and started pressing me to say he hit me, even though he hadn't. I was mostly speechless and just kept saying, ""We had a fight.. Everything is fine."" 

The police told me to come with them, that they had some concerns they needed to talk to me more about in the squad car. They put me in the back and started driving. They said they needed to take me to the hospital to make sure I was physically okay. I figured that they didn't believe me that my boyfriend hadn't hit me, but that I would go and get checked out and prove I was fine.

I get to the ER and the cops take me to a room. I sit there for a long, LONG time until an orderly brings me some slippers and PJ type clothing, and a hospital wrist band. I keep asking what is going on and nobody will tell me anything. It seems like hours later, I still haven't seen anyone and a nurse finally shows up and asks me to follow her to another room. It is a bunk room in a different wing of the hospital. She explains I've been admitted for mental health evaluation and that the state has 72 hours to recommend treatment or release me. It's now late at night, and I'm trapped. I fall asleep out of exhaustion. 

The next day, I hang around waiting for a doctor to see me so that I can get out of this place - it all has to be a misunderstanding, right? The nurse calls my name and takes me to an office. It's the financial office. The lady isn't a doctor at all - she's asking me questions about my health insurance and capacity to pay. I was an uninsured college student with no money.. She explains that because of that, they would be transferring me to a state run facility that was an hour away. 

They put my things in a bag and a few hours later, put me in a shuttle to this other facility. Let's just say the hospital mental ward was like a resort compared to this place. 
I *still* haven't seen a doctor. I'm surrounded by drug addicts and crazies. People who are screaming for drugs and trying to cut themselves with the small golf pencils we had. Trying to sleep was impossible because everyone was banging and screaming all night.

Nearly 90 hours after my first interaction with police, I finally saw a doctor who recommended me for release. It was another 4 hours after that before they out processed me for release.

Some interesting points:

- I got a bill for nearly $2,500 for the night I spent in the hospital mental ward and time in the ER. I contested it and they still sent it to collections.

- I did not say ANYTHING about wanting to hurt myself, etc. 

- They kept me well beyond the 72 hour maximum, and I was helpless.

- I ended up getting a very high level security clearance and joining the military. I disclosed the situation, and have never been asked about it again. It's not going to haunt you for life.

I know a lot of people won't believe OP, but I can totally see how his story is plausible."

You didn't know the man or his relationship with the perpetrator of a violent act. What you know is he came to the assistance of the assaulter and attacked you in a life threatening manner as you attempted to restrain the violent criminal until police arrived. Because of his actions this violent criminal got away. Because of your actions that man would not also get away and would be forced to answer police questions.

Do not assume he was trying to help or was an ordinary by-stander. That could very easily have been his friend assisting him in escaping.

You made sure the police could ask everyone involved for statements and piece together an accurate version of events.

Your actions were not excessive but they were passionate. That's it."

"I heard once a story in Finnish radio where the wife called to tell a similar accident. As a backstory there are a lot of community sauna's in Finland that are shared with appartment owners.

They were going to the sauna and the husband went to the dressing room first. The wife picked up some sauna-beers and entered later.

 She went to the dressing room and heard her husband in the shower. So she decided to surprise him. She went in and saw him showering away with his legs spread just so you could see his nutsack hanging. She slowly and quietly walked behind him and pulled his nutsack gently. The guy almost had a heart attack as it wasn't her husband but a neighbour. She entered the wrong sauna."

"We (my family and I) were on vacation in WA when I suddenly had my appendix nearly rupture. We were due to leave that same day, and our friends were leaving town so we couldn't stay at their place any longer. So we end up staying with some old HS friends of my wifes. Apparently while my wife was at the sink doing some dishes, her friends husband walked in, walked up behind her, put his arms around her and kissed her neck, only then realizing it wasn't his wife. She thought it was pretty hilarious, as did her friend, but he was super embarrassed. When I came to after my meds started to wear off, he came over to introduce himself to me and I (having already been told by my wife about what happened) just said ""Hi, I'm lukelnk. I guess you're the guy that kissed my wife"" He just stared at me until I started laughing.

"Yeah I had literally the same thing happen to me a couple years back.

You will not see that money ever again. I called every two weeks and they would tell me that its still under investigation until one day the could no longer find my case. Granted, I live in a city with a really high crime rate so I highly doubt this was even a priority. I was selling a phone and I gave them all the information (mac address, imei number, etc) and they really didn't care. So honestly, no its probably not that bad a fuck up."

"A pretty similar thing happened to me. So, I am a lesbian. I worked at Starbucks at the time, and I was bringing this woman her coffee. Looked exactly like a female and I didn't know she was trans. So I gave her her coffee, said ""Have a nice day,"" and walked back behind the counter. Then my co-worker (also named Sheryl, lol) asked me ""Aren't you a lesbian? Because I saw you flirting with that man over there.""

So I corrected her, told her I was lesbian, and that I wasn't flirting with that customer. Guess what happened the next day?

I got fired for ""unprofessionally talking to customers.""

"I had similar experience, about 20 years ago. Let me just say that I am sorry that this happened to you. In my case I made a sarcastic suicidal remark in the presence of an acquaintance who was a psychology major. He contacted the police and convinced them I was a suicide risk. 

I was lied to so many times by the police and the mental healthcare workers in the next few hours. I was coerced into signing papers that was not allowed time to read. I agreed to what I thought was going to be an just appointment with a psychologist. It turned into a 6 day stay at mental health institution.

I didn't have mental health issues before this indecent. Now 20 years later I still have major ""trust issues"". I missed class and was forced to drop out of school. I was in my senior year in computer engineering at a major university. 20 years later I still don't have a college degree.

I am a very bitter person now. The way the mental health industry reacts to suicide threats ruins more lives than it saves. I hope you have better luck."

"I've been in situations where a black dude or a group of black folks  were  getting restrained by security and staff of a theater, and other black folks started crowding around, started supporting them verbally, then physically. 

In both cases, the perpetrators got away. 

Same theater, a guy asked a woman to get off of her cell phone, which led to a verbal altercation within the theater, then they waited for the guy after the movie, and stabbed him with a meat thermometer. 

It was actually more serious than it sounds, the victim is now wheelchair bound, has vision problems,  and the guy who attacked  him got 40 years. http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/12/lancaster-man-convicted-for-violent-meat-thermometer-attack-moviegoer.html

I got confronted by a kid that was bigger than me, so I put the kid in a headlock. A couple that had no idea what the scuffle was about started defending the kid. I'm guessing the kid was around 15.

Employees of a store I owned wouldn't help an adult getting attacked by 4 teens, and the adult, although bigger and in OK shape, got the shit beat out of him. 

Tales of retail, I have lots of them. I owned my own retail business for over 20 years. 5 armed robberies, about 50 burglaries, many cases of vandalism, weekly attempts by people to get free food through scams, various sorts of theft by employees, etc. I'm glad to be out of the business.
