"Reminds me of the time I was in college, and some friends and I decided to play BB gun wars.  Like airsoft, except we actually used metal BBs (don't worry, we wore eye protection).

Everything was going fine, most of us were terrible shots.  We also had a pump limit rule on the rifles, so it wasn't as bad, and they weren't too overpowered compared to the people who only had pistols.

Well, then one of the guys with rifles shot me right in the forehead, right at the hair line.  It hurt!  I was sure he had over pumped, so I ran at him screaming, and unloading my pistol.  He yelped and ran off.

Shortly thereafter, one of the other guys got shot in the lower lip, and the BB got lodged in it.  They decided to go to the emergency room to take it out, and he had to get two stitches.

The story doesn't end here, though.  The BB wound in my head left a welt that still hadn't gone down after several days, which I thought was unusual.  I was messing around with an old harddrive and absent-mindedly poking the wound.  Suddenly I heard a small scraping sound, and I knew that the BB had been lodged in my head.

I panicked slightly;  some friends and I were going to set up a Tekken 2 tournament soon, and I didn't want to miss it at the doctor's office.  I poked at the lump on my head again, and heard a little scrape again.

Then I got an idea.  I knew BBs used two different types of metals, copper or steel.  I picked up one of the magnets that had been in the harddrive and put it to my head.  I could feel a slight tugging and knew it was steel.  Well, that was pretty neat.  I still didn't want to go to the doctor, though.

I continued to play with the magnet and the BB, still pondering what I should do.  I was about to get up to go to the doctor's when I heard a little ""plink!"".  I looked at the magnet, and there was a small bloody BB sitting on it.  I cleaned the blood off of my forehead.

The Tekken 2 tournament started shortly, and I ended up with second place."

"Ok, stupid fuck up on your part. 

But I will never understand asshole customers that make a huge fucking deal over literally nothing. I seriously feel that these people live such miserable lives that they thrive off of opportunities to be douchebags because it's the only time they get to feel some kind of power or importance. It's sad. "

"One time, working a Mother's Day brunch, I was walking table to table asking if anyone wanted a refill of OJ. 

I thought I heard one man say, ""Yes, please,"" so I repeated, ""Yes, please?"" back to him, confirming that that was what he said. Apparently he had only said, ""Yes,"" and his wife got super pissy 'cause she thought I was correcting her husbands manners.

I apologized profusely, and she eventually calmed down, but damn.... it was an honest mistake. And really, some manners couldn't hurt, right?

Edit: So maybe this is a little confusing.... I was NOT trying to correct the dude's manners, it was a looooong shift and I wasn't really thinking clearly and it *was* a pretty dumb thing to say."

"There's a Whataburger by me that actually makes much better burgers than others in the chain. The employees are happy. The place is clean. I love going there. 

One day as I was eating, a customer came in to make a scene about one of their children's burgers missing cheese when they ordered cheese. It was a small mistake on a $60 order, but the employee was apologies all around, new cheeseburger coming post-haste. Well, it wasn't enough for the customer on their new-found power trip. The customer started berating the employee.

 The moment that happened, something followed that I've never seen: The manager stormed out and dressed the customer down. ""How dare you speak to my employees like that? Take your cheeseburger and please apologize to my staff or never return here again."" The customer immediately returned their chiding tone and the manager interrupted ""Take your food and get the hell out of my restaurant."" and just stared at the customer until they left. 

I go out of my way to visit that Whataburger. "

"Have worked in the hospitality industry my whole life. The asshole customers make a big deal over literally nothing because they want free shit.

I know its fucked up but its just how it goes. The bigger the deal, the more free shit you get.

Edit: I just wanted to add this in. Being a good/respectful/enjoyable customer pays off MUCH better in the long run.

Shitty customer makes a big deal (lets imagine he was actually freaking out over something stupid) and gets his $80 meal comped. Hell think he won and be happy with his free shit. 

Good customer is always friendly and nice to serve when at the establishment. Anytime I see friendly customer I will be much more inclined to give them the better table, cut down on their wait time if possible, learn their names so they feel like a big shot (silly but means a lot to some people), maybe throw free desserts or drinks. 

It almost ALWAYS pays off to be a good customer :)"

"My friends and I once decided to prank a house party in the middle of the night in a very rural area. There were 5 of us in the back of a truck going to throw tube-launched fireworks by hand into the front yard and drive away. (Nobody was in the big empty front yard so it was a safe plan)...

Now... what happened. We drove past the house once or twice to figure out a getaway plan. We prepared designated throwers and my friend was driving. 

The friend that was driving insisted on lobbing a couple twisted together ""artillery shell"" fireworks as well. To do this, he was going to throw OUT the driver side window with his non-dominant arm, over the truck and into the yard. While some of us in the back lit our bouquets of fireworks as well. 

The fuck-up..... friend stops, lights, and tosses his... it lands in the bed of the truck with 5 of us friends... only one other guy got his 3roundÃ—3 bouquet lit.... which he immediately dropped in the bed as when he saw the rest. 

What I remember.  We stop, we light... I'm trying to light mine. I hear ""Oh fuck"". I turn and see the second friend drop his and know we are all fucked. I pull my hood up and my faux leather jacket tight and cover against the tailgate as FIFTEEN FUCKING EXPLOSIONS rock a truck bed filled with 5 people.

Dead silence. Quick check. Everyone is alive. I start yelling ""Just fucking drive!"" At 1st friend who was driving...

Minor burns to the 2nd friend  but after dropping his bouquet he had it coming.... otherwise I have a pair of jeans with distinctive scorch marks near my balls.

Before you ask... yes. There was alcohol involved."

"You forgot the first two rules of gun safety:

1. The weapon is always loaded
* The weapon is *ALWAYS* loaded

The rest of the basic rules for those who may not be familiar with firearms:

* The safety is never on
* Never point the weapon at something you do not intend to kill
* Never have your finger inside the trigger guard / on the trigger unless you intent to shoot
* Always be aware of what is beyond your target

Note these are *basic* rules. Yes there are more, no I am not going into an exhaustive list on firearm safety. 

If you want to learn more, I suggest you contact your local gun range, many of them including the one I belong to, offer 100% free and open to the public gun safety classes. There are also classes available via the [NRA](http://www.nrainstructors.org/Search.aspx). You may be against them politically, and that is fine. I still recommend you at least learn the basics of firearms safety.

If abstinence only education doesn't prevent teen pregnancy, why would abstinence only education work on firearm safety?"

"At a previous retail job I had just finished up with a customer that swore I didn't give her a receipt. I politely assured her I did, suggested she check her pockets and/or bag, but she was adamant I did not. I remained smiling and civil, and she eventually found it in her own purse where she had clearly put it. 

When she stormed off, I muttered ""yeah don't say sorry or anything"" to myself, not realizing her ~10 year old daughter was in earshot. The daughter told the mom what I said, and I was mortified, knew I fucked up and should have just kept my mouth shut.  

As she is walking back over to me I'm thinking, ""fuckfuckfuckfuck"" but she actually apologized for not apologizing!!! She said she didn't raise her daughter that way and she should set a good example - I also apologized, as I shouldn't have been muttering. Close call."

"I think a version of this needs to be present in all food and retail chains.

Someone whose job is to find out the problem, see if the appropriate response is taken, and if the employee isn't doing enough or the customer is demanding/overstepping then put them in their place. If 75% of stores would do this, then customers would have to act like human beings and couldn't say that bullshit line ""I'm never coming back here, there's stores all over town and I go to instead!""

If that were true they wouldn't be shopping there in the first place.

I wouldn't take shit from customers of such a small thing as well. It's like someone asking for a certain sauce, food comes out, souce is missing. They could go ask for it, get the sauce and just be chill, but sometimes something happens...between their ass lifting off the seat and the walking towards the counter they become more of an animal than human. They demand their sauce IMMEDIATELY! They get the sauce they desperately want, but it has no meaning anymore. Now they want everyone to know they are better than the other customers and employees. They are the alpha...they hit their chest as if they expect employees to offer tribute or the keys to the store...they know they probably won't get anything, so after a scene they storm back to their seat and sit wondering if all that trouble was worth the sauce...knowing it wasn't, which makes them angrier. Their burger is marred by their emotions, but they eat it anyway."

We had some really clever ways to show our balls to each other. But one guy was a bit older, Ryan, maybe in his 40s who was a server there, to make ends meet for his family, wasn't into it and seemed very annoyed by the dick showing game. 

But one day myself, another server and the older Ryan. We're standing by a macros all waiting to type our orders in when Ryan walked over to his table and started to take the order of a family of four sitting in a booth. We glance over and Ryan still acknowledging the family's order turns his hips to us, lifts up his servers apron and presents to us the fact he's been walking around the restaurant with his dick out for god knows how long, waiting for the moment to present his one and only time playing the game. That being said it was so ballsy that we couldn't possibly top that and the game slowly fizzled out at the restaurant."

"Growing up in the rural Midwest we did stuff like this all time. Bottle rockets, Roman candles, BB guns.....well until the summer I was 14. We were shooting at each other with BB guns, having a blast. We too used a pump rule and never had issues up until this point.

Anyways here we are having fun and my friend goes to shoot at me. Misses by a mile but we hear his 9 year old little sister let out a yelp. She's laying on the ground screaming. We freak out, ambulance comes. She heads to hospital, emergency surgery, after that ICU. Cops come and question us, his parents are livid. What ended up happening was a freak accident where he missed me but hit her. It hit her collarbone and ricocheted in her body. Was a 1/2 an inch from her heart. My friend swore he only pumped twice but I dont know.

This was 14 years ago, she's fine now. But I wasn't allowed at their house for a long time and we never had BB wars again."

I worked at a vet for a decade and this dog came in and  had ate  *a whole bag of weed* (sorry I'm unsure of the amount, had to be a ziplock bag full) and he was high as a kite and it was the funniest fucking thing ever.

I had the same thought myself. I did let the doctor know and he looked at it and was satisfied that it is poison ivy. The site was scrubbed thoroughly multiple times before the actual surgery so the likelihood that any actual poison got in is slim. Buuuuuuut... there may still be blisters on or near the incision.
