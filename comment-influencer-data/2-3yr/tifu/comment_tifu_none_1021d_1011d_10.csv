I imagine that Lady's husband was at home getting a kick out of knowing whatever guy she fucked was about to get shit on. 
"You gotta tie a string around your boyfriend, attach the other end to a door knob and slam the door.

edit: Thanks for my first gold, stranger."
Text your friend and tell him to explain it to your wife. She might not believe your story.
"After two months dating I would normally assume she has a boyfriend... you.

From your story I really dislike this person and she sounds quite dumb too. I don't know what else to say.  Hope you're okay."
"That ass hair is needed, I'll tell you what. If a guy shaves it, say goodbye to that buffer zone that prevents chaffing, and be prepared to have astro glide ass at the drop of a dime. 

You think swamp ass is bad? Swamp ass is a necessary evil. Bare cheek sweaty astro glide ass is horrendous."
I shave my asshole regularly and have never had this problem! Now I'm worried I'm just playing with fire
"That seems extreme.  Like she's been looking for excuse.  I could be way off base, but if you meet being honest and apology was sincere most sensible women would know well enough and move on.  "
"So you ""fucked the shit out of her"" if I understand this correctly.
Edit: thanks for the gold stranger"
"Doesn't sound so much like TIFU as ""today I lived my dreams and sent a bunch of wasps straight to hell"""
"Oh yes, true love.
I was peeing and my SO came in saying he had to go NOW. I thought this was hilarious so of course just sat there. He challenged and said he was going to pee between my legs into the toilet. 
I'm hysterically laughing at this point and he actually starts doing it, which makes me laugh even harder. I can't control my laughing at this point and I'm squirming because I literally cannot breathe. My squirming causes me to put myself directly in his aim and he subsequently pees on my vagina.
As soon as I felt the warmth, my laughter turned into tears and I started gagging, throwing up on his feet.
"
You use your mouth prettier than a 20 dollar whore.
"So now that the passion is all dried up all that remains is a crusty reminder. 

edit: Cherry popped!  Thanks for the gold kind stranger."
Squeezing and bending to stop the flow sounds god awful!
Ahh nothing sexier than choking on a pickle and dying !
This is the most European TIFU I've ever read
It also gives one an idea why their married sex life is lacking. 
"As soon as you get unstuck, pee! And then drink as much water as you can and pee more to flush your urethra - you're in prime UTI country right now. "
"*sees NSFW tag*

*clicks at the speed of sound*

**Insert cliché ""thanks for gold"" comment here**"
Some people would pay good money for that shit. 
Damn. That's a super shitty outcome. I hope everything works out.
"Should have followed it up with ""See, this is what I have to deal with every time I need to go to the bathroom."""
Can I see
"1. Disconnect pipe from disposal. 
2. Run a drain auger (~$15) down the pipes.
3. Don't do that shit again.

Edit: WTF, my highest voted comment is about fixing plumbing issues while my home is currently undergoing repairs from two separate plumbing issues..."
"Yeah we were talking about getting a place together and everything but I guess I was just a guy who didn't need a pill for some fun to her. Surprisingly she was actually pretty smart, i mean smart enough to hide it all that long. I'll be fine, my nose is the only thing that hurts lol. thank you for the concern."
Especially saying it seems they've grown apart and people change from 20 to 30. Sounds like she's already thought about this and came up with justifications. 
"My ex wife used to talk dirty like that...

Then we got divorced and now she bangs chicks."
"Check license plate # and ask are you here for _______? 

I've learned my lesson

Edit: 
A lot of posters saying ""ask for the name of the driver, don't just say your name"" - I agree with this completely, where I live I often get names of people I don't know how to pronounce and I have a relatively irrational fear of offending somebody by saying their name wrong haha. This is just me, it works well enough to not have had a problem ever"
The image of taking that sexy police officer to a real police station is hilarious. 
"whilst I appreciate the joke with context, as an opening message to a conversation that's creepy as fuck. Doesn't matter if she understood the joke if she doesn't know you very well then mentioning killing people she loves is going to be an instant red flag for her.

Live and learn I guess."
"Dating 2 months, talking about getting a place together.... wot? "
Today I lit the fuck up
"Jesus Christ, a lot of shit went down due to one easy mistake.

The Good Samaritan that gave you the charger sounded kinda rapey when you first introduced him
""He said maybe and invited me in"" idk, maybe just me.

Edit:
WTF autocorrect 
(Rapey=Daley apparently)"
This is the most American thing I can imagine someone who's not an American doing. 
Don't be ridiculous.  Everybody knows if you're in a bad situation you have to use the last of your phone battery to write a TIF.  Gotta get that karma.
"&gt;'I keep excreting'

Yeah dude, you were part of some weird scat fantasy, you just didn't know it."
"With being young and needing joint income to have a place, finding someone you can share a bed with is much better than a 2 bedroom with a person that may skip rent... and it was going really well up until last night!"
Hey its me ur pickle
How was the steak? 
"i mean, that was my plan all along"
"One bottle of wine, she's tight as fuck. Two, she just goes to shit. --Husband"
"A cute and hirsute little lass

While bathing was shaving her ass.

She fled a bloodsucker,

Then bled from her pucker,

And had to give romance a pass."

Steak was great.

"Why is this so low? Easiest solution right here assuming op didn't leave anything out. Other guy should still have the whole conversation on his phone... which might be embarrassing, but better than her thinking he's cheating!

Edit: I'm not saying the wife doesn't have other motives... it's pretty weird (could also be OP leaving out some details). But if you confirm your story then either it blows over or you can figure out what's actually wrong.

Unless the other guy *also* deleted the texts. Then you're boned."
"Don't stop here, this is UTI country!"
Just looked at your history. This is a bs story
Well it works on a hosepipe...
"Well..probably any solvent was a better plan. ..nail polish remover , kerosene, gasoline..."
"...Can't you call for help? And best case scenario, can't you light the train on fire and then pull the lever?"
"Somewhere out there is a doctor, slamming back a drink and typing out his TIFU entitled ""Today i fucked up by showing up to work"". Aint no-one gets paid enough for that."
I was in need of a one liner. This would have been perfect. 
"C'mon OP, it's just a dick. We see those all the time here on Reddit."
"&gt; and it was going really well up until last night!

No it wasn't, you just thought it was.

She was lying/hiding from both of you and cheating on the other guy. If it didn't end now it would've ended way worse later on"
There was no two for one deal on that wine. The husband bought the second one.
"I joke with my wife about doing this, she  thinks it's gross and would never do it. I don't care either way, it's not like I really want to do it. What I really want to do is have her agree to do it, then while she sits there with her knees spread waiting for me to piss in the bowl, I'm going to tell her to pee at the same time. Then I'm going to piss blast her right in the face, and just keep spraying her as long as I can.

I'm almost certain I would get divorced after doing that, but it's still my plan if she ever agrees to it."
Ross Geller is that you?
" End thread now, we have a winner. "
"Rule of thumb here: If girlfriend/wife ever suggest a threesome with another girl...let them initiate it and that's it.

My wife talks about it sometimes but I know it won't happen and I won't pursue it unless she comes up to me and says she found the perfect girl or something like that."
"&gt;‘I keep excreting.’

I was doing okay until this line, and completely lost it. 10/10."
"I was just thinking that. But with a little bit of addon. The most Western European TIFU i've ever read. You can't do this in Eastern Europe, our trains give out a very rapey vibe and are so uncomfortable nobody can get anything done while in there. "
"&gt; After a couple minutes someone in the room challenged me with a ""won't do that with your dick though!"" So I obliged.

This was the part where I realised OP was a different sorta guy to me."
Next time ask me first.

Edit: thanks for breaking my gold cherry"
I'm going to play devil's advocate here because everyone seems to think your wife  is using this an an excuse...She found sexy pictures in your phone and you have no way to prove what actually happened. I would assume you were cheating and wouldn't believe you unless you had proof you weren't.  Like maybe go on your phone company website and prove that the pics came from your bud's phone or maybe have your bud talk to your wife idk! I'm a lady who likes hard proof because I've been cheated on before.

Years later the child will grow up to impregnate or be impregnated by another cow, and the cycle begins anew. No but seriously can't a guy know how well you cooked your meat? Fuckin hell...

"Easy Fix, cut the bird into sections.  2 breast sections , 2 drum stick sections, take out stuffing and put stuffing in muffin pan... turkey cooks in a 1/4 of the the time and stuffing has crispy bits for everyone ... not a big nasty pile of gooey bread.

"Had something like this happen when I was in high school... My gf at the time had me over and we skipped school. Her dad came home early.

Now, this motherfucker was like a 6'5 jacked hitler looking guy. He knew something was up when she was home early, and started searching the house. I was in her closet, instead of making it out the back door like I wanted to in the first place... Should not have listened to her.

So, her dad finds me in the closet under a cover of clothes... Grabs me, pulls me out, and basically carries me outside and throws me out the door lol. There was a bit of yelling and a few fuck you's thrown back and forth. Had to put my clothes back on in full view of a busy street, was interesting. Some people I knew definitely saw me.

My ex didn't understand why we couldn't date after that when I broke up with her."

Two bits of advice.

1. Find out the guy's email and send him an anonymous untraceable email saying you're sorry and she lied to you, so you didn't know she was with someone. Explain how long you'd been together and give him the info he needs to make a decision about her.

If this had happened to me, the biggest issues would be a) him not talking about this with me at all outside of the bedroom, and b) his assumption that his friend's wife would be a perfect candidate for this sort of thing - no vetting required. In fact, as far as we know, neither female party was consulted about this. I'd feel kind of whored out if my husband pulled this.

Also a box of whips, a box of chains, a case of firecrackers, a pint of raw baby formula, and about two dozen whipits. Not that we needed all that for the sex. But once you get locked into a serious kink collection, the tendency is to take it as far as you can.

The only thing that worried me was the baby formula. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of a formula binge, and I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff soon enough.

EDIT: Thanks for my first gold and the nice compliments and stuff. I'm perpetually updating my mom on the feedback to my comment. She wants to thank you too. 

EDIT 2: Mom wants you to know that since dad left I haven't felt comfortable leaving the house or interacting with other males, and that the people of Reddit have gone a long way towards relieving my anxieties and helping me reintegrate as a social being in society, so she's thankful for that.

EDIT 3: She also wanted me to ask if you guys were interested in coming to my birthday party next month?? You don't have to bring a present or anything and I know a lot of you are probably busy but it would mean a lot to her. You know how moms are lol. Happy holidays!

EDIT 4: Mom says that if you're gonna come you should bring your own plate and silverware, plus some kind of side like coleslaw or seafood salad or whatever. It's gonna be a potluck kind of thing I guess. But really you don't have to we're making plenty of food and my sister is bringing Buffalo Wild Wings for everyone. 

EDIT 5: I'm SO SORRY everyone but it looks like the party is off. My sister was in a wild wings related accident and she had to go to the hospital. It looks like she'll be okay but she needs surgery. After they reattach her butt they said she'll have to spend two to six months learning how to poop again, and sadly she probably will never be able to do anal again. Sorry for getting all your hopes up about the party. Maybe next year??"

I'm not saying your wife actually wants a divorce but I think she's unhappy about something maybe some counselling or a conversation about what she's actually unhappy about is probably a good step.

Why would she actively ruin her son's future?

What a fucking bitch..."
"TIFU's in realtime! Aaah, we're living in the future. "
Hey...is it safe to spray my asshole with Paco Rabane?
"lol i had my car in the shop and was using a rental for a few days, i parked at a gas station, went in and did my thing, came back and got in my car. i look on the passenger seat and im like ""who put a briefcase in my car""...then i look out the windshield and see a guy standing there with a weird look on his face...then look to the left and see my rental car. 

a guy with an identical car parked next to me and i got in it

he was a good sport about it and laughed it off"

"well then, every straight male in the entire world, guess I'm your gal. just kidding pls don't inbox me lol"
"I know that i""m not in the wrong here, i feel bad for the other guy but it was totally worth it. Sex for 2 months and my first TIFU worthy experience lol"
"Also, now you get to enjoy the prickly, itching sensation for a few days as it grows back"
"Everyone should have renters insurance. In 2012 while I was at my Grandfathers funeral, a house I was renting burned to the ground caused by a roommates cigarette not properly disposed of... total loss. I did not have renters insurance. 3 days later my employer laid me off.

Probably the worst week of my life. Things are alot better now. 

And I have renters insurance, now.



Edit: a word. "
"My brother did this to me when we were little. He ended up peeing all over me and I was screaming.  My mother walks in to see what the commotion was about, and I'm pretty sure her soul left her at that moment.  I didn't throw up though. That's a nice touch."
i was disappointed in myself as well. i can usually do like 8 inches!! :/ 
"No, as a Uber and Lyft driver, if you ask who I'm there for, I WILL NOT TELL YOU.   
You can ask my name to confirm, you can say your name, but I will not say your name until you do. There are way too many people who try to hijack other people's rides. Sometimes there are honest mix-ups like a ton of people leaving one place.   
We don't get paid for those and the rider gets screwed to. It is clearly in our training material as well.  DO NOT SAY THEIR NAME. ASK THEIR NAME.  
We must have you verify who you are.   
You always have a pic of our car, license plate, and pic of us. You can verify us easy. We don't have that of you (sometimes a pic on Lyft) all we have to verify you with is you giving us your name.  

Also check the make/color and license plate. It's pretty foolproof."
"90% of the 'sexy' handcuffs with pink frills, leather etc are designed to be escapable/separable by the person cuffed, given a few minutes. This is for obvious reasons.

It was a practice funeral. 
"Especially after dumbass lied about it first. I might have believed the story first, but the lie, followed by the story? Yeah. no.
"
What happened to washing your ass like a normal person?
"So in summary:

1) don't road rage because you're clearly not very good at it, and it can kill someone for Pete's sake, and over something inconsequential

2) learn how to read road signs especially in NY where roads go above each other and buildings block gps, and slow down if you don't know where you are

3) remember to pay attention to the road when you're on the phone... again, you could kill someone

4) keep a phone charger in your car especially if you're using gps for a long drive. LI to NJ in areas with spotty reception, that'll eat up your battery

5) learn your pin.

Glad it worked out for you, happy thanksgiving! And seriously, stop road raging. Karma's a bitch. Missing your exit wasn't the f up, getting so mad you drove stupidly causing you to miss your exit is the true f up."

Yes.

"Well, the dude hid that the incident when the pictures happened, then lied at first when she found them.... and *then* came clean. Can't really blame her for not believing him. He really fucked up handling the situation."
"Oyy, those potato peels. 

Thank goodness for apartment maintenance."
"If you are texting it's harder to get a message accross, because there is no emotion attachted to it. I found that i had a lot of unneeded conflicts with my girlfriend due to misunderstandings. 

I'm sure this joke could be pulled off flawlessly in person, but i agree it's kind of creepy."
Yeah somebody tell him it's called a creek and then get this guy a beer. 
so high five him?
"If you can reach, spit will re-wet the area. Otherwise, if he gets you off again, you'll be wet again, which will loosen everything up. Been there, done that.

Guess one point in favor of the shavers. Can't happen to them. "
"Hey that's pretty clever

Unrelated: does anyone want a fun purple shovel and a wacky green revolver for free?"
I stand by it. It's a disgrace what they did
Is this *REALLY* a fuck up? Any day in which something blows up or burns is a win in my book lol
"I can only assume it is a sugar daddy situation... She has a nice car, gets to live in a nice house and apparently get's young fun on the side. She seemed super happy with me and wanted to advance the relationship so idk if she wanted out or she was leading me on. Either way she lost out."
It's a cum joke. Nobody gets the cum joke!
That's a good rule. I mentioned it to my boyfriend and started looking into it but then changed my mind. I told him how I felt and we both agreed that if the situation presented itself it would be on the table.
"""Jesus Christ, a lot of shit went down due to one easy mistake.""

&gt;I miss the exit for the Verrazzano because I was trying to get back at someone for doing something stupid in another lane



No this all started because OP was was road raging.

"Did they see your willy wonka?
Or did you quickly turn around and show off the chocolate factory?"
"this comment terrified me since my date always says ""jesus"" but I'm guessing his username probably has the words ""pickle fetish"" in it so I'm hoping you're not him"
Has anyone seen my mother?

Do people ask about it when you hook up?  What do you tell them?
"In just reading this, when OP said ""my wife introduced talking dirty"" after an up and down sex life, I immediately got that she was ""salvaging"" in some way. Trying to find interest in something she's not necessarily 100% satisfied with. And thus, has had some reservations. 

But, she wants a divorce after this type of sexual misunderstanding without trying to work through it? Sounds like she's taking this excuse and running with it. 

Gut is saying something else is up and that she's unhappy with something (beyond this fuck up)."
"Yeah, because that's a totally new thing. Girls have never used sex to make money ever before."
As much as your story wrenches the heart strings.... I'm so grossed out that she had sex with you and then had sex with him when he got home. And during that time you were in the closet..... wtf. 
"I can find a decent set of stairs with only like 5 bucks worth of gas at MOST.

Oh no that was a terrible joke..."
Yes
Woman can be assholes too.
Asking the impotent questions....
"The lol at the end made me laugh, nice touch."
"That's what I thought too. They said regardless of the word, it ""was clear I was being a disruption to the class"" etc etc. It's such a load of bollocks. Surely even if they don't believe me they might see the funny side.

Edit: Actually, you've given me an idea. I could always get a friend to show them this post... that might help sway them. I have a disciplinary meeting tomorrow, so I'll let you know how it goes.

Edit 2: I know realise considering getting someone to see this post is incredibly stupid. I assure you that won't be happening."
"&gt;Jane is a squirter, meaning upon sexual stimulation up to and including orgasm, Jane lets forth warm gushed bursts of liquid from her vagina....Moments later the floor was covered in female ejaculate. 

You...you realize...that's piss, right?  

This chick both pissed and shit all over you.

You were her toilet."
I feel like you are either a parent or you've been on masterchef 😂
Were they impressed that you drove or by your huge dong?
TIL Switzerland is abbreviated CH. 
Sooooo how about having your friend show the whole text conversation to your wife? Or at least screen shot it to send it over to you. Given two conditions: your friend didn't delete his texts and this is not a fake story.
"Ok I feel bad, I lol'ed"
the best part of this post is orangies
2 to 100 real quick-like.
The brother thing makes it a lot weirder
"Not fucking sneaky in the slightest. She probably has been thinking about this for a while; you don't say things like ""growing apart"" without having thought about it for a while. But how is that ""sneaky""!?! That's human. Dude, you need to shake that head around some. Paranoia is a hell of a drug."
Indeed. But I need to see yours first. ILickAnalBlo-...oh my.....
I don't know why everyone assumes she shits *every* time she has sex. Did I miss something? I was under the impression that the 2 bottles of wine -and perhaps whatever they ate- was what caused her distress.
"Sounds like the title of a Dr. Suess book:

"You missed your exit for revenge in traffic. No sympathy here. 
Following your gps blindly without looking at the road.
Karma is a bitch."
