"Luckily I was just a volunteer, so they couldn't reprimand me! I doubt I'll volunteer for them anytime soon... The guy that discovered my mistake gave me the 'disappointed dad' look.

I'm sure all the runners were told where they were led astray. Admittedly, I avoided the finish line and slipped away as the event ended. "

This is excellent. Did you get reprimanded? Were any of the runners pissed at you?
You're weird as fuck and it makes you fantastic. Carry on.
"In defense of the runners, when you are running your ass off in the lead pack your brain really isn't working at full capacity.  Especially when you are 2km from the finish and you are really hurting at that point.  It can be hard to memorize all the turns of a half marathon if you aren't familiar with the area.  

It's really the fault of the race organizer.  There should've been a lead cyclist showing the leaders where to go and lots of clear marking of the course.  However I was even lead off course by the lead cyclist one race.  Very frustrating."
"This is a truth I've known, now put into words. Thank you, fellow human."
"It's not your fault. If the runners don't know the route, then how the hell is a random volunteer supposed to know? There should be clearly marked signs to let the runners know which way to go."

"This hits close to home for me. When I was in spanish class in 7th grade I had been playing around with a pencil eraser and ended up putting it in my ear. I lost it within my ear canal in seconds and was panicking that I couldn't retrieve it. I got home and tried using tweezers but it only pushed it further in. I went to bed that night only to wake up feeling fine. I felt like I could hear out of it just like before so I concluded it must have fallen out in my sleep. 

Fast forward to right after my 22nd birthday and I'm in line to get this factory job. I already got the job I just needed to pass the hearing test, however I failed miserably in one ear. I went to the doctor to find out why I'm not hearing well out of that ear and they start looking in the ear and say they see something pink. ""it looks like a pencil eraser"". It was in my head for 9 years. When they got it out it almost felt like it had been petrified hard from being there for so long. Probably one of the dumbest moments of my life. I still have the eraser in a little urine sample cup "
"Reminded me of this similar story:

&gt;This happened just last year, but it certainly deserves to be included in the annals of mathematical legends:

&gt;A graduate student (let's call him Saeed) is in the airport standing in a security line. He is coming back from a conference, where he presented some exciting results of his Ph.D. thesis in Algebraic Geometry. One of the people whom he met at his presentation (let's call him Vikram) is also in the line, and they start talking excitedly about the results, and in particular the clever solution to problem X via blowing up eight points on a plane.

&gt;They don't notice other travelers slowly backing away from them.

&gt;Less than a minute later, the TSA officers descend on the two mathematicians, and take them away. They are thoroughly and intimately searched, and separated for interrogation. For an hour, the interrogation gets nowhere: the mathematicians simply don't know what the interrogators are talking about. What bombs? What plot? What terrorism?

&gt;The student finally realizes the problem, pulls out a pre-print of his paper, and proceeds to explain to the interrogators exactly what ""blowing up points on a plane"" means in Algebraic Geometry.

While extending a hand to his wife and in that moment you know you've not only emasculated him but made yourself look like an asshole.  Then you try to pick up the cereal but he waves you away and you're too awkward to leave so you kind of skirt on the sidelines while his wife asks if he's ok, but he doesn't answer so she looks at you pleadingly and you have no answers for her and before any can be formed they just walk away and you have to hang onto the shame of knowing that you probably destroyed a family.

I once gave a dude $10 that said he needed to get a bite to eat and a little bit of gas to get home.  He seemed really embarrassed to even ask, so I thought what the heck - was the only cash I had (living around a lot of bums has made me only carry a debit card).

He comes back looking distraught and asked if I could just drive him home.  Fine.  He said it was ""just a few miles away,"" so dumb me loads him up and starts taking the turns he tells me to.  About 15 minutes into this drive at 3am, I'm like ""dude, where do you live?""

It turns out he *may* have lived 60 miles away - I dropped him off there anyhow at *his aunt's house* where there were no lights on and he walked right past the driveway into the woods.  I figured I'd never see him again and felt like an idiot for driving some random dude 60 miles after also giving him $10.

My buddy is part of the urology service that helps reattach it for this guy. 

Well he REALLY didn't want it because when this guy wakes up post-operatively he grabs his newly reattached penis and rips it off. 

They take him back to the OR (not sure what insurance covers two penis reattachment surgeries in a 24 hour period) and attach it again. 

They ended up consulting orthopedics to place this guy in a full upper body cast with his arms held out in front (think mummy) to keep him from ripping off his dick again.

Mustard gas is a horrifying blister agent that cannot be easily defended against like chlorine. (Soldiers in a pinch in WWI could save themselves from chlorine by pissing on a cotton rag.) It causes any exposed part of the body to develop huge, painful blisters."

"I remember when I was in elementary school, a doctor made a report that I was ""having trouble with my classroom behavior"" and had the report forwarded to, among other people, the teacher. The next day, she called my mom in tears. Turns out the scribe had changed ""classroom"" to ""cancer"" so naturally, she was concerned. "

"In defense of the redditors, when you are redditing your ass off in the TIFU thread your brain really isn't working at full capacity. Especially when you are not far from the end of the comments and you are really laughing at that point. It can be hard to read all of the comments when you moderate a thread like that and sometimes you forget about making sure the person who writes the comments knows the rules.

It's really the fault of the redditor. There should've been a lead moderator showing the other redditors where to read and lots of clear comments on the thread. However I was even read off the website by comments one thread. Very reddited.

And then you finish it off with the same guy ripping his penis off...I don't even have the words to describe how uncomfortable and mentally hurting I am."

"When I was on high school, I made ear plugs out of my little brother's blue play dough. That shit was literally stuck in my ear for a year and it was visible to some people if they looked from the correct angle. I went to the doctor and he said it was too soft to remove so I just had to let it dissolve. He also told me he's had to remove play dough from ears in the past, but never for anyone over the age of 5 -_-"

It's really the fault of the ass organizer.  There should've been a lead ass showing the asses where to go and lots of clear marking of the ass.  However I was even lead off course by the lead ass one race.  Very frustrating. ass.

"There has been a terrorist in Germany who bought all of his ""ingredients"" for his bomb in the small region he lived in where everyone knew everyone.. He was walking with the bomb in his hands through the streets and greeted everyone like you usually do in such small cities."
"Man, please forgive my frankness here, but if you still have your foreskin, make it a point to let the ol turtle head out at least once a day only if you can without problems or exacerbation though.

It's been over a decade but I once spilled a fresh gas station Road-Ready (hotasfuck) Espresso on my dong and really babied it as it healed.  It healed up super tight and I pissed out of a hole in my foreskin the diameter of a pencil for years to come.  Looked like I was passing a chestnut every time.

Just realized you probably have insurance and can get pro help.  

I had a q-tip, an OD green bandana, and more rubbing alcohol than sense back then...the shiddiness of my experience is probably why I was compelled to reach out to you here, but I wasted a lot of time typing this on mobile and don't want it to be for naught and if you and reddit want this hidden, down vote 2 shits and a pound of grits out of it and I'll put it back in the box.

"The thing about ""I'd never do that sober"" is that it only seems like a legitimate excuse to the person making it.

"I recall hearing a story from when i was a kid about a local couple that use to give out free money to people in need but then someone pointed out that the people may be using that money to buy drugs.

 There's nothing more annoying than jerking off and having somebody knock at the door… They know what you're fucking doing in there but they won't leave you alone. They have to be assholes and just bother you for no reason
You've obviously never taken acid around sober people. 
"Terrorism.

The name comes from the word ""terror"". The objective is to make you live in terror of an attack happening. That's exactly what you do. You have a security pantomine for aeroplanes, you arrest and question people who happen to use a naughty word, and you allow thw securiry services to violate your privacy so they might stop more attacks.

Meanwhile, your risk of death from a random shooting is thousands of times higher rhan that of being killed by a terrorist attack. You're significantly more likely to be killed by lightening than by terrorists.  Or by a bus.

People don't get their day ruined because they were overheard talking about driving a bus by some dipshit.

The way you beat terrorism is very simple: don't be intimidated.  The security you've had all along can and does stop most attacks. It gets better all the time. No need for anything crazy on top.  Realise that it is impossible to stop all attacks,  and dont allow yourself to be terrorised.

You've probably seen those annoying ""keep calm and carry on"" T-shirts by now. Do you know where that graphic originally came from? It was a poster that was printed and stored in post offices in England at a time when invasion and occupation by Germany was considered likely. They were to be put up all over the place after occupation to try and help people avoid being intimidated and doing foolish things. 
That's literally the solution here, but the US seems far more interested in raising a generation of people who are afraid of their own shadows.

"I did something once about equally as stupid and I'm embarrassed to share it...

Okay I'll share it. Short version is a guy walks up to my car window and asks for money and a ride. He gave some sob story about his car breaking down and his daughter having pneumonia and is at the children's hospital or whatever (we are close by a major university medical center). I drove a guy who came up to my window to where he wanted to go (a somewhat SECLUDED area)... Oh and I also went to an ATM to give him 40 bucks.

Don't ask why I did it. What makes it worse was that I was sure he was conning me. All the signs were there--changing his story a bit, slowly changing the destination he needed to be, NO car around where I dropped him off, etc. ""but also what if he wasn't lying? What if he really needed help?"" I told myself. 

Never doing that again. I could have gotten robbed or something. I like to think he didn't rob me because he felt immense pity for this stupidass guy driving him around a few blocks and giving him money. I dunno. Maybe I felt particularly optimistic about humanity that day, and wanted to give my fellow human the benefit of the doubt and trust that he was a good person who needed help. Of course at this point ""good person"" simply meant ""not going to rob me at gunpoint.""

I'm such a fucking idiot."

Either this is gross negligence on the custodial staff and is grounds for termination or these kids brought in their own chemicals


Edit: also bleach is not just under lock and key, but under way way more lock and key than any other product"
