They actually should've respected your authoritah
"OP: Doc, my heart isnt working correctly.
Doc: Have you tried to turn it off and on again?"
"If you haven't already, email them back with an apology, and explain that what you said was just a joke in reference to a TV show. (I don't know if providing a link to the clip would help or hurt you) Then say you know the joke was inappropriate for the office but you were excited to go home and see your family, and you forgot that you were in a professional setting rather than among friends. Then apologise one more time in the Sincerely line, and say you hope this doesn't damage your workplace relationship or something. Also the cakes sound like a good idea. Lots of them so they can take them home to their kids maybe. 

Or you could just cook them in a chili and feed them to your other coworkers, idk. 

Edeet: holy shit my most popular comment. Thanks, but now I understand the phrase ""RIP my inbox"" 

Edoot #2: A couple of comments have made me realise that saying ""I forgot I was in a workplace and not with friends"" sounds kind of hurtful, like you're insinuating these people weren't your friends. I didn't mean to imply that, I was just going by what my mom always said to me ""I'm not your friend I'm your mother"" and basically thought that those ladies were your coworkers and not your friends, OP. Their email made it seem like there was a very clear line. What you could say instead, similar to what u/CaptainFourpack suggested is, ""I felt so comfortable with you all that/I consider you all friends and I momentarily forgot my professionalism"" "
"Holy fuck, dude"
"Piss, shit, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.

What about the truck driver?  Did they just bail?
"Yes, she took off."
"By the end of the third paragraph all I was thinking is, today this guy fucked up by not writing a formal contract. "
"No worries just show them an episode or two of the show...
Preferably the one where Cartman makes a kid eat his parents. "
There are some things that are worth paying others to do.  I have never even attempted this on my dog and this just proves it was the correct decision. Money well spent.
"&gt; TIFU by almost getting run over by a car trying to hide my junk from my sister.

Sounds like an amusing incest free TIFU

"OP:

"This happens sometimes even to the pros.  Next time hold a paper towel over the butthole before expressing, it will catch most of it.  You learn to kind of stand to the side while you're doing it, and if you get good at it you can kinda twist your hips, shuffle your feet around and rotate your index finger around to hook onto the anal gland on the other side.  This way you don't have to reenter which means less discomfort for the dog.  Also invest in some waterless shampoo for quick cleanup, just spray on a rag and wipe the butt down, and some pet safe grooming spray.  Also gloves and Vaseline for lube of course.  Our clinic charges 18 dollars for an expression, and some pups need it once a month.  Ugh I have a really gross job."
"That's what you get for hiding porn like an amateur. You need multiple levels of protection:

1. Hidden folder sounding like a system generated folder.
2. Rename extensions. Make it *.ini to make it look like a system file. 
3. Inconspicuous file names - system32.ini, game14.bat etc etc. 


Umm, that reminds me, need to spend some time to review system69.ini. 

EDIT: This is what I used to do back in the day - when Pentium 3 and 256MB RAM would get /r/pcmasterrace wet and a 20GB hard drive was yuge! So, all you teens can stop telling me about your 256 bit encryption to save porn. Don't have the need to store porn anymore - crowdsource my daily fap material from some fine subreddits. "

You know, since it's **BURNED DOWN TO THE GROUND**."

"How u filed police report with description. Can you imagine your parents grief and sisters (wrongful) guilt?

Is that why you were trying so desperately to hide your junk from her?

"Get her a manual car, anytime I drive my parents car I find the temptation to check my phone at red lights and stuff because they drive an automatic, in my own car I really can't handle my phone since I have to shift gears so frequently, it's a great way to ensure your kid isn't likely to touch their phone while driving "

"At least send him an itemised bill.

"So, one day I was packing my lunch for work - a classic peanut butter &amp; jelly sandwich. I grabbed a zip lock laying on the counter, threw the sandwich in and headed to work. Lunch time rolls around and I am pregnant and starving. I take a big ol' bite out of my sandwich and immediately chomp down on something hard. My first thought is ""I didn't use crunchy peanut butter, did I?"". I chomp once more to confirm. NO, there's no way that's a peanut! I work the object out of the mouthful of sticky peanut butter I'm nearly chocking on, spit it out into my hand and realize it's a tooth! A fucking tooth! Apparently  my son had lost his tooth the night before, stuck it in a zip lock and left it on the counter. Still nearly puke every time he brings it up!!"
"This is actually pretty common.  I've been an exterminator for a few summers, and I get at least 3 houses every summer that get hundreds or thousands of wasps in their attic.  They never want to bomb it, so I go up there with a bee suit and a few cans of wasp death juice and spray the shit out of the nest.  I don't give a fuck who you are, even in a bee suit, it's absolute hell.  You're always worried about a wasp crawling through the zipper at the back of your neck, getting stung in the face, and not being able to take the bee suit off or kill the wasp or get out of the small opening in the attic fast enough to not get stung 30,000 times in the face. I don't get paid enough for that shit.  For the love of God, don't build your homes on Indian burial grounds, don't insult anybody you think MIGHT be a gypsy, and if you get even one wasp in your house, GET THAT SHIT CHECKED."

"We had a park in the neighborhood I grew up in, and the guy who lived across the street hated kids playing in said park.  (Which had jungle gyms, etc.)

First, he got signs installed that said no ball playing.  Then when kids still played ball there, he would bring his rifle out on his porch to clean it.

Of course he had to check the sites on it, and how could he help it if kids happened to be down barrel.  He also needed to make sure the shells still fit after he cleaned it.   He never pulled the trigger, but we all expected it to happen one day.  

Anyway, it all worked out when he slipped on a puddle on a Septa train and broke his back.  (He was an employee.)  He sued Septa, and got over a million dollars.  Old Herby Herbert moved out of our poor ass neighborhood.   I like to think that he's now pointing his gun at kids from his new mansion. "
"The medication they used to stop the heart is adenosine.  it's really crazy to push.  no matter how many times I've given it, that period of asytole freaks me out.  OP said that he had an irregular fast heart rate which is a type of supraventricular tachycardia but more specifically it's likely it was atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  Adenosine doesn't do much for that.  so they proceeded with synchronized cardioversion which translates into defibrillating a very specific part of the the cardiac rhythm.

"You didn't mess up, he did. He took advantage of a good, kind person because you have a valuable skill. Don't let it get you down. My fiancé is also a plumber and will often go out of his way to help people in desperate times (like elderly with no heat or water with little or no money). Sometimes he'll see others in the field with better, newer work trucks or equipment, and see how ""cut-throat"" and callous their ethics are and say that's how he should be because that's how they got what they have (even though he does just fine, he just gets that envy every once in a while like we all do, grass is always greener, ya know!) His good deeds and amazing heart always comes back to him eventually. So even though you lost out on this one for now (which I know, does totally suck), perhaps something somewhere will come from it...maybe one of those other workers will call you for a job or pass your name on :)"

TBF, I should've known that saying ""oh, sorry, the old ball and chain"" as a jokey retort probably wasn't the best idea.

"&gt;I'm 15 and my sister is 17. It recently got pretty warm where I'm at meaning it was time for us to go at it again. 
&gt;
&gt;This all happened three days ago. We had been at it for maybe ten minutes, when I had already ran out. She started pegging me, and I ran away from her. We were in our backyard which is filled with trees.
&gt;
&gt; so there I was butt naked in my backyard. I ran to the street away from her trying to cover myself.  My plan was to get across the street and into the tall grass (there's an empty lot on the other side of the street) and wait there for her to toss me. This is where it all went even more south.
&gt;
&gt;I heard my sister scream my name. I stopped to look back at her. The next thing I knew my sister was standing over me, and when I opened my eyes she relieved. She told me to stay put, and then covered my privates and helped me up. Once we got inside she laid me on the couch.
&gt;
&gt;I'm lucky that my sister is amazing because she basically saved my butt in this whole ordeal.
&gt;
&gt;TL;DR: I ran to hide my junk from my sister and ended up coming, and in the end my sister ended up seeing my junk anyways so it was all to no avail. "

"Okay, well backup here... You're not obligated to spend time with your roommate, you don't have to be his friend. HOWEVER, you cannot avoid your fair share of the responsibilities.

You and your roommate need to set out a chores schedule and stick to it. Beyond that, do whatever you want (respectfully).

It was awesome, but adenosine can be scary shit."

"It's pretty uncommon. It does come off as rude, because instead of talking about it as adults, ""Hey, what you said in the office today offended us because of X, I was wondering why you chose those words to address us when we thought we were friendly with each other"" you jump to the conclusion that you're right, and that you are -so- in the right that you don't even need to discuss anything with the person. 


A good person would apologize, if they don't feel they need to apologize, asking for one isn't going to get them to reconsider. If they don't even know they did something wrong, like OP, demanding an apology in the way they did is a sure way to make tensions worse in most situations.

And if it doesn't work I get to fucking shock you (if you're unstable) or give you a different drug (cardizem if you're stable). It will usually work if it's actually SVT and not A-fib. 

I really like my job when stuff like this happens, but I'm mainly saving people from their minor inconveniences."

"Turn This TIFU Into A Job Hunt In 3 Easy Steps:


* When you return, place a tube of Vagisil^® at the end of your desk.

"EMT here.

You did everything right.  A weak pulse is better described as a ""questionable"" pulse.  At a certain point you can't be sure if it's the patient's weak pulse, or your own pulse in your fingertips.

You say you moved him - presumably to the floor.  If he didn't wake up through all of that, then you were right to perform CPR.

One helpful note: when checking responsiveness, don't forget ""responsive to painful stimuli"".  Use things like: a hard sternal rub with your knuckles, pinching the shoulder muscle (traps) really hard, or laying a pen across the base of a fingernail and applying firm pressure.

"You actually still mighy have saved his life. The Army shipped my father back to a hospital from overseas on a priority flight because his sleep apnea could have killed him quickly. His Darth Vader mask is giving him the best sleep he can remember ever having too.

Sure, you kinda fucked up with the CPR, but you inadvertently did some serious good. No need to feel bad about this at all, you tried to save his life one way and ended up potentially doing so in another way."
"My sister was 8 or 9 and some lady in a truck ran her right the fuck over. The lady was on her phone and bailed hard afterwards.

What's super fucked is my sister was on the sidewalk, and the lady was backing up from a daycare after dropping her kids off.

By some miracle, my sister survived. She got up after being run over by a truck, walked a few houses home, came inside and collapsed in the doorway. She had some fucked up organs and shit but made a good recovery. 

The lady? Well once my sister was better, she saw the truck again. They noticed us trying to get their plate number and sped the fuck off, didn't see them again.

Fuck people who hit and run 

Edit: to everyone saying I am embellishing or asking why I didn't do more, or how we knew she was dropping her kids off.

I was 10 or 11. I don't know if she got charged. We assume she was dropping off her kids because the house was a known daycare and when we saw her again it's what she was doing. I don't know if my parents or the police approached the daycare or the lady, as I said I was 10 or 11. 

The owners of the daycare were cunts so I imagine they wouldn't be helpful anyway. When I was like 8 or 9 my brother and I were playing on our street and spilt something on their driveway. They yelled at me and forced me to clean their entire driveway while they watched threatening to call the cops.

It sucks you got burned on that.  I think everyone has to get burned a few times to learn that lesson, but it really destroys your faith in humanity when it comes at the hands of people who, on the surface, seem like nice people.  

I'm a vindictive bastard though.  I would have said I'd finish the job, then sabotage the original work as well as leave a fiasco as far as the remaining work, such that he'd spend double or triple ripping it all out and having it redone.
