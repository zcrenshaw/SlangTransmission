"The amount of people I work with who don't know how to take a screenshot, open a new tab, use a search function, Google is your friend, etc. General sort of computer stuff that people should def know how to do if you work on computers all day. 

BUT I have had to explain to people, at least twice, what Amazon is. "
"Had LASIK done last Jan for the Navy so I can be flight qualified. Def weird to smell your eye burning. The crazy part was when the flipped up the cornea flap without telling me, it felt like my whole vision spun around and then disappeared but my body didn't move. Almost made me sick. The eye scratchiness was weird for a couple days, but I now have 20/15 vision and I can be a pilot. 10/10 would recommend. Feels amazing not having to put in contacts or wear glasses (and waking up and random points in the night with perfect vision is awesome)."
