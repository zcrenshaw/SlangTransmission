That doesn't sound subtle at all. I'm actually a little shocked a health care professional would've said/done that.
"I'm a bit appalled that the focus is drawn to OP and his power sets rather than the actual problem...

There's nothing wrong with powersets if done properly and under the right conditions. If someone is hogging the equipment when it's busy and they take major breaks in between, then yes, he shouldn't be doing that and he's a douchebag. But OP has mentioned numerous times now the gym was practically empty. I don't know where you're all working out, but in all the gyms I've gone to, asking someone to do a set in between is hardly a taboo. The attack on him and his character makes me believe it was less to do about his powersets. The gentleman obviously have unresolved issues.

"""I'm all for gay rights but why do you gays have to rub it in my face?!""

^ Such hypocrisy. Everyday is Heterosexual Day: most movies are about the guy getting the girl (even the cutesy talking animal movies for children have the male/female dynamic); most mainstream music is about hetero relationships; and most magazines are all about the above too. If anyone has an ""agenda"", it is the straights."

"He was right about packing your bags and leaving. If you expect to live a happy life, you'll have to do it on your own terms, not his, and not anyone else's. As tough as it sounds, you are 24 and you're an adult. You are responsible, solely, for your own happiness. I understand that it's traumatic to have your family turn on you, and some of that pain will stay with you forever, but taking action to remove yourself from a toxic environment and into a healthy one is your only recourse."
"This is one of the scariest stories I've read. What a horrible person!
Thank god you are negative, OP.

And no, he wasn't protecting you, he was never thinking about you. The least he could do was tell you about his status.
Even though he is such a horrible person and a liar, I don't hope he dies. But life knows its ways.
But OP, most people are not that way. It's going to be hard, but try not developping trust issues. He gave you too much to worry about, you don't need this too.

I hope you get better and are able to move happily on."
"""Don't you feel weird that it is another guy though? ""


Haha that one is just do plainly and obviously dumb that I malfunction and can't even respond to it. "
Like I can't wait to kiss him... I have no idea what it's going to be like
"It's funny that he doesn't wanna seem like a ""controlling insecure jealous guy,"" because that is exactly what he is being. If your husband is effeminate like you say he is, I fail to understand why the boyfriend feels so threatened by him.

You did the right thing by turning down his request and ending the conversation. I think to expect something like that is absolutely ridiculous- no one should have their friendships controlled by a significant other. In regards to your sister, I would say that it's not necessary for you to say anything. You put the ball back in her boyfriend's court, so if HE is uncomfortable with who she makes friends with, then HE can man up and say something to her directly, and that will be an indication of his true character. If he says and does nothing, then the friendship can go on as continued."
"""But you don't look gay?""  
  
Always in that questioning tone, like they think there's a reason, like I escaped the compulsory bedazzling or it's laundry day and I had to borrow some straight clothes while my gay clothes were in the wash."
OP should just say he's not interested. His sexual orientation is nobody's business and there's no need to shove his deviant lifestyle down anyone's throat. 
You did the right thing. It's time to move on to better things and NEVER look back.
"That's good; wishing someone dead is a pretty seriously negative place.  You have got to steer away from that.   

I've encountered liars, and deceitful people.  But this is an extreme.  I've never heard of this level of betrayal.   I understand how it could be hard for you to trust again; but from this point on it's extremely unlikely you'll ever encounter worse.  

I'm sorry, but he's a terrible person.  A genuinely bad person.  

So a couple words of advice though:

1) Do make sure to discuss the ending with him. It will help you get closure if you make it a discussion.   Even if that's hard for you.  This is your opportunity to confront him for the pain he caused you: an important step on the road to healing.  And yes, he'll likely try to spin it or lie his way through it.   But now you know better, and that will only remind you why you're doing the best thing.   

2) Forgive him.  Not in the sense of ""oh, it's okay, I'll pretend it never happened"".  You don't have to be friends with him.  But you *DO* have to ""release the anger"".   You have to forgive him for wronging you to let the burden off your own heart and soul.   Life is hard, the journey is arduous; it's best to travel light.   Anger and hate are burdensome.  And forgiveness will help you learn to trust and love again.   Not him, obviously but when someone who is good to you comes along.   

3) Go ahead and get tested again in a couple months.  If you've been taking PEP, but were already infected, you could have brought antibodies below the detectable threshold yourself.     Probably not, after four months, but just to be ABSOLUTELY sure, get tested again in a while.  

4) The most important bit of advice:  DO NOT PUNISH YOURSELF.   Look in the mirror, repeat after me  *It is not my fault, I am not to blame for this*.   You know it, intellectually, but still in your mind, now you're going to be thinking ""How could I not see this?  Why did I believe him when he told me that?"".  STOP THAT.   You believed him because he's a great liar, and you loved and trusted him.  You are a good person, you were not being naive, or stupid.   He was manipulating you, lying to you, and betraying you on a regular basis.  This is all on him.   It's his wrongdoing, not yours, so do not blame yourself (At the same time, don't forget about #2, let go of the anger).   

5) After you put your heart back together, glue the little bits in place again, you're going to have scar tissue there.  That can stick with you for a long time; life has a funny way of beating us up little bits at a time, but you got the emotional thrashing of your life just now.   You're going to remember that pain for awhile when you start thinking about dating again; and you're going to be inclined to avoid that pain again.  By not letting people in, by not trusting people, by avoiding things when they get too close/serious.   By even bailing at the first sign of imperfection, whatever.    Try not to do that.   Don't be afraid to get hurt again; because real fulfillment only comes if we take those risks.   You will learn to love again.   

Having said that, I'm sorry you had to go through this.  I know it might seem meaningless to you right now, and you may even be sick of hearing it, but I'm going to say it: It's going to be okay.  You are going to get through this, and it will be okay again. You will be good again.   Believe it.   "

"Are you comparing yourself to straight people in terms of relationships?  You're actually quite far ahead of other gay men your age.  There are tons of studies about how gay men experience delayed adolescence due to so many coming out at a later age.  For example, a guy who came out at 22 might not be ready for a long term relationship at 24 compared to a straight person who started dating at 16 or even earlier.

Do you have a good paying job and a fairly independent housing situation? You're also better off than a lot of people in your age bracket.  A 23 year old college-educated guy working a minimum wage job while living with his potentially homophobic parents might not be able to be the kind of boyfriend he wants to be as he's not yet somewhat financially stable.

"I went into my doctors office because of an ear infection. I haven't been to the doctors in awhile cause I didn't have insurance plus I was healthy before it with no serious problems. 

I had an ear infection for a month and decided to see a doctor, they asked if I was sexually active and I said yeah. I had a boyfriend for the past 2 years and we fool around here and there ( no penetration though, mostly blowjobs and handjobs).

They took blood after I said yeah, when he came back he said I was that I was HIV+. I was flabbergasted. I had so many questions but no answers. I could barely talk after that. 

Some time later, after I got on medication for it, I was told that I recently contracted it. Only person I been with is my boyfriend and only needles I used was at the doctor's office. My boyfriend took a home test and it came back negative. I told him to see a doctor but he hasn't. 

I'm only 19 at the moment. It only takes 30 days minimum for HIV to become noticeable. I have had suicidal thoughts but never acted on it. Also, my boyfriend and I are monogamous, so i doubt he would cheat, but you can't rule it out. "

"My brother asked me that like 3 or 4 times during my coming out conversation with him. I told him if he asked that quetion one more time I'd give him a detailed description of how I know. Needless to say, he didn't ask again.  "

"This is above your pay grade. As long as he's able, he's going to throw up walls so as not to confront himself or have his family question. You're just collateral damage so long as you allow it. And you're correct, he will never fully love you as long as hates and is embarrassed by himself and unable to live an honest, authentic life. 

The best lesson you could ever give him is that he needs to be true to himself and to not drag someone else back in closet with him. He doesn't have to come out for you, he isn't going to love himself because you want him to do so; but, he'll sure as hell learn that his (lack of) actions have consequences so long as you stop letting him dictate the relationship. Let him know why and then end it. Yes, it will be painful but you deserve happiness with someone without the fear and self-loathing. "
"i would out the shit out of him. i hate, HATE, when people are outed because its on them. outing someone who doesnt want to be is one of the biggest taboos gays have. however, fuck a hypocrite that will slow homosexuals drive to equality but go and be secretly gay.  if any anti gay politician fucks guys, everyone should know about it so they cant continue being a piece of shit.  non politicians who are secretly gay? who cares. its the ones who have a voice on public policy i have a problem with. i have no sympathy for hypocrites. "
"The same reason they are not sexually attracted to women. 

Also;   most feminine gay guys have interests in so many things that many other non-feminine gay guys find boring and not interesting at all.

Straight guys do the same thing. They have their group of friends who share their interests and pretty much ignore other straight guys who don't share their interests.

Just because feminine guys are men too and also gay isn't their free ticket into any other gay man's interest. "
"But you kissed and had willingly had sex with a man you were attracted to. It can be one man or a million guys, it doesn't change that fact that you're most likely bisexual. It's not like it has to be 50/50 ratio of having sex with men and women to be bi, it can be 30 girls and 1 guy and it still counts as being bisexual

"I would second this. I think it has to do with insecurity. As gay men we're often accused of not being manly enough, those singled out for ridicule in the schoolyard are usually the more feminine gays because they can't hide it as easily as the more gender conforming gays who are able to come out on their own terms later on. So, when we come out, we overcompensate by saying we're ""masc4masc"" but eventually, as you grow older your insecurities wane, and you start appreciating the variety of people. 

I used to hate drag queens. I thought they were everything I hated in the gay community, the cattiness, the flamboyancy, the in-your-face faggotry etc... Now, I absolutely love drag queens. I love what lady bunny said on the outlist. Drag queens were the ones at the forefront of gay liberation, they were the ones who said ""fuck no, here's a brick in your fucking face!"" 

Relax. You are who you are and people will love you for who you are. Some won't, some will... but that's about them, not you. You'll be alright. And you'll even find out that you'll change as a person too. Maybe you grow to be perceived as more gender confirming, or not, who knows... but you are you, that is truer than true, there is no one on earth that is youer than you, and all that shit. "
You aren't less masculine for taking on these tasks or for being interested in good clothing. These are stereotypical gender roles that are making you feel self-conscious. The fact of the matter is that you two both have lots of work to do to keep your daily lives running. You're providing for your guy and taking on household responsibilities. There's nothing necessarily feminine or masculine about this. Someone has to do these things.

"I don't think people realize just how prevalent this sort of thing is, even in areas where homosexuality is accepted and openly supported. The same goes true for racism and other 'isms unfortunately. Things get better over time, for the most part, but many people who aren't a part of the communities affected are indoctrinated to see it as ""all better"" once this or that major event happens. Even people in affected communities think this at times because they are in specific areas with blinders on and unable to see it when it happens."

If we dont challenge the behaivour, how are we supposed to weed it out. Suprised that no-one said anything to defend you at the gym.

dont even understand those trying to justify him hogging, even if he was or wasnt calling  him a fag , verbally abusing him and threatening him because he was *allegedly* 'selfish at the gym'  is no reason for all that hate, clearly his hate runs for gay people not because he was ""hogging"" equipment, but that was his pathetic trigger. 


and can we be serious when a place is ""dead"" you know it's dead, you're not gonna say it's dead if it isn't. like work, or the  cinema, or a party...you know. The guy could have just approached him calmly but no he caused a scene and brought his fellow oldies to help him. 

mate if you don't challenge the behaviour like i said before, people are  going to think it's acceptable as many people on here are kinda displaying.  Just make sure you wont be in any danger from doing it.  why  should you change gyms when you did nothing wrong and acted calmly, this kinda shit bugs the crap outta me.  

its like racism, if you dont challenge it, it aint gonna stop.

2. He agreed to have sex with a guy under the influence of drugs or alcohol. He later claimed it was rape because of shame. 

3. Maybe he was right that it was a dream but this doesn't seem likely to me at all.

4. He lied to you about the whole thing. This also seems very unlikely."
Is this some weird kinda r/humblebrag type shit lol?
"5'5"" and all I've ever done is top taller guys

First guy I was with was 6'4"""
"The issue isn't the lack of representation really. The actual issues are a combination of the negativity towards being represented ""Gosh ANOTHER gay story?"" ""Ew that is so gross"" ""Oh look the gays forced another poor producer to push them into a story they don't belong"", and how the vast majority of gay representation is either against the LGBT+ community or highly inaccurate of what the people are like. When we do get massive representation that isn't just a cameo it has to be on a ""No they aren't lesbians, they are gender-less space rocks"" (nothing against SU, they are doing a great job, just wish they didn't have to fall back on this to make main characters gay and explore their lives).
The annoying part is at least I would rather not have a ton of media that is ""look into the life of this GAY person"". I would rather have ""Look into the life of this person, oh btw they are gay but this has little to no effect on anything."" and having more minor character that are gay, but again it is no big deal. Aka I want a better representation of sexuality in real life."
Wrong brown eye
"My buddy pulled this stunt so every time there was something regarding straight sexuality on TV I pointed it out to him. (There's way more than you think and way more than I thought.) 

He finally got the hint. I was still pissed though because I never bring up gay things in real life, others bring them up. "
"Wow, they skipped the group of people that HIV/AIDS most affects? Because they didn't want to see guys ""booty popping""? Jesus, I thought people in the medical field were educated."
"All the common ones have been said but my new favorite is ""Atleast you're not faggy, I couldn't deal with that"" "
"Straight guys have been accompanying their gay friends to gay bar for a long time. Nowadays, it is becoming increasingly common. It's all good. Go for it. "
"I probably shouldn't have. But I was feeling scorned and I wanted to jab my ex.

Was it right? No 

Can I change it? No 
"
It's like kissing death 
Sodom and Gomorrah
My dick. 
"Thanks for the supportive comment, man. I feel like a lot of the people who have a bigger issue with me super setting than with what I was called are not very serious lifters, and they may be projecting onto me some grievances they have at their own gyms with guys who truly are equipment hogging D-bags."
Straight white dudes have been playing that card for millennia. Play that card and deal me in. 
This question reminds me of Yahoo Answers.
Username scares me away.
"Surprised by what a dirty little fucker my sub-conscious can be. Them sex dreams, man."
"For me it's by far asking questions like I understand every gay person in the world. ""Why do some gay guys do X?"" ""Why are gays always like Y?"" I don't fucking know Gretchen go ask him yourself you're obviously okay wasting my time with this shit, take it to him and get an answer. "
"Just be like ""Yaaaaass daddy spank me"" and they'll never do it again. (Unless they're gay themselves and want you ;))"
It's rare to find a short guy who's not into tall men.
"smoking does nothing to help you 'live a little'. That's an incredibly immature thing to say.

A good family friend was just diagnosed with lung cancer. He's a father of two, a wonderful kind person, and one of my father's best friends. He just lost his job and the medical bills will be enormously expensive. He's young, mid 50s, and he has maybe- *maybe*- five years left. 

I have three or four cigarettes left from the last pack I bought. Tonight I'm going to finish them off with some friends, and never buy another pack again. It's just not worth it."
And tell us how it was.
I don't think the story could be much worse. It's like a bad movie that I didn't ask for a part in. You're right; he wasn't protecting me in the way a normal person would. I don't hope he dies either. Even after all of this.
"That kinda seems like an issue. It becomes a problem whenever it negatively impacts his life. If he's missing work, ruining relations with family and friends, etc. then it is definitely a problem."
"My best friend from ~~a~~ high school. A beautiful intellect, smart as a whip, very athletic (soccer player), and incredibly funny....and also from an incredibly strict Islamic family. 

We spent every moment we could together, he even signed my last yearbook with something along the lines of ""if I could repeat the last four years, I'd make sure you were standing next to me the whole time"" or something young and sentimental like that. 

I loved everything about him. I loved his personality and his physical appearance, and of course like almost every gay man on the planet, the fact that he was my best friend made it so much easier to fall in love with him. 

We kissed once. Behind the school, in the park we walked through every day for four years to get home. I had come out a few months before, and he stood by my side the entire time (but frankly, this being Toronto, I never really had a difficult time being a gay kid in school, even all those years ago). 

It was sudden, We had walked on the ""other side of the creek,"" that cut through the park; the side that had no pavement and was mostly just trees and bushes. We came to the same spot we used to chill at and talk for hours, and he just sort of leaned in and kissed me. I was shocked, and it was like every wish I had, had come true. 

But of course this story doesn't have a happy ending. That would be too ideal. We both got up, got our stuff, and went our separate ways. After a really long shower and a 2 hour long ""but what do I do now,"" conversation with a very good female friend, I reached out to him (on MSN messenger)  in my naive high school manner, thinking I could make this euphoria last. 

Me: I like you, I've liked you for three years, we only have a week of school left, and I don't want this to end. 

Him: (after a good 15 minute delay) I'm supposed to like girls.

That was the last thing my first love ever said to me. He dodged me at school for that last week, never talked to me over the whole summer, and I moved away to school in September. 

I mourned that one for a few years. He was just so goddamned perfect, and frankly it wasn't until I met my husband (four years after this) that I really ever loved anyone again. Oh sure, there were many tricks and even long term bfs along the way, but no man has ever made me feel as complete as my best friend and my husband. 

He's married to a woman now, and they have two children. "
In the second half of my last year of high school I met someone and we started dating and I've been with the same person all through my 4 years of undergrad. I'm graduating this year and I'm thinking of asking him to marry me after I start grad school (so in the next year or two).
"What's the hardest part about rollerblading?

Telling your parents you're gay."
"Be sure to act confused by euphemisms, too. It works the best when you get them to be as explicit and blunt as possible."
"Yes, insofar as I want them to have a profession that they're dedicated to as opposed to someone that hops between dead-end jobs, never finding a good fit. I want to be able to talk about work stuff over dinner every night and the conversation be interesting as opposed to being a bitchfest because he hates his job. His profession should be one of the positive qualities about him."
"It's important to know that majority of people have this exact same fear when they start working out at a gym. Yes, those first few times can be a bit uncomfortable. But, soon after you will realize nobody is judging you. If anything they are happy for you. "
"Just came to comment this exact question.

I always answer with, ""Well we both have a dick (or a penis for those I think can't handle the word dick) so neither of us are the woman.""

Then I usually get, ""You know what I mean!""

Then I go Tumblr on them and say, ""You  shouldn't go into social constructs laid out by society!""

Then at this point I either get a stare or jokingly follow-up with, ""The man is the one whoever pays for dinner that night."" 

Answering questions as a gay man can be fun sometimes. üòÇ"
"how do you even know he really said this? lol.. the fact that your friend thought the need to tell you that seems kinda weird period. 

Like i'd probably be thinking, why are you telling me this? some people just like to start drama and whatever mutual friend told you that your other friend said that would make me a little suspicious of  him. "
