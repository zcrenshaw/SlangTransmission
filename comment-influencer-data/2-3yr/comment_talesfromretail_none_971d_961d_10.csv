"I think the best off the cuff comeback I heard was when a cashier announced a total of $6.66 and the customer started freaking out big time...

Cashier:  No Ma'am, it's OK!  Your giving the evil to the store and cleansing it from yourself, you would only have to worry if your CHANGE was $6.66.

Woman happily accepted that and paid."
Wha-? I... She... What in the actual fuck? I feel like I just entered the fucking twilight zone by reading that last bit.
I forgot that this sub was also for nice stories. Those should get a special tag
The 25 on the gift card won't give that away at all! /s
"Oh that's great. I'll definitely remember that for next time. It reminds of a common occurrence, when people bring in broken hematite rings all the time and ask for refunds, but we're supposed to explain the ring broke because it had absorbed too much negative energy and had done its job, not because the wearer was careless or because the ring is made of a not-very-sturdy material. That always makes them feel better and they'll happily buy a new one. "
I'M JUST GOING TO SHOUT SOMETHING AT YOU SO THAT YOU GIVE ME CHOCOLATE!
"""OOOHHHHHH!!!  I thought you were speaking French. When, in actuality, you were speaking French!!!  I'm sorry.  My bad.""

"Hi, former vehicle rental employee here!

Why don't you guys have a little sheet they need to sign that shows fuel gauge, odometer, and any dents/scratches/etc on the vehicle, and have the customer sign it, acknowledging the damage/amounts? I only ask because the company I worked for had a two-layer sheet that we gave the customer and stapled with the rental agreement as well, so we had our computerized records as well as a written copy that we could tie to whomever rented the vehicle to which customer.

Not criticizing, just asking!"
"This reminds me of a story from when I was working at a major electronics store. A man was in the store trying to purchase a gaming system and some games and only had cash on him and had come up about $15 short. The man was very disheveled and wearing old and ratty paint spattered and stained clothes and looked like he was really down on his luck. He only had the cash and had apparently forgotten his wallet and was sadly about to put the gaming system back when he said it was for his kid's birthday party later that day.

The cashier, who was a down on her luck single mom with several kids, felt bad for him and pulled out the last of her cash and paid the difference, leaving her with only like $2 or $3 left to buy her lunch and get through the day.

A few days later, the man came back in and we found out the full story. Apparently, this guy was a pretty well off businessman and it turns out that when he served his wife for divorce several years prior (for cheating on him while he was working and paying all the family's bills and before he made a lot of his money) she fled the state to the other side of the country with his son, who was 2 at the time. When he came into the store, he had been painting a bedroom in his house because after 8 years, the mom was broke and reached out for money and he was able to regain custody of his, now 10 year old son and he wanted to buy the game system so he'd feel at home in his new house with his dad that he didn't remember.

The customer took the single mom cashier out to lunch to repay her kindness (since he knew she was using her lunch money to help him) and ended up giving her a job managing one of the locations of his business with better hours, pay, and more responsibility. And then I heard several years later that they ended up getting married. . . "
"I hope that she doesn't realize until she gives it to her friend.

Friend: Oh, Â£25 to spend at the bookstore! How thoughtful.

Her: HOW DID YOU KNOW???"
You shouldn't have dropped the price. That's rude of him
"Those people annoy me so much. Just because I am in here does not mean that you get to be as well. I own my shop. I come in 3+ hours before I officially open to customers so that I can sew and prep things without interruption. Sometimes I also stay after closing. I had to put up a curtain between my work room and the main room because if people came early/late and could see me moving around, they would bang on the windows.

I am usually good about remembering to turn off the light in my ironing room (it is in the front and has the huge neon OPEN sign in it) and the other front room light, and the workroom light is always on. One night I forgot the ironing room light and about an hour after I closed, someone started knocking on that window. Incessantly. I ignored it. It finally stopped... but then started up again on my front door. Thinking that maybe it was one of the owners of the other two shops in my building with an emergency, I went out... Nope. It was a customer who not only wanted to pick up the order that was ready a few days earlier, but she wanted to drop stuff off too. I tried to act nice, but I think she could tell I was pissed. Thankfully she didn't need to try anything on. I was just like ""I've already closed up the computer for the night, so I will ring this new stuff up tomorrow when I open again.""

... Then I had another guy show up about 10 minutes prior to opening. He didn't want to wait, so he spent a few minutes cramming his Harley Davidson jacket through my mail slot. ... Only to return again 15 minutes after I opened to ask if i could have it ready same day. ... Why not just bring it into the shop at that time instead of potentially wrecking it by cramming it into the mail slot? People."
"I'm hoping she'll leave the shop and have a ""d'oh"" moment when she realises, ha."
"&gt; I'm actually doing you a favour by converting your change to a note, I was hoping you'd be able to give me $6in change for this $5 note

um.....  *what.*"
"She sounds like exactly the sort of person who had you have opened the battery package and placed one in the remote would have said ""Oh good, I'll have a new one!"""
"Well, sometimes this doesn't work the way you expect. Oftentimes if you tell the truth, the associate's hands are tied.  But if you ""lie"" the associate is allowed the benefit of the doubt (wink-wink, nod-nod) and can run with your lie.

Not every associate or job is like yours."
"Honestly, at that age, it probably was just lesson learned. It's not like that arrest followed them through life, preventing them from getting jobs. They were underage and probably just got in big trouble from their parents, and their records were wiped clean or sealed when they became adults. 

The one who was following along with his buddy's plan hopefully learned to stand up for himself in the future, because, *consequences.* Don't feel bad about this at all, valuable life lessons were imparted."
Sigh. I also spent many years working for **[a national news company]** and was appalled at how many family members thought they could pull stunts like this. Even my mother had no idea what I really did in the course of my work. 
"Ah, the prankster has failed to realize that customer service has made people dead on the inside."
"Perks are a privilege, not a right."
"""We went up to your other store, and they didn't have any! They acted like they never sold them to begin with, but I kept telling them that YOUR store downstairs has it, so should you! They were so rude to us, it was completely unprofessional. Heck, they even spelled the store name *wrong*, how do they even have a job!?"""
I need to get into a line of work where people regularly give me $5 and scurry away in laughter.
"I feel terrible for that little girl. She's probably a very sweet kid, but her mother is reinforcing negative behavior for a chance to complain. Then again, I wonder if the money was even for the daughter, or if she was just using the poor little girl as an excuse to make a quick buck."
"""My appologies, would you like me to get you a manager that does speak French? I can only speak French you see!"" "
"I can remember one day having our city, county, and state officers all at our restaurant at one point. All three were in the drive thru, in that order. I guess they all like tacos."
"""I smoke two joints in the morning I smoke two joints at night. I smoke two joints in the afternoon, it makes me feel alright"" 

That kid was pretty spot on. "
"Wait, in *Canada*, some *Canadians* are shocked when somebody understands French?"
I like it when you don't know if the story will end up being good or bad. Just like when dealing with actual people.
"Yeah, when I did drop it and he tried to get an even steeper discount (trying to sneak the hem into the waist price) I should have changed my mind about the discount."
You should have told her she doesn't get a free cookie for ACTING like a child...
"Then you have the additional issue that you have 20 stolen guns out on the street somewhere.  More likely than not, odds are that those guns will probably end up being sold on the street and used for further criminal activities in the future."
"Not going to lie, but what the lady said almost made me tear up."
Tell him no and force him to watch as you close the door and cram it back out the slot. 
"Sweet comeback, if they had you on speakerphone that would've been perfect."
"Even if it had been a spider, what's with the disinfecting the fridge and throwing out the food? It's a spider - not hepatitis. And her children wouldn't have even known if she didn't make a big deal about it. Does she not know that spiders and insects (and maybe even mice, snakes and birds) have run over her vegetables at one time or another?

I just don't understand how some people are able to navigate life at all. Do they have such easy lives that the slightest anomaly just sends them into a tizzy? 

I hope your store does not give her anything."
"&gt;I've been having nightmares, anxiety and random crying spells the last few days

You are still in some form of shock. If you can, find someone to talk to about this, don't bottle it up or pretend its not happening or it can get worse. Dealing with death is never easy and everyone handles it differently. Feel free to PM me if you want to talk."
Would have been a less awkward experience that way. 
"You can't give customers like that an inch, or they'll take a mile. Props for trying to compromise, but christ I hate people who angle for discounts."
"And even if it would make sense, it wouldn't make sense.

It's quite the opposite, they actually prefer to have coins so they can give change."
"Having worked retail and having read this sub for quite some time, I'm not surprised at all. People suck."
"Thanks! I think that was the only time in my life I ever had a snappy comeback in the moment and not hours later, so I was unreasonably proud of myself."
He's not himself when he's hungry. He should eat a snickers
"WHAT?! 

please please tell me she was exaggerating the allergy (a.k.a. Making it up) just to complain and she didn't actually feed her CHILD something he's allergic to? 
I sure hope the kid's not allergic to peanuts, in case they hand out free cookies somewhere... "
"Haha I wish it said the value on there! It's just a plain one as I can add any amount to it, but it does have a space for her to fill in the value herself. I'd love to see her reaction when she sees it. ""Why on earth would I want to include the value?! One should never know how much one's gift cost!"""
You have nothing to feel guilty about. Definitely did and said what you knew best to say. Overreaction on everyone's part for sure. 
There is some hope for the adults of tomorrow in the children of today...
"Don't really want to link to my work website, but it varied from ugly floral teacup and saucer sets to a commemorative Peter Rabbit mug/plate/bowl set."
"As a British person living back in the good old UK; I'm shocked to hear you've escaped our shores. Get back here at ONCE, young man/lady."
"""I want an Oompa Loompa ***now***, daddy!""

The child is likely going to become Veruca Salt. "
"I really respected my grandfather in all things but this. When he was about 80, he failed the eye test at the DMV - much to my relief. He then went to his optician (who was a quasi-friend), and the optician gave him a note that said he was fine to drive, so the DMV renewed his license. I was livid. Sure, he knew the local roads blindfolded, but he was at the point where if he wasn't sure if the light was red or green (by seeing those big blobs either going through the light already or stopping), he'd just stop and wait for someone to honk at him to go. There's no way he could have seen things like a kid/dog running into the road or a tree branch in the road or even a piece of debris that could cut his tires. My husband was still in school, so he fortunately had the time to drive my grandfather most of the time (to doctors/store/etc.), but I know that he still sneaked out and drove when he felt like it."
The store I work at has the same policy but also never really implemented it. My favorite thing is when people try to return coffee makers or vacuums and tell me they never used it.... and then I open it in front of them and it's full of coffee grinds/dirt. Then they panic and ask for a manager lmfao
"Sounds to me like she would've put them in her remote, exclaimed she would go buy two more but then just walk out batteries in the machine lol."
"What you said: ""Our bathroom is actually in the shop""

What the customer heard: ""blah bathroom blah blah blah blah blah blah. 

"
"This is true. My SO is Asian and in their culture, 4 is a very very bad number. He gets *super* freaked out about it. Brings all kinds of bad luck and death, like you said. "
"sounds serious. guns can get expensive in a hurry, if they managed to get some of the nicer ones, so that sounds like thousands of dollars of losses. "
"Customer: ""I'm right.""

Me: ""No, you're wrong.""

Customer: ""But I think I'm actually right, though.""

Me: ""No, you're really wrong.""

Customer: ""We'll, let's check to see if I'm wrong..."""
"&gt; You would have made a sale.

""No, I wouldn't have... BECAUSE WE DON'T SELL TILES YOU MORON!"" lol"
"Sounds like the dude was trying to prove a point in his own little pea brain. ""They won't sell it to me cheap, I'll just return it and let no one else have it!""

Kudos to your boss and his boss for tossing the grown toddler out of the store when you saw him again."
He might have needed help with that too
"Yep, pretty much. To avoid being political as much as possible, some individuals from predominantly French-speaking provinces (provinces are the equivalent of 'states' for you Americans out there) assume that most people out in the west of Canada only understand English. The further out west you are, the less French and more English it gets. So if you sound very English and you happen to speak French in retail, one of two things tend to happen: Either the French speaker is delighted that you speak French and and continues the transaction as such, or, in cases such as these, they tend to go mum once they realized you understood their badmouthing lol. Thankfully, the former tends to happen to me more than the latter! "
"Ick. People like that woman really need to pay attention to what they're doing. I get the same damn story about BigDepartmentStore's credit card from customers. It is such a PROCESS to apply for the store credit card that it still confuses me how someone doesn't realize, WHEN THEY'RE ENTERING THEIR SSN, that they're applying for something that JUST MIGHT be a bit of a big deal????"
"Yea, if anyone she knows works for any kind of news organisation they'll take one look at the documentation, see exactly what it's for plastered all over it and the first question they will ask the woman is,  
&gt; Did you not read the documentation you were signing?

At which point all her legs go out and that's that."
