Scam. 
"Depends on location, time, weather, what I'm carrying, how tired I am, and how many transfers I would have to make on the train to get from point a to point b. "
"That sucks -- I'm sorry that happened. As a woman here, I pretty much operate under the assumption I **am** being followed when I walk around at night. It sucks to ""profile"" and be paranoid, but it sucks worse to be a victim. You really can't be too safe.

I don't know what if I would have done, but I would at least start carrying pepper spray. I never walk under scaffolding at night (too many blind corners) and I try to walk in the street. 

I'd try to find a bodega or another open store to pop into to give police time to come. That way there are at least cameras to hopefully scare off the stalkers.

If there are no bodegas around, I'd probably do exactly what you did; call the police and notify anyone around who seemed safe.

I'm sorry that happened to you... I feel safe most of the time here, but it just takes one experience to ruin it. Good luck.

**edit: I am a black woman whose parents grew up in South Central LA; My mom tells me to not be afraid, but to be alert, and I've heard enough stories of my dad getting confronted/chased by gang bangers (for wearing red shoes, for instance) that I look out for colors. I would have been afraid too."
"Sometimes the A, sometimes the D. We can't you just fucking sit on the train like everyone else? Why does there have to be loud music you're playing on your I-Phone, or using the seat next to you like a drum, or practicing your ""dance"" routines that nobody wants to see?? Or eating cheap, hot food that stinks up the whole car? Or carry on a conversation in your indoor voice, if you have one? Why is it so hard to just stare into space and daydream like everyone else? Why do you have to call attention to yourself? Were you ignored as a child? Does the whole world have to pay for that forever?"

"Marriott Marquis, either on the second floor and just find a corner to sit up against a wall or the 8th floor lobby. 8th floor will probably have more comfortable seating options but slightly noisier."
"I was living on 44th and 10th and the girl I was seeing was in the West Village. She straight up said she didn't like walking to the 2 avenues from the ACE so it was over. I really dodged a bullet there, as it were. "

"27/m. Functioning alcoholic, have met most of the active users of this sub, won't try to have sex with you."
"Whatever you pick, make sure that the noise from the headphones can't be heard by people next to you. Having to endure 45 minutes of muffled generic drum beats from the guy across the car is incredibly annoying."
So I stupidly showed this to my wife thinking it was funny and now she won't stop talking about. OP can you please confirm if this is real or not? She's ready to go and help to get the cat out and won't let it go. 
"Yes, although if you were renting, $2000/month would be the most you'd be allowed with $80K salary, and you wouldn't be saving much. If you're willing to put up with the hassle, you could probably rent it out for more than $2000/month, maybe a lot more depending on how nice and where, and save some money per month while still being able to rent a decent place in Manhattan."

LOL."
"I bet it flattened itself out, and went right through a seam in the wall."
I wish it would stop because I wish people weren't in such turmoil that they thought this was the only option.

"NYC doorman here. I would say that you should give what you can afford to give provided that we've done a good job. I truly appreciate all tips. What I don't appreciate is getting $5 from the guy who has a dog in therapy and an endless conga line of strippers and coke dealers going in and out  of his apartment telling me he wishes it could be more but it was a 'tough year'.  Like a lot of other things, we know what you can afford. The 'I'm broke' routine when you're paying more in monthly maintenance than I'm making in a year is an insult. "
"I really wouldn't worry-- if somehow you didn't pay, you got away with it.

Way more likely, you paid and just don't remember.  No cab driver is going to just let you go without paying.  Either you paid cash and totally forgot (you were sick/out of it) or you paid with card and the payment just hasn't been processed yet.  They can take a few days to show up sometimes."
"Here are two articles on your question!

Sorry that I can't offer an original answer myself. It looks like the subreddit's rules allow posting links (or at least don't disallow it)."
I had this happen when I was a kid. We ended up busting the wall open and getting her out. Walls can be patched.
I've been to Duane Reede almost every other day for the last three years and didn't even realize I could win something. 
I shared a 475 square foot apartment with my brother and both of our girlfriends. Does that count?

I suspect you paid and don't remember it. You might have forgotten but the cab driver definitely wouldn't.
"Now this is a girl whom you've dated for three years, and you're asking strangers on the internet to give you an ""amazing as possible"" trip that makes her ""say wow, rain or shine"".  And for some reason, I get the feeling that you'll be taking the credit for this ""amazing"" trip.  I could be wrong, but something is telling me that I'm not...

Did you even take the time to look at the sidebar links, or perhaps try Google?

Okay, so you've also given us the following information: 

&gt; ... __we__ love food, and just doing fun things! __We__'re both under 21, __we__'re currently in college. __We__'re not the most interested in museums ...

To me, that suggests a little about your take on the relationship.  Maybe you're not conscious of it.  That's entirely possible.  I was your age once, and I sure as hell wasn't fully aware of all my emotions even half of the time.

Take this piece of advice from someone who's been in a position that may very likely be yours someday, if not right now: 

__Make the fucking effort or you'll fucking lose her__.  You know her better than we ever could--even if you posted a novel of info, you've been her boyfriend for over a *thousand* days.  That's over a quarter of a million hours.  

You know her pet peeves and the little things she loves; her hopes and dreams and childhood wishes are all somewhere in your head.  Jot some of those down on a blank piece of paper in front of you while you take a measly 30, or even 60 minutes, clicking a button and pressing keys.  Open up Word and pick a template that looks pretty, and type it up.  Maybe even spice it up a little with colours and pictures and print it out.

Wanna go the extra mile?  Fuck yes you do, you've been together three years; for you that's somewhere around __fifteen percent__ of your life spent in this relationship (nearly __one-sixth__ --how much time has passed since you made this thread?)

Remember that piece of paper I told you to use two paragraphs ago?  [Fold it into a fucking crane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSijU52XJ7w).^1  Give it to her, and tell her about how you planned your day with what you wrote down about her.  This shit literally takes ten minutes.  Maybe even tell her about this thread, I don't care.

Anyways, I don't know why I bothered to write up this post.  I don't do this sort of shit very often.  When I do, I usually feel strongly, so I end up doing it.  You can thank me if you want, or you can curse at me.  Whatever.

Edit:

Oh I know now.  It's because I took my sleeping pills and I happened across this thread while reflecting upon my past.  Honestly though dude, if you're not gonna do anything I posted, then go with what /u/Pharmacololgy wrote, whatever the hell that was."

"Yeah, sounds like the classic broken bottles/broken glasses scam. They bump into you, say you broke their glasses/vodka/medicine, cajole you into paying $10 - $50 to get out of your face. "
"Forget the delays, the impact on the train operator who has to live with the fact that they killed someone with their train is just awful."
