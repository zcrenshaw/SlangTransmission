"Pretty sure that requires hands there, bud."
Do I need to learn the Greek alphabet to know that it exists and is real?

"&gt;I, for one, find it interesting how MRAs are so quick to shout ""not all men"" when feminists complain about rape/domestic violence, but they have no problem judging feminism as a whole by the actions of a few.

One thing you are born as, the other you identify as. I have no problem judging you for what you identify with. "
"You're trying to apply logic to religion

Don't do that"

"I'm asserting something about the nature of the two subjects. If you can't understand that, I don't even know why you are participating in the discussion. "
"I've read the bible. I used to be Christian.

The bible nowhere states that evolution occurred or that there was a Big Bang. So I wonder who knows nothing about Christianity, really."
Shouldn't you only make fun of things people can't change? How else are they able to be normal if they don't make light of their abnormality?

"For those of us who aren't autistic, these kinds of jokes are how people who don't give a shit about eachother exchange pleasant banter."
"Back when I was a manager at McDonalds we hired this 16 year old girl.
On her first shift we asked her to change the bags in the garbage can.
She replied ""I don't do garbage.""
She didn't come back for a second shift."
Do you really want bars full of drunk 18 year olds?
"I'm just as irritated to wake up in the wee hours of the night to a text as I am a call, what's the difference? Either way, my phone is making a noise that wakes me up.

Which is why I take a bit of personal responsibility and silence my phone if I don't want to be disturbed. "
Spit is not a lubricant.
"There has to be some kind of psychological issues going on here. Somewhere you have to draw a line, and this is far beyond it."

"I don't understand this mentality at all. People say that he has no experience and would make an incompetent politician. So what do you want? A career politician from the Clinton or Bush dynasties? Ronald Reagan was an actor and the country didn't go down in flames when he was president. In fact, during his presidency the Cold War ended, taxes were cut, and America prospered.


So when people tell me that Ben Carson would've made a terrible president, I sit here looking at Trump and Clinton and think, ""Is that so?""

Most jobs actually take some sort of skill though
"18 and 14 isnt really that bad at all. Hell, thats legal in a lot of the world."

"You really can't believe that the original smash bros has held up that well, can you? I still play it occasionally too but there's no way I think it's better than the wii u one. It's very slow paced, visuals are garbage, no charge attacks, the controller isn't great, grabs are waaay too easy, and there aren't many characters to choose from. That isn't to say it wasn't amazing when it came out, it just hasn't held up well. My only problems with the newest one are that you can't edge guard by holding an edge anymore and there actually might be a few too many characters. "
"Downvoted for the /s tag, as always. Why do some Redditors feel the need to ruin their comments with that stupid shitty tag? Either you did sarcasm correctly, so the /s tag isn't needed as the sarcasm is obvious, or you just made a lazy shitty comment and lazily slapped the /s tag on it. Quit with that stupid fucking tag.

"
"I am sure they were also put on a list and will impact them till the day they die. I just hate that in American society we value punishment over rehabilitation. Also if it makes you feel better, the person was probably killed in jail."
I still don't see your point.
Popular souvenir? A token of gratitude for having not been born American.  
Did you help him or sat there like a sitting duck? Expecting someone else to?
Are you kidding me? That place has been brutal to Hillary.
Who the fuck are you. God's homie? Where's your evidence about what happens after death? Have you died before? Or are you just but hurt because you can't accept that we don't know what happens after death?
"Is there evidence it is caused by humans though? 

Buzz Aldrin says he's skeptical of the supposed human role in global warming: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2814701/I-sceptical-humans-causing-global-warming-says-Buzz-Aldrin-thinks-people-sent-DIE-Mars.html. 

I think a doctor in aerospace engineering, West Point and MIT grad, Air Force Colonel and NASA astronaut may be slightly smarter than the average person. 

Before you say it's just one man saying that, [here is a letter from 49 NASA scientists and astronauts](http://www.livescience.com/19643-nasa-astronauts-letter-global-warming.html) that is stating their skepticism of humanity's role in global warming. "
"Please don't generalize half the population of the world into one group. They might be worse on average, but that does not mean that they are all bad or anything like that."

"Rule #1 about these Brit threads: Never, ever criticise the Brits.

He beat his wife a lot. He seems to be good to everyone that isn't in his personal life. 
"Here's an idea: wanting to protect your country's borders isn't racist, and he doesn't have to apologize. Hell, that's why he has succeeded. Meanwhile he actually donated seventy thousand pounds of food and water to flood victims while Obama was out at Martha's Vineyard playing golf. Obama doesn't give a damn about anyone. He's an asshole.

But no, he said something offensive."
I really don't understand stories like this or why they get up voted.
