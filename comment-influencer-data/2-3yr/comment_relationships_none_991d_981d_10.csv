"I wouldn't worry about it. 

Because he is 30, you are 21, so you aren't part of his long-term plans anyway.  

Sorry to be harsh."
"Ya! Don't let it ruin your holidays. Poo poo on her and the cliquey job, I say.

Take the holiday break as a chance to spruce up your resume and go knock 'em dead, tiger. Your coworkers sound like trash."
"Seriously, I've come across those subreddits from time to time because of people linking them. 
Here's one of the comments.

&gt;I've never been jealous of the wife. Just envious of the time she gets and the fact that she gets ""more"" of everything.I do get jealous of other women though. I've been through hell in that regard. I guess I don't perceive the wife as a threat because she's been there all along and yet he wants to be with me. A new woman is much more of a threat.

Just wow. I can't believe that people are like that, but hey, there are billions so I'm not surprised. Just shows you the other side."
"So after one over-protective lecture (which was out of line but understandable if you lived with them) he has spent years actively disrespecting your parents, insulting them, belittling your mother as a woman, and playing passive Aggressive games like not eating their food?

Your boyfriend is an immature idiot."
"Advice No.1: Remove yourself from the situation and help the younger family members in any way you can while keeping yourself safe. You do not need to subject yourself to this.

Alternative Advice: If you are stuck for whatever reason, get a taser and the next time he tries something, tase his fucking balls and drop him to the floor."

"Yes. 
Like I said in my OP I normally am all about ""surprise"" and ""thoughtful"" gifts. So yes, it was the first time given a wishlist. "
"I still have the nagging feeling that there is a massive misunderstanding here, unless your husband is truly a massive, unapologetic douchebag. You keep saying things like ""I think I assumed . . . "" ""I think his train of thought is . . ."" etc. 

He told you point blank when you had the conversation about why you were working overtime that you ""couldn't have spent that much"", so I doubt he understood that you literally bought everything on the list. The only alternative would be that he has no idea how much those items cost or how much you make, which seems unlikely. (If he doesn't know how much you make, that's an even bigger problem that needs to be addressed). 

When you talked to him about it just now, what exactly did you say that prompted the ""Well I got everything off your list!"" response? Did you just ask him whether he got everything you asked for? Or did you explicitly tell him that you just spent over $1,000 on all of his gifts?

"
"For God's sake, don't have any more kids with this guy till he shows a massive improvement."
"You just paid $20 to find out he isn't a friend. Money well spent. 

"
Visit a divorce attorney. Set up counseling for yourself and for your family to get through this terrible situation. 
"Yes, this, oh my god. I'm extra creeped out by submissive as a compliment because I'm Asian and I get so many guys who talk about getting submissive Asian girlfriends and wives. 

The way he said it sounded like ""make sure you guys don't settle for anybody that isn't submissive or beautiful! Ugly girls with opinions are no-gos!"" "
If he asks then tell the truth.  Don't hide the information.  
"Until you're able to free yourself from living with them, you're stuck with it. There are no magic words that are going to make your parents change their behaviour. "
"YES. Go over there, get your key from the boyfriend and your guitar from Peter, and leave."
"Yup, if your boyfriend gets key privileges he is by association responsible for whatever his ""friend"" did while he was graciously allowed into your home (to borrow one of your more expensive belongings, no less!). Your boyfriend AND his friend need to apologize and rectify the situation! 

Edit: word"
"Honestly, I would try to give her some grace in this situation. It's definitely understandable that you feel snubbed. But it sounds like she may be dealing with some real phobias and/or mental health issues and may feel very ashamed and self-loathing about her behavior, yet at the same time have a hard time controlling it. Try to reset and start tomorrow fresh. "
Call when he leaves to report an impaired driver. Give them the plate info. If he owns his car they will come looking.
"1. Not her problem.
2. not her problem.
3. not her problem.
 None of that means shit. You do not yell at your mentally ill daughter *for her own rape*."
Thank you. I'll talk to them about therapy and I'll seek my counselor after break ends. 
"&gt;I would talk to him and give an ultimatum: give me a more in depth answer or we won't have a relationship any more.  

Agreed. Maybe, maybe, maybe there's a valid reason for sabotaging OP's job search. If so, the father needs to share it. 

At the same time, the father should have shared his reason with OP, rather than taking matters into his own hands. "
"Then shut the fuck up and take the 'insults' in stride and talk shit to them back? It is called family banter? I don't give a single shit that you work 60 hours a week. I had co-workers that did 80 hours of overtime a week on top of their regular 40 hours a week. Not once did they complain about it. Stop with the pity party and apologize to your parents for being a disrespectful little shit and ruining their christmas. They already apologized and said they didn't realize their 'insults' hurt you. How do you expect them to know that if you didn't tell them anything about your life? Dipshit, use your brain before you hurt your family like that, especially when they did take care of you by letting you play video games and paying your whole tuition."
Oh please yourself mate. OP do not underestimate them. This isn't a risk that OP should take. Be smarter.

"A key point from that post is:

&gt;By only going on more dates with men where you feel an immediate spark, you might be efficiently eliminating the ones that are interested in more than just sex.

The underlying reason is that sparks don't magically ""just happen"". Someone needs to put in active effort to create this situation where not only are you having fun, feeling excited and feeling secure/comfortable, but also all those things seem to be the result of you and him matching perfectly together. The ""we are so compatible that we magically have a great time"" actually is a show that takes effort to project.

Many girls think that sparks either happen spontaneously, or not. And they take that as evidence that they are compatible with the guy, or not.

So those girls don't put in the effort needed to create the spark. Among the guys, there are two groups: those that know how this works, and those that also just buy into the myth of ""you either have the spark or you don't"". The latter group, you likely meet at dates which seem lame and boring and sparkless because nobody is really pulling the cart. The former group has specialized in how to excite girls, so they succeed in making you feel the spark. But why and how do you think they went through all that effort, to perfect their technique at making girls feel the spark? Exactly.

If you filter for guys who make you feel the spark magically, then you find that group specifically."
"I really think we should stop downvoting OPs that we don't necessarily agree with, they're here seeking help not to be attacked. "
"Things I say to other adults who are my equal ""Wow dad""
Long silence
""Well you made this very awkward dad""
""You are using your outside head voice"" 
""What"" (the trick in this one is to try and get them to repeat it as many times either they realize how awful they sound or they give up)
Obviously you need to be more careful with your dad because of the power difference but stand up for your brother. Make sure to tell your bro that you dissagree with dad. Invite him to hang out only the two (or only the none homophobes). Tell him you understand if he won't want to come visit next Christmas "
"Yes, go. Go now and don't look back. He's emotionally abusive and he won't ever change. Save yourself. Go now.  Right now, get up and go."
"Even if he were attending Christmas, telling people to not forget gifts is rude and shitty. That's the same as putting it on a wedding invitation"
"We've had people at my op shop(charity store) from online shoplifting groups trying to get some of our good shit with the pricetags still on so they can pretend they stole it from that store. They think we'll go easy on them. 

We don't. "
"Someone's panties are in a bunch lol 
I think you're funny "
"cant get a fulltime job... I have school. I've already talked to her, she said that there's no changing her mind. I wouldn't be asking strangers for help otherwise."
"Yeah. She's probably super confused and really really out of place. As far as she's concerned, she has woken up and she's supposed to be heading into highschool lessons- with her friends who don't know her any more, with coursework that has long been lost, wearing clothes that are long gone. She doesn't recognise the fact that greets her in the mirror - she needs therapy for this before she can possibly make any progress in her relationship with OP and their children."
"I don't mean to be rude but that's not exactly a taxing schedule. It's quite average. You wake up, have a normal shift, get home pretty early, have time to eat, nap, and go to the gym, but then you still need the rest of the night to unwind and are too exhausted for sex?

I'm not doubting your experience but I am saying that it's unusual that you are so tired even after having an afternoon nap that you can only have lazy sex. Have you talked to a doctor about how fatigued you are? How much sleep are you getting? You're in your early twenties and these are normal daily activities, they shouldn't be causing this level of exhaustion. Do you have any health issues?

I would be frustrated if my bf's libido disappeared one day and he wasn't doing anything to fix it. Taking active steps to solve this problem with her will go a long way to easing the tension about your mismatched libidos."
"DUDE!!!

Where are you getting all of this? 

He's not even sure she's upset about anything. 

Is everyone just filling in the blanks here?"
You're 19 and hiring escorts? THAT'S what's not a healthy thing as far as people getting into relationships. You might as well since you're probably going to have to end up trying to date hookers when you try to talk about your sexual history with non-sex workers. 
"This. ""No, Betty. "" ""i understand...bu--"" ""No."" ""yes but--"" ""No. nooooo. No."""
Accurate. 
"OP was chatting in the apartment in the middle of the night; this probably comes down to a few beers, a lot of laughter (which is always loud, even if you try to be quiet), and some accidental noises that you can't predict will happen. Amsterdam houses are old and not very soundproof, and it is very frowned upon to be up and about in the middle of the night when you have upstairs or downstairs neighbours. 

To be honest if you want to have fun in the middle of the night chatting just go to a café, it's Amsterdam, it doesn't matter where you are one will be open nearby."
"You don't miss your wife, you miss the life you thought you had with your wife."
"Have you had an open and honest conversation with her about how you've changed? (Not hinting, not arguing). 

Because I think it's reasonable to want more input into how your children are raised, but I'm not sure you're letting her know what you actually want. "
"Were you ""exclusive"" in October? Was it clear to both of you that you were in a committed relationship? If so, than her conversation with that guy (I'mma call him Bob, since you didn't give him a name) was inappropriate. She should have shut Bob down and drawn a clearer boundary.

**But** you really, really shouldn't have snooped. It's a huge betrayal of trust and saying ""I couldn't figure out how to log out of messenger"" is the lamest excuse ever. You know what you do when you can't log out? You close the app and check later. From what you said you didn't have any reason to doubt her, and you decided that it was OK to invade her privacy for the benefit of your curiosity. Worse, you didn't just glance over one message, you dug through multiple conversations. I hope you realize how much of a violation that is; that you found questionable information doesn't justify your actions. "
"Thanks for both the insight into how to slowly bring him back to the light side and the harsh truth at the end, lol.

I really do love him and want nothing more than to make him happy and make this work... but if I'm the only one working then, yeah, I just need to find someone who won't take me for granted."
[removed]
"This didn't really answer the question, which makes me think that he doesn't see it as a problem/something that needs to be fixed..."
"Unfortunately, loosing his daughter might be the wake up call he needs to save himself. Right now, by putting up with this horrendous abuse (you AND your dad are being abused) you are enabling him to stay with her. It's ""not so bad"" in your Dad's head as long as he can keep the status quo. Break that status quo. Not an ultimatium of her or me but more of a ""I don't set myself on fire to keep anyone warm, especially adults who are SUPPOSED to be protecting me."" This woman is unstable and has no problem putting your life in danger. She probably doesn't have a problem taking your life either. DO NOT GO NEAR HER AGAIN.

Save yourself. Hope your dad will save himself. That's all you really can do."
"Because you aren't also reading the OP's specific situation.  He's about to lose a close friendship because of his stance on exes.   Is not wanting to hang out with an ex worth costing a friendship he describes as ""extremely close"" and valuable to him?   

A stance on ""exes"" needs to be based on reality and situation and not a blanket ban.  Just like any other category of people.  Not every situation is the same.   Having a blanket policy against any category of people that you refuse to change depending on circumstances IS immature.  I DON'T WANT TO BE FRIENDS! Why? BECAUSE! BECAUSE! BECAUSE!   

Yeah.  That's way immature. "
"It's only a business deal if you're charging him interest. If not, it's just a debt he's not paid yet."
"These are some very good suggestions, especially since OP appears to have some time to herself once the older kids are at school.

OP, there is no guarantee that you'll enjoy working in retail more than your current job, and you may even find it more tiring and spend less time with your family if you have to work 2-3 jobs.

I think the more mature and responsible option here is to suck it up and keep working as a nanny to pay your bills and student loans, and pick up side jobs once you've gained enough skills to do so."
"If you're prepared to dump your current partner because you met a stranger who happens to share your taste in music, you should probably just break up anyway, but for different reasons. "
"I'm so sorry your sister treated you like this, she was really insensitive. It doesn't take that long to text or call anyone, there's no excuse. 

"
Half a year isn't actually that long. At all. You'll find someone again in the right time.
"OK, taking this 100% seriously: it's harmless.  Everyone eats their own nasal mucus by the pint every day.  It flows down the throat and into the esophagus by design -- this is part of your immune system, to move foreign particles captured in the mucus during breathing into your stomach (where foreign stuff goes to be broken down) and not your lungs (where it would enter the bloodstream).

Obviously it bothers you for social reasons, as it does for most of us.  So:

1. Stop making such a big deal about this.  It's a nervous habit like biting fingernails.

2.  Just start calling him out on it when you see it, and express how seriously this concerns you.

Then be patient.  Most people never really kick habits like this (I still bite my nails occasionally and I'm in my 40's).  Hopefully he'll learn to hide it better."
"I have pauses in my speech because my thoughts and my words aren't at the same speed. I also have to take pauses or I start to slur and lisp due to a speech impediment. Something that I have noticed is that I use my hands when talking, either as gestures or just waving them about. When I am paused to 'reset' my tongue for speaking or to gather my thoughts, my hands will normally still be raised. It is a pretty good indicator to others that my story isn't done and I just need a moment."
"True, but some other guy acting exactly like you do *could* be dangerous, potentially very dangerous. Being unpredictable means exactly that, I can't predict whether you'll be dangerous or not. And I'm not risking my life or limb (or advising others to do the same) to find out just because you don't like the idea that acting unpredictably makes people uncomfortable."
To be honest they probably don't think you're going to give it up any time soon.
"I don't think it makes sense to triple your monthly expenses. However you should try to take seriously your girlfriend's concerns about her safety. What is it she is worried will happen? Does your area have a history of crime or just look run down? Just because you haven't had problems doesn't mean she won't. Talk with her about how she feels and figure out what you can do to make her feel safer. 

Additionally I don't see why there can't be some compromise? Is their not a moderately nicer area that you can look into instead of just the options of stay or triple your rent? "
"Dang, I'm sorry that you've had to go through this. Good luck with your business and keep respecting your boundaries and wishes."
The fact that they moved you away from the rest of your family is really shitty and isolating too. 
You don't seem to get the message. I'd probably block you as well. 
"Stop taking it personally. Go ask your manager how to proceed with the project considering your peer is missing deadlines.

Leave out any detail or speculation about his personal life--it's not relevant to how to proceed with the project."
Sounds like a seperate post
How was that the wrong answer?  What's wrong with regularly telling her how attractive she is?  What would the right answer have been?
"No, it is not really possible to have a relationship with either a conman or pathological liar, at least not one that is healthy. You are, however, under no obligation to warn others about this man's lies simply because you were a victim of them. It is noble of you to be willing to try, but you have to understand that con-men and pathological liars can only succeed if they have charisma or some other trait that makes them easy to trust. It worked on you, not because you're stupid or naive, but because that is what they do: appear to be something they're not, and get people to love their persona.

 Think about it. Who would the people decide to believe? Their ""friend"" who claims you are something you are not, and likely has elaborate backstory to ""prove"" it, or you, who they have absolutely no connection to? It's a good ideal, but in practical terms an uphill battle."
"Sometimes unfortunately, it takes just that one thing to push us over the edge. The blinders suddenly come off, and we are able to see much more than before. 

I hope this also allows you to see how mean he is to you and how you don't deserve that. *When* you find someone more mature, loving, and respectful, you will wonder how you wasted so much time on this loser. You will also find that you won't have to stress out and put yourself in bad situations anymore either."
"Oh jeez I'm sorry. That has to be extremely frustrating, trying to do the right thing to no avail. As bad as your uncles drinking is I think the bigger safety issue is your dad's reaction. He sounded very aggressive and I got the impression he was going to hit your sister. I certainly hope that wasn't the case but even without the physical violence he sounds very unhealthy to be around. Your brother won't always be there to protect you or your sister. Has your dad gotten physical before?"
"This is the problem with dating someone older than you.  You two are at different life stages.  You are still in your early 20s, working on building a foundation whereas your girlfriend is in her mid 30s. 

Her timeline includes marriage and probably babies too if I'm guessing right.  It's probably worrying her because she's at the age where pregnancy begins to become riskier and riskier with age.  She's entitled to her timeline and so are you, but they are incompatible at the moment.  Again, you are both in different life stages.  Make your timeline very clear."
I LOVE this answer! They couldn't handle being REAL engineers! It's over their heads :p
"&gt; my boyfriend and I tell each other our dreams often enough and especially when we have a bad one, we will tell each other for comfort.

&gt; I'm annoyed because I feel he should have kept it to himself

You each have different boundaries but you absolutely can't be upset at him for this. Tell him that you'd rather not hear about dreams like this in the future and drop it."
Sounds like the fiancée condones him committing insurance fraud but mad that she didn't get much benefit from it. 
"It likely is, and your daughter recognized that and is trying to help push you along in your recovery. It's good you have a daughter that cares about her father's wellbeing. 

Good luck, OP. &lt;3"
"I would just turn to them, a little embarassed and say ""I'm sorry I didn't bring this up the other day, but I dont' wear jewelry because I have a pretty bad metal allergy. I just felt sort of akward bringing it up yesterday."""
"People croudsource unbiased opinions in this sub all the time. I read this as ""not sure if this is an issue I should get over, or just call it quits because this is incompatible."" OP has been cool and undefensive throughout this whole thread and seems to be answering questions honestly. Get off her back. "
"I just want to clarify-- I'm not forcing Nate to do anything. If he feels that no contact is the best for him, I will fully support him and also cut contact with his parents. He's mentioned how it may be a good solution. but neither of us are sure at the moment what the best option would be, especially because we're a young couple and without his family we really don't have any support systems. I'm probably going to have a conversation with Nate about this again, but for now we just don't know."
"Well, seeing as how she's logged into her own account right now, probably by checking her messages and seeing the replies. "
"Also, if the newspaper has games in it in Dutch, you could practice doing crosswords/word games/etc. to learn the language in a more fun way. You'll probably have to look up a lot of stuff in the beginning and translate it or google it for the pop culture references, but it might be a fun way to play around with the language instead of just looking at verb charts :) "
"I'd tell him. You've not done anything wrong, but if it's a deal breaker for him, then it's a deal breaker. (You'd want him to respect your deal breakers too, right?) Plus, there are so many stories here where a person does not think it matters, then their partner finds out years later, and it's a giant mess."
"Okay, that makes sense. I actually do keep my money in a gap between my mattress and bed board, and there's no way to mess with it without me knowing. And I'm actually taking Personal Finance as a class so I'm learning about bank accounts and stuff now!  "
The fastest way to get a girlfriend is to realize women are people and not some output from the girlfriend factory
"If he's genuinely not sure, it might be worth talking to a doctor about.  There are any number of biological and psychological issues that could be going on. "
"Definitely dump him, but if you're noticing a trend here maybe the issue is that your initial attraction is superficial. If all the guys you've dated are boring, unmotivated, stoners without hobbies, maybe you should try to meet someone you at a more interesting location- go to museums, libraries, etc rather than bars."
You're only 25. There will be better boyfriends.
"No. You should simply GTFO and not make things any worse.  

"
"Dont let her talk. She never gave anyone the opportunity to talk to him as she banned him from talking to all of you. She has no right to ""speak on his behalf""."
"I have been with my bf for 4 years,  and I could never say about our fights that ""he's said a lot of mean things."" He's a good guy who doesn't tear me down even in frustration. 

Don't keep dating someone who shows you an unkind aspect of their personality repeatedly until it finally climaxes to the worst thing they've done so far. "
"OP you did the right thing, but this comment right here is a classic reddit response. Cut and run, then convince everyone else who matters to do the same. Stupid advice that everyone jumps straight to on this subreddit based on some previous bad experience they've had in their lives. Every situation is different, don't presume that one night of stupidity is enough to simply erase these people from your life.

Both your mam and her boyfriend have acted stupidly, probably because they were drunk. Try and sit down and calmly explain your position today. If it was a choice between someone who had been drinking vs someone who hadn't, then it's a no brainer who should be driving. Plus they were your sisters and you felt their safety was at risk, you're entitled to look after family! 

You had the right and should have brought them home, if they don't like that, tough shit. There's no reason to cut them out of your life and get your mam to break up with her boyfriend. In my opinion, that is not your place."
"But do people buy it? I can't believe people buy it. Don't they actually know after all? 

Does OP divorce the gf if she gains weight later in the marriage? "
" While generally I'd say it's a good thing to donate blood if you want since hospitals are always in need of it... I find it so disturbing that your dad's gf is pressuring and hounding you like this! I don't even know if it's legal to donate blood at your age, especially since your body is still growing, so taking a ""normal"" unit of blood may affect you negatively.

Once you're 18, if YOU want, you can choose to donate blood through the Red Cross or local blood banks, and it's not too terrible of a procedure - they just put a rather big needle in your arm that's connected to a bag where they collect blood. Everyone is usually nice, and they give you snacks and juice to help replenish your hydration and sugar levels.

But again, this is an extremely weird thing to try to push a 13 year old to do! Have you told you dad about it?? If I were him, I would be highly concerned!"
"I feel like if my partner did this, I would then be paranoid every time we had a fight, he was texting girls to try and fuck them. 

You are only six months in and he's already got one foot out the door. "
"So, you disinvited him from that trip just because he wanted to spend Christmas with family and wouldn't dump all of them in favor of you. Then the only reason you regret is because, your friend is just as much of a shithead as you. 



You are a horrible person and he should dump you. Best thing you can do is break up and take long look in the mirror. "
"i think mark and linda are crazy assholes

however, some of the other stuff in your post kinda made me do a corgi head-tilt

like, how young were you when you got married that you've been married ""a couple years"" at 21?  like 16?

what exactly does it mean that Nate has trouble regulating his emotions, because like half the time that seems like code for ""punches holes in walls""

also, you mention that Nate is on the spectrum, and it seems like his family is treating him as way lower functioning than he is.  was he like special ed or something growing up and his parents don't know how to treat him like a functioning person now?

also, i creeped on your post history and again, i think that mark and linda are crazy racist assholes who have no right to criticize you given that they're fucking crazy, but completely objectively, i would not be thrilled if my unemployed daughter in law described her education/ career plans as:

&gt;I'm a self-taught ""chef for dog food/treats,"" or at least I'm studying to be one. My dream is to have a taco truck that makes food for both humans and dogs. 

unless you have like a super-solid business plan with cost projections and shit

you also mention you can't work because of visa issues and that makes me raise an eyebrow too

i think mark and linda are awful, but there seems like something is off about quite a few elements in this story"
You don't need great fertility to have kids. You're not a bull. You can have unprotected sex for years and have a lot of chances of pregnancy. 10% isn't so bad. 
At most!? Ahahhahhahahhahahhahhahahhhahahhahahhahahhahahha.  Sorry.  Even mys sister's cheapo midwestern childcare costs like 800 a month.  
"I think you're missing the point. This issue can be resolved because they can have kids, either from adooption or 3rd parties. You're just assuming that non-conventional means of becoming a parent won't work for either op or his wife because you're just reflecting your own personal opinion of it rather than understanding that op, his wife and many other couples (and single parents)  who have donors, surrogates or opt for adoption can be perfectly happy doing so. "
"Tell her politely, no reason to argue or defend your decision, but tell her soon. The more time you give her to make her own arrangements, the better it is."
"I think it would be best to side with your fiance on this issue, because clearly you're in it for the long haul with him. 

As for dealing with Tim, remember that you and your fiance are going to be a team now, and you need to be able to stand by his decisions. Plus, you don't consider your friendship as close anymore - you can acknowledge the bond you two had before, and still accept that the friendship has run its course. So if you think you should end the friendship, you should. Don't try to soften the blow by saying ""if it helps, I don't agree with my husband."" Just present it as a joint decision""My husband and I talked about it and we (key word: we) decided not to invite you to our wedding."" Basically, don't throw your fiance under the bus here. You don't need to provide a reason, but don't frame the lack of an invitation as an insult either. I wouldn't be surprised if that upset him, but your priority is your fiance and you need to respect his feelings on Tim."
"He made a post a week or so ago saying that he and his wife just had their first child, which is nearly four months and the baby doesn't sleep. 

Yeah, I'd say that's stress."
Dude you posted in the wrong sub probably. Try r/deadbeadrooms.
"Yup. My husband is a programmer. 

He works his day job and works on a game with friends in his spare time. He needs those other people. One's an artist, the other has a really great game engine going. My husband is the physics and graphics guy. Even then, this will take a long time. "
"Fair, but prohibitively so? Are they going to go their entire relationship only visiting one family? Can they make a deal to spend every third year with her family during the holiday or something? If not, I would think this would build a serious resentment. It would for me, anyway. "
"What on earth are you doing?!  You got with another girl while in a trial separation, then you decided to try again with your wife and ""ended things"", for ONE WEEK?  Now you're with the GF for 4 days and you are wondering about your wife?

You need to get your head out of your ass.  You treated your wife terribly.  Adjusting to marriage is hard and takes time....a lot longer 4 months.  You didn't even give it any effort!  IT's not her job to make you happy.  You should have tried counseling first, not separated.

You need to BREAK UP with the GF and get into individual counselling.  You need to sort out why you're so flaky and non-committal.  You don't love this new girl, you barely know her.  Work on yourself or you're never going to be a good husband or boyfriend."
"Ooh man, o boy. Yes, he is over the age of consent. Yes, it's legal for him to be dating. But you need to consider the fact that not only is there a huge gap in age, but in maturity as well. OP is a fresh 18 year old, dating someone who is significantly older then he is. 

That creates a huge power rift between them, as the man he is dating has a much greater understanding of how people work, the world works, ect. Maybe OPs boyfriend is a completely nice dude, and doesn't have any ill intentions for him; but that does not get rid of the fact that there is still a pretty big age gap between the two that could potentially be dangerous for OP.  Just because someone is over the age of consent doesn't mean that age is not an issue."
"I'm introverted and I will listen with fascination and interest to anything anyone wants to tell me about themselves without being moved in any way to inquire... unless we're already in a conversation about them, and an obvious question presents itself.  It's partly a lack of social practice - if you don't spend a lot of time around other people, it might not occur to you that any of the burden of discovery/instigating a personal conversation falls on you, and this extends even to people who *do* interest you, like your SO.  Or, it's possible that he's not interested in the exchange of constant information, that he finds communication on that level uninteresting full stop.

Asking questions and getting someone to open up about themselves is an extrovert's talent.  An introvert's is listening.  It's possible he does want to know all about you - it's also possible he's content just to be with you and really doesn't care about the minutiae of your life - so if you're someone who requires a lot of input to feel socially satisfied, he may not be the guy for you, long-term."
"This sounds a lot like my abusive father. He is already isolating her from friends and destroying her confidence. His behaviour will only worsen with time. My father started beating my mother as soon as she was pregnant and thus ""his"". I have early childhood memories of my father holding letters addressed to my mother to lamps to read them. 

OP, please get out as soon as possible. Maybe break up with him in a public place and don't be alone with him when you collect your things. "
"I agree with the above comment entirely, but have an idea that I would like to add if her parents live nearby: I think that it would be helpful to her to have at least a couple of weeks in which she could stay with her parents instead of having to be in a foreign home with foreign people. I feel that it would be scary to be in an unfamiliar house with people that you don't know rather than back at your parents house to try to reconnect. From there, I think that it would still be nice if once a week or so the whole family, including her, went out to see a movie or go bowling or something. I just think that it would make the transition easier for her and for everyone and it would allow her to feel like she is going out for a nice time with some people to get to know them/spend time with them to become comfortable rather than having no escape from the situation. It might be a getaway that would benefit her. I think so, anyways! Also, is she able to do work outside of the home? Maybe as a waitress or something? It is important for her to have her own interests and activities outside of the ""family life"" which is new to her. Working, rock climbing, crafts, etc. "
"Its generally considered polite not to engage in sexual acts with someone a friend has confided about fancying to you. 

If you also have a crush on that person then you have a conversation with your friend like an adult about whose feelings would get hurt depending on how you proceed."
She wasn't fishing to play the victim; she was fishing for compliments. He was supposed to protest and tell her how thin and beautiful she is. 
"Just an FYI many in professions you can't wear rings - my gf is a nurse and would most likely have it on a necklace at work or just leave it at home. For myself, I can't have an electrically conductive ring where I work so I'm very limited and will most likely just get a tattoo. I feel for you especially since you already had an incident in the workplace with a ring =("

"Eek. I'd run if I were her. You don't back someone into a corner screaming ""love me! love me!"" in their face over and over to get them to love you. This is just....creepier than creep. "
You say it's low. How much is the rent? How much is rent for a home of similar size in your neighborhood?
"""sometimes it's worth waiting for love""  *as she flies back to fuck her boyfriend in another country* lmao the gall of her. dude you gotta distance yourself, yall are not gonna be a thing together. She also emotionally cheated on her bf with you. You gotta let her go. "
"Holy drama queen. He invited you like, three times. What do you expect, him to get on his knees and beg you to go?"
"This is very strange. You made it clear that he was getting a gift from you, and gave him a whole range of sensible suggestions for things that you would like. You also picked several things that cost a small amount of money. You really did everything you could have done. You were clear and straightforward, and you asked for nothing more than you already gave to him.

If this was your first Christmas together, I'd say he was self-absorbed. But because you are married with children, you've obviously got a good Christmas routine sorted.

I don't think there is anything much we can do here except validate that it is indeed *very* odd behaviour. You need to sit him down and have a serious discussion. Something's not right."
"I'm a guy, he should be acting better, you shouldn't alter your behavior one little bit.  Well you need to stand up for your self.

He's rude and completely disrespecting you, this is the start of an abusive relationship.  He trying to lower your self respect.  Next time he's checking  out someone else call him out and tell him,  "" I saw you checking her out, if you are unhappy with me we can end this right now and I'll go and try to get her number for you.  What you did was rude and disrespectful, do it again and we're done.""

Your SO should treat you better than anyone else would treat you, they get no slack, ever.  Doesn't matter if they have issues,  if they can't treat you right then they aren't right for you."
This was fun. A+ all around. 
"Residency is really really hard and difficult time for many doctors. My husband is about to finish his up, and he loves medicine, but he still had his share of struggles.

Unlike other people suggested quitting is really not an option unless she decides to quit medicine forever, and taking time off can be challenging or very frowned upon depending on the program. My husband's co workers had twins, neither parent (both residents) was able to take any time off besides ""regular 2 week vacation"" without losing their spots. Basically, the program told them they wouldn't be able to resume back their residency, and would have to start over somewhere else. They are in internal medicine program, which is more relaxed than other programs. 

Could she go see a professional to talk to? What would be her perfect job? Before she quits she should figure out what she wants to do, if she's just completely burnt out she's not going to get better by jumping into another field. 

Since I assume you work less hours than her could you try to pick up more things to do at home so she has more time to relax, sleep and take care of herself. "
"I can guarantee every comment in this thread will say ""move out, no excuses"""
"You're immature because

A) you could have gotten your own hat back. Instead you tried to make a fourteen year old girl do it then cried when it didn't get done. You knew she wouldn't do it so you should have gotten the hat yourself. 

B) you're being passive aggressive about a hat. She's 14 and immature. You know she isn't going to buy you a hat. Instead of accepting that you lost your own dumb hat. 

C) she kicked it off a bridge but you shouldn't have had it. If anything you should have gotten the hat, laughed about it, and enjoyed you lovely vacation in Costa Rica. You're blessed to be able to have clothing and trips. Learn perspective. "
"I think she'll understand if you say you were thinking of her. And I'm sure she's aware of the stigma that is out there. 
I think it'll be fine.

I can understand your concern, it's great you haven't jumped in so many do that and I think it's really inconsiderate for the child. "
"If they think it's so underhanded and cruel, then I'm sure they'd have no problem handling the hassle of taking the matter to small claims court for you, or chipping in to come up with the grand this jackass owes you. 

Look, he's taken advantage of you and this is your money you're out as a result. Given all the other steps you've taken, all the chances he's blown off, and the fact that he lied to his mom about paying while you were around, I think what you did was completely appropriate and reasonable. "
You both sound extremely unpleasant.

What if your kids decide to not have kids?
"I completely agree with you. I had natural childbirth for my second child, and I nearly died. I hemorrhaged after giving birth and had to have a lot of medical interventions for myself. 

Birth is a completely natural biological process, but in the old days, a lot of women died. I nearly died myself.  (The baby was perfect, though! Perfect apgars, a big, healthy baby)."
"Are you in professional therapy?  Because from this side you're presenting it as if it was obvious there was romance, but to be honest I don't know that there was.  It sounds like you caught her off guard and she doesn't want to be in contact anymore. "
"Yeah i keep suggesting this to my parents, for them to meet them or something but they really aren't having it right now.  Maybe they'll change their mind . 

Like the kids seem nice to me. I've only met them a couple times but they are involved in clubs at school  and they all want to go to college and they seem respectful so I don't see the big deal. My sister met them through some charity club at her school that they are also in at their school. I would get their objection if they seemed like bad kids but they really don't. "
"How she accessed your iPad seems irrelevant. Great, you spend a pile on a lawyer who tells you she likely broke a law to accomplish what exactly?? 

She could argue you gave her the password, whatever, and frankly even without your iPad she could have found out what the pills are by using Google. The bigger deal you make out of your little legal stand, the bigger deal the steroids will become in the eyes of your friends and family. 

I'm certainly hopeful your steroids are of the legal, prescription variety because if they're not this post is even sillier. Now, get over your need for court administered vengeance and talk to your mother about the science behind your prescription (I'm assuming this is well thought out drug use, yes??) and if she tells your friends and family rationally discuss it with them as well."
"He goes on to tell me that I should be happy that he wants to touch me all the time and to take it as a compliment he finds me so attractive. But it's far from that and I don't know how to get it through to him that I don't view it as something positive but something degrading.

Every person has been this way with me. It just furthers the idea that I'm the one that's not normal for not liking it and I've talked to friends and they don't see the big deal about it either."

Oh, honey, no. Just no. If, for some weird reason, my husband suddenly started raging and throwing things, I'd put myself between him and our son. I would never expect my son to protect me. It's a parent's job to look after their kid, not the other way around. 

Your mom should be proud of you for taking care of your sister like that. I'm just some random internet stranger, but I'm proud of you.

"That discussion was when we first got together. Around 6 years ago now. I knew she wasnt happy with them but she never mentioned having surgery for them since.

That would be like me saying to her ""i want to move to spain"" when we first got together, not mentioning it again and then one day taking our savings and getting on a plane.

..... i did tell you...."
It didn't make sense to me either. The position was for $13/hr
"I know he’s been stressed from work lately and he’ll blame that.

Nope-Dint let him do that ""We can talk about your work situation AFTER we talk about your lying to me.""

I would be tough.

""Im super disappointed that you lied to me throughout December by concealing your true plans -this is your third significant lie to me and its cause me to lose all trust for you. Not only did you lie but it was also incredibly disrespectful to allow me to make a lot of plans and put a lot of effort into organizing the weekend while you knew my plans were going to blown up. Im seriously questioning if this is how I want to be treated.  Id like you to spend some time thinking about why you thought it was ok to do this to me and MY kids-when you figure it out we can continue this talk. In the meantime I have plans with my kids and we will be busy.""

If he doesnt demonstrate some true effort and insight as well as a very specific plan as how to avoid a reoccurrence plus a plan -that he executes-on how to make it up to you and your kids I would just nope on out of there. And if he does anything els even remotely deceitful I would be done."

"It comes across as a bit thoughtless that you didn't wait for New Years when you know she wanted you to and she's having a hard time right now, just because you wanted to 'efficiently' maximise your vacation.

Sure, you can't fix her mother, but you can support HER. So it's not like there's actually nothing you can do."
"First, his ""lack of degrees"" does matter to him, and he likely wouldn't be acting this selfish if he were offered similar opportunities. He told me himself he's insecure about this. I haven't just assumed on my own.


Second, I'm well aware that he has feelings. I've talked to him many times, about many different aspects of our relationship (including this issue) and I plan on talking to him again. 


"
"It's either anxiety, which needs to be treated, or total selfishness, which there is no treatment for. 

I have to admit I have no patience for lateness. I myself have anxiety, and you know what really helps to reduce my anxiety? Having a plan and building in enough time to get where I need to be with time to spare, so I can relax and not stress. 

I deal with lateness by basically ignoring it. I do MY thing. In your case, I would have driven to the airport myself, with plenty of time to spare. If he made it on time, great. If not, I would have enjoyed the shit out of my solo vacation! I would not be in business with someone who was chronically late. I own a business and I fire people for that - it is a sign of deep disrespect. (I hired a cousin to work with me, and she was chronically late, and I let her stay too long because she's family, and it ended really badly. We no longer speak.) In the case of my cousin, Because of her lateness. I did not assign her to jobs she wanted, because I could not trust her to be on time. She threw major tantrums, but being late has consequences. With friends who are late, I give them deadlines. ""I'll be leaving my house at 5pm. If you're not here, I'm leaving without you."" And I DO. Even if they say ""I'm running 5 minutes late."" I mean maybe I'll wait 5 minutes, but usually ""5 minutes"" means ""an hour and a half"" for some people, so it depends on their track record. 

My point is, live YOUR life. If YOU need to leave at 5pm, leave at 5pm, and leave him behind. Even if it's a date night, go enjoy it yourself. Yes, he'll be mad and fume and stomp. Oh well, those are consequences. "
"This is a fantastic explanation of that instinctive negative reaction I have to the way some people use ""respect."" I never bothered to articulate it, but it's exactly this. "

"Just do it now. It will suck for both of you but it's better than dragging out the misery. I had to initiate the breakup because my ex didn't even though she said she ""didn't see a future with me"" but let me continue to try fix things to no avail. I knew she didn't love me but it was so hard to lose her. Just get it done with if you have made up your mind. "

"If you drink and drive, you're a bloody idiot!

&gt; Now i'm getting texts from my mom saying that I was disrespectful and that I need to learn to keep my mouth shut.

Your mum and/or her bf are probably still drunk. Give her another 24 hrs before having a conversation about it.

&gt; Luckily they made it home safe, but I feel like I'm getting chewed out for trying to be responsible by discouraging drinking and driving.

Does this mean they drove your sisters home while drunk?

&gt; This infuriates her boyfriend even further and his anger towards me glories. Calls me names and such.

An angry drunk on the road is even more dangerous. Now you know how he takes the concern from you, don't approach him about it next time, just call the cops on him and let the police sort him out. 

"
You should call cps. They will ensure the safety of your brother and will work with her. If she's depressed they will work on getting help
"And don't make it sound wishy-washy, it needs to be a ""no, and never"". 

It's a really hard conversation to have and you'll probably feel like you're going too far, but honestly it's better than the alternative. (He keeps trying to convince you because he's sure he'll eventually win you over)."
"Assuming he has never given her any reason to suspect that he has cheated or would cheat on her, excluding any instances where she suspected it as the result of only her own insecurity, I don't think you can really classify that as blind trust anymore. It's been 8 years for crying out loud. "
"Any of those ""common friends"" happen to be the same ones who had to apologize to you because they figured out he was gaslighting you? I would stop relying on their observational skills, first off. Maybe you need to consider the possibility that he is putting on a show precisely because his lack of character became public?

So what if he really IS a better partner now? That doesn't mean that his previous deficiencies were because of you! Decent people aren't ""driven"" to cheat on their girlfriends and treat them like garbage even if that girlfriend is a bad fit. They end the relationship. He was a bad person to you because he was a bad person. 

His supposed Prince Charming self wasn't locked away to only be opened by ""the right key"". His horrible past behavior doesn't get a pass or erased because of the new face he's presenting. It would help if he accepted responsibility for his actions. Then again, why should he admit he was a bad boyfriend? He's got you there making excuses for him.

Picture that self-esteem of yours as a vase. He was constantly dropping it, putting cracks and chips in it, but it was so spread out over time that you just kind of rolled with. Then he's gone and your left with a pretty fragile vase that you're not really fixing. And he comes back in, but this time concentrates all his previous careless disregard for your vase in one concentrated burst. Not surprising it has now shattered. 

You're determined to make yourself the bad guy here, and I don't think we're at the pay grade to convince you otherwise. Stop worrying about him and  go talk to someone about YOU.

"It's not because they're living with their girlfriends. You probably also have colleagues who are in a good place without girlfriends.

"&gt;Old ""friends"" came flooding back into my life. My ex's mother congratulated me 

How did they find out about this success of yours? Did you post about it somewhere, and people started coming out of the woodwork to say congrats, and re-connected from there?

Or did you land a spot, and out of nowhere, people you haven't heard from in years suddenly start calling up and asking for money or connections?

Or something else entirely?

&gt;Friends and even my SO eventually left me or whispered about me behind my back 

Is it at all possible that maybe the way you hold yourself and interact with people in general day-to-day life has changed in a way that makes you more pleasant to be around now that you're at a less stressful point in life? Is it possible that you have more time, and/or have become more outgoing and/or more ""in contact"" with the world now that school is done?

I don't want to make it sound like I assume it was ""your fault"" that you didn't hear from some people as much for a while- but I'm also wondering if maybe your ""cynical"" outlook might be leaning towards assigning more pessimistic motivations for people than necessary? I mean, are any of these people asking for anything from you?

I just can't see signs an road markings as soon as they can, and have to get pretty close to see what they say compared to daytime driving. The prescription doesn't make my eyes perfect and beyond that, he may have more than myopia, he might have stigmatism in one or both eyes. OP doesn't know his script so I don't think we can assume he can drive fine at night just because he has glasses."
"At this point I'd be wondering if you had a safer place to leave your dog than with your parents. Your boyfriend was actively violent to orchestrate your getting rid of the dog, but if your mom/parents see the dog as a sticking point in your ""ruining this"", then I wouldn't trust them not to passively remove the barrier, either by leaving a door open or rehoming him behind your back.

She doesn't trust you and won't ever on thus, she didn't listen to you and might never. 
This is to me more than a red flag but a deal breaker. She seems very controlling and will definitely go back to your parents or friends everytime you do something she doesn't like. 
You've only been together for 3 months, let her go. This is way too soon in a relationship to have this kind of breach of trust and I'm not sure you can ever come back from this.

"Can confirm. I live in Michigan which is a no fault divorce state and my husband went to prison for torturing me and attempted murder.

I was given everything in the divorce-granted he was in prison during the process-prisoners still have rights, however the judge treated this as an at fault divorce given the circumstances.

If OP can prove damage occurred, if it actually did (say she contracted a serious std from his cheating), there's usually an element of fault that can be upheld. Divorce isn't usually black and white, regardless of how clearly defined each states laws are.

Good luck OP."
"You've been dating for nearly 2 years. If what you're doing in bed wasn't sexually satisfying for him, don't you think he would've said something? Sounds like the only comparisons between you and his ex-partners are going on in your head, not in his.

&gt;the sex we have is pretty vanilla compared to what he has done in the past.

Just because things start vanilla doesn't mean they have to stay vanilla -- unless, of course, that's what you want. 

And for the record, LOTS of women can't come from PIV sex. You're not alone. He can help you along, by using a vibe on your clitoris while you have PIV sex, or you can do it yourself, depending on the position you're in. "

"You've only been together for a year. He's still putting his best face forward but now you've seen the cracks.

Nope. He's 25 fucking years old. This is completely unacceptable. Run, OP. **Run**. "
"So, I may be a bit biased here, because I'm a recreational smoker, and have some of the same feelings your SO has about marijuana, most specifically: 

&gt;He claims he can smoke this much because he never takes enough to get impaired high. Just enough to relax, not enough to bother his driving or anything. He says it doesn't effect him like most people. it just 'calms' him. And it's true, you wouldn't know he's smoking if you couldn't smell it.

I don't know your SO, but I want to point out that this is one of the ""medicinal"" properties of weed, that helps with anxiety, thinking much too quickly, making rash decisions, depression, and how marijuana helps with these correlated issues. I thought I would let you know this before I offered my opinion, so that you have more context about why I feel the way I do about it, personally. 

I think weed affects everyone differently. I don't think that there's a strand of weed out there that affect anybody the same way. I think the THC reacts with your personal body and brain chemistry, and for that reason, the effects can vary wildly. It's something to consider when you do research about how it all works. I've never read anything about it having an effect on fertility. 

**That being said:** 

1. You have every right to not want him to smoke in the house. It's not a pleasant smell for a lot of people, especially non-smokers, and it's just common courtesy to smoke it outside, where the smell won't be trapped  
2. He should not be spending a cent of your shared finances on his habit. Smoking pot should not be on your list of priorities if you're on a budget to pay off debt. That's simply not a responsible thing to do, and the fact that it's affecting you should be completely unacceptable.  
3. While the weed may be helping him ease his mind and body over his legitimate medical issues, weed is a treatment for exactly none of these things. It's a glorified, naturally-occurring painkiller, and putting a band-aid over your type-2 diabetes is not going to fix anything. 

The issue isn't the pot. The issue is his motivation to live a better life, not only for himself, but for you. Weed certainly helped me mull my life over, and make better decisions, but it definitely didn't help me get off my ass and take action. I had to find that within myself, but your boyfriend doesn't seem to interested in doing that. Which is real shame. 

You should re-think the TTC part until he's on more stable grounding with his life. "
"Because you are showing no empathy for his partner. You are fine with being a sugar baby meaning you are willing to sell yourself.

This comment alone is good enough evidence that you are either dumb as fuck or don't give a fuck about anyone else. Or both."
"I thought about that too, which is why I had my bf check with his mom and get the family recipes. It was her parents and sister that passed, so if anyone waa going to object, we thought it would be her."
"Contact a friend or family member or a boarding service to temporarily house your dogs. Get this done ASAP and as discreetly as possible. Prepare a suitcase/bag with your essentials in it, and keep it in your trunk, with a friend, etc. Find a place to live temporarily, then when it's safe, go. Change your phone number, delete all your social media accounts, and go completely no contact. If he finds you or starts to harass others call the police.

It is not your job to keep him alive, and it is wholly unlikely he will kill himself. You are your #1 priority. Get out of there."
"To be fair to the BIL and SIL, this wasn't their idea, and OP and his gf haven't actually even offered this to them yet. Although that is sort of a good thing because it means that OP and his gf can reconsider it before BIL and SIL even know that it's a possibility. "
"This post is really hitting home for me right now...as I've just (as in yesterday) had an LDR end over a similar lack of consideration. And I see those reasons all over this post. I may very well be projecting. 

OP, how often do you see him? How often does he go to see you? Why didn't you guys spend New Years together, your choice or his? 

Which leads to the big scary question. What do you honestly think would happen if you left Starbucks, and spent time with your parents, instead of waiting. Would he show up at your parents house apologising? Catch you before you left? 

Or would he just say ok. Just agrees. Doesn't recognise that his girlfriend prioritising seeing him over other family on her last day in town is a big deal. Doesn't recognise that sleeping in and forgetting to meet her is an even bigger deal. And larger still, that his girlfriend had to call multiple times and waited for at least two hours, alone. It's either that, or he does recognise it all...it just doesn't bother him enough to do anything about it. 

Do what you will with however you answer that for yourself. It's either going to make you think of your relationship differently, show what needs to be worked on, or highlight how things may be one sided. But it's a place to start."
"Not only would it cause a dangerous scare, but if they're a traditional hispanic family then all three boys going to meet the business end of a chancla, regardless of age. Also, interrupting a quince is like interrupting a bat mitzvah- it's rude and selfish. I'd tell someone."
"Even when the wife and I agree not to exchange gifts I still get her a little something small and sentimental.  Giving is an extension of your love for another, and it sounds like he's had plenty of opportunity to turn this around.  "
"No, you already admitted to having a fucking crush on him beforehand, don't try and play it off as ""Oh I was drunk and he was hot."" Bullshit and we all know it and so would your sister if you present it that way. Tell her and accept the fact that you fucked up beyond repair, honestly. There isn't anything you can do to make this better. Let her know and the accept the consequences of losing your sister due to your selfish actions. "
"&gt; You're judging her as if she is your girlfriend

I think you missed the part where I said I would react the same way to any of my friends, guy or girl, doing something this distasteful. My problem is I'm not into who she was when drunk so I'm not sure if I should follow through with my plans or not.

It's really eye-opening to see how many people qualify her actions by just saying she's young and single. I can guarantee the topic would be riddled with ""he's a douche, don't bother"" comments if it was a guy. Just shocking to see how quickly people will go to her defence and start to vilify me when I didn't even say she was wrong to do any of what she did, only that it confused me."
Who ever could have seen that coming... smdh
"Make a list of what you are planning to take.
If its too big to take with you and you bought it get a monetary number that you are comfortable with for him to pay you for it.


When you are ready wait for him to walk in FORCE the discussion with list in hand and state what you are taking and what you are not and if he refuses to still talk or walks off just leave with your stuff and forget the rest, write that off as cost of relationship ending."
"Let's be honest, it's because *you* don't want to feel bad getting in an awkward or emotional conversation. You know she is going to feel bad about getting ghosted."
"&gt; he feels like he's degrading himself when he has sex with a girl he thinks isn't skinny enough. But he doesn't feel that way with me because I'm so much smarter than the rest of the girls. 

What a gross, condescending way to look at women. He might say you're ""special"" now, but when the honeymoon period is over, he will look at you with the same contempt he clearly has for women. This guy has major issues, and he doesn't like women, period. Get out."
If you need to threaten and scare someone into paying attention to you then your relationship is already over. Jesus Christ. Just move on.
"No! Your SO mocking you in front of other people and giving you the finger is so not ok. And then he has a go at you for being ""unreasonable""?! Fuck him. In your shoes I *might* be able to forgive his behaviour in the car as drunken ass-hatery IF he apologized for it, but your guy sounds completely unabashed by his disgusting treatment of you (to say the least - from what you've written it sounds like he was practically gloating over it when you got home) . Your reaction is completely justified and he's gas-lighting you. "
"OP said in the post that the kids are 2.5 and 5 years old... How are they going to sustain a household with young kids on just 2k a month? 

Also, your math isn't accurate. $75k saved for 5 years is $375k. Double that, and it's $750k. OP is 35 years old and her husband is 40. Let's assume they'll need money until they're 80 or so. So for 40 years, that $750k will be roughly $1.5k per month. That's not even taking into account inflation, emergency needs, or the kids' college tuitions. 

Sure, $1.5k a month is doable... But going from a current $300k/year salary to living on $1.5k for a family of four is probably not what OP wants... "
"You are not over reacting, he behaved like a total dickhead and flipping you off is the icing on a very shitty cake. It's easy for us to say dump him. But you deserve so much better. Apart from his appalling behaviour (and remember in vino veritas-he's shown you exactly who he is, and how much he respects you,) I reserve **major** side eye when one person is always the designated driver. 

Honey, you can do so much better. Happy new year."
"I am my nephew's legal guardian, but I have not adopted him."
"I suppose white supremacists are cool in your book, too?"
"When I read this post, what I see is someone who was never quite valued (as someone else put it -- 'a spare child') and has a lot of hurt inside because of it. Her behavior is certainly not that bad, she could treat her boyfriends better of course, but the way you and your family seem to treat her is as if she's a criminal. I really think she's the scapegoat of the family -- OP you might try googling dysfunctional family roles and read up on the scapegoat position.

I agree with another poster when they said that your sister is probably going to abandon your family in the next few years; and I'm sure you'll all speak badly of her for doing so, instead of questioning why she felt the need to do it."
Hahah that's awesome. 
"He DID ask beforehand, though. Had to, to have the recipes ..."
Except it doesn't work like that. Maturity doesn't ever make up for lack of experience. Your current problem is proof enough of that.
[deleted]
I think that it's pretty reasonable of her to be weirded out and consider it a dealbreaker but on the other hand it's not objectively wrong or bad? I guess you have to decide whether your *super young girlfriend of three months who the only good thing you say about her is that she's physically attractive* is more important to you than your friendship with your ex wife
"Wow. 

I commend you for already knowing you are completely cutting your parents out of your life. 

If I were you, I'd cook yourself a nice fancy meal at your sisters and enjoy an evening by yourself while everyone attends the shit show of a dinner at your parents'. You and I both know that it will not only be really awkward, but after your father has managed to binge drink enough at dinner, he WILL say or do something towards you. You are now his target. I wouldn't even entertain my other family members because of his presence. Kindly back out of dinner and all you need to explain to family, if you feel the need, is: 


""I will not be attending any holiday dinners at my parents from here on out. An incident occurred that id rather not speak of in depth, although the behavior that was shown to me is absolutely inexcusable. I can no longer pretend my fathers behavior is normal and refuse to put myself in a position where I can be bullied. Thank you for your understanding and if there are family gatherings in the future elsewhere, I will gladly join. As long as my parents and I are not seated at the same table. I hope everyone has a wonderful Christmas and I hope you can understand why I am unable to join, thank you"" 

Your parents deserve 0 effort on your part to mending anything at this point. I'm sorry your trip to Iceland has been soured by your fathers horrible attitude. Ironically I am in Iceland now reading your story. Here for holidays with family (away from my alcoholic narcissistic mother who remains in the states). Your story hits too close to home for me. I hope your Christmas is wonderful. If only you were still in Iceland id invite you to our Christmas dinner. 

Make the best of this alone time. I wouldn't shed a single tear for them my dear. They don't deserve it. You are far better off without those kinds of people bringing you down. Still can't believe the audacity of your father though. He is a poor excuse of a man to do that to their adult child. 

Venture over to r/raisedbynarcissists 

That community has helped me immensely.  Good luck to you and merry Christmas / gleðileg jól vinnur mín. "
"Desperation drives women away like the plague. 

Seriously dude. This whole, ""I need to get a woman, it doesn't matter who"" attitude is absolutely counterproductive. How do you think a woman would feel if she was with you and found out you have that attitude? She'd feel like there's nothing special about her, that she was just some hole you could park your dick in, that she just happened to be the one dumb enough to fall for your shit.

If you don't value yourself, why should a woman value you?"
"And what exactly is your experience? From mine, which is being fairly up to date on the news and having several cops in my family, I know they tend to treat crimes, like hit and runs, almost *as if it were their job to follow up.*

"This is your parents problem in the long run, I would suggest before leaving sit down with him and make it clear he crossed way to many lines and need to apologize to you and yours. Then ask him if everything is okay at home. A burst of anger over grabbing someone a beer means one of two things, either the way the request was given was improper or the the way the request was heard was misunderstood. At the end of the day tho you aren't his parent and unless your guys parents are harming him, it's their responsibility to discipline and try to resolve the issue "
"Oh my gosh YES, some foods are even off limits and they've told me I'll go to hell for eating such things etc. they don't do any labor on their sabbath day either, whatever that entails, they sit around and be lazy basically. But he still won't classify it as any one religion, he just picks and chooses new ""rules"" they have to follow in order to get to heaven. "
"It's pretty standard that there will always be some form of comments made towards interracial couples. Plus you gotta remember, different cultures, races, etc, all have different styles of socializing. Nothing they said seemed racist at all, let alone offensive. I'm black myself, and all their comments were more or less general black guy banter. That's why you're girlfriend didn't seem offended or see them in a negative connotation.

Best of luck."
"Thank you so much for your help. I really appreciate it.

"Yeah.  They didn't have sex, they just made out.  *rolls eyes* dump the girl.  Also your brother should be dead to you now. Might want to tell your parents whats up too.  "
"I think you're making a mistake in saying you have ""more needs"" instead of realizing you and your wife have **different** needs. You aren't just looking forward more sex, you're looking for different sex. Maybe she is too."
"My family does that a lot, and we all hate it because we never actually go get that thing we have the picture of. And if the gift comes from someone you share finances with you're not actually getting them a gift, you're giving them permission to go buy themselves something with their own money. "
You mention being sober 24/7 for the first time in years. How often were you usually drinking/using? What were your substances of choice? Did he used to join in? Has he started abstaining too?

"You need to tell the Bride.  If I knew one of my bridesmaids was acting like Erica, I would kick her out of the party.  This *is not* petty drama.  Erica started a rumor that you didn't want to be in the wedding anymore, what if that gets back to the bride through the grapevine?  She needs to know that her plan failed and Erica is being a drama-llama."
"You've asked this question no less than 3 times in the last week. We've given the same answer every time;

Doesn't sound like overkill to me. Kid needs to be taught a lesson and water is utterly harmless.

"My friend is upset and I want her to feel better, even though she made a bad decision. To me, that is a true friend. 

I know she's wrong and I think she knows that too. I just wanted some advice on what to say to help."
"Your gf sounds like she is about to bounce and her friends are the reason. Sorry bro but this has nothing to do with you or horrible situation. It sounds like she likes having fun with her friends and being around you is too real or something. Tbh, I'm surprised that this didn't make you want to break up almost immediately. 

New Years is one of the most irrelevant of all party days. To not want to support you in anyway and just be there for you and your family(who she's met and has rapport with), I think it says where you are on the list of priorities. Not very high at the moment. That can change in sure but is that really the situation you want to be in? There are empathetic people out there who know how to have fun but also know when it's time to put on the big boy/girl pants. I'd say thanks but no thanks and move out asap. "
"Passion and lust comes and goes. If you have an otherwise awesome relationship, good sex, and you are always at least a LITTLE attracted to him, I don't think its the time to break up. You are not repulsed by him. You think he looks or acts silly sometimes. So what? I used to think the same thing about my now fiancé. It's normal IMO, it's normal to want to change something or kinda get annoyed with them about xyz or something they can't control. 

My best advice is, next time you find yourself thinking those thoughts about how annoying he looks, catch yourself and then remind yourself what you love about him and your relationship-looks or otherwise. Even if you broke up and found the most gorgeous man on earth, it's likely that's all he would be. And looks fade honey.  ;) 
 
Don't break up.  

Edit: re-read your post and wanted to add when you're with someone, there are going to be times that they aren't going to ""do it"" for you. That's just life. When you're with someone for a LONG time they're going to change. And you won't necessarily like all their changes but then one change, you will like. I used to get really really embarrassed about my fiances belly. He's very thin, and Pakistani men have bellys. But then I was like, you know what? Who gives a shit. And when we have sex it kinda rubs my clit a little so Its really nothing to complain about 😜 ultimately though, it's not about having a perfect attraction all the time. It's about seeing and appreciating what *is* there between you, as the attraction fades in and out. Plus men get sexier with age."
"No, it's not normal you should be wishing death on your sibling. Honestly it does sound like maybe she has some OCD or obsessive cleaning issues, and isn't all that easy to live with but from your description I'm also getting a picture that you're (at least) 5 adults in a small living space. And likely it's a hoarder / too much stuff kinda situation as well. That's just not right, nor does it make it a great situation for anyone or easy to deal with - speaking from experience it's VERY stressful. 

If I were you I'd move out ASAP and start my own life, while trying to get your sister some therapy if possible. 

ETA: why can't you buy your own tampons? Why can't your mom use her own hand cream? These anecdotes scream ""boundary issues"" to me as someone who has family members with extreme boundary issues (no privacy allowed, expects us all to share everything but then what's theirs is THEIRS only). IMO I don't think saying ""please don't use all the tampons"" or ""no, go use your own hand cream"" is being selfish - it's just trying to set boundaries which y'all obviously can't or won't abide by. This is a toxic environment. Too bad your sister can't ditch you all, but you're plenty old enough so you should remove yourself from the situation. 

ETA2: Ok, so I see there are cultural issues that are a contributing factor but the way I see it is this: you're fine with status quo of your culture and lifestyle but your sister is not. Moving to anywhere else is probably the best for her. I know someone exactly like this who hates the things about living in Singapore that others love. She lives in Canada now. Wishing there were less people around is normal because so many adults shouldn't be sharing a WC. Should your sister be more considerate with her time? Probably. But from my perspective she's also trying to eke some space and time back for herself. A lot of people end up retreating to bathrooms for peace because it's the only place they can get any in their house."
"
&gt;I actually had to go back and recheck the ages because I thought this might be a guy in his early 20s who's on his first serious relationship and just hasn't had to stand up to Mom yet.  But at 29?!

This is literally exactly what I just went through with this post."
That's a lot of generalizations you have there.
"My sister is a Christian and I'm an atheist. She will only marry someone who is willing to go to church every Sunday, who loves Jesus as much as she does. I could not be with someone that religious, and maybe not even religious at all, because that would be uncomfortable and unpleasant for me. Is she wrong? No. Am I wrong? No. But there can still be red flags. She may support [Rep] candidate and she might date someone who also supports [Rep] candidate, but if that person goes to rallies and protests and spends hours waving signs talking about how bad [Dem] candidate is, that might be something I think she shouldn't get involved with. I don't care if her SO likes [Rep] candidate but if he's at a different level than her, it could be bad. "

"I second looking into Dental college. I went to one near where I used to live for braces (they had a Dental &amp; Orthodontics school) &amp; the braces were $2k versus the almost $6k I had an Orthodontist quoting me about 5yrs before that.

"They do gifts at Christmastime, OP meant Christmas Day. It's crystal clear from all the context. She got his present early, he got her nothing. He decided to just totally ignore her even though they always exchange gifts and she'd already gotten him one. Why do you think that is okay?"

Please make an effort to call him by his new name. Everyone has the right to decide how they should be called"
"I'd suggest that you go back and watch some of her vlogs and read some of the blogs to see if you can get an idea for what she's feeling regarding the baby, too. It's likely that she's mentioned being stressed about it. "
"Your point of view baffles me. There's no need to ""hate yourself"" to want to change one's name. I know several happy, well-adjusted people who changed their names, for a variety of reasons ranging from ""I wanted a slightly different version of the same name"" through ""trans, given name is the wrong gender"" up to ""I never liked that given name anyway.""

And most of their parents handled it just fine. It is perfectly conceivable for a parent to be okay with this kind of thing.

It sounds like you view your given name as a huge part of how you view yourself and your part in the world. And that's fine! It's clearly very important to you that you stick with the name you were given. Fortunately, no one is likely to make you change your name; you can love it heartily as much as you like. But that has no real bearing on why other people might want to change their own names."
"Yes, exactly! I would be absolutely livid if my boyfriend did this!"
"25 and 17 is a huge red flag. No 25 year old in their right mind pursues a teenager because it's such an unhealthy dynamic. In the long run, you'll realize he's either manipulating you because he's interested in how young and vulnerable you are or he's a loser who's genuinely still in the mindset of a 17 year old. Neither are good for you. You have way too many experiences ahead of you in the next few years to spend them tied down to this dude who should be past all of this. Cut your losses now and end this situation before it gets too serious."
"Your boyfriend is overreacting. A lot of people are uncomfortable kissing in front of other people. It's not unusual for couple who have been together a long time to be more chaste when it comes to kissing in public, particularly in front of friends and family. If your boyfriend measures the strength of your relationship on how passionate each kiss is, then he needs to get over his insecurities. You shouldn't feel shamed for being uncomfortable. "

"So I've had several relationships where I've had safewords (including my husband) and if anything, using the safeword during non-kinky times would have shown even more concern. Because if we're not playing and saying no isn't enough to stop something,  resorting to an automatic reaction to a safeword is really a last resort. And OP says he doesn't even react immediately to the safeword. He just has no respect whatsoever for her opinions about how he should touch and interact with her. "

"Honestly the difference in scenario is this.

One feels like you having a baby with your gf

One feels like your gf having a baby for someone else.

Either way the end result is the same, the baby isn't yours. The difference in the second scenario the baby isn't yours nine months sooner. 

You are uncomfortable with the scenario where you can't pretend this will be your child and that makes me very very concerned that you aren't ready for this child to be not yours and your gfs. You might be ready to have a child with her, but you aren't ready to give it away."
"My husband didn't because he thought my controlling, cold father would say ""no""...and he was probably right."
"I have insanely bad allergies. Like so bad my regular doctor and my allergist (that I see every three weeks) have both told me that my allergies are severe and almost impossible to treat. So I know how bad allergies can get. I have a lot of compassion for other people who have allergies.

That said, putting a pet outside that is used to being inside is insane. It's dangerous for the dog, for a multitude of reasons. The dog might panic and escape, or get hurt, or even be stolen (I wish I were kidding). The weather is a factor too. An inside dog won't be used to the cold, and would also be unprepared for other animals that might approach it. It is completely unacceptable to put an inside dog outside, particularly overnight, or for an extended period of time.

That said, it's also rude to just assume someone will accommodate you anyway. You're a guest. Instead, the onus is really on you. If you don't like someone's decisions for their own house, then don't stay there. It's the same thing when people complain that their parents won't let them sleep with their SOs when they come home to visit. If you don't like the rules, stay elsewhere. It's just polite.

Although since it is family, I don't think they'd mind if you asked for a more appropriate and less stressful accommodation for your allergies. The dogs could be locked in the bedroom while you're actively visiting, for example. Or you could spend more of the visit out of the house itself. Or just ask if you can vacuum the bedroom after the dogs have gone home. If your allergies aren't that severe, vacuuming should help a lot. Just don't go in the bedroom while the dogs are there."
"Ah, great. At least there's one thing we can cross off of the list."

"Probably better that OP knows, since she's wisely decided to avoid his mom.  If she were ignorant of mom's terrors, then she'd walk right into a trap.

The craziest part is she secretly flies out of the country to avoid meeting OP.  Wouldn't you start prying if you noticed that your SO's unemployed mom kept flying to Canada or Bermuda on a moment's notice, coincidentally on the days you were set to meet?"
"Sometimes families are ""big and happy"" because dissent is not tolerated and anyone who rocks the boat is quickly shut up."
"I'm trying so hard to break my boyfriend if this habit. He speaks in normal volume in English, but if he switches to his native language he practically shouts into the phone. "
"You're usurping his preferences and making them about you. Yes, that's a problem. It's an insecurity.

It sounds like maybe you guys shouldn't have an open relationship. It's not your place to decide how much effort he puts into chasing a girl (unless you have specific mutually-agreed-upon rules, like ""We can't spend more than $50 on dates"") and again, you're co-opting it to make *his* pleasure and interest about *you.*

&gt;I find it difficult to separate love and sex.

Again, that's good *for you.* He is not you.

I would strongly suggest talking to someone. Some of what you said seems to just be insecurity to me based on this small wall of text; some other things you said made me think you may not have such a positive relationship with sex.

&gt;but to have 5 strangers come in you in the span of 12 hours seemed really unhealthy to me - psychologically and physically.

You're not sex positive. You're trying to be, but you need to realize that if you are sex positive, it's not your place to judge. If the girl and the guys are okay with it, then your place as a sex positive person is to be okay with it. Your place is not to say, ""I know you think it was a good time, but I think you psychologically damaged yourself."""
"Two things scream out to me. 
1. He's not in love with you. 
2. You have repeatedly invaded his privacy by reading his personal writings.

Okay, 4 things. 
3. Get some therapy for those horrible insecurities. 
4. DTMFA"
I'm really glad you asked here before going ahead with it.  Take care of yourself.
"&gt;He has tried to have sex with me when I'm passed out drunk / almost asleep, and then when I ask him about it the next day he says he doesn't remember.

This is not a little thing.  This is a huge giant glaring red flag.  He doesn't care about your consent.  Dump sooner rather than later, IMO."
What's wrong with buying clothes from Target? :(
"I realize now that I'm never gonna hear an apology from her. However, I'm not the type of person that forgives easily. I feel like unless I get a sincere apology, I'll be resentful and I don't want that. I guess that's why people say forgiveness is a gift to yourself and not others"
"Stop giving her attention when she's doing her performances. Might get worse a little while, but in the long run, she'll learn to get attention elsewhere."
You deserve better just stop making excuses. You're turning into an enabler and it's just going to spiral from here. Who in your family was the addict? Is your dad around? Why would you want to have a life with this guy?
"Nope, nope, nope. This isnt anything but what the other commentor said, creepy friend zone guy that wants more, more, more. 

Just let this girl go for your own mental health. This is going no where, accept that and move on please. "
"Part of your parent's patience should require them being consistent with punishment and consequences over a long period of time. While a lot of teens this age can be pure little shits, he also is being taught that he can get way with it, and that his autism is an excuse to not be held to the same standard as everyone else. That isn't necessarily preparing him for a world which will likely be less forgiving than mother and father - and they are *too* forgiving at that.

You allude to the fact that your brother is harassing and assaulting you? Honestly,  defend yourself when you don't feel safe. (While being careful and mindful to not escalate - remain verbally calm and do not extend to the physical offensive.) You shouldn't have to tolerate feeling threatened or be (potentially) abused by your brother all because he has autism. Now is the time to set the standard. Granted, I'm not a professional on autism - I might consult with someone, potentially his therapist (he has one?) if nobody will listen to you. "
"I agree with most of the commens down here, but I also want to add another perspective.

You see, I myself live in Amsterdam and I know firsthand how bad the neighboring noises can get, even if these people are trying to stay silent. We actually had a neighbor who illegaly rented out his appartment (they rented the appartment themselves, and would then rent a seperate part of it out with something like AirBnB). The noise was awfull, especially when we were trying to sleep. These people were often students and would be up untill 05:00/06:00 AM. Now they were just talking, not even throwing partys. Add to that the fact that they were illegally there, and I'm sure you can understand why this might piss someone off. Yet, even if this were your case, it is up to your host to fix it. In my opinion, he is the only one to blame for it. I'd try to get a refund / move. AirBnB should help you with that.

To make a long story short, I do understand where the neigbor is coming from, especially if you guys stay up late talking. These are old, wooden houses and you hear everything. I do think, however, that your host is to blame, for he should have had second thoughts with renting out the space in the first place."
"It seems like he values leisure while you value success and ambition. Both are valid lifestyles.  Instead of trying to load him down with chores or make him bust his ass for more money or a better job, why not decide if you would prefer a less stressful lifestyle as well, take on a different job and enjoy your friggin life.  Nobody needs 6 figures to live a happy life."
"Just FYI, the idea that the phrase ""the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb"" is the origin of ""blood is thicker than water"" is an urban legend. This phrase can't be found in any old or reputable sources, whereas ""blood is thicker than water"" can be found in tons of old sources. I agree with the sentiment, though. "
"Take time to grieve and feel sad, you need this after the ending of such a long relationship. 

But when you start moving forward, think about this from his side. He is working hard to pay all the bills, and his older, 29 year old girlfriend has been living with him rent free and is taking a long time to finish school. She has offered to help out but he feels bad because she is so broke all the time. He is getting his life going, and she's 4 years older and still quite a bit behind. Is this the person he should marry and spend his life with? Is he going to be supporting her in 10 years? What's the likelihood she's going to finish school soon and be able to bring in meaningful income so they can buy a house, take a nice vacation, or save for retirement?

I'm not trying to be mean, and being an older student and starting later is tough. But you're an adult and being independent is your responsibility. You shouldn't ask him if he wants rent from you, it should be assumed that you're giving him rent. If you're not working enough to give him rent, then finishing school quickly should be a priority and it shouldn't be taking 6+ years to get a bachelor's degree.

You are a capable and independent person. Let him go and focus on what you need to do to get on with your life, and get to a place where you can take care of yourself without relying so heavily on someone else to provide for you."
Oh man that guy would get the fucking beating of his life. Nobody touches my guitar without asking. 
"Thank you. We will definitely be going to the funeral, which will probably be mid next week. We as a family are decently close, so I don't think it would be odd for me to try and grow closer. My little cousin is basically an only child now, so I really want to try and be a good sister figure for her (even more so now). 

I appreciate your advice and kind words. I also thank you for your middle paragraph. That wasn't something I immediately thought of, but everyone we usually celebrate with is on this side of the family, so that is very helpful. "
"My sister was cheated on by her husband (Gary). The woman he cheated with, Mary, cheated on her husband Jerry. Well, Mary and Gary loved each other and decided to move in together. Jerry and my sister were now all alone, with kids, and my sister was pregnant. They became friends and one thing led to another, and they became a couple. So, they traded spouses essentially. They eventually got married and did stay married for about 9years until it all came crashing down. When I asked my sister about getting together with Jerry, she said that at the time she was really attracted to him. But in retrospect, it was the weird emotions she was feeling that led them together (being cheated on, loneliness, fear of the future, wanting to be wanted, etc). It blinded her judgement. She wishes that she had waited a few years before she entered a relationship. Then, she might have seen the red flags with Jerry. 

Anyhow, I guess what I'm saying is I have no clue what you should do, but I think it would be wise to be single for a little bit and focus on healing. Then, if you still like James, you will know it's because of actually liking him and not because of your weird and complicated situation. You need time to heal. Entering something now would be a bad idea in my opinion. At least that's how my sister felt. "
"Your concerns are both legitimate and not. There are a lot of girls who care about that. There are also a lot who don't.

The best sex I have ever had was with a guy with a very small penis. But I didn't care. Why? He cared about my orgasm(s). He went down on me, fingered me, etc. Besides that, when we were having sex, he would make sure to give me stimulation (rubbing my clit) which is something I told him I liked. Point is, sex is way. Way. WAY more than just ""penis in vagina.""

My current SO also has a smaller member, but every time we are together it gets better and better.

Basically, my point is, though you may get shot down by girls who care about that, you will find someone who doesn't for sure."
"&gt;  So what's the problem this time?

Because he prefers spending New Year's with someone else, I assume. That is a big deal in my book."
"They've been brothers for 13 years!

That part of the title is adorable to be honest."
"I've been in the same situation for years. I've begun to believe him.. but I'm old now and there is nothing left for me.
Please don't let your life end so young with someone who doesn't treat you like a human being."
Abusive people are very manipulative and have the ability to make you feel weak. Don't let him do this to you anymore. 
Anyone you are still in contact with and visit regularly. Beyond question. It's simply disrespectful not to. 
"I can't imagine not defending my fiancée from anyone that talked shit about her and if it was my parents I would lose my shit. 

I'd be worried about where he lacks a backbone in other areas of life too."
"I think you're right... I'm just scared because I haven't been strong enough in the past... 

Do you think it's okay for me to just leave without telling him goodbye or anything? Or maybe just leave a note? We were about to move so all of my things are already moved out, I'm thinking about leaving today.. Maybe while he's still asleep but I don't know how to go about actually doing it... I just want to cuddle up to him while he's sleeping :( "
"not sure if ""husbring"" was intentional, but hilarious given the context"
"It is, literally, a fucking fetish. "
Strongly disagree with you. It makes no sense to post an intimate picture for the world to see to boost her confidence when she doesn't even send her SO pictures for him to comment on. That was absolutely stupid and disrespectful of her and he has every right to feel hurt by this 
"May be time to experiment then. If you tag him and he freaks out, that would be a bad sign. "
"lol you were like ""what do you mean i'm submissive?"" and then he was like stay outside. he SHOWED you what he meant by you being submissive! "
He prioritizes his relationship with his toxic ex over maintaining your trust. Is that the kinda guy you want to be with?
"&gt; OP isn't ""pouting over something she did twenty years ago.""

Yes, he is. He's upset over his wife's TEENAGE sexuality. That's pretty sad. Yes, some spoiled little high school kid got a few blow jobs in '95 in the back seat of his dad's car from some insecure teenage girl. The horror. Let's not romanticize or idealize what happened here.  He's grown now and needs to act like it."
"I'm in 100% agreement with you.  This post actually has me angry.  Fuck that guy!  These critters learn to trust us and depend on us.  It takes a stone cold asshole to just want to abandon a part of the family.  And if my partner doesn't consider them a part of the family, they are not my partner!

Edit:  Not just abandon.  But abuse and then abandon!  I would like to reiterate, fuck this guy!"
"To my ears it doesn't sound like they are close in the way you're implying at all. 

Consider if your jealous reactions might end up driving him away. He can't help that this woman works with him, and obviously he already feels the need to walk on eggshells when mentioning her (""don't be mad""). In reacting the way you are, you're also implying that he might be a cheater. That must feel awful for him."
"Got her Twitter from her Twitch account. Got her full name from her Twitter. From there, Facebook. 

Edit: and then from his Facebook, I recognized one the followers as a play on his name. I checked and the profile pics were the same people. "
"I don't know why everyone is giving you ideas for cheaper rings.  That's totally not the point.  The point is the only reason she wants to marry you is your bank balance.....  Like now you earn enough you can marry her....  What.  No no no.  What would happen if you lost your job next week. She would be off like a shot.  She's the absolute definition of gold digger.  You should sit her down and talk to her and her reaction is going to tell you whether you need to break up.  

I'd have a chat and point out to her... She's 20....thats too young to be getting married... You haven't been going out long enough....  You don't agree that spending so much money on a ring and wedding is wise is the current financial climate... And when you want to propose you will do it on your own merit not because you feel pressured into it  but because the time is right for both of you.  

If she starts kicking and screaming at that,  then you need to think about whether she's actually marriage material.  When she starts kicking and screaming about all this... Please come back and update us.  I'm a sucker for it. "
"My ex used to expect it of me. ""If you're not hiding anything then it shouldn't be a problem."" That shit used to piss me off more than anything. Not that I ever had something to hide, but by principal, if you think can't trust me then what the fuck is the point anyway? It's not ok to go through someone's phone. "
OPs daughter is a couple months younger than PTSD-mom's child. First paragraph.

"Okay. It's good that multiple people are all saying that, makes it less likely that he was putting on an act. I think you should have an honest conversation with him, then, hopefully he will listen. "
Everyone has tried telling her before. 
"Thank you, we're all having breakfast tomorrow morning so it will be very interesting to say the least.; and, I agree that his reaction shows that this is an ongoing issue so I highly doubt he will be apologetic. However, one can only hope that he sees what he did was wrong (or at least my mother will see)."
"If she stays on her current course of gaining weight, will that turn into a major problem within your relationship?

Should she be aware of any major problems within your relationship, before it is too late?

Yes, hearing this is going to be very hard for her, even when put forward with the best of intentions.  If the alternative is a breakup in the long-term perspective it is something she needs to hear, sooner rather than later.  I'd hold off until at least a little while after the holidays, though.

I feel like I'm just rephrasing what you already seem to know, so I'm sorry if it isn't adding much.  Perhaps you should show her this post, it seems to be phrased pretty well."
"""well I'm glad you guys believe me over those unfounded accusations, but I'm still trying to avoid situations where I'm alone with little boys!"""
"To add onto this, I bought a really good glass screen protector off Amazon for ~$12,  so she could get him one of those "
"In my workplace, I try not to pick sides and to be friendly with everyone, including the isolated one colleague. Now they just pair me up with him, seeing me as his ""bridge"" to the main group. 

Buuuuut somehow everyone just gossips about everyone. Who knows what they are say behind my back! I've already heard of something like I'm ""the hardworking maid"". This is a toxic working environment."
I doubt you would have risked being homeless for that experience.
"No one is entitled to someone else's body, their marrow, blood, organs, etc. They have not consented to do so, so let it go."

"It happened over the phone, and I explained in another comment that she won't talk to me again over the phone about this.

I think the best suggestion is to just talk to my sister about it. No dramatic exposure or recordings. "
It's not like you called up his mom and tattled. You corrected a lie that he told her. Anyone who thinks you should've kept your mouth shut then is wrong. 
"It sounds even worse than just a respect issue.  If he knows that his behavior can give you UTI's and he purposefully still does nothing, that's fairly sociopathic.  Certainly abusive and manipulative at it's most basic level.  "

"I've done it twice, and both times they were stunned into sputtering silence and left me alone thereafter. The trick is to say it in a matter of fact, neutral tone. If you make it a dig, they can build more drama from it."
That you need serious professional help. 
Both cases were pretty rude. Especially the scene in Starbucks. That's obnoxious. Hard to believe this is a grown man. I have a cousin that acts like that. I refuse to go anywhere with her.
I advise getting something in writing from the landlord confirming you have been removed from lease and have no liability for rent or anything.
"But it does help. If you go by Brian Smith it's pretty borning and common but at least it's simple and unobtrusive and doesn't cause you the other problems that you have with Elderwand of people assuming it's fake or whatever. It seems like you don't want the super unusual name but also aren't keen to use the super common one. I would pick the common one any day, at least it won't create any roadblocks."
"Once again, I don't kiss because I have control issues and would have trouble stopping at just kissing. There's nothing ridiculous about protecting myself."
"I wasn't going to say go that far, but I wanted to.  Affairs thrive in the dark, if you want to truly smother this in its crib you need to drag it into the light, do not allow her any time in fantasy land to build walls; force her to come to terms with every last thing she's done.  The longer they're allowed to exist in fantasy land the longer it takes to drag their head out of their asses.  The catch 22 is that the betrayed does don't want to hurt their partners so they think being nice and gentle will work, but you just have to think of this as chemo, it may feel cruel at first because the assholes try will act like they've been hurt by it in the short term, but the end goal is killing the cancer and that trumps everything."
"Which province are you in? A lot of provinces have common-law legislation, which generally kicks in after a certain number of years of living together. If you are common-law you have a lot of the same rights and responsibilities as someone who is married.

For example if your common-law spouse dies intestate (without a will) you will have a right to their property. You also have homestead rights and rights to half of the value of any property purchased during the relationship. 

The funny thing is that in a lot of provinces it's easier to get divorced or dissolve a common-law relationship that has been registered rather than one that was assumed after a period of living together. For example in MB if you become common-law after living together for 3 years you can be required to live apart for 3 more years before being able to dissolve the relationship. However if you register the relationship with vital statistics you would only have to live apart for one year. 

Just google your province name and common-law legislation and you'll see exactly what you're working with. Beyond that I think your bf is being ridiculous and I think you should protect yourself, you don't need to be left high and dry if things go south."

"You're looking for different housing and a personal income, that's all you can do right now. He is amazing for accepting you cheating with your ex and phrasing it like it was **just** a one-night stand. You are the one who needs to make **him** feel secure that you won't do it again while being self-sufficient enough that if he decides he can't be with you, he isn't tossing you on the street. 3 months is a long time to wait but he deserves all the time he needs. If you can't accept that, you need to leave."

Woah. Is there anything else going on in either of your lives at all? If he'd got everyone socks and pyjamas that's one thing but he didn't. Unless he didn't think you cared about presents this just seems thought thoughtless bordering on uncaring 
"Time to reassess whether this relationship is a good'un. What he did was amazingly disrespectful to you and your family. Surely he should have been interested in getting to know your family or at the very least try to make a good impression. He clearly doesn't think you matter enough, so why did he even agree to come?!"
"I'm guessing you've never had anyone in your life that pushed you to the breaking point?

It happens, and it has no bearing on whether or not your husband is otherwise a loving and caring person. In fact, as a defense mechanism, behaving this way towards his brother is what allows him to maintain balance in the rest of his life.

Your family sounds great. Cherish that. However, don't judge your husband's behavior based on your relationships with your sisters. It's disrespectful of everything your husband has been through in his relationship with his family members.

Apologize to your husband for pushing the issue. Admit that you were viewing this through your own relationships with your own family and not from his perspective. Then, drop it. Defer to your husband's feelings about his brother going forward."
It's honestly scary how fast it happened. I didn't even really notice it until she had to throw away her old clothes and buy new ones. 
"The easiest answer is no, don't do it. 

The second best answer is, no, don't do it unless you can fully finance the trip if things go south once you're there:

1. Let's say he gets angry with you for refusing to do something physical with him. He booked your hotel &amp; outbound flight. He cancels both. Can you afford to fix it on short-notice pricing? 

2. Let's say he promised you a hotel room because it's sketchy to stay at his home. He's even sent you a screenshot of the confirmation. Once you get there, you discover that he's already secured his own room key to your hotel, so you have no space to yourself. What do you do?

3. Let's say he's absolutely charming &amp; sends a limo to the hotel to pick you up for dinner. Once you're in the limo, it becomes clear that it won't be taking you to the restaurant. If you're able to get out of the limo, are you able to work through the situation?

Long story short, you're bacially allowing someone you've never met to take your well being in his hands. If you for some reason decide this sounds like a fun adventure, do you have enough money &amp; know how to get yourself out of any bad situation? (And I don't mean ""the flattering older man says I'm so mature,"" I mean, would you know how to get out of a random bad neighborhood? Would you be able to book an emergency flight out? Would you be able to figure out transportation at the moment things might turn bad? Etc.)"
"It's not horrible to say to someone ""Hey, sorry but we're not in the mood for company right now. Please go home and we will catch up another time."" Just because she's got a disability doesn't mean everyone's obligated to spend time with her when they don't feel like it. They should treat her like anyone else who invites themselves over."
"That's kind of how it starts OP. A couple of comments which aren't *that* bad, then it's more regular. Then it escalates even more. I'm not saying it's time to ditch this ""friend"" but ..."
"It's okay for her to not only want an engagement ring, but to want to like it. It's a fairly big investment and one that she'll hopefully wear for the rest of her life. I think it's really great that OP understands that.

Besides, having a ring she likes shouldn't be conflated with a ring that ""shows off your richness"" or anything like that - it's more a matter of fitting into her personal aesthetic, which they can probably make happen at any price point. "
"Ask for the ring back and break the engagement. Her behaviour shows that she values material things over an emotional connection. Is that someone you really want to get married to? If it is, then return the ring and buy something more expensive. Then prepare to spend the rest of your life trying to buy her love. 

Or return the ring and pay back all the people you borrowed money from. Whatever you have left put it into savings or treat yourself to something nice. "
"THIS THIS THIS

There is no mystery here. You can't fix him. This is how he is. He's selfish and petty and mean to children. "
Did you miss the part where OP tried to convince this person to stay married until OP was convinced she had a good enough reason to divorce?
"&gt; If she's gonna cheat, she'll cheat. He needs to relax and trust her, or date a girl who doesn't want to party.

This. My high school boyfriend (boy, was he a winner!) introduced me to raves/dance music/etc. Towards the end when when he was on probation, he ""wouldn't let me"" go to raves without him because he was worried I'd cheat. 

Guess what OP. I never cheated. I went to a rave while he was in rehab, and didn't cheat. We broke up when he was out of rehab, and HE HAD CHEATED ON ME DURING HIS STAY. 

You're at 2 months. Go to the show. If he seriously can't handle it then break up with him and date someone who either attends events with you, or trusts you as a person and doesn't try to limit you like this. And I say this as someone who is NOW dating a metalhead (he doesn't like a majority of popular dance music) who doesn't give two shits about me going to see a dj I like with friends. "
How many months are required for you to acknowledge someone's parenthood? What's the magic number? 
"Everything you describe points to someone who is emotionally absent and disengaged. 

Everyone is different: to some people breaking a phone is a big-ish deal and upsetting (especially when you're already under financial strain around Christmas), to most people it'd be really upsetting to have introduced two friends, and for them to hit it off and start excluding you from activities that *you suggested*. I've been in similar situations and it really bloody hurts.

It sounds to me like any feelings/opinions you have that he doesn't relate to or agree with, he is uninterested in and unwilling to lend any emotional support or discuss it, and that you have to submit and accept that - because when you did raise an issue (with being called submissive), you were treated like your concerns were unreasonable and your attempts to discuss it were shut down (in a rather demeaning way, too).

These are serious issues. You should not have to modify your behaviour like this to placate him. Do not tolerate this kind of behaviour. "
"THIS! I wish I could up vote twice. Get him the same things so he could still be in his comfort zone and also throw in some new but similar clothing for a gradual change that he is comfortable with and go from there. Also, DO NOT throw away his clothes without his agreement, that never ends well.

"&gt;$10,000 for a ring is pushing any sort of common sense. $100,000 defies all reason.

Meh that also depends on your social circle. OP's Gf comes from a wealthy family so a big ass ring might be something one is required to have to live in that social environment without getting looked down upon (aka snobby rich people culture). She and OP might just be financially incompatible. For sure, if OP were poor they probably wouldn't even be in a relationship right now. The fact that she measures men's marriage-ability by how much money they make screams greed and a level of vapidness anyone would hesitate to hitch themselves to.

"Nope.  If he can afford to buy a new apartment before his current one sells, he can afford to refurbish it himself or do without.  There's no guarantee that his old apartment will sell in a reasonable amount of time and some feckless people in that situation might just walk away from the mortgage.   Just because you've save up some money doesn't mean assorted cousins can use you as an ATM.  If you don't feel strong enough to just say no, tell him the savings are wrapped in in an investment you can't get access to."

Attempts at financial support??  Or did you cease financial support when they refused to visit you (the person who betrayed their mother and destroyed their family)?   
"This is true. She admitted to a few of us at the party that both her and her fiance have been unfaithful in the past but said it was just the once for both of them. Does make you wonder what else could have gone on, I certainly don't just want to be another target as you put it."
"Well after the laptop breaks, then he laughs at the fact that he destroyed your property, then he refuses to fix the problem he caused, then he redirects the blame towards her. And that's how you go from a broken laptop to fucking dumping him."
"I hope one day you realize the truth of the matter here. Your marriage is clearly over. You need to accept that and start rebuilding your life without her instead of waiting for her to come back to you like a sad puppy. There's no ""Happily Ever After"" for you here. Accept it or don't. Totally your call. It's not going to change the fact that she's done. You probably did nothing wrong aside from marry young and marry military. It's a shitty situation, but you can't win a game you've already lost."
"The ring cost $300 and is not a diamond, so it's not your ""traditional"" engagement ring. As someone with a non traditional ring, I felt like everyone would judge me if I said it was an engagement ring, so perhaps he lied about it being for the middle finger. "
"You're right, her record states she can't be trusted. I'm sure that girl will come around but i'm definitely not a lady killer so it could take some time, even if I want a relationship any time after this. Thanks."

"It might not be wholly relevant to this thread, but as someone with BPD (Borderline, not Bipolar), the two are similar and the behavior described here seems more in line with BPD than BD. It can often be misdiagnosed as bipolar but bipolar mood swings are not nearly as sudden as BPD ones are. I only point this out in case OP might find this knowledge helpful in moving forward with treatment for his GF.

I might be off base, but it could be worth a look, because the described outbursts most certainly resonate with me, and I know it's common to miscategorize them as being bipolar when treatment for BPD would help. There's a lot of misinformation out there about BPD so check r/BPD and related subs for where to find actual information."
My friend puked in my car not too long ago but immediately bought cleaning supplies and cleaned it up. I wasn't mad at all albeit a bit disgusted. I would say don't beat yourself up about it. Puking is totally natural especially when you've had a bit too much to drink. The fact that it was in her bed was simply unfortunate. You consistently offered to make amends by paying for a cleaning service which is good on you but I would also reach out to her personally to apologize. That's all you can do on your end really to try and reconcile things with her. 
"Card is not a nice gesture. You are not sending a card because you want her to feel apriciatedeprived you are sending a card in order to remain her about your existence and desperate attempt to get her to be with you.

It's manipulative and sinks of desperation. Trust me if there is nothing more off putting than desperate man. She won't find your card nice she will find it annoying and creepy. Do yourself a favour and move on with your life because she did. "
"You're really young and this guy should more than have his shit together by mid-30s.  I don't know him, but here's something I know dirtbag guys do: they have a series of girlfriends and to keep everything simple and easy to manage, each girlfriend gets a specific day (or days) of the week, an activity (e.g. sportsball), and a type of cuisine (e.g. Japanese).  I'm not saying this is your situation, but reading it, that struck me as weird.

What do you want out of this relationship?  If you're content to date someone who sees you less than once a week, then okay.  Go with God.  If you're not (and if you're snooping on his friends' social media, I guess you're in this category), then tell him that things aren't working out.  No need to ask if he's still seeing his ex; he doesn't sound like the type to come clean anyway.  And get tested for STDs asap.

Sorry you're in a shitty situation.  You say you're terrible with communication, but you're really young and you learn a lot of this stuff in relationships.  But you have to be in a relationship where you feel valued and respected, and it doesn't seem like this relationship gives you that."
"Your ""youth"" should be about whatever you want it to be. You don't have to experience new relationships all the time. You can still experience friendships and meet new people while being in a lasting relationship.

The only thing I agree with you here is that if they break up, they should find somewhere else to live separately fast, because holy hell that would be awkward."
"I don't know what to tell you man, you almost gotta have the talk of being exclusive these days. 

Everybody is different, but this certainly seems like it has become the norm in the past 20 years or so. For both men and women.

"I guess I know so many men who worship their mothers and treat their SO badly and I have seen the other way around.

I do think OP should break up with her SO though. However, I would break up with him regardless if it was his mother, friend, father, or anybody else. I mean he even told OP that his mother should have asked his father to shovel the snow at four in the morning! It clearly isn't limited to his mom. 

Edit: I would talk to him first and see if I could get him to see that he was acting lazy/entitled/bossy/rude. If he couldn't see those things, then I would break up with him."

"My read on this is that your girlfriend either has some problems with empathy, or your disorder is making you waaaaaay harder to live with than you realize and some resentment she's been holding in slipped out with that remark. Maybe a little of both. "

"Don't dwell on feeling ashamed for your viewpoints.  Everyone gets their perspectives changed on something, unless you've actively caused emotional harm to someone with your attitude towards porn actresses in the past, this is just an eye opener for you. You're being incredibly introspective and it's very impressive.  Go hang out with your sister and ask about her life at college.  Focus on what she wants to share with you. Be supportive so if anything ever changes, she knows she has you in her corner."

"I'm not sure why you'd waste your time watching reality TV if you hated the stars or thought that people on reality tv shows were all stupid or otherwise less-than.

Crying is an involuntary biological reaction to stress, sadness or happiness. 

It's no more of a choice than sneezing, laughing or orgasm. "
"Little bit of a red flag about the lack of communication that's going on.  If you guys can't talk about stuff you might be moving towards doing, it's almost guaranteed that it's going to be more awkward if you actually do it.  Things work a lot better if you have a relationship where you can talk about what you're contemplating doing first.  (TBH I'd go so far as to say if you and she aren't comfortable talking about sex or other particular things, you should back off significantly, because it's a sign that what's happening in the moment may be more than she's comfortable with the rest of the time. Not necessarily, but the best way to eliminate that possibility is to talk about it.) 

Anyway, I'd work on communicating, and have a (clothes-on, but private -- maybe order in food) conversation about what everyone's limits are, and where things are going.  You may be surprised by how things go."

"It doesn't take a mind reader to know that bringing the present was the kind, courteous thing to do. And the guilt tripping was not appropriate. If she works nights and Christmas morning would have been a bad day for her, why wouldn't the mom have accommodated her the same way they did op? "
Why would you confront her about it? You missed your chance dude. Don't look at her snapchats if they make you uncomfortable. This is all too much drama for your age.

"I grew up with smokers. My mom smoked 2 packs a day. My dad nearly 3.  

So 5 packs a day in a 950 square foot home. I had bronchitis 2-3 times a year from the age of 12 until I moved out at 20. 

Soon as I moved our the bronchitis stopped. 

***TO THIS DAY*** my mother insists that the bronchitis was caused by some mysterious invisible mold in my room.

"He...sounds like a child. When you get better, you guys need to iron this shit out in marriage counseling or your marriage probably won't survive the first year with a baby. 

Having a baby is an incredible stressor on even a strong marriage. It sounds like you feel like you can't depend on him to do things right (and it sounds like he fucks things up on the regular) and it sounds like he finds you critical and ungrateful (I disagree but you're not married to me). This will not improve when you're caring for a small, screaming larval human on two hours sleep. Good luck and I hope you feel better soon. Pregnancy sucks. "
Exactly. The first thing I thought was what if I had ended up the convict and my brother ended up the college grad on the straight path. What would my dad say about me? I could only imagine. It could have easily went that way considering the environment I grew up in was much worse than the one my half-brother did having two parents and two incomes + the whole not having a father around to guide me. And my father obviously didn't give a flying shit considering he was basically absent in those crucial years from 14-18. Dude didn't even come to my HS graduation.
"This is just another classic case of an abuser trying to make sure that their side of the story is the only one people believe. By speaking at his funeral, she immediately becomes the poor, widowed fiancée and no one would suspect for a second that she had completely isolated your brother from the majority of the people in his life. She is also kissing up to your family because (depending on what state/country you live in), your family could potentially press charges if they have concrete evidence of her abuse. She's attempting to cover her ass and this behavior needs to be shut down immediately--to honor your brother's memory AND to prevent your family from becoming victims of her manipulation while you are all still so vulnerable."
"Not trying to knock on you because I don't know you but...maybe she is keeping them away from you until you are mature and respectful enough to want to parent them like an adult? That is my guess. That is why she maybe never told you -- maybe you are immature or something. Do you want to be a part of their lives instead of being pissed about it? I mean you have every right to be upset, but these are two small girls here and if you want to be a part of their lives time to get your shit together mentally, emotionally and all the other stuff.

Edit: I see I've touched a nerve? Heaven forbid I make a suggestion and further anger the OP. Its not a ""man"" thing, but instead of being upset maybe consider that someone might need to mature a little more, not a insane suggestion for a 22 yr old person. Not need to get y'alls panties in a bunch. "
sounds like you need new friends.  you could take them to small claims court for their portion of the fees.

"Jeez, that's frustrating. So unless someone sees that you're instantaneously attracted to them, they'll move on? Wow we base our relationships on some pretty stupid stuff."
"I don't know whether the baby will be cold or not.

But I can guarantee you that the baby and the mother will not have any fun at a drunken party in the middle of the bloody night!

If you think that you WILL have fun, what the hell have you been doing for the last month? Because if you had been taking care of your girlfriend and child, or even if you *merely* been doing half the baby care while letting the mother deal with her own recovery, you wouldn't think you'd be able to have fun at a midnight party with your baby there.

If you want to show off your child and your parenting skills to your friends, do it at a reasonable time of day and don't require the *still recovering* mother to come along and do all the actual parenting work. And stay sober while doing it.
"
"I agree.



OP, you think the problem is that you're ""so intellectual,"" but you're actually ""just an asshole."" I'm assuming you see her arguments as dumb and vague.... when in reality, you're discussing something she thinks is fucking boring, lol. Maybe you should look inward and try to be a more understanding partner before you get into a relationship.


Finally, it's a bit ironic that your writing style is certifiable shit, yet you're trying to identify as a ""sapiosexual."" Get off the hype train. You aren't a sapiosexual, and you aren't all that intelligent. You're just arrogant."
"Didn't even read past ""I also have a roommate."" 

Truthfully, ""I'm just not comfortable with it"" should be reason enough, but I would be pissed if my NYC roommate allowed her sister to fuck a stranger in my home. Tell her it's not okay with your roommate. Case closed.

If you trust your sister you could consider allowing her to stay in your apartment under the condition that sex takes place in her boytoy's apt/hotel."
"There is a reason that a someone his age has pursued to have a relationship with someone so much younger than him.

Usually it is because women his own age will not put up with his immaturity. (Being childlike or childish over something you love is something completely different. I am 30 yo and I absolutely love game merch, that is being childish, having an affair and then trying to dump the blame (""you did not suck my dick often enough, what was I supposed to do"") is immature)

Ghost away. Block him every which way and never look back. "
That's lovely. My dad's the same. For the last few years I've taken him to the pub for his birthday and played some pool because it's so much more meaningful than a present that he doesn't really want.
"What about gay men? Are they not allowed to have male friends while they're in relationships, or is this just a straight guy thing? What about bisexuals - are they allowed to have friends at all? "
"You don't love her so break up. You are not required to make the break up as devastating as possible. 

Let her down as gently as possible while making it clear that it is over forever. If you keep her on the back burner 'just in case' then you are a scumbag. "
"He's allowed to be picky. It sounds like he was indeed grateful to the people who got him the gifts but doesn't actually like the gifts themselves. I've had this happen a lot - I mention I've always wanted something and someone gets me something similar. Yes it's a very nice gesture but I'm still disappointed because I wanted to pick out *exactly* what I wanted.


I think a lot of it depends on how he was voicing all this to OP. If he was actually complaining a lot, then yes I'd agree he's ungrateful. But if OP was like ""how'd you like all the stuff?!"" and he mentioned he wasny crazy about them, I think that's perfectly valid."
"Thanks for this. 
He was definitely very stressed about all this. He's really not used to big family and even less to be at the center of the attention (he's kind of the scapegoat of his family). 
He also very rarely get that many gifts and had told me before that he didn't like Christmas because his parents would never get him something personalised and were always super cheap with gifts to him. 

This is definitely something I need to discuss with him to try to understand how he feels and why he thinks all these gifts are now useless. 
"
"Another thing you can do is watch a video about how to play the game in advance. For any board game there are a bunch of ""how to play"" videos on YouTube, that clearly explain everything in a pretty short amount of time. I find these useful when I get a new game, because I hate reading rulebooks. If you know you're going to play a game, you can watch the video by yourself beforehand. 

You can also ask to be on a ""team"" with your boyfriend the first time. This means you get to be a part of the game and learn how to play without having to worry about not fully grasping the rules. "
"Well some fetishes aren't very healthy in real life, so you pick a partner who is healthy and make your fetish second priority to a good relationship. Anything else you can get from porn or act it out as closely as you can. That's just my two cents. "

Respect his wishes, don't be the crazy ex girlfriend, and move on. "
"I don't play into people's ""Read My Mind"" games. 

They can either talk to me like an adult, or I will act as if everything is fine. They can shoot me dirty looks, slam doors, play the silent treatment game - and I will be my happy, cheerful self. I will wish them a good morning, I will wave to them as I pass them in the hall, I will smile to them, I will say hi and sit in the living room on the couch. 

They can storm off in a huff, they can do whatever they want. But unless they come to me and say ""I really need to talk to you about something,"" I assume all is fine, because I am NOT a mind reader. And I do NOT engage in games. I am not going to chase after someone saying ""What's wrong? What did I do? Are you mad? Why won't you talk to me?"" Nope. I am just my happy self. And if it drives them out of their skull with resentment, that's fine, I don't care. They can't bring me down. Maybe they'll approach me like an adult. 
 
In the meantime, you do you. She will learn that food costs money and she has to buy it herself. You can point to the lease and note that it does NOT include food, meals or rides. You can also note that rides to town will cost $xx.xx dollars per round trip, due to gas costs. 

She has disposable income - she will need to learn to manage her money. It's not your job to teach her. "
":( The amount of times I've been referred to as a fuck toy or some kind of inanimate object to be used is really eye-opening. 

I have a lot of regret for trying to do anything in the first place. I bake a lot because it got me through my own parents dying. I was trying to extend some kindness to his mom who just went through the same loss and it ended up horribly, much like me making a post on the internet."
"It's the wrong message, if you go to him now it will show him that he can control you i this way.

it's not healthy for either of you. "
"Lmao, chill. I'm assuming OP's boyfriend did this while they were together otherwise she wouldn't have posted here.

/u/audgedawg, can you confirm?"
"so if he's so shitty and rapey, why do you care about his feelings and whether or not he has friends "
"You worry about the welfare of you and her, not him.

Harassment is harassment. He's not ""ill"" he is an asshole. This is a Police job. "
I don't know what facebook you're looking at but it's still an option for me.
"Yup, you are 100% in the wrong here. If you want to be this paranoid then keep your valuables in your room and lock it. But don't be this paranoid because you are kind of an asshole."
There's no way he could have known she would wake up when he left. He literally left her for dead. OP needs to call the police.
"this is all very true and you are very correct. the only male influence i had growing up was my grandfather, and he just passed a few weeks ago. i think all of this devastation and grief is clouding my decision making process to a dangerous degree. i really appreciate you taking the time to look past what i've said on the surface and dig a little deeper. thank you so, so much. i will take your advice, and i will seek help. i see my doctor tomorrow, so that's where i'll start.

And that makes him a bad guy???
"this seems like a pretty reasonable request, considering you're at her house. 

don't set off the fireworks. go somewhere else and set them off, or set them off at a time when her son is not sleeping."
"Sorry buddy.

You've left out why she isn't attracted to you.

The way forward to salvage your marriage lies in why. Let us know why and maybe the advice will be more specific to you rather than just generic statements."
"So his feelings are important, but yours are not, right?  He should feel free to vent his feelings at you, but you should not feel free to react or be hurt in any way?

Honey, that's the definition of emotional abuse.  You deserve better. "
Because she doesn't want kids..?
"So basically you tried to spook him into trying to hang on to you by saying you were breaking things off; however, instead of clinging to you and the relationship, he blew you off. This is a good example of why you don't say you're breaking up with someone unless you are genuinely prepared to carry through with it. You did this to yourself, and now you need to deal with the bitter results.

That said, he sounds pretty miserable to deal with, and you said you've been unhappy and thinking about breaking up for a while, so it sounds like it's for the best. Get a hotel room for tonight and call your support system for help and ideas. Get your plans for moving out in the next few days firmed up, text details to your now-ex, and get it done. Don't drag this out, just move on and do your best to learn from the situation. "
"I think you're just going to have to be brutally honest with her.  Let her know asap that the guest house is for her, and her alone, and that in your opinion Gary is a controlling misogynistic racist, and is not welcome.

It may end the friendship, or it may be the catalyst to help her move on from him.  Maybe some day she will realize you were trying to help her get out of a shitty relationship."
What are the reasons your boyfriend doesnt want to propose? 
Have you heard of Google? 
"While I completely agree that the person may well have been harmless, do you not think that avoiding someone who is anxious and overwhelmed is likely a good response? I know when I'm overwhelmed the fewer people around the better.

And along with all the other ""not all __ are dangerous"", when the stakes are high it's not worth taking the chance just to avoid hurting a stranger's feelings."
This is an extreme and irrational reaction. Can you talk to your dad even if he's out of town? What other crazy things has your stepmom done?

"Actually she hasn't. Other people have and all she knows is what they told her. There was no reason for OP and siblings not to have called the police, if for nothing else the car accident/drunk driving for insurance purposes if not for moral reasons. To not call for the assault on top of that is nuts."
"I tend to find I'm correct most of the time. Happy to be proven wrong though, if OP cares to update in the future."
"Yeah this. If you don't get involved at this point, at least some of the blood will be on your hands. Bystanders have power. Doing nothing is doing alot in itself. It's making a choice to roll the dice and let that person continue to suffer"
Sure... But sometimes it helps to fake it til you make it. 
In the future do not have a joint account with someone who is not a spouse. You need to exit this relationship. Call her family so they know but get your stuff out.
"OP are you sure he's not smoking synthetic weed 'Spice', I've heard that smoking it and substances like it can give that effect?"
"I remember reading an essay written by a girl whose relationship sounded just like yours. He ended up shooting her in the face. Please get out of there and don't let him find you or your dogs, he is going to kill you. 

Edit: Do not break up with him in person, just LEAVE."
Adding to this: double-check your local renters' rights before evicting him. You don't want the jerk to be able to come back and smack you with the legal hammer for an improper eviction on top of everything else.
"even conservative parents have a sexuality, dude. i mean, he had to fuck someone to create you."
"I have to wonder if he is crazy oblivious or planning a new year's proposal? 
Now that you know how you feel about this, I would plan to have a conversation about how this made you realize you wanted there to be a proposal.  "
"&gt; Also contributing to my feelings, is that I don't really have any friends. Especially not any that care about me like boyfriend's buddies do him.

Do you have any activities that you could meet people through? The insecurities with the abusive ex and wanting to feel emotionally close will take time and effort, but are things you can work on yourself. Getting friends or at least people who you can feel comfortable around and have fun with will require some initiative. Do you have any ways of meeting a lot of different people? "

Nobody wins when you hold stuff like this over each other."
"The waffling back and forth is odd...

But while it may not feel like it to you, 15 and 18 are light years apart in terms of development and maturity. When I was 18 I wouldn't have touched someone 15. Wayyyyy too far behind me developmentally. I think that while it's tough it may be time to move on. Long distance is a killer even in long-term relationships. It's a death sentence to almost every relationship. I promise you there are other boys out there better for you and closer in age."
"I'm so sorry to hear that. The reason why I'm saying ""I'm sorry"" instead of ""I'm happy for you"" is because when someone that much older than you shows an interest in someone so much younger than he is, at your respective ages, it almost always means he's looking for someone to control.

I mean this as gently as I possibly can say it, but when people like him go for people like you, the ""he's nice and makes you happy"" part is the tasty worm on the hook. Next comes the part where he yanks it through your cheek and doesn't let go."
"Some mixed stuff here. Being on your phone and Facebook is appropriate when someone is in and out of consciousness. It's your physical presence that is important. 

Other than that, I would be pissed too. You told him he didn't have to but he did anyway and was immediately unhappy. Id break up with him now so he can't get out of the lease and saddle you with it. 

I would be so pissed off about the 'helping' thing. Some people love to frame choices they made like this so they can't admit they just make bad choices. You told him he could be unhappy and he did it anyway. That's his choice."
"I've come here with an open mind and I am asking for help to understand this situation and learn from it. A comment like yours, which reprimands me but does not offer any insight doesn't help me to learn from this situation.

I suggest that you try a different approach in the future if you want to help change people's perceptions."
"So 5 year olds don't deserve respect? You shouldn't have said anything to begin with, but if you just had to say something, you could have said it nicer. ""Hey Kate, I'm worried you're going to get hurt running around with all these hot dishes! Could you take the dog outside and play?"" 

Even though it's STILL not your place to tell the kid where to go/what to do. It's the mom's. You shouldn't have said anything, and you especially shouldn't have been so rude about it."

I hate that it's taken me so long to get to this point. I'll be looking into getting therapy when I return home. 

Thanks for the commiseration. "

"It sounds like you are jealous of your brother because he gets to go to a fancy boarding school?

Anyways, you are both your parents' children and your brother is merely 17 years old. By law, your parents are obligated to take care of him until he is 18. You are 18 already though, so if you want to, you can obtain a job, work, and move out.

It also sounds like your brother doesn't like to talk to you or interact with you. I think you should leave him alone and not bother him? If he's watching anime porn as you say, then he is likely doing that in the privacy of his own room. Are you entering his room without permission? I think you should leave your brother alone.

It sounds like you don't like him and it also sounds like he doesn't care much for you either."

Just as your mother shouldn't and can't be trying to save people, neither should you. You can be honest, but if people don't want to accept that, take care of yourself and don't keep pushing. Be choosy about whom you spend time with. "

It's something you may want to discuss with him to get an idea of what his expectations are after marriage, or if you guys have kids, etc. Hell, things like vows! Talk to him about this, OP - there's a reason it's bothering you. "

"Honestly. You did nothing wrong. She was talking very flippantly about it and you asked a well intentioned question. There was no way you could have known it would back fire.

"How many years were you a troubled teen? 

They say sins of the father last 7 generations. I disagree with all the posters that say she should totally be over it by now. Things that happen in childhood create strong tattoos on the mind. This will likely be a lifelong issue for her, and if you want to be a good sibling, you should probably accept that. 

My husband still will not step into a church at age 30, after his parents repeatedly tried to treat his mental illness with exorcism. He loves his parents and understands they were ignorant and doing their best, but no sane person would tell him to ""just get over it and be a church going christian already, it has been 20 years ugh."" 

You want her to get over it because it affects you. But she isnt having a great time either. If she could hit a button and make it all better she likely would. 

There is no right answer to how to approach this, but acting like she is a nuissance is exactly how you got here."

So in a sense you have invited the company into your personal life.  You could try talking to HR to see if you have options but both HR and managers have a responsibility to do what they believe is best for the company.  For what it's worth I agree your manager is overreacting, it sounds like maybe they have had a negative experience with workplace relationships before.  I don't have more solid advice unfortunately, it sounds like you may have to take this one on the chin and either deal with the wonky hours or look for employment elsewhere."

They talk at least once a week and like to go hunting/fishing/to the movies and stuff together pretty regularly, so I am shocked that he would do something that he knew would hurt his son. Before me, I know my bf had a long-termish partner that both his parents liked and they still mention occasionally. I probably should have put that in there....

At 29 you should know by now that requests like this are impossible. People don't change unless they want to. The requests you boyfriend is making indicates that he is a very selfish person, and is therefore even less likely to change than the average person could.

You sound like you're taking this all very lightly, but this is a very serious deal breaker for 99% of the population. He does not give a single shit about your feelings, why are you still with him?

"The best advice I can give for you is to just chill. You sound pretty full of yourself--less ""boring"" or ""nice"" than arrogant. If you don't want to drink, sleep around, etc., that's great. If you do want to drink, sleep around, etc., that's fine, too. You are not superior to everyone else your age just because of these decisions. (And plenty of other 18 year olds don't party.) A real gentleman doesn't get pleasure out of looking down on others. Also, be careful of making sweeping declarative statements about how you plan to live your life. You may find in a few years that you do like to drink and smoke weed. That's fine, too.

And cool it with quoting Nietzsche. It doesn't make you look as smart as you think. "
"Mate, I have some sympathy for you over the nitpicking thing. I saw my sister do that with her husband. Mind you, it was stemming from some resentment she held over him going out drinking to celebrate the baby rather than being there with her after the birth. 

You guys should sit down and talk about this issue when you're both calm. Not at the time she nitpicks but at a neutral time. Tell her you want to be involved, that you may make some mistakes, you both will, but you'd like the two of you to learn and improve together in a supportive way and while maintaining your humour and love and respect for one another. "
"Yeah, I used to be like this. I love interior design, and I was super controlling about it (not to the point that I'd care if my husband decorated an extra room for himself, but we've never had the luxury of having one yet unfortunately). 

Then one day I noticed he put some new figurines of his on our bookshelf, and I picked them up to put them away somewhere when I suddenly stopped short and thought ""What the fuck am I doing? It makes him happy to have these out, and it's his space too. Why am I being mean to him by not allowing him to have some control over his living space?""

I felt awful. He never complained about it, but ever since then I've made sure he has an equal say about any decor. I hope OP's wife has the same realization, because in the future when she learns not to give a fuck so much about mundane things, she's going to feel really guilty over it."

"Bullshit. Being in crowd and hanging out with random people is not how you cure anxiety. 

I used to suffer from anxiety - panic attacks whenever I had to call someone etc, now I'm working with people with mental health issues. If you really have anxiety you have to firstly acknowledge you need help and get it. A good therapist will help you manage that or even 'cure' it. 

Many people tend to downplay mental health issues aka 'stop being depressed!'. OPs gf is simply too comfortable to work, that's what you get when you are 29 and marry a 19 y/o teenager."
"Possibly the only decent advice you've got imo. Better than half the other replies that said little more than ""a woman can do whatever she likes without being judged"", which is pretty much what you said in the post. You were just unsure if what she did meant that she wasn't interested in you."
"You need to go a good long time without drinking at all. You clearly did not handle it well in terms of pacing yourself, you overdid it, and it turns out you are an aggressive asshole when drunk. You may be the type of person who should _never_ drink if you want to maintain your relationships since you evidently turn abusive when drunk, or at least when you are THAT drunk, hence my suggestion to not drink for a long time. 

Staying sober and showing her what matters to you are what you can do to earn her trust back. Eventually, after several months most likely, you may be able to start drinking again (in moderation). Discuss it with her first and tell her you want to develop the ability to moderate yourself. But if you overdo it again or ever enter the state that you did that night, you are really putting yourself into tremendous physical danger not to mention setting yourself up to be very lonely."

"I frown on suicide *threats* too, but it's just not true that genuinely suicidal people never *talk* about suicidal ideation. In fact studies have found that over 90% of people who have died by suicide communicated their plans to at least one other person in the time period leading up to the attempt. Even people who use the threat of suicide for attention are still more likely to die by suicide than someone who never expresses the desire to kill themselves at all.

This is a dangerous suicide myth that encourages people to ignore those who are at real risk. "

&gt; Keeping an ex in your life doesn't scream ""moving forward."" It screams ""need for attention,"" it screams ""lack of respect for your partner,"" it screams ""potentially bad situation"" 

That's ridiculous. Plenty of adults can keep up friendships with past partners. It's immature to assume that being able to be civil, friendly, kind, etc, to people from your past means that you lack respect or need attention. It is meaningless to judge someone based on the fact that they are able to hold and maintain friendships. 

&gt;Or it is a huge sign that I have respect enough for my self not to want to compete with an EX

This is truly bizarre. Every past partner is not a competition for the current one. That is truly an unhealthy viewpoint that stems purely from insecurity. 

&gt;Why should I have boundaries if a GF doesn't? 

That makes no sense. If the past partner is an a friendly level only, that is a hard boundary. And a reasonable boundary. 

&gt;Also please answer this: do your parents or grand parents hang out with their ex's... Why do you think that is? 

Yes, actually, they do. Well, my parents do. One side of my grandparents only ever dated each other, and the others have moved away from their home state, so I doubt they would be able to hang out with anyone from their past.

&gt;Don't you think those values are part of the reason marriages actually lasted

Plenty of happily married people hang out with people from their past and have solid marriages. Banning people from the past just because they are from the past -with no actual boundaries being crossed and no one doing anything out of line- isn't a ""value"". It's of  rather over the top possessiveness. 

&gt;There are thousands of girls not living with an ex.. I'll date one of them.

Sure, go do that. But it's nonsense to think you have the right to boot people from their lives and claim it is your ""values"" and that not doing so means they have no boundaries. 

&gt;I am judging her for putting herself in this situation. It is the same difference as dating someone you work with... A no no.

Consenting adults can do as they wish. Because they are consenting adults. Judging someone for having consensual, single person sex with another single adult is nonsense. 

&gt;Or he can ya know... make his own decision instead of you trying to shame him into being OK with this.

Shame and realistic thinking are different things. 

&gt;That is my (and his) choice, and we can use whatever criteria we want in determining who we date.

Fair enough.

"Go no contact. There is no way around that. You might also want to look into therapy for yourself and work on your self-esteem.

"Ah. See, me and my boyfriend had issues with his libido once before while he was very depressed and starting a new medication. When he experiences low libido, it's extremely difficult for him to get a boner/be turned on. So I thought the same is applicable to all guys lol!

It sounds like it's just her kind of blowing her lid from multiple occasions of being turned down. Which, again, I can understand her frustration lol!"
"I think it's a ""slippery slope"" thing. This is probably a situation where the brother has repeatedly hurt the family &amp; broken trust. He's stolen from &amp; lied to the family. The only way to avoid getting sucked back into the cycle is to draw a hard line that the brother will not receive help no matter the circumstances. Husband is probably looking at this as his life with his wife &amp; children is off limits, &amp; he doesn't want his brother to think that avenue of help is available. Husband probably feels he is protecting his family from the same repeated lying &amp; stealing he's experienced by absolutely not allowing the brother in. "
"Don't date people who think it's unreasonable to fall asleep at 4 am. 
Don't make promises you can't keep.

Don't try to appease people who make unreasonable and nasty demands of you.

Your girlfriend is being completely ridiculous, but if she wants to break up over this, probably best to let her. If she decides not to dump you, tell her very clearly that she is the one who fucked up. You did your best, and were exhausted, and she's being petty and nasty to not be understanding of that. You'll keep on doing your best to say goodnight clearly, but she needs to practice more empathy and respect and let you get some damn sleep without having you beg her permission first.

Holding her boyfriend hostage to a texting conversation at 4 am is actually way shitter than her boyfriend not saying goodnight in precisely the way she wants him too."

Just looked that up - that is both the weirdest and the coolest ceiling 'decoration' I've ever seen.
Every time I hear stories like this on this subreddit it always reminds me of the character in the series Lost where the guy's father reconnected with him because he needed a kidney.
That is absolutely incorrect. There are plenty of specialized careers where two bachelors degrees are relevant and useful.
"This is likely because he is pretty relaxed in general fiscally, especially when it comes to her. He sounds somewhat financially stable, which means he probably pays for all meals, outings, etc.

I can understand the situation, and it's complicated. When I was in college, I was more ""well off"" than other kids. When I went on dates, trips, and such, I paid for everything, even gas if we used my dates' car. It wasn't just because I was being nice or anything. Part of it was because I just wanted to do those things, and if I wanted my date to go, unfortunately/fortunately/whatever I just considers that was ""just the cost of business."" Whenever I was somewhat serious with someone and spent nights at their place, and whenever we'd do joint groceries, I even paid for the groceries just because I reasoned I'd benefit from it too.

It can be embarrassing to ask for something when common practice dictates you're lax on that sort of thing. The difference here is he wasn't willing and knowledgeable of it. Still, it can be awkward.

I remember one time my girlfriend borrowed my car for an out of town trip with her friends. I got the car back and it was dirty, like crumbles and trash everywhere. I was so mad. A dirty car is just an especially big pet peeve of mine. It's common habit for me to look for and grab ALL garbage EVERYTIME I get out of my car. There's a local car wash that does an awesome job, basically detailing level interior/exterior work for $22... chump change... but yeah. As mad as I was, it was still a bit awkward asking her to pay for it, and I only felt like she had to pay for it to punish her/teach her a lesson in how bad that pissed me off."

Keep that in mind and stay safe OP. Then, talk to your dad about some therapy for your mom and the rest of the family. Make sure to phrase it as a way of dealing with your toxic grandma, not that there's a problem with your mom.

And again, remember: NO is the magic word."
"&gt; I think it's ignorant to judge someone's future relationship worth based on their relationship with their parents.

It isn't. It's an important factor. If there are solid reasons for the behavior, such as having parents that were abusive, that is one thing.

But watching the son be lazy and entitled while his mother, who clearly cares for him, breaks her back to get things done (after a full day of working, mind you), can tell you a lot about how he will treat his wife.

"Surely the life you picture with her does not involve knock-down drag-out fights, literal physical fights that leave one or both of you injured. My point is that you are hanging onto a dream that cannot be achieved. 

If you cannot or will not go to counseling, you need to recognize that you are bad for each other. If you had the capacity to have a disagreement without it turning physical, you'd already be doing it. No good is going to come of staying together - at one point or another someone will get hurt or arrested or get into some other type of trouble with neighbors/landlords/bosses due to domestic violence. 

Please walk away from this relationship. Do not get into another one until you've had some time to think about what brought you to the point of hitting. She should of course do the exact same. Eventually if you can afford therapy, you should prioritize getting yourself some."
"I agree. I am straight, very much in love with my SO and I would not be opposed to having a 3 some in the future with a female. Just because she wants to explore sexually doesn't mean your life together is crumbling. She trusts and loves you so much that she feels comfortable telling you this. "

"I'm in a similar family and even though I don't like christmas much, I asked my dad months beforehand to fill out an amazon wish list that I could share with our immediate family. In prior years I just didn't know what to get him because of his laid back introverted sort of personality. Christmas morning this year he came down wearing the ""feel the Bern"" christmas sweater I got him last year which made me grin from ear to ear. I told him I got him all the books on his kindle wishlist. He gave me Bernie Sander's new book. He even got the tire pump he wanted from my brother. There have been christmases in the past where he didn't get anything from my brother.

I also took him to lunch the day before christmas just because I hadn't spent much one-on-one time with him recently. I'm sure your dad would appreciate that more than a gift."
"&gt;However, he refuses to change himself. I think this is because he can't accept that he's not that smart. Trying to improve himself would imply that his current self isn't already perfect.

That's not being ""emotionally unintelligent"", that's straight-up being an asshole.  A person who simply had a mental disorder that kept them from understanding emotions ""normally"" can learn - and usually do learn - if not fully how to process emotions and understand them, then at least how to not hurt other people's feelings.

Your dad is not that person.  He may have a social problem, but mostly he's an asshole.

You can help by not trying to ""make your family happy again"" because your family was *never* happy.  It sounds like your mother was always miserable, she just felt trapped by her culture, poverty, and her children.  You can help by supporting your mother in whatever decision she wants to take, and cut out the idea that your parents need to stay in this miserable wreck of a marriage just for you kids.  "

From his perspective (there are two sides to every story after all), he may think he's made himself clear about how he dislikes Christmas and that you are blatantly ignoring that because it goes against what you want to do, or rather how you want him to be.

My fiance and I swap Thanksgiving and Christmas each year, one at each of our family's homes. My parents are divorced so sometimes that requires more than one visit. Last year for Christmas my sister flew into town and my mother drove over for a few days for the holidays. So they were staying with us (aka no escape). Well my fiance and I got in a big fight because I felt like he was being less than Mr. Holly Jolly. I too love Christmas, he's sort of meh about it. Well he explained to me that he is not Mr. Social and that he finds holiday gatherings taxing on him, especially when it's 'my' family who he may not have anything in common with and he finds himself just sort of sitting watching us having a good time. After getting over my anger I realized that yeah, it might be annoying having to spend extended periods of time with people you don't know that well and that you may not like (my mother is an acquired taste and even I can only take her in small doses). 

But we talked about it. He explained himself and I get it. He did not yell at anyone though, he was just sort of was quiet and moody. You need to figure out what his problem is and try to see if you can understand it. Maybe for him, Christmas is more about time off from work and all he wanted to do was spend it with you. What did he get? A 10 hour car drive to go stay in what I am picturing as the beginning of Home Alone. If you're really ready to call it quits over this, then maybe you need to assess how you really feel about your fiance..."
"Agreed! People are addressing the family part, which is definitely important. But he also didn't get a thing he wanted, and then rather than conveying that with his words, was a jerk. That's a character flaw even aside from the family issues. OP, does he usually behave like this? Or is it an aberration?"
"As someone who had legal arrangements like that at 17 and 18 with older men, I can safely say that's almost worse. What that teaches young women is that they are valuable mainly for their bodies and being dumped after asking for a real emotional connection only reinforces that. I'm sure there's some exceptions to the rule out there, but this is unhealthy the vast majority of the time. If you're well out of your teens, you shouldn't be fucking teenagers at all."
"It actually sounds like he didn't know, and was trying to do something to show respect to her dad, and possibly use it as a way to bring them closer. 

For the record, I didn't ask my (ex)wife's dad, but as a dad myself now, I understand the dilemma. And because of that, I know how to handle it respectfully and graciously. IMO, neither OP or her dad handled this well. They both made him feel like a POS when all he was doing was trying to be respectful to the person that obviously matters most in her life. "
"&gt; Now failure creeps up on me every time I start feeling good about myself. 

Um, no. Every time you tried to make step forward, he gets furious, and you back down. Do you see that? Every time you are at the point of advancing yourself (new good job. finals. Europe) and growing into a successful, independent person, he threw a hissy fit an you capitulated to appease him. 

Anyone that can only be happy with you if you do not grow or change is not someone you should be with. He is threatened by you, because he knows you are smarter and will be more successful, and the way that he deals with his own insecurity is by trying to hold you down at his level.

Stop letting him do that. Be successful. Be great. Be brave. You are all those things. He's just not letting you be. "

"Hey, no matter how things turn out, I recommend you get some counseling.  You seem to have some issues with insecurity and jealousy towards your sister that you should hash out."
"is it possible to report this above A?

because you're new, this is tricky, but thats probably why she has targetted you."
"&gt; **She eventually told me she was sexually attracted to him, and asked me for a ‘pass’ to have sex with him.** I was okay with this, and said as much, though they never went through with it due to some condition the guy has. It passed, and they decided to take the sex off the table because of the condition and because of **their friendship deepening to the point where they felt that was more important than the physical aspect.**

Huh, am I reading this right? Your wife literally asked you if she could have sex with her ""friend""?

&gt; What do I do now? I know that if I call her and text her and beg her to take me back, she’ll just get annoyed that she’s being pressured into making a decision, and will just say ‘we’re done’ reflexively. 

Your wife's relationship with her ""friend"" completely progressed from friendship or a ""purely sexual relationship"" into an affair. Put an end to this or she will continue to essentially control your entire marriage. You don't deserve this kind of treatment, she's going back and forth and you are ~~kind of~~ letting her. Please move on and find someone who won't take advantage of you the way she does. "
"&gt;Normally my girlfriend and I can resolve conflicts easily with either one of us realizing we were being irrational.

You can have an argument and not resolve it with both and neither being irrational. 

Please in the future and with this one ignore 'Right' and 'Wrong' they are unhelpful concepts within a relationship.

I will try to explain how myself and my partner would have dealt with your current situation.

I will use the nicknames other's have.

Shoes/Sleepy 

'Shall we spend the night at Shoes' place? 

'Sure, but we need to remember that Shoes' stuff is at Sleepy's place.

'Point, do we deal with that now or in the morning?

'Ahh Fk it, we'll sort it in the morning. Shoes' starts work at what 1pm? 


Can you see where I am going with this?

COMMUNICATE

Describe what you are thinking, what you are feeling, what you want to have happen. 

Don't accuse, don't try to be right, don't try to prove each other wrong. 

Winning an argument in a relationship isn't winning, if you keep it up for too long you will win nothing and lose the relationship."
"I think that's the messed up part. She not only didn't offer an invite, but had every intention to hide it as well.


My husband and I are both homebodies as well. I'd be lying if I hadn't ""ditched"" him a few times in our dating years to go out with friends. I say this meaning that he was ALWAYS welcome to come, but he would tend to either come along and pout or stay home and watch movies. He's happy to stay home, and that's fine. Sometimes I don't want to be around him and his friends, either. We're always *invited* though.



I just think it's pretty messed up to just ditch you on NYE. At least if you knew and didn't want to go, you guys could have planned something... ffs, you already HAD plans!"

"If part of your desire for an engagement is family pressure, that is the WRONG reason, and all the more reason to wait. You are too easily pressured by family. You should wait until you have the strength and maturity to be able to stand up to family and say ""Nope. We're doing this on our timeline."" Family pressure is a big deal and can interfere with many marriages. Once you get married, your family will pressure you to have kids right away. What if they pressure you to spend every holiday with them, or pressure you to name the kids something, or whatever. The point is, as an adult, and as a spouse, you BREAK AWAY from those family pressures and become your own person. If you're not quite there yet, that's okay. You're young. But family pressure is NEVER a reason to make a huge life-change. Never. 
 
Same with anxiety. Anxiety is treated as a mental illness. It is not a good basis for making big decisions. ""I got engaged because I was really anxious about not being engaged!"" That's...not smart. Get therapy for your anxiety. 

""People in this area always get married young! All my friends are getting engaged and married."" Again, terrible reasons for engagement. 

You need to step back. Now is not the time, and your bf is telling you so. "
"&gt; Maybe he should start studying out of the house? I know I would go nuts if I had to stay indoors all day.

But if they have the option, maybe there's a way to build some sort of outdoor space for the cat to mitigate the meowing at the litter box behavior."

I am sending you a hug because that shit is scary to live through.  Next time, please call the police and take care of you and your sister."
"read this as ""A bigger cat"" instead of car

"You tell him every time never to do that. Do you see the problem here? You can't say never if you don't follow through and establish boundaries. 

He will keep doing this until he gets his way and you live somewhere you hate. Get out of this relationship."
"Oh yeah I wasn't trying to negate your more open-ended idea, just reinforce the ""slept together"" one. "

"It's also very possible that he's met someone in real life.
It doesn't take a lot of effort to text someone when you're into them, even if it's just to say ""I'm really swamped right now, but I'm thinking of you or I miss you.""

"You need to stop joking about your religion or lack thereof. You're throwing it in their faces. They're obviously not really cool about it, so instead of going on and on about it you need to just shush.

Make sure you get all your stuff out. It's not s negotiation. Tell her you are done. Good luck.

"I dont get it. Is it at 1 and then everyone just leaves?  And you wont see anyone for Christmas?

It just sounds like a hassle to move the times.  If you are looking for a reason or justification to be upset, I would just stop looking.  Just let it go and hope next year is better.  No use making a negative situation out of it, though I know it is probably sad for you :("
"Every roommate I ever had, we had the agreement that SO's can only stay over 3 days out of the week, and never when the person isn't around. So if he isn't there, she shouldn't be either.

"You need a new therapist. 

And one where you see the therapist separately, and then together. 

Immediately, I get that you need a vacation, so take one, by yourself or with some/all of the kids.  Imagine money is tight, but if you could even stay at a nearby days inn for one night, it is so relaxing!!! (I did this once, and it was the break that I needed)

hang in there, hope you feel better."
"why is what?  why are you being treated as a unit?  because you are one.  why do i think it's ridiculous to exchange gifts?  because you're an adult. if you want something for yourself you should just get it.  once you're past a certain age, unless it is with family or significant others, i think exchanging gifts is a waste.  "
"I jerk off in all kids of weird places because when I get horny I can't focus on what's in front of me. But I do it privately, and discreetly, and as fast as possible. 

Edit: KINDS not kids. Oh god I'm on a list now..."
Adults should not be asking kids to fetch them alcohol. Shame on your boyfriend. Maybe he can pass a cigarette too.
"Okay, I'm going to go against the general advice here. I think that boundaries are important in relationships, and that there needs to be a balance between your girlfriend and your friends. Right now it seems like you feel like hes choosing her over you ( like with the phone call thing) and that's not okay. So time for some ground rules maybe? I don't see your phone rule as controlling, personally. I think it's rude if someone cuts me off to talk to someone else ( given it's not an emergency!) -- unless weve been talking for hours, then that's different. But why can't they wait the few minutes for us to finish up and then call the other person back?? 

You can't control whether he is friends with her or not,And I don't here you saying you don't want him to be friends with her. What I hear  you saying is that he seems to have an usually close Friendship--with all his friends---and that it makes you feel uncomfortable and less important.  I agree it is unusual to talk to your friends on the phone everyday! If he refuses to change then you have to accept this is how he acts with his friends and decided whether that is something you want to live with or not. If he is willing to change, then time for boundaries! The phone thing is one example. Maybe another one is if you are spending time together, he doesn't answer his phone except for emergencies. Maybe you ask him not to discuss you with her. Idk. Whatever boundaries make you feel more comfortable. "
"It sounds like she was widowed and the first husband died, not that they divorced. She wouldn't likely have gotten his life insurance if they had divorced"
Maybe I have. I did need to be busy when she first died to make ends meet. But now I suppose I don't have to do all that anymore.

"This explains why sister wasn't at the house when OP arrived.

It doesn't explain ignoring OP's texts for two hours and leaving them hanging out in front of sister's house like creepers.

How much time is ""sorry. at mom's. can't leave.""?"
You're not getting a lot of love here and I'm not sure why. You came for some perspective and that's a good thing. You sound like your head is screwed on right so I think you'll be fine. Good luck! 
Also add in that she wasted sixty dollars and the entirety of Christmas day on it. That's huge. 
"You're spending 97.5%of the year with him. Maybe he just needs that 2.5% to unwind and relax.

You'll see him again soon."
"Seems like your fiance is very family oriented. I am too. Truthfully, if my SO pulled that shit on my niece and DOESN'T SEE HOW THEY'RE IN THE WRONG...I would REALLY REALLY reconsider this relationship. Because I'd see my SO as a selfish self centered turd for doing that to a FREAKING FIVE YEAR OLD Foster child. what the fucking hell. You seriously overstepped your boundaries. If that was my child, you would have been kicked out of my house already."
"People ARE more important: I loved my dogs deeply and would always  have rescued my human family members first. But there's no way your parents are animal lovers, because they don't seem to understand, animals are possessions but they aren't inanimate things.

But I'm frankly MORE disturbed your parents are ok with the beating of a subordinate, lying, *collaborative* lying, attempt to deprive you of your ""best friend"" because he doesn't like it, manipulation to get his own way, etc. Anyone willing to use tactics like this will eventually use them on you again when you don't prove pliable. And possibly your helpless children. Now imagine you get divorced because he's done something else ethically black to you: you break up, no doubt acrimoniously, your kids get to spend half their time there by default in most places. Alone. With him using his tactics.

If you floated the idea of a new puppy as a hypothetical, I'd be very interested what this snake would say about that."
"LOL at people trying to compare a random castle in Romenia to Trump Tower/Disneyland...

Anyway, those rumours that the Bran Castle is up for sale have been around since 2007. The owners refuse to sell it however, so even if your parents have 800 million dollars in their bank account, if they had to pay for more to get it it would be MUCH MORE than the actual price. And it would be dumb.

Your sister is young, maybe she'll grow out of this. The castle however is pretty cool and I wanna visit it someday."
You're probably right but it's pretty awful to ignore 90% of what your SO says... so there's no excuse for him being a jackass.
"How about you push her off next time. Show her the bruises. Have a dead serious face on. Leave the house when she doesn't accept what you're saying maturely. I am a biter too, I often have lots of fun biting on non sexual situations but the moment my SO said it hurt I stopped dead in my tracks because it made me feel like shit that I upset or hurt them. I UNDERSTOOD that I went too far and it embarrassed me. I don't understand why your girlfriend thinks it's hilarious to hurt you. You might be a man but you can get hurt too and maybe she doesn't realize that. "
I come from a family of alcoholics. You did the right thing through and through - drinking and insisting you're okay to drive? They could kill somebody. Please talk to your mum!
"OP, your dad might not be dating short term because of you. Keep in mind that your mom didn't only bail on you, she left him. I don't know how long they were together, but something like that leaves a mark. Your dad might be breaking up with these girls for a lot of reasons, but I'd say him being scared of being hurt again could have a lot to do with it. If he breaks up with them after a few weeks, it means he doesn't get close to them, and they don't get to hurt him.

Let him know that if he wants, it's cool with you if he has a long term girlfriend. That way there's not so much pressure on him, and he knows you support the idea. In the end though, it's up to him! "

"As another former vet tech/boarding &amp; daycare person, this all the way! While reading the post, I was trying to figure out how in the world this lady structures her business. She's got overlapping clients who've never interacted before all staying at her house, for starts. Has no clue if they're aggressive (food or otherwise), doesn't seem to itemize personal possessions dog arrives (and should leave) with, doesn't listen to owner instructions, isn't aware of how much food her charge typically eats, etc. I'm wondering if she even has any policies regarding flea/tick prevention and vaccination records. :( 

This woman sounds like one of those people who ""looove animals"". That's totally cool, but to me that attitude, combined with her displayed level of competence, suggest that she should have (at best) one client at a time and be watching them out of *their* house, not hers. 

Also, I've no experience with Rover, but it strikes me as shady that she's apparently trying to subvert the TOS for the site. Furthermore, the best petsitters I've met want all the feedback (good and bad) they can get, so they can be great at what they do. Making excuses/brushing off concerns says ""this is just how I make a buck"", imo."

&gt; Due to the powerful lobby of the diamond industry, most synthetic diamonds are labeled as such—so although you might feel cheap wearing a synthetic, in fact, you probably own a better product than those that have come out of the earth!

This is about making YOU feel better and you don't seem to care, again, how she is a legit human being and doesn't need you to basically come along in some bogus desire for ""closure"" at her expense. 

She's back in the States.  If she wants to look you up, I imagine she knows where to find you.   But leave her alone and don't go yanking her around when you don't know where she's at emotionally or if she has any interest in seeing you at all.  "

"Going to shamelessly piggyback on the top comment here. 

I am 24 and used meth from when I was 18-21. At first I used infrequently (think maybe once every other month or so) and at my worst I was using every day and would do so in increments of maybe a week at a time (still with relatively small amounts). 

Meth affects everyone differently. I would lose 10 lbs while on it and gain it back in the two months I was off of it, and certainly never became tiny. That being said, a lot of the people I hung out with did. Also, while my teeth did become weaker, and I did chip my front teeth slightly while using, my dental needs are not nearly as dire as your son's.

All of that being said, the biggest red flags for me are the hostility and especially the isolation. I lashed out when I was coming down or recovering from coming down, and then I'd get high again and try to casually smooth over any concern I'd caused. I apologized a lot while I was high for things I did while I was not. I also 'lived' with my dad at the time, and he'd see me maybe once a week. Other family? I'd make plans while I was high and in a good mood, but would cancel the plans and avoid phone calls. 

Finally my dad reached the end of his rope with my irresponsibility (couldn't keep a job, flunked out of college, was constantly gone and irritable when home) and was going through my things and packing them so that I could move out when he found my pipe. He kicked me out, but my mom took me in. I had no job, and she wouldn't give me cash. I had no car at the time, and the only places she would take me were to fill out applications. No phone, no money, no talking to my old 'friends'. Even when I got a job, my step-dad took me to work, and all the money went to an account that was set up to where I had to have one of them present to withdrawal money. It was tough, and I thought it was terrible at the time, but their harshness and unyielding attitude is what saved my life. I went back to college, and have a stable income from a union job until I complete my schooling. 

Tl;dr: Your son sounds like an addict. Addicts take kindness and use it for everything that it's worth. Stop supporting him in ways that he could use to further his addiction.

Harsh but it would work to get him to shut the fuck up.  So odd and highly inappropriate what this guy is doing. Really low
"I don't know if she's testing you—but you are certainly *testing her* with this 'two strikes' bullshit.

She might be game-playing. You are definitely game-playing. If you want a fully honest relationship, start being honest already. Use your words.

This isn't working for you, right now. Speak up. It may mean you need to break up, because you are two decent people who just don't want the same things, but stop tip-toeing around, resenting her and blaming her and imagining what she might be thinking. You have no idea what is going on in her brain. It sounds like it's been weeks, if not months, since you addressed the sex issue in a direct, honest way.

Use your words and make a decision about whether this is a relationship you want to be in or not. Stop making assumptions and tests and secret deals with yourself. Speak up for yourself and what sort of relationship you want to be in."
"It's not that it's unusual, but that is the exact type of people I've had try to start fights with me while out in the city."
"I work in a downtown area. Most of the time it isn't the business woman, teenager, or sandwich shop guy who causes problems. At the same time though, most homeless and/or mentally ill people do not cause problems. So you treat everyone with respect and kindness, and assume that they'll do the same to you.

But if it's in an isolated area, keep away. In that situation, you are the only person/people they have to interact with, and possibly have limited resources to call for help *if* that interaction doesn't go well. And, if the person is mentally ill, that's a bigger ""if"" (however much bigger) than if the person is not. 

I understand where they're coming from, but at the same time you have to be realistic, even if you don't express it in politically correct ways."
"This is the thing. It takes a special kind of naivety (not uncommon in their age group, not judging) to brush this off. They're acting like OP's boyfriend thought this guy was an axe murderer. People don't have to be around long or experience much bad stuff before they realize there's a lot of bad shit that is far less extreme, but nonetheless not fun to experience. 


The likelihood of this guy hurting them is probably really, really, really small. But the likelihood of something unpleasant coming from that situation is pretty high. Even just an uncomfortable or unsettling conversation would fall in this category, as anybody who has spoken to a seriously out of touch/really fucked up and high person can attest to the very primitive reaction our brains have when we suddenly realize something is *really* ""Not Right"". It's why stigma against the mentally ill is so easy and ubiquitous. It's not a fair reaction, but I think it is a very human one that however unfairly, can protect us as long as we use the smarter part of our brain to determine when it is useful and when it is just prejudice. And unless you can help this person (i.e they are in immediate danger), it's best to give them a wide berth, even for their own dignity, as well. Mostly, for OP's boyfriend, growing up in a bad neighbourhood has probably made his brain jump to drugs long before basic mental illness... and people on weird ass drugs are way, way more scary and unpredictable than someone who is just mentally ill. 


Dismissing the situation because the worst case scenario is very unlikely to happen just shows that OP's friends have lived very blessed lives... and lucky for them! But if they want to keep it up, they're going to have to open their eyes a little bit. They're at the age where mom and dad aren't looking over their shoulders and steering them away from these situations before they start. OP's boyfriend has obviously had to do it for himself before. Once they are without people like that for very long, they'll learn why he made the right call. The cost of moving on with their evening is so minor to make it worth doing, even if the chance of something truly bad happening was slim."
This!! FB actually has a wealth of privacy settings you can customize to restrict what certain people see or keep them from posting things to your wall without your permission. I'd highly recommend digging into them if you want to avoid the always awkward conversation for why you defriended grammy on FB
"If that works for you, great. For me, I found that when I asked girls out *before* I had time to get a crush on them (or when it was just starting), it worked better because when it's out in the open that you see each other as dating material, the crushes/feelings can develop on both sides at the same time."

"Some people are just mean and/or miserable when they're drunk. Sounds like you don't enjoy it, which is a superb reason to quit drinking."
"Ugh, OP, this makes my skin crawl. I am so concerned for you with this and the 'I'll show you how much of an asshole I can be' comments. 

I'm so sorry that your friends don't understand where you are coming from. I just want to tell you that your feelings are completely valid and understandable, and don't ever feel as though it's wrong to not want someone to violate your boundaries. 

This is sort of off-topic but everyone else is covering how to help you get away from this guy, so I just want to say this - it might be good for you to have some time on your own for awhile after this. You can find out more about yourself and who you really are, and gain more confidence in what you want. "
"Wait, why are you posting about a hypothetical that already happened?? What did the group do, what did you do? I'm confused why you speak of this in future tense, when it's past tense, and you already know how this all turned out."

"But he wasn't smoking when they got together and was giving her the impression he had stoped for good. He has now suddenly started again and is lying about it.

So he's the one that has changed during their relationship, and she wants him to change back.

She still can't force him to quit, especially as he straight up said he won't quit, but it's not that odd that's she wants him to quit. She supported him whilst he quit (as a friend) and entered the relationship with him expecting him to stay quit, so this is a rather drastic change in their relationship. It's not so suprising she's upset by it."
"have you (and your GF) spoken to a therapist about all this?  It sounds like you just speak to her sister?  

There's a lot of legal and emotional (and physical) issues that would impact your GF and possibly you.

And after you and your GF explore those, your GF may need to say no.  and the Sister will need to be ok with it - she can't be pressuring your GF to have a baby."

"It needs to be done ASAP, but I don't think you should do it on Christmas Eve or Christmas. I can't give you an actual time limit. Just please do not ruin that poor girl's Christmas more than you have to. She's going to remember this forever, Wow, I'm so sad for her.

"Not to sound condescending (hope this doesn't), but being horribly sick for a day != flu + a week of fever + morning sickness that itself typically goes on for weeks.

You keep going back to how all of this points to you being unlikable or bad in some way.  Where does that deep-rooted and automatic reaction come from?

It (for the purposes of this discussion) doesn't *matter* whether people do, or do not, like your art. 

What *matters* is your automatic assumption that the reason they did not respond as you hoped was *because* they didn't like it or you as a person.

That comes from somewhere.

This isn't the first time in your life when you assumed that people didn't like you.

So when was the first time you believed that you were unlikable?"

It just seems like you are utterly unwilling to hear or respect any of her clearly stated views and keep trying to rationalise them out of existence.

"I love the way loads of people jump to the nuclear / legal / change the locks option here .....this isnt a court room, its a problem between friends..... You just gotta sit down with your room mate and talk it through 

But first up OP - decide what you want .....do you want here to live here and pay her fair share, or do you want her to be here less.

If its the second option, dont start any conversation about paying her share  or ue that as an excuse ......because that might just end up in your roomate and his girlfriend agreeing to pay more of the bills and her moving in.....  if the deal is that you dont want her to live here then thats what you need to say i.e.  you dont want her coming round when hes not in, you want here here less.....reason being you want to live with just your roommate, not your roommate and his GF

if its just about the bills, then just have a conversation about wanting here to chip in some money.....your room mate and his GF might decide to move in / move out so they are both only paying one set of bills between them ....keep in mind you could argue it shouldnt be a three way split...because they only have one bedroom ......there migth be loads of amicable ways to resolve this....she moves in and puts her name on lease, you move out and take your off......your room mate moves out and you find another roomate.........(in the UK, landlords often just have one tenant on the lease, and other people staying there isnt an issue as much ...guess these thing might vary for you )

but at the end of the day, if your buddy and his GF want to live together.....it will resolve in a way where that happens, you cant force the roomie and bromie thing forever "

"Do you know that he works in intelligence, or did he only tell you?  As a general rule, if letting people know where he works is going to cause a problem, then he wouldn't even be permitted to tell you.  Certainly, if he's an international spy, he's not going to be allowed to tell you.

There's a possibility that he's making his job out to be something it isn't.  If he's an analyst, for instance, he would probably be permitted to say, ""I'm an analyst for the government,"" as long as he doesn't discuss any details of his work or programs.

"So many problems here before you even get to the major issue.


First of all, why the hell would you date your BIL's brother? That just sounds like a recipe for disaster. Even if it ends on okay terms, it's a person you have to see at family events for the rest of your life, and can cause tension between your sister and her husband.

He's 23 and you are 30. That's a big age difference, and probably stage in life.

He refers to an ex as ""that dumb bitch"". I'd doubt his maturity and ability to be in and communicate in a functional relationship, if that's how he refers to people he dated.


And that's before this $5k thing. Is he so super rich that $5k is pocket change for him? I'm assuming not...and spending money like that is also a red flag. But he is being dishonest and refusing to communicate, and seems like an ass.

It's been 4 months. Get out."
Probably so. 
Obituaries are usually publicly available online. I've looked a few up before.
"I married my best friend. Been friends for around 8-9 years and before we started dating we discussed all that. He thought I was trying to not be in a relationship with him but I wanted to make sure we were right for each other. I moved in with him, got engaged and had a year long live together before our wedding. We are perfect for each other. But if we hadn't been I was going to know before it got serious. "

"I think you should do as she asks and seriously think about what the day to day reality of life with a chronically ill wife with PTS will look like. Really consider the implications and if after all that you are still certain that you want to marry her then have a serious discussion and share your thought processes, let her know you did as she asked.

I say this as a person with a serious chronic illness. We are aware of the stress and strain and that some people just can't deal. If you haven't already learn about her illness and what possible outcomes the future may hold.

As for your family, I'd call their bluff. They are being jerks. I'd tell her that whether or not you stay a couple, you'll be calling your family on their BS, out of principle.

"He's not being a brat. He's three. He's testing rules and boundaries which is 100% normal and healthy behaviour at that age.

You've done the most important bit, which is be firm with the boundaries set.  

When you tell a toddler they can't have/do something, give them a different option instead of just a no. ""that's for grownups, you won't like the taste. How about some cordial/juice./appropriate drink?"" Put the things he cannot have well out of reach, even if they have to be refrigerated for it. His safety comes before the party. 
  

He is sulking in the corner because he is upset. This is a real feeling that he has, it's over something small but if that's what he's upset about don't diminish his feelings. They're real and he feels them. Offer solution (appropriate drink) and distraction (activity) and if he doesn't take it let him be sad for a while, he's allowed to just be sad for a while if that's what he wants to do. It's fine.

You're getting annoyed with him being upset because it makes you feel like the bad guy, take a step back and recognise that saying no doesn't make you the bad guy. If his mums come in while he's sad say ""he's sad that he can't have vodka. Doesn't want to have appropriate drink instead or do an activity. 

DO NOT let your emotional response to his behaviour be shown. Calm, no yelling, watch your tone. How you react to a minor annoyance like a toddler doing toddler things and being upset when told no is going to be (a part of) his blueprint for dealing with minor annoyances. Keep calm, keep things in perspective, remember his age."
"This is the thing. You can forgive him, but still know that he isn't someone you want a closer relationship with.

"Think of it like this: is she drinking and driving? Is she consuming alcohol daily? Is she consuming obscene amounts of alcohol? Is she getting blind drunk? Is she breaking laws, fighting, or hurting others while drunk? If the answer to these questions is no, then you need to stop worrying about it. How? Every time you get upset remind yourself that as long as she's not harming others or harming herself that it's not a problem. Associate mild controlled drinking with positive memories. Having a glass or two of wine over a romantic dinner or having a few shots and a good time with friends or a fun celebratory round. I come from an alcoholic family, so drinking usually is associated with anger and rage for me. Instead I've tried to associate it with fun stuff and I keep in mind how much I drink. I go out with my friends, and I'll pour so I can pour a little lighter, or I'll have some wine with family over dinner making a positive memory."

"Noooo, don't ask his father to talk to him.... that's a sign of immaturity and it can cause more drama.  You're 31 and he's 34.  You need to talk to him DIRECTLY.  [You don't want a BF who'll only validate your feelings if his Dad tells him too]

I get why you're upset, I do; however, this is a small thing in the grand scheme of a relationship.  If you need to go through his father, that's a sign that there are communication and trust issues. 

If you don't feel like you can talk to the BF directly, get yourself to therapy asap.

"I think you are totally right.

 OP's mom's perspective was just...shocking. No wonder sister shuts down or can't find the right words. 

It is hard to imagine OP's family overlooking the social graces around including everyone if it were a party of friends. Why would she want to take the risk of asking about not bringing the presents rather than just bring them? 

I've never heard of a Christmas scheduling problem where the solution was to not have everyone do everything together. 

The priority set is very off-kilter. Is she a member of the family or not? Why treat her like the stranger amongst friends, or the friend amongst family? Her status would be upsetting to anyone. "

"I would actually go about this a bit differently than some suggest.  I would make copies, as others have said...but I would have those pictures and videos open when they both come back and confront them immediately.  You need to see both his reaction and how your boyfriend responds.  There is a slight chance your boyfriend knows about this, which needs to be ruled out.  You also need to show them immediately so that your boyfriend can react immediately and shut it down, and so that creeper doesn't have a chance to make up a story."

"Half your age plus 7 is my go to for age differences. half his age plus 7 is 21-22 and even though its just a math equation imo it works very well. You're 18, if you follow the equation your MINIMUM dating age would be 16. How would you, your family, or your friends feel about you dating a 14-15 year old? thats pretty much whats going on here. Even at 23 I would almost never dream of dating someone at 18 because theres just such a huge difference in life experiences. I'm not saying break up with him or anything like that but just hearing those numbers it seems crazy that a 31 year old would want to be with an 18 year old, because honestly you are a kid to him.


As far as his family goes they probably have a lot of hangups about the relationship as a whole. I wouldnt take anything personally from them even though i'm sure its difficult. It's also probably in your best interest to have as little contact as possible even if you want to be involved in his family life.

I'm just worried that if he got into a car/motorcycle accident his crazy mom would get the house and I would have to move out the next day having invested all this money for a home that isn't even mine. 

I'm starting to think my real issue is with her. its really good to talk about this with someone. "
"What you're talking about isn't real. It's a fairy tale. Real relationships have conflict, real humans have petty moments. If your idea of a functional relationship is what you're describing, you're going to be continuously hurt and let down by the reality that relationships aren't always chill and dtf and low maintenance. Real relationships have fights, rocky periods, and times where you're furious at your partner. The beauty of this is that, when handled in a healthy way, these moments help you grow individually and as a couple, and help you truly know the other person for everything that they are-- good, bad, and ugly. If you can't readjust your perspective, you're going to have a very rude awakening. "

I have friends who are gun owners (hunters), who keep their guns in gunsafes or off of their property in lockers at the range.  This does not bother me.  But I fundamentally disagree that having a gun in the home makes you safer.  You may not be able to compromise on this, as your boyfriend's vision of gun ownership is not for recreational use, but as a 24/7 means of protection, and you know that having a gun near you 24/7 would make you less safe, both psychologically and physically."

You say that he makes you feel inadequate, but also does it in way that you feel it's petty to bring it up. That's manipulation. Clear as a day. You're a confident person with self worth, he doesn't have his shit together and has a psychological need to bring you down. 
For your own sake, just move on from him. No matter how strong you are to begin with everybody can be lured in and eventually dragged down by that kind of person.

"&gt; The natural outcome for a person who prioritises their partners jealousy over their on right to maintain good friendships is to end up friendless and alone.

This is exactly what happened to me. My ex was jealous and insecure about the majority of my friendships. It ended up with him isolating me from most of my friends, and when we did eventually break up after I caught him cheating, I found myself with very few people to turn to in my time of need."
"32-34??? you don't even know his age, that alone is a huge red flag. have you actually had the ""i want to be in a committed monogamous relationship with you"" conversation, or have you just been assuming he's being exclusive with you?"
"That kind of gesture may come from a good place but would ultimately just enable the family, either you would have to cover for them forever or dad would be in for a disappointment when he eventually realized the truth."
"You need to be honest with him. If you aren't he won't learn from it, and you'll be looking at getting crummy gifts for far longer than you should.

Frankly, this just sounds wildly immature to me. But he's 19, so that's not really that surprising."
I've known bald people since high school... until I hit 30s most of them had plenty of hair and just chose to shave it/buzz it short. Now most of them do it because it's better than the alternative 
"How's your mom and dad's sense of humour? The next time she comes over everyone should be wearing chokers. Your friend, you, your mom, your dad.. EVERYONE! Either she'll get the hint or her head will explode. You win either way. "
"That means you're either going to get the short end of the stick, or have to learn to raise hell like she does to get basic respect. Both options are shit."
"&gt; when she was accused of cheating

Pretty sure OP has not accused her of cheating. EDIT: From [OP's response below](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5ky08e/me_33_m_with_my_wife31_f_of_5_years_together_10_i/dbrulfm/):

&gt;I've never, and still haven't, accused her directly of cheating."
"I try and remind myself of this as much as I can. I haven't agreed on a house yet because of this but I just have a hard time trying to figure out what he is hiding or why. 
"
Even without this problem I don't think they should be getting married at 19 - so young. Rarely it works out
"Yeah, it was something people generally didn't talk about in my profession. I was working somewhere else when it happened, and a lot of people wore wedding/fashion rings. After that happened, nobody was, haha. 

I do like the idea of the chain, though, someone else mentioned that as well. "
"Right? If he's trying to keep someone(s) in the dark, doesn't he know how to limit post viewing for certain groups/people?"
"I agree, just ghost her, don't give explanations."
"This is a beautiful comment. So simple, but so full of truth. I love seeing things like this on Reddit. "
"&gt;If I were to write a list of guys that I've slept with, some of them could be ""dude in yellow shirt"". It's really awful.

Can I just say - there's nothing to be ashamed of!  Apologies can't compare my exact situation but I too went through a string of one-night stands with guys I can't remember the names of.  There's too much pressure, particularly on women, to 'only have the right kinds of sex'.  Whatever!  Are they my proudest moments?  Not really.  But you learn and move on.  And anybody who dares to shame me on it, doesn't deserve to be a part of my life - and the same should be for you.

&gt;If you were to find out from someone else that your girlfriend has in fact had a lot of ONS's, would you break up?

I don't think you owe it to him to reveal any details.  But from your post it sounds like, you may be looking for him to give you validation that you can't give yourself.  If you haven't already, getting in touch with a therapist might help to at least come to terms with your past and your experiences.  

And when you do tell him, if he's not OK with it, then he's not the right guy.  It may seem like you're losing a lot, especially considering that this is the first 'real' relationship you've been in, but think of this long-term.  This is your life and a partner should be someone who supports you - not makes you feel worse about an already traumatic time in your life.  

Everyone deserves respect.  You deserve respect.  You deserve to be loved, supported, and not judged - even by yourself.

"Your fiancee attempted to murder someone.       



Now is a very good time to think about your life and how you want it to look.  You may want to stop making excuses for him and examine who he really is and while your at it you may consider raising the standards you have for a potential husband."
... and lying is a ***HUGE*** red flag.
"Basically a red piller is someone who believes in the ideology that men are superior to women and that the only ""natural"" and therefore stable hetero relationship is one where the woman defers to the man. There is a bunch of advice on how to keep a woman under your control based on a lot of pseudoscientific evolutionary psychology.

It's basically a subreddit full of super bitter men giving each other tips on how to alienate the women in their lives even more effectively."
"When I was younger I had a long distance BF that would say the exact same thing when I wanted to go out and party. He would claim that it gave him anxiety attacks and make him panic and said it was all for my own sake. So I just stayed in my room all weekend.

In hindsight that was a big mistake. He was paranoid, insecure, and very controlling. Since we broke up I've really grown a lot and he didn't trust me or care about my fun.

My advice - go to the rave. If he blows up that's his fault and dump his ass."
Holy moly. Are you in counseling? Medication? Anything?
"When you were pregnant as a teen, could anyone convince you not to have your son? 
 Here's how I see this - you can't convince him to force his girlfriend to do anything. You need to realize you are going to become a grandmother. A baby is on the way, 2 teens are facing something that is the biggest thing anyone can face. They need you right now, that baby will need you. Sit him down and tell him what's coming- no sleep, no life,no nothing but baby,baby,baby for the next 2 years. He is getting ready to make a life long commitment. Talk to him about the financial side of being a parent, does he have a job? A bank account? Talk to him about a budget, take him shopping for baby stuff so he knows just how much everything is going to cost. And just be there for them,all 3 if needed. Stop focusing on stopping them from having the baby and focus on helping them."
"I don't think it's weird. Some people show affection through giving gifts. He said he wants you ""happy and secure."" I wouldn't read too much into it unless it was paired with controlling behaviors. Your friend who thinks he may be doing these things to control you financially in the future is jumping to conclusions. If you continue to work and maintain the ability to support yourself, it shouldn't be a problem. If the relationship were to change, you'd have the means to leave. I think your past experiences of abuse are making you very weary, which is understandable. "
