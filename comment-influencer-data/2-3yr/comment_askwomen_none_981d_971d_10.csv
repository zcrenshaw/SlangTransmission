"That actually makes a hilarious amount of sense, especially when considering my extremely slavic surname and all the people we ate."
"Ooh, fun question! The older I get, the more uncharacteristic I realise my childhood was. There's a lot more than the below, but here's some stuff I can think of now:

- When I was 8, my parents suddenly decided ""fuck it, let's go live in Europe!"" (we're from Australia). I spent a year out of the school system living in the back of a van as we drove from country to country. 

- During this period, my parents would send me to the markets to say cute things in the local languages for free food. We'd also raid fields for food (I mostly remember doing it with tomatoes in France).

- My parents didn't have 'real' jobs; they made money through renovating and flipping houses and dealing antiques. For most of my childhood, literally nothing in any of our houses except for electronics were made after 1950.

- This included most of my own entertainment: I was reading books and playing with toys from the 1800s and early 1900s.

- As a result, I assumed everyone used/had oil lamps, cast iron stoves, washboards, snuff boxes, etc. I also had some pretty dated vocabulary, due to the aforementioned books. Did you know the word 'ejaculated' was used pretty frequently in 19th century literature for sudden/loud statements? Yeah.

* Consequently, a rumour went around that I was a ghost in not one, but two of the schools I was sent to.

* Looking back, the fact that my hands were always bleeding from copious hand washing might have also lent credence to the ghost rumours (three cheers for severe childhood OCD! except three is a bad number, and my pets will die if we cheer three times, so let's make it four). 

* I have three half-siblings from both my mother and father. I was raised an only child. I've met my half-sister less than a handful of times, one of my half-brothers maybe a dozen times, and I don't even know the name of my other half-brother. It makes answering the question, ""Do you have any sisters or brothers?"" tricky. ""No, but maybe two or three.""

* It was hard to make friends because no one wanted to come over to my house. Looking back, it might have been the 19th century coffin that was the centrepiece of the lounge room that deterred them. 

* My houses were permanently under construction. It was pretty normal for me to have to shuffle/crawl across a beam suspended over a steep drop to get to the kitchen/bathroom/what-have-you because dad had removed the wooden floorboards in a lifted house.

* Despite being desperately poor for most of my childhood, my 10th birthday present was a Shetland pony with a giant pink bow wrapped around its torso??

"My first SO had just died. A week later, his best friend asked if I was over him and would go on a date. What the hell, dude?"
"This is the most first-world of problems for me but, I'm a gamer, comic book nerd and all around music/band nerd. 

I constantly get completely ignored or side-eyed if I ever try to engage in any of these communities. I stick to my hobbies at home with the small number of friends who know me well and don't treat me like an imposter. 

Despite wanting to get into cosplay, I don't have it in me for the attention it would bring and yet another layer of ""you don't know anything, you just want the attention"" - which is so much salt in the wound.

"the other day when I was in line getting coffee, the little boy in line behind me said to his dad ""daddy, why is that girls hair so long?"" and i kind of giggled to myself and the dad said ""i don't know, that's how she likes it"" and the little boy responded ""i like it too, she looks pretty!"" and it was easily the cutest, sweetest thing ever. my heart melted! compliments from little kids are the best! "
"For me, it's actually a negative dating in the real world. The number of times I've heard ""But you're pretty, I can't believe you're single!"" is bananas. It makes me think that no one is dating me or approaching me because they assume someone else is. DATE ME. PLEASE. I'M LONELY. "
"Putting marshmallows and brown sugar on sweet potatoes sounds revolting. And then, having the nerve to call it a casserole and serve it as a side dish instead of dessert..??? Wtf! I don't know how it became such a beloved dish."
"I'm fairly young (mid twenties) and have had a hard time advancing in the workplace despite getting more responsibility at work. I was told by the HR person in charge of the hiring committee for the internal transfer I applied for that I didn't have a chance because older male coworkers wont take me seriously and could get distracted.

I put in a complaint with the VP of staff and left that job."
I think your parents might be vampires.
"My parents got divorced when I was 2 and I didn't have much of a relationship with my father, because he was a drunk and abusive. I saw him every couple of years for a few hours, sometimes a few days every couple of summers. When I became old enough to drive I decided to try and get to know him better. I was 17 and I drove a few hours to spend the day with him. Everything was going better than expected. He and my uncle fixed a few things on my car, my dad took me to the flea market, he remarked about how ""See, I don't drink as much now,"" when he only had two huge glasses while walking around. We hung out with some people he knew. Towards the end of the afternoon it was just the two of us talking and he was getting a bit drunk by this point and he walked closer to me and made a comment about my breasts and how beautiful I was then asked if he could touch me. 

So the most inappropriate person to hit on me was my father. WTF dad. 

I booked it out of there and we didn't speak for 11 years, then I found out he was dead. It reconnected me with his side of the family, where I also found out he'd bullied my grandmother while she was dying and stolen everything, including some stock my late grandfather had intended to go to me to pay for college. So he drank away tens of thousands of dollars and I am here with an associates degree because I could never afford to finish college.

Thanks dad.  "
"I talk to myself. Not in like a thinking out loud kind of way, but in a daydreaming out loud kind of way. I'll act out various conversations and scenarios without even really thinking about it. And often I don't really realize I'm doing it. "

* Emotional maturity.  How do they act during a disagreement?  Do they call me names? Do they walk off down the street without saying anything?  Can they discuss matters calmly and try to see both sides?

* Financial savvy.  I didn't expect anyone to be rich, but I did desire to find someone else who lived within their means, didn't spend money they didn't have, etc.

"Thinking that men actually like you as a person but it turns out they just want to fuck you and just see you as a walking vagina that doesn't have thoughts/ feelings is a pretty shitty experience.

It stopped happening after my early 20s though. Theories on that; I stopped meeting college guys and also got fat. Now I'm basically just a dude to most men.  

Another issue from my early 20s - I think that people assume that when you're pretty, you're also extroverted/ very social. I'm very introverted and attention from strangers who just wanted to have casual conversation with me was extremely off-putting. Again, stopped happening when I gained weight so it's like... clearly there's only one reason you were talking to me, and it's not because I looked friendly and interesting."
"To me, they weren't lost. They were spent learning how to be healthier. "
"Many.  My social circle is very ""intersectional feminist,"" which distressingly seems to be more and more dominated by white, cis, working-class women who aren't thrilled with the way white, cis, wealthy women are dominating the conversation, and also have a few black friends.  It's a step up, but not that huge of one.

The weird thing is, I notice it very strongly when it comes to the discussion of hair, which is a topic in feminism and race that is important, but not like, the *most* important.  The movie *Good Hair* came out in 2009, and I have to say, 2009-2014 was a constant stream of white women and their opinions about black women's hair.  We are not only burning off our scalps (they know, because a black man told them!), but also *poisoning the ground water* with our nefarious perms (but white women getting Brazilian blowouts and putting bleach all over everything is just fine I guess).  Yet, wearing my natural hair still throws up a lot of roadblocks for me, many of them enforced by white women.  We are told that our hair is soooooooo beeeeyooootiful by Well Meaning White Women, but in practice, it's only ok on some exotic model or singer they never have to deal with, not on someone who has to sit in a desk next to them or run a cash register in their store.  We're poisoning the groundwater with our home-grown self-hatred, but are still expected to have straight hair.  That, plus a lot of other topics (the appearance of ""white"" anime characters, skin bleaching in India, etc) so often is framed by white women as ""women of color trying to be white"" (which itself has the implication of blaming women of color, rather than a white dominated society), when the issue is so much more nuanced and complicated than that.

Someone else mentioned the ""wait your turn"" attitude, particularly in regards to voting, which has been around as long as feminism as we know it has been around.  Part of the problem is that black women (and to varying extents, other non-white women) are de-feminized and viewed as very masculine, no matter how feminine-presenting and dainty we are.  This idea works itself into mainstream and ""intersectional"" feminism, where I still see the idea that ""women are white, blacks are men"" attitude.  I am very frequently the target of lectures about how ""black people"" have been able to vote since the 1860s, and ""women"" have only been able to vote since the 1920s.  The idea that *black women* were not legally allowed to vote until the 1920s seems to be completely new information to them, much less the fact that vote suppression of minorities was enforced *extremely* violently through the 1960s (being able to vote doesn't mean much if your mutilated corpse is hanging from a tree the next day), and to an extent, is happening through less gruesome means today.  I was also not a huge fan of Hillary Clinton through any of the recent elections, and the refrain seemed to be ""but it's *women's turn,*"" as if prior to 2008, there had been a black president, or that since it is women's turn, it absolutely must be *that* woman's turn.  The fact is, it's never black people's turn, and in the exceptionally rare cases that it is, it's always a black man's turn.  When it's a woman's turn, it's always a white woman's turn.  It is never, ever a black woman's turn, and there's nothing progressive or feminist about saying that black women must wait their turn as if their rightful place in line is behind white women.  

One more example, because this is getting long, is assuming all historical women had the exact same experiences.  So much of the feminist discourse right now is about how ""back in the day,"" women had no choice to be housewives and mothers, and my great-grandma would have been married off to the highest bidder after finishing school to begin her life of drudgery.  Uh, excuse me, *no*.  A life of domestic drudgery in women has *always* been the mark of privilege and affluence, regardless of color, but especially considering it.  My grandma didn't grow up going to debutante balls, she worked low paid jobs until my mother was a grown woman.  My great grandma didn't go to finishing school or stay home with the children, she picked cotton in the summer and taught school in the winter, and still had to perform housework on top of all that and 13 kids.  Their contemporaries were maids, worked as teachers, or on farms, or in factories, or in laundries.  My great-great-grandmother?  Was literally a slave.  Even asking more diverse groups of white women, this idea that ""women"" of the past all floated through life prim and proper and taken care of, but given no professional options, disappears.  Women from Ireland and Poland and everywhere else came here as maids, washerwomen, farmhands, and to work in sweatshops.  No, they weren't able to become lawyers and CEOs, but neither were their husbands.  Don't get me wrong, professional options for women and breaking the glass ceiling are important goals, but many don't keep in mind that ""working outside the home"" wasn't achieved for women spontaneously in 1972.  A pretty huge proportion of women were working outside of the house already, not out of some desire for professional fulfillment, but because otherwise, their families would starve to death in the streets."

the very nice men my dad brought around liked kids. there was one particularly creepy ''family friend'' that had to be brought along on every family outing/mini vacation or he'd fill our answering machine with threats to kill himself.  he came to our house every night, and when me and my sister would say ''ewww we don't like you go away'' he would sulk and complain until my dad hit us for hurting his feelings. he would complain that me or my little sister were touching ourselves in front of him and seducing him, or report our touching ourselves out of ''concern'' that we might have a gynecological infection.

he came to babysit us after school, i never thought to question it because he was trusted. but years later my mom told me that she never knew that he was there, but i don't know if she knew and was just lying to dodge responsibility. 

there was a brief period where he did something that went too far and my parents cut him off, and me and my sister had to hide in the bushes when we saw his car at our house after school. but he was quickly forgiven and allowed back.

He bought a brand new diamond to propose with. When she asked him why he did that, he basically said, ""I know you *said* you didn't want one, but every woman really wants a new diamond.""

I spent several nights camping in trees because of large packs of coyotes and that was OK in my head.  

My mother taught me how to shoot a pistol and gun safety before I remember.  My dad and I souped up a go cart to go way too fast with no seatbelts or roll cage.  I holster open carried a .22 pistol at age 7.  I solo camped from about 10 onwards, packing my gear miles away by myself on horseback or foot.  

In high school, I worked on a shrimp boat at night and slept after school and a small amount before school.  I did Cheerleading but really wanted to be on the football team.  I open practiced with the football players until I was allowed to play in practices and scrimmages.  I refused to learn to drive until I was 18."
Mayonnaise is absolute trash 
" I constantly feel like that sketch about Ron Swanson at a hardware store around my boyfriend and and his friends.  They over explain things to me and I'm sitting there like ""I know more than you. ..""

It's particularly egregious when my boyfriend is around since I introduced him to Star Trek, Stargate, Farscape, Buffy, Spaced, Monty Python and about a million movies.  A few days back his friend and him had a conversation about Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds and completely excluded me even though I showed him Singin in the Rain, Wishful Drinking AND Postcards from the Edge.  He didn't even know they were related before me.

I don't care that he talks to his friends about things I introduced him too, but if all his knowledge came from me...is it wrong that I just want a writers credit from time to time? "
"When I was 8, I was chatted up by a middle-aged man who, very clearly, tried to get me to come home with him and do god knows what to me. I ran home and told my mother, who was suitably outraged and took me outside to point him out to her. He happened to be standing by the bus stop next to our house and as we were walking over there, some old lady she knew started chatting to us. My mum just talked to her as if nothing had happened, for a good 10 minutes, and the fucking creep just got on the bus and left. 8 y/o me was not amused. 

(Obviously, now I know there wasn't much she could have done but at the time it was a bit WTF)"
"As a teenager (~15 years old) I went to the police to report a particularly vicious beating my father (horribly abusive) gave me.  the detective who talked to me said I was beautiful and to come back and see him when I was 18, wink wink, among other things. 

EDIT: Just remembered these:  Friends husband tried to kiss me while my husband were in the other room.  And in H.S. shop teacher used to call me (only me out of the whole class) to talk and would ask me who I'm dating, if there were any issues with my BF, etc.  And couple I babysat for, the dad would drive me home and ask similar stuff (Bf, what we did, if I ever wanted to take a ride in his Corvette to call him) etc. etc. "

Nope. He was a vicious little shit and trampled me the first week I had him. Dad witnessed it from afar and thought the pony was straight up murdering my arse. My parents sold him to people who actually knew how to horse a couple months later.
"Worst so far: putting up with romantic partners who didn't see me as worthy of basic decency. It destroyed my self esteem. 

Best so far: I started to grow into myself and realize the person I intend to be. I've built a lot of resilience and proven myself stronger than I thought. "
Humbert Humbert from Lolita. He is GROSS. 
That's kinda sweet in a sad way.
"For me it's that people assume that when growing up my brothers were very protective of me. They actually never gave a shit what I was doing. 


Or if I don't want to go out with colleagues they assume it's because my husband wouldn't approve of it. No, I'm not going because *I* don't want to. I just wanna go home, take my pants off and watch tv. "
"This sort of thing happened to me a ton in high school and college. I didn't know what the hell was going on until someone complimented me one day on being smart and ""deciding not to date"". I gave her a bewildered look and told her I was only waiting for someone to ask. 

Apparently a lot of folks had been assuming I didn't date because I'd either chosen not to or wasn't allowed. Once I cleared that up, I finally got asked out shortly after."
"My dad would make me drink milk every day before school. He thought it would help me grow. My mom is only 4'6. A very tiny lady I know. So anyway, every morning he would make me drink a glass of milk, it would make me sick. I'd bloat, have the shits, sometimes puke. It was awful. My mom took me to the doctor and they told her I was lactose intolerant. She came home and told my dad to quit giving me milk because it's making me sick. So what did he do after this? Continued to make me drink milk daily and added a bowl of cereal which only added more milk. He did this with other things in my life too. He was really abusive in this sense. Now I can't stand milk. I try to avoid it at all costs. Also, i'm only 4'9 so my dad was so wrong if he truly believed it would help me grow.🙄 "
"**Worst:** Allowed my sense of pride to stand in the way of asking for help when I needed it the most.  As a result, I was placed on academic suspension from my university and nearly succeeded in ending my life.

**Best:** Finally opened up about my mental health struggles and sought appropriate help, completed a term of service with AmeriCorps, acted as a first responder after a devastating natural disaster in my home state, re-enrolled in college and declared a major that actually interested me, took an internship in South Africa, graduated with a 4.0 major GPA, took a job with a nonprofit agency whose mission I strongly believed in that has led me to the Director position I currently hold, at 30 years old."

"We were friends for years before we got together. We were roommates for a while and we had to move from 1 rental situation to another. We only had my little car to move all of our stuff, and it was about a 30 minute trip both ways. We spent an entire day driving back and forth moving and we had a blast. I remember thinking ""there's no one else in the world I would have this much fun with while moving."" I went to my grandma that night and told her I thought I was in love with him. She just laughed at me like ""duh."" 

almost a year after that he realized he loved me. (he had gone through a nasty divorce at the beginning of our friendship and I didn't want to confess my love for him if he wasn't ready.) I remember the day he fell in love with me. We would always sit outside at this picnic table in the back yard and just hang out. We were out there one day and I was talking and he was just staring at me like a doofus. I said ""why are you looking at me like that?"" and he got all flustered and weird. And like 3 days later asked me out via a note under my door haha. 

We're engaged now and planning our wedding for this fall/winter!"

"Victor Frankenstein. He's just so self-absorbed, affected, arrogant, completely lacking in empathy, entitled, and whiny. Everything that goes badly in the book doesn't go badly because of his creation, but because of his giant jackass personality. 

I really enjoyed the novel, but it was one of the only books I've really struggled to finish solely because of the awful personality of the main character."
"I'm currently in this situation. Dammit, he's a great guy. He's smart and handsome and well travelled and likes all the same things I do...and I've just got nothing, no excitement to see him, no attraction.

"This sounds bad, but if you share a room, do not be overly accommodating when working out your roommate agreement.  If you know you'll feel uncomfortable with others sleeping in the room, let it be known.  Anything like that, don't try too hard to be cool.

Also, talk about problems as soon as they arise, rather than waiting until it's a huge issue.  

If you like peace, considering living in the quiet dorm.  Of course, you can always go out to parties, but quiet dorms tend to be chill and focused on studies.

"At my grandad's funeral, we were walking back to my mum's car where a family friend thought it was appropriate to tell me how he felt about me and if I was interested in going out for dinner with him.

"No, I don't speak Spanish.  Excuse, the fuck out of me, my parents never taught me.  What I picked up I learned on my  own.  

We are just more than your yard man, you painter, your nice little mexican man or woman you encountered at the market.  No, I'm not refried.  What ever the hell that means.

To top it off, I'm mixed.  Apparently I'm not Mexican enough for some, not white enough for others.  I've never really belonged anywhere.

I'm married to a full Mexican (what ever that really means), and grew up around the mexican side of my family.  But yet I'm still an outsider."

Pumpkin spice is bullshit.
One thing I think this movie actually did well was not portraying Allie's fiancee as a total douche in order to justify her cheating on him. James Marsden was a genuinely good dude who got stuck in a love triangle between two shitty and selfish people.
"My mom sent me to rehab because I got drunk ONCE when I was 15.

I was a virgin. My mom became convinced that I was prostituting myself for drugs (wtf). And if I denied anything, that was proof that I was 'in denial', instead of being a virgin that didn't do drugs.

But a lot came out when I was there. Like how she regularly beat the shit out of me with an electric cord. 

Of course, they sent me home with her after I did my time."
"A man once followed me into the bra/panties department of Lord and Taylor where he continued to hit on me, ask me out, try for my number, and refuse to leave me alone until I ran into the dressing room and locked a door."

"Uniqlo Ultra Light Down packable jacket. They're thin, so they layer really well, and they pack down to about the size of a mango.

Edit: Also, H&amp;M's new nail polish line. The brushes are shaped to be wide and flat with a rounded tip rather than rectangular, so it perfectly shapes to the base of the nail, and the formula is really resilient to chipping. I am TERRIBLE at nails and before I never bothered doing them because I'd mess them up in minutes or get it all over my cuticles and fingers. This stuff is goofproof and lasts forever."

"I was 20, walking back to my apartment with Chinese takeout, and a man who was probably late50s/early60s started walking next to me. It was dark, he smelled terrible, and he kept asking me to come back to the halfway house he was bunking in. 

I was very prepared to drop my food and run away, but thankfully my apartment complex had a gate and he didn't follow me inside of it. "

The thing is: I can't tell who is into it because Dr. Oz said gluten causes cancer, or who legit has celiac, so I treat them all the same.

What's cool is that the people who have a serious problem with gluten have more options than they did 10 years ago, and that's *because* of the fad.  So while some people may get all weird and judgy,  it's no skin off my teeth to treat all customers with respect. "

"Xander Harris from Buffy the Vampire Slayer.


Omg, I could write a thesis on the horrors of Xander. He is the original shit ""Nice Guy"". He is absolutely awful to every girl on the show, including the ones he sleeps with. But as if that weren't enough, he carries this possessive torch for Buffy the entire show through which he polices all of her choices and friendships. 

It's admittedly hard to find good male characters in Buffy and it's also true that pretty much all of Buffy's friends are the worst friends. But Xander is just so disgusting. 
I also think that when I was a young teen watching Buffy, the awfulness of Xander didn't really register with me, but as an adult on rewatch, he was unbearable and I cringe to think I watched that as a teen and thought it was acceptable (or worst, good!)."
"My boyfriend came up to me in the kitchen the other day (pajamas, no makeup, messy hair), put his arm around my waist, and spent several seconds staring at different parts of my face. I have eczema that's flaring up (makes me look like I'm terribly breaking out all over my chin) and I'm self conscious about it. 

""What?!"" I said, eventually. 

""You are so beautiful,"" he responded. 

He definitely makes me feel it. "
"Are you basing this off the movies? Because the books are not the same at all. Ron helps to keep Hermione grounded and his ability to be laid back is really necessary in the light of her obsessive nature. For example when she was freaking out about how to conjure fire in the first book, and he reminds her she's a witch. I think they're very complementary. The movies did a great disservice to Ron, even for those who read the books, kinda replaced their memories of him. 

Another thing to consider is that they were 11-17. That's an okay age to not know how to communicate your feelings. She's not very nice to him either, sent a flock of birds to attack him! They are an excellent couple in the end. "

On the rare occasions I *do* actually choose pizza, I only really like white pizzas, because I don't like tomato/marinara sauce. By extension, I don't particularly care for a lot of Italian food.

"Yes, but not in the way you might think.  My experiences are radically different than the less attractive.  People are generally kind and helpful to me, listen to what I have to say, and do as I ask, at work and in the world. I thought it was because we're generally a co operative species, but really, I get treated well for being thin and pretty.  I always feel weirdly guilty when certain staff members act up for the less attractive supervisors and managers.

I also never really know where I stand with anyone, if they like me for my accomplishments or if it's because I'm easy to look at and get along with.  Years of being treated well has made me quite relaxed and generally happy, until I think too much about the implications of it all."
"Once when I was maybe ~11, I turned to my brother at dinner and asked him if he had pubic hair. In front of literally 15 extended family members.

Same brother - when I was probably about the same age, I told my dad that I kept hearing weird noises from his room when his girlfriend was over. My dad then had to tell them to stop having loud sex. 

I also went into my brother's room when said girlfriend was over and asked him if he knew ""what penis tasted like.""

Pretty sure I was hitting puberty and had all these sex questions, but instead of asking the internet like a normal human I just embarrassed my brother repeatedly. 

We still laugh over how I had literally no chill as a child. "

Having to eat dumplings before leaving for a trip (known affectionately as ""fuck off dumplings"" in my family) and noodles upon the return.

Me as a kid wanting to eat certain foods - mainly fruits and nuts - (persimmon, pomegranate, pistachios) and always being warned against eating too much because it'll make me.. fiery? Give me nosebleeds? Something like that.

And there's a lot of foods that my grandma will insist can't be eaten on an empty stomach (bananas, anything acidic)."

He then started talking about how my legs looked in my shorts, and how he'd always make sure I worked the front of the shop because it would bring customers in if they saw someone 'they could imagine bending over the counter.'

"So, I'm trans, and am/was conventionally attractive as both [genders](https://m.imgur.com/a/ZOgBA). While I present very feminine (that's just my personality), I still have some stereotypically ""male"" hobbies like playing guitar/bass, or football, or video games...and I CONSTANTLY, constantly, have to prove myself any time I talk about or partake in those things. Like when I say that I play guitar, they say or think things like ""Taylor Swift songs isn't playing guitar"", it's so goddamn annoying because I can *actually* play...also it leads to uncomfortable uber drives like ones where the driver won't let me get out of the car without ""getting one last good look at me"" as I sit there scared and feel his eyes walking all over my body...   

Before as an attractive man, I was given respect even if I didn't deserve it, like if I was the only guy in my group of friends, people would defer to me like I was the leader even though I was usually just following whatever they wanted to do...or I could just bullshit my way through things that I had no idea what I was doing, and people just assumed that since I was a man, I knew what I was doing and didn't need help.   

These days, it's like every interaction is a constant battle to gain respect and it sucks."
"My whole life is a collection of wtf stories.  I learned everything about sex from a pregnant hooker that was living next to the hotel room that my family of 5 was staying in, after we moved to Fl and our corporate housing ran out.  When I was 15, I dated men as old as 25, and no one batted an eye. I lost my virginity on Millennium New Year because I was convinced the world was going to end. My parents gave me chocolate milk and kool aid as a baby,so I had silver caps on my teeth until I was 8. I could go on forever. "

"I was maybe 10 years old. I was at Butlins with my father and younger brother.

Great for kids, awful when you're over the age of like 8 though.

Anyway I was playing in a playpen thing for kids. Like you have be 12 and under to play in it. And some guy starts shouting at me through the nets, asking for my number. Pretty sure he had a kid in the playpen too. In fairness I did look a lot older than 10, but there's no way you could have mistaken me for legal age. Wtf. No one said anything."

"hah, thanks. i just can't do anything except laugh tbh. 

i'm sure the dudes on redpillparenting think my parents did an amazing job teaching me the balancing act between validating a strange man's feelings but not leading him on and being a slut at such a tender age!

(like seriously, we were punished for both hurting his feelings OR for being too friendly, like taking him by the hand to show him something or sitting on his lap. dad would hit us and say that doing those things made Creep think we were his girlfriend.)

all of this was completely normal too. it was only when i was in a looong string of abusive relationships that i'd realized that i was not only groomed, but taught to accept it."

"Tea tree oil. I've used it on spots, itchy scalp, fungal infection (ringworm), and add it to my washing detergent to prevent mildew when it's drying (my apartment is really damp). I've also added it to hot water and inhaled it as a cold remedy. Apparently it's also great for the air in your home, so I've bought an oil burner to try this out. "
"For my last few birthdays I've taken the day off of work, stayed in bed reading until about noon, ordered tons of sashimi (take out, so I don't have to change out of pajamas and I barely have to talk to anyone), and played video games/watched Netflix until my husband came home to take me out to dinner."
"Not sure if it's related for certain or not, but I've noticed that when I get interviewed for a job by a woman, I usually don't get hired. When I get interviewed by a man, I'm usually offered a position. 

The only exception to the rule really is that I worked as a nanny for a while, so I was getting interviewed by moms a lot for that. You'd think that might be an issue, but I decided to sort of specialize in nanny jobs where the mom worked from home and was in the house with me all day. So that's not the same environment as a typical nanny job with both parents gone and nanny potentially alone with the father at some point."
"I work in a shop that sells nice underwear and sex toys (it's a high street chain.) I expect dumb jokes and people being weird, and we're encouraged to stand up for ourselves if it crosses a line, but the number of men who will ask inappropriate questions about my sex life while their wives and girlfriends are right next to them is ridiculous. Luckily they usually get yelled at by said wives and girlfriends for being gross.

The worst one was the guy who came in looking for a present for his girlfriend who asked if I could give a demonstration of a new vibrator for him on myself. He got such a death glare that he very quickly apologised and didn't say anything like it again."
Mr. Rochester is rather repugnant. A history of locking mentally ill wives in attics does not a handsome bachelor make.
"I'm not Arab but I'm married to an Arab man hence my last name is very Arabic. I get asked things such as ""is he really controlling"",  ""do you have to walk behind him"",  ""does he know anyone in Isis"" or because he's from Saudi we get ""oh must be rich off all that oil money!""  That's a no to all questions! "
"My husband called me ""Bae"" once ironically and I thought it was funny, so I called him that in response not long after. Fast forward about a year or so...now we just call each other ""Bae"".  I know, I know...it just sort of happened, okay?  😐"

"That's AWESOME! I have long red hair that I used to wear in a side braid at work (I waited tables for several years) and I had little girls telling me I look like a Disney princess every so often.Anna and Repunzel! It made my LIFE!! They would get really shy and say, ""You look like someone on the television!"" before admitting that I remind them of a cartoon character. 

How kids react to long hair is easily one of the best parts of having it. "
"When no one's home, I act. Mostly improv of dramatic scenes, like angry, shocked, depressed, or devastated. When I'm not gaming or working on something, I'm acting."
"Note that some of these are not EXPECTATIONS, but rather good signs that this person is genuinely interested in you! Here are my green flags:

1. They make time for you; he doesn't blow off dates or only wants to see you at late hours. He genuinely likes to spend time with you and does not make it complicated.


2. They respect your boundaries and space. They don't push you to do things that you're not comfortable with doing. I remember the first time things were getting physical with my SO he always said ""is this okay?"" before moving on to something new. It was awesome.


3. They display random acts of kindness with no expectations of anything in return. They bring you flowers, open the door for you, give you small gifts. They just want to make your life a little brighter and that brings them joy.


4. They are very in tune and comfortable with themselves. They are confident, not insecure. They know who they are, and their actions aren't driven by what other people may think of them. And if they like themselves, there's a good chance that they will like you for you too :)"

"oh! i just remembered that Hey There Delilah was an actual, in the flesh Nice Guy song. as in, there was a real Delilah the song was dedicated to, and she was kinda creeped out. dude talked to her once at a party, jokingly said he'd write a song about her, and there it was. she had a boyfriend and still does."

"So I just called my dad. Apparently he's a big fat liar, making me a big fat liar. He just didn't think I'd ever ask for his recipe. The crusts are not homemade as he has previously claimed, but they're a rice flour frozen crust he gets from a health food store. He said they should be available at Whole Foods, Sprouts, or Trader Joe's as well."
"Someone once hit on my while in line for the bathroom at a bar. Not great, but not the worst. What makes it really awkward is that after I politely turned him away, he then went and found my friends, sat down, and told them how hot I was. My boyfriend went ""I... Think you're describing my girlfriend?"" At which point he was like ""oh lol, you're so lucky"" and then sat down at joined them. So when I came back from the bathroom, there he was at our table. It was hella awkward and he didn't leave despite is directly asking him to, and almost came home with us.

Other awkward times: patients or family members hitting on my as I'm providing them care. One hit on my as I was actively holding his penis in a urinal. Another said to me ""do you bring in male nurses when a female patient needs to wash her pussy"" or something to that effect as I was giving him him a bed bath. Lovely."
I thought that was the point they were making.
Seriously? Wtf? What was the purpose behind this?
"I do know some other places do something similar this, but in my culture there's a longstanding tradition called a wedding social (it has other names elsewhere). 

The concept is that it raises money for the couple to pay for their wedding.

Basically, at some point prior to your wedding (usually the winter before), you rent out a cheap social hall, buy a huge amount of booze and rent a DJ. 

You and your wedding party and family sell tickets to the event. Anyone can come, you don't need to know the couple, and so the age range is pretty diverse. I've been to wedding socials for people I didn't know at all. 

So a few hundred people show up, and you all get absolutely blotto with someone's 90-year-old grandma on $4 rye and cokes in plastic cups, and dance. 

(There are a bunch of songs that are basically mandatory at a wedding social: Boot Scootin' Boogie, Brown Eyed Girl, I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles), etc.) 

Then there's a silent auction; companies donate prizes, or sometimes the couple buys a more expensive item hoping to generate a profit on ticket sales. 

So you buy a ton of tickets to win a new BBQ or spa package or whatever. At midnight there is a meal that traditionally consists of rye bread, cheese cubes, kielbasa sausage and pickles. 

I know there are versions of this in various cultures, but a lot of people who aren't familiar with it think it's tacky. What can I say, my people are practical people, we like to have fun and weddings are expensive."
Edward from Twilight is a glorified domestic abuser. My blood BOILS whenever I think of him and all the ways in which he manipulates a teenage girl (when he is something like a 90-year-old-man) to basically do the opposite of what she wants. And his family is just made out of enablers who reinforce his abuse in different ways. 
"I'll be there and also live in the area. A few things for the out-of-towners to know about getting around:

* Public transit around here is the [Metro](https://www.wmata.com/). Even if you drove in you should probably use the Metro because parking downtown is a nightmare of expense and availability. Especially with a big event like this going on.

* Federal Center SW is the closest Metro station (subway) to where the march is happening, but L'Enfant Plaza and Capitol South are almost as close.

* The bus costs a flat $1.75 in cash (no change given) or using a SmarTrip card you can get from any Metro station. The Metro only accepts the SmarTrip card.

* A SmarTrip card is reusable and can be purchased and reloaded at any Metro station using cash, credit, or debit.

* The Metro charges based on what station you entered and which you left from. Every station has a chart showing the cost to go to every other station. Plan accordingly when loading your SmarTrip card.

* With a major event going on, the trains will be packed as they get near the event. There tends to be more space towards the ends of the train as everyone on the platform will generally try to board the middle.

* The Metro closes at midnight, so be where you want to be by then or be ready to use Uber.

That's pretty much it. Just follow the mob and you should get there just fine. I'd offer couch space to crash on but I'm full up as is. Hope y'all make it here and back okay and have a good experience. If there are any other questions, hopefully me or another local can answer.

Edit: Forgot to mention, the Metro describes which direction trains on the lines are going by the end station in that direction. For instance if I'm trying to get to L'Enfant Plaza from Virginia on the Yellow line, I'm going to get the train going towards Fort Totten, not Huntington. When planning your route be aware of that, though if you see more people going one way, that is probably a good hint."

"Aria and Ezra from Pretty Little Liars. Shes in like, 10th grade right when they start dating? Even so he's been through college and a serious relationship with a grown woman so he's gotta be 23+. I don't remember all the small details. All I know is looking back as a 22 year old, I can't imagine dating a 15 year old. Yuck. I mean I'll still root for them in fantasy land but in real life it's gross haha. "

"Buffy and Angel or Spike.  

Though really any time a vampire falls for a teen.  That's just the most notable example I remember watching when I was younger.

Buffy's mother comments that Angel is too old for her even based on his mid-twenties appearance and how he acts.  I thought about it and when they sleep together she's 16 and he's hundreds of years old.... that's pretty inappropriate.  Then later he claims he has the self control to deal with it and is able to not continue their relationship.  Where was that self control before?  And, of course, Angel could always have waited for Buffy to get older and mature, given how he doesn't ""age"".

When she is with Spike at least she's older/more mature at that point, but Spike is sort of a known abuser so that's weird too.  In earlier seasons Spike talks about tying up and beating up Dru to make her love him again, heck he almost rapes Buffy, but then Buffy goes on to be with him?"
"At the end of the book she leaves him for being a piece of shit, so that was nice. I just choose to pretend there was only one."
"That kind of makes me remember in elementary school, I had a gym teacher who would have a girl do a handstand (with him holding her legs) and he'd ALWAYS look down at the crotch.  I forgot about it until in high school I caught up with an elementary school friend and he told me about that.  Scary thing is, he's still there... "
"Not sure why I am sharing this story but I kind of want to.

First let me say you are right some places are helping parents abuse their children by keeping them in a program they do not need.

Now story time. I worked in a place that was kind of a respite for parents with troubled teenagers.  They could stay for 48 hours till they went home or figured out where else to go. A lot of foster kids between homes would come to us (they could stay longer). Anyways one family (not foster) would abuse the system. They had a good teenager, really good kid but they would bring him in say he did something wrong and then go on vacation. Well we found this out after the third time. We also found out he was being abused. Told DCFS, he could not be removed from house. After that we told the family he could stay as long as he wanted. They would leave him for more then a week at a time. We also told him he could come for the afternoon after school if he wanted which he did frequently. I remember sitting down with him and doing homework (me university him highschool). He graduated,  almost our whole staff showed up. He moved away to university and I heard he graduated. 

Anyways I guess I am just proud to have worked for an organization that cared more about a kid then the policy. "

"I *tried* to date someone who was perfect on paper, but I wasn't attracted to him. I figured I wasn't repulsed by him and he seemed awesome, so we dated.

For us, it was awful. It turned downright toxic. We didn't click emotionally, and that caused so many problems - he never understood my issues or took me seriously (I truly believe he just never comprehended how serious boundaries were to me) and I felt constantly disrespected; he, in turn, felt constantly disrespected because he felt judged and like I was always fighting with him.

I have never been more relieved in my life than when we broke up. I regret not doing it sooner. I could have saved us both a lot of pain."
Because I was 12 and he was a strung-out homeless man I had never seen before.
"YES. When I first saw that, too, I got really upset about him cheating on her, too. 

Then I re-watched it years later. The reason they go on a 'break' in the first place is because he didn't trust her to not fuck her co-workers. He actively shows up at her office in order to verify that she's not having an affair. Forget the copy girl. That possessiveness is the real deal-breaker."
"So, I'm a relatively attractive girl and I'm used to guys complimenting me on my looks when they first get to know me. 

The guy I've just started talking to and I were playing the flirty 20 questions game and I asked him to describe me in one word. I was expecting pretty or something of that ilk, and he said ""enchanting."" I kinda teased him for being cheesy and he replied ""I think it says more about you than just your looks, even though you're gorgeous, too.""

DEFINITELY a green flag. "

"I think by the end, he had definitely learned that his own personal growth was way more important than just trying to seduce women, and in bettering himself, he actually became more attractive to Rita.  That's why I love the movie, because he stopped trying to be selfish and learned to become an all-around better person.  But before he did that, it always seemed to me like he spent a while being deceptive and didn't have the best intentions."
"I had the 30 something year old head cook of my job ask me if I was shaved, privately through text message. He was always inviting me over too. I was 15-16 during that time. 

It was at a retirement home and boy do those men have some entitlement. I was sitting in a chair taking down the menu board once and a 90 year old tapped me on the shoulder and I looked over and he kissed me on the lips. He stank like alcohol. 

Fuck that place. "

"Remind yourself that mental health issues aren't a moral failing - rather, they are diseases.

Mental diseases are still legitimate diseases and they are not your fault!"
"My mom loves being a martyr, so she would tell everyone how poor we were. My teachers, her boss, all our friends and family, everyone. If someone asked us to go out to dinner or a movie or a day at the beach she would straight up tell them we couldn't afford it, instead of just politely declining. It was humiliating, especially because we weren't actually that poor. We were by no means well off, but we werent starving. She just used that as an excuse to never let me leave the house or buy me new clothes or literally anything else I wanted or needed. 

In addition to that, she would never accept any kind of help or charity, because it was more important to her that she be seen as a suffering, hardworking mother than making sure we were actually taken care of. She basically wanted everyone to know we were struggling, just so they could watch and feel sorry for her."

"When I was a kid, I was really into this movie called Banjo the Woodpile Cat. There was a scene in which Banjo's father instructed him to find a ""switch."" I had to ask my dad what it meant, and he explained it was a stick for spanking. I thought this was HILARIOUS for some reason, and I always wanted my dad to pretend to spank me and I would just giggle.

My family also would playfully tickle each other, because my mom and I are both very ticklish.  

One day (according to my parents-I don't remember this) we were in a park with other families and kids and my parents were talking to other grownups, and I found a good switch and started yelling ""SPANK ME, DADDY! TICKLE ME AND SPANK ME!"" Allegedly, my parents were absolutely mortified. Good times."

"I hate how on Reddit every time there's an article about women in Saudi Arabia being treated as second-class citizens and forced to wear the veil the comment section is always filled with ""anti-feminists"" and ""anti-SJWS"" bashing Western feminists and acting as if sexism, rape, and domestic abuse is non-existent in the West.

"I was 16, working as a waitress. This older guy came in during an event funded by the red cross for a certain group of people, I'm not sure what exactly it was though. Basically, we were kind of doing in-house catering. So I after I get his drink (with it still in my hand I guess?), I ask if I can get him anything else and he grabs my wrist and says ""Can I keep the holder?""

I had no idea what he meant and the dude had fucking grabbed my wrist, so I was like ""Do you mean like a takeout drink holder?"" and internally flipping shit, and he said ""No, I meant you."" I was freaked the fuck out so I half-laughed and said ""Oh haha sorry no can do"" and booked it to the kitchen and told my supervisor what happened. She said she would take over for me so that I could stay back there and roll silverware so I wouldn't have to talk to the guy anymore. Love that woman.

A bit later the same day, he did the same thing to a waitress even younger than me!! So my supervisor went into mama bear mode and told the guy that touching and hitting on the underage waitresses was inappropriate and if he continued making the employees uncomfortable he would have to leave.  I'm honestly surprised she didn't kick him out immediately, but she wasn't a manager so I assume it would have been against policy."

"God yes. I seriously baffles me how much, ""Always,"" is seen is the quintessential HP quote. (Much less all of the stag and doe tattoos I see floating around with that quote. They know James, the owner of the stag patronus, didn't say that...right?)

Snape harbored an unrequited love and came from a less than ideal home, oh so tragic, but this man was knowingly participating in a racial cleansing movement. He didn't give a single solitary damn about anyone besides Lily. He used his authoritative status to verbally and physically terrorize multiple children for years with zero remorse or self inflection concerning his own shitty upbringing as a childhood outcast.

 His great redeeming arc stems out of his begrudgingly protecting the child of the woman he creepily pined after because he had no alternative means of retaliation against the individual that killed her, all while taking pleasure in tormenting the child at every opportunity.

I appreciate his sacrifices, but they were all and *always* self serving and done to absolve himself of the truly disgusting actions of his past while still indulging in petty and vile behavior in the mean time. "

"I'm an Arab (Syrian, Turkish, Armenian along with German) but look like I'm Irish. My dad is from Syria and grew up Christian but *EVERYONE* fucking assumes he's Muslim.  

I have light eyes and freckles but whenever someone sees my last name (I'm in the process of changing it) the stares and questions come rolling in. I've had people think it's funny to ask me if I know how to make bombs and whether I'm a terrorist. I'm almost embarrassed when my dad speaks Arabic when we're out in public because people are so ignorant and dumb. "
"My boyfriend yesterday, for no reason: You are a wonderful and amazing person who I'm so very very blessed to know. You've accomplished incredible and difficult achievements, and you work so hard to consistently improve yourself. Eres un inspiratión!"
He said all that *in front of your mom*?!?!  So he's creepy and stupid. 
"My stepfather (at that time boyfriend) was somehow able to see my nipples and outline of my breasts in my shirt. And, of course, he commented on shape and size and color and how inappropriate I look. While my mom stood there and agreed with him. And then critiqued my breasts some more, in case I wasn't disgusted enough, and told me to change. Have been self-conscious to wearing white tops ever since."
"Yeah, I'd only ever been asked out one time.

There was a boy at my school who had asked a few of my friends out, but it was the typical shitty high school thing where he'd ask a girl out and then when she got excited he'd start laughing and say ""Yeah right, I'd *never* go out with you!""

I'd seen him do it to friends before, so when he asked me out I said no. He got really upset, which made me realize he may have been genuinely asking, but it wasn't worth the risk to me - I didn't want him and his friends all laughing at me. 

It's possible he started a rumor after that, I guess. As far as I know I'm the only one who ever told him no, so maybe he told people it was just because I didn't date."

"I gave up my free ride to a very good university out of state to attend state uni night classes and raise/nanny my youngest sibling during the day while my mother worked, after my too-poor-for-daycare single parent of six mother got knocked up at 40 (yeah, antibiotics can mess up your birth control), and chose not to have an abortion. 

Both the best and worst thing I did."

"My best friend grew up in a very strict family. His freshman year in HS he had to go into school early to clean blackboards to offset his tuition. He'd get sleepy before the school day was done, so he started buying Vivarin. When he got caught by his parents they sent him to an in-patient treatment center.  There they found out that he wasn't addicted to some street drug, but just had a fucked up home life, so they did counseling/treatment for that. When he was released a month later he found that his parents put all his furniture and belongings in the garage and installed a shower out there because he was ""dirty and not allowed in the house"". They day he graduated from HS he moved in with me and my family. "

"I remember reading a YA book about a teen girl liking a guy (pretty cutting edge stuff, right?). I don't remember much else other than they made out and told her they had to stop and she asked why, and he took her hand and stuck it his cum that he had freshly deposited all over his sheets. 
She didn't seem to mind and neither did 13 year old me, I guess. Now it sounds like something I would read on a ""worst Tinder date ever"" thread. 

I also remember reading a book about a young cop that forced a delinquent girl to ride around with him for a few days as punishment for breaking the law. They ended up falling in love. Can't believe I found that messed up dynamic to be dreamy. "

"But let's be legit about that too: 

The last petals fall from the rose on his 21st birthday. And when we go from the stained glass intro to Belle in the village, it says ""10 Years Later"". 

So what we really have is a stranger asking to come into this 11 year old boy's house, him saying ""Uh, no"", and her going ""AHA I AM AN ENCHANTRESS"" and him being like ""Oh shit please don't curse me"" and she's like ""TOO LATE!""

I mean... wouldn't you want your 11 year old to turn away a stranger? "

Feeling beautiful and womanly in a mature way.  This is deeper and beyond being sexy or hot or girly. 
"Why some seem to think we don't understand men, when we're socialized to understand men more than other women

But even that I kind of understand, since women are othered an men probably think they don't get women because were a different gender, and not because there's a severe lack of women's perspectives in the cultural medium around us"
"I can't believe how much we got away with in the early 2000s. I never got carded when I was 13/14 and buying alcohol, cigarettes, sex toys, weed. We would smoke right in front of the school and go to bars and buy huge-ass dildos at sex shops. 

Once we passed through the Red Light District and this guy was trying to get us to come in for a live sex show. We were 14, but my friend looked about 12, and he said, ""The baby gets in for half price!""

Then one year they started being really strict with ID for cigarettes and alcohol. And now they have ""age coins"" for cigarette machines, and introduced a weed pass for coffee shops (but not sure if that's still around). "
"If you wear seasonally inappropriate clothing (e.g., cargo shorts in January in Pittsburgh), you are an absolute donut. I don't care if you ""just don't get cold."" It's 13F and blowing snow, and you are a lying liar who tells lies.

"And, well, he tries to do the right thing about it. He has her transferred so he isn't her boss when he realizes he can't get over it. I mean, in an ideal world he would get over it, but he tried to handle it as well as he could. He didn't like, fire her, or sexually harass her. And then when he does make a move, its at her invitation, when he hasn't been her boss for a while. I don't know, it isn't an ideal situation, but it isn't outright creepy. "
"A friend told me that ""everyone text and drives.  If you deny it then you are lying.""

My dad died from a distracted driving car crash.  It really hurt in ways that I don't think they knew.  It hurt that they might be right and it hurt worse that they thought it was ok to text and drive."

"So I have been dating my SO for more than three years and I've been tweezing nipple hairs like once a week this whole time, except about a month ago I slipped up and he noticed when we were lying in bed.

"&gt;Another issue from my early 20s - I think that people assume that when you're pretty, you're also extroverted/ very social. I'm very introverted...

I had a similar issue but I think it led people to believe I was stuck-up and aloof. I didn't get fat and the attention still dwindled throughout my 20s - I think part of it is that we all grow up, and also strangers are less likely to pick on me than a 16 year old because creepy control reasons."

I didn't want to marry him. I was only 16 (he was around 24) and he wanted me to give up college to be his wife because he was rich and his family thought that I could be trained to be a very appropriate society wife. I had no intention of marrying him and the fact that he wanted to change everything about me and take away my dreams certainly didn't help his cause.

"Apparently no one's mentioned it yet, but Ron and Hermione. Seemed really cute at first til I realised Ron is... not that great. He projects a lot of his insecurities onto Hermione and always seems jealous when she succeeds.

He also, well into his teens, seems to subscribe to the stereotype that boys ""are only mean to you because he likes you"". Most of the cute interactions he has with Hermione are him apologising for something bad he's done. He's just really not nice to Hermione for the most part."

"I'm a teacher who is reasonably attractive.... It sucks. I teach English to adults, and am often the first American woman that my students come into close contact with (my younger students anyway). 

With stereotypes of American women being easy (and American teachers sleeping with students) I need to constantly put up with advances from my students. I get new students every week because of open enrollment, so it happens at least once every two weeks or so.  Most of them are harmless but some of them are very sexual explicit or vulgar. 

I have to be especially careful of the clothing I wear to work so that it doesn't accentuate my butt or bust.  I also spend a large chunk of my time writing student incident reports and attending meetings when I could be lesson planning. And it's hurt my relationship with other students because I'm afraid to get too close/friendly in case they go too far. "

"My inlaws are the only Trump supporters I've interacted with in real life, who I know for a fact support Trump and voted for him.

About Trump?  They basically refuse to talk about any flaws Trump may have, though Pence's comments that smoking doesn't kill made my mother in law, a nurse, visibly uncomfortable.  Mostly they just say any negative statements about Trump are wrong and act like you're an idiot for worrying about things like racism or sexism or whatever else.  One of the statements my husband said is that he doesn't believe Trump is a good person, and they disagreed, they think he is a good person.

However, in general, I'm not surprised.  They're not really people who I align with on anything.  My inlaws are racist, but will verbally tell you they are not.  My inlaws are sexist, but will verbally tell you they are not.  My inlaws believe and will tell you that poor people deserve it and should just work harder.  They believe that same sex couples should be something that we just don't talk about.  They believe very strongly in fake-Christianity - the type where you get to judge others and pretend to be saved."

"Oh yeah, totally. Either her or my dad rang the police because I had to give a description of him/testify to them a little bit later on. The WTF moment was more the fact that she found it more important to keep up appearances (not an isolated incident, hence why it annoys me now but I admit it doesn't seem that bad when I didn't provide much context)."
"Mine wasn't as bad as you but my mum was very insistent I ate my cereal with lots of milk every morning. The resulting tummy ache was apparently nerves about going to school. When I found out I'm dairy intolerant, not till my teens, she was horrified. But still thought I would wither and die if I didn't drink milk. I mean seriously, so many people seem to think milk is 100% essential, to the point of making people have it even if it makes them sick! I don't even eat breakfast any more as it has too many negative connotations. "
Mushrooms are fungus and should not be eaten.  I can't even stand the smell of them.
"Back when I was single I sort of learned to manipulate the situation. So, my one hot friend could get a little mean/princess-y when she drinks, so I overplayed the role of the concerned, cute, nice girl. It worked for me because I usually would end up attracting the nice-looking wingman who's probably a better catch. 

I did have my victory when once at a bar when the bartender looked at us and said ""so how does this work - she's (my friend) the mean one and you're (me) the hot one?"" Ego boost for sure, haha"
"My SO is all about quality time and physical touch, both receiving and expressing. I love spending quality time with him but I also value words of affirmation and receiving gifts. I am definitely not naturally physically affectionate.

Before I read about this love languages thing, I remember feeling a little discontent because my SO never really gave me compliments or said 'I love you' unprompted, plus I'd get all these spontaneous gifts for him and never got anything back. But after reading more about this topic and talking to my SO, I realised he was expressing his love for me through physical touch - all the cuddling, holding my hand, leaning on me, making me lie on his lap etc. That was all his way of expressing love. Being more conscious of it and understanding that's how he displays his affection, it made me realise just how affectionate he was!

And I brought up my discontent as well so my SO has worked hard to give me more compliments, say I love you unprompted, and puts way more effort into gift exchanges now. Knowing my SO enjoyed physical affection as well, I worked hard on being more physically affectionate."
"Some people are hopeless. I own a small business baking gourmet cheesecakes. In November, my best friend's husband died very unexpectedly. I organized the memorial service and was orchestrating a lot of things so she didn't have to deal with the logical stuff. Not to mention, he was one of my closest friends as well. 

While at the funeral, I was standing at the front of the church talking to a few people and giving direction. A mutual friend came up and tried to order a Thanksgiving cheesecake from me. I politely told him to place an order through my site or at least text me, but he ignored me. It took all of my self control to not tell him to fuck off. "

"I was raised by my grandparents and only lived with my mom and dad on the weekends. The logic for this was that my parents had to get to work by 730 and, since I went to private school, would have to drop me off super early and wouldn't get to pick me up until pretty late. Grandparents were retired and lived closer to school so they dropped off and picked up. So we lived there Sunday night to Friday evening. At least until my freshman year of high school, then we got to move to my parents house full time. 

Never thought of it as weird until more recently. Because, from what I remember, my parents didn't visit during the week and never really called. So it was literally just the weekend. 

And we're talking about them living the next town over kind of mode, so maybe 20 minutes driving. Thinking back it's super weird. "
Totally agree with this. It's hard to form meaningful business relationships and take advantage of networking opportunities because this tends to happen a lot for women.

""No. This is some trick. It's him, it's my... my lord, my sweet lord, he sent you, this is just some test to make sure that I love him. I do, I do, I love him more than anything."" A tear ran down her cheek. 

""Tell him, you tell him. *I'll do what he wants... whatever he wants... with him or...or the dog or... please...* he doesn't need to cut my feet off, I won't try to run away, not ever, I'll give him sons, I swear it, I swear it...""

Very few things have ever made physically wretch while reading be they based in fiction or real life events, but this was one of them."
"I didn't know then... But almost immediately after talking to him. I was 3 months widowed and he was 9 months widowed. And only 9 months older than me. He was the first person I had talked to that knew exactly what I was going through. It was the calmest and most at ease I had been since I lost my husband. We talked on the phone for hours and we only got off the phone so he could drive to my house at 3am to meet me in person. As cheesy as it sounds, it was like everything had been black and white after I lost James, but when Justin walked through my door I saw the bluest eyes I've ever seen. After talking literally all night, after he left for work, I knew I would never find another person that understood what I had been through. I knew I had to hold on to him and never let him go. 

Almost every day after that night we saw each other. He became my absolute best friend. And 9 months later he asked me to be his girlfriend. He told me he loved me a few days later. I waited 2 whole days after that to say it back. But when I told him I let him know that I had loved him for a very long time. 

A week ago he proposed. I never believed in soul mates before I met him. Not even with my husband of 8 years. Justin is my soul mate. I honestly believe we were meant to be together, we just had to be with our late spouses first.  "

"I think I'm pretty attractive, I used to model, and I'm naturally small/thin/in my early 20's. 

Sadly, I've gotten most of the bad treatment from fellow women. I currently work as a waitress, and I've had female customers glare at/stiff me on tips because they thought I was flirting with their partner (it's my JOB to smile and be friendly, I don't want your guy!) I've gone out with my guy friends and had their exes/girlfriends be awful to me, assuming that I was there because I was interested in dating said guy, meanwhile I thought of them as brothers. I've had people make comments that I only got a job or recognition for my work because of the way I looked...

Guys have said some shit too, though. I've been called just a pretty face/an airhead/bimbo/a tease because I was wearing a short skirt but wasn't interested in being hit on them at the bar. Pretty lame."
"It was definitely wildly inappropriate. I feel it may have been done in the wake of the grief, death can really fuck with people's' heads. If the man who died was his best friend he may have been trying to make some connection with someone who was close to someone very dear he lost, find a common ground in tragedy. Selfish, thoughtless, and inappropriate, but potentially understandable to a degree. "

Some days I really don't want to go to work or the gym, cook a healthy dinner, even shower or brush my teeth but I always do because that's all part of my routine. Most of the time I feel pretty good about my job or exercising because I do legitimately enjoy those things, but when I don't feel like doing them then discipline is what gets me through.

If you're not motivated because you truly hate your job or your situation then you need to take steps to change that."

"That Arab women don't deserve the same human rights as everyone else. Like when a German judge denied a Moroccan woman a divorce from her abusive husband because domestic violence is just part of Arab culture, so what else could the woman expect? [Seriously.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/23/germany.islam) The judge referred to the ""Moroccan cultural environment in which it is not uncommon for a man to exert a right of corporal punishment over his wife...That's what the claimant had to reckon with when she married the defendant.""

Also re. Arab culture more broadly, the total ignorance of any kind of diversity in the Middle East, whether ethnic, religious, cultural, or topographical/climatic. (To take one small example, [this picture](http://i40.tinypic.com/30j0ig0.jpg) is from southwest Saudi Arabia.) As if Lebanon is the same as Saudi Arabia, which is the same as Egypt, which is the same as Yemen, and on and on -- just one indistinguishable mass of sand and terrorists. I doubt even 10% of Americans have the faintest idea that not everyone in the Middle East is Arab (even within Arab countries), not all Arabs are Muslim, and the vast majority of all Muslims are not Arab."

"" Ehhhhh would we call her chubby?""
""I think there's a pretty sizeable arse there, yes, sir. Huge thighs.""


I suppose it is supposed to be creepy because he is a man of authority, lusting for someone underneath him. But that dynamic bothers me less than others being mentioned in this thread. "
Black and white fur. Two horns. 
"I get catcalled / honked at a lot. I know this happens to a lot of women, but it just happens to me so frequently and I'm constantly worried about my safety. The other day I took a 15 min walk and in that time I got honked at twice and a guy got out of his car at a red light to ask me if I needed a ride. It just makes me scared sometimes. I'd just like to be able to take a nice walk without worrying about that kind of thing.

People definitely underestimate my intelligence as well. It rubs me the wrong way when people act all surprised that I'm actually smart. 

Having straight male friends is tough. My closest friends are women or gay men. I have some straight guy friends but usually they end up hitting on me at some point or another. I shoot it down but some of them still hold out a little hope. I have one pretty good straight guy friend and I think the only reason we can be that way is because we established early on we aren't interested in one another romantically. I don't like to buy stock into the idea that straight men and women can't be friends but it's hard not to think that it's nearly impossible if the man is attracted to the woman at this point in my life after it's happened so often.

In terms of career, it hasn't been a hindrance yet. My boss and co-workers are all women. I'm changing fields soon though so we'll see how that goes..."
My MIL got hit on at her husband's funeral. By his brother. It was gross. 
"I just finished season 5 of Gossip Girl. I hate him, but I also hate every other character. They always find more ways to be shitty lol."
I don't like meat with a single hint of pink in it. Well done always.
Food budgeting?. My dad used to yell at me (including in front of friends) if I raided the fridge because he had all the meals planned and I was disrupting his plans by eating things at random. 
"Yeah, for a while. I really wasn't worth dating. I had nothing to offer, couldn't give nearly as much as I wanted to take. I worked hard on improving myself and having more to give. It included a bunch of therapy and getting hobbies and interests outside the TV and Internet.

Tbh I feel like more people should take a hard look at themselves and see how much they really have to offer in a relationship, instead of feeling entitled to one even when they have few things to offer anyone. 
That doesn't include people who just have low self esteem, but even then, if you don't think you have much to offer, you probably won't offer much anyway because you'll be so wrapped up in your own self-esteem issues. It's like the advice that when people tell you they're not worth it or that you're too good for them, trust them."
"Yupp, Jeyne Poole. The daughter of the steward of Winter fell and Sansa's best friend growing up. 

She was forced to pretend to be Arya Stark when she married Ramsay Bolton in order to help secure his father's position as Warden of the North."
Like if Rachel Maddow and Hannah Hart had an overweight 25-year-old baby
"I met a guy the other day who legitimately believed that women and men can't ""just"" be friends. 

I told him that I think I have almost as many female friends as male, I've never slept with any of them, and I would never try. 

He actually looked me in the face and said I was lying, either to him or to myself. 

I felt really sorry for him. "
"Warning to readers: coconut oil is highly comedogenic. If it comes near my hair or skin, I get the worst breakouts ever"
"A few years ago a good guy friend of mine got really drunk one night and ended up confessing his love for me. I didn't feel the same for him (I'm gay and he knew that) but when I gently told him that he got extremely angry, bringing up every nice thing he'd ever done for me – gone to the Apple store with me when my computer broke, going grocery shopping with me, getting lunch for me once (I paid him back), and so on... He kept saying ""I did so much for you! How could you not love me? You're killing me! It's not fair!"" I told him that I thought we were just pals– friends help each other out! 

We had class together the next day and in the middle of a lecture he sent me a text saying ""I know you want me."" After class I told him in no uncertain terms that his text was extremely inappropriate, and he started going on about how ""you think you don't love me but you do. Stop denying it."" I had to cut off our friendship after that. Unfortunately he told a lot of people that I'd stomped on his heart and for a while I had a bit of a reputation as a ""cold bitch"". "
"I've said for years that I don't like Italian food, always negotiate to go to a different restaurant if someone suggests an Italian one, etc...

Then last month my husband's company dinner was at an Italian joint and so many things looked great. Chicken Marsala, a butternut squash ravioli in a brown butter sage sauce, frutti del mar (seafood pasta in a white wine and olive oil sauce), various gnocchi dishes, etc...

I think I actually love Italian food. I just don't like tomato sauce."
I initially read it as your step father was your boyfriend at the time. Thank all that is holy I re-read your post.
"When I was in second grade, my parents took me to get my eyes tested because my grades harshly fell once my teacher placed me in the back of the classroom (my last name almost always placed me in the front row throughout elementary school).

Got an eye exam and they found out that my vision was worse than my parents'.  The first thing I screamed (not said) was ""MAAAAAHHHM.  THERE ARE LEAVES ON THE TREES.  DID YOU KNOW THAT????""

I screamed it in the doctor's office and my parents were mortified that they had let me go so long without glasses and that everyone in the office knew it too."
I wish women's pants were sold by measurements like men's pants instead of arbitrary numbers that vary even among the same freaking brand. 
With socks. My feet get cold easily. I don't like when my skin feels like ice.
"That was always the line from the intro that bugged me: ""who could ever learn to love... a beast?""

Dammit, this is supposed to be about him learning not to be a shitty person who has no empathy, not about *her* learning to love *him*. She's fine. He got cursed by a witch for being a B hole."
I love the characterisation of him from a literary perspective. But he is the actual worst.

"When I was 21, during the 2012 election. Everyone was arguing about birth control and abortions, and I realized that because I'm a woman, strange men who know nothing about my reproductive system get to make decisions about it. It was the first time I ever felt like there was a downside to being a woman."
"Tangerine and Joel from the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In the past, I idealized or romanticized their relationship--that they were meant to be together, opposites attract, they were always fighting, and even through erasing their memories they always end up finding each other all over again. Today I realized just how fucked up their relationship was--and I would never want to be stuck in a vicious cycle like that. I also read recently about the true intentions of the director or writer was actually pretty dark, nihilistic, and depressing. I guess I used to be a hopeless romantic and viewed that as true love but today I think it's quite toxic...

EDIT: Omg I died of laughter after realizing that I'd put Tangerine instead of Clementine!!! XD Thanks guys for catching my mistake! It was and still is one of my favorite movies though and I've watched it so many times yet still called her Tangerine!"
"Is this really an unpopular opinion?

I feel like the Pumpkin Spice trend is mocked mercilessly and anyone who enjoys is considered ""basic""."
Some of them are okay people (they were more anti-Hillary than pro-Trump and they're feeling some regret right now). The others say some really backwards shit... Many are also bullies who never left the middle school mentality behind. 
"My boy best friend in grade school told me we couldn't be friends anymore because other kids were taunting him by saying I was his girlfriend.  Totally shattered me.

Also every sport I wasn't allowed to play in school and was relegated to the touch sports or bullshit games ""for girls.""  

At every occasion I was forced to wear a dress.

Every relationship in which I expressed my needs and was called ""crazy"" or ""demanding.""  

"
But not giving you a raise because you're a woman is illegal.
"My mom is also GF and vegan. My dad makes amazing vegan pizza with a GF crust. I'm happy to send you the recipe if you want non-vomit inducing pizza. 

I'm not trying to convert you if you just don't like it, I just thought I'd offer.  "
"Guy #1, we broke up. I just couldn't get past the issue. 

Guy #2, we got married. Uh. I was in a lot of denial about where my feelings were even up till the actual wedding day. Basically, if you're not sure you're ""romantically into"" someone, but the thought of breaking up with them makes you cry hysterically and their mere presence in the room makes you feel better, plus the thought of them with someone else makes you jealous as hell,  you're probably in love with them and also nostrils-deep in denial. 

..... It is completely impossible to avoid mentioning the bit where we didn't have sex before marriage, though, because once we did have sex after the wedding, I became very infatuated with him. 

I have no idea what this same situation would be for someone you're having sex with and yet are still not romantically into. 


Edit: also, I think the advice someone gave me that you eventually stop looking forward to dates if it's a bad match was correct. Guy #1 by the end I was tired of dating him. Not so with husband..."
"I really don't understand people. If I worked in the school or had anything remotely to do with the school and had even the slightest inclination that something like that was going on, the guy would be fired/looked into so goddam quick. Like yesterday, quick. Aren't kids supposed to feel safe at school? I know there's bullying and a lot else that goes on, but I mean c'mon. The faculty is sleazy, too? What a dam shame."
"Also somewhat related-- if you decide you don't want a perishable food item (meat, milk, frozen food), don't just leave it on a random shelf somewhere in the store for some hapless employee to find and have to throw out!"
"Yes, it was my choice to be single. I'm a very solitary person, in general I don't care much for other people, dating sounds like my worst nightmare and I hate physical contact even from family. My life plan didn't include a partner.

I met my SO through a training course, we hung out, we got on better than I ever have with anyone else... and we're still together (I'm 27 now). Getting used to the physical stuff - literally even just holding hands/hugging which I'd never done before - was awkward at first but now I love it. He's great. We're both independent adults, so there's no stupid teenage relationship drama, and while the relationship adds a lot to my life, I also know I could survive if it ended.

So yeah, i don't regret it at all, I'm glad I waited. And I feel kind of proud that I made such a good choice the first time that I (hopefully) never need to choose again!"
"Overboard. As a teenager I thought that it was adorable, as an adult it leaves me going 'wtf. Woman gets amnesia, man convinces her she's his wife and gets her to look after him and his kids... *And* they have sex eventually, which, because she has amnesia and doesn't know the truth, should really be regarded as rape! Then when she remembers it all she's intiailly rightfully pissed off, but in the end forgives and goes back to him. Ugh. 

Also, a lot of romance novels set in the middle ages etc tend to have rape disguised as 'forceful'. "
The words exotic or oriental to describe us. The world is smaller now. We aren't mysterious things from an unknown land.... 
I get in my feelings when people say they're going to do things and then they don't do it. It could be anything as little as them saying they're going to call me later. I just get disappointed when people don't keep their word. 
"I hate when patients do that. They're like a child that I care for and completely non sexual. 

I had a STEMI patient - actively having a heart attack- make a disgusting remark when I was prepping his groin for the heart cath. Bro, I'm the one trying to save your misogynistic ass, could you at least give me some respect now?"
"I was with my first bf for almost a year and never had one with him. It bothered that he always climaxed but I never did. Though what really pissed me off was that it didn't seem to bother him. If I couldn't bring my SO to climax, I'd feel real shitty and insecure. He didn't. 

But when I finally did have an orgasm (with someone else), it was the most amazing feeling EVER! Not just the physical sensations, but also knowing that nothing was wrong with me and that I *could* orgasm."
"I smack around the edge of the lid at an angle with the dull side of a butter knife. Works amazingly well.

Glad you got your jar open!"
Effort.
"Probably when I was 12 and my Aunt chewed me out for not helping with the post-Thanksgiving meal cleanup.

After the meal, the men would go nap and watch sports, or go outside for walks. The kids would go outside and play. All the women would clean up and do dishes and such, and then play a board game. I made the mistake of going outside, but apparently since I'd had a period I was now a woman and meant to be cleaning up, never mind that my 17 year old male cousin got to go out and play with the younger kids."
"If you know what she likes to eat, some groceries would be nice. One time when I was going through a bout of depression my mom brought me some Trader Joe's groceries and it lifted my spirits immensely "
"When I was a young teen, my mother and I were talking about how when we got home I should clean my room, and I said something like, ""You know, I really wish that I was one of those people that liked cleaning.""

And she said, ""No one *likes* cleaning.  They're just more bothered by mess than you are.""

There were so many times throughout my life where I found myself thinking ""Ugh, I don't want to do this, I should do it when I'm in a better mood, I'll do it later, ugh this sucks I'm never going to want to do this, I wish this wasn't so hard for me,"" and remember how she said that.

That feeling of ""This sucks, it doesn't not suck for anyone.  There's no universe where you regularly do this because you want to.  You only get to choose if you want to be a person who never cleans their room/eats right/studies hard, or a person who regularly does things that they don't want to do.""  That has helped me so much throughout my life for so so so many things."
"A 55 year old man who sat next to me on a 2.5 hour flight. He was polite at first, then asked my age and began to make very inappropriate comments about me. I put my headphones in and started reading my book to give the ""don't talk to me"" signs. But he kept tapping my should and saying rude things: how he wish he was my age so he could date me; how I was so mature for my age (21 at the time!); how he wished his girlfriend was as beautiful as me. I grabbed my shit and tried to leave the airport as soon as I could after we landed. I had gone to a far end of the airport to wait for my bus to come, and thought I had escaped him. Then I saw him exit the men's restroom :( He noticed me, ran over, and invited me to grab a drink at the airport bar with him. He kept trying to make conversation until I faked a phone call and went outside to ""catch my bus"" which wasn't due for another 45 minutes. 
 "
"If you're waiting in line to order at a restaurant, you should know what you want to order when it's your turn to order. I don't understand how people can wait in line for 5 minutes and still not know what they want to eat and they don't care that they're holding up the line. I'm hangry! 

I feel the same with people who don't have their tender ready to pay at a store. Like, you know you have to pay for these items and you're just standing there when you should be getting your credit card or cash out. "
Yes! When I was in high school twilight was just starting to get popular (the last book came out when I was a senior) so there were lots of similar paranormal romance series with that guy who was immortal and super powerful (like he had actual supernatural powers) and rich and kind of an asshole and super protective over her and had anger issues and I thought it was the ideal romance scenario. 
"It's not illegal; age-based discrimination only applies to those 40+ -being discriminated against based on your youth is completely legal, just shitty.

"No, it's not the same"
Nah they're racist 
"My ex tried to convince me to get an abortion. I was on birth control. I was really paranoid about getting pregnant and initially I'd asked him to use condoms as well. But he pressured me out of it, said it wasn't fair on him because he couldn't feel as much. 

Anyway, got pregnant. He just assumed I would be having an abortion because I have had one before. I was really annoyed at the assumption. I developed pelvic inflammatory disease after the first abortion and was told that this would put me at risk of infertility and abnormal pregnancies. The abortion also caused a lot of psychological trauma, I lost three years of my life to addiction and eating disorders. 

Since then I have spent a lot of time agonising over whether I would even be able to get pregnant again. So the pregnancy was a shock, but deep down I was relieved. 

I just didn't feel like I could go through another abortion. And I felt like I'd been given a second chance with this baby, and if I didn't have it now I might never be able to. 

I told him, he flipped out. He started suggesting that maybe if I miscarried, I'd feel better about it. He looked up online how I could do it by starvation, physical trauma, drugs. But eventually he caved in. 

Anyway long story short, I gave birth to my daughter. She is the light of my life, the best thing that has ever happened to me. :) Not a single regret. Other than that I should have broken up with her father way sooner than I did. "
"Standard American bread is disgusting. It has the exact texture and mouthfeel of styrofoam. If the entire rest of the planet can figure out how to produce proper crumb - including in crappy industrial bread - you should not have to eat something that looks (and tastes) like it came out of the bottom of a trash compactor, America. 

And holy crap why is half your flippin' bread *sweet*? I'm not 4 years old; I don't need a little sprinkle of sugar on everything to entice me to eat it.  If I wanted my bread to taste sweet, I'd put jam on it or something. Ew ew ew. "
That's a good question. I never asked. 
That's a mean thing to say about vanilla ice cream. 
I lock the door as soon as I come in. It's just habit at this point. We live in a decent area but I don't think my habits would change if I lived somewhere else. There's just no reason to leave it unlocked. 
"I LOVE cucumbers, but cucumber water makes me want to vomit. It is the worst. "
"I work at a Domino's, but after a while you get *really* tired of pizza. 

Domino's only has one way to cook food- a 525 degree oven with a conveyor belt seven minutes long.

My packed lunches are affectionately referred to as 'science experiments' by my coworkers because I try to modify recipes to pay nice with the oven. Sometimes it's delicious, sometimes we end up with a ball of fire moving ever-so-slowly through the oven until it gets to a spot where I can douse it. "
"Omg, it's nice to hear someone else say it. Every job I've gotten was because a man interviewed me. I've never been hired by a woman unless it was a very old woman. Fucking sucks cause it's just waitressing and bar work; I can't imagine if I was actually trying for something major. "
Sexual harassment at work has got to be the worst. Especially because I used to work in food service. The customers know they could potentially get you fired if you don't say/act the way they want you to. They know you're there to serve them so they feel they can get away with just about any kind of sexual harassment like inappropriate comments or following you. So you have to smile and act polite instead of correcting their behavior. It's disgusting. All I want to do is do my job in peace and go home.
"It might be unusual, but a lot of these sound really interesting and fun."
