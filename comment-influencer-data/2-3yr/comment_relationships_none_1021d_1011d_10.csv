"Most people will tease someone about small things or mistakes that they don't see as big deals.

A wrong sized pair of pants is not a big deal 99% of the time. "
"I would give her the numbers for some DV shelters and wish her well. She's the one that chose to ignore the rage, violence, and abusive behavior when it wasn't directed at her, so why should you put yourself in danger to save someone that refused to do the same for you. 

If she does leave and Chad shows up at your door, don't open it. Tell him to get lost because you're calling the cops, and do so while you're actively dialing the phone. He sounds crazy enough to try breaking the door down, so you'll want to have the cops already on the line in case he does."
Is he often this inconsiderate? Does he make plans with you then flake out at the last minute?
"""Passive aggressive"" is pretending to say one thing thing when you clearly mean another. This the opposite of that."
"If you fight you're a violent and psycho person that will hit her at some point. If you didn't fight you disregard her safety and let her get robbed/hit/or worst.

Sorry op, this was a lose-lose situation."
"Don't say anything now. Immediately make an appointment at another clinic. Get the abortion, cancel the old appointment, and then burn bridges. Honestly, I think she's trying to force you to ""do the right thing"". She's going to tell your husband if you don't. Your husband actually scares me, and I think you should take the precaution of getting some money, your important papers, and a bug out bag together and leaving it with someone you can actually trust. You mentioned a brother. Maybe him. That way if SIL rats you out and things go to shit, you can leave quickly. "
"1) I agree your step-dad is a toxic person you need to get far away from 

2) How long until you can move out?  You and your friends can split an apartment much cheaper than renting by yourself. Are you never a city where they have roommate wanted areas?"
Wow... You might try to be a little less self centered and full of teen age angst
He absolutely planned on me taking over the reigns of the business he supported the family with for 20+ years. I feel terrible but I have no intention of operating a tree business in my hometown for the rest of my life.
"&gt; Maybe he panicked and over-reacted.

Yeah, making an 18 year old homeless is normal. Totally not an over-reaction. 

[That was sarcasm.]

&gt; But they most likely do love you more than you can know...until you have children too. 

All the warm feelies matter not a bit if they are not backed by action. Spare me the empty sentimentality of a self justifying parent. "
"Fly fishing, hiking, visit breweries, rafting/kayaking, working on the house (we both owned a house before getting married so that kept us pretty busy).  Pretty much what we do now. Half of my free time is spent doing those things with her and the other half is doing the things I like to do without her.  So 50% of her time is left empty.  "
"Oh yes, indeed. I just like coming to this sub on my own as a commenter from my primary account frequently, and figured this would be a good question to pose to the group. "
"Who hasn't vented in private about an annoying coworker who chats all day/ isn't pulling their weight/ clips their toenails at their desks? Have you honestly never spoken to a friend about a mutual friends partner treating them badly/having abusive behaviours or what not? I can assure you, plenty of decent, good people who are ""actual adults"" have. People are social animals and talking about others is a way of bonding, getting things off their chests or sharing interesting pieces of information with each other.

Also, what's considered 'gossip' and what's considered 'trash talk' is essentially what you deem to be true or not, and the line is not always clear."
"&gt; the fact that this person has effectively admitted that they are actively trying to destroy your relationship

Is that true in this case, though?  It sounds like the guy confessed either before or shortly after OP started dating the woman. Dude may not have even known OP was in the picture at the time of his confession. Not to mention, a confession isn't always a ploy to entice someone away from another relationship. A lot of people feel the need to confess their feelings to get it out in the open and *so that they can move on* because they know their feelings are n't returned, and there are plenty of mature people in this world who can reign in their feelings because they know it's a dick move to go after a man or woman already in a relationship."
"I don't think he actually believes that you aren't sufficiently in shape to care for children. I think he's using it as a bribe to get you in shape for his own attraction-based purposes, or perhaps he's not ready for kids yet and it's the only excuse he can come up with. Or additional theory: he feels out of shape and that he won't be able to take care of the kids and is projecting that onto you.

Whichever one of those it is, it's not about you anymore. You've proven that you can handle the physical challenge toddler TWINS, which is pretty bad-ass. So you're good to go. This is now about him. And I think that it's time to turn the conversation around on him on why he's not ready to start trying."
Omg! I swear this same thing happened to me- (and I didn't make the connection that this kind of thing happens to other people/ was abuse until so many years later) he was the first guy I slept with- and we were together for three years ( he was in the closet with his bisexuality/ homosexual preferences at the time) but he would always like laugh at my attempts to be sexy to my face! It fucked me up for a long time. 
"Shit, or get off the pot. You're saying 35, but you're not even sure you'll want a kid then. Don't ask her to waste her fertile years with you. "
"I want you to sit and think of the implications, here. Would you have dated a married man? He took that choice from you. He lied to his poor wife who thought she was entering the happiest part of her life. He lied to YOU for almost two years!!

People capable of this level of deception are not worth the spit they use to wet their tongues to lie. You'd also be tanking your own reputation as a good person- nobody will believe you didn't know if you stay. You'll be a home wrecker forever, and once this dumpster fire of a relationship is over that will haunt you forever.

Did it ever occur to you that his wife FOUND OUT? That's why he's so eager to start a life with you exclusively now? It's also really horrid that his sister helped him lie to you! Fruit evidently didn't rot too far from the tree.

You deserved better than being a dirty secret. And you deserve better than this man."
"And maybe as a consideration, see if maybe she can be set up with shadowing opportunities once every X weeks with suggested courses of additional self-education so that she may qualify for an entry level role in the future. 

Coursera, Khan, a local General Assembly. Etc. 

Help guide her toward what she needs to know. 

Edit: I assumed software engineer/programming. Because who the hell would think they're qualified for mechanical or biomedical engineering with an associates. 

Also the OP referenced putting batteries in a mouse, that made me assume tech related, not structural development of any kind. "
"The OP also should realize that since her friend disclosed she's going to apply, then she might blame the OP for not telling her she wasn't qualified.  Something like 'you set me up to fail' or 'if you were a true friend, then you would have told me I wasn't qualified'.

I think this is kind of a no-win scenario.  If the OP tried to clue her friend in, then she'd not being supportive or is trying to sabotage her or is just jealous.  If the OP doesn't, then pretty much the same thing.

OP, have some set responses if she starts to blame you.  Something like 'well, you knew the requirements of the job, just like me' or 'I'm not in charge of the hiring and I don't know the particulars of your CV' and 'you seemed so certain, I believed you'."
"You don't seem ready for this, but to be honest, your girlfriend even less. If *waiting* until you are ready, that is a termination of the pregnancy, is not an option, you have to *get* ready, for the sake of your kid.

Afterthought: ""make the $$ **somehow** "" doesn't sound good. You seem to be quite excited about the kid, and you haven't stopped short of crime before. You really have to get your shit together now so you won't resort to methods of getting money that land you back in jail."
"*if I don't like his decision then we should break up,*  He said it, not me.  OP, my advice is to be very careful and talk through many cultural expectations, ones that come from your side as well as his.  He's already shown that he is totally on board with *his* family's cultural expectation that the son and his wife life with his family.  How much does that include the wife being subservient and waiting on the parents hand and foot?  How does children and jobs enter into his assumptions for the future?  My advice is to proceed with caution, because honestly -- love is not always enough for a happy marriage.    "
"Good for her. That's paltry in light of your self-description of your horrid actions and lifestyle at the time. A judge would have you on probation longer than that, in fact you probably still were on probation or parole at that time. 5 to ten years is a more reasonable timeframe to trust that you really did change permanently. I can tell you that it's been 4 years since I broke up with my abusive ex who was way more high-functioning than you were, and he's abusing his current wife and racked up two DUIs. If I had got back together with him after a couple of years that would have been me."
"Most of the time together is not the same as living together. You don't share finances or household decisions or household labor if you still have your own apartment.

And the ""so far"" is the problem. You haven't had very much life experience together. You also ignored the part about how your boyfriend is going to be a super old dad."
"I can see why he needs to create space away from you. He was in the bathroom for fifteen minutes and you went knocking. It's rude enough to do that period, but after 15 minutes? 

Just how suffocating are you to this guy? His reaction might actually make sense..."
"yeah race is a social construct and isn't ""real"" genetically, but that doesn't mean it doesn't matter.

there's nothing in our dna that says we need to poop in the bathroom instead of the corner of the living room, but guess what, it still matters

  if society acts like it matters, then it matters.  "
"I'm never quite sure how he isn't creepy if he brings your mother flowers or goes to funerals with you.

But oke.. If that's really the only problem then I don't know what you could do about it (except promise to die young or to keep him alive forever I guess). "
"&gt; I know that the silence should be my answer.

So why aren't you just accepting it?

It's over. Move on with your life.

---

She doesn't owe you a reason. She just has to tell you that it's over. She has, now respect it."
"Thanks for your reply! 

I really agree with you about working. I was really confused because more than half of the people I talk to, and all of the people who advised me in college, always talked about doing ""what you loved."" It always seemed unrealistic to me. "
"&gt;  It is absolutely not on the table to consider asking her to leave right now; that would be a last resort if things like this continued to happen and started to effect our lives in a harmful way.

She alludes to it here. She keeps talking about having this happening in her home, but its in the separate apartment. I see she keeps saying she doesnt want to evict her, but she talks about how uncomfortable she is to have this near her kid and in her home. Its important to know the difference, and its important to respect their tenants privacy. Its a tough balance. 

Not to mention this:

&gt;2. She lives in our home and while we have separate spaces, this effects our lives as well. We have a small child who is our utmost priority.

Which makes it clear she is not clear on what to do here and that she feels this is not something she wants around her kid. 

Additionally:

&gt;Aside from support, we do also want to gently communicate that, because of our toddler, stability and emotional safety in our home are extremely important. How can we do that without sounding like “Oh hey, please don't inconvenience us by killing yourself at our house”?

Again, she is really not clear that her tenant is entitled to privacy, both in her health and welfare. I really would be concerned with her inserting herself into this persons life just because she lives in a apartment that is rented from OP. "
"It's legal in some states in the U.S.; you'd have to check the laws where you live. 

And yeah, it's also an option to find the guy if you can, and hope he's a good person willing to stick his neck out."
"Wow, this really hit home for me. My parents used to say the same thing about treating us the same. I had the same misfortune of an older, misbehaving brother getting the rest of us in trouble. I never made the connection that we shouldn't have been treated the same becuase we were drastically different kids. "
"The therapist is for you and your wife. Dont see your pastor, hes probably as big of a nutjob as you and your wife. You two need QUALIFIED help, not a sprinkle of holy water and shitty prayers."
I was just going to comment something like that!! Yes these are great comebacks to rude comments
My immediate suspicion in this situation is that they think they can get money for taking care of her now.  Whatever it is that's motivating them though it is not the thought of what is best for your sister and that's all you need to know.  
"Does your wife have a problem with your size?  Is it possible that she isn't standing up for you because she agrees with them, or thinks shaming you will get you to lose weight?

She should be standing up for you.  She chose to marry you and part of marrying someone is sticking up for them when others are attacking them.  It's supposed to be you two against the world, not others against you and her sitting on the sidelines.  She needs to grow some ovaries and tell her family to keep their mouths shut."
"Let her say what she's got to say. Whatever she says, take your time processing it and then respond.  "
"""Three strikes and you're out!"" 

But really though, if his first two flakes were genuine enough for you, just make plans for a third meeting. 

It seems like you're a little more interested in him than you're letting on, so just give him one more chance. 

If he's a no show, then you'll know where both of you stand."
Inhalers can be replaced but asthma without medication can lead to serious health issues. The brothers should be   redirected by parents and there should be some consequence to support how serious this can be. Phone restrictions might be an appropriate measure as an example.

Break up and go no contact. See a therapist. 
"Maybe you could ask her to meet a 1-2 of her close friends before a big group? Easier to get to know people and not feel overwhelmed, and then you'll already know them when you go out with the group. "
"I'm usually baffled at first. Like ""What? No way. I'm on my side..."" and then I get my bearings and realize nope, I'm starfishing dead center and he's got almost no room... oops!"
"That may be true, but that still doesn't make it okay, or legal, for him to pretend that it's something he created and can take credit for. He wants to have it, fine I can chalk that up to experience but he wants to use it? Not fine. I just don't want to jeopardize a relationship with a very good friend "
Yes I agree but my dad did what they asked. He took the picture down. He deleted it from his phone. He didn't disrespect their boundaries because those boundaries were not put into place until after the picture went up. They never sent out a list of rules or guidelines about taking pics of their kid. My dad didn't know. He did what they asked and he is still getting punished for it. 
"He *felt* like they were calling him a pedophile? Meaning they didn't actually call him a pedophile? Is it possible that they meant that posting the photo without permission was inappropriate, and he jumped to the conclusion that they were calling him a pedophile without merit? "
"I've known people who don't allow anyone to post pictures of their children because then the parents can't control who sees the pictures. 

A girl I knew had a baby and the grandma posted pics without permission. The grandma also had forgiven a man who had molested the mother, so he was on her friendlist. So the man who had molested my friend was able to see pictures of her baby. 

Not to say anything against your dad's friends, but your SIL doesn't know them. You don't really say much about her so we don't know why she's so against pictures of your nephew but in some cases people have very good reasons for it."
"She'll figure it out eventually, from your demeanor. I'm glad you're feeling okay about the break up. "
"To be fair, people handle grief in different ways.  But if bf doesn't trust OP, that is not a reason for her not to go, that is an issue to be worked out together if the relationship sticks. "
"No one's advice is going to change. What she's doing is inappropriate, and as an adult, it is **your** responsibility to  set clear boundaries. Make it known that it's not OK for her to be touching you physically (inappropriately), and that it's definitely not OK for her to masturbate in front of you. Because it isn't. 

Yes, maybe you want to be there for her. But you can't be, if this is how she'll act.

"
"It could be a sign that she has problems... but honestly, I don't know where people get this idea that young girls are not sexual. Teenagers are horny, it's normal, and young girls fall ""in love"" fairly easily. It's not nice to read your daughter's journal, she was not trying to sound like a sane person since she was writing it without expecting her family members to invade her privacy."
"&gt;can't afford to see a therapist

Find some money. This kind of deep insecurity is not likely to be resolved on your own. "
"If everyone who lived in Timbuktu told you to pack a jacket for your September visit and everyone who had only read about it told you not to bother, what would you do?

You read my back and forth and therefore know that actual bisexual people who know how friends and straight SOs react give different advice than the straight people on this sub when the question is asked. "
"Maybe she doesn't move in as she can't afford it. At 22 she should be focused on school and either live in student housing or with her parents. She's not at a point yet where she can shoulder half a household. If you don't want her staying with you with out paying, start limiting the nights over. "
He doesn't get to call you 'toxic' over this.  He made you guys buy special pajamas.   Your mom cooked a dish specifically for him.  And he just blew you all off and still doesn't see what's wrong with this.   Life is too short to be with someone so rude and immature.  You can do better than this.  Being alone would be better than dealing with his disrespect.
"At the very least he doesn't ever direct his anger towards me. However, there have been a few times where he didn't let go of some of his aggression after playing. While he wasn't angry at me, I could still hear anger in his voice when talking to me. But he does apologize when this happens. "
"&gt; what per month she'd be comfortable spending. She's refused to do that so far.

This is an entirely reasonable request that you would ask any one you planned on living with. It does not disclose her income or assets. "
"Being genderfluid or into crossdressing doesn't give you a free pass to sexually harass/assault your in-laws, nor does it give you a free pass to wear their clothes without their knowledge/consent. It sounds to me like he's using these labels, which may be true, as a cover for being a creepy jerk. Honestly, if I were you, there would be no more trips staying at his place and he wouldn't be invited to say at my place, and there would have to be a damn good reason to even be in his presence (wedding/funeral/parent birthday)."
"Yes, do the little things like send a sweet good morning text or a text randomly during the day telling her you love her etc. be spontaneous, not all the time, but a few times a month and surprise her with a dinner date or day trip to a cool place, go exploring. It can be simple. Not lavish gifts. Just that tiny bit of special attention. 

I understand the best friend thing. But she is also your gf. It's hard finding that balance. So when you do a friend thing, follow it up with a boyfriend/girlfriend thing. Example, watching the game, having a ball and biscuit, cool. But follow it up with something romantic. Run out for more chips and dip for the game, bring her a cheesy gift ""just because"" you love her. See? Friends and lovers. It'll be fine.

"

This is perfectly said and made me tear up a little.

"Holy shit run far far away.

I'm a man sober in AA for seven years, and I'm 31. What you're describing here is a malicious, drug addicted older woman who is emotionally abusing a younger dude. People in AA can be fucked up. People in AA can be master manipulators. Again, I say this as a man in AA. People get well, and stop being manipulators, when they have *long term sobriety*, 1+ years, not *right after a relapse.*.

Run far far away. She will abuse you worse than your last girlfriend, but trick you into thinking it's your fault."
"This side effect is real and there are drugs that don't have it. Your parents really have no right to force you to take that drug or prevent you from getting erections-- that's so wrong and de-humanizing-- for some context, it's considered cruel and unusual punishment to chemically castrate convicted pedophiles. "
"Well technically, right now, his mother goes out and buys all the presents and then writes 'From Jake' and 'To Mary' or whoever. We live in a different state so its really impractical for him to be buying all these gifts and bringing them all down on Christmas eve, when we fly/drive in. He's really distanced himself from the whole thing owing to how frustrated it makes him, and kind of just lets his mother do what she wants. 

And yes, I do think the expectation is a little bit nuts and I'd like to avoid it as much as possible. 

I actually really like the gesture of charity gifts like that, but I also know that it gets people a reputation for being kind of smug, lazy jerks. At the same time though, the commercialism of buying a gift for people I haven't seen for 364 days, and don't know at all, really annoys me. Especially when I'm not spending money on say, my own grandmother. "
Don't go home! Why set yourself up for being disrespected and bullied? Put yourself first 
"I agree, but one thing you left out is to understand there is likely to be negative reaction from the BF, and it may be justified. 

Because now he's put in the position of telling his family either (A) my girlfriend would rather be alone on Thanksgiving than spend time with y'all or (B) lie to their faces. 

I'd be pretty irritated and would be questioning the relationship going forward if I was him. "
"Well, I bet her ex did this for a damn good reason.

You need to do the same."
"Everyone has dealt wonderfully with addressing your body image issues, so I'll address the other part. He moved in after two months and is going to be financially dependent on you?  

How long have you known him?  Why on earth would you allow him (even encourage him!) To be financially dependent on you so soon?  Hot or not, that is very risky and probably not a wise idea.  Are you sure you aren't subconsciously trying to make him beholden to you to keep him around longer?  Or that you aren't being used by a stranger?  Or you are just making snap decisions to try to make up for what you perceive to be failings in your looks by being a ""good girlfriend"" in other ways?"
"He literally looked you in the face as he cheated on you and broke your heart. Fuck this guy. Move on to be with a man who truly loves and respects you the way you deserve. In every point of weakness where you feel like going back to this pathetic piece of shit, remember there is someone out there that will treat you the way you deserve. "
"That doesn't surprise me at all. I would think the type of bent asshole who is cool with ignoring consent/hurting kids would have very little problem lying like that. Narcissists usually fancy themselves master manipulators anyway, even when they're dumb AF. "
"I am 29 and she is 34.

The circumstances of the accident are kind of complicated.  I don't want to give specifics because it would be really easy to find news stories on it.  

But basically she did something stupid in a store.  Under normal circumstances it wouldn't have resulted in anything.  However, in this case something was installed wrong (not up to code) and the owner of the store knew it was wrong/not up to code and was just cutting corners.  The thing installed wrong ended up failing and caused her injuries.

The original lawyer looked over the case and saw that she did something stupid and unreasonable and was injured.  He said she didn't have much of a case because it wasn't known yet that the owner had been negligent with the thing that wasn't installed properly."
Is he getting treatment for his depression? Does he have a support group he can go to? Chronic illness is a very isolating experience.
"The boundary thing is really why I am having such a difficult time, because a lot of what happened now is just so hurtful thinking about it. All I got at the end when he admitted he fucked up a lot was just a lot of silence, me almost crying, and a single 'sorry,' and statement that he was angry at himself. Great, what am I supposed to with that now, you know?"
"I have had huskies for most of my life, who can also be extremely destructive when given the opportunity.

Does your girlfriend exercise the crap out of him?  A large amount of ""too much energy"" behavioral issues can be cured by making sure the dog is always tired.  She needs to try walking the crap out of him before she leaves the house and each evening to keep that level of tired going."
It just seems embaressing. I would be so so ashamed if my SO did that in front of my family. Especially since it seems like hubs family may of wanted to make it eaiser on her by telling her not to cook anything? 
"Dude, what your friends did was crappy. But how you're handling it is going to fuck up your relationship in short order.

Bottom line, your girlfriend was hurt. She was happy and proud to announce your relationship, and those two idiots crapped all over it. You should have deleted their comments right when you saw them and reached out to them directly to tell them that wasn't cool. **That would have shut this down immediately** and let everyone know you don't tolerate that bullshit. And it would have specifically let your girlfriend know you have her back.

Instead, you were passive as fuck. It wasn't a big deal to you, so you felt it shouldn't be a big deal to her.. That conveyed you didn't care and you allowed other men to make jokes about your girlfriend being with other men -- which led to her feeling judged as promiscuous and/or ""less than"" because she happened to have a previous relationship with your friend. That's not how you read the situation, but nonetheless that is how *she* read it and *her friends* read it.

Had you come correct, she would have been over it and smile with pride how her man showed up for her. **But you didn't.** You ignored it, expect her feelings to go away without resolution, and threaten to break up with her because she expresses she is *still hurt*.. So I have to ask, do you want to be with this woman?

If so, **stop dismissing her feelings**. Apologize. Talk to your friends and tell them you won't tolerate those kind of jokes about your lady. Then move forward. If you skip these steps, your relationship is likely over. It's hard to respect or remaining caring towards a man who allows others to disrespect you and tells you to shut up about it."
"Funnily enough ""has a job and is nice"" are not rare qualities in men, you have to bring something else to the table also"
"When my brother was 4, he saw a beetle and said ""look, there's a wicked witch."" His nursery school freaked out and contacted my parents because it clearly showed he didn't understand reality.

When I was 3 I went through a phase of pretending to be a cat. I mean, all the time. Which is to say, I went about normal 3-year-old business but referred to myself as ""this cat"" rather than ""I"".  It must have been annoying, but I was three and liked cats. My nursery school decided I was mentally ill. My parents actually had to ask me if I really thought I was a cat. Me: ""No, I'm a little girl pretending to be a cat.""  

So ... I actually don't find this at all unbelievable. Sometimes people who work with children are just horrible at their jobs."
"You'd think a girl, of all people, would understand what no means."
"What is it about weddings that make people so weird and self centered? You would seriously begrudge your groom one picture with his sibling because that's not ""all about the couple?"" 

Marriage is very much a family affair. Once you get married, and particularly if you have children, you will be a part of each other's lives for good, unless some awful drama forces someone to go no contact. Hell, in my experience, divorce doesn't even mean they're necessarily out of your life. I see my ex mother in law three times a week because she watches our youngest son. I've had family holiday dinners with them post divorce because they wanted the kids there, and their son (my ex) is a deadbeat who doesn't see his kids, and thus doesn't take them over to see his parents. These people are *never going away* (and I say that fondly.) If you can't see a wedding as a family function, I suspect you're going to have a rough go of things for the rest of the marriage and beyond..."
"In all honesty I'd distance myself from her too if she's doing this. My family is full of self centred drama queens , keeping a distance can really help."
She might benefit from a few rounds of therapy.  I would go insane if my husband refused to leave me alone while I sleep. That's not hyperbole. If I don't get a good 8-9 sleep I lose it.  Her having this sudden demanding irrational anxiety is troubling.
"I agree. He's cheating on you.  Depending on whose name is on the lease, either you need to pack up and be gone or his things need to be in a storage unit when he decides to come back.

You're better than being treated like a doormat.  It's going to hurt, I know, but better to move on now than let it go any longer."
My recommendation is to ease into this.  It's quite a jump to go from a boring sex life to a threesome.  Take some time to push your boundaries as a couple more gradually.  Some people may not be as okay with a threesome as they thought they were before it happened.
"I added a new cat to my home, and it took well over two months for the original kitty and new kitty to peacefully co-exist, let alone get along. And that way two adult cats, not a senior and a baby. 
 
You need to slow your roll, do some serious research on multi-cat homes, and make a concerted effort to make both cats as comfortable as possible. The introduction of a new cat is a very stressful situation and takes a lot patience to navigate. 

The cat is not being an asshole, he is being a cat. If you let your animosity towards an animal whose living situation you upset affect your relationship, that's entirely on you. "
"You said it. Because they're two people. Not one, but two different people."
"That may be his choice to not go somewhere if I'm there, but my Mother wants to treat us equally. So now I won't get to go on our annual family holiday, and I don't get to have the Family Movie/Game Nights I loved so much. I can ignore him, but it still impacts me, and makes it difficult to do the things I would like to in that respect. I appreciate your point though, maybe I should just let him get on with it and stop trying."
"Coming from an older person, your Bfs/gfs and most friends from high school don't last. You all have nothing to lose. Meet new people and make memories for when you go to college. 

It sounds like your brother is making the best of this, moving can be shitty and scary. Good for him. "
"This is unreal. Just absurd. I have had the same issue you have historically. I hated being the skinny dude throughout school and hearing people comment on it, so I'd probably feel like you....If I didn't grow up. 

Take your life into your hands and change your body if you are that sensitive. You're 28, holy shit. It takes all of a month at the gym and skinny guys like us show muscle definition. A year and you're ripped.

She sounds mean and strange, but damn you need to feel good about the way you look.

"I have a sneaking suspicion that OP's mom starting to think that demonic possession is somehow the cause of this issue is also a reason why litter boxes aren't getting cleaned. Episodes of disordered thinking often become accompanied by disorder in life in practice. Sudden new preoccupations with hoarding, forgetting to do regular chores and tasks, that kind of thing. "
"Utis won't make someone's vaginas stink.  They are extremely painful and if left untreated can land you in the hospital.  If the smell is so bad,  why are you still having sex?!  She could have any number of other infections and you're basically asking her to share them with you?  Wtf?  No more sex until both of you have seen a doctor.  It's entirely possible you're passing something back and forth to each other. "
"Probably for the best that you stayed out of it. Having your name attached to that drama-fest would have been pretty bad. This definitely sounds like a ""back away slowly until you can run away"" situation."
"Right? It probably looks bad, but it shouldn't have hurt as much as a broken arm, and a broken arm isn't enough to make someone lose their shit like this. He hit her because he was pissed and wanted to hurt her--not because he went into fight or flight. "

"I don't think it's so much that your wife is in love with Bill, but that she's definitely not in love with you. It sounds like she's chosen the security of marriage and is just stringing you along. See if she'll do counselling, but honestly you might be better just moving on. "
"I knew she'd stay with you despite the abuse because she admits she's too lenient and she was already set. Kind of guessed she only wanted to hear others agree with her. I'm unsure why you put everyone is ""still echoing the same sentiment"" as if they're supposed to magically change because you feel bad. Nope it doesn't matter to these people at all that you're fully committed when you don't own up to what you do and instead make excuses and downplay it. Saying sorry doesn't matter to these people when your apology is ""sorry and I feel really bad but it's not that bad or I only did it because X, Y, Z so it's not really my fault"" Hopefully you don't do this again. I doubt it since you haven't addressed why it happened.

Why was your first instinct to hit her?

Why did you think hitting her would stop the argument?

Why did you think the argument stopping because you hit her would be okay?

Why did you only felt bad when you hit her with too much force rather than feel bad that you hit her at all?

Saying isn't much when you don't analyze why it happened. I mean your SO has been making shit ton of excuses and downplays for you. But what have you done to analyze why it happened so it doesn't happen again."
"This is a very good point. What's happening on weekends? I don't know if OP ever wants children, but that will effect your sex life, also. Sex may not be priority, but it's still important.


I do understand life and stress gets in the way. I've been with my husband for almost 14 years, we both work full-time, and have a toddler. You find ways to find time, even if it means planning PTO together and getting a babysitter, lol. There have been times where we've gone a couple of weeks without sex. You just kind of keep putting it off, or it starts to feel too planned. Maybe you're just sick of each other for a bit. A whole YEAR, though?


Methinks maybe you two just aren't sexually compatible. You can love someone to death but not feel any chemistry with them. It sucks, and you may not want to hear it, but don't marry each other. "
This isn't going to work at all.  It doesn't really seem like you give a shit about her either.  
"Scan the letter and save a copy somewhere safe. Store the original in a fireproof lockbox. You may want it later, if only for your own peice of mind. It may also be useful to make sure she has no legal standing to have power of attorney over yourself or your brother or visitation to any future children. See an attorney for that.

For the rest...there's not much to do but maintain no contact. Seeing a therapist who specializes in childhood abuse may help. Many people may downplay the horrible thing she did. Those people are monstrous and you don't need them. 

Good luck moving forward."
"His parents themselves aren't the issue (considering they aided him in actually marrying the girl he fell in love with).

"Um it's totally your fault they treated him badly. Seems like they saw you have no respect for his feelings and they could walk all over him. He's telling you to be considerate of his feelings and your first response is that your not responsible for his insecurities? He just got put down because your family walked all over him. He not annoyed by your masculinity, but your lack of empathy "
"If your past partners said this then you are likely the one making it this way.

It's a little frustrating that you want post coital intimacy and snuggling but are completely disengaged during sex. You're emotionlessly fucking her, she feels sad and empty. Sex isn't making her feel loved, so asking her to suddenly snap out of it and cuddle you is somewhat unfair.

You need to kiss her during sex, and touch her. Not just put your penis in her. Grab her thighs, hair, butt, everything. Make out with her. Look in her eyes. Make eye contact. Make noises. Think about how much you love her and how beautiful she looks, and try to express it.

Why do you think you feel nothing during sex? Do you love her? Do you like sex? These aren't rhetorical questions, I really am asking. Have you ever felt emotionally close to someone during sex? Do you have trouble feeling emotionally close to other people as well?

That cuddling after sex that makes you feel so loved... Can you apply that intimacy to sex? You could have cuddle-sex

How are you having sex? What positions? Is she always facing away (e.g. doggy)? Is it with the lights on? Are you clothed? Do you ever touch her or look at her? Do you shut your eyes? I'm just trying to diagnose what's going on here.

I think you need to reframe your mindset. It's concerning that you feel emotionally drained. Sex should be fun and intimate. Are you satisfied with everything else in the relationship? Are you happy?

I know this is a ton of questions. I just would like more info about your sex life, how happy you are in your relationship, and your ability to connect non sexually.

Sorry if it's too much, this is just interesting to me. Most people come in here with the disease, but you came to us with a symptom. It's a puzzle and I wanna help you figure out the disease."
"No he can't go because he's got a work commitment, I already asked since the day I found out. As for avoiding being alone with my ex, it's just not going to happen, there will be a number of people at the funeral and at his place afterward plus I'm not staying with him so I'm not worried there. "

"I watch a good amount of porn, and went to the doctor. I asked my doc for Viagra, and she asked me about porn. She said, if I watch a lot of porn, my brain becomes overloaded with several images becoming hyper stimulated, and then when I am with a live real person, I get both anxious, and a little bored. It's like, if you live out your pefect fantasy in your mind, real life is much less exciting.

As a result, I cut back on my fappening, and also now take more vitamins, and have started to exercise. I have found that both of these have increased my libido and reduced my anxiety.

Hope my two cents help."
"You have the stab wound, buddy! Nobody is going to not believe you, but I also don't know why you would lie and say you were robbed. How did you end up at the hospital? How did you get there? Did they talk to whoever took you there? Something is missing in your story. "
"I've done the same thing. Online relationships are even more confusing than IRL relationships because you can pretty much only guess what the person actually means. Not seeing their body language or hearing their tone of voice takes away a lot of context.

Don't worry about it, really. Just do a check-in with yourself though. Are you doing ok? Are you lonely? There could be something deeper going on. Or not. But I think it's worth some self-reflection!"
"Leave her. Do not even think twice here, please.

* She beats your dog to the point it hurts you to think about it.
* **SHE HITS YOU AND BLAMES YOU.**
* You haven't been happy with her.
* You are afraid she'll hurt you.

I understand you are suffering due to depression, but make no mistake, no one should ever go through the things you are going through.

For your own safety, I recommend breaking with her in a public place, and have the police take out her stuff from your father's house. Do not let her stay with you, do not let her make you think she can change, because she can't. Cut her from your life OP, because there is nothing to gain here. ***Do not let her convince you that she can change.***"
"Thank you:) I completely agree about the trust never going back to its original level, but I think it's a good thing, I used to hold him on a pedestal and think we were made for each other, which is kind of silly...I don't trust that he will never develop crush on anyone else till the day he dies, but I trust that he will be honest with me from now on and do the right thing for us.  "
"60/40 isn't a deal, its logical.

There are four rooms in the house. 

•1 exclusively for you and your bf

•1 exclusively for the roommate

•2 shared by three people (so split the costs 3 ways)

That leaves you and your bf responsible for 2.33 of the four rooms (or 58%) and him for 1.66 of the rooms (or 42%).

If you don't want to live with him again because he's a bad roommate that's your own prerogative, but don't pretend its because of the rent. Act like an adult and just tell him you aren't interested in living with him further.

"It's hard being an introvert.  All you want is 1-5 close friends that you connect with on a personal level. It's hard to find 1-5 like minded people in a sea of strangers if you're not happy with ""groups"" of friends or being a social butterfly. "
I said it in the opening paragraph!
"I'm amazed no one family even offered YOU an apology. Not even a, ""Hey, Woah, it wasn't meant like that but I see this really hurt your feelings. I'm sorry. How can I make this better?""

Instead all the burden is left on you... It's all, ""Oh gosh, you feel a way that doesn't suite us? Ugh, get over yourself. JUST A JOKE LOL"" 

I have a nagging suspicion this is a long-standing pattern amongst the family. Judging by the fact they plan ski vacays and intentionally kept it from you for years... yea

I don't see why you should apologize for being upset; if your reaction made them upset, they should focus on why that is, what it was that was hurtful. I'd talk to them - just to be sure they know you don't hate them forever, but try to get them to see where you're coming from. Even just a ""hey, please don't invade people's personal space/take their belongings for whatever reason without asking first"" might help them see your perspective if they don't already. (I mean, the kids. Honestly, I doubt your sisters will apologize anytime soon for anything).

You could try to have a heart-to-heart with your sisters... but it sounds like they completely disregard how you feel about... everything. 

I'm sorry, OP. I don't have proper advice on how to navigate it. I just can empathize with you. "
"Regardless of your previous experience, what he did was outrageous and unacceptable.  Sure, he's faaaamily, but if being cousins doesn't cause him to treat you with respect then why should you have to treat him any special way.


I agree with just being barely civil.  Ignore him as much as possible.  "
"Thank you! I'm happy for you, too. It's always good hearing other peoples' stories. And I agree about the boob thing. It's such a strange feeling when I hug people now. I've gone from 30A to 32C. Still ""small"" when compared to other women, but holy shit, what a difference. "
"She needs to maintain a processional relationship with the inmate. I don't care if he's the nicest guy on earth. She needs to tell her boss. 

If she wants attention/love/affection so badly, have a girls night and sign her up for a dating site. She can write to anyone she wants on there. "
Have you asked if they will have a look?
"Honestly, I think your relationship with your boyfriend is over. He wants you to have an abortion and then maybe you can give your 'new relationship' a chance and maybe in the future, blah blah, blah; he's asking you to commit to having an abortion but he won't commit to your relationship. He was just as involved in making the baby as you were.

If you have the abortion, regret it and stay with him, it will destroy your relationship. If you have the baby then your relationship with him is over. 

So to me the actual question you need to answer is: do you want a baby? 

If you choose to have the baby then your boyfriend will be a parent and liable for child support but you can't know if he'll step up and actually be a good dad. It's kinda irrelevant though; given that you will be a good mum.

It's a tough decision but please find a better boyfriend, one who supports you and your decisions, isn't a selfish prig and won't threaten you with ending the relationship at the drop off a hat. 
"
To me he just sounds like a terrible person who can't accept being wrong or dings to his pride.
You might as well be doing it on purpose since you do it everynight and havent made and effort to stop. You dismiss his concern and tell him you cant control it as if that makes it ok. You are being oversensitive because your husband is showing you what he has to constantly deal with. You need seperate beds. Sleep in the same room but get a seperate bed. 
"You aren't ready to settle. You have dreams that you want to go make reality. That's fine. It also means that you aren't compatible with her. 

You can either no go travel, and settle down -which will likely lead to resentment towards her-, or you can do your own thing for however long it takes you to do so- but don't keep her around while you do. 



"
"You know what the sensible thing to do if you're frustrated with the person you're dating being an asshole is?  Break up.  Not retaliate in kind.

&gt; I think about and really appreciate all his great qualities

What are those, exactly?  Because I seriously can't think of anything that would balance out him treating you like this.  Certainly nothing that you couldn't also find in someone who *won't* treat you like this.

&gt; and feel like if we break up, I won't be able to find someone with the same qualities who will match up with me

Staying with someone because you're afraid you can't do better is never a good idea.  And again (because I cannot stress this enough), I don't think it should be that difficult to find a guy who will at least introduce you as his girlfriend and smile while doing it."
"He's fine reciprocating when I initiate. This only happens when he asks me to ""cuddle"". If I say ""does cuddle mean sex?"" or say ""Cuddle?"" while waggling my eyebrows he'll say no because *insert paper-thin excuse* and start the whispering about his boner, asking me if I want to give it a ""goodnight"" squeeze, or rubbing it on me within 10 minutes. 


I've only asked him if this is his kink outside of the bedroom once but inside I've asked if he wants to play his ""game"". He always denies it but then makes me feel bad about not pushing if I don't. I'm worried we'll go back to him never initiating *at all* if I cut it off. "
"Well she is going to find out eventually. I would say she will be more hurt if you don't tell her early (Especially if one of the moms/bil/sil accidentally spills the beans) so just go for it. Let her know that it's not for public release yet and she is one of the very few people you are trusting with this until you are 3 months on. If the previous ""disapproval"" comes up you just laugh it off as like, ""funny you should say that, guess what!"". 

Considering how far apart your dates are, she will have plenty of time for getting attention before you announce, and you aren't even really going to start to show until probably after she's had hers."
"I don't know how you managed to reply to two responses asking why you're playing the same pointless game again with just 'yeah it's sad he's so selfish about food'. You missed their point entirely, it's like you just pick out supportive key words and zone in on them. Are you looking for a cheering squad or help? "
"I'm torn on this one. I don't think you need to like coldly show her the door 5 minutes after you've caught your breath, but I think even if you check in and say ""reminder that I don't want anything longterm from this"" your actions may convince her otherwise. Especially if you find a comfortable arrangement that lasts a couple of months - she's likely to think that if she just continues to hang around long enough that you'll eventually be ready to settle down. 

I'm assuming a lot of things here (that she wants a LTR, and that you won't eventually!) but my point is that if you truly don't want to have a girlfriend, I'd err on the side of avoiding girlfriend-like things (sleepovers, meeting family/getting close to your friends, pancakes, vacations, etc.). Keeps the ambiguity out of it."
"Buddy, if you were THAT tired, why didn't you stop the intercourse before YOU orgasmed?"
"Honestly she might not be consciously thinking ""if I do this and this it will wear down his defences and make him vulnerable!"" She's just doing what works to get her the response she wants in the short term. ""If I scream at him he'll stay home with me and try to make me feel better."" It might help if you frame it that this relationship is destructive for both of you - abusers *can* learn healthy behaviour, but it will almost *always* fail if they remain in a relationship where they already have a pattern of abuse. It's become a deeply ingrained habit, almost like a (psychological, not physical) drug addiction - she can get clean if she really wants to, but probably not if she insists on living in a house with a bunch of other people constantly doing her drug of choice. Obviously the really big, number one, most important reason to leave her is because she's hurting *you*, but it can help you go through with it if you tell yourself that staying with her is enabling her in behaviour that's destructive to herself as well. What she's getting from you isn't something that's ever going to fill up the hole she's trying to fill, but as long as you're around she won't try anything else."
"&gt;how much emotional support can you get from just texting?

You're projecting your own preferences onto her. Just because you can't imagine feeling truly supported by anything other than smashing genitals together doesn't mean that's how it is for her.

Words of support can mean a huge amount to someone who feels alone. 

"
"He will never be anything but hazy.  That's part of the side effects of his medication.  He can either be broken or fuzzy. 

It will be entirely up to you to make decisions and enforce them. To people with schizophrenia this person who is a trusted decision maker is often referred to as a ""gate keeper"". 

You can not give in on anything if you choose to accept this role, you will literally be his boss in most things. 

It's not easy to do but if you think he's worth it it will be worth it."
"24 is plenty old enough to at least have an idea of whether you want to remain with your partner of three years. She's being utterly reasonable, and if you're unwilling to even have a conversation about the future then I hope you enjoy being single. "
"The chances of getting pregnant the first time a couple has sex are exactly the same as their chances of getting pregnant any other time. Every person who has ever gotten pregnant through intercourse has gotten pregnant from a single sexual encounter. For lots of people, it was their first or only encounter with that partner. "

"We left our 2-month old with my in-laws for about 12-18 hours years ago, and we regarded it as a big favor they did for us. I'm sure they are worn out and wanting a break from the stress, but this isn't the kind of thing you can assume someone will do, even close family. You have to ask and be nice about it. "
"I wanted to answer just that, and if OP looks at the recent askreddit thread asking men what they wish girl understood about them, it's one of the recurring answers : men apparently tend to try to fix the issue, not comfort or empathize, and girls should just tell them if they want help to fix whatever issue they have, or if they just want to be held and told ""it's going to be okay"". It's a rushed summary, but it helped me understand better my relationship with my BF, now I try do be more direct and we communicate better. Good luck op !"
"&gt;I don't know how this could have happened or what to do next.

At the risk of sounding like a TV special, abstinence is pretty much the only 100% sure birth control method. People can and do get pregnant using condoms, the pill, and other forms of birth control. 

That said, wait for a paternity test like everyone else said. 

You can't *make* her get an abortion, that's just not an option as much as you might not like it. "
"Well I mean, he straight up told me when his family asked why they haven't met me yet that he told them its because I'm crazy and can't be around people... He's never invited me to meet them or to even meet any friends. If he ever has plans he tells me he's going out but never offers to let me go with him, kinda feels like he doesn't want anyone meeting me especially since I almost always invite him out with me."
"She sounds entitled to be upset at the lack of proper respectful communication. You keep saying you had no plans for when you're off work but you actually had. You wanted to clean up your shared kitchen, pack your bags, have a bit of rest and get in your car about 6 PM. You could have made a 5 minutes phone call to your girlfriend to inform her of your plans."
"And just wait until you get to see London, Stockholm, Bali, Tokyo! 

I truly believe that only a few people dare to live extraordinary lives. Most people settle for whatever it's most confortable out of fear or because they just don't know better, but you right now have the opportunity to expand your horizons and live a little. (Almost) every single person can make babies, but how many can actually go out and see the world? It's New York now, maybe it'll be Cancun tomorrow, maybe you hate it when the novelty wears off but then you can always go back home, find a decent guy and make babies, just like every other lady and their mum's and grandma's did in your town, but at least you'll have stories to tell and a different perspective on life. 

What I really do not condone is running away. If your guy is as awesome as you claim and you love him as much as you do, the least you can do is let him know you are leaving and say goodbye. If you are going to be brave, don't start your journey by leaving a coward. "
"Why?! So she can continue to ignore you on the days you're supposed to spend time together and not respect your feelings regarding relationships with male friends?? You've said so yourself she doesn't even want to talk to you for long when you just want to catch up on each other's lives. 
I repeat, you are not her priority "
"Are you sure that she just wants it on a superficial level? Lying to your friends and family about this, including your GF, doesn't sound right either. Have you ever attended mosque with her and her family?"
Maybe she wants someone worthy of her trust.  
"He's a man of 27 and he's talking about high school nonsense like the ""bro code""?  He dated this girl 2 years ago and he's still hung up about it?  

To be honest OP, your boyfriend sounds like he's pretty immature.  How much you tolerate this is up to you."
"Lift, run, listen to music(while lifting or running), have sex, if available. My go to stress relievers, they never let me down.

I have an ex wife who loves to send me ""stress relieving"" texts(50-50 custody so can't block her), it's a nightmare, f'ck every single person that sends hateful messages through text or social media and harasses their ex's or anyone for that matter, those messages are not harmless, they hurt(no matter how thick your skin, it's still a dark cloud hanging over your life) and its bullsh*t that instead of these people facing their own emotional shortcomings they project it all on other people."
Whatever you do pay you need to write on the memo lines the exact dates that you intend the check to be for. Are you just writing 'rent' on the line? Change that to 'rent 12/1/16 thru 12/31/16'. You can't argue and change the intended purpose if a check at a later date if it clearly says what it was for. 
"&gt; I wasn't even living here in September, it was out of the question!

Most places you pay a pro-rated amount for partial months. I also moved in September and had my old place through September 30, so in September I paid rent on my old place, the deposit for my new place, and half of September's rent in my new place. For those overlapping days, I paid rent in both places because I had rights to be in both of those places.

It sounds like you need to sit down with your boyfriend and talk about finances generally at a neutral time to be sure you are 100% on the same page. You are both making assumptions and this doesn't sound like healthy communication that addressed the issues at hand."
"They didn't say not to confide in family, just do the reveal gracefully instead of at the end of an unrelated fight or something. "
"Thats part of the fun, to deny you even the acknowledgement that shes doing it on purpose. She definitely knows what shes doing. Shes no victim, although they want to look like one. Anything to be the emotional vampires, living off others and hurting others to feel good about herself. She knows. Shes no victim. Shes making victims. "
My mother wasn't too happy with my life choices once I moved out and became my own person. I'm just living a normal life. I have a stable job and stable relationships. It's not OP's fault if someone is butt hurt just because they decided to live life on their terms instead of someone else's.
"By reading it to the father it becomes OP shit stirring. Not that there was much sympathy, but it was unredeemable after that.

OP you have a major chip on your shoulder and trying to control your daughter is a form of abuse. You have to earn her trust if you want her to feel comfortable enough to contact you more than twice a week (which is excessive tbh)....

You're the parent. You need to start behaving like it. You would definitely benefit from counselling or therapy, and honestly if you actually want a relationship with your daughter you should go to see a therapist.

Edit: it's once every two weeks she calls you - that's quite normal and healthy."
Yeah it sounds miserable. He is probably doing it to himself as well though. I for one would never stand for that shit. I would make dust-trails like the roadrunner out of there.
"It sounds like she put you on something called (vlc=very low contact ).  That is a strategy that people with narcissistic or delusion parents have to do when their boundries are frequently violated, they are continuously attacked over perceived slights  (like in this instance ) and/or when they never get apologies for being wronged in the past.  If vlc doesn't work out, it can be upgraded to NC or no contact.   That is usually a last resort when the narcissistic family member cannot be reasoned with.  It looks like you might be headed for NC because you certainly aren't doing well with low contact. 

It sounds to me like the gift to the boyfriend was an excuse to force them to interact with you or else they are ""ungrateful"".  Even though you were thanked, you didn't receive the right amount of attention you *so* deserve so you manufactured an excuse to get more attention. 

It seems that no amount of attention or control will be enough for you.   You're more interested in playing psychological games than having a relationship with your daughter. 

I know its next to impossible to get through to people like you but listen to me.  Get help.  Get a life.  If you stopped talking to your daughter today,  i doubt she'd give a shit and its YOUR FAULT.

"&gt; Don't you think this might have an impact on the whole issue? Maybe she just feels like a parent and no longer like a woman.

Yes, I'm pretty sure it is. But I try to support her in this as much as I can. kids in the morning and after school are my thing, cleaning, cooking, and many other duties are divided and i try to pull my weight as much as i can.


&gt; SAHM means stay at home mum....

No, in fact she got a new job in the summer which is more time-consuming. I supported her decision (and still do) as this was her passion and this job is perfect for her. However as one of her reasons was not enough time it did hurt me a bit that she would take a job where this got worse.

It makes me wonder if the reason is true or an excuse

"I can't trust someone who will lie to me.
It may be a little lie, or a big lie, but if you're going to lie to me about one thing, you'll lie to me about more, so I can't trust you and you're gone."
"What exactly do you think you're going to get from other women that you're not getting from her?  Is it something you can at least talk to her about exploring together before you decide it's time to call it quits or ask about opening things up (although if she hasn't expressed any interest in anything like that in over a decade, I wouldn't get your hopes up too high)?  Or are you under the impression that quantity and quality are somehow connected?  Because if it's the latter, something tells me you're going to get tired of the ""game"" a lot sooner than you expect."
Well I learned a new word today thanks to this topic.
"If a guy doesn't want to see you again because you didn't put out on the *first* date, then you should continue looking anyway. I always felt the third was the gold standard. First date to see if there's any chemistry. Second to confirm the first date wasn't a fluke and to build upon the first. Third is all systems go (assuming that's where you want to take it). 

&gt; Bottom line is that I can't sleep with a man I just met, and I don't want to leave my comfort zone just to see if he'll give me a chance.

If this is how you feel, cool. Don't compromise yourself to keep someone around. That's absurd. If you can't find someone to stick around after a first date, then I'd seriously re-think who you're choosing to date and your method of finding them."
I wouldn't want to be around your dad either in your sister's positions. Kudos to you for supporting her.
"I usually initiate requests for date nights - she suggested once in the last year for my birthday. I'd arrange for one set of the grandparents to look after the kids. Make reservations or buy tickets to a show. We'd have a great time, and I really start to feel connected and happy. We'd be on the way home to an empty house and she'd want to go pick up the kids. Wtf? It's like a ton of bricks. This has happened multiple times. It's demoralizing. The kids are good and well behaved and the grandparents don't mind. "
"For reference to us Americans: getting ""pissed"" in England means getting drunk and having a good time.  In the states it means to get angry."
"James is a fucking child and an absolute asshole. I think very much that he didn't mean to tell you about himself and Ian, or that he regrets it. He seems to enjoy drama and the shit he did with you is calculated and weird. 

I saw in comments that you said Ian already knows what James did regarding you, I don't think it would be at all bad to let him know what else he told you. I mean, I would definitely want to know if my friend acted this way behind my back. It would be painful, yes, but you would just be letting him know. It's up to Ian how to handle it, but it's fair for him to know what he's getting in to. "
"You should ask for doctors notes and such with dates. Just to be safe. And give your family some hard evidence that your son's mother is actually unwell, and "
"You're so right. A good girlfriend soothes her man whenever he needs the emotional release of venting, because after all performing that kind of emotional labor is what a good girlfriend does. She needs to be there soothing him whenever he wants to vent about how irrational she is and how all she (and other females) want is soothing and not good hard male problem solving. If she withholds this soothing balm from him, and doesn't properly display comfort and understanding, and instead she problem-solves for him like she thinks she's a MAN or something, then she's unworthy of him and deserves to die alone. I totally agree with you. "
"You're not alone. I've been with my husband for almost 22 years and I'm still stupidly, giddily, infatuated and in love with him. I still love having frequent sex. I look at him and want my hands all over him, and his hands all over me, all day long. We also put effort into being this way. We spend a lot of time  building and strengthening our bond, emotionally and sexually and as companions. I don't know if I could stay married to someone I wasn't still infatuated and in lust with.  "
No!!!! Leave her alone and let her move on. You would put more salt on to the wound. She will move on and on her own time.
"&gt; My name is not on the deed of the second house, just in the mortgage loan.

Mortgage is in his name so he's pretty much stuck paying for it.  It's a shame he didn't ensure that his name was on the deed when he agreed to the mortgage."
"Whoa. I have to apologize. I read the title, went 'naw, it can't be that weird' read it and now I'm just 'HOLY SHIT YOU ARE LIVING IN A BIZARRE HORROR/THRILLER STORY'.

I don't really have anything to add that hasn't been said.  Boundaries will need to be drawn and your boyfriend will have to stick to them and if he can't manage that well.....  

Maybe another idea is for you to minimize your interactions with them. Tell your boyfriend he can visit them but you won't be going?

In the meantime please PLEASE write a memoir about your encounters, I am fascinated by the strangeness of this situation. "
"Realize that this means he has no frame of reference for what a healthy relationship is. It has formed his expectations, and you probably won't know what that means until you're already in it. 

This needs to be a conversation. In the very least, he needs to acknowledge how strange it is, and be able to talk about how it affects him. Saying he can set boundaries is not the same as setting them. And yelling isn't setting boundaries. 

I can't see this ending well, if he doesn't realize how serious this is."
"&gt;I think we both have low sex drives, and after a hard day of work, all we want to do is sleep.

Have you both been working all day every day for the past year? This doesn't sound like a good excuse"
You sound really selfish. Why didn't you stop before you orgasmed if you really were THAT tired?  
Can you invite your parents' friends to the party?  That would be amazing.  Then they could try to cancel the stripper before he showed up.
"Drug abuse that she has to say ""no"" to for you?

Getting very mean, screaming abusive things at her (and her already being a victim of abuse)?

Had a tantrum over a bday demand (hint, that's not how gifts work) when she had already gone all out for you?

Again with the ""extremely mad"" over the bday?

You actually get annoyed at what she does in her spare time when you aren't there (amount of sleep, wtf I can't even wrap my mind around this one)?

Lied to her about your age?

You actually said that to her? She was sad about not getting to meet her bio dad and you basically told her ""get over it""?

And you want to know if *she* is toxic - do I have that right? As far as this:

&gt;I feel like I lost the love of my life, why is this happening?

the best advice I can give is to see a therapist and tell them everything you have written here. Good luck."
"I'm with you on the body shaming aspect, but not on outing him as an underwhelming lay. He is a gross asshole for what he did, treating a person like a part of a game, misrepresenting himself, and seeking petty revenge at OP's expense."
I'd wait. Make sure he isn't impulsively trying to recapture his youth by marrying a much younger woman and reliving what it's like to have a young family again.
"This was a really dumb idea in the first place.  I doubt he was being maliciously manipulative - sounds like this was just a stupid idea he thought of and ran with it because it gave him the warm fuzzies.  

He's displaying violent behavior and making threats.  Your priority is the child you've now decided to keep, and that isn't someone the child should be around.  Start preparing to be a single mom as that's how this will likely go.  

I'd make it clear that this is happening with or without him and if he wants a relationship with you and the kid, he's got to get help immediately.  Continue with your plans and your life, but stop waiting around for him and expecting him to suddenly revert to the same guy he was while he was pressuring you to get pregnant."
I dated a guy that eventually came out as a vampire. I'm glad there's somebody out there who can understand.
"I would feel like I had a thoughtful boyfriend who has professional etiquette. : ) 
You can tell him that you know the flowers made her day. Wink wink you would love it if someone got you flowers.

"Alzheimer's is a type of dementia, and the most common one. You can't predict which way a personality change will go with any kind of dementia, and if it will occur. I've seen it go every possible way: nice people become monsters, nasty people become way more pliable, and people whose personality (positive or negative) becomes more pronounced. 

@ OP: I'm really sorry for you. This must be incredibly hard. Maybe it helps to know that this is not your grandma, she really can't help it. My guess is that she reverts to a behavior pattern she knows from the past (cutting someone out) only now she's doing it for irrational reasons. You can't do a lot about it. You can ask other family members like your mom to consistently friendly remind her that you haven't done anything wrong. You can treat her like you always did. Don't call her out on her faults but give her love. Remember that the world is a terribly confusing place for her these days. Human interaction is so complex. You really can't fault someone with addled brains for getting it wrong. Good luck. Maybe it will blow over in time."
"&gt;I guess it sounds bad

It sure does. I can see why they freaked out.

&gt; ""well if you knew that we wouldn't like him, shouldn't that tell you something about him?"" 

She's got a point. NEVER date someone you are ashamed of. You must have sensed that.

&gt;I was still a liar

To be fair, you were. But from what I see, they are very judgemental and a bit controlling, and essentially they made you feel FORCED to lie to them in the first place, so this is  80% their fault. 

&gt;a family session for the three of us 

yes, that is highly advisable, and I'm sorry they won't do it. I think you need to insist.

&gt;Jack reached out to them and said ""we all want what's best for her, is it possible to meet up for a coffee to discuss things?"" 

I have to say, Jack is behaving very well throughout this. He must be a lot better man than he appears 'on paper'.

How to move forward: I suggest you say to your parents: ""OK, this got off on the wrong foot. Let's *please* do the family therapy, mom dad and me, and see if we can re-boot this relationship. If that goes well, we'll bring Jack in to the sessions too. Will you do that for me?""

And if they say No, then they can fuck right off out of your life.

"To be fair, a reasonable sibling that cared about her relationship with her sister not only wouldn't have stolen art in the first place, but wouldn't have brushed off her siblings concerns like they weren't a big deal after the fact either. What they suggested is a bit of a ""nuclear option"", but it doesn't seem like anything short of that would get through her head how serious acting like that is. "

"&gt;Cause yeah, usually you don't have to ask people to look you in the eye.

Yeah. He doesn't seem ""off"" though, just super disinterested.

However, he stated he had ADHD as a child. He still seems to have that problem. BUT he has made no steps towards fixing that.

It's exhausting to have to clearly state ""I would like a reply"" every time after I say something. It's exhausting to restate how I like being touched every new time we cuddle, as if he has no recollection of last time.

It's sometimes part of the deal. But it isn't assumed with him.

I'm understanding that I'm on edge all the time because nothing is ever assumed. I can't assume that he will reply to something important I said. I can't assume he will hug me even when I ask him too (sometimes I've begged him to and he just stands there).

Actually, the only thing that can really be assumed and relied on, is that he won't listen to what I say even seconds after I say it.

For example, last night we went on a walk in the dark, and he kept turning the flashlight on. That's okay, but I liked looking at the stars, and it was hard with the light. I asked him to let me know *before* he turned it on, so that I could close my eyes and not have them burned by the light. He said ""okay"", so I know he heard me.

He still turned the flashlight on 3 times without warning, despite me complaining that he was hurting my eyes each time. He just says ""sorry, forgot"" and that's the end of it.

He definitely lacks social skills. I guess it's hard to believe that it's not something wrong with me, though. He's hammered it home so many times that it's my fault because he just doesn't know, understand, or he forgets -- and then I see messages repeated on the internet like ""well, you can't expect them to read your mind"" and I feel like it's my responsibility to repeat myself all the time and never his responsibility to think about me and my preferences/feelings even a teeny bit.

So that's what's going on in my head. Sorry for the long post again."
"&gt; When I read that, I really got scared and contacted his parents nd sent them screen shots of everything he sent me.

Then I'd say you've more than fulfilled your responsibility here.  If you need to send one last reply before you block him (or at least put his messages through a filter where you don't have to read them but do have them handy in case you need to contact the authorities regarding a restraining order), tell him that what he decides to do with his life is his choice, just as what to do about this pregnancy is yours, and this is the last thing you have to say to him on the subject - or anything else.  Then do what you have to do and get on with your life."
"Yes you would, and nobody here is trying to imply that video games are uncivilized or not art."
"That was incredibly, incredibly insightful. I need to digest that for a little bit. I'll think through my answers and type them up. Regardless of whether anyone reads them but me, you've given me a LOT to think through about my own patterns in relationships of trying to focus on the positive, sometimes to my detriment. Thank you. "
"It IS terrible advice. There was a thread the other day about a guy who proposed to his gf intending to have a ""forever engagement"". Unsurprisingly, she thought engagement = eventual wedding. A normal expectation. He was stupid, and you're advising this guy to be stupid. You can't put someone on layaway."
Tell his sister that his cat is still there and he needs to take care of it. 
"No I asked him if he could make it but this Saturday is a day he has to work, the last couple months have been busy when it comes to his job. Which is part of the reason he's unhappy about me missing this get together. "
"It's too soon to feel invested with this girl, and your feelings about the relationship being built on lies are spot on. Unless you can think of a reason that would make working on this worth it, I'd end it. "
I agree. I'm just so angry that I fell in love with him and now I'm in this horrible situation. Just trying to find the strength to leave is so difficult. I had been single for 4.5 years before I met him. I've dealt with many horrible things in my life as well and never treated anyone the way he treats me. 
"Wow. Sorry to hear that.  All I can say is study hard and try get a job if your allowed, save as much as you can so once your 18 you can move out. Best of luck.  "
"I've noticed this as well, and it is a bit of a problem.  But there's two things that strike me about this situation:

1) He's very descriptive about what his wife is doing that's irrational (oh yeah, screaming, pounding on the floor for an hour!)

2) He's very vague about what his family might or might not have done to cause this problem with his wife (2 -3 years ago there was something? I don't even remember what it was about) and what he's done over the past 2 - 3 (or more years) to figure out why there's a rift between his family and his wife.

Stuff like that are red flags that you see a lot on subreddits like /r/justnomil - it's usually an indicator that the husband (OP in this case) has missed stuff and/or been 'keeping the peace' (by basically not doing anything) and letting his wife basically have an emotional breakdown.

I'd also say that generally I've seen the red flags in relationships for women controlling men described differently then those for men controlling women.  

Like women bring up the fear of physical violence and controlling behaviour around their assumed promiscuity that culminates in physical or sexual abuse.  Men seem to bring up verbal abuse more so than physical (though it probably does happen they just don't bring it up as often) or sexual (though I'm 100% sure that happens as well) and when they're isolated, it's a gradual process that seems to involve their abuser slowly driving away friends and family through repeated behaviour issues (though I'm sure ultimatums are also used, it just isn't a thing that seems to be reported as often).

It's made me wonder whether although the scenarios are the same across genders, the way we described them makes for different red flag identification.


Edit: having read your update OP, might I suggest you also check out /r/bpdlovedones just in case your wife falls into that category"
"Yeah, this is about her not Marco. It makes her uncomfortable. I would ignore her, and see this as practice for setting boundaries with her"
"If she's ashamed of YOU this relationship is fucked. 
She can stand up to her family or end this relationship. This is awful OP, do not do it "
Invoice him for baby sitting and house keeping fees.
I'd return them. You were very clear about this. 
"You are their third. I'm sorry, but this relationship does not facilitate you being on equal footing with the other members. They treat you like the decoration on their life as a couple, and you deserve better.

Which is not to mention that he doesn't seem to be ready to maintain a relationship with anyone, let alone one with two people and all the extra emotional maintenance that requires.

I would suggest you leave. And when you are in a position to be a in a triad relationship in the future, do so in one where the home has two bedrooms."
"Wow, that sums it up pretty much perfectly. I appreciate it. "

"A true narcissist does not want people to know that he refused to attend your wedding because you didn't make the proposal all about him circa 1948. This will blow over, and you may want to mention the old ""what will people think of you?!!"", because narcs are very concerned with that sort of thing."

"Also, OP: You edited to say that in general, he gets along with your family. He gets along with them when it doesn't interfere with any of this other plans, and those other plans all come before you.

This is a pattern. A very clear patterns, and like the poster says above, it isn't changing. You went out of your way to correct this problem via your intricate scheduling, and it didn't change anything.

I have never met an older kitty who didn't love to watch his kingdom from a shelf just above everyone's heads. "

You're pinning all the blame on her when you could have just asked the insurance agency for a rental. 
"&gt;How do I stand my ground and not get married to the girl I just proposed to?

This is, seriously, one of the dumbest things I've ever heard of. Make a non-legal commitment to each other if you want but leave the proposing off the table then. Being engaged is about getting married, not staying together for 23 years."
"I would get a bit out of town before doing that OR have a new phone already working and lined up. He may follow you out of the property and get physical. You need to be able to call 911 if needed. 

Hell OP could even call for a police escort and have them help her out. They will walk her off the property safely. You can do it even if he isn't home, just state you fear he may come home. "
"This is a VERY manipulative behavior on her end. It's a really shitty thing to do to a partner. She wants you to just *know* what's she's thinking of that will make her feel better. That's an *unrealistic* expectation that leaves you no way to win. 

You need counseling or this relationship will not survive. She's refusing to communicate and without effective communication the foundation crumbles. 

At this point I would have one last conversation. Apologize for hurting her feelings again. Explain that it wasn't your intention. Ask for forgiveness. If she won't then ask what you need to do to be forgiven. If she *still* won't give you a way disengage. Tell her you refuse to play this game anymore. You aren't a mind reader and it's unrealistic for her to think you can just *know* what will make it better. That at this point *she's* the ones who doesn't want to make this better.  I would be prepared with the ultimatum of couples counseling. 

Just know what she's pulling is not okay. "
"8 years of your life is a HUGE investment for anyone to make to another person. Of course he didn't want to believe it and grasped at any straws he could that could discredit OP. Doesn't make him a bad guy, just a hurt one. AND he later apologized to OP.

I've had a friend that was in a relationship for 5 years and their partner flirted and cheated, but also confessed immediately due to guilt. He chose to argue and disagree that she wasn't a bad person and she must not be remembering correctly. How is that for logic? Direct confession, not from some other friend that caught them. 

What more do YOU expect from OP's friend?

"For those of us not yet married or with children, 

Did he start this behavior after the baby was born? Were there things you ignored or let go that you wish you hadn't? When you decided to have a baby with him, was it a mutual decision? Was he excited?

Your story is just... so scary for me (and I'm sure many others who aren't married yet.) I would love to learn from you."
"Okay.

A) You two are obviously not sexually compatible, and you are taking it personally. Either you have less sex than you want, which isn't fair, or someone is being pressured to have more sex than they want....which isn't fair.

B) Even low libido people masturbate and look at porn. Once a week is not that much, and if he isn't a sexual person, it would make sense that he would want something quick and easy. 

C) I think you are blaming porn unfairly for being the problem in your relationship. It's not. One day of porn a week is not the problem. One day a week of porn is not ""putting all his effort"" into it. The problem is that you two are on very different levels sexually. 

D) You want your version of a healthy sex life, and accuse him of ignoring your needs. While doing this, you are also ignoring his needs and his version of a healthy sex life. This is where the incompatibility comes into play. 

E) Instead of trying to control his sex drive, masturbation, and porn use to suit your needs, have you considered just finding someone who is compatible with you rather than trying to force it out of him?

"You should really find a ""thing that you do"" that doesn't involve mildly hurting people.

Reminds me of a post awhile ago where a kid and his friends were throwing glass bottles against a wall for fun, and then his brother walked around the corner and a shard of glass hit him in the eye and permanently blinded him.  Or another topic where a kid would always ""try to nut"" his brother by kneeing him in the balls.  You know, as a joke.  Then the kids testicle was damaged and had to go to the hospital and have it operated on.  Stuff like this are ""fun"" until they go too far and hurt someone one."

"TL;DR Kids is the ultimate deal breaker. If you can't agree on it you need to break up. 

I know you want to hang on for the sake of everything you've shared but this is not something you can just let lie and eventually it will get better. You can't compromise on kids, there's no ""everyone gets their way"", this is an all-in situation. 

You only have so many years to have kids, so if you want them you need to be with a partner that is on board with that. It's time for a good talk with your husband. Tell him that not having kids is a dealbreaker for you and that if there is no chance of him changing his mind then the two of you will need to divorce. 

There's a chance he will change his mind when you discuss this, but there's probably a bigger chance that he will not. In that case, you really need to break up and separate as soon as possible. You will resent him if you try to forget about having kids. If you fall pregnant anyway (please please avoid this) he will resent you. 

Your relationship cannot survive a fundamental disagreement on this level, I'm sorry. "

"My first experience with a dog was when I was about 5 or 6.  We picked up a stray that had been dumped out at the end of the long rural road we lived on by his owners (WTF #1).

We only had the dog a short time because he barked a lot, I guess, and it annoyed the neighbor enough that one night he went out and shot the dog in the head (WTF #2).  This man also took his family's own mother cat and her fresh new kittens and drowned them in the river down the road (WTF #3).  We had ended up rescuing one of the kittens around the time the others went missing because he kept coming over to our back deck to beg for food.  Little guy was literally starving (WTF #4), not figuratively, so we took him in.  He was a great cat for a long time.

I was really young, so I don't know what happened to the guy, if anything."
"Your husband isn't ""a bit of a flake."" He's a manipulative, exploitative douchebag who's been treating you like his personal maid and meal ticket for the entirety of your relationship. I wouldn't surprised if his cancer story was totally made up to get you to feel pity instead of resentment toward him.

Kick his ass out and file for divorce. Your kids will be better off going back and forth between two households than living with a mother and father who quietly hate each other."
No. Do you want to be the bench player? Or the starter to your relationship? Bench players get traded. Starters get the max contract and live a happy life in the hall of fame. Move on. 
"I get uncomfortable playing competitive games. I don't really like the feeling of being competitive. I love playing cooperative games, though.

The Pathfinder card game, Pandemic, Forbidden Island, Sentinels of the Multiverse... those are the only cooperative board/card games that come to mind immediately, but I'm sure there are more.

EDIT: Oh, the Legendary games are pretty cooperative if you can agree to ignore the point system at the end."
"You've had some great suggestions; I'll throw one more into the mix. I had prenatal depression/anxiety - we hear a lot about postpartum, but it can happen before birth, too. Irritation with those around you is definitely a symptom (my irritation was intense and irrational), and often irritated people will take it out on the people closest to them while managing to hold it together for people who aren't quite as close. I'd recommend googling to see if some of the symptoms might fit what you know of your wife's emotional state lately (obviously you can't see inside her head, but some of it might be obvious.)

Of course, I can think of nothing more irritating than ""hey hon, do you think you might be grappling with mental illness right now?"" even if this does end up being a likely cause...but prenatal depression/anxiety puts you at very high risk for postpartum &amp; it's important to be monitored...not to mention, treating it makes pregnancy much more bearable. It might be worth having a discussion about it if it seems like a likely cause. And if I'm way off base, well...that's one thing to rule out. "
"&gt; naming a few things that I was sure were making me angry with concrete examples of when they'd happened

Don't do that. When something bothers you, say it immediately, don't make a mental list you pull out when you're really pissed off. Can you give a few examples of those things?

&gt; Over the past couple months I've lost all desire for sex with him

Personally, I think it's a fallacy to believe that making a guy behave like you want him to behave will ever increase your attraction towards him. If you don't want to sex him any more the attraction is already gone. For the future, communicate early, don't let this happen again."

"I am not sure, because either way she went after him to the bathroom to see if the toilet have been used"
So she was still protecting her own best interests over telling you the full truth.
You should have proactively broken up with her when she went radio silence on you. That's unacceptable behavior in a relationship.
"Uh, if it doesn't come naturally to you, you are overthinking it.

"I feel like doing the math on this, just for fun.  I come from a fairly large family. I have four siblings, three of them have spouses, and, between them I have six nephews, and of course two parents. My husband's family is smaller, but he has a brother, nephew, niece, and mother. Plus us two and our daughter. We don't actually live close enough to do so, but assume that we celebrate all 21 of those birthdays, and (also not true) that none are close enough for joint parties.

A slice of Costco birthday cake (a very typical cake) is 260 calories. But hey, serving sizes are often pretty small, so let's say I have two slices per party.  Times 21 birthday occasions, that's 10920 calories. A pound of fat takes about 3500 calories to gain. So over a whole year, I could gain 3.12 pounds from cake.  Admittedly over a lifetime that would pile up, but seriously that is *so* not what's causing an 80 lb problem! And that's assuming a heck of a lot of birthdays and a large portion of cake at each."
"Oh my god, don't quit, don't be ashamed. Yes it's a little tacky to spread that information around, and you found out how people can get about it. It's not some huge mistake though, it's not a national secret, and your employers treating it that way only reflects badly on them. Absolute secrecy about pay only benefits them, and you're under no obligation to play along with it. 

Putting it bluntly, you're young and inexperienced or we wouldn't be having this conversation. Your boss has judged correctly that she can push you around. We've all been there. 

If you have to talk with the branch officer, apologize once (and only once!) for causing an uncomfortable situation. Don't try and offer to make it right, for gods sake dont offer to resign. If they want to get rid of you, they can fire you and pay unemployment. 

It's a good chance to start learning some business skills. (And yes, by the way, not sharing your salary is one of them!)"
"&gt;This has been explained in other comments, but I will explain again. 

&gt;I may be invaluable in terms of the relationship we have, BUT if MY WIFE can't depend on me to be there when SHE needs me in times of crisis, I know SHE will consider looking for someone who will. It's the lack of loyalty from the perspective of my SPOUSE. I SHOULD know how SHE WILL feel about anything less than what SHE thinks is 100% commitment.

Your job is in a critical crisis situation. Your wife is in a critical crisis situation. The two are in direct conflict with each other. You are choosing your job. You are letting her know that any other time she needs you, you will only ever be there are as long as something more important doesn't come up.

The fact that you can even entertain the idea of leaving her alone for the birth and alone with a newborn for an indeterminate amount of weeks says everything about your priorities that needs to be said. If you're the manager of a subdivision of a company, you have enough skills to transfer elsewhere. I sincerely doubt you'll wind up on the streets. Grow a spine."
"There is a lot of dwelling in your post, try not to be self loathing on yourself."
Can you ask for a 5 minute break to call him? If this isn't ordinary behavior for him you really need to find out if he's ok. You might be the only person he's in regular contact with and who knows he's been incommunicado for 4 days. 
As I explained I'm another comment I witnessed the cat destroy it. The cat was sitting in the desk drawer and when he picked thr cat up out of it he peed inside the drawer. My fiance wasn't home and hadn't been for several hours.  
"You told him you didn't like the haircut, and maybe that ought to be enough. 

But if you haven't already, you should tell him that you don't just dislike the haircut. Tell him you think it's awful and tacky and embarrassing and makes you lose all sexual attraction to him. And close by telling him that you really, really want him to whack off the mullet.

Whatever hurt feelings he might get from this will he far less than the hurt feelings he will get if you dump him. 

And if he still refuses to cut his hair after that, I guess that tells you what you need to know. I can't imagine any haircut that I'd be determined to keep if my husband put it to me in those terms. "

2. Move out.

Tell your husband how obnoxious he's being. I'd also warn him against harassing someone who kicks ass for a living.
"&gt;I also don't know what to say when he inevitably asks why I have an issue with his use.

Dude you do NOT need to DEFEND having a problem with abuse of cocaine and other drugs. 

This is not about getting into a debate and defending a position. Nor is it about coddling his feelings.

This is simply about making it perfectly clear that this a deal breaker for you. That's all he needs to know. What he does with that info is up to him.

Honestly, I'd plan on walking away from this guy completely, but that's just where my own personal line is. "
Possible b12 deficiency. Go to your doctor and get bloodwork done. You sound like a good person. &lt;3
"OP, it's probably best if you move out as soon as possible.

"When people are a couple they are pretty much a package deal, and it is pretty hard to hang out with only one of them.  It would be equally weird for them to cut you out or you all to cut out the SIL while everyone else spends time together.  Anyhow, it really does not sound like they want to spend any time with you, so maybe it is best to start adjusting expectations."
"
You don't know if this is a hill to die on.... do you seriously think that your relationship can survive this? From the sounds of it your sister doesn't really care if you die on this hill, the next or down the road by a dumpster - and this is after you put your life on hold and drained your finances to look after her."
"&gt;My question is you don't just proposition someone for sex, and something must surely have happened beforehand?

Not, really no. Plenty of people proposition others for sex without any previous sexual encounters with them. Hanging out at a bar proves this. 

You've just assumed what she told you isn't the truth, so obviously, there are some trust issues on your end here. 

Has she put up boundaries? Does she still hang out alone with him? "
Tell him you're uncomfortable with what he did and you don't want him to do it anymore.

"You said you ""can't imagine living like this forever."" And you also said she won't see a therapist even though she clearly has a serious mental health issue: makeup obsession being even more important than getting to a family member who might be dying. What if you were the person who critically needed her quickly? is this a relationship you want to stay in? You may need to make a clear decision."
Could you and your sisters chip in and maybe get a pet walker to visit the dogs and walk/play with them a few times a week? It sounds like their life would be so much better with some attention from someone.
Yeah if she is a real estate agent this is on the short side.
"It is good that you blocked her. But also keep your social media on private. Make it so that only friends/family can see it, and even then don't post everywhere you go/everything you do.

This sounds like more than a coincidence to me, especially because you live in NY. It is not like you live in a small town with 2 bars and a bowling alley. 

If she continues to show up where you are, I would seriously consider contacting the police just so that they are aware. Your safety is priority 1 here. "
Probably because her family was actually grieving.

Do you plan on having kids together? Have you talked about how your families are going to be involved when you have kids? Will you continue to skip holidays at his family's place?

"The best thing for you to do is cut off personal ties - like invting her over or bonding over hobbies - and maintain professional ties - like smiling when you see her in the laundry room.

"This is financial infidelity. What she's done to your credit rating is the fiscal equivalent of giving you an STD.

I think you need to reframe the issue here. It's not ""How do I keep my wife from getting mad at me""? It's ""How do I remain married to a liar who repeatedly cheats on me with Discover, Visa and Mastercard?""

If she gets mad, go gray rock. Don't give her the satisfaction of flying off the handle -- that lets her turn herself into the victim. Just remain calm, tell her that her out-of-control spending has actually threatened the roof over your head, tell her that her actions have proven she's not trustworthy, then ask her to explain why you should continue the marriage as it is. Tell her that her lying and her compulsive spending are two behaviors that are ruining the marriage, and ask her what she plans to do to fix all the messes she's made.

She'll throw fits. She'll attend to all sorts of dramatics. But stay on point, don't deviate from the main points of ""You broke your word to me. You have been lying repeatedly. You jeopardized our house. Your spending is out of control. I don't trust you. I expect you to own this problem and fix it.""

And I hope, if you do decide to remain married to this spendthrift, you make marital counseling and individual counseling conditions of remaining married."

"They clicked because they haven't seen each other in a really long time. The conversations you and your girlfriend are having are 10x more valuable to her than anything they could be connecting on. Conversation goes stale sometimes when you date someone for 2+ years.

It's really easy to get jealous or suspicious but it's valued more if you work to trust that she isn't doing/saying anything to jeopardize the relationship. You can overthink sometimes but don't let it get to you! Just keep working on strengthening what you have.

"It sounds like abortion would be a good option.  That is what I did in a similar scenario and I am so glad it did!  Such a feeling of relief after.

But if you decide that you want to raise a baby right now, then start planning and tell him sooner than later. It's not going to get any easier.  Also, it sounds like you barely know this guy.  If he doesn't want to be in the picture, then you need to know that now.  That will require a lot more work on your part, especially if you need to go after him for child support.   Also, tell your parents since this is their problem now too.  There is no way you are going to do this on your own for $700/month...so better break the news so they can plan accordingly to help support you.

There is always adoption, but if you decide that route, get yourself a good therapist.  It's pretty heart wrenching for most women.  You'll also need to start working with agencies NOW.  If you wait until the last minute, there is a good chance the baby will end up in a state home for the first few months of it's life.  Adoption is a long, drawn out process.

"I think you are doing pretty great at calmly handling your parents' horrible behaviour.

I've been disowned about four times. They always came crawling back when they realized I literally didn't care if I talked to them or not. The threat of being disowned is supposed to make you freak out and desperately appease them by doing whatever they want. When you don't do that, in my case anyway, they start calling again. It never lasted longer than four or five months with mine.

With parents who want to make you be something you're not, you really just have to take a very firm line. Enforce your boundaries ruthlessly; never justify, argue, defend or explain; if their speech or behaviour is out of line, disengage; show them that if they behave poorly, they don't get to have you around, but when they respect you and are nice, you will hang out with them.

It's hard but necessary if you have parents who are insistent on manipulating or coercing you into doing things you don't want to do."

"I'll say this: my sister and I weren't close until really this year. She's older. I NEVER did anything like what your brother did/still does, but hear me out.

You mention you ignored him all through high school. As a younger kid, there's nothing more damaging. I know in my head that my sister's not a god, that her approval isn't what matters and I don't really need it, but try convincing an 11 year old of that. All I wanted was for her to fight with me or go to a movie with me or anything *on either side of that spectrum,* but we legitimately  exchanged maybe a few words a day until she moved out of the house. I'd walk into a room and she'd leave it. I'd say her name to ask a question and she'd bark ""what?"", no matter what the question or tone was or how long I'd waited to ask it.

The few times we talked nicely weren't enough to make up for a childhood of being made to feel like the obnoxious little kid far after I was able to be my own person, who she could have talked with (like all of my friends' siblings). My friends would mention not getting along with their siblings because they'd fought at the movies or their sister had stolen a shirt. My sister and I didn't go close enough to each other to ASK about a movie. It made me feel like absolute fucking shit for a long time.

I'm not your brother and I don't get her into trouble. I've accepted that we're on good terms, and now (I'm 21, she's 25), we're friends. We chat on Facebook every week at least, and we get coffee when the family is together on vacations. But I have to be honest and say that it's taken me a long, long time to accept that she anything like accepts me. Long after I've made my own healthy friendships and started healthy relationships (proving to myself that I am in fact worthy of respect as a person), I still shrink from her at the slightest annoyance, which isn't fair for either of us. Last year I overheard her telling our mom that she wished I'd open up to her, and I realized that I was polite, friendly and distant every time I spoke to her out of genuine fear that she'd get annoyed at me, because I'd been conditioned to. 

Some of that was me and some was just her. She did yell at me a lot, and still takes out annoyance at the family by treating me like a little kid, and it cuts me down every time. She once made fun of me at home to my crush, who she knew, then told me he said she was cooler. She babysat for a good friend of mine and her younger brother for awhile when we were little, then would come home and tell me how much she liked my friend, then continue to completely ignore me. That kind of thing; not huge, but designed to hurt (and effective). It made me trust her very little.

Your brother is being ridiculous. I'm just trying to give you a sense here, I'm not excusing him. But please understand that older siblings' teasing can fuck you up for good, especially if like me you already have insecurity issues and she's the golden child. And please understand too that I'm not a shrinking violet in any other relationship in my life: I'm smart, I'm social and have lots of friends. But in this one thing, trust is coming fucking slowly. Understand that and be kind if you can, please."
"Your husband also has to think you're on a team thought and it doesn't sound like he does. If he won't stand up for you, you have to stand up for yourself. It won't benefit your relationship to enable him and you'll grow to resent him. "
This is one of those times I wish i could hear the other side. Since I cant though I'll say just keep working on yourself and your mental health. And maybe be open to another discussion about the way your brother sees your relationship. IS it abusive? I'm worried because if you're vulnerable and use to being treated a certain way you might be willing to put up with things you shouldn't have to. 
Sometimes you need to hide your power level. They may just end up not wanting to play with you anymore.
"Yeah, but that kind of black and white thinking is what leads to this kind of thing in the first place. OP of course doesn't think that his girlfriend is a bad person. Therefore she isn't the type to cheat. His girlfriend probably thinks of herself as a good person, so it's ok for her to exhibit this behavior because she isn't a cheater. But if they'd view cheating as a bad trap that any person can fall into if they aren't careful or guarded with their behavior, then they'd be more wary when approaching things like this.

I think the problem lies when people believe that cheating makes someone evil, and surely evil is easy to spot, and I'm not evil to puppies or my mother or anyone at work so I must not be capable of cheating!"

"I saw that you tried to pose this question in another sub. Frankly, it's kind of ridiculous. You are asking a bunch of people to tell you *how your fiancee* should feel about your mother's ring. **She** already told you how she feels. She doesn't want it. Get her her own ring, for god's sake. 

Dude, this is a terrible way to handle a situation that's really, really simple. You are doing everything you can to bolster your own opinion and invalidate your fiancee's. 

The ring is sentimental to *you*, not your fiancee. Your marriage is between you and her. It's not a statement about how you feel about your mother, or an extension of *your* parents. If you can't wrap your head around this, the fact that your fiancee has a right to her own opinion's about *her* life, and *her* marriage, what she wears around her finger every day as a symbol of it, I honestly wonder if you see her as a separate human being at all.

" No you should not insist her sister get used to you being there while she is going through chemo. Stay away from her room at the hospital &amp; wait outside to pick your GF up.

You're making some big mental jumps here to make this about you. 

This is all about you being put out, because you miss your GF. Your GF actually wants you to stay away too, it seems. Respect this difficult time, you will need to be there for her if her sister doesn't make it &amp; she probably won't want to keep up with housekeeping duties if she is grieving.

Everything she dislikes disguised as concern. I have heard a lot of the same things that your mom is putting in the letters. She goes around to other family members and gossips and tries to convince them that the person is bad too. Especially with my latest relationship. Everyone pretty much just rolls their eyes and ignores her. It's still pretty frustrating. 

I have had to go very low contact with her just for my own sanity. My mother is very controlling and is very mean when she doesn't get her way. She's manipulative as well. It's just easier for me to keep her out of the loop. "

"Most people here are missing the point. Yes, expecting daily sex from a 60M is unreasonable. But let's imagine it said 36M in the title instead of 60M. Would it be reasonable to throw tantrums because you are not getting daily sex?

The problem here is OP, not her husband's age. As a woman I, too, have been indoctrinated to believe that all men everywhere want sex all the time and if they are even a little bit attracted to their partner they are always ready to go in 0.4s. But as a 34 y.o., I know that this is not true. Men are not sex machines; they're human beings. So sometimes they are tired, sometimes they are sad, sometimes they are thinking of videogames/football/work/the reproductive cycle of shrews instead of sex, and sometimes they want to but their body will just not cooperate. 

Erections =/= Love. Not erections =/= Not love. It's as simple as that. OP needs to stop equating love and sex, and a therapist is probably the best answer."

"Yeeaah, just the ""bare minimum"".. to get an A?  

I don't think you read everything she wrote.  She did say that the exemption was only for thise who had an A average, and that her grade was almost identical to the one who got the exemption.  The professor also said that class was NOT required.  If she was managing to pull off an A average and still miss class here and there, I don't think she was ""want(ing) to do the bare minimum"".

But you probably know her inner thoughts FAR better than she does, right?

There's always someone.."
"So I had a similar issue with my girlfriend recently. 

We both go to school - I work as a resident advisor, so I have a room on campus in a first year residence hall. This job also requires me to work events, plan things, and various other community responsibilities. 

She has a job that is less intensive, and we are on the same academic path(similar engineering majors). 

During the first part of the year, she would tell me constantly that we were not spending enough time together. I would argue back, ""we consistently spend 5 nights a week together, as well as doing x, y, and z."" She would argue that while we spent the time together, it was not that time she was talking about. I spend alone time in my days working on projects and schoolwork, sometimes sleeping in because I have to go to bed after finishing my homework at 2-3am, and doing various job related tasks. She would ask ""why can't I spend that time with you?"" and I would answer ""because I need to do x, y, and z."" 

It was a constant cycle where I got the impression that she didn't really care about the time we spent together - just that there was time we weren't spending together that we could be in her mind. I expressed that to her. 

It turns out, she wasn't really looking for more time together, just to be doing more things with our time that are intimate. For example, instead of watching a show/doing homework and busy work, just watching a show. Or going out to eat instead of picking food up at the residence hall meal areas. 

Have you tried engaging her in different ways? 

Many people who are introverted in that sense really aren't looking to pursue hobbies or do their own thing - they need you to ask them. "
"&gt; Megan mentioned that her, and another girl in the program named Tara, had been sleeping with Eric on and off for the last 3 months. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Megan went on to tell me that they knew Eric was in a relationship, but they thought it was more of a FWBs/friend thing, rather then an ""actual"" relationship. 

IDK it seems it's their fault too!"
"You need to take some time away to re-evaluate what you want. None of your explanations about what happened justify your actions. As her significant other, you are meant to respect and protect her. You did not. You allowed another woman to have a level of intimacy, whether it ""wasn't sexual"" or not, that only your girlfriend should have. 

For the sake of her emotions, tell her. Let her decide what she wants to do with that information. As for you, learn boundaries. Unless explicitly told by your partner, I would say 99.999% of physical contact with someone who /might/ have interest in you is a no go. "
"Your BF should be sticking up WAY HARDER for you, honestly. Like, every time they say something he should be calling them out. ""Mom, that's not appropriate."" ""Dad, do you realize that's a stereotype?"" In private, he should be sitting them down and having a very long, serious discussion about the appropriate way to approach racial differences and what may/may not be offensive to others. If he's not willing to do that...then you need to decide if you're willing to accept this as part of your life forever, because nothing is going to change. 

Plus, y'all have only been together for 2 and a half years...why is it a big deal if you spend the holidays apart?  I'm an Asian F and my SO is a White M, we're in the same age range as you and your SO, we have been dating for about the same time as you and your SO. We live together and for the past 2 holiday seasons we've gone back to visit our respective families on our own. We celebrate Christmas together the week before, then spend the actual day with our families. Why would he be offended? It's totally normal for you to want to see your own family, ESPECIALLY given the fact that his family is like this. 

Additionally, my SO's parents are absolutely ""meat and potatoes"" Midwestern types (stepfather is a volunteer police officer and construction worker, parents love to go hunting and gave us deer meat they shot themselves last year, etc etc). They have **never** done any of the stuff you've said here. This is not cool, period.  I'm sure you know this already but I just want to validate you and emphasize that their background is not an appropriate excuse for them (or your bf) to fall back on. "
"If a second party acts aggressive for no reason at all, your priority is not to deescalate, your priority is to get out of it unscathed.

"Yep. This is spot on. My parents aren't nearly as bad, but they were SO crabby growing up. Actually, the entire reason my brother and I moved out when we did was because we were sick of them getting into bad moods and projecting it onto us. My parents never understood why I didn't watch TV downstairs with them at night, but it was because they were such moody jerks that I didn't want to be around them. 

My dad has always been someone who will become angry over the smallest shit. Don't even get me started on how angry he used to get at the computer DAILY, but they were still using dial-up when nobody was anymore.

Anyway, I went over to their house not long after moving out. My brother was still living there. We are getting ready to sit down for dinner, and my dad is fussing at my brother about something. I tell him it's not a big deal (whatever he was mad at) and to calm down. He doesn't. In fact, me saying that makes him even angrier. I get up, grab my purse, and drive 30 minutes back home. We hadn't even eaten yet, but I didn't care. When I talked to my mom later on the phone, I told her I specifically moved out to get away from their ridiculous bad moods and that I will not visit if they are going to act that way while I'm a guest in their home. It worked. They haven't acted that way since."

Why do you want to be friends with someone who you think mistreated you and refuses to acknowledge it or apologize?
"You need to go to anger management. My parents went through a similar situation (very little money, two young kids, mom not working) and my dad has NEVER sworn when speaking to my mom, let alone at her. 

The level of anger that you get to is totally unreasonable and you expect your wife to manage it for you instead of learning to manage it yourself. 

You do not take responsibility for your anger anywhere in this post. You do a lot of ""I was angry and that's bad BUT IT WAS THE FAULT OF THIS OTHER THING I CANT HELP IT"". 

No. Controlling your anger is always on you. Do you want your kids to grow up always tip toeing around you because they can't tell what is going to set you off? Do you want your kids not to reach out to you when they have problems in case it makes you angry? 

Even before kids can talk they can hear volume and react to body language so they'll know that Dad is scary a lot for reasons they don't understand. "
"""Hey, so I burst in to tears because I found that you had Grindr downloaded on your phone when I went to download that app. What's going on?"""
"It's perfectly understandable that you resent her, but of course you need to make an effort to redirect that where it belongs -- at her father, who is being lazy and self-indulgent and terribly unfair to his daughter.  Perhaps if he could see it this way it might inspire him to change his ways a bit?   He thinks he's being a loving, nice dad but in fact he is being a cruel and irresponsible dad.  His mission as a parent is to prepare her for life as an independent adult, and everything she is learning will make her completely unfit for employment, relationships, or human interaction.  


I dated a guy with kids like this once.  The little girl would be sent to bed, she didn't want to go.  She would scream ""I hate you"" and he would come back to me looking all sad.  I told him to go back and say, ""I""m sorry you hate me but it's bedtime.""  It took a few rounds but eventually she got the idea.   Being a parent means enduring the pain of hearing your kids say that, of enduring the sadness of hearing them cry when they are in a time out, because it's your fucking job to do that."

I'd rather my blissful ignorance. "
The costs should be split. If he pays for the whole thing then that should go toward paying down his other debts to you.
"It's not a silly mistake, man. This is on par with cheating. It's a sexual relationship.

"Hijacking top since I'm surprised no one else said this...

Maybe the problem is that you moved in WAY TOO SOON. Six months? At this stage in the relationship you need time apart, espcially if you're busy with work and school. At your level of business, I'd say spending 2 nights a week together would be acceptable (e.g. one dinner date a week and one weekend day, including overnights). This way, during those date times, you can focus 100% on your boyfriend. Whereas right now you're probably never fully focused on him.

I think the pressure of living together makes it seem like you should be together all the time, but I really don't think that's ideal for your relationship."
Good for you! Sitting here grinning like a nutter :D
"""You should not feel this way"" is not an emotion or a viewpoint. It's a gas lighting tactic."
"No, OP should not take him back under any circumstances.

Edit: I see you said you work out a lot but can never be like him - wrong attitude. Check your nutrition and regimen - I spun my wheels for years until I understood what your body needs to grow - hit those websites as well. Knowledge is power - literally."
"It sounds like she's playing games with people because she likes attention (and she's worried that the attention spigot will shut off if she's seen as unavailable). The only reason that it's going to be awkward for her to tell these dudes she has a boyfriend is probably because she's been giving as good as she's been getting in the flirting arena.

You have a right to establish boundaires and determine what kinds of behavior you're willing to put up with for the sake of a relationship. Frankly, it's not somethign I'd put up with because it doesn't say anythign good about them as a person.

ETA: You could also approach some of it from another angle, not that you don't trust her, but that you don't feel good being kept a secret. You'd like to be able to meet her friends and be open about your relationship, but her hiding it all the time makes you feel like she's embarassed. But how that's going to play depends on her (I'm going to guess not well, sinc eyou've already fought about this bullshit)."

"What I noticed from your post is that you talk about how much your husband needs you, but you do not talk about how much you need your husband.

That is something that should go both ways. You should both need each other. If that need is only going in one direction (so like, he needs you, but you do not need him), then something is wrong. 

Also, just so you know: people who hit dogs often go on to hit their wife or husband next."
"Hell if any shelter will take it give it up 10 months has a good chance at being rehomed because it's young and waiting for a no kill shelter space will likely end with the dog in fit to be rehomed because of issues it develops from the abuse or likely dead from one of her husband's temper tantrum's. Shit Craig's list add ""free to good home"" is a better option than leaving it with her husband at this stage. "
"Yup.

Was your gf shocked by the information you brought to her? Because, if someone I was talking to took my convo as me calling her transgender, I'd be shocked, and debate with you about what I said, and try to understand how she could've come to that conclusion. But, if your gf simply said, ""No, the convo went like blah blah blah"", without any rise or disorientation, she's 99% lying. "
"So, wait, she was pressed to drink until really drunk, 'made out' which involves slapping a guy, and you think this was consensual?"
"Point her to the nearest shelter because honestly, this girl was never your friend. Others are saying she didn't want to rock the boat but what about that virgin comment? I think she was talking shit about you, and that gave him ammo to try and drive you away.

also, if she doesn't leave Chad, you open yourself up to the former dynamic where he is coming around your place and she will not make him leave, and then freak out at you when you call the cops.

Be kind to her yes, but from a distance. Maybe meet her at the shelter if you want to help her get set up. But I think your friendship is over unless she actually does turn around and acknowledge how much she hurt you with her own actions, not just Chad.

It's ok to want to be done with her. It's ok to do the minimum here. She was awful to you on her own, it was not just her bfs influence."

"Shes overweight. Its seen as a non attractive trait. It takes a shit ton of work to lose weight, and OP might not have the time or want to time to put into weight loss. None of that is any of our busniess though. My point is, for whatever reason, OP is overweight and has come to terms with it. She knows shes fat, she knows it's not what most people consider beautiful, and she knows she's not going to be losing the weight. 

You don't have to love something about yourself to be comfortable with it or come to terms with it. OP seems pretty aware that excess weight isn't conventionally attractive.  Poking fun at this is wrong. "

I must be missing something, here: why do you need to figure out whether or not you're going to continue a relationship with someone you don't even like?

"It's your business because she's stuck you in the middle of it and you're now having to keep her disgusting secret.

It really bothers me that your family is pushing you to keep silent.  In some ways, keeping the secret is endorsing it.  Or at least enabling it.  That is a huge burden.

Personally, I'd gather evidence and message the two boyfriends.  They may hate you for it but most people would want to know in their position."
It's totally not fair but that's how it is sometimes :( I cut off my dad's entire family because of cruel shit his two sisters have done (and they still continue to torment us over the Internet 😑). I cut them all off cause they never did anything to help or stop the extreme bullying my aunts cause. Ignoring evil makes you evil as well in my book.

"i am not sure why so many people say you are over-reacting or are self-absorbed.

you put a lot of effort into your boyfriend's birthday. you thought ahead, ordered presents that were both thoughtful and practical (which is par for the course for your relationship), organized a party, and reached out to his friends. 

he bought an item he liked on the spur of the moment, and picked up another item he liked and didn't even present it to you nicely. and he took you out for dinner. that part is nice, at least. but otherwise, he basically just bought himself two presents, and didn't put in any of the emotional labor that you did, thought-wise, time-wise.

there's a chance that, if you felt appreciated otherwise, you would find these gifts lovely. but it sounds like your boyfriend might be falling a little short in all respects. 

and then, when you raised your concerns in a polite, level-headed way and it just went *way* over your boyfriend's head. 

it makes sense to me that you are upset. i would try, again, to make it more clear to your boyfriend what your expectations are.

don't just say ""you're a very thoughtful person but i can’t help but feel like my birthday was an afterthought.""—he doesn't sound like he's been very thoughtful at all. let him know how you really feel—that you hoped he would have planned ahead, that the gifts felt like they were more for him than for you. his reaction will tell you how to move forward."

Methinks she protests too much, but that is her business if she wants to deny that her husband is violent. Overall, it sounds like both of them have a problem with alcohol and acting out when drunk.

You can say directly, she aborted because you weren't ready.

More indirect speak. What are the goals to be reached in those few years? I mean, it sounds like you both have good jobs, you've got a nice house, you're married, the relationship is good. She's obviously ready, so why the wait? And why the fuck haven't you talked with her about the conditions and timeline?

Look, I completely understand that, even if everything is perfect on paper for having a kid, that you're both still young and having a kid is a major lifestyle change (for most people). But, it sounds like you've always known her life goal was to have kids with you. Talk to her (directly!!!) about a compromise that you'd be comfortable with.

Help your brother become independent, get jobs, go to school part-time if you have to, and don't give them any money! Because believe me, when the new wife burns through his money, they will then try to guilt you into paying their mortgage, etc. 

I'm so sorry that your father turned to an awful person in his grief. You don't have to enable his behavior. Tell him you love him and set boundaries to protect yourself. And please save the dog!"
"What would it take to convince you? If there's nothing your boyfriend can say or do to restore your trust in him, then there isn't much point in staying together."

"&gt;I'm also 9,000% sure my ex staged the three break-ins we had in our apartment after one of his friends told me around that time my then bf was trying to sell my prescriptions and his laptop (that I ended up replacing ffs) that were supposedly stolen.

So he sold your prescriptions and his own laptop, then staged your apartment so that it would look like someone else stole them? And then had you replace the laptop that wasn't actually stolen? What a gem.

They say a drunk will steal your wallet and then feel bad about it the next day, but an addict will steal your wallet and then help you look for it."

"Get rid of him. Get yourself to a doctor and get yourself checked out. Your to good for him. You have so much coming in your future and a bright future it will be. Someone who truly loves you. Shares the same dreams and respects you for the beautiful intelligent young woman you are. But the doctor first please. Take care of yourself first make sure he didn't give you anything , yes it's embarrassing but your health is first."
Yeah your boyfriend is acting like a chump about this. It shouldn't be so difficult for him to talk to his friend about not being a disgusting animal. 
"Religious incompatibilities are one of the core incompatibilities that can cause major issues in a marriage. My ex husband was religious. I was not, he knew this when he married me. He held it against me after a while. It was one of the reasons that marriage failed. She did you both a favor by breaking it off. It sucks now, and I am truly sorry OP, but it will be better for you both in the long run to be with someone with the same religious beliefs. "

"I completely agree, I just don't agree with the phrasing.  He should be an adult, he is being passive and child-like.  No one wants a passive partner (hell, that is one of the reasons I broke up with my last girlfriend, I had to make all the decisions and it was a huge power imbalance).  I think, because of that, it hits a sore spot with me, perhaps?

Anyway, we can both agree that a completely passive partner is not good for anyone."
"I'm in the process applying for a Australian residence visa for my spouse right now. It costs $AU7000 (plus additional expenses for medical checks, etc) and we've been working on gathering evidence for several months. In a lot of ways the actual wedding was easier and less stressful.

I can't imagine the US will be any less strict about entrance requirements.

I do think that getting another kind of US visa might be simpler. If he's a recent graduate he could try applying for a working holiday visa."
"I went into this thinking that the kids did this on their own. I'm fat, too, and I know kids can do and say mean things when it comes to weight because they don't know any better. But it sounds like one of the adults put the kids up to it?

Even if your family isn't ok with your weight, making fun of your weight is never ok. That's hella disrespectful. I think it might be helpful to talk to the kids and explain *why* you're upset, because they're probably confused. It could be a chance for them to learn appropriate humour, too, seeing as their parents clearly aren't teaching them.

As for your sisters, I think they know what they did was insensitive. I would straight up tell them ""I do not appreciate jokes or jeers about my weight; it's disrespectful. If you have something to say about it, I would prefer if you would say it face-to-face in a constructive way, or not at all."" You shouldn't have to apologize to them."
"I dunno I feel like telling them their gesture was *kind*, is the same as easing their guilt and giving them the warm fuzzies they're after for attempting a good deed around christmas. Then again I can be a bitter old hag. The rest is spot on though"
"While some couples do sleep apart, the majority sleep together. While sleeping together isn't necessary for every couple, for some it absolutely does build emotional intimacy. Moreover, what X% of couples do doesn't matter if it is hurtful to you. That is what is more concerning to me, that she doesn't seem to care about your feelings at all. That's *very* troubling. She's essentially just dismissing your repeated insistence that you're hurting.

There are practical solutions, like pushing two twin beds together in your room so you're close but each still have a defined space. Those are worth exploring, but first she needs to acknowledge your feelings as important. And yes, counseling would be a great idea."
"I'm not going to lie, I felt creeped out reading that. You've only known her a month. One month. One month and your trying to 'reroll' her hormones? That's not a healthy relationship for her, and it's not a healthy relationship for you.

'We get along fantastically, and have spent many days together.' It's been a month. You met on Halloween, that's only 29 days. That is not enough time to decide that someone is your soulmate. 

'-and fully agree's that we'd make an excellent couple' alright, did you ask her if she thought you two would make a good couple? Because she might have been trying not to be mean, because it's crushing to have someone say ""Ew, no."" She might have been trying to lessen the blow but still politely refuse by stating she didn't feel any chemistry.

Her partner, who was in the exact same situation? Relationships aren't cookie cutters. All are different. You cannot expect her to suddenly turn around and repeat history. It didn't work out the first time, it won't work the second.

Obviously, if your tortured by watching her life from the sidelines hoping for a relationship, you're not a true friend. You're trying to get into her pants. Your trying to get her to fall heads over heels with you when she has clearly stated she feels no chemistry between you two. A lot of people would love to know that the person they were fawning after wasn't interested so they could divert their attention to someone else who was and stop wasting their time. You have that heads up. 

I can't even give you advice on how to let the friendship progress naturally, because you're dangerously obsessed with a girl you've known for less than a month. Break ties, and focus on yourself for a while, and get yourself in a good, healthy place. Because as I've stated before, this isn't healthy for her, and this isn't healthy for you. "
"Oh nononono, this isn't an issue of ""he's better than me and I'm so jealous,"" your brother is emotionally and physically abusive! Have you told you parents about any of this? PLEASE tell your parents or another adult you trust about his behavior, this isn't something you should have to live with. Also, are you getting help for your mental illnesses? If you aren't already, seeing a therapist is a great first step. Look, it doesn't matter if your brother gets better grades than you or has more friends than you, he's a grade A asshole and that scores him far lower in most people's books compared to having mediocre grades and a less than thrilling social life."
So why do you need reddits help for this immature argument?! This was so petty of BOTH of you 
"I feel like the problem here is less about weight loss and more about the OP feeling like he's just learned his parents' love is conditional on him looking a certain way (whether that's the case or not). That problem isn't solved by losing weight; it just makes it dormant again. There are lots of family members who have posted here out of genuine concern about their loved ones' health, and have gotten good advice on how to approach the subject with kindness and dignity.

Shaming really, really does not work on a food addiction/emotional eating problem, and it sounds like that's what's going on here. If someone's coping method for experiencing negative emotions is to overeat, making them experience *more* negative emotions is only going to perpetuate the cycle. "

"Look man, clearly she had anger issues, but if you make a promise to someone that you're going to pay them rent on the 1st then you need to pay it on the 1st and you should expect that people will be upset if you don't. Late rent IS a big deal and you CAN get evicted, even if you're only a little late. 

There's a big difference between being angry and being abusive. It seems like you're asking where that line is, is that correct?"
"My advice is for you both to break up. If you decide to stay together, you two need counseling. Frankly, I can't see your relationship succeeding at all if you two do not seek out counseling asap, because he will resent you for the dislocated elbow and you will resent him for hitting you and threatening you. That level of resentment is toxic for a relationship and honestly, it is easier to break ties and move on than try to repair that damage."

2. She actually is entertained by the idea of an affair.  She either told you out of guilt or fear you'd find out from someone else. "

"&gt; but now i feel like i was robbed of a decision all those years ago, i feel like those were important details i should have known about.

You're absolutely right, it's not fair that he withheld info from you and essentially deceived you to stay in a relationship with him. It also doesn't help that he never actually confessed on his own and that it took you prying it out of him. 

A relationship very rarely works on lies, especially when those lies build up over years and are major red flags.

Yes, it was in the past. But it doesn't change the fact that it happened and he chose to lie to you about something major for an extremely long amount of time. You deserve a partner who respects you and is honest. 

I would reconsider the relationship and consider leaving. It will be very hard to rebuild the trust and intimacy between you guys if you choose to stay. "

"It's hard to know what's going on from this post, but I have a few ideas to get you started.

Most colleges have free counseling available to students. I found therapy to be very helpful in dealing with my social anxiety and difficulty forming friendships. You may not have social anxiety but could benefit in other ways. I recommend you look into that to get a professional's perspective and advice - going to therapy for a year and a half was seriously one of the best things I did for my social life.

Despite the off-putting name, the book *How To Win Friends And Influence People* by Dale Carnegie is actually about how to hold pleasant conversations and leave good impressions on people. I think everyone should read it. You might find it helpful, I did.

Finally, I have to agree with Kurafujin that you talked only about yourself and barely at all about the other people you are interacting with. You don't mention reacting to others’ contributions to conversations, you only talk about throwing out your own stories. What charities did they suggest? A conversation requires multiple participants and people want you to hear them and their stories more than they want to hear you and your stories. That isn't to say you can't share your stories too, just that you need to establish that you are listening to others and participating in the back-and-forth before you dive in with a new story. It's hard to say but is it possible that you are bulldozing the conversation and making about you instead of being a good listener and equal participant? Conversation is a surprisingly tough skill that I didn't learn at home, I had to read books on it and learn it over time."

"It could work as a fling, in a ""how 43yo woman got her groove back"" kind of way.

But aside from the fact that you may have similar interests, you and she are in completely different stages of your lives. I don't care how mature a 21 year old you may be, who you will be in 10 years, 15 years and 20 years won't resemble who you are now. And she's already been there, done that.

Then as a 21 year old, are you emotionally, psychologically and physically ready to take on a life with a 6 year old? And knowing that the child's needs will and should come first before you?

Then there's the long range factor. When you're in your mid 40's she's going to be pushing 70. And you're still going to be vital and at an age where women, particularly younger women, will probably be very willing and interested in a guy that age who has his shit together, and who will have caught up interest and lifestyle wise to where you've always been. Meanwhile, she'll be entering the phase of life where she will be slowing down, needing more and more medical and personal care, body starts breaking down, etc. Trust me when I tell you the temptation of women your own age at that point will be almost unbearable. And unless you're a douchebag supreme, what are you going to do? Leave a 70 year old woman who has grown to depend on you at that point?

Remember, there is no ""the one"". It's a lie, a myth. There are numerous people out there in the world that you can be blissfully happy and compatible with. You are into this woman right now, that's fine. If you want to have a fling, go for it. But long term, I don't see any way this doesn't end badly."

I get that your right it isn't really winning but seriously? This is obviously bothering her. Let her win sometimes. When someone always wins it can be so demoralizing even chance games seem rigged.

Any game I could play they could beat me at. It suckkkkkkked. All games were pointless because I always lost. I think my mom had a talk with everybody because sometimes rules were bent in my favor and sometimes I got a partner. The point was board games became fun again.

"Just keep ignoring her, block her number. She's rude and mean. "
"Just ignore your mom. She obviously doesn't know what's good for you. Sometimes family makes hurtful and shitty comments, but... no point in fighting them. You are a grown up.

You'll find someone who loves you and appreciates you and your body. This girl obviously did not. Don't respond to any texts or calls. If you keep getting them from different numbers, just keep ignoring them. Eventually she will give up, and if she doesn't then I would contact your phone company about switching numbers. "

Same overly dramatic ""BUT I LOVE YOU I WILL DO WHATEVER"" when breaking up is discussed.

The thing is, you don't WANT to be with someone who has to go through the fucking Ludovico technique to pop a boner for you. This is not about you, it's about him. He has this narrative set up in his head and you are pretty much just a prop. He can rail about doing all this shit in your name but if he truly cared he would have to do any of it to begin with. 

Cut contact, NO REPLYING TO HIM, and if he breaks in again for gods sake, call the police. Oh, and call them the next time he suggests he will kill him self. Grand romantic gestures tend to wither when you have two cops standing over you while a paramedic gives you a sternal rub."
"&gt;September and met a lovely seeming fellow...took a few weeks to finally talk about relationship expectations... 

Ok so I'm guessing we're at about  October at this point.

&gt;a week after that (made him cum xyz) he had never touched me. He had never seen me naked... he didn't really show an interest 

Sign #1

&gt;I could see that he loved me 

No offense but... No? In the span of about a month and bad sex, how are you seeing that? In the refusal to touch you or how he let's you suck his dick and then maybe spends the night with you? 

&gt;I could see that he loved when I touched him

Yeah people usually enjoy free blowjobs that come without any emotional or physical strings. 

&gt;I initiated sex with him. It was lovely to bond with him...he had gotten off every time but he still hadn't even touched me
 
Sign #2
So how is that bonding? He made himself a human dildo to ""return the favor"" and didn't even bother doing a good job.

&gt;He wrote that he loved me dearly 

He's just using words for the sake of it.

&gt;He loved going down on his previous, thin partners but he didn't enjoy giving me head.

Sign #3 That's just a really mean and unnecessary thing to say.

&gt;a few weeks previously he had told me he loved my body when we had sex

This directly contradicts him going all ""dead fish"" when you have sex. He's just using words to use them.

&gt;The next morning he broke into our apartment through the window, sobbing hysterically. He had sent me dozens of facebook messages, pleading with me to not do this. He cried on my bed for over an hour 

 Sign #4
This guy has SERIOUS ISSUES OP. SERIOUS.

&gt;He told me he loves me more than anything and wants to be with me. 

No, he loves having someone who will blow him and treat him affectionately without him having to do anything in return. He is crying over blowjobs. OP, you are clearly intelligent. Don't let the emotional chaos of a sexually lazy and selfish person confuse you. This guy sucks and you can do better.

Also, all of this ""I love you we're meant to be together"" after TWO MONTHS is so irrational and unhealthy on BOTH of your ends. This is a toxic situation with an emotionally unstable person. Ruuuun awaaaaay"
"Those flaws are all very common in teenagers and often work themselves out on their own. Get out of her life dude.

"You do realize people have sex without having feelings for one another all the time..... It's basically the premise of any FWB or hookup situation. 

It's up to his best friend to decide if she wants to share that info with her boyfriend - this isn't OP's decision. No where in OP's post does it suggest that his best friend has acted inappropriately with this former ONS or been unfaithful or disrespectful to her current boyfriend.

"It's possible he might think he's being sincere, and there are LTRs that started out as sexual hookups, but I think the broader issue is that you're not comfortable with how things are going and you have done a good job of communicating that.

The fact that he got angry with you when you turned down sex is the biggest red flag that I see. If he was seriously interested in you as a person with feelings and desires and emotions, he would hear what you are saying and do something with you that did not involve sex. The fact that he is angry that you're refusing sex bolsters the idea that he is, in fact, only interested in you for sex.

The only thing you're doing wrong is listening to his words. You need to be paying attention to his actions--they are telling you everything you need to know."
"My friend is Hmong, and this is something I'd think would come from that culture. Family is very involved, and husbands are especially loyal to their parents. Even to the detriment of his wife.

I'm a huge idealist, but I always remember how many times Picard negotiated from a position of overwhelming strength. Try sweet reason, then when that doesn't work, fire off an incredibly powerful phaser blast, and then offer up sweet reason again."
"I get that.

What she feels is horror and fear. 

Feelings can be irrational and sometimes you just need your partner to listen to you and not to tell you that you shouldn't feel that way, but instead to say ""that must really hurt or distress you."" ""I'm so sorry you're feeling that way."" ""I love you and want you to feel safe and happy.""

Seeing someone you love be violent is FRIGHTENING. Becoming aware in a pretty scary way that people would want to hurt you violently and you'd be powerless to stop it yourself is FRIGHTENING. Of course she's lucky he prevented anything from happening. I'm not saying she's right. I'm saying she's afraid and anxious and probably traumatized, and maybe if he showed some empathy and an effort to understand the way her reality has been affected, *maybe* they can communicate their way through it.

"I agree, it is their wedding. If they want to have their wedding in a tree fort with a ""no gays allowed"" sign, that's their silly choice to make. 

Mom can't change that, can't force them to change that, and frankly shouldn't try to force them to change it, either. But she can still be frank and vocal that she at least does not subscribe to the same discriminatory attitudes that D and F do. 

Retorting that C will always be welcome in her home is a good start, especially with what must have been a whirlwind of emotions running around at that table. But hopefully next Mom will be able to take it even further - e.g. saying something like ""So, D, you're really excluding your sister from the wedding just because she's gay? Is that how I raised you?"" or something like that, and staying at the table to hear a response rather than retreating to wash the dishes. 

It's an awful position for the mom to be in, having to take a side in a conflict between two children... but if someone doesn't retort in situations like this it will just give D/F the impression that being overtly homophobic towards C in front of the rest of the family is okay as long as C isn't in the room.

(Caveat: of course all this detail on how mom reacted was only retold by B, who may be an unreliable narrator...)"

Other relationships may also involve polyamory and S&amp;M does that mean you guys should start that too? That excuse she gave is terrible, just because ""other people do it"" doesn't make it normal. 

That being said, I'm like your wife and I like space/peace/quiet while I sleep &amp; I can't do that with someone breathing in my ear. However I did what a normal person did, which is *talk* to my SO and start wearing earplugs and trying various other options (white noise machine, switching our mattress out for a new one, cutting down on caffeine, working out more, etc).

You're working on being emotionally present for her, she's cut contact with him, you're both doing your best, time to suck it up and get over it. "
"Honestly dude, considering you don't even know this girl, and that your with someone long distance. This isn't worth the risk, I wouldn't be too excited if I was with someone long distance and they  were sparking friendships from essentially a stranger that handed them their number, because in my opinion anyways, people don't approach people and pass out their phone number to be buddies. Even if you make it clear after, their intent wasn't lined up. Just seems like something not worth bothering with in my opinion. Be friends with people you click with naturally, rather than try to find a friendship from something that was intended to possibly lead to something more than that."

"This was my thought too. 

My ex was very reserved. Very non-physical. Rarely said gushing things to me or about me. I broke up with after 14 months because I was tired of feeling like a hotel when he would just occasionally crash at my house. We didn't cuddle. We barely had sex. We didn't go out. We didn't hold hands. And when I finally dumped him he finally said he loved me. But it was too late. So he did care about me. But not in any way that satisfied my personal needs. This is how my father is and why my mom divorced my father. 

My current boyfriend is the polar opposite. He wants to snuggle. Cuddle. Hope hands. Kiss. Be physical. He's the type to compliment. And gush about me and to me. And it fulfills my needs so much better. But some of my friends see it and feel like that would be too much. They don't like holding hands that much. They prefer more time apart. Neither of us is right or wrong. We just have different emotional needs. 

So ignore what others do. What do YOU want for you? Do you wish you snuggled more? Ask him to. Initiate it. Do you wish he held your hand? Hold his. Ask him to. And it's possible if you voice your desires he'll catch on and be more forward. He can't read your mind."

And next time I'm deff telling him to ""ask mommy what it starts with when you get home."" Not dealing with this shit again"
"Only you can answer if it's a deal breaker for you.  
That said, you told him about a skill you learned and his immediate response was to tell you how useless he felt that skill was. Wow, real winner there. Next you should tell him about what you studied in college so he can explain in great detail how you wasted your education.   
People like this tend to be pretty closed minded. Sounds like you found out pretty quickly. Doesn't seem to be much of a purpose of trying to change his mind."

"She is either desperately trying to convince herself that she made the right choice, or she's trying to make you jealous to drum up some competition for her affections. If the former, she's going to stay with him way after their relationship has soured to show all those haters that what she and Dick had was meant to be and she ""couldn't help it."" If the latter, Dick is going to get his comeuppance when she finds another sucker to make her Suitor #2 (or ""Jacob"" if she's a Twilight fan). "

You are correct. He's been divorced twice. Can't imagine why...
Will you please write all of my correspondence for me in the future? This is fantastic!!
"Another thing to consider : change your internet passwords, if you dont know how ask someone to help you check out for anything installed on your computer that could spy on your online routine.

Do you have any friends or relatives that could come and see you at different hours or days, never the same so he's thrown off guard? 

Check what you dispose of, do not throw away any personal info or documents. If you can, dispose of those somewhere else because the way you describe this creep he might have started to look for info on you in your recycling/garbage. 

Do not engage, do not talk to him. 

Ask other neighbors as soon as possible. 
Leave a trace so they know he's a freak."
"&gt;He could've at least said something.

yeah, but presumably he wants your replacement lined up and ready before risking losing you.

"You did the right thing! Well done, OP. "
"One small thing, I agree with your statement that people gossip regardless, which makes me disagree with your idea to mention medical concerns. That's the girlfriend's information to share, if she wants. There's no need to explain himself to anyone, much less people who talk shit behind his back. "
"Unless someone else is into DD/LG, it can come off as a pretty freaky kink and can turn a lot of people off totally. People can be accepting of whips and leather and paddles, but not things like diapers, furries, or DD/LG. 

If he's not into it, it's not likely that he'll ever get into it. It's not really one of those kinks that someone can learn to like. "
"yea, she thought you were friends but you weren't from your side. You had hidden intentions (you wanted to date her) and felt entitled to that (obvious from your reaction). You were never friends. 

What I'm trying to say is that all you did was mask your problems - they never went away and this wasn't a rebound into a dark side of yourself. It was just you being you. You need to talk to a therapist and explore where this is coming from. 
"
"Sounds like your wife is pushing the issue of Sue as an excuse to get back in touch with her ex. You might want to see a marriage counselor before heading straight to divorce, but yeah, this sounds bad."
"This could be part of my frustration, too.  I 'woman up' all the time with regard to cooking and cleaning while also working a full time job.  Then, I take the extra step of feeling like the only adult in the house when I pay the bills and handle all of the typical homeowner things like the mortgage terms and insurance, etc.  He will help out with cleaning up around the house, but I have to explicitly ask him to do something and be specific about it.  Just generally saying ""please clean up the living room"" doesn't accomplish much.  

I really have to wonder if he's just pretending not to know what to do so that he can get out of doing it.  "
"First off SS is not inheritance, it is for the care of the kids. The legal jargon that describes it literally says and its very clear it is not THEIR money, it is money for their CARE. It stops when they turn 18 or graduate high school. Inheritance is not touchable legally by me, that is completely different than SS money and is theirs 100%. That is in an account in their name that accrues interest until they are 18.

Have you ever raised teenagers? They are expensive. They eat more than double what my husband and I do. They have wisdom teeth surgeries and end up in the ER sometimes and play sports and go on school trips that all costs thousands (yes each one of those have cost us thousands per kid which mostly came out of our money as SS isn't providing a whole lot). To save all of their money and not use any of it on their food and extra curricular activities and medical care would mean downsizing the house that fits us and cars and limiting what they are able to do with school and sports and extras. I'm not saying the SS money goes to housing or transportation, I am saying if my income has to go away from that to cover all their extras then it would mean those would be affected. 

The vacation money is out of the lawsuit, not the extra money I make every month. Once that is gone, its gone. We already allocated (or spent) the remaining 90% on things to better the life of the family or provide for emergencies. If I use that money to live off of day to day it will be gone quickly as I would get used to living outside my means and I have no interest in doing that. Once the set aside amount for vacations is gone, there is no more and we won't be doing what we have a couple times anymore. The pain and suffering I went through for years from that accident I feel is worth spending some small part on myself and even that part has half been spent to include the kids.

So the analogy you used is inaccurate here. We are not well off except for the lawsuit which we have been responsible for and have us and our future kids to think about as well and the fact we chose to live in a lower cost of living area, which if either of us lose our jobs we will have to move to a high cost of living area and be pretty standard as our employer is pretty much the only one here that offers positions in our field.

Being a guardian and adoption are two separate things. I did not adopt them and legally am not their parent. They actually will receive much much more in school aid and services having no parents (and  adoption would make me their parent). I am doing as much as I can for them without also sacrificing everything I worked for too because my aunt and uncle made a poor decision."

"Talk this out with a therapist or counselor if you need to, you just found out something that influenced your life, it's understandable that you're shocked and furious.

In the mean time, try not to think of what a great life you might have had (after all, it might've sucked). Try to think of the positives that came out of this life. Ex: I won an award, I got to meet these people who became my friends, I have a job I like, etc."

"I don't think you're being too demanding of him. I'd be upset too. He blew off your plans for the night and that's not fair to you.

I'm hoping that normally an incident so silly doesn't result in your reaction.  Teasing or even noting or asking why you didn't look at tags isn't putting you down.  And going from crying to yelling about it is extreme.  He's got to feel like he's walking on eggshells.

I actually ran into her sister in the parking lot. :) She was leaving and wanted to see what was up because I'm her singing buddy (we're in alumni together). I explained everything to her and she had already told her sister by the time I talked to her. Both are really great ladies.
"I was in a relationship like this once, except I was your girlfriend. Everytime I was conflicted I pulled away or ended the relationship, just to be pulled back in. 

The fact was that him and I weren't compatible at all. If two people are actually compatible, they don't almost break up/take breaks and get back together multiple times within the first year, during the honeymoon period. 

I'm sorry, but you're the rebound. This relationship isn't to her what it is to you. If there's this much bumpiness and fighting in the honeymoon period, when there isn't much to be stressed about, how are things going to be when life gets stressful. What happens if you lose your job? What happens when children come into the picture? What if she has a miscarriage, or one of your children is born disabled? Do you really think it'll be smooth sailing when the honeymoon period isn't even smooth sailing? 

I've dated a lot, had a lot of casual relationships, and have been with my boyfriend for 4 years. What I've learned is that relationships aren't easy, but it is easy to stay together with my boyfriend. We may have disagreements ocassionally, but it's nothing that can't be solved with good communication, it's never a struggle to want to stay. 

It doesn't matter how much you love each other if you both are unable to have a healthy relationship. Love isn't enough to make a relationship work. "
"This looks like a pattern. You watched your mom use ""harmless"" lies to keep your dad in check. Why did she do that? Was it because his reactions were disproportionate? Was she afraid of him? Those should each be red flags in relationships for you.

He has some issues when it comes to gender and equality - and I'm basing that judgement off of his behavior when you earn more than he does. That's not healthy and probably doesn't make you feel very good about your accomplishments. I'm also concerned about the taking way too much care of you when you have a minor cold. Does he treat you like a child in other ways?

I think if you come out with this two him, the best way would be to ask to have a serious conversation. Tell him what you experienced with your parents, because that was your normal for relationships. You've found yourself doing it in your relationship and you want to work on it. I'd confess to the clothing and luxury item thing and inventing tasks. I would not confess to complimenting his looks, just try to scale it back.

There's no way for us to know how he'll take it but let him react how he reacts. He may be hurt or he may understand."
"You said you told him before you wouldn't stay with them again, so don't. If you just go along with it, it tells him you don't really mean it and he's free to ignore your wishes. It's your money too; book the room yourself. Tell him he can stay with them if it's important to him, but you will not. I wouldn't use the dog as excuse, your personal reasons are more than adequate."
"The trick is to remind him to not ask super often. There are other things you can talk about. I always try to veer it into the topic of doing fun things together. Recently, we've been making sure to play some games every night or watch a movie/show to get our mind off of things. Might help to distract him from his problems with his job."

You keep circling back to your obviously unrequited crush like you think by admitting it that it will change the solution to this. Sorry, this is a whole pile of drama that you need to back away from.

F needs to either ovary-up and deal with this dude herself, or be honest with the chick on her own. Hell, you don't know all the details about what happened with F and Q yourself, nor how he is now. She's either consciously or unconsciously trying to activate your inner white knight and put you in the middle of this. There is no reason to for you to do this that can't be linked back to selfish reasons-don't claim ""friendship-and the probability is higher that your motivation will be questioned and you'll lose the friendship. More importantly, she may disregard it so much that she chooses to stay with this douchebag (if that is indeed what he still is). 

Truly sorry about your breakup, but don't let that lead you into a soap opera.   "
"No, don't believe him. Cheaters can totally change and become better people, I've seen it happen. But in my experience even if he doesn't cheat again if you stay with him you'll just end up paranoid and jealous through the entire relationship, he won't even be able to go to work without you thinking something is going on between him and his female coworkers, and you'll be suspicious of all of his female friends. It will turn you into a complete wreck. You're so young, save yourself that pain and find someone you can start fresh with. 

I also absolutely hate it when people take back cheaters because it stops them from experiencing the consequences of their actions, so they never have the motivation to change. A drunken one night stand maybe, but if someone is a chronic cheater they won't change unless they get a huge wake up call."
"Damn, as a mom, that would not fly with me. If he gets benefits from living in her house, he needs to be civil and polite to household members. Is she paying for his phone or letting him use wifi?  Paying car insurance etc.?  If she's doing stuff for him and turning a blind eye to him being an asshole, she's enabling him.  It's not good for the family, and especially not good for his development into a man. 

Maybe he should go stay with his friend until they get tired of his freeloading ass. Then he'll realize he didn't have such a bad deal living at home for the low price of civil behavior. "

"I would tell your dad.  They're not going to feel disgusted with you.  You were targeted by an older guy who took advantage of your inexperience to use you as a weapon against your dad.  Yeah, telling your parents will suck but better they learn it from you than be blindsided by it later."
"Tbh, responses like the ones in this thread are part of why I'm so hesitant to come out to my straight bf of a year.

I don't think you should feel obligated to tell him.  Like you said, you're not interested in having romantic or sexual encounters with anyone but him.  However, if you feel like being bi is an important part of who you are, you'll have to decide which is less bearable--for you to keep a part of yourself hidden from someone who you love or risk changing, even losing, your relationship with him."

At the very least, you should let him know your intentions. You shouldn't lead him on.

So if the little one likes plastic crap, give her plastic crap. Your sister in law is still an ungrateful brat for complaining and a jerk for sending abuse to your boyfriend but next time just buy the cheap plastic crap"

No, honey, no he's not.  I know you think he's The One and the Love of Your Life and the world Just Misunderstands Him Because OMG He is So Sensitive...

No.  Just no.  You won't believe us, but he's only going to get worse.  Wait until you have to prove where you've been all the time.  Wait until you have to give up all activities that might involve men--even school will become problematic because there are men in your classes and, well, they *might rape  you!*  Or *you might develop feelings for them!*

He'll grill you about who you talked to and what you talked about and then accuse you of cheating.  Boy howdy, just wait until he accuses you of being a whore!

"Not everyone needs friends. 

I don't have like any. I had one and then her boyfriend was shitty and I got sick of picking her up of the floor when he broke up with her, so I distanced myself from her.

I have facebook friends. My bestfriend lives several states away and we talk every few months. 

I wouldn't mind my boyfriend going out with his friends and leaving me at home because I really enjoy being alone at home. I can relax and fart loudly at my desk while watching shitty sitcoms that he hates. 

I work from home and rarely leave the house and that works really well for me. I hang out with family and talk to work folks on messengers. 

So don't assume (not that you are, you said she knows she needs friends but didn't say she WANTED friends) she is hurting for friends. She might be happy with the way things are. "
Tell your sister these are the services and write her an invoice for the amount. Send the lawyer a copy. Tell your sister you will write the other side to reduce the amount because your sister lied about the cost.

You cannot be around her anymore. It's not safe for either of you. 
"&gt;He tells me all the time that I’m not using the appropriate tones, even though I can remember clearly that I have been nice and mellow. This has happened so many times now and I feel so crazy!

If you feel, after honest reflection, that you're not using some kind of tone then consciously or unconsciously he's fucking with you. Tone-policing is poisonous because it puts the other person on the defensive regardless of context and forces you to have to deal with those accusations (and watch yourself extra carefully) on what is essentially spectral evidence. If he's used tone-policing in the past to good effect (and it seems like he has because it shuts your argument down and makes you start apologizing) it's made him pick it up as a go-to cudgel when you two go at it.

It can be really hard to recover from this, but one thing to do is to try and give one another the benefit of the doubt when it comes to tone (which is easier said than done). If you can't hit that reset, you have to decide how long you want to walk on eggshells."
"Staying silent never helps the opressed only the oppressor. I could not be with someone as cowardly as your boyfriend. I'm sure Brock Turner's parents didn't want to see him as a rapist yet that's what he is.

You told her that anymore lying by omission would be the last straw, but she did it anyway. And honestly, someone who is routinely going to lie about hanging out alone with other guys, doesn't sound like someone you can trust anyway. If you bring consequences to the table now, you're only going to be showing her that she can indeed keep doing these things. 

She's shown that she cares more about 'closure' than your relationship, I know what my decision would be."

I suggest showing Allie this Reddit post and let her do the talking. When something like this happened to me, my husband (then boyfriend) coached me about what I should say or do, and it felt good to stand up for myself and shut down the older guy who was hitting on me and stalking me. It also solidified our relationship further, because I knew he had my back and trusted me, and he knew he could trust me to handle myself.

"As the oldest black daughter of white parents, this type of adoption makes me rage. You're amazing OP. Get your Ivy League education and become a doctor. 🙏🏾💯 also I highly recommend therapy once you get in school it should be part of campus counseling services. "
"Yep. If he is touching OP sexually when she doesn't consent, and says ""no, stop"" that's sexual assault. Maybe they should go together to the police station to get a clear ruling on whether he is 'rapey' or not. Or maybe ask his mother. "
"Honestly, my husband keeps financial information like this (except on his computer) so it's not that unusual. "
Learn to love yourself dude. 
"The son is an adult. She can't go after him for child support. The son might still be able to, but doubtfully as OP didn't know about him and he's probably not listed on the birth certificate."
Is it possible that Tristan is questioning his sexuality?
Do both of these women think you are exclusive? Because I'd say the first step is making sure all adults involved know what happened.

"I don't think your sister has the right of it. That's the romantic comedy, Disney movie version of love. I've been with my husband for about five years now and I'm your age and I get where you're coming from. There are still moments when I wonder if I made the right choice, I think those moments are normal. Infatuation does fade, or sometimes it was never really there to begin with, that's fine too. Some people sort of skip that phase altogether. 

If your sister honestly thinks the only relationship worth having is one where your heart still hammers when you see them, she's in for shock when she realizes those feelings fade eventually. My husband doesn't make my heart race when I see him and that's fine. I'd rather be bored with him than excited with anyone else. Sure, he irritates me sometimes. Much like your husband he put on extra weight and doesn't help as much around the house. But he has the best heart of anyone I've ever met and he's essential to me.

Interestingly enough when I was getting married my mom told me if I could make it past year seven, I could make it through the rest of our lives. I think you can make it through year seven.

Don't be afraid to talk to him about it. He might have the same fears. Or in talking to him you might be reminded of why you fell in love with him in the first place. Maybe re-read your wedding vows or look at wedding pictures, something to remember how you felt when you pledged your lives to each other. And ask yourself if you would trade that feeling for butterflies in your stomach. "
"Long term harassment of an ex is a good indication that you too can expect the same treatment. He sounds psychologically abusive, and you're probably better off moving on before it's too late. "
"... yes, you should tell your wife, why is this even a question??"
Not to mention tell her who's harassing her so she possibly start RO proceedings against him.
"&gt;The reason why I want a year off is so I can read up on what essays and papers need to be written so I can get into the college I want to go to and make sure they're perfect and spic and span.

What else are you planning on doing for a year? It doesn't take a year to write college essays. Delaying your application process is also going to put you up for admission against equally qualified students who didn't take a year off. 

Unless you're going to be interning in your chosen field for experience, or doing some other valuable  endeavors, this is going to be a tough sell. "

We also moved in together at 23 and 27.  Real life fairy tails are less dancing in the rain and more he brought home a tiny pumpkin because he remembered you mentioned off hand how you wanted a pumpkin.

Yes. When a girl is against her boyfriend watching porn it's a huge red flag. 
"He's obviously selfish and immature. School is very important to your future, especially at this point in time.  You'll find a better guy soon enough, just move on. "
"Yeah, was she a wreck in the months sexting the guy,  prior to her getting caught?"
"Take your vacation and put lots of pictures from it on Facebook  where these people will be sure to see them. Then don't give them another thought. There is not one teeny tiny thing they can do about how you handle your own money except gossip. 

But if the gossip rises to the level of slander, and it sounds like it's headed that way and may even have reached it, maybe it's time to use some of your money to hire a lawyer to send them a cease and desist letter."
You dated someone for eight years and you're legitimately considering dating her sister?! Wtf dude? That's so much of a bad idea.
"I'm going to second therapy. You sound extremely upset.

On a lighter note though, your perfect boyfriend really can't be perfect if you're ugly - because surely he then has the worst taste in partners? Jokes aside though, logically your assessment just doesn't work. "
"Jesus, why in the world did you get married so fast?!"
"Thanks. She passed my questions to see if she's competent. I'm pretty open about my early life when someone asks and her style worked for me.

It was just the third session that I started getting reluctant, and I just now figured out why. Another case of enough similarities to the norm for me to start making some parallels, but enough differences for me to be afraid of being judged for making those parallels. And when I say ""just now"" I mean it literarily. As in ""I interrupted my plan to write that I don't think I'll be as reluctant about any other part of my back story to get it down in text""."
"There's a pretty simple solution here: only buy something they suggest on the list.

You're basically insisting on creating problems because you're doing the very thing that you KNOW creates them. They don't like it when you try to get original with your gifts? Stop getting original with your gifts. It's not worth the trouble, your thought is not appreciated and it's honestly kind of haughty that you think your judgment is so superior to theirs that you're going to *continually* ignore direct requests and do what you want instead.

And is £15 really that expensive?"
"Well then you should know that ""intentional community"" doesn't mean ""substitute family"" or ""no boundaries"" "
"I get it. My cat stopped eating, and started puking lots at the beginning of the year for absolutely no reason. And unlike dogs, they don't start eating again after a hunger strike. My partner and I spent $1000 to learn it was absolutely nothing. We had to syringe feed her for two weeks to get her system going again, and now she is perfectly fine. 

I think if we weren't both so exhausted through the whole thing, and just relieved that she survived, we would have been real mad at the amount of money we had to spend to get that stupid thing to eat some god damn food. But we did X-rays and we did blood panels. Because animals can't say what's wrong. if it was a blockage, syringe feeding would have been ineffective. If it was diabetes, it could have killed her. We had to spend the money to know those things before we could decide what to do. 

So I think its fine to be annoyed at the cost. But I don't think you should be annoyed at your girlfriend for pursuing it. "
Ten bucks says sister already did... and is desperate enough to go this extra step.

"If she has a coworker willing to adopt the puppy, your guys' job is done. If she's really close with the coworker, maybe she could visit the dog or dog sit whenever the coworker needs your GF to do so.

"Yep. When you start doing it, generally 1 of 2 things happen. If the others are fat then you're taking away their excuses that it's too hard, etc so they want you to fail. If they're not fat, you're taking away their fat friend and becoming competition. It's unfortunate."

"yupppp

I know people who are super into being ""allies"" (not wanting a Catholic wedding because same sex couples can't get married in the Catholic church) who will turn around and say that you should never date bisexuals because they're faking/can't be monogamous/confused etc. And of course there are biphobic lesbians and gay people too. Which is why the mental health statistics for bi people are so terrible. It's really hard to know when someone is ""safe"" to come out to. "
"So do you directly say that they're wrong, then, or do you phrase it as a ""I think with more context, as provided in these sources, your understanding will be deeper"" sort of thing?  "
"Counseling is your best bet. It's nearly impossible to determine what the underlying problem is based on that description alone. However, it seems very obvious that something is stirring up inside your head. It would be good to get a counselor that could just pick your brain for a while until you can maybe come around and see what the source issue is. 

You're at least aware of this issue, and that's good! Most people wouldn't even bother to say two words about it. You're off to a great start. I didn't realize how many things from the distant past were affecting my current life until a counselor sorted through some of my thoughts. 

Maybe tell your boyfriend about this issue, and ask that he support you through counseling. Are you a student anywhere? Counseling tends to be free there. Also, if you have any form of health insurance, you can usually call the insurance provider and find counselors that offer low rates with some coverage on a sliding scale.

Good Luck OP!"
"I would honestly feel better if that was the case. Everything would make so much more sense, but I honestly don't see that happening here. I had that happen a few times and none of the red flags were here this time. "
"Calling every two weeks IS maintaining a relationship, that is about normal for a grown child who is not overly close to her parents. I'd say your demanding behaviour is what is pushing her away! 

Also her SO should be the greatest man she knows! One SO should always be the most important over everyone else."
"She might not be able to kick him out on the streets but she can absolutely send him to live with a relative or to boarding school of sorts. There are plenty of legal ways for parents to wipe their hands of their children, especially older kids."
"These responses from people thinking like you are nonsensical and don't address what's at the heart of the issue: what OP did was incredibly selfish and she shows zero empathy throughout her post.  She posted so she could feel justified, and commenters like you are enabling her.

Really, I think anyone that defends OP realizes they might do the same thing given the situation.  And you don't like being told that it's fucked up and selfish.  It's fine if you think what OP did was ok!  But don't get mad when others point out that you're a selfish asshole, because you likely earned that moniker."
"What a ridiculous, twee perspective on attraction. We all have physical preferences, shaming someone for asking how to bring up his concerns in a respectful way doesn't make this fact untrue."
"I'm guessing she's afraid that you'll never be ready, so she's pushing now to find out if it's ever going to happen.

I understand your fears and agree that you should wait, but part of me does wonder if you realize that no one ever feels 100% ready, and I bet your wife is worried there will always be something more you want before you're willing to start trying. 

My suggestion:

Think hard about what it is *exactly* that you need to be ready, and make them realistic goals. For instance, a certain amount in savings, having gone on a certain trip, etc. You say you want to be in a better financial situation, but that's too vague. Spell out what will make you feel ready, so you can both work on those goals. 

Ps. Do some introspection and make sure you do actually want to have kids."
"&gt;She has said I don't have to change my life, she accepts that, but her family cannot know

So...she doesn't accept it?

My experience has been...never ever do this unless you mean it. It always backfires. Even if it were only 'paper'... what are you going to do when you meet her family? Are you going to learn how to pray properly etc?

If her family is this strict on it, it's not going to be for show. (and odds are they're going to find out anyway)

&gt;GF wants an engagement planned in two months, and if I cannot go through with that, then we should end it now.

This is a huge sign. Sooner or later you're going to do something and she's gonna dump you. Run.

Never mind you've only been together 9 months. This is going to end up a train wreck. Even without the religion thing i'd be telling you this is a no go. This is not the girl for you.

edit:

&gt;but also deeply believes in islam

Also, she might be framing it as family, but if she believes that deeply, considering the pressure, i strongly suspect she's hoping you'll ""fake it till you make it"""
"I can't wait for it. She even offered to personally help me switch my classes, but I told her I needed to think on it. 

I don't want to quit at all, but if it's best for me in the long run maybe it's worth it?"
I agree with most but I was wondering why the boyfriend should be consoled?
"My problem is that I can't afford the procedure right now because I spent all my savings on his bills/car, so I would not be able to pay for it right now by myself. 

Why would you suggest I pay for it myself in this specific instance?"
"Well, first of all, I think you should stop taking that other road home.  Trying not to be a spoiled rich kid doesn't mean you have to be ashamed of your family just because they have more money than some.

I think maybe some of these kids see you as an easy target, and that probably has a lot more to do with how you react to other people making fun of you than anything else.  

Just stick to your own friends and forget the haters.  "
"&gt;He told me he feels incredibly insecure that I'm going to run off with someone from work and the fact I'm willing to still see Marcus at work means I'm subconsciously interested in getting more attention from him. He was crying and begged me to quit. 

Wow. You've handled thing beautifully, brava! You can't keep being held emotionally hostage to your boyfriend's insecurities. He's failing to see the big picture here and to insult you by implying you want the attention is an incredibly immature and spiteful thing to do. "
"This situation is wrong twofold, but it sounds like you're 10% wrong and he's 90% wrong. You are not making baseless claims-- she has no respect for your relationship, and she has no boundaries. It seems like there's a hint of jealousy and insecurity on your end that are exacerbating the situation, but in reality, your boyfriend should be hearing you out, respecting your feelings, agreeing that she's crossing a line, and then choose to do something about it (together). Your post doesn't make it sound like that's happening. For whatever reason, he's protecting her, which isn't okay. He's not respecting you or your feelings, and he's prioritizing her... probably because he knows that you let him get away with it, since that's what's been going on for the entirety of your relationship. 


Sounds like you guys should see a mediator who can help you clearly communicate the problem here. If you're trying to talk to him about this yourself, then he's either not listening or doesn't care. The least you can do is make sure that you're both fully informed about the each others' feelings about the situation, and from there, either choose to improve what's going on, or part ways so that he can become her doormat without disrespecting an SO on the side. 


Really though OP... this doesn't bode well. I want a partner who will stand by my side and feel like a teammate. Your bf is choosing to stand by Andrea's side. That's unfavorable. I hope you don't feel like you deserve this, because you don't. "

"The damage is done at this point. If you go on the vacation they will claim you're spending the kids money. If you don't go on the vacation, EB will claim she put a stop to the abuse single-handedly and many of the other people will give her version of events even more consideration because you wouldn't have cancelled that trip if you didn't feel guilty. "
"Hes in the middle of a divorce, with a child involved. You knew this when you started dating. Even if you think you know what their relationship was like (you dont), the fact that you want his attention when he should be giving that attention to the child that is dealing with his life changing should be enough to realize you dont know what you are dealing with here. Hes not even divorced yet. And you want all his attention and time and are jealous of a kid. Think about that. This isnt about the situation being ""new"", its about the fact that the divorce is ongoing, that he shouldnt be introducing his child to someone who may not be a permanent person in his life so soon, or throwing a wrench into a hopefully peaceful yet complex divorce. You are being selfish, and I can only hope its because you dont understand the complexities of a divorce, or parenting in that situation. And I cant help but think its because of the age difference here. "
"First off, holy shit congratulations on going to college when you were 15 and getting an 80k job when you're 19!!! You're frikkin amazing, and it's ridiculous your family doesn't care because that's an outstanding achievement. Second, yes definitely move out and go low contact and build up your self esteem again. "
"I hate how quickly people advice others to go into therapy on this sub!

But girl, this time I 100% agree.

If he is that good of a person and that good looking etc. He wouldn't settle. And from the small stuff you said about yourself (you are supportive, pushed him to do what would make him happy and are helping him achieve that goal. You love him and care about him) that are positive it just seems weird that you think something like that is easy to get. If he found something like that in you, then he is a lucky man.

But, this is about you. Not even your relationship.

You have some terrible self esteem issues and really need therapy. Being more self confident and liking yourself (emotionally and physically) would not only help you but it will make your boyfriend more happy aswell and other people in your life to see you be, well, happier, comfortabler and everything that comes with that.


You need to find a therapist for this. You said you are financially well off so it shouldn't be a problem.

Try it once or twice see how it goes and tell your boyfriend about it. Not about all your issues just yet. Just tell him that you want to see a therapist for self improvement etc. 

I hope the best for you. "
"I think you need to consider speaking with a therapist, your problems are kinda beyond what random internet strangers can help you with."
"Yeah, I don't think he should do couple's counseling with her, because she is probably going to become abusive towards him. She is abusive towards the sister. OP's day will come. "
"Hey, I think your comment has its heart in the right place, but it's not true that OP ""needs"" to come out. If he's really in such a bad environment for
LGBT people he's free to choose to tell someone or not tell anyone as he sees fit to protect his own interests. 


That said, he does need to break up with his girlfriend. "
"Wow, seriously, fuck your parents' attitude. That's disgusting. If I were your GF I wouldn't want anything to do with them, like...ever. If I were you I'd let them know that one day, she'll remember how they wouldn't protect her or file a police report. She'll think of that while she's holding y'alls baby and deciding whether his grandparents get to see him or not. If I were her, I'd say no - they don't get to see this baby because they wouldn't protect me, why would they protect my kid?

Just some food for thought. They might want to think about it while they're burning bridges and acting like total jerks."
Hi. Your wife is a psychopath. Your sister needs to move out for her own safety. Driving around on two flattened tires could have killed her if she had skidded off of the road. I think you should sell this giant house you can't afford and divorce her YESTERDAY.

"Oh, that's what you mean by somewhat local lock down location. I assumed it was a colleague at a military base giving a note to another colleague."
"Are you fucking kidding me? YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO? 

Your brother has a good case to press charges for attempted murder. Do you realize that? Seriously. SERIOUSLY. Yes, it's that big of a deal. Attempted murder. He could have died, it wasn't a joke or an accident, and he didn't let go. Yes. Attempted murder. 

If your boyfriend gets a good lawyer he could probably plea down to aggravated assault, which is a felony by the way.  Didn't realize that? Now you know! To get a felony assault charge you have to use a lethal weapon or some other force to cause serious injury. Sentencing can be up to 3 years in jail.

This is crazy. You are UNDER-reacting. Break up with this violent asshole. 

This is probably the most bananas post I've read on here. Not because what your boyfriend did was indeed INSANE, but because you're like, ""omg what do I do??"" 

BREAK UP BLOCK DELETE 

EDIT

Op's response:

""But omg it was only this one time and I don't want to ruin his life, I feel sooo badddd...!"" 

UGHHHH so aggravating. This is how women get killed by their partners. ""But I love him so much and he is so awesome besides the fact that he assaulted someone and then said he deserved it!"""
"Thanks for the advice, i updated"
"That's what I felt from reading his post too. He seemed lazy. I'm more inclined to believe his wife because I was like this in high school when I cared more about playing games than spending time with my girlfriend. Except this was years ago. I grew up. OP clearly hasn't. He sounds like a bum that can't even spend time with his wife. Her reaction was also abusive. Their relationship is clearly not healthy for either side.

EDIT: /u/worldwithoutwars (OP) deleted his account. Huh. Guess he didn't want people pulling stuff up from his comment history that shows that he's pretty much a terrible partner."
I think he keeps expecting her to say Sticksy is missing and wondering why she hasn't said anything.  That's why he keeps asking if she is okay.  I think it's great that she hasn't said anything yet because now he is probably sweating balls wondering why not.
"You are unhappy now. The fact he is not currently cheating on you doesn't have to be good enough for you. You absolutely can expect, and want, more from your partner.

You're allowed to dump someone simply because you want too. You don't have to wait for them to cheat, or hit you, or do something else truly terrible before you are allowed to end the relationship."
"I mean, I stole a lipstick once when I was like 14? And I felt terrible and never did it again. I don't consider myself a thief. "
"I don't want to roast you OP - you seem quite capable of doing that yourself.

You made a very serious mistake, but it did seem to come without any premeditation.  We're human beings, and as such mammals.  We make mistakes from time to time.  You can feel like you've done a bad thing, but there's no need to be quite so melodramatic and self-pitying about it.

I think you should tell you girlfriend what happened, put it in context, and let her judge whether this is something you can work through together.  And in future, be a bit smarter and don't put yourself in that kind of position."
"Fuck apologizing, she's a thief and I would stick to my guns. No sense in accepting blame for something you didn't do."
"Nope, you say once ""I'll be here"" and then you leave them alone until they come to you."
"My siblings and are I educated, self supporting and well liked as well. It's despite our parents, not because of them. 

That being said, I'm not no contact, and have tried to talk to my parents about it. 

What did he say when he went no contact? I'm sure he said more than ""I have a lot of anger for how I was raised.""

In the meantime, cut off is extremely stressful. I'd suggest therapy to help dealing with the loss of your son, and to best set yourself up for productive conversations if he's willing to have them in the future."
"Would you be willing / would your long-term financial plans allow for charitable donations as a line item in the budget? This way you can compromise, your wife can find projects to donate to (which isn't by definition a bad thing) but you can hopefully help rein things in so that you aren't in the poor house, so to speak. 

You might also discuss using whatever influence your money has bought to help raise further funds - by planning larger fundraisers or something like that. Dunno. Just thinking of ways she can help contribute time instead of solely money since she seems to enjoy the emotional fulfillment that comes with donating. "
"I know, I just can't get it either. But then again, I've heard so many similarly insane decisions that I'm not *surprised* by it any more."
This guy has to be great looking.. has to be. 
"This is honestly the perfect response right here. 

OP in my work as a PO, I also met a lot of the victims of my probationers. Some were kind just like you, but those were actual family members. You have no relation to this person and yet you have so much compassion. 

To be fair to yourself in all this, do as suggested above. Send him a certified letter, give him a timeline.
Then press charges if he fails to comply.

I've seen many positives come from 25 year old ""could've beens"" who succumbed to addiction. 

Sometimes a state funded plan aka PROBATION is what helps get them to act:
Rehab
Restitution Payment Plan
work training or placement and/or go to school (funded)
Free medical insurance 
Subsidies for rent 
with the option to expunge his record at some point.

As strange as it sounds, some may find this to be charitable to him as well. 

I'm so sorry this happened to you OP. Please don't let it change your thoughts on finding the right helper for your pet. You might consider asking your local shelter or pet shop of any volunteers whom do this in their spare time as well. "
"I don't think you understand the hormonal shifts involved with having an abortion. Her body is still recovering and reregulating even after three months.  You're being very selfish.  If it's that much of a deal to you, break up.  Don't repeatedly hound her as she deals with the aftermath of an abortion seemingly on her own."
"No, that's not right. You can get a job if you want to, it is good life experience, but you are still a minor and your medical treatment is your parents' responsibility.

Next time your dad makes a 'joke,' respond to it seriously. ""Dad, if I waited it out, my gallbladder would have ruptured and I could have gotten sepsis and died. Is that what you would have preferred?"" Hopefully that shuts him up."

"As ""upper level management"", I imagine that being her superior and intentions of dating her are against company policy, no? 

If not, have you considered that your awkwardness around her may be making the whole interaction awkward? Or that she's looking at you in meetings because you're management? 

It's certainly also possible she reciprocates I suppose and if it's not breaking any rules, I guess there's nothing *legally* wrong about it...

But I would still advise against it..."
Fostering a dog is also an option :)
"The first thing to do, even if you don't want a divorce right now, is to have a consultation with a divorce attorney.  Next, secure your assets in accounts in your name only.

Tell his parents, your parents and, if his affair partner has an SO, tell them.  He should no longer work with the affair partner.  His family needs to know because he has set the company up for a sexual harassment lawsuit.

Look for evidence of further cheating.  Look through his phone, take screenshots and save them.  Collect as much evidence as possible.  Keep it in a safe place.

Go to survivinginfidelity.com.  They have forums and a healing library that may help you.  This is a very helpful community with good advice."
Well I guess it depends on the person. Some people like to paint their nails in their SO's fav colour or wear lingerie in their fav colour. My boyfriend told me he did not find my spacers a turn on and would actually find them a turn off. So I decided not to start the process of stretching. I guess people are different but my boyfriends attraction to me means a lot
"That part confused me too but i guess it's different in that she slept with his ex once and not a long drawn out affair, and the fact that she was also getting divorced and left behind and she wasn't his best friend who betrayed him. What she did was shitty but not as bad in comparison. It doesn't really matter though cuz this is probably fake. "

I wouldn't be mad at all. Maybe a little embarrassed at first but I don't think I would dump my boyfriend if he was only trying to help me in a medical emergency.
"What?  If a person had a history of sleeping with married men in the last few years, I sure as fuck ain't going to be friends with them just because they smiled and said hi to me. 

And it's not clear just when their relationship started.  There's a chance the ex wife hates her for a good reason, other than just ""she's the new wife"""
"No, just no. He is her CHILD, not her therapist, and she treats him like shit. No. Do not listen to the above op."
He can buy takeout if he wants food without cooking. I wouldn't give in - it just shows him that you can be taken advantage of.
"To be fair to her... of course she isn't sure what she will want in five years. Her husband radically changed himself very shortly after marriage. She has no idea, now, who you will be going forward. 


I completely understand and support you saying you can't base your life on maybe. But I also completely understand and support her not wanting to take major risks - moving away from her support, having children - with someone who has done a 180 in some pretty fundamental beliefs. 


Asking her to be sure what she's going to want in the future is a pretty tall order at this point. "

You should think hard about who you give letters of recommendation for in order to avoid this scenario. It is your fault for giving a letter of recommendation to someone you knew had an immature social side. You should not rescind the letter of recommendation but be more circumspect next time one is requested and turn down the request if you would not stand up for that person in the future.

I'm sorry to say, it likely won't get better. I mean, it's a possibility, but if you go into a relationship having self image issues it's even harder to get rid of them in a situation like yours.

 I don't want to just tell you to end it, but personally, I was much happier when I was out of a relationship and was able to work on my self image issues without having to worry about my boyfriend's hot lady friends. I even ended up getting back with the guy (after a couple of years) and our relationship is much better now that I'm confident in myself! :)"
Thank you. What if she says she wants to give me everything and that she was just being too nice to him?

"Yeah, if it were a one-time thing, I could see it being a terrible mistake, but this went on and on and the kicker to me is the sexting with her right next to his wife. If he'd gotten that careless, I bet he's been doing shit like that for even longer than she realizes. Sad. "
"And you can say, ""even if it was just for kicks, I don't want to be with a man who browses escort for kicks. I don't think that's how someone with integrity behaves, I don't respect him anymore, and I will be filing for divorce""

You can divorce a man for ANY REASON. His parents don't have to approve. "

"My wife's grandmother died many years ago, before we were engaged. The executor of the will, and sole recipient of everything, an aunt no less, decided to put everything up for an estate sale. The aunt didn't have a sentimental attachment to anything, and simply wanted the money before flying back to her home halfway across the country. My wife had very fond memories of her grandmother, and as a child doing their makeup together at a vanity. She also loved a china hutch that was her grandmother's. The aunt had no idea how much these things meant to my wife after her grandmother's death.

Sound familiar?

Here's where things went differently than your situation. The aunt let the family know that things were going to be sold on a certain date and time. I sent my wife to the sale with a wad of cash, and said to do what needs to be done. She got to the sale before it started, and talked to her aunt about the sentimental value of the two items. The aunt saw what it meant to my wife, and while she did not give them away for free, she charged my wife less than the asking price.

My wife got to relive the good moments with her grandma for years, because every time she opened the drawers, she smelled her grandmother's perfume. I have no doubt that the vanity will be passed on to our daughter at some point, and the stories along with it.


Just because something isn't sentimental to you, that doesn't make it worthless to someone else. Assessed value can pale in comparison to the memories that something can bring someone. While my wife would have the memories regardless, the daily happiness she received from simply opening a drawer and looking in a mirror that also used to have her grandma's smiling face was worth more than what some random person off the street would have received from the same piece of furniture.

You're in relationships, not legaladvice. Legaladvice would tell you that you did nothing wrong, and that's true. With regards to relationships, you messed up by not letting family know that you were going to sell the items."
"He's fine when you initiate because that fulfills his fetish too. He wants you to want him, he has no desire to show you that he wants you until you've expressed your attraction to him. That is not healthy.  This is never going to get better until you put your foot down."
"So the fact that you don't readily orgasm during intercourse is all about him? 
"
Why should the OP have to announce a deeply personal and traumatic part of her life in the vain hope that her cousin will be shamed into acting like a decent human being? 
But that's only you. Some people have extremely low pain tolerances and an injury like this could put them into hysteria.
"That is actually a decent agreement. 

I won't lead her on. I won't make it ""easy"" to break up with her current boyfriend. I don't want it to be a ""Oh, there's no trouble breaking up with him because I have something a bit better waiting for me anyways!"" so I am just going to tell her I have no clue what will happen if she becomes single and see where she goes from there."
"You say your past relationship wasn't abusive, but what you describe is actually abuse. I think it is important for you to realize that. And I don't think you need to feel guilty about the cheating. Sometimes meeting someone else can make clear how much is wrong with your current relationship. It isn't ideal, but coping with abuse and getting the gumption to leave never is. 

As for your current relationship, personally I wouldn't mention it unless there's a decent chance someone else who knows will mention it, and I wouldn't directly lie. "
I mean get her off before you even attempt penetration... 
"Tell her no. Just seriously dont do it. Shes trying to line up another relationship before she leaves the one shes in. That's exactly the same thing she did with you. Even if you have changed, she hasn't and a relationship with her will only set you back. "
"&gt;""Stop promising because you're just upsetting my little brother.""

This is one of the most heartbreaking things for a small child to have to say to their father. An eight year old feels the need to protect her brother from his own father because he's so incapable of considering the emotional needs of others. 



Your husband is a worthless piece of shit. Bring this up in counseling if you want to, but I really don't know what to say that will make someone stop causing such emotional pain to their own children. "
"&gt; first thing you need to realize is that you should never ever compare yourself to anyone else

"&gt;She rolled her eyes when I began walking faster and accused me of loving that attention and just acting as being sad and disgusted to receive even more attention.

This person is AWFUL. Street harassment is incredibly violating and awful, and has nothing to do with the attractiveness of the person being harassed, nor with what she is wearing. Women get catcalled wearing everything from bikinis to burkas, because men who catcall are disgusting, aggressive idiots who get off on making women feel uncomfortable and afraid.

In the moment: ""What a strange accusation, of course I don't enjoy having strangers force their vulgar minds into my pleasant walk."" If she pushes: ""Let's change the subject. I can see we aren't going to agree."" Look up ""grey rock technique."" Basically stop arguing with her and default to changing the subject. She's awful, nothing she says is true, she clearly has a cargo ship full of baggage about this issue, so don't waste your energy fighting with her about it.

Also: there is NO UNIVERSE in which it is appropriate for a work superior to say things like this to someone under her. She insulted you (by saying you aren't classy), blamed you for sexual harassment, and even said you *invited* sexual harassment?! I mean, that is wildly, wildly inappropriate for a work conversation, especially if you fear retaliation if you tell someone about what she said to you. It might be worth writing up an account of this with dates and places, and even talking to higher-ups or HR in a very general way (like, ""What would be the procedure if a superior had an unwanted sexual conversation with a junior employee?""). Of course, you are the only one who can decide if that's something you want to do.

Good luck!"
"Can confirm. I went from a flat chest to a full C. Not even 300cc's. They're the tits. They're not overdone at all and honestly nobody can tell they're fake. I had an awesome doctor who refuses to put HUGE implants on small framed women. He believes in proportion. My back hurt a little after the surgery readjusting to the new ""weight"" in the front but I'm so much happier with my body now. "

"Well, he's 23 so that's only natural. He may get better at handling the whole ""adult relationship with parents"" thing as time goes on. It's a weird transition for everyone, parents included."
"That is more clear. Your post REALLY seems to be blaming him.

In that case, you really need to stop watching those horrible movies with overblown proposals.  They aren't real.  Out of all of my friends and myself included, only one of them had even a moderate 'big' proposal.  Guess who isn't still married."
"He's frustrated, he snaps, he lashes out, he represses.

Wow, it's easy to cherry pick.

They both have problems, but I can sympathize with why he's at the end of the rope. And yes, it is embarrassing to have a partner who can't sit through a meal politely and you constantly have to make excuses for them. He specifically asked her to put on her happy face because he's tired of having to excuse his partner's poor behaviour."
You are her security blanket. Her second choice. Her backup plan. Her guy that she cries to about the man that she loves. Is that what you want in a wife?
"I think if a mom posted here that she wanted to drop her child off at a safe haven, she just might get some down votes. Abdicating responsibility isn't all that popular whether you are a mom or a dad."
"I think you should communicate. If she ""freaks out"" just because you were honest and shared how you feel... Then this on wasn't for you. You need to be clear about what you want out of a relationship right now: being clear isn't going to scare away anyone who is *okay* with that. Not being clear would only serve to try to cling to someone who might be very upset in the future because you weren't clear and let things carry on. That's how people end up feeling angry and uses, man. Just be honest. You said you have, but this worry you're expressing says to me that you need reassurance that you're both on the same page: so go get it. "
"Until your husband tells his dad you guys upped the day.... your husband did spill the beans the first time so what's stopping him now?

This time you are probably going to have to bite the bullet and take it, or put your foot down and cause problem.

For the future, you and your husband need counseling. You are ignoring/fighting every piece of advice in this thread. No matter what happens, someone's not going to be happy, and you don't seem to realize that.

You and your husband need counseling so you can properly explain why boundaries with the FIL is so important. He needs it so he can grow a spine and realize he's an adult who doesn't need to constantly seek the approval he's never going to fully have."

"Honestly, that's reasonable on her part. She's not punishing you by denying you sex. She's making a responsible call based on a real risk of pregnancy. The risk may not seem significant *to you*, but it's a bigger risk than she's willing to take. 

I'm not asking you to change your mind about abortion, but I urge you to do more reading about the actual risks and physical effects of pregnancy. It's a huge deal. You can know that and still believe that abortion is wrong, but downplaying the degree to which pregnancy affects someone isn't going to help your case. "
Get a lawyer and explain everything.  They will be able to tell you what would be admissible as evidence.  This will depend heavily on your country and state.  A lawyer will also give you a better idea about how successful her false allegations will be.  Then make plans appropriately.

"You should have added that to your post. Way to try to spin a post making yourself look not as much of an ass.  She shouldn't be contacting you.  You should be contacting, apologizing and bringing an apology gift to her brother. Instead you're sitting at home, whining that she's not contacted you. This is on you to make amends"

"I really hoped this was a joke. Childbirth is possibly the most terrifying thing a human can go through, and you want your wife to do it alone?

And if you do expect to be coming home to a fucking divorce because curse the men who voluntarily miss the birth of their children. Your job won't last your life but your kid will.

"This isn't something you can fix, and it's going to get worse before it gets better. Nothing in your post has suggested he's even a little upset over what he's done. No details of apologies, no fears of what his behavior has done, no empathy for what he's put you through. He doesn't even stick to his own commitments not to drink.

You need to tell his family that he threatened to kill himself, and you need to cut off all contact. Your physical and emotional safety is at risk. "
"&gt;Right, because everyone is perfect and nobody ever, ever takes out their frustrations on someone else.

Look at it like this- do you take your frustrations out the same way on *anyone* who gets near you in one of those states, even people who have power over you, like a boss at work? Or do those frustrations just get taken out on people who can't get your fired?

I think that's the difference between 'abusive partner' and ""isn't great at compartmentalizing."" 

Make no mistake- not *everyone* gets 'attitude' with their partner after a bad day at work (for example). There's a distinct difference in being crabby with your partner because *someone else* upset you that day vs. complaining to your partner about what a crap day you had."
"My aunt and uncle are actually second cousins once removed from each other, and they have two healthy normal children with each other. There is absolutely no issue with it in our family, because the connection between them is so distant. The percentage of shared DNA that they have is really very very small, almost to the point that it's nothing. Here (Europe) it's not even seen as remotely close to incest, and I don't think it is in the USA either.

It's not exactly something they talk about, but that's more because it's not a big deal than the reverse.

However, if you have family members that are against your relationship, I don't think you'll be able to convince them very easily. You will have to make a decision if you can both live with the reactions or rejections you get from these family members, or you'll have to choose your relationship with each other over other relationships...

Your relationship has nothing wrong with it at all, and I hope that you can convince her of this. Good luck!"

Good for Megan for approaching OP right away and telling her about Eric. She came clean as soon as she realized something was wrong."
You should understand that for some people this is much more than a personal conviction. It is taking a life. It is something they feel has implications on the final disposition of their soul.

I have know way of knowing how you act around your group of friends because you haven't described any real interactions.  I bet your wife isn't talking about a Facebook poll.  She's thinking of specific things you have said to people and their reactions to them.  Maybe you can start by asking what she sees you doing if you value her opinion.

"I had the worst Thanksgiving. My dogs got in a huge fight (again) just a couple days before my dad is adopting one. We have to see the vet today. 

I also had a hawk land on my head at work yesterday. Ouch. (I do free flight training with raptors at a zoo facility). 

My dad failed to plan for Thanksgiving dinner. So we were stuck with frozen lasagna...

But my sweet boyfriend saved me a plate of food from his Thanksgiving dinner. And he cuddled me and comforted me. And he's cooking me a real Thanksgiving dinner on Sunday. So I get to come home from work to fresh cooked food! He's wonderful. And even will watch my favorite Christmas movies with me, despite being (as he calls himself) ""a crotchety old Jew"". But I don't think he's old or crotchety. Just sweet and lovable."
"&gt;Mike hadn't see the need to define our new relationship terms as ""broken up"" because we have been in constant communication and mutually want to work things out.

Translation: He wants you around for conversation, sex, and all the good parts of a relationship, but without the commitment.  He has made it abundantly clear that he considers himself single, and therefore he is free to do whatever he wants with whoever he wants.  Why else would he say you two were broken up when you weren't around ?

I'm sorry, I know this is hard to hear.  I wish he wasn't such a coward and could just break things off and not leave you hanging by a string, but that's apparently the way he is.  He considers himself single, and is using you.  You deserve better.  Break it off and tell him not to come in 2 weeks.  Rip off the bandaid and don't worry about ""closure"".  You deserve someone that loves you and is committed to you.  Don't settle for anything less, ok ?"

Back to the matter at hand, as others have said, phone the clinic and get the appointment changed. It's scary the your SIL did this. She is as controlling as your husband. She didn't do this to give you more time. She did it to control the situation. SHE IS NOT YOUR FRIEND. Do not fool yourself. She is loyal to her brother only and used gaslighting to make you think otherwise. 

The other issue is your marriage. It is not healthy. He is not going to get better. He will only try to control you more. This behaviour has so many red flags it is SCARY.  PLEASE, please, please contact a lawyer. You are not in a safe, loving relationship. "
You can't really help her if she doesn't want to be helped.
"&gt;She's on Uni holidays right now

So she technically lives at home, and she's visiting you.  You can't make her pay rent when she doesn't actually live with you.  And since she'll be going back to school, you are making a problem out of nothing as this is only temporary.

While she is at your house she should atleast clean up her mess, but not necessarily clean up after you."
"&gt; That's the only way for me to explain it.

Only since you seem to lack the ability for introspection and deciphering your feelings if the thing that bothers you isn't blatantly obvious. You say in other responses that some of the people are obnoxious and hard to deal with, his grandmother is always on your case about having babies and eating because you're too skinny, and tried to break you up years ago. Those are totally legit and understandable reasons to not want to be around someone. 

Best of luck. "

When I think about giving up my horse, and everything I've worked hard for to stay in the sport-- it honestly makes my heart ache and tears come to my eyes.  

I told these guys to pound sand and I don't regret my decision at all.  Hobbies that you love stay with you forever and allow you enjoyment, personal growth, and solace when you need it...if someone can't respect that, then they should find someone else."
