"posts like this are stupid and usually devolve into wankfests for people to air grievances about trust-fund kids and pat themselves on the back for not being a trust fund kid, or not living in a trendy neighborhood like those foolish hipsters, or being better at budgeting, etc.

you know damn well how people afford to live in trendy neighborhoods:

1) first of all three roommates sharing an apartment together absolutely makes it more affordable

2) some of them probably aren't luxury pads; many are cramped old walk ups with horrible landlords/management

3) some of them are probably rent-poor and live paycheck to paycheck

4) some of them have parents who paid for college and they have no debt

5) some of them probably have parents who just help subsidize the rent

i never get these kinds of questions - like, how does anyone pay for anything other than the above?  you either split the thing with people, or the thing is actually shitty/low-quality, or you're actually going broke paying for it, or you're getting help to pay for it.  or some combination of those things.  is that not obvious to you?  this question reads like, ""people have nicer things than me; why and how does this happen?"""
I eat Dominos
"Staring up at the buildings. 

I just like architecture, the scale, the negative shapes of sky...

In my defense, I don't suddenly stop slack-jawed in the middle of the sidewalk to do my staring."
I like to stand by the door of the subway car.
"I don't give up my seat for young children.  


Fuck you, I'm old and I want to sit.  You're six, you have energy. "
Living in NJ.
I order Domino's a few times a year. Not because I want pizza. Because I want Domino's. 
I like Times Square. I'll even walk through for kicks. 
"Also there are actually young people who make money in finance, consulting, law, tech, etc."
too soon
"Guy, you're the reason they still do it!"
I day drink on fridays and take the subway home drunk during rush hour.
"I love comedian Todd Barry's bit about Californians' superiority complex when it comes to Mexican food:

â€œNew York has 10,000 amazing chefs and, believe it or not, a handful of them have figured out how to replicate the quesadilla... You know what else we have in New York? Mexican people. And we let them cook in restaurants."""
Buy a god damn AC it's not like you're shopping for the Hope Diamond   
Honestly much better than walking smokers. It sucks waking behind them and breathing their cigarette. 
Booooo hissssss efficiency is manners in this city!
"Found this on Spotify. Could this be them? The sound and time period seem to match up. Sorry if I'm being totally unhelpful.

"I... I... used to be that guy standing at the subway door asking people for swipes

I am so sorry everyone. "
"Personally, I like Absolute Bagels on 107th/Bway"
He's asking for UN acceptable behavior.
I don't give up my seat for anyone but pregnant women or the obviously disabled. I work crazy long hours at a physical job. Like you don't know my life. That 30 minute nap I get is sometimes the best part of my day. 
"A lot of times, I wait for a walk signal."
"If I'm impressed, I give money to show time boys. I'm sorry"
Get the fuck out. 
Whos name is on the bill? 
Pay the bill and sue your former roommate in small claims. 
When I arrived in NYC I was about 8 pounds and have only gone up since then. :(
"I'm 6'5"" and 300lbs. People think I'm man spreading when I'm just sitting there."
"Even fucking worse... two people give up their seats for a parent and their kid. 

The kid stands on the seat with their nasty fucking shoes while the parent surfs facebook. "
"This is the most unacceptable thing here.

...also what's up with so many half-assed one-man hat-centric showtimes suddenly popping up?!"
I'll go first.  Sometimes I walk slowly :/
"I'm pretty sure that is completely acceptable. Enjoyable, on the other hand..."
"Most of these recommendations are ""Brooklynized"" white-people Mexican food. For the real stuff, I recommend these spots:

Tacos el Bronco in Sunset Park

Los Hermanos in Bushwick

Tacos el Rancho in Sunset Park

Taco Mix in Harlem

Tacos Matamoros in Sunset Park

I feel like I should mention this in this thread, I grew up in LA."
"Good on you for not having the word ""pizza"" anywhere in your post."
"I think NYC is one of those places where you can get away with pretty much any style of backpack without looking like a 7th grader.
I'm a fan of fjallraven backpacks."
That sounds like an illegal room.
"I really fucking hate it when I give a seat to a parent with their kid and instead of sitting and putting the kid in their lap, they let the kid sit and they stand. Small enough to ride for free, small enough to sit on a knee."
I like you.
"Shit with lines. I'm talking Broadway lotteries and rush tickets, Shakespeare in the Park, Summerstage free shows, standby lines for studio audiences. All these things that with work I just don't have the time to even try to do. 

Also, check the NY Parks page - they have all kinds of cool shit over the summer. They've got free movies and concerts and kayaking and meditation and yoga and shit."
"This is unforgivable to me.  I always stand by the doors (because I like to lean against the door), and if it's even *slightly* crowded, my standard procedure is to get off the train and then get on last (so that I can easily get that door spot back).

But yeah, this is so unforgivable to me, because with the size of the subway doors, there seems to be *exactly enough* room to get two lines of people exiting and entering the subway at once, but if someone stands in the doorways (even sideways), now there can only be *one row* of people exiting and entering at once, and it really slows things down.

PLEASE don't do this!"
