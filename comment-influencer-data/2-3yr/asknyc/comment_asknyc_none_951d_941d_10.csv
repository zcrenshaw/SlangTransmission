More affordable housing. 
"The city actually doesn't sleep, because landmass and buildings don't require rest. The cities inhabitants do though. "
A better system of removing garbage so that it's not all over the streets and sidewalks.
"It's both way more expensive than I imagined, while also having tons of great free and cheap things to do I'd have never thought of. "
"* A working subway that is actually improving and expanding.

* Affordable housing and more protection for renters of all sorts - not just  those in public and semi-public housing

* More parks and green-space in more regions, not just like 2 or 3 huge parks that are far away.

* Actual public cleaning, as in people, not over priced shitty machines that don't do a god damn thing other than make people move their cars.

* A massively expanded bike lane network.

* Working internet.

* Working government without invested self interest and conflicts of interest at the heart of most public positions.

* Legal weed."

"That I thought it was going to be easy. That I thought it was like the movies and you can just move from your podunk town in the deep south and make things happen and that everything would fall in place like magic. 

In reality, this city will rip you to goddamn shreds and spit on the remains. People are so incredibly nice but it's also every man for himself -- very dog-eat-dog. But I also think that's a lesson that I had to learn for myself, that a lot of people have to learn for themselves. I've hit bottom so many times in the last six months, but I view everyday as an experience (which is 100% a necessity unless you want to be horribly depressed; I, and my poor therapist, would know) and if it is meant to be, everything will eventually work out but it is going to take a lot more effort on my part than I thought. 

My therapist had an excellent, if questionable, expression to describe it: ""Being in New York is like being in an abusive relationship with the coolest guy in the world."""
In and out burger so the damn californians can shut up.
"Call the BRC at 212.533.5151. They're an excellent program for homeless people and can help you find a safe place to stay and connect you with resources to get on your feet.

Your number one priority is finding a safe place to sleep."
Our drinking water.
The apartments look bigger on TV.
The exile of Trump in every way shape and form 
"Go less on percentage if you aren't buying a lot, I do more of an automatic $5-10 base tip/'snow delivery fee' and then percentage on top of that.

It's shitty outside and it's just getting worse. If they are working today they probably need the money."
"No.

The hate is valid."
The full 2nd avenue line. From Hanover Sq to Harlem

"Four years ago I was having dinner with my roommates in Bushwick when a couple friends unexpectedly show up dressed like Mad Max extras, and tell us there is a Thunderdome in the abandoned 19th century church-turned-art space around the corner.

There was, and we spent the night perched on top of the dome, drinking whiskey out of beer cans, watching elaborately costumed hipsters suspended on bungee cords beat each other with nerf bats.

The best match was between a 12 year old girl and a little old man I assume was her grandpa. Both had excellent costumes and really got into it. They were so small they could practically fly on the bungee cords.

"There are three bridges between Staten Island and New Jersey, the Goethals Bridge, the Bayonne Bridge, and the Outerbridge Crossing. The Outerbridge Crossing is named after a guy whose last name is Outerbridge. "
I honestly thought I would have to get used to being mugged regularly.
"Randomly running into people I haven't seen in years, for me. A guy I know, Danilo, just walked out of the subway while my wife and I were sitting on a park bench. Hadn't seen him in years up until then.

A former coworker who had moved back to Estonia, ended up hanging out right outside my new office."

"I would say the best thing to do would be to get out of NYC.    

Its expensive here and very difficult to get started, especially based on your circumstances.    

If you went somewhere with a cheaper cost of living you could probably afford to live on minimum wage or a little higher. Very tough to do that here, and if you do it won't be as comfortable as somewhere else.    

I used to rent a 2 bedroom apartment with detached garage (about 8 years ago) in Binghamton for $460 / month.    "

"This kinda makes me feel like you're writing an article for Buzzfeed or Gothamist, especially with those smarm-tastic opening sentences. 

Is there something specific you're looking for? If you're just looking for a generic list of free or cheap stuff, there are a ton of resources in our sidebar and a shitton in a simple Google search. "
"Cleaning out my 14-year-old storage space (finally), I came across a whole bunch of hockey jerseys from when I used to play a decade ago. I kept a couple from my school teams, and the others – casual adult-rec teams I used to play on at SkyRink – I threw into a box that I dropped off at Goodwill.

About two months later, I'm heading down to the subway with a friend after lunch at Union Square. She needs the 4/5 and I need the L, but since I'm not in a rush and we're still talking I walk down to the 4/5/6 platform with her. Her train arrives, she gets on, and I turn to walk back up the steps when I see a guy standing on the platform, wearing a hockey jersey with a familiar green logo that I just can't place. ""The Hurricanes? But that can't be the NHL team, their logo is red and black..."" He turns around to talk to his friend and there on the back is my old number, and my *last name*.

I went up to him and said, ""You're not going to believe this, but that just happens to be my old hockey jersey you're wearing."" I even took out my ID to show him (and my last name is fairly unique) because it was so unbelievable that it was mind-blowing for all of us. 

In a city of 8 million people, this one guy buys my old jersey at Goodwill and happens to be waiting for a train at the exact same time that I entered the station, and if I hadn't been talking to my friend I wouldn't have even been on that platform at all but would have gone straight to the L. It's one of the most amazing coincidences that's ever happened to me."
"So many...

The city is encouraging drivers to stay off the road. You should help the city do this by taking public transit today. 
An old black guy roller skating on 8th Ave when I go to work. He has a speaker and a microphone and the only purpose of entire endeavor seems to cheer people up and complement their coats and whatnot.
"The Bowery was the fenceline of my ancestor's farm in the late 1600's. He decided Manhattan was going to get too crowded for farming, so he sold that farm and founded the first town in Brooklyn.

My ancestor was a goddamn hipster. "

You're imagining things.
Better access to hiking/outdoors stuff.
"2010 or so, walking to L train on 1st Ave from alphabet city. Probably 2am, there's 3 of us in front and 2-3 in back. We walk by some random person.c don't think anything of it, then a few seconds later my buddy comes running up to us in front and is like ""oh my god I hate this city soooo much."" We're like what just happened and he's like there's this girl squatting between two cars and taking a piss, she looks up at my buddy and says ""what you've never seen a fuckin pussy before"" in the most stereotypical Long Island accent ever."
