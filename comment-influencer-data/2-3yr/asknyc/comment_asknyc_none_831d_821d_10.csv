"There is no scene, the days of people huddling together are gone. The world has changed, we have the internet. People live wherever.

I sigh because a 21 year old ""artist"" who blames her ""relaxed"" location for them not being able to motivate herself to create art is not an artist. The problem is you, not LA.

(gender edit)"
"Go to pants store, buy pants, go into bathroom, wash your ass, put on new pants, go to bar and get drunk, then go back to bay ridge"
"Don't confuse nostalgia with reality. You want to live in a historical past, and you will pay dearly for that. Who are the artists you follow now in NYC and where are they at? You should really be able to answer your own question before you get gobbled up, right? If you don't know this answer--who and where are the artists in your cadre--then it's only uphill. "
"Change it by creating art, not blaming your surroundings on your failure. You live in an age where you can get  your art in front of billions of people for basically free. You don't need to squander your parents money for a fancy address."
"&gt; What do you mean?

He means that you're most likely going to end up broke (like, literally homeless) and unhappy."
I get drunk in my bathroom every night after my wife goes to sleep; so you're welcome to try that out.
"&gt; WHERE IS THE ART SCENE, THEN? Brooklyn?

Detroit. Maybe other cheap places in the Midwest. Yes, I'm being serious. There's some art communities left in Bushwick, ridgewood and maybe red hook but even those are shrinking and getting priced out.


I've no idea why you think moving to NYC is necessary to make it as an artist. You're about 30 years too late."
"&gt;I want to live in the East Village/LES area simply because of its history in the art scene.

That scene does not exist.

&gt;The problem is that LA is so relaxed and laid back that I can't motivate myself to work on my art and take it seriously. 

...***sigh***"
"Upcoming artists do not move to NYC. It's gone way past the point where it's affordable for people on low incomes and the art scene you wistfully romanticize about has long since up and gone.

The LES and east village are expensive playgrounds for rich people. You can't afford to live there. There is absolutely NO ART SCENE THERE ANYMORE. 

You mentioned film coloring and painting and graphic design. As some career advice from someone in media production, for fuck's sake pick something you like and you're half decent at and focus on it as a career goal or you're just going to be one of those guys who sucks at everything. And there's a lot of them.

Do not move to NYC with this as a career plan. You'll go home broke, bitter and very, very disappointed "
"&gt; And LA is so spread out and relaxed that I just kind of settle. I'm too comfortable where I am now and it pisses me off because I know I could be doing better things

The problem isn't LA. The problem is you. You're not motivated enough and moving to a much more expensive city isn't going to change that."
"First off, you're a damn fool.

That said, if you are gonna do this anyway, you need to approach it totally differently. The idea that you're going to live in some fucking ""artist"" neighborhood is an idealized moronic idea. You're not going to. You want to live in the cheapest place you can that will allow you access to the arts, not in the expensive, cool, hip, artistic neighborhoods of your objectively vapid wet dreams.

First, you have to figure out how much money you can make every month. Living on 2k/month here is doable, but it's nightmare and you will not have fun. Everything will be stress about money. You won't be able to afford to go to any of the ""artist"" events. Happy hours, art shows, art cinema - all of these things will be out of your price range. You will be able to find out about these amazing, cool events and you will be unable to attend them and you will be unable to network with the people you want to meet. So you have to figure out a real job that you can get that will let you live comfortably enough that you can go to these things and meet these people. Doing that without a completed degree is very difficult.

But then, you can't. You can't legally work here in a standard job because you're on a student visa. So how the fuck are you planning on paying for anything? Are you earning income from freelance gigs right now? Depending on what kind of student visa you're here on, you might be violating your visa to do that. It's definitely a visa violation if you're doing it on an F2 visa.

So you're not motivated, your ability to earn money likely requires you to commit fraud against the US government, but we're the assholes because you're a law-breaking, naive moron whose self-label of ""artist"" is probably about as meritorious as Jeremy Pivens' ego."
If one of the requests is that you must be vegan I promise you if you move in the crazy requests and demands on you will only increase. 
Ok nevermind pretty normal
"No, you are not an artist by default. You are a hobbyist. Learn the difference, kid."
"&gt; I moved from Brazil to LA for college

This would have been a good way to learn the ropes of the 'art scene' in NYC as a newbie - via going to school here, getting an internship, etc., etc.

I used to have artist friends and through them knew a little about the art world here, but they have long since moved away and now I don't know. All I can say is most of the gallery districts that used to move from one neighborhood to another (Soho/East Village/Chelsea) seem to be...either gone or I don't know where they are anymore.

You may do your art on a computer, but traditionally - artists need a lot of space and those neighborhoods with affordable space are no longer affordable. If you're an aspiring sculptor or painter it really doesn't make sense to live in NYC unless you can get by doing something else.

I am sure there are niches of artists in the greater NYC area but I'm not sure where they are other than to guess they are in the poorest more dangerous neighborhoods.

One thing you may not get though is just how much NYC has been gobbled up by real estate developers and absentee landlords.  It just not is the same place it was 20 years ago."
Hey guys! We got another one. Someone else wanna tell him? I'm drunk and can't type too fast
"Your community here will not be with artists, since you aren't one. Best case, you will hang out with kids who tried to get some art degree while you both work at Starbucks. Difference is they probably get money from mom and dad so they at least can accomplish a few things in their spare time."
Moving to NYC is straight up a fucking terrible idea if you self describe as not motivated. No one here is going to push you to get better. They will push you to get out of the way so they can get ahead. This is not California. We don't do the communal love fest support shit. This city will eat you alive. 
"Your post verges on parody.

If you're trolling, then well done. You've got the perfect mix of ""ludicrous, but just credible enough to maybe be true.""

If you're serious, then you need to look at moving to NYC as a goal, not a starting point. Yes, of course living on the LES would be great. So would living in a golden space palace on Mars. But the fact that it'd be cool doesn't make either of those things realistic options at this point in your life.

As to Astoria or other areas, that all depends on what you do and whether you can get a job lined up. What exactly is it that you do to pay the bills, currently? What's your budget?"
"Walk fast, and whatever you do, do not stop in the middle of the sidewalk and turn around abruptly."
"What will moving to NY change about you? No one here will ""push"" you to be better. They will see that you're a kid from LA who couldn't get his shit together to actually create anything and disregard you. Artists have no desire to hang out with people like you. You are draining, you are trying to leech off of them. It would be different if you were actually doing something in LA, but you already admit you're too lazy to do anything so I don't know what you expect to change about **you**.

Get your shit together first."
"You're not being attacked, you're being ridiculed. That's an important distinction. The ridicule actually comes from a somewhat well-intentioned place. Besides being fun, mockery is a good way of impressing upon somebody how bad their idea is, and how much trouble it could put them in. If a bunch of people who live in NYC think that your idea is worthy of scorn, then that should at least make you stop and think for a couple of minutes. 

&gt;  I can share a bedroom with 5 people for all I care. I'm done with comfort, it's not taking me anywhere.

That's good, because that's close to the environment you will be living in for that budget, and then you can use that environment to ""dictate how you feel"" about doing art. Good luck. You'll definitely need it. "
"&gt;  I just get the feeling that in LA everyone is trying to get to the top by climbing on others, and in NYC they help each other up. 

This is fucking hilarious. "
"Contrary to what many New Yorkers think, the state is in full control of New York City Transit (thankfully, the media and Rider's Alliance is doing a lot to educate the public on this these days).  Your best bet would be to contact your state senator, state assemblyperson, and the Governor's Office in a variety of different mediums: telephone, on their Facebook pages, on Twitter, by mail, and by email.  If your local state representatives have town halls or regular public meetings, go to them and bring this up.  Write letters to the editor about the issue as well.

On a mass level, you could help organize protest and rallies outside your state representatives' offices in favor of infrastructure improvements to the subway system."

"Okay. Let's do this.  
    
Step 1 - Find a store that sells pants. I'm not fussy, I just need pants so any shop will do. In fact, probably a shop I would normally not go to for pants would be my friend today so I never need to go back there. Get a new pair of socks too.  
    
Step 2 - stroll in to a hotel lobby like I own the place and head straight for the bathroom.  
    
Step 3 - take shoes off, but leave socks on. Remove shitpants. Use 'clean' parts of the pants to clean myself up.  If I make a mess on the floor, it's not the end of the world - I am still wearing socks. Once I am as clean as I can get, remove shitsocks.  
    
Step 4 - Put shitpants and shitsocks in the bag that I got with the new pants. Wash myself thoroughly. Put on new pants and new socks.  
    
Step 5 - Make a decision about my shit clothes - can they be salvaged or are they done? Throw or keep according to decision.  
    
Step 6 - Cancel whatever plans I had for the rest of that day, unless I can get to a shower before getting there. Spend the rest of the day looking for rentals in Manhattan."
"I think you might be hitting the NYC 4-year therapy mark. Transplants (like myself) can sometimes need a conversation to make sure you're properly managing the stress of living in this crazy place. I've been here for almost 9 years for context. 

Regarding your actual question, I am more aware of my surroundings in densely populated places (concerts, arenas, clubs) and I look for exits and make plans that I probably wouldn't have 10 years ago. 

[The world is the safest it's ever been](https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-10-23/world-actually-safer-ever-and-heres-data-prove), even with the recent attacks. The media and infatuation with tragic news make it seem like that's all that's happening. We shouldn't ignore these horrific events as compassionate human beings, but the odds of you being affected personally by a terrorist attack are MUCH lower than your risk of death as a consequence of nuclear war. 

does that help? "
"Call the governor's office and let them know that unless there's a massive change in subway service and unless he stops raiding MTA coffers, you're supporting literally anybody else in the Democratic primary. "
"100% depends on the type of crazy, but mostly I would get up at the next stop and switch cars. "
"Don't get on line until you're ready. In a deli, this means knowing what you're going to order. At the subway, this means step aside while you find your metro card. "
"op,  I suggest you take an economics course first.

Learn about supply and demand.

There are no 800 buck apartments in any of the areas you would want to live in.

NYC is overwhelmed with rich parentally or maritally supported artists.

There is neither a place not a system to support ant new coming starving artists.

If you are set up in LA, then remain there.

The NYC you envision died in 1993 or so.

Finish your degree, make connections, save up, have an income then re-evaluate. 

If you come here your time and energy will be used up simply surviving...no art...no social life...no future.
"
"&gt; $1,200 a month (800 + 200 + 70 + 130)

This will not be your budget. Can't help but notice you don't have a budget for, oh, I don't know....artist supplies?"
"911 for assault, not 311.  "
"The general thing with New Yorkers is we are always trying to get somewhere and if you slow us down, we get mad.  So just generally try to avoid slowing others down, most new york etiquette rules follow from this idea.  

So dont stop in the middle of the sidewalk to check your gps, move to the side.  Dont stand in a turnstile and look for your metrocard clogging that turnstile up.  The west coast is a different world as far as im concerned, so there will be some culture shock, but overall its not complicated if you are willing to pay attention to how you impact the people around you.  

Edit:  Trains, trains are a big one.  But let people off before you get on, plenty of people do not follow this rule and they are all dicks.  Dont lean on a pole on the crowded train if its obvious other people may need to hold it.  Nothing makes me happier than seeing an old lady do a loud EXCUSE ME to some suit wearing finance douche whos leaning on the pole and preventing others from holding it.  "
"It's not hate, it's fatigue. We get a lot of these types of questions here from outsiders with all kinds of romantic ideas about what life in NYC is like, most of whom are unprepared and unrealistic. Personally I don't see the point in telling anyone not to come because they'll do what they want and if they succeed, great and if they don't, whatever. Life will likely be hard, but you probably won't die so if you think it's worth it to you, just do it."
"If you go on a Wednesday at 10 pm nobody will care, if you go Sat at 11 am you ll be probably asked to gtfo"
"Just to be clear, because it sounds like you just spoke to a cop on the phone: go to the precinct it happened near and file a police report in person. They may not actively search for him, but they will keep him in mind as someone to lookout for on their patrols. Also, if he's done this to other people and they all report it, the cops will know it's the same person and escalate their tactics to find him as well as the charges against him. If you haven't already, bring it up at your community board meeting. The old folks there will want to know someone's targeting people small/weak people."
"My advice is breathe deep and ride the wave. Your salary is a little low for your rent and for uprooting your life, but if there's opportunity for advancement it's well worth it. There will be culture shocks, because you're going to be exposed to more cultures in a week than you've been exposed to in a lifetime. Things are fast here, people are blunt and politeness here is the inverse of the south. Small talk with strangers is rude, don't meander through conversations, be direct and have purpose. My top three rules in NYC are, don't fuck with anyone who knows where you live, when in doubt it's a bodily fluid and above all, Mind your fucking business."
"Adding to this--the sidewalk is our highway. Walk on the right side. If you need to pass, pass left. On escalators and stairs, same rule. 

And if you stop in the middle I will run into you and I will not apologize and I'll probably huff or make a shitty comment. "
I use mine as trash bags for my small bins. 
"No, it is not separate. If you can't afford supplies then how can you create your ""art""?"
