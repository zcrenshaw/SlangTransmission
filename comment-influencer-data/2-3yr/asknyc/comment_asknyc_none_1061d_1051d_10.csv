"When, I will take you out to dinner for your birthday if you're that lonely. I won't promise that you enjoy my company but I would love to provide it regardless."
"It's part of Sukkot. It's to try to encourage non-practicing Jews back to the flock, but it's against the rules for them to proselytize outside the faith.

"I will go against people's advice of ""how to meet people"" (ie meetups, etc) as this can really get your hopes/expectations up and lead to more frustration and depression if, by chance, you don't meet anyone.

My advice - do things for yourself.  Don't expect to meet anyone.  You're only here for two months anyway.  You're in the best city in America.  Take advantage of it.  

Get a Citibike and bike the length of Manhattan along the West Side Greenway. Go sit on a bench and watch tourists on the High Line.  Get lost in The Met, alone, without worrying about what some group you're with wants to do.  See a limited-release indie film, alone, without worrying about what some group you're with thought of it.  Walk over the Brooklyn bridge and then sit at the Promenade and read a book in front of the Manhattan skyline like you're in a fuckin Woody Allen movie.  Go to that new Ramen restaurant in Brooklyn that encourages patrons to dine alone by seating them in private stalls.

Two months in New York with your own free apartment - amazing.  You're really lucky.  You're only 20.  I wouldn't avoid being alone; I would use this opportunity to practice being alone.  Revel in it.  Master it."
"You're gonna have to go in for the long con.

You'll need bird seed, cigarettes, and clothing similar to your neighbor's.

Every morning and every evening, you're gonna dress like him, go outside onto the fire escape, light up, and feed the birds. You will do this consistently. 

The birds will learn that ""man with cigarette"" equals food. The birds will make a new friend. The new friend will not like this."
People want to stay near the doors so they can exit easily. Once you get trapped in the middle on a rush hour train getting out is a pain in the balls 
"Who said we hate the fare??

The subway runs 24/7, and you can go from one end of the city to the other on a single fare.

You'd need to lobby upstate legislators to approve more money for the MTA.

Fare increase are as inevitable as the rising cost of pizza."
You're going to steal my dog aren't you?
"I took a 12 foot projector screen on the subway home from B&amp;H a few years ago.  Made sure to do it during the afternoon when the subway wasn't so busy, and at the stop before mine I went 'Hey everybody!  Just want to let you know that me and this thing are getting off at the next stop!  Thank you!'  And everyone who was in my way moved out of my way which was nice of them.  "
Chrysler. Art Deco was the high water mark for American architecture for me.
"Your question and the content of your post isn't the same. My best NYC date definitely involved drinking and the only sporty part was horizontal. 

What is ""cheap"" for you guys? "
New York City sets the standard for almost everything.
Build your own transportation system powered by fairy dust good intentions. 
"""It made me feel like a hero. It could have been a false alarm, but it also could have been something more serious. I could have saved lives that day. It's what we owe each other in a city like ours."""
"Hey that's a very nice of you to offer that, and it's very appreciated. If you're offering company, I'd definitely take you up on that. Can't promise my company is the absolute best either but I'd definitely be excited just to be trying a new restaurant. 

My birthday is actually tomorrow (10/23), but I wasn't expecting company so if that's too short notice, definitely wouldn't mind dinner during the week if you'd rather do that. I'm a college aged guy if that changes anything. Regardless, I appreciate that you even offered at all, so thanks for that. "
I'll take little Harambe if you need a place for him. I can't have a cat in my apartment and I could use the company.
Might just be me but my favorite place in the world to read is on the subway
"If you can't afford to stay legally, you can't afford to visit. The recent bill is good for the city and its residents. Please don't try to skirt it just because you aren't the person who would suffer for the illegal use. "
Probably the Continental. I once saw someone puke in the bar and get served another drink immediately after. 
no.

I wonder if it has to do with fundraising. Some of the biggest fundraising zip codes for both parties are here in NYC.
"Hey look, I work evenings and tomorrow starts my work week, I'd love to take you out at least for a few beers next weekend and I'm sure I can get a few of the goonier members of this sub out for a few beers. It's been a while since I've seen some of the people I've known from here and I'd love to use your bleated birthday as an excuse. Are you around next Saturday around 5?"

"Also, there are more non-human surfaces to hold onto or lean against"
"Sadness, mainly"
"No we don't agree. MTA delivers the largest system in America, the only 24/7 system in America (one of only a handful in the world) at the cheapest price in America. I'm fine with the price. 

If the state wouldn't keep stealing money from the system, it would be fine. Talk to those corrupt fucks up in Albany. "

They are chabadniks. They wanted you to shake the Luvav and etrog for the holiday of sukkot. 
No one wants to wade through the great unwashed to get out.
"I wouldn't tell UPS that you know anything about it. I have had something similar happen to be before and that kind of response threw my case out the window. However someone might be able to offer better insight. 

I would call UPS and say you haven't received it yet and express that you specifically mentioned to them that you were away and needed it delivered to a store. They are the ones that messed up not you. 

What have you said to UPS so far? Have you spoken to them since you returned?"
can i join?
"Relax, buddy, I'm getting off soon, just twelve more stops."
They don't.
