"If I saw anyone of a race *other* than asian, I would stare and find it odd. However, because of the cultural phenomenon of asians wearing surgical masks, while I might glance for an extra couple seconds, it doesn't phase me at all. You will be fine. "
This is NYC. It's okay to do pretty much anything.
It is socially acceptable for Asian people to wear them. 
"Yes, if the Tennant isn't occupying the unit it's illegal. Start with the landlord and then 311. If you want to go nuclear and screw the landlord call the fire martial. If one person is holding 3 leases I have a feeling the landlord won't care."
New Yorkers of all stripes have to grow a hard outer layer in order to deal with the daily crap. This is especially true of public servants who have an 8-hour a day exposure to some of the most vile creatures. You were the innocent bystander.
"Welcome to New York.  You think you have to meet all your neighbors, move back to Ohio."
"Yes, you should call 311, the building's management company, and the homeless outreach program. Your community board might be interested in being aware of such an encampment. 

For the love of god, do NOT call 911. That is for emergencies. This is not an emergency."
"Because they deal with hundreds of thousands of people per day many of whom are not nice or are insane , they have extreme job security and they aren't tour guides."
"Congratulations. You have appeared in public in NYC in a manner that makes you comfortable but some may find eccentric. You have passed the test.  

By the power vested in me by that guy at my subway stop who wears nothing but white BVD briefs and a black leather motorcycle jacket, I hereby declare you a native New Yorker.  "
"That's pretty awesome!

* Eat at a different three Michelin Star restaurant each night.
* Get tickets to Hamilton (could spend anywhere from $1,000-3000 right here)
* Helicopter tour"
"You need to understand that kindness is often a front for a hustle, in New York people asking for help are usually asking for money or wasting your time. The problem here was not being direct, you just ask here you don't ask for permission to ask. I'm sorry you had the experience you had but hearing the full story that's kind of what I expected had happened."
"I grew up in Appalachia. 

Do not move to NYC straight out of high school with no money, no real job prospects and no college education. You will need at least 5k to get yourself in an apartment and get settled while you look for work. Experience serving at the Quaker Steak &amp; Lube doesn't count here. Getting a job waiting tables isn't easy. Retail is possible, but incredibly difficult wages to live on. 

If you really want to say fuck you to the shithole you grew up in, the best revenge is living well. It is very difficult to live well here without a plan and ""fuck it I don't care if I'm poor"" isn't a plan. Why NYC? Why not Philly? Why not Harrisburg? I know it sounds nuts given how shitty where you live is, but you're on easy mode right now and it's really not the best idea to jump straight to expert the second you turn 18 and graduate. Try an intermediate level first or develop a real game plan. 

It's also a terrible mistake to move here without ever having been here. You have no idea if you will actually like it or how much those 3AM noisy neighbors will bother you. You really have no idea what you're in for and you're setting yourself up to become part of the city's homeless population. And that really isn't better than an Appalachia farm.  "
"Yeah I'm sure. I'm from fucking New York.

Edit: Thanks for the gold!"
You live in Bushwick and you're being sensitive about marijuana odor in your building?
"That, by itself, isn't a bad thing. The internet should be available to everyone and it can be a good tool to helping people get back on their feet. 
"
"Its my first time in your fabulous city and I have a 38 minute layover at LGA, how many secret NYC hot spots can I visit before I have to be back for my flight?  None of the typical touristy stuff please.  And I'll be landing at 1am - is it safe?  Can I walk.



^^/s"
I love watching the plaincloths guys pull their badges out of their shirts and bust people soliciting on the train. This doesn't happen anywhere near often enough.
"Hey man-

First, I want you to know that even though I'm just some moron online, I care about you and what happens to you.

Call or text them today, dude, seriously. Or if you want to pm me, go for it. Just make sure you talk to somebody.

"Because checking to see if you're a fool is free.

They want to renovate the apartment so it rents for a higher price, but if they have a tenant dumb enough to pay full market price for an unrenovated apartment, hey why not.

Most people are terrible at negotiating, you'd be surprised how many people (assuming they can afford it) will just sign on the dotted line and sigh."
They probably want you out so they can renovate and charge that price for rent. You can try to negotiate but if you aren't rent regulated you're SOL.
"I do not believe you could not find the answer online. Literally millions of people need to find this info each year, it is not hard to find. I found it first try. Are you using bing or something?

http://schools.nyc.gov/Calendar/default.htm"
I have no idea who you are. You sound like a little bitch 
"Not SUPER close - but when I need a quick midtown nap, I go to the KMart in Penn Station.  The basement level has a home &amp; garden section full of outdoor furniture that no one is buying or interested in looking at, and I usually grab a chaise (sp?) lounge and fall asleep in it.  Have never been bothered."
"Man your mind is going to be blown if you ever see a coyote.

Central Park is huge, many animals live there."
"Your sister is an opiate addict, any show of emotion is pure manipulation, access to a phone, for an addict in recovery is not beneficial. As a smoker I can sympathize with wanting to be able to smoke, but she's doing this to keep out of prison or the morgue, it's time for everyone to toughen up and get her the help she needs. The only people I know who kicked junk permanently cut everyone out of their life they used to know, moved away completely or both. It's not an easy road she's going down but the alternative is literally dying."
"You're finding fault with the wrong people. The swat team isn't the problem. It's the worthless shits that like to mass murder people with assault weapons, THAT is what you should say should not happen in the US.
"
A real New Yorker would wear his mask and not give a fuck what anyone thought of it.
Because he's at home and they're on vacation. Dude presumably has work to go to in the morning.
lol 6 months
"More choices means flakier people. Cell phones also make it easier to get to know each other and even find each other but it also makes it easier to say ""heyyyy i know its 5pm and were meeting at 6:30 but something just came up that im just saying because I ust matched with this hottie from SoHo and were getting drinks tommorow at Le Bain and I can't get out early from work both nights""

Think of it like fridge, when its packed its hard to decided what to eat because you have so many choices. I could have that watermelon, but damn those chicken wings look good. Ill save those for tommorow, but then you get home and youre like damn we got pizza?! Fuck watermelon, im throwing you out. 


From my experience which i've had success, i've been dating a girl I met on tinder 3 years ago. We live together now. But before that there were a lot of stories.

 I found a lot of people would basically date you through text for like a week to get to know you, then you meet up and it was alright, then it just fizzles out. Either we both, or one of us felt meh he/she's alright but I like this other person im texting more so lets end it there but not say anything. Or it could be someones busy season at work. Always something different. 

Again this isn't unique to NYC but obviously with one of the largest dating pools in the country it happens a hell of a lot more than some random town in ohio where OKCupid consists of all the girls who got pregnant in HS and the recent divorcee's. Obviously it's not all that but thats the stereotype. 

At the end of the day and as hard as it is. I guess we can all be happy we have such a large dating pool because that means you can fuck up 100 times and still have 100 more girls to potentially date. But at the same time it can get expensive! But that's why its great to have so many nice parks, streets and neighborhoods to explore. I found the longer I dated the less I spent on a date. Save the dinner for the second date or if the first is going well grab a bite to eat.

Watch out we got a badass over here.
"After you meet people after meetups, classes ect. you have to invite them to do something outside of the meetup. It is hard and takes a very long time. I am not sure if you were doing it, but what you have been doing is the best way. You can also ask random strangers to meetup. It is really hard to make friends after you are out of school, just keep trying or just go to places solo and try to meet people that way. There is no easy way."
"Probably the people on illegal, unregistered dirtbikes speeding and popping wheelies all over the place. "
"Bars - I'd suggest that you get willing to venture outside of the Times Square area for your drinking. Amble around Greenwich Village and just pop in whatever place strikes your fancy. It's a great way to spend the day outside without too specific plans and get to see some cool bars, neat stores and the like.

Hot Dogs - Papaya or Crif is the way to go.

Italian - Zero Otto Nove

GF Stuff - Look into TodayTix app or the TKTS booth in Times Square. Both offer discount tickets - the app is up to two weeks in advance and the booth is day of. You should be able to find something great that works for you guys and will give you the experience. I really enjoyed the version of the Crucible that's on right now. 

If you google or search this sub for speakeasy, you'll find a bunch of bar suggestions like Please Don't Tell. They aren't really my thing, but it's a good way to get a good list."

"Also, what is your definition of rude? Is it not smiling and saying ""good morning"" as you got on the bus, or is it cursing at you if you asked them a question? I have relatives who constantly bemoan how rude New Yorkers are, but that's because they're used to strangers smiling and greeting each other and ""ma'am"" and ""sir"" when being spoken to. "
"So a couple of years ago some [kittens got stuck in a similar location](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/kittens-shut-subway-service-45-minutes-article-1.1440740). The MTA shut down the line for two hours to rescue them and got a lot of flack for it. I doubt they'll pull the same stunt again. 

If you really want some action, tell it to the Post or Daily News. I'm sure they'll find a way to blame it on DeBlasio. "
