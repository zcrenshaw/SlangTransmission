"cook your own meals, do not drink, do not go out unless is for a walk, do not buy blow (big saving tip right there), do not have kids (daycare is more than a mortgage), find a partner that makes equal or more than you. "
"&gt;Why am I the only one pissed that for voting power

Whenever you think you are the only one, know that you are not the only one."
"I go out drinking less, has the added benefits of being clear headed and having no friends. "
There are a lot of people who have forgotten how to function in civil society. 
"TBH more of the kids with drug problems I know, grew up on long island compared to the kids I know who grew up here. Just saying.

If your son is gonna get involved with drugs, he's gonna regardless of where he lives. 

Who are these people telling you this about NYC? They're feeding you bullshit

I think the opportunities and positives this city has for teens FAR outweighs the negatives.

Grand Central Terminal.
"this might be uncommon advice, but if you ride the subway while you're here, please take your backpack off of your back. 

there's nothing worse than someone with a large pack on their back, hitting everyone on the subway not being aware of the amount or space they are taking up"
"Why the fuck would I convince you to move here? NYC doesn't need a sales pitch and we don't want anymore transplants that think they're so much better than us. You've visited here, you haven't lived here, don't act like you even have any idea of what ""soul sucking"" is. Soul sucking is living in some cornbread ass town with some cornbread ass friends who aspire to nothing greater than being the town cop or a volunteer firefighter. Don't come here, city's closed."
"Blast from the past: Used to get a kick out of Toys R Us in Times Square, and FAO Schwarz.

"Don't use Uber or take cabs, don't do Seamless, cook your own meals, bring your lunch to work, pre-game at home before going out on weekends, do your own laundry... it's expensive no matter what."
"&gt;that kids who grow up in NYC tend to get into drugs and alcohol and partying a lot easier than those outside

I grew up in Brooklyn.  My husband grew up in a moderately wealthy suburb in the midwest.  In my opinion, the situation is the complete opposite. The amount of drugs and risky sex that  bored teens in suburbanland get into is crazy. Its literally all they do.  in NYC there's things to do other than get high and fuck.  Another thing is, most kids in NYC have never known another teen to die in a car accident.  Most of them don't have cars or access to a car. Every person I know who grew up in the burbs knows someone who died in a teen driving accident. 

However,  I'm afraid its a FACT that you do not get to control your teen when they are free with a metrocard in a city of 9 million. If you don't want your son to drink, you'll have to raise him to share your values, rather than control his actions with an iron fist as you think you can do. (hint: you're wrong). "
"My advice is that if you cannot figure out where your character would live, you do not know enough about the city to be able to convincingly write a story of someone living here. "
"Don't send your kids to a NYC private school then. Growing up it was always the prep kids that had the ~~best~~ harder drugs.

Yes, your son will be exposed to some dangerous stuff, that's part of growing up, but he'll also be exposed to so many different cultures, peoples and experiences. So many more opportunities for success than in the burbs. "
"* Save your change in a jar.
* Auto deposit a certain amount of your paycheck.
* Stop drinking.
* Brown bag lunch. Make coffee at home.
* Learn how to cook.

Not really a NYC question. We save money how everyone else does."
"&gt;how could this be possible?

Drugs cost money. Kids at private school have more money."
"If someone knows of one they know of the other, if they haven't heard of one they likely haven't heard of the other. I can't speak to the finance aspect of the question."
I hope you're a high school student and not some guy trying to fake a CV 
"If preserving an eight year long relationship with someone you love and think is awesome isn't enough to make you want to give NYC a shot, I don't see why you think strangers on a website will be able to. "
"People are talking about it, but it isn't about fixing NY's electoral votes, it's about fixing the whole electoral vote process."
"Yes. You can save money by paying less in rent. That's not really a useful suggestion.


Although don't lump all of ""Brooklyn"" and all of ""Manhattan"". There are plenty of areas in Brooklyn that are more expensive than some areas in Manhattan. 

And there are three more boroughs."
"So I had a week off too a couple years back and I did a ""five days, five borough"" challenge â€” spent a day in each borough doing something new, since I spent 99% of my time in Manhattan and north Brooklyn where I live. I love to eat, especially obscure ethnic cuisines, so most of my ""things to do"" revolved going to far-flung parts of NYC and eating at places I never normally would otherwise.

* Brooklyn - went to Brighton Beach and checked out Little Odessa, got some Uzbek food, walked around a new part of Prospect Park

* Staten Island - went to the the SI museum (yes it has a museum) and Snug Harbor (look it up) and hit up Little Sri Lanka (bet you didn't know there was one in NYC)

* Queens - got tacos in Corona, checked out the Queens Museum, went to Spa Castle, and got dumplings in Flushing

* Bronx - went to the Bronx Museum of Arts, got Dominican food, gelato on Arthur Ave.

* Manhattan - at the time I hadn't been to the new Whitney, so I did that by myself and joined one of the guided tours, hung out on the High Line (which I never normally do except when I have guests from out of town)

Obviously you don't have to do these things specifically. Other suggestions:

* Go see a lesser-known museum in an outer borough

* Go to an ethnic neighborhood in a further out area. The real Little Italy on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, the Russian/Ukrainian in Brighton Beach, Tibetan/Indian in Jackson Heights (this isn't even that far out), Latin American in Corona, Chinese/Korean in Flushing are some good starting points.

* Spa Castle out in College Point, Queens (or any other bathhouse like the Russian &amp; Turkish Baths in the East Village)

* Check out one of the big cemeteries in NYC: Green-Wood in Brooklyn, or Woodlawn in the Bronx. You can couple Green-Wood with Sunset Park (great Chinese and Mexican food), and Woodlawn with Arthur Avenue (Italian) if you want to make a day out of it.

* Get a slice at Di Fara. I've wanted to go there forever but that schlep just for a slice of pizza sounds ridiculous to me."
"It's not like you'll have free time to spend that money anyway. Take hospital housing, it might be a short term hit but makes a ton of sense in the long run when you factor quality of life. "
"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact


NY has already agreed to a contract saying that, if enough states agree to give a majority, then they agree to vote based on popular. But Republican states will never agree to sign on because the electoral college gives them power."

"For the love of God, it's Manhattan."
NYU dropouts with rich parents don't work at the Applebee's in Times Square. 
"Just FYI, the cheapest studios in the building right now are going $2391 (net effective rent), but that includes 1 free month. Gross rent on those studios is in the $2600 range, so you are getting a great deal.

If you value being in a doorman, luxury building, I would definitely take it. Also not being able to have the rent raised is invaluable.

Personally, I would take it."
Interesting fact - there have been no Citibike deaths since the program started.
"I believe you are thinking of Streit's, 150 Rivington. Closed 2015. Sold for condos."
By making more money
"Nice try, ICE."
"I don't engage and I don't feel bad, I've got my own shit that I'm dealing with, I can't internalize someone else's struggle. As for number two, donate or volunteer to one of the many charities that help the homeless."
"There has been an influx of people posting here riled up about ""doing something"" when they don't have the basic requisite foundational knowledge. Do you know about the EC state compact? Have you done any research into existing efforts to amend the electoral procedure? Have you researched viable alternatives or past proposals? No. You don't know shit about shit except for your feelings. You haven't done the work you need to do to even engage with the people who are already talking about what you're on about. 

You need to knock it the fuck off with pretending like you're woke and everyone is a complacent rube until you educate yourself. Stop making posts whining about people not agreeing with you and start posting asking how to get involved in what is already out there. The real problem isn't that people are complacent - it's that people are like you: they think they've figure out some problem or solution that somehow literally thousands of people smarter and more educated on the matter than they are missed and try to ""start a conversation"" that has been happening for fucking decades without trying to learn fuck all first.

no go away stop this
I use citymapper
This character sounds like what people in the Midwest think NYC is like.

Someone read about it in a bougie magazine.
The OP is hilariously judgmental. 
"Aw, they've got the best drugs here! Your kid's gonna have such a good time"
There are a number of phenomenal Chili's locations located just outside NYC. Great for a little getaway.
