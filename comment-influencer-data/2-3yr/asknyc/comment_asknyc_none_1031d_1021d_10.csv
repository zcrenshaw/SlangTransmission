"No, never and under no circumstances. 10/10 is a scam."
Why not airbnb a couch in queens for ~$25?
"Has it been brought up at your [community board](http://www.nyc.gov/html/cau/html/cb/brooklyn.shtml) meeting? You're surely not the only neighbor that's being affected by this, and you'll have better luck with your [precinct community council/officer](http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/community_affairs/precinctcommunitycouncils.shtml) with a greater number of people concerned with this situation. Reach out to your [council member](http://council.nyc.gov/html/members/members.shtml) to see if they can also help."
"Yeah, most of them are scams, and you grow accustomed to their pleas bouncing off your cold, cruel heart. 

There was one lady on the J who was frequently on my train going home from school, and she gave a different name and story every time. Someone finally called her out on it and they got into this huge slap fight I'll never forget, but this was in the days before cell phones and Worldstar. "
"Dude, if you have 90k annual income doing nothing, it's fine for you to do nothing. I'm sorry that you're having very real, very serious issues with your mental health, but your finances are covered, so it seems a little hyperbolic to talk about your situation like you're actually in dire straights.

Get yourself into therapy. Lots of people grew up in abusive families; lots of people have depression or other mental illness related motivational issues; lots of people hate their boring jobs. But most people don't have the luxury of living off of interest. You're in a really really really good life position, even if living in it sucks. 

And those cheery people? I'd wager loads of them aren't actually cheery, they're just faking it because they need to to get by. 

The answer you seek is: therapy, therapy, therapy, therapy."
"For the thousandth fucking time, we don't think about LA. "
"If it's a talented performer on the street or in a subway STATION (once you get on the train and force people to listen you can fuck right off), I'll give a few bucks if I stop to listen. 

If it's someone with a cup or a ""I'm sorry I don't mean to be rude me and my grandson are homeless waiting for my disability..."" or whichever sob story then definitely not."
"My tip- Don't go.

It's miserable. It's cold. You're getting shoved around. There's literally NO WHERE to go. The amount of people forced into that square is insane. Just don't. I've tried the past few years and every time it leaves you miserable. 

If you REALLY want to watch it happen, get a reservation at a restaurant overlooking the tree (like specifically ask for a table next to the window overlooking the tree). Though that'll cost a lot of money as that's a nice area.

Or, you could watch it on your TV and be nice and toasty and even opt for room delivery. "
You will definitely die. 
"I have given money to talented buskers.

I give people begging food if I have any to give, last time I had a bagel with a cream cheese packet form panera I was saving but gave to a guy begging for food or money for food. Occasionally if I go to buy food I'll buy something extra and give to someone I see. I don't give them money, though. "
The bucket drumming guy at 34th St station is pretty fire
please don't encourage them
"If their shoes are in tatters, they get my dough."
Because women willing  to spin on a pole in front of miserable fucks can make a LOT more money elsewhere.
Take a hike down to pizza suprema. 
"I think this sub pretty much did this already. Hit all of the Time Square restaurant bars. Depending on when, I might be down. 

Actually Idk, I really hate all the bars that we really hate. "
"I'm not sure about storage, but remember, the key to eating a black and white cookie is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than vanilla and chocolate. And yet, still, somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only look to the cookie. All our problems would be solved."
"Anyone ever see that guy on the G train who goes on this longwinded story about how he needs 8 cents to buy a train ticket to Long Island? Then he gets super angry when no one gives it to him?

Bro, I don't know what you get yourself into, but if find yourself stranded on a G train several times a week maybe it's time to stop coming into the city."
"I hope you're joking about Olive Garden. If you want good pizza in TS, check out [John's Pizzeria](http://www.johnspizzerianyc.com/Times-Square-Menu/Pizza) located on the south side of 44th street between 7th Ave and 8th Ave (closer to 8th Ave)."
DeBlasio has vowed to delete the city's database of illegal immigrants rather than let it be used by Trump's administration. So take heart that people here are fighting for you. 
"John's is the only place to go in Times Square, it's awesome"
"$90k a year doing nothing? Dude. Fuck paying $3k a month in NYC. Find a city where rent is cheap, and go explore the world with the extra $2k or so that you'll have in your pocket. 

In your situation? Fuck a regular job. Focus on getting enjoyment out of life."
"Do you have a working carbon monoxide (CO) detector in your home? Mild CO poisoning can cause hallucinations and paranoia, in addition to headaches and dizziness. Please get this checked out before tragedy strikes; CO is odorless and can kill you very quickly. "
I pay taxes here. And have little savings since I pay for everything out of pocket. Thank you.
"Rent: a ton

Taxes: Too much

Commuting costs: Hellacious

Having NYC at your fingertips: Priceless"
The airport? If you're wearing nice clothes people will think you're just waiting for the next flight 
AKA Rudy Giuliani. 
"The ""where they treat you like family"" part is a common joke on this sub."
It is extremely hard to sue the city. I suggest you start looking around when you walk. 
"AMEN. Rockefeller Center turns into an unimaginable, unescapable hellmouth at christmas time. I've never been around so many people shoving each other, rolling their strollers over the elderly and generally spreading their shitty christmas cheer all over the place at the expense of their fellow humans. "
"when my friends and i visited years ago we spent one night in central park, which we figured would be safe because the police patrols would keep anyone potentially dangerous out. very flawed logic. instead of counting sheep we fell asleep while simultaneously snapping into action to dodge the headlights of oncoming patrol cars every 10 minutes. eventually we fell asleep in a nook outside of any car's vantage point, with the only interruption being the commotion of a nearby group of teenagers getting busted for trespassing, and the threat of cops that were now very close to our nook. before we could army crawl out of sight to a better position, however, a brazen raccoon approached the foot of my sleeping bag and stood on its hind legs, which was super frightening. it put us in a pickle of running away from the potentially rabies-carrying raccoon and getting caught by the cops on the other side of our hill. the raccoon and cops eventually left, and it was pretty much sunrise at that point. anyways i don't recommend central park.

the next night we looked on the subway map for the largest patch of green the farthest away from manhattan. i guess we ended up in what i know now is van cortlandt park. we set up hammocks deep in the woods and got a pretty good nights sleep, no interruptions.

now when we visit we stay in an airbnb."
