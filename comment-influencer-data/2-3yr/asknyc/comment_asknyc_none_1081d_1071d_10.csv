"Hey, I was at Food Bazaar in LIC on Thursday around 4pm, I match that description and all I bought were ""funky fruits"", was that were you were? Because if yes that's me you saw!

Edit: [A bowl of the fruit I bought](http://imgur.com/gallery/z2dDe)"
"This is so crazy!

Everyone has answered regarding the fruit properly, this year in particular I went out of the way to buy some more of the exotic fruits I've never had before. 

Regarding my clothing, I have the beard and peyot (sidelocks) because I am Hasidic. Like /u/soadmind said, we Jews come in all different shapes and sizes. So there are Hasidim who dress very traditionally, in the long black coats with hats etc. and there are Hasidim who dress like everyone else. As well as other types of Jews that dress more traditional and others that dress regularly. 

So cool that I stumbled upon a thread about me, and don't worry it wasn't offensive."
"The clerk won't know anything about it, however, you can use the mta website to request a Delay Verification letter. (Google ""mta delay verify"").

However if this is happening frequently, you are cutting your commute too close, you should be leaving more time. "
"wow, yeah this is you. So now answer the questions I guess"
"No. Unfortunately, this is a cultural difference. You're expected to be on time, even with reasonable delays of subways. Show up extra early and get a coffee or something on the days you're early. The good news is extreme, unreasonable delays are infrequent and are usually acceptable at most work places, so long as it happens infrequently. 

The other good news is, most people in nyc know that trains get delayed sometimes, and usually don't care if someone is five minutes late on occasion. If it's happening more than once a week, you need to plan your commute better. But it's possible your particular employer won't tolerate even five minutes once a week. If this is the case, leave earlier and plan for delays. "
"New York City is actually quite famous for being accepting of gays, I'm suprised this is even a question honestly. You can access the top of the Empire State Building until 1am and it's usually a little emptier at that time."
Yes
"&gt;I rather ask here then on the jewish subreddit because i dont want to offend anyone for whatever reason

You can offend people here as well although I don't consider your post offensive.

&gt;2. what were all the fancy fruits for?

Fancy is not the point.  It is customary to bring in the Jewish New Year by eating a fruit that is new to you (i.e. that you have not had in at least the past year).  People buy the more exotic fruits to be certain they qualify as ""new.""

"NYC is probably the most gay-friendly city in the country outside of San Francisco. You could go virtually anywhere in the city to propose and anyone around you is more likely to clap/congratulate you than anything.

Best of luck with the proposal!"
"Many Saturday mornings, for years, we have had a guy who drives around in a red truck, up and down the streets, ringing a bell. When you hear the bell getting closer, you know he's almost at your street and you can go down and get your kitchen knives sharpened."
"At the end of every line the train operator must conduct a brake test.  The test is dumping all the air out of the brake line and recharging it. 
The conductor cannot open the doors until the test is complete. 

This is why you also hear that air dump sound before the doors open at the terminal station. "
Sorry dad ðŸ˜”.
Great advice here. A lot of people won't take this as an excuse because they probably have people who take the subway who make it on time consistently due to leaving way ahead of time. 
"OP asked for a restaurant you go to regularly, Olive Garden should be saved for special occasions."
"Wake up to an alarm clock.

Look out the window, dress accordingly.

Stumble blearily to the nearest bodega and pay a dollar for some shit coffee because the baristas at the hip spot across the street ask too many questions and charge too much for black coffee.

Go to the subway station, pack like sardines into a car.

Report to any office building, sit in the lobby for 8 hours and contemplate every choice you've ever made, break for lunch around 1:30, wait in line behind a tourist from Dallas who won't shut the fuck up about northerners not being nice. Behind you will be someone in an NYU sweater talking about how amazing whatever bar the gothamist/bushwickdaily/Bedford and Bowery did an article on yesterday is. You will order something simple, they will fuck it up.

After fake work, go to a bar, any bar, because the part of your brain that registers joy only works one day a week. Order a cheap beer, get shit from some rube about the oppressive beer conglomerate that owns said beer company and how he supports local Brewers. Ignore him and repeat 3 times.

Get on the subway, wait for some assholes to start doing backflips and then talking shit when you don't pay.

Go home to your over priced apartment, sit down on your favorite sitting implement. Turn on NY1, light your bong, kick your feet up and repeat after me: I Love this fucking town."
Can people still be rude to the next German who doesn't want to tip?
"People bring out lawn chairs to the sidewalk and then sit there. Quietly, just looking around. Very odd."
"One of three reasons that I can tell

1) They are wealthy by inheritance. Their families are super rich, they have trust funds, and paying $10K/m for a 2br is a drop in the bucket.

2) They are working 100 hour weeks at financial firms making a quarter mil in salary, plus perhaps just as much in bonuses. 

3) Their families bought condos or co-ops decades ago when it was cheap, and the kids now live in there. "
"No offence taken by your question. As mentioned already, it's Rosh Hashana (Jewish new year) this week and a tradition of the new year is to start off by eating a new fruit, religious people say a special blessing for when they do something new so it gives the immediate opportunity to say this blessing in the new year. 

As to your 2nd question, Jews come in all shapes and sizes, especially in New York! You have the guys with the black hats, you have the ones that look like David Schwimmer and everything in between. So if you saw a guy with a beard, long side burns and regular secular clothes, he's probably on the more orthodox side of the spectrum, but maybe his garb is just at the dry cleaners. "
"So you're visiting a place but refuse to adapt to the local customs? Yeah, that's going to go swimmingly for you. Please do save everyone your myriad of studies regarding the tipping system and do yourself a favor by patronizing establishments that do not utilize tipped employees. There is a good reason your wife is uncomfortable with this and you know exactly why. "
"1. You're an idiot.

2. 3 hours ago you posted about looking for friends at college now you're moving to NYC? Stop dreaming out loud, we both know this isn't happening stop turning to the Internet for answers.

3. This is a stupid plan, either you're the type of person who acts rashly and figures shit out as they go or you aren't. If you're coming to this super specific subreddit for help, you aren't. "
Shana tova.
"2003: For me, it was fun. There was a real party vibe in my neighborhood. Everyone out on the streets. We all slept on the roof... Stores and restaurants started to give away food that would spoil or melt. There was a bonfire in the local park. That is the just the perspective of a young 20 something. "
"yes, he robs the mta of the money. he has a illegal card that is bent in a way to works with the turnstyles"
"If this happening frequently enough that you are finding it embarrassing/problematic at work, I think you're going to have to adjust to the fact that our subway system is less reliable than what you are used to, and start building in some more time for your commute.  BBnet3000 has sent a link I've never heard of before to get a verification of a delay, but in my experience it's not a normal thing around here for workers to try to put being late on the MTA on a regular basis, only for really unusual circumstances "
"There are three holidays in this Jewish month. Rosh HaShannah begins tonight, Yom Kippur is on October 12th and Sukkos is October 17th, so starting the night of the 17th I will be spending plenty of time in a Sukkah"
"Go for Top of the Rock - more of the skyline to see (you can't see the Empire State Building while on top of the Empire State Building). If you want something less touristy, the Brooklyn Bridge Promenade also has a nice view. "
"Please don't do this. It's a when in Rome situation. The standard here for sit-down restaurant service, whether you like it or not, is a 15% to 20% tip, and doing otherwise only punishes the restaurant staff. 

If you're so adamant against tipping, either eat only at places where tipping is not expected (fast food, take out, self-service) or patronize one of an increasing number of higher-end restaurants that have raised prices but eliminated tipping: http://www.grubstreet.com/2015/12/all-nyc-restaurants-no-tipping.html "
Yes. Same frauds from the west coast. 
"Another thing is that a lot of people browse reddit on mobile. I didn't even know sidebars existed, except for the amount of mention I've seen on this subreddit.

I did, of course, know that I can search for previous posts.

Also, we forget that most of the rest of the world is inferior to NYC. The idea of ""where should I go for dinner"" sounds ridiculous, but if you live in a town with 3 restaurants, it's a question. "
Toms Diner is also terrible. Horrible food and crazy prices. There are a TON of other diners in NYC that are actually good.
"My neighbor across the street has 5 cars, ranging from beat up 98 civic to '16 Audi A8. The amount of shuffling around he makes with those cars to secure parking for himself and his family is something that one day I would tape and then will play a speed up version with Benny Hill's music soundtrack. Alternate side days are particularly rough for him. "
"You're going to get some transplant or tourist mugged. I said it in the last thread and I'll say it here, no, not all of New York is safe all of the time, and it's okay for people to ask that without being berated. "
Real Buddhist monks don't try to sell you things in the street.
"I'm not sure if I'd recommend the Greenway.  While it's mostly straight, it can also be narrow in places, and full of idiots (both on other bikes and pedestrians).

Central Park's loop is probably better, in that it's relatively wide.  It can be crowded and full of idiots, but they're more avoidable, particularly north of, hmm, 86th Street."

Huh. TIL. I'm a 40-something jew. lol

Now THIS is the quality of trolling i expect on this sub.
"Give up hope. 

Hear me out. When you're desperate, like you seem right now, you are not a fun date. As much as you ""try"" to pretend to ""be cool"" and ""fun"" and ""witty,"" if a state of desperation exists inside your brain, chances are you will most certainly not be cool, fun, witty. The best actors in the world sometimes fail to produce chemistry on screen--if you're pressing, it's gonna show big. 

So give up. Give up in the sense that you will no longer put pressure on yourself to perform. Instead, become who you want to be on your own. Get comfortable in your skin. When you plan a date, don't try to impress... Just look to have a good time. You'll know you're headed in the right direction when you're not trying so hard and you're just enjoying yourself. Meet a person and just be genuinely interested in sharing an experience with them--the food, the movie, the show, the game.  And if it doesn't go well, don't take it hard. Chalk it up as an experience. 

Give up on trying and just have fun. You'd be amazed at what a difference it makes to pull an Office Space and just don't give a fuck. Take yourself less seriously and just look to explore. "
"Here are some of the reasons:

- Traffic can back up a long, long way during busy times
- No train access to LGA
- Confusing terminal naming/numbering scheme. Terminal B has concourses A, B, C, D; and there are separate Terminals A, C, and D. 
- Terminals are not well connected to each other. 
- Extremely cramped inside, both in the terminal and at the gate
- Terminal B, the busiest terminal, is in desperate need of renovations and modernization
- Terrible signage all throughout the airport
- Lack of a unified security entry point, even for each concourse in Terminal B
- Very limited amenities. And due to the lack of a unified security point, accessing amenities at other concourses/terminals is impossible
- Poor parking options, both airport and off-site
- The most unhappy staff you've ever seen at an airport, and airline staff (ticket agents, gate agents) don't seem to be much happier either
