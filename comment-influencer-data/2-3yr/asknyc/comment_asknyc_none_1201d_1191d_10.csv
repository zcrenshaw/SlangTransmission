"Burp Castle. Patrons get shushed by the bartender, you'll love it!"
"In my case, by doing it 20 years ago."
Some are privately owned. Closing the smaller entrances at night funnels people into the better-lit and trafficked larger ones to deter crime.
"It's not worth NYPD's time.

Even if a citizen managed to get the NYPD to care about it, NYPD would fob you off to Sanitation because it's an obstruction on the sidewalk, Sanitation would fob you off to DOT because they control uses in the right-of-way, DOT would fob you off to Health because it's a food issue, Health would fob you off to DCRA because it's an unlicensed business, and DCRA would tell you to call the police because they have no enforcement capability.

And that's how things work in New York."
"I wouldn't venture out. Brits still not welcomed on 4th of July. It's an old NYC 4th of July tradition to capture one, hogtie them and force them to drink cawkfee instead of tea. "
You might be spending too much money on cocaine and domination escorts.
Removing your soul is the hard part.  The lying and cheating gets easier after that.   
craigslist is your homepage and CAPSLOCK IS ALWAYS ON
"Because, unlike Los Angeles, we enjoy doing things *on time.* That means we're in a rush for everything. 

When I went to LA, I felt like the people were made of molasses. Holy shit do you people personify the word ""mosey."""
"What the fuck are you trying to do, ruin the fun for everyone? 

Keep your big mouth shut and let the sweet wine flow. "
"Just remember, every kid selling fruit snacks is one less kid doing the subway showtime. Keep them in business!"
"Being a New Yorker all my life, I'm going to tell you the reality of what's going on. Normally, all the stuff you're doing should eradicate them *unless there's someone in the building ""breeding"" them*, meaning a hoarder, or a ground floor business (like a restaurant). Your super has to find a way to get into every apartment to see who this person is. Trust me, there is someone else causing this problem and they probably live in your line or very near it. The other explanation is if your apartment is on the same wall as the trash compactor chute. Those apartment tend to have problems."
"You don't move to an insanely expensive city to work a low wage job. You're thinking of it incorrectly - it's not that people who were born here are less economically successful than people born elsewhere, it's that you never see the economically unsuccessful people born elsewhere."
"The law says that you can't rent an entire domicile without the owner/lessee living there during your stay. It's to stop people from turning empty housing stock into full time hotels. 
Be sure to ask your AirBnb host about this. "
"The unlicensed vending is mostly poor people trying to scrape by selling to other poor people in poor neighborhoods, turning a blind eye to it makes our city a better place. But if you're trying to sell ""artisanal"" products to an upmarket crowd, you should be prepared for a lot of complaints/reports from your competition and more responsive policing."
"I'd get the unlimited Olive Garden subscription and eat there 24/7. 

Honestly? I'd do a lot of walking. Do east-west and north-west day-long walks of Brooklyn, The Bronx, and Queens. Do several day-long walks of Manhattan. 

I've done those a bunch of times. Yeah, there are a few boring stretches but for the most par you're seeing neighborhoods you would probably never see otherwise, eating food at great places you'd never seek out on purpose, and seeing more of the city than most lifelong residents ever see. "
Subway cars. 
"If Manhattanhenge fails, then so will our crops during the growing season.  We will need to sacrifice a virgin ewe and sprinkle the pure blood on the fields of planted sorghum in Bryant Park.

(If you plan on schlepping over to Gantry State Park to see the sunset through the gaps in the skyline, then obviously no, since you won't see a sunset)."
You'll be fine as long as the trains not packed. 
Pita. Naan is Indian bread.  Pita is generally Middle Eastern/Mediterranean 
"I work for Citi Habitats, and we compile very comprehensive market reports every month on average prices for every size apartment in most Manhattan neighborhoods.

"Based on your post history this alarms me. NYC is not a place to go to run away from your problems in your current town. It's not easy to find a job in any industry here, even in fast food, because of the sheer amount of people.

You sound like you have issues to iron out with yourself to be happy with yourself first. If you move here, you will have the same exact problems you have right now, just in a different (and more overwhelming) place. They won't go away. Too many people come here in your situation and end up on the street and I'd hate for that to happen to you.

My advice to you is that you realize your dream to move here by getting back to school in your current town, getting some work experience, and coming here when you have real job prospects, savings in the bank, and are happy."
Depends on how fast you can run
We'll make a deal. We'll stay here if you stay there.
"Online. Tinder for (mostly) people looking to hook up, OkCupid for (mostly) people looking for relationships.


You can try meeting people randomly at bars, and it works for some, but I've always found it to be too much of a crap shoot, and you'll probably wind up spending a lot of time drinking."
"Your own apartment in the village for $700 a month.. Well assuming you are writing from the 1960s I don't see a problem.
"
It's often cheaper to rent rather than buy in NYC. I notice your post has no reference to math despite talking about education.
