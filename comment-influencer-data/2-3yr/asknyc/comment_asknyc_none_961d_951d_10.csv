"First off, conservatives hate him on principle because he's a progressive (*not* a Bloomberg-style social liberal/fiscal conservative) and former staffer of Hillary Clinton. He also used his family, particularly his biracial [son](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgvXniTz7D8), in campaign ads to win (oh no, a politician trying to use his family! [No one](http://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/d2674db/2147483647/resize/300x%3E/quality/85/?url=%2Fcmsmedia%2Fa2%2F6e896af8438027b21f47199b695c88%2F20560fe_pr_0209Obamas.jpg) has *ever* [done that before!](http://12631-presscdn-0-70.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/people-mccain.jpg)). Also, his wife is black and [used to be a lesbian](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/election/de-blasio-wife-chirlane-mccray-talks-lesbian-article-1.1339398). So a lot of things that [conservatives just have a strong distaste for](http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/03/republican-primaries). I imagine a conservative seeing [this image](http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1560336.1388263849!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_750/inaug29n-1-web.jpg), for example, and just becoming filled with rage.

Some Liberals, as is there wont, hate him because he's not perfect. So they do their little thing where they fracture &amp; in-fight and make it easier for conservatives to make gains because the liberal base is busy fighting over their pet causes and [semantics](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/the-scourge-of-the-left-too-much-stigma-not-enough-persuasion/508961/) (see also: 2016 presidential election). Although, to be fair, since DeBlasio won the primary in an upset against the [presumed front-runner Christine Quinn](https://www.nytimes.com/video/nyregion/100000002461740/hers-to-lose.html), the voters felt that they had made a statement by electing DeBlasio that they wanted a true unabashed progressive in the mayor's seat, only to be disappointed on his effectiveness once he took office (which the voters were responsible for delivering him).

Also, a lot of it is spin. Some people say the [New York media really wanted Christine Quinn to win](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/25/opinion/sunday/two-endorsements.html?pagewanted=all) the primary (she lost largely due to her support of a Bloomberg 3rd term) and are dead-set on using their platform to turn the public against DeBlasio. DeBlasio shows up late to press conferences, so members of the media write critical things about a politician because he *made them wait* (nothing a journalist hates more than the sense that they're less important than the figures they cover). Petty crap like that, DeBlasio generally hasn't played the press well (and probably thought that initial honeymoon phase when he won the primary would last a bit longer). There's also a weird thing where people don't like that he still frequents his Park Slope neighborhood and continues to [work out at his local gym](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cops-mayor-face-demand-wage-hike-article-1.2735261) (this is always discussed as if he's super-pampered because he goes to a *goddamn YMCA* to run laps). [Bloomberg went to his house in Bermuda practically every weekend during his tenure](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/nyregion/26bermuda.html), but DeBlasio is somehow a monster for taking his motorcade into Brooklyn for a workout. You could easily imagine the press doing the opposite with this factoid for someone they like (*""despite his heavy workload, Mayor Bloomberg even finds time each day for a workout at his old neighborhood gym instead of the state-of-the-art gym at Gracie Mansion. Locals admire how Bloomberg has stayed connected to his roots"" or some such horseshit*).

A good example of anti-DeBlasio spin: The NY Post has [written a lot about homelessness](http://gothamist.com/2016/03/09/homeless_person_front_page_news.php) since DeBlasio was elected, [as if it became worse under DeBlasio](http://gothamist.com/2014/08/08/squeegee_men.php) when *in fact* [homelessness rose significantly under Bloomberg](http://gothamist.com/2017/01/14/de_blasio_homeless.php) due to actions like eliminating the Advantage rental assistance program and cutting off shelter residents' access to public housing apartments and Section 8 vouchers. And of course, the Post writes about homelessness *not* in the ""How do we help these people?"" angle, but in the highly-dignified ""Ewww! Gross! I saw a filthy bum on my way in to the city from Westchester and the vagrant *looked at me*! Quality of Life issue!!!"" perspective. 

The Post is *also* very deferential to the NYPD. The NYPD hates DeBlasio, basically, so The Post does their part to make it seem like New York City is becoming crime-ridden to instill fear in the populace and basically be the mouthpiece for the police (see: the [""return of the squeegee man""](http://gothamist.com/2014/08/10/resurgent_squeegee_men_scourge_snuf.php) bullshit articles they constantly peddle). [Gothamist put it well](http://gothamist.com/2015/07/13/homeless_pawns_murdoch_agenda.php):

&gt;why does the New York Post persist? Politics. They're owned by a conservative billionaire who detests our leftist mayor, particularly his efforts (so far blocked by Governor Cuomo) to increase taxes on the rich. Rupert Murdoch knows that the only way a Democratic incumbent mayor is going to lose a re-election in New York City is if the local populace feels unsafe. Thus, the need for wall-to-wall coverage of violent crime (which is down 6.42% overall this year...

Another good example of pointless criticism: [DeBlasio *totally* should've rushed to the scene of a police standoff in Staten Island, for some reason](http://gothamist.com/2015/08/14/de_blasio_critics_outrage.php). I mean, the police were there handling the situation, but for some *very good* reason, DeBlasio should've personally inserted himself into the drama, turned it into a photo-op, and maybe threw a couple flash grenades at the suspect for good measure. Because that's why we elect Mayors, to be first-responders?/s/ Where was DeBlasio during all of this? Once again, the gym! Oh my God! Horrors!  

Finally, [Bloomeberg was a unique person to have as mayor](http://nymag.com/news/politics/bloomberg/), and DeBlasio sometimes suffers in comparison to the grandiosity of the Bloomberg era. Bloomberg could do things like [cut city funding for the arts and then turn around and spend $32 MILLION out of his own personal fortune to make up for the cuts.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703584804576144612225003844) If you're not a billionaire, you can't just cut spending and still fund programs with your own money. That's what's known as ""normalcy"", but after 3 terms of Bloomberg, some New Yorkers got used to having their cake and eating it too."

"If they're old, cabs (and buses) are easier on the knees than the subway. Plus, they might have outdated ideas of what the subway is like, or conversely they're young and may have seen too many worldstar videos, and think it's dangerous. 

In any case, if they're being stubborn, simply make dinner plans the first night they're here somewhere around Trump Tower and they'll quickly rethink their anti-subway plans."
"Change jobs. Seriously. I work 10-6 M-F in a tech job and when I go home, that's it. There's the occasional weekend on-call issue, but otherwise, work-life balance is well-respected. No startup is worth almost 100 hours a week of your time unless its your own and you're okay with it. As a programmer with any bit of experience, you hold the negotiating power right now. Companies are competing on who can have the best salaries, snacks in the office, free lunches, spa passes, massage sessions, etc. Pack your stuff and go apply at one of the 5000 tech companies in the city that offer those perks along with a respectable work-life balance."
"&gt; What can de Blasio do to get the police to like him? 

Tell them its ok to kill whomever they want to without consequences, but hopefully he will not do that."

"It's absolutely a scam, and they absolutely botched it, either because they were nervous, or high or both. The bottle is supposed to break and it's filled with something worthless, just brown water (the white Hennessy thing is maybe an attempt to inject creativity into the scam?). The second guy is supposed to come in as an unrelated ""witness"" to apply pressure, i.e., ""Just pay the guy man, I saw you broke his bottle!"" The intimidation is a back up plan. In these instances, its best to keep on walking, and if they follow or attempt to intimidate, yell loudly, ""I'm calling the police!"" or ""You tried this scam on me last week!"" and get to a busy area quickly. The guys who pull this are usually hustlers looking for a quick buck, not really violent, but you never know how things may escalate if you stick around."

Yes.
"We hate him. We've hated him for years. He was, at best, New York's racist con man uncle - someone who we knew was an awful cheating piece of shit, but who every now and then was sorta fun or outlandish. 

But he was always transparently shitty, stupid, and malevolent. And for those of us New Yorkers who like to imagine that we don't look down on country folk, it feels as if this election has confirmed many of the stereotypes we didn't want to believe about small town Americans - that they are, at least by a slim majority, a bunch of gullible rubes with small minds and smaller hearts. 

We literally can't understand how someone can look at him and not know that he's utterly full of shit. As Bloomberg said at the DNC, ""I'm a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one."" 

And as the top terrorist target in the country many of us are fucking aghast that he's been elected, that he's basically taunting and provoking terrorists, that he's made Midtown into an even more desirable target, and that he's not even taking his fucking security briefings. I think if we underwent another serious attack you'd see genuine violence erupt outside his properties. 

He is pursuing paths that will actually kill a lot of people, and will make even more people demonstrably more miserable. He can go fuck himself for all I care. "

"I volunteered heavily for the Bernie campaign, here in Brooklyn and across the country. Bernie lost NYC because his staffers were terrible. They didn't hold a single event until January, three months after voters were able to change their party affiliation. They opened a Brooklyn office in Gowanus first, despite the fact that everyone from TBNY agreed that Flatbush would have been a much better location. They did eventually open one there, but only two weeks before the primary. They prioritized turf containing mostly white voters, even though we needed to make serious inroads with African American voters. Bernie's rallies in NYC did not have staffers signing up people to events, or registering new voters. If the campaign had listened to the grassroots organizers, he would have won."
