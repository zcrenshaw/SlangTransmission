Go down the right side. Shoulder check if/when necessary.
"No, you do not wait for them to get out. You walk down the right side and people who are walking up on the wrong side of the stairs should stop and scoot themselves back in line on the other side to let you get down to your train.

They have already reached their destination, they can take some time to let you down the stairs."

"If you can dispute it in the mail (or even on a day off) I think it might be worth it on principle and the money.  If you Google around for a bit, these late-night violations have been thrown-out before by judges.

Check out [Section 1050.7 section j] (http://web.mta.info/nyct/rules/rules.htm); it's quite possible you weren't even in violation.  Occupying more than one seat is only illegal when interfering with the train's operation, or to disrupt other passengers."
"When I first moved to the city, I ran into this lady as I was leaving the Trade Fair. She was in front of my heading outside - brace arm cane things on each arm, struggling with handfuls of bags, sweet little old lady looking type. She turns around to me, hands me a handful of bags saying ""here, hold this shit"" while she produces a pack of cheapass off brand cigarettes and lights one. I offer to help her get her bags home and ever schlep them up to her walk up, where I am greeted by her insane dogs. When I get inside, the first thing she tells me is to never fucking do what I just did ever again and that that is the first lesson and I'm lucky she's not a fucking lunatic like her middle child, that asshole would probably have robbed me. The rest of her family had fled to Florida; she said she'd rather fucking die in the hands of the morons in Queens Mt Sinai than move to Florida. She drank ouzu like it was water. She showed me around the city, taught me a lot of curse words and insults, and became my drinking and smoking buddy for the better part of a decade before she passed away last year.

"Hey, have you been to the LGBT Center? It's on 13th Street between 7th and 8th. I'd recommend stopping by and speaking with a youth counselor, who may be able to put you in the right direction. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of things at once and you should speak to a professional about what to address first. It's a walk in center, so you can just go in and talk to someone about what resources they have available.. "
Sounds like someone's worried about the election...

"&gt;that way i wont get charged for those two weeks?

That isn't how it works, what you should have done was thought ahead and bought 2 7-day passes instead of getting your usual 30-day. If you don't want it to truly go to waste then find a trusted friend without an unlimited and let them use it."

A lot of the dumpling places in Chinatown sell frozen 5 lb bags for dirt cheap. If you're a student on a budget then that is a delicious resource.   
"Get off and go to the next car.

Or if you are the adventurous type, use the doors between the cars."
Walking for 12 miles will do that to you. Don't try to do too much all at once. Explore a little at a time; NYC will keep you fascinated all your life. 
You can cancel a lost unlimited metrocard. They will reimburse you from the day that you call and leave a VM or speak to an operator. Which ever happens first. First time you do this it is free. 2nd time it charges you $5. 
We should build a pillory in the middle of Lincoln Center where he should be kept for several days and passersby should be permitted to throw rotten tomatoes at him.
"&gt; Are all rent-stable apartments awarded by lottery?

No. While new apartments allocated through the lottery ([Housing Connect](https://a806-housingconnect.nyc.gov/nyclottery/lottery.html)) are rent stabilized, existing rent stabilized apartments are not. In fact, most are *not* awarded through the lottery.

&gt; Do you need to be earning under $40,000 a year to get one?

No. Except for buildings that received specific tax exemptions from the city, there are generally no income bands for obtaining a rent stabilized apartment. The notable exception being that if you are in a rent stabilized unit and your rent exceeds $2,700 AND your household income exceeds $200,000, your unit can be deregulated.

&gt; Are there any alternatives to rent-stable apartments?

Not really. At least none that you would be eligible for unless you have a relative living in a rent controlled apartment. There are other affordable housing programs, but those units require a lottery and/or wait list--and they're also rent stabilized anyway. It's much easier to find a rent stabilized unit in the open market, as wait lists can be years long.

&gt; Or is everyone stuck paying $1500 for an apartment in the city?

Honestly, depending on the size of the unit and location, that is fairly low. Even if you do find a rent stabilized unit, it's very unlikely that it would be priced &lt;$1,500. If your budget is less than that amount, you're probably better off having roommates.

**Advice**

* Rent stabilized units are most often in buildings with 6+ units, built before 1974, and are less than $2,700/mo.

* Check out this [map of likely rent stabilized buildings](https://chenrick.carto.com/viz/c591fa2e-726b-11e6-83e8-0e05a8b3e3d7/public_map). The big caveat here is that individual units are rent stabilized, not entire buildings.

* Keep applying to all buildings on Housing Connect that you're eligible for.

* On StreetEasy, try doing a search in the keywords section for ""Rent Stabilized""

* If you work with a broker, they'll be able to easily sort out rent stabilized units because they are usually indicated as so on the listings that the brokers see. The downside to this is that you probably have to pay a fee, but if you plan on staying in the unit for a long time maybe this isn't a bad investment.

* You're more likely to find a studio or perhaps a 1 bedroom that is stabilized, as compared to a larger unit size.

* Certain neighborhoods have much higher proportions of rent stabilized units than others.

* There are nearly 1.03 million rent stabilized units, which represents almost half of the rental housing stock in the city. While it's true that the tenure for tenants in rent stabilized buildings is longer on average, it just goes to show that it isn't impossible to find such a unit.

"You will get the usual dirty look or even the nasty comment, but they can go f* themselves.  Just keep walking, you have the right of way."
"I say this with all seriousness, get her into biking. My fiance came to love the city so much more freeing herself from the subway. There are great bike lanes into the city from Ft. Greene"

"No, you've gotta wedge into the right side and start moving down and people coming up will adjust."
I don't know if its so much that I love it here at this point as much as it is is everyplace else seems so pathetic by comparison.
Stolen is when it says Delivered and you don't have it.
"You shouldn't get a nasty look or comment, the people who are walking on the left know they are in the wrong. The giant group of people leaving the 23rd St F line weekday mornings is a good example of people clogging the stairs but moving to the right without being prompted when people are trying to walk down the stairs.

Now, trying to get through the turnstiles when a train arrives and everyone rushes out...that's a whole different shit show."
"When I lived in a walkup they always brought it upstairs to my door. I definitely factored in the stairs when I tipped, toss an extra buck or so depending on how much crap they carried. When I truly did not want to pay the extra for my stairs I just ordered food for pick-up and grabbed it myself. Is it truly necessary? Probably not, but if you're on a high floor it certainly is appreciated.

Now that I am in an elevator building, they do not get extra tip for riding the elevator up."
"Been living in NYC for 9 years &amp; the app I use most is ""Exit Strategy NYC Subway Map."" Basically it tells you exactly what subway car (even where in that car) to stand so you'll be nearest the exit at your destination station. This might not sound like a big deal, and maybe it's just me, but it's very satisfying not to walk sometimes blocks underground &amp; add minutes to your trip. Also it's a detailed subway map in your pocket. $3.99. One of the few apps I've been happy to pay for. 

Tip 18-20% minimum. Do it. "

"My heart goes out to you, it sounds like you've been through hell and still have a little ways to go.

I work with a lot of municipal NYC agencies and spend a lot of time kicking around the nyc.gov websites.  I've seen that there are resources available for homeless LGBT youth, particularly ones with transitional housing and job training. I have a feeling you are already more familiar with these programs than I am but I wonder if any of the following might be helpful for you?  In particular, getting hooked up with a social worker or a counselor who might be able to take some of the weight off of your shoulders could be invaluable.  I may be incredibly naive but I would imagine you have had to figure things out on the fly for quite a while now and having someone on your side who can advocate for you would hopefully be a step in the right direction. Particularly since you are aging out of the youth programs, now would be the time to avail yourself of as much as possible.

I have had many friends work at Green Chimneys and my family has been tangentially involved for years.  I know that they have many people on staff who are deeply invested in the well being of the young people they serve.  This page says that they have a transitional living program for homeless LGBTQ youth. http://www.greenchimneys.org/nyc/

Simply calling 311 alone can get you passed along the phone tree to resources that might be able to help.

Keep your chin up.  I'm really hoping that you find something that can help.

You should talk to strangers more often. Seriously. New York has the most interesting and diverse strangers you could possibly imagine and I've learned a lot and had a lot of pleasant experiences talking to strangers.
