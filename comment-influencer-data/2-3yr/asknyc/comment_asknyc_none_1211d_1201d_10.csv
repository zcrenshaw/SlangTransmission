Any question that suggests the city is very dangerous.
"Not a question, but the worst is when tourists just go to the busy touristy areas and then say stuff like ""New York is so crowded, I could never live here!"""
"I will *not* compromise on a crappy apartment with craigslist weirdos. I don't care if I have to shell out 15% of the yearly rent to get a nice apartment, but I simply won't go for a shitty place with d-bag roommates to save a few bucks. "
"* culture shock #1: most people will ignore you. its not personal. we ignore everyone. you kinda have to here. you'll understand why the first time you encounter one of the crazies. that should take all of 15 minutes or so once you're in the city. 
* culture shock #2: we're pretty friendly if you start a conversation when and where its appropriate. we're pretty unfriendly if you annoy us or interrupt us
* DONT STAND BLOCKING THE FUCKING STAIRS 
* culture shock #3: you will probably hear 5+ languages spoken every day. you will probably see 10+ written languages on a regular basis. everyone knows at least a little english though. 
* culture shock #4: we have 3 different Chinatowns in 3 different boroughs. The one in Queens has the best food though.
* culture shock #5: its shocking and appalling how much everything costs here. get used to it. 
* culture shock #6: the cops are not your friends. 
* SERIOUSLY GET OUT OF THE DAMN WAY YOUR BLOCKING THE SIDEWALK FUCK
* culture shock #7: graffiti is not a sign of cultural decay or a bad neighborhood. the most interesting places in the city are the ones with the most writing on the walls
* culture shock #8: driving is for suckers. learn how to use the subways."
"""I'm starting a new job on Monday, making $30k, is that enough to live in a place like I saw on Friends?"""
"""I hate the city, it's so crowded, how can you stand to live there?"" Fuck you, I don't rag on you for living in your shitty little town in the middle of nowhere."
Is this supposed to be a funny joke? Because it's too on the nose for this sub to find funny 
"My mom couldn't believe how ""neighborhoody"" astoria was when she came to visit me.  I think she thought we all live above the m&amp;m store.  "
"""What are the hidden gems/non-touristy things""?


Also, if you ever need directions or something, people are happy to help you. Just don't start with ""Excuse me, can you help me?"" Just straight into ""Do you know how to get to X"". "
"There is a service, called Access-a-ride, which gives you car service for the price of a subway fare if you are disabled. It's a somewhat lengthy process to get approved, so begin as soon as possible. 

While there are criticisms of the service, I suggest you apply for it so that it is an option you can use if you want to.

Last winter I broke my foot and was walking with a cane and slow on stairs for some time. Just give yourself a LOT more time than you think to get around, learn the buses as they are often quite useful,  and when possible avoid the most crowded touristy areas. "
"It's not about being in a rush. Every time I hear ""Excuse me, can you help me,"" I stop, ready to offer directions or something. Then, when I stop, and turn around, I get a whole life story about being stranded and needing a bus ticket, and that their son lives in some random town and they need to get there, and he was supposed to wire some money but it didn't come through, and she just wants to spend one night in a hostel because......


When it's not that, it's someone trying to sell something. 



It's not about not having 5 extra seconds. It's about not wanting to be caught up in a sob story or a promotion or whatever else. I get stopped, and 10:1 it's not directions. So if someone's clear about what they are asking for, and it's something I can help with, without having to give money, I'll be happy to help. "
"A few gems from people who have visited me:

* Doesn't anybody speak English here? 
* Don't you feel like you have no identity here? 
* What's a brownstone? Is that a brownstone? (points at random brown building). 
* Why don't people talk to each other?

And every time my mom visits: ""What's that building? Who lives there?""  I don't know, do I look like the fucking census bureau to you? "
Don't. They aren't legal bedrooms.
Someone never got around to telling their parents they dropped out.
"never refer to yourself as a ""good ole boy"" ..here, that's slang for racist white boy. "
Why not have the au pair take him when the butler is too busy?
"Alternatively, ""I'm starting a new job on Monday, making $100k, is that enough to get a room anywhere within the five boroughs?"""
(but sometimes I do)
"New Yorkers don't have the same level of Southern politeness, so this may come as a big shock. We're just honest and to the point most of the time.  So that goes both ways:  if someone is really nice and friendly to you, they really actually mean it and are not just being polite (edit: unless they are trying to get money from you or scam you in someway); but also, if you're being a jerk or in people's way, slowing down foot traffic, etc, people WILL let you know and no one will dance around the issue.

There are over 8 million people living in this city, and millions more who commute in every day, so in order for this city to run as smoothly as it does, everyone needs to be aware of other people and how you or what you're doing might be affecting others.  Pay attention and observe the etiquette on the sidewalks, subways, escalators, etc. 

Wear closed-toe shoes in the summer.

Don't be scared of the rats.

Avoid Times Square."
BroVi
"Now that the weather us getting nicer, it's the perfect opportunity for outdoor activities like sitting in Central Park and crying or panhandling in Times Square. You can also check out the Skint, Brokelyn, or Nerd York City for the hundreds of events they list a day."
"How old is your son? I've seen high school students use Uber by themselves, but I wouldn't put a little kid in it.  Better to send him with a babysitter.

Also, what is up with rich people problems on this sub lately? Lol.

Edit: If you give me that $34,000/year instead, I will escort him to school every day via subway, giving him the invaluable life experience of ""slumming it"" and seeing all of NYC's colorful characters and cultures, but under the protective wing of a safe (and white, with impeccable English) adult. No fancy shmancy uptown school gives that level of immersion education! PM me. (Don't worry, I'm white.)"
"Nothing is more family oriented than the Times Square Olive Garden.

You know; when you're there, you're family."
"""Do you have a second?"", ""Can I ask you a question?"", etc. are unfortunately all used by homeless people and people trying to sell you something. I would say 95% of New Yorkers will just keep walking without even noticing you if you lead with that and it's not because we don't want to help, but most of us are asked quite literally multiple times a day, and it's the easiest way to get through the day without getting harassed (not that all homeless people harrass, but some get real angry). 

The best way to approach it is ""Excuse me can you tell me how..."" in one fluid sentence and almost everyone will be willing to help. 

Anyway if you don't, that's admirable. You probably have more patience than me (or haven't lived here long enough to get jaded by it). "
"A Salt &amp; Battery 112 Greenwich Ave, New York, NY 10011
its a few blocks away from union square"
This is the worst thing I've ever read.
"Should have said ""What gay bars will be packed with Seaman for Fleet Week?"" "
"They think Brooklyn is a neighbourhood, like how Chinatown and New Jersey are neighbourhoods."
"Check out [The Bowery Boys](http://www.boweryboyshistory.com/)

Just go about your business. One reason celebrities live here is because most people don't bother them. 
"Just got this question last week from my wife's friend. ""We got a hotel on priceline for $100 per night. Should we book it?"" 

Wife says, ""where is it?""

Friend: ""somewhere in Brooklyn."" She didn't know anything else about the location.

Brooklyn is about the size AND population of Chicago. Where is kind of relevant."
"Dude seriously? It's the 4th time this week you've come here doing this. What are you even trying to gain?

Edit: lol OP just PM'd me ""wrong person idk what you're talking about"" because he thinks deleting his post makes him invisible.

Edit: he didn't even delete the post.

Edit: OP has sent me 4 PM's about how I have the wrong person and is now speaking in only emoji."
"All anecdotal, but despite our impatience with slow walkers and clueless tourists, I've seen nothing but patience for and deference to folks with disabilities in NYC. People will give up their seats on the subway, they'll be patient with you on the stairs (meaning they will definitely still try to squeeze past you, they just won't intentionally smack you with their Trader Joe's tote bag as they pass), and even lazy cab drivers will hop out and open doors for you. So no, you won't get eaten alive by the people.

The sheer amount of stairs involved in using the subway system, on the other hand, could be a real issue. I'd take a serious look at using the bus as your sole/primary means of transportation. It's often slower, but the time you spend waiting for the bus is better than time spent working your way up and down and around staircases underground."
"It's definitely not illegal, but better to take a photo of the actual taxi driver's license which should be displayed facing you on the partition behind the driver's seat."
