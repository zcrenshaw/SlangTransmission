Broker fees?
"&gt;Could this have been a scam?

Yes, of course. 

Worst case scenario however - you may have bought a bunch of cheap food for a liar. Not like she can go exchange it for much. 

You did something nice for someone telling you a sob story and pleading with you. Use a little more discretion when doing that in the future. You will encounter people like that almost every day that you leave the house.

Welcome to NYC. "
Availability to low-cost/free Mental Health facilities 
Trump's security.
"I live in Manhattan so... Any pizza place that charges $4 for a plain slice, Any coffee place that charges $5 for regular iced coffee, Any bodega that charges more than $3.50 for a BEC, Any bar that tries to get you to pay a cover charge, Equinox Gym Memberships, Baked by Melissa and most importantly mozzarella sticks... why do most places charge over $1 per stick?  "
"Egg and cheese on a roll, small coffee, Gatorade, bag of chips. Usually purchased at around 11:30am on a blindingly bright and loud Saturday morning."
Housing affordability. A lot of working-class folks are getting pushed out of the communities they've lived in for generations. It's wrong. 
"Pedicabs.  Cousin wanted to get one for an 11 block rider for 4 of us.  It was a per block per passenger rate, came out to about 180."
What the fuck is a friendly neighborhood?
"You can: 

Hang out closer to home.

Move closer to the EV.

Take the train halfway there.

Start dating someone in the EV, because everyone in NYC should experience a relationship of shallow convenience."
"#sonder n. *the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your ownâ€”populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness*


This is my favorite emotion and NYC is like mainlining this 24/7."
"Two Boots Pizza. I had some of their pizza before and hated it. Recently, tried it again at a meetup and it's still the worst pizza I've ever had... no matter the pricing. It tastes stale and old. I've had better pizza at hole in the wall places in NYC. Very overrated. "
"""Hi, I can place an ad on Streeteasy and run a credit report, now pay me 5k"""
Stand five wide on the sidewalk stopped while looking up at the buildings. That should be interesting.
"Museums, theaters, restaurants, coffee shops, large department stores, hotels lobbies... they all have restrooms, and reasonably clean ones. So like when you have lunch, go to a museum, go to the theater or whatever, you ALWAYS go before you leave, simple, then you aren't caught by surprise.  

Perhaps she is exceptionally picky about where she pees?

Does your wife have a medical condition that makes the need to go to the bathroom unexpected and/or urgent?"
Real estate prices/rent are way too fucking high. 
"You walk into the nearest bar and head straight to the restroom, which probably is in pretty decent shape.  You don't make eye contact with anyone on the way in there or on the way out."
"The reason she's fat is because she's poor - good food is expensive and McDonald's is cheap. She may or may not have lied about the details of her family, but that she was hungry and poor and wanted food, I have no doubt. I would not recommend repeating the experience, but you did a nice thing."
"I'd go to work. Possibly do laundry if I feel ambitious. More likely, lay on the couch and binge watch Netflix. If it's a really nice day like today, maybe sit outside and read a book.


NYC has a handful of decent restaurants. Maybe I'd grab dinner with friends."
Don't forget any food cart that charges more than $1 for a Poland spring 
"New York is a ""one-party consent"" state, which means that recording a conversation, in person or over the telephone, is legal as long as at least one of the parties involved in the conversation consents. So it would be illegal for me to record your conversation, but it is legal for you to record your conversation without the permission/knowledge of the other parties.

Grimaldi's - WAY overrated
Why would you want random strangers smiling or nodding to you? Doesn't it get tiring to do it all the time??
"Levain cookies are the best I've ever put in my mouth, I don't even care how much they cost."
"It's still nice man. Whether they needed the food or lied to you, you filled someone's tummy"
"There's a cab line. It's incredibly easy to find. By following signs for ""Taxi"" and looking for the huge line of taxis. There's a guy at the front directing you to a cab and answering questions. It's a flat rate to Manhattan. 

Never, EVER accept a ride from a person waiting inside the terminal. "
Katz is expensive but good. You can buy 3lbs of their pastrami for like $60 and make your own sammiches at home. Get the rye from moishes. 
You're 100% imagining this lol. They probably were wondering why the fuck you were looking at them. Or thought you needed help/directions or something.
"Roast beef hero with pepper jack, lettuce, pickles, grilled onions (if it has a grill), banana peppers, jalapenos, Russian dressing. 

That should be just at or under $7. Any extra goes to an Arizona tall boy.  


"
"I don't understand what that means. My grandma's 97 and has no problem finding places to pee in the city. 

Are you saying she's fussy or rigid and won't change her behaviors or opinions? Well there's your issue, not her age."
"As others have said, you can't really turn hamburgers into money readily. Might be some kind of lie/exaggeration involved but somebody is getting fed."
"This is pretty much the best question ever asked here.

I go with $7 worth of meat from a hot bar."
"Generally, we don't convince people to move here. We have plenty of people already. If you want to, and feel like you should, then do. If you don't want to, then don't. Your call. 

You have some savings, some friends, and a job lined up you can start immediately. You're about 1000% ahead of the average person who asks this question here."
Juliana's is now what Grimaldi's once was.
"Not locked up. They're not criminals or wild animals.

But an inpatient/outpatient care system similar to the NHS. It should be an system that comes with therapy, counseling, prescriptions. 

We know mental health gets overlooked a lot in America. But even more so in NYC. 

I don't even know if we have a system here at all that helps with low cost services. A lot of my college friends got ""free"" mental health from their schools and were dumped like bricks after graduation. Some of them aren't doing to great right now. "
I wish I had problems like this.
"Chicken cutlet on a toasted hero. cheddar cheese, tomatoes, mayo, light mustard. "
"I'm in Central Park daily, see some with signs on them that say $3.99 per minute per passenger.  Anyone who goes for that deserves to be ripped off!"
"We have a very low vacancy rate in NYC. We don't have unused space to fill.

AirBNB isn't causing a housing shortage - we already have one, basically all the time - and the fact that people can have leases on two apartments and make a profit on one is definitely hurting the number of units available for people to actually live in."
I don't mean to sound insensitive but you have to move. Any civil/legal remedy will not resolve this issue within a decent timeframe nor is there any guarantee you'll get the results you want.

"No, you basically have to respect your neighbors. Go introduce yourself and ask them if there any times they are not cool with you playing. Just be a good neighbor, and everything will be ok. You have rights to use your apartment to play your music within reasonable hours, but they have a right to not have their lives disturbed, as well."
"I'd like to see new businesses skirting tax laws (like AirBNB) forced to pay hefty taxes to help fix the problems they make worse (in this example, housing shortages)."
"I ate artichoke sober once, not so great. "
If you're happy with your apartment then there's no such thing as being too frugal.
"I just ignore it. It's crowded; it happens. I also definitely do not expect an ""excuse me"" or ""I'm sorry"" from every little bump or nudge. That's insane. "

You live in a fucking city.

Probably one of the best LPT out there. "
