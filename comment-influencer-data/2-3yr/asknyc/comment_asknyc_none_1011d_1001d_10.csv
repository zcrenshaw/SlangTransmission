"One hack that some of my friends have perfected is being born into a wealthy family. They don't have to pay rent with their own money, they can take exciting risks with their education and career because they have a golden parachute and massive safety net, and the second home in East Hampton is almost always available for fun trips out of the city. Even better, they always front the money for dinners and drinks on their parents' credit card, and then generously let you pay them back for it on Venmo. It's like getting paid twice!

Edit: Whoa, my first-ever ""controversial"" tag. I didn't mean to offend anyone."
"Always bars, just walk right in and make no eye contact. Bonus: they have beer."
"- Hotels are great places to pee and/or have a quiet phone call. The ballrooms are often unlocked and either on the 2nd floor or in the basement. Walk like you know where you're going, and it's unlikely anyone will bother you.

- Exit Strategy is an app that has shaved off seconds, if not full minutes, of my subway travel.

- NOSE: North side of streets are the odd numbers, south side are evens. (For the most part, in most of Manhattan.)"

"Always pee when you stop for lunch, or any time you visit a museum pee before you leave. When you're out and about: hotel lobbies, Starbucks, Barnes &amp; Nobles, Whole Foods, Penn station..."
Only works if you are of a demographic that gets the benefit of the doubt.
"All light poles in Central Park have a metal plate with a four digit number stamped into them. The first two of these numbers are the number of the street the pole is on a line with if you were to walk directly out of the park to the nearest street corner. So if the pole has a plate that says 8634, you are at 86th street inside the park."
"If travelling Amtrak from Penn Station, check the arrivals board for your train, not departures. See what track it is arriving on and go down to that track as soon as it arrives and people have gotten off. You will beat the rush of people who are looking at the departure board waiting for the ""Boarding now"" announcement."
"&gt;Why does NYC [have] very few public toilets?

At least someone should attempt an answer to this question.

Around 1991, the city awarded a contract to the French company JC Decaux to install public restrooms around town.  A lawsuit was filed claiming the proposed design would infringe on the rights of the disabled.

Regardless of the merits of that suit, it's 25 years later and we still have nothing."
"I transferred to a university in the city after going to a school in Ithaca (a textbook college town with a very traditional college experience). So I completely understand your quesiton about the ""normal college experience"" thing. And well, no you can't have a normal college experience in the city, but it may not be a bad thing.

In a normal college town, you have a small community that is dedicated to pushing you along as a college student. You are granted a bit more leeway than you would be in the rest of the world. Things are more laid back and casual. You are seen as a work in progress and the community treats you as someone still exploring who you are and where you want to go. College parties where you get drunk and hook up in a dorm room are common. 

But in the city, you are thrust into the real world. Unless you have wealthy parents, you're going to have to find a job and learn to balance studying, socializing, and working. And the people in the city are less patient if you don't have the same drive as the people around you. But you also have all the resources of New York City at your disposal. If you know what you want to do and how to get there, its wonderful. Networking is an absolute breeze. Setting up informational interviews and connecting with top alumni is a wonderful advantage to being in NYC for your college days. Even off campus you can find networking events, organizations, and meetup groups for whatever you want to do with yourself. You literally have one of the greatest cities at your finger tips as you figure out how the hell to get where you are going. The college party scene isn't as big since theres a large number of commuting students, but you have more quality concerts and just general stuff to do that college towns don't.

So both experiences have their pros and cons. It really depends what you are looking for and how ready you are to work for it. I can tell you that at 18, I was not ready to seriously pursue a career and was still solidly in the rebellious teenage years. So do a lot of soul searching.

And for the other question, do you get used to city life? Probably. You may feel like you're constantly out of place and not keeping up with everyone else, but eventually you'll see some newcomer to the city and think damn, I've come a long way. Speaking of which, you may need a therapist if you move here. Just a heads up."
"Go to 230 5th Ave and see the skyline for free, or the Wyeth hotel, or the standard hotel, all have roof top bars.

Edit: wait are you telling me you used the sidebar, made your own itinerary, and did that shit without ever making a post here? You're dope yo."
"This is the right answer.  No eye contact, no hesitation, no shame."
"It's when a bunch of drunken idiots in Santa costumes roam in packs through the city and vomit Christmas cheer into the streets and unsuspecting or welcoming dive bars. Fistfights, crying girls, overall human misery the norm. Also known as the day NYC parents in the east village are forced to tell their children there is no such thing as Santa, lest their children believe St nick is ""crushing it hard, bro"" with that reindeer in between the village voice newspaper dispenser and the overflowing city trash can. "
"Honestly... 

Learn to not care that much about your apartment and learn to be able to relax outside of it. I have 4 roommates for a 2b apartment so its always cramped, and its always messy, and so I am typically fine with it being that way. I learned long ago to deal with pretty bad cramped living conditions. 

When I want to relax, I go to the park or I hang out on my stoop, or I go for a bike ride. I try and get cheap food and eat it around my neighborhood instead of ordering in, I like to walk around and listen to music. Go to friends places or just hang out with them on the streets. I try to see my apartment as more of a place to go to sleep in, and the city as my home. 

Why? Because chances are, 90% of us won't be able to find a comfortable apartment to live in. If you're living here, and you're not rich, you're probably gonna be living with roommates, many of whom are crazy people. Its never going to be suburbia comfort, but you will experience the best of urban excitement. In order to truly be comfortable in this city, you have to learn to be okay with being uncomfortable. This means walking tremendous distances to go to places, or taking disgusting crowded train rides, or living in a ridiculously cramped apartment. But if you REALLY want it, you can have it, its just these are the costs you gotta pay. "
"'cause you gotta take a boat to get there. 

And oh yeah, y'all vote Republican."
"* Maxdelivery does grocery delivery on demand in &lt;1hr, and their selection is almost as good as freshdirect.  
* Always take the A train (or LIRR) to JFK if it is around rush hour.  Driving is terrible at that time.  
* Juno seems just as readily available as Uber and they seem to perpetually be offering a significant fare discount.
* The Ramble inside central park really feels like you're in the middle of some actual woods.  It's about as ""removed"" from NYC as you can get without leaving.
* Sublets that lead to lease takeovers can get you into broker fee buildings often without paying the broker fee
* Do not go to the DMV without an appointment
* Dime Bank in Williamsburg has no fee, no strings attached bank accounts

"Always leave the bar when the room spins, never buy Coke on Broadway, pedi cabs are a rip off, but are HILARIOUS when you're drunk."
"Because people will pay for it.

If I am ever near midtown and don't want to carry my stuff around I just check it at the baggage/coat check in the basement of Macy's.
That's my trademark
"Well, as a Black man who worked at a hotel as a overnight auditor/front desk agent in midtown Manhattan for a year and a half, I can tell you that my white Manager and assistant manager never question any of the well dressed white folks (or people who looked white) who'd walk in to the hotel. Black folks who didn't look super put together and familiar got the ""can I help you, sir/ma'am"" from staff, especially certain staff members. I gave everyone the benefit of the doubt, but kept a close eye on them via the CCTVs if they didn't acknowledge the staff and looked familiar.

Also, I'm not sure you comprehended my earlier comment."
Lol wut?! They rang the bell so you had no choice?! You must not be from 'round here...
Learn to eat cheap and walk a lot. It will save you a ton of money and keep you fit. 
"on one of the biggest party nights of the year, you cannot be mad at neighbors for taking the cheap route to enjoy themselves."

"If you need to pee and can't find a hotel lobby (and are male), kneel near a truck on a side street as if you're tying your shoes. 

If you want to discreetly finger someone, rent a rowboat in Central Park, there's a private-ish spot under one of the bridges. "
Just go to any bar below 14th street and talk then watch as the women flock. Accent having motherfuckers.
"There is an unlimited quantity of cold air available for free. You just have to let it in. Won't help with the dryness as its also dry outside. 

If you're getting bloody noses that often you might want to get that dealt with medically though."
