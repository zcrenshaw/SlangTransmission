"You talked to idiots then. The subway is easy to navigate, and if you have any doubts ask anybody on the train or the platforms, for the most part we are very helpful. "
Millions of women ride the subway every day. Its perfectly safe.
"Yep, the only thing you really need to know is WHERE you're going, as in your final stop. 

Once you're inside just about anyone can help you get where you're going, navigate transfers, etc. 

Illiterate people who don't speak English take the subway."
This isn't a question but it's still better than %80 of posts in this sub.
everything changes. i'm glad ny is constantly changing. that's what's awesome about it. hanging on to a nostalgic past is a recipe for unhappiness. 
Better than living by Subway.  That fucking smell is disgusting.
"No. Eww. Jesus. What the hell is wrong with you people from the west coast? (Present, sane company excluded, /u/Spurned_Liver.)"
"If you've never been on public transportation ever before, you have a ton of extra money to blow, and you're totally incapable of reading maps or following directions, they might be right.

Lots of people have troubles with it their first few times, but it's really not that hard. Use Google Maps and you will get directions. If you can follow GPS directions while driving, you should be capable of following them on the subway."
They are trying to gain entry into your building without being identified because they know you probably won't buzz them in. 
"Whatever it is, take it off if you're in a crowded subway and hold it at your sides / in front of you / on the floor / in your lap / but not on your back."
"When you start looking at job postings for the city, you're done for."
"if you've got masochistic tendencies, you could try asking a question in /r/asknyc."
"*must resist, can't resist*  You're about a 15-minute walk [from the Olive Garden, where they'll treat you like family](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/wiki/food#wiki_nyc.27s_best_cuisines)."
"This is probably not what you want to hear, but you just get used to it. They really don't make anything that can cover up the sound of a passing train, that's both removable or affordable. You can try a white noise machine to help, but it's really a matter of getting accustomed to it."
"I've made several reports. Every one of them the cab driver has just pled guilty after TLC called me and asked a few questions, and I didn't have to get involved further than that. 

Also, they typically (almost always, if not always) give the complaining witness the option to testify by phone."
Blasphemy. I've ended friendships for less.
"No matter what era you grew up in, you will always miss how everything was when you were younger."
"There are literally like 6 pidgeys flying in my apartment as a type + I caught a Venonat that was juss' chillin' on my GF's shoulder.

10 year old me is crying with joy on the inside."
"The number of Zubats and Rattatas is *too damn high*!

Luckily my desk at work is in range of a couple of pokestops that I can just keep spamming all day..."
"Take the PATH to the World Trade Center. Walk to Fulton Street Station. Take the 4 5 to 86th Street. 

Edit: When you get to Fulton Street Station, follow the signs with green circles that say ""4"" or ""5"" inside of them. Go to the side that says ""Uptown"" or ""Bronx."" Get on any train that says ""4"" or ""5"" on it. "
"Do you know what my jammed pack, exciting week consisted of?  Work, commuting, laundry, grocery shopping, and looking for this stupid plastic piece at Bed, Bath and Beyond to fix something in the bathroom."
"Here's the thing why they suck. They work a sales job, no base salary, extremely competitive environment, and work on commissions/agents fee... And all of them at one point in time has been royally screwed by either the buyer/seller/landlords/brokers. 
So they are very bitter, pessimistic, competitive humans in the most stressful city.

Once you get to the top tiers of real estate you'll see nicer more accommodating agents. But these people came from wealth, high value networks, or this is a side gig for them while a well off partner supports them.

There are 30k agents in this city and I bet all of them would or have throw others under the bus for a sale.  "
"&gt; income disparity and the ability for poor people to live in this city is important.

Poor people moved to the NYC area because it was shitty back in the 1970s &amp; 1980s. I know that's why my parents immigrated here - rent was cheap and low-end jobs were plentiful. It was not that the city's government prioritized cheaper housing or jobs. It was just that the people who could afford to leave when it went to shit did, and it left a vacuum for others to come in.

Economics ebb and flow. While a city can certainly take steps to ensure that there are opportunities available for all levels of socioeconomic groups, the ultimate goal of a city is to be successful and profitable. You can't look back with nostalgia at the ""affordability"" of NYC without realizing the reason it was affordable was because it was terrible."
Cab.
"Treat him to some Olive Garden where they treat you like family. While he's full and tired, kill him and wear his skin."
"The city would literally not function.  Period.  The subway is the reason New York is able to maintain its level of density, and if you took away the subway you would have a complete transportation breakdown.  It would go WAY beyond more drivers and higher parking prices.  People would just simply not be able to get where they need to go. If you've ever tried to get around the upper east side when the 456 goes down, just imagine that, but across the entire city.  It would be apocalyptic."
"If you're open to seeing a minor league game. - I'd see a Coney Island Cyclones game instead of Staten Island..... because then you're in Coney Island, which is awesome - instead of SI, which is not so awesome. Just my 2 cents."
"&gt;rent on an hourly basis

&gt;not shady

These are not compatible terms."
"Unfortunately you were hypnotized. Whenever you hear the trigger word/sound, you will automatically react. Good luck."
"I had a cabbie pull a gun on my mother and I when I was a kid. She went in to court to testify against him and he ended up going to jail. If he was on drugs, he's unlikely to remember where you guys got dropped off. He also gave the same treatment to multiple people, and probably won't be able to figure out who filed the complaint. I would go ahead and try to get this guy off the road."
"There were these two identical modernist towers in lower Manhattan . Some people (a lot actually) said they were ugly, but I liked 'em. 

"
"Make the effort to seek out events where you live now. Yes, we have more density here, but many people make little effort to take advantage of the events and culture surrounding their own towns/states. You'd be surprised at the local art and music communities you've lived alongside for years without realizing they exist."
"How should I get in touch with you, in the event the sink explodes?"
"I just take my private one, don't know about the more plebe ones."
Fuck no. Ranch is gross in any context.
"Nearly 35 years in NYC now. NYC was rough in the 80s, but full of character. The 90s was a good time, the economy was good, and everyone had some level of success. The 00s started rough, and many left the city. Now that we're in the 10s, we are finally recovering again, but a lot have already left, and cannot, or choose not, to return.

NYC is a living organism, always evolving. The best thing about it - regardless of how NYC changes, it always remains the best city in the world.
