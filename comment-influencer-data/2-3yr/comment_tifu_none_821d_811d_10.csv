"Locksmith here. What you did is release the wafer that holds the cylinder plug in. If you have the plug in your hand, you'll see the last wafer at the back. That's the one that holds the plug in. Line up the back of the plug shape to the inside of the housing in the file cabinet and push it in until it stops. You'll have just the face of the plug sticking out. Stick your pick to the back of the plug and push that last wafer down while you gently push on the face of the plug and it'll pop back in. It might take a bit for your first try. So be patient.

Those pop out really easy for us when we need to make keys or rekey them. And they usually pop back in just as quick.

"TIFU by thinking that a giant two bodied floating monster  was just some debris I could chill on in a lake.

So as a snake I usually hang out in a quiet sunny spot while the sun is shining, but otherwise I explore dark secluded undergrowth and holes for rodents and other easy meals, but Yesterday after getting all warmed up in the sun I thought I would go for a swim. Don't get me wrong, I'm a good swimmer and I usually love swimming, but I feel kind of vulnerable especially when I'm swimming on the surface and all that darkness is under me. It really gives me the creeps when I start imagining what might be under there coming up towards me.

Anyway, I saw this big piece of debris like a tree branch or something floating on the water and it looked like a great place to chill and have a look around. There might be some little animals trapped on it or whatever. So I'm booking it across the water to get to this thing when all of a sudden a giant monkey looking thing jumps straight at me! I thought I was done for, but after landing on me, this things makes this high pitched screech at me before swimming away. Yeah, needless to say I practically flew back to the shore and I doubt I'll be going swimming any time soon."

I was squeezing off a rag at work to wipe off a table and I accidently splashed some old guy eating it was only like one drop I thought he looked pissed but then I realized he didn't even notice and the look on his face was just an old man look

"&gt; bit of a techie person

You could say that. In college and graduate school I used arpanet, and had a fingernail in telnet (as in, I found some minor bug that I reported and it got fixed).

My first job out of college was sort of unusual, in that I was literally hired to become an expert in image compression. Our purpose was developing realtime data links that could be used with remotely piloted vehicles, and indeed we held a number of patents in related areas (company owned them actually). So I literally had a hand in drone development, and I was a member of the Joint Photographics Expert Group - you may have heard of some of their work, nowadays called jpeg files.

I gave up finding better ways to find people to kill and went into medical imaging instead, where I am still today. Mostly I write software.

Cool part was sitting at my desk that faced the airport, and watching the fighters we made take off.

Sorry you asked, right?"

"Also be aware there are redditors out there who have and do take advantage of especially young people in precarious situations. You are priming yourself to have someone offer to ""let you live with them"", and there are several instances of that turning EXTREMELY predatory in the short term. People have been blackmailed, people have gone in on apartment leases with BATSHIT CRAZY people, and people have been physically assaulted by other ""helpful"" redditors who recognize opportunities to grift off other people.

Be extremely wary about people who offer to ""help you out"" by moving in with you to help with rent, who offer to let YOU move in with THEM etc. Trust people you've known for a long time - you just told the internet that you are about to be an exceptionally vulnerable person, and that can pull the dregs of society from the wood work.

"Cylinder locks have pins that align when you put in the key.  I can't tell from your blurry pictures, but probably (as you dont have the key) some of the pins are sticking out.

You need to go back to the lock and jiggle it with your picks some more.  With luck, you'll jiggle just like you did earlier and get those pins lined up again and can push it back in.  Be gentle, and always have a light pressure on the lock in the direction you want it to go.  The idea here is that you won't get lucky enough to get all pins lined up at once, but at any given time, there is likely only one pin holding up progress.  If you get lucky and get that pin into place, it'll make incremental progress to where you need to go.

Will OP die? Is OP's dad a reddit lurker? Will it just work out? Exactly what else is in the safe? This is a good'n
"Hey OP, older person here who had a father like yours, but worse.

I see a number of posts recommending you blackmail your father, or threaten him with blackmail.  Please don't do this.  It's idiotic for any number of reasons, not least of which is that you blow all your ammo on a threat and make a hateful person even more dangerous by catching him on the back foot.  This is insanity while you're still living in his house.

However, that said, you would be very well advised to take pictures of everything in that cabinet (along with the cabinet and room itself, try to include something with the date in your photos too, like a wall calendar or today's paper) and store them outside the house.  In multiple places (cloud, thumb drive with a friend, etc.)  And then you SIT on them.  You say nothing, you do nothing, you do not act on them in any way.  If at all possible you do not let any other person IRL know that the photos even exist.

You do this for insurance: if he gets violent with you, if he withdraws promised funding, if he makes your life unsafe.  And then you release them as you see fit, in the way you think is best, to the people who will laugh the loudest and shame him the hardest.  BUT NOT WHILE YOU LIVE IN HIS HOUSE.

So don't bother with blackmail, and don't ever threaten.  A man who threatens is acting out of his own insecurity.  Threats tell real enemies not to take you seriously, because if you actually had the will to use your weapons you would.  Threats just tell your enemies you don't have the balls.

So don't threaten.  Just sit on them.  And then when you use them, USE them, but not before you are out of his house.  All you have to do is simply put them online somewhere and direct others to the site as you please.  He should be the very LAST person to know you have done so.

If you don't think you have the discipline for this, then don't take the pictures.  **But above all else don't threaten or blackmail.**  It's the very worst thing you could ever do for your own wellbeing.  

Best wishes for your future -- and good luck with the locks!!!

EDITED TO ADD:  I think there is a misunderstanding sometimes that men like OP’s dad can actually be successfully deterred from using his physical/financial/familial power to make OP’s life a living hell, and that threats or blackmail on OP's part could possibly accomplish that.  NO.  It just doesn’t work that way in real life.  OP’s dad is going to hatefully carry on toward OP exactly as he has always done, until he is forced to stop abusing by powers **outside his control** (OP leaving, ill-health, jail, hospitalization, divorce, death).  

OP can’t change him, nor can OP threaten or blackmail his own way to safety.  Many have tried: it only ever blows up on the person trying it.  The ONLY solution to this is for OP to leave, which OP already plans to do.  In the meantime he needs to keep his head down until he can get out and even that might not be enough to keep him safe.  But blackmail/threats won’t stop his father from doing a damn thing.  If anything, they will only escalate the problem.  "
"Wow.  Sorry that happened to ya. But trust me, it's not the worst thing that could happen during sex.  Just read my name."
"/u/onearmedtwit has the right of it. However there's detail missing based on information elsewhere in the thread.

Looking at your picture it seems like you have a bare lock cylinder rather than a core. Frankly, I'm surprised you didn't spill the wafers.

Elsewhere in the thread it sounds like you can't get the cylinder all the way back in and now the cabinet is locked. There's two possibilities here and it's likely a combination of the two:

A) You're not knocking down the last wafer that keeps the lock in place.

B) The tail piece of the wafer lock is not aligning with the mechanism inside the cabinet. 

B) requires some more explanation. See the back of the cylinder? That needs to align with something inside the cabinet. Get a flashlight, look in there and get that mechanism aligned in the unlocked position, clockwise or counterclockwise, whichever way it turns. My guess is that you need to turn the mechanism inside the cabinet about 60 degrees counterclockwise and insert the cylinder with the top of the wafers horizontal to the left.

Putting it back in you don't need to pick since you have the cylinder out: simply knock the wafers down from back to front as you slide it in. The inside walls will keep the wafers down for you until you turn it back to the locked position. 

EDIT: DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES TURN THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER PAST THE BOTTOM OF THE HOLE IN THE CABINET, UNLESS THAT'S THE LOCKED POSITION AND YOU KNOW IT. I CAN'T TELL FROM YOUR PICTURE BUT SOME CHEAP LOCKS HAVE A GAP AT THE BOTTOM WHICH WILL CAUSE YOU ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS YOU DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW.
