"Or pop a coin in his coinslot every time you see it. That's not a euphemism, get a roll of pennies and do this. If shame won't work, cold pennies in his asscrack might do the trick."
"Well, that, or she is just not attracted to him. I've known a few people stick together and sexless for years because it's more convenient than splitting up."
"Dude I am with you. I hate dancing too. And you absolutely do not have to compromise on something so stupid like this - you hate it with every fiber of your being, and she thinks it's a fun activity. So she can go do it with friends and leave you the hell out of it. Of course if that's a deal-breaker for her she can break up with you, but it boggles my mind why it *would* be. 

I'm having trouble expressing my thoughts on this thread because I think everyone is being ridiculous. Like, the physical reaction you have is very similar to that liquid ice feeling of deep terror. So what if you had a phobia of spiders instead? Are you then obligated to have tea parties with your girlfriend's pet tarantula because she thinks it's fun, regardless of you presumably wishing for the sweet embrace of death???? I just don't get it. My partner doesn't force me to dance, because he knows I fucking hate it. We have an entire life that barely even involves dancing, and I imagine yours is similar!!! 

You don't have to dance. If your girlfriend can't understand, and won't allow you to just support her from the sidelines, then you guys are probably done. However little sense the entire (non-)issue makes. "

To be honest I hope your girlfriend breaks up with you if you still at this point can't understand why it's inappropriate for her sister to live with you for so long. 
"I had a knit too that's entirely see through. I wear it with a bralette that is lace but still covers me. The outfit is intended to be worn this way. Am I showing skin? Yes. But I like it. I like the way it looks, and feels, I like the way I relate to myself when I wear this thing.

My fianc√© was uncomfortable for those same reasons, ""well I don't want men looking at you. I don't think this is how you should dress.""

I hear him. And we sat down and talked about it. I was unwilling to compromise because it's my body. When I agreed to this relationship I agreed to always hear him, to listen, to be honest about how I felt. To be committed to him. I don't believe be wearing a knit top is breaking that promise. I told him that he would have to accept this thing. It does not mean we love or respect each other any less.

This is a situation about a persons body and how they relate to it. Not about those drunk boys. Not about any other person but the one wearing whatever they want to wear."
"This. So much this.  
  
It's only been two months, and she's shown that she's doing what she can. Pregnancy is so physically exhausting, not to mention mentally, that she really is doing her best from the sound of it.  
  
Please give her a chance if you can afford it. People keep saying ""she'll find somewhere"" but she probably won't. Nobody likes to think that sometimes your situation is just screwed. George is a dick for not helping her somewhat while she carries his baby.   
   
Maybe sit down and make a plan with her? Like a realistic timeline of when she'll be able to work again? Maybe keep accepting 50e a month from her? Just whatever she can do."
"I'm old too and I don't have a 'one who got away' feeling. I have an ex that I loved, sure, but he's not my one who got away. He's the guy I had a relationship with which failed. When I examine it in the cold light of day I know we would never have been happy together.  Then I was fortunate enough to meet my husband who is the love of my life. Maybe I'm a cold fish or something but I honestly can't remember the last time I thought about my ex. When I found out he was married I can't say I cared that much, but I truly did love him at the time we were together. 

I think the behaviour of your friend, sobbing over a 23 year old relationship, is a worrying one. It's putting a relationship on on a romantic pedestal when it wouldn't have worked in reality. 

I can understand why people are cautioning OP that she might find him leaving her for someone else, because its the sort of thinking that opens relationships up to affairs. He's ignoring the real love he has with her for some romantic fantasy image of another woman. Pining over 'the one who got away' is a feeling you can choose to nurture if you so wish and it's a very unhealthy behaviour. 

If I was OP I couldn't settle for this situation either. "
"i'm sorry, i didn't realize moving a distance *that she commutes daily for work* is her stealing the child away and preventing the father from accessing him. if she can drive it twice a day, he can too, or they can meet halfway to cut the commute time in half. she doesn't have to be trapped where he lives when she doesn't work there."
So he's not even trying to pretend he isn't abusive. Why are you okay with putting up with this? Serious question.
"Your wife is in the right here.

You're being selfish. Many people would say games are a pointless exercise and waste of time."
"Thank you both for the compliments and reassurance. There is so much guilt associated with this situation and it is definitely my aim to be as respectful as possible. 

We do quite a bit together already as we have very similar interests. We live on the water and both like to sail, fish, kayak etc. She wanted to build a skiff (a small boat) herself so we've been working on that together for a few months now. 

We're going to Costa Rica together in October for a week. She's been writing a novel set in Central America and wants to go there for inspiration. Her mother gave her a trip for two as a gift. I suggested she bring her best female friend (who takes better care of her than even I do. She has intuition and understanding that is mind blowing) but her friend refused insisting I go instead and she can stay to watch all our kids. 

I thought about taking her out for something romantic while we're there but I don't want to hinder her writing or risk upsetting her. I have hoped that something would happen naturally during that week but I won't do anything overt. 


"
"Okay, point is you crushed on her then, you crushed on her now, and she has blocked you. It literally *doesn't fucking matter.* Even if you were super besties back then, which you clearly were not, she felt the need to block you in 2017. Leave. Her. Alone."
"You are at least self aware enough to realize this is a ""you"" problem and not a ""her"" problem.  You need to figure out a way to let this go or it will poison your relationship with resentment.  As you said, her mom is her best friend.  If her best friend wasn't her mom, would you care if she joined on the spa day?

If you feel neglected, then you should say so, but otherwise, keep it to yourself and try to get you head right about it."
"You chose to cheat, nothing got the better of you. Own your choices. Now you have to choose to tell her. She deserves to know and will find out eventually."
"I don't see what the fuss is.
You &amp; your wife sooner will learn to pick your battles.  

How to address it? Advise your wife to either comment nicely on Facebook;   
*""Happy birthday, Aunt _insert name_. Have a fun trip!*
*Sounds fun!! Safe travels &amp; happy birthday to _insert name!""*

Or say nothing at all. "
"You're being super selfish. 
They were a package deal. 
If you aren't ready to be a parent and help her and one of your comments you said you didn't like her wanting to call you dad. 
Like I'm sorry, but how in the hell did you think this was gonna work? 
Get out now. 
For their sake and yours.  "
"I actually like ""a huge"" as a standalone thing. ""Oh, man, I filled that form out three times and then my computer crashed, it was a huge!"" "
"I hate engagement rings and don't have one or a wedding ring. I think. He is being ridiculous. He is not communicating. He is whining instead and he is never going to stop complaining about it. Instead of finding some balance to your beliefs he is just flopping around and having tantrums.

You are pushing this relationship ahead. He is not pushing with you. He's along for the ride but willing to get off when he is tired of it."
"Immediately go no contact.  They didn't respect your wishes, so now they have to have consequences for disrespecting your boundaries.

Block them on everything.  Do not see them again and spend your weekend with your boyfriend celebrating your accomplishments.

And never invite them to another special event."
"If you look around this sub at all you'll see that it does matter. It doesn't ALWAYS matter, but it's a tell-tale sign of an unbalanced relationship. I'm 5 years younger than him and the thought of any of my friends dating a teenager is mind-boggling. There is almost always a reason that someone would prefer to date someone a decade younger than them, whether it be that they are emotionally immature and need a partner who won't notice that, or they need a partner who is naive and can be controlled, or people their own age can see these red flags and won't tolerate them like a teenager will. A 60 year old dating a 70 year old isn't a major deal, but seriously a 19 year old dating a 29 year old? I PROMISE you, in 10 years you will know what I mean"
"I'm sorry to say they stole the money. It's gone.   
They didn't save it for you. They appropriated it and spent it and it hasn't been around in a long time.  

You're going to have to simply move on from it. Absolutely judge your parents harshly for their actions. This will surely affect your relationship with them. But give up on the money. It's not there."
"No, tell your mother privately. Ask her to keep exactly how she found out from your father, if you like. It's important that she knows. It's also possible she knows and is fine with it, which you won't know if you never say anything. Alternatively, their marriage doesn't sound super great, and it might be a good thing if the marriage ends."
You seem to be full of excuses for upsetting him. There is something really off about this whole situation and how you are justifying your actions. It is really important that you get into counselling to work on your issues.
Anger. Name calling. Manipulation (Oh Ill leave since thats what youuuu want). Ewww. You dont want to invest more emotions into this where leaving gets realll hard.
I ask because you are a bit younger than him &amp; he sounds like he's treating your veganism like a teen phase that you need to grow out of. I wondered if it was just with diet or if he treated other decisions you make like impulsive young-person things you'll grow out of. (Even though you seem to handle things maturely.)
"All of that literally doesn't matter. It's just pure desperation and you grasping at straws. How do I know this? Because we've all been in your shoes at your age before.

She does not want to be in a relationship with you anymore. That's the end game. That's all the closure you're going to get. Keep repeating that until it sinks in. You shouldn't have to try and convince or persuade someone to want to be with you. Salvage your dignity, dude. "
"He doesn't distinguish values between flowers, so he is happy getting the cheapest ones. He does see value in different wines so he buys the good ones. In his mind these are the same thing. 

If you want more expensive flowers, you need to talk to him about how more expensive flowers are better than the cheaper ones and why you want them. "
"&gt;explain to her that the cons out weigh the pros when it comes to her declining an evening out with your circle.

Lol, you can't decide someone else's pros and cons. Clearly this is not the case for her.

Where's OPs compromise where he plans activities she can participate in or starts hanging out with people who won't refuse to do cheaper activities? What about her friends?

The whole tone of your comment suggests that she has no choice but to submit because he has more money and therefore the upper hand and it kinda squicked me out :("
"I don't think that it's always because they think their time is more valuable- my mom is a chronically late person, and I'm convinced it's just because she lives in a fantasy land. She was a stay at home mom who never went back to work after we all grew up. She doesn't have any sense of time and she rarely has repercussions for this, because she just reads and tends her chickens all day. Thankfully my dad is a very patient man and has honed his techniques for forcing her out the door for really important things, but he does pick his battles. All this to say... sometimes people are just clueless."
"You're her emotional boyfriend and that's all you're ever gonna be. You're almost too old for this shit. Even if she does eventually leave her husband, she won't settle down with you because you're associated with her emotional cheating. She'll want a ""fresh start"" free from history.

Your life, your call. Stick around as long as you want."
"I would find this very frustrating. 

Why do you expect your wife to wait for you when you don't keep your commitment to her and others (about when you will arrive)? Also, being late is rude. When you make your wife late you make her rude which is embarrassing for her. (I had this issue with my mother as a teenager.) You are asking your wife to be disrespectful and show up somewhere late in what . . . solidarity for your disrespect to her in your late arrival time?

You say you would wait for your wife if she was late. But is she late as often as you? "
"I really do not understand why everyone is giving you so much shit. There seems to be quite a lack of reading comprehension among a lot of these folks. With the edit in your post, it seems to me that she is being pretty controlling/insecure. Does she really have a very solid understanding of what your job is? Could it be possible that she is uncomfortable with the idea of you going to people's homes for some reason? If she was not like this before the baby though, I would say it probably has a lot do with the change in hormones."
"Okay I would just like to get this straight: 
- You were out partying with your boyfriend.
- He said he felt unwell and therefore sent you home in a cap? 
- He made it sound like he was heading home too, just separately? 
- you get a message with a picture of him out partying. You contact him and he says he is home? 
- you confront him with your evidence and he admits to being partying. 

If I got this right it sounds to me like he sent you home because he wanted to party on his own. I don't know why this is, could be because he wanted to hang out without you or because he wanted the thrill of cheating. No matter what his behavior is fishy. "
"I would say that my girlfriend definitely struggles to entertain herself. Her whole family are constantly running around like maniacs and asking each other to do things together. Like her mom will go grocery shopping and call my girlfriend to come with her...like three times a week. I don't mean to sound like I am bashing them, as they all seem to love the constant go go go, but I'm always shocked how much they all seem to ""need"" each other. Maybe this is what makes me feel kind of broken sometimes. I feel like I don't really need anyone. If my son is gone to a friends house for a night or two I do miss the hell out of him but it's not like I can't function by myself for days at a time. "
"I guess I don't really understand why you feel responsible for it after how she acted. Yes, you have her spare keys. But what would she have done if she had locked herself out while you were on vacation or whatever other reason? She's upset and being immature about it. "
"I don't mean this in a mean way, but I really think some people just don't fit together.
If your lifestyles are total opposites (she wants to go out as much as possible, you want to stay home as much as possible), and it doesn't seem like either one of you is going to change in the near future, I honestly think you guys might do yourself a favour and just find other people who you can be more ""yourself"" with, without constraint.

I do know not all is black and white though, people can change. Best of luck in whatever you decide to do, and also obviously you're not weird, you're just surrounded by polar opposites apparently. There's lots of people like you out there!"
"Your friends have a point.  Your husband behaves the way he does when you ""correct"" him not *just* because he feels bad about himself, but also to make you feel guilty for bringing up his short-comings.  It seems like it's working and that you feel guilty.  

If this was my husband, I would respond with ""Playing the woe-is-me card isn't doing anyone any good right now and you need to stop.  I support you, I want your life to improve, and am simply asking for you to manage your time and tasks in a better manner.  I have faith that with the tiniest bit of effort, you can do it!"".

EDIT: typo"
"&gt;I suggested that she does this the next week when my exams are finished, but she thinks it fine and said me and her can celebrate her birthday alone next week when I am be finished my finals exams.

I think this is a perfectly reasonable solution.  She has already made plans with her friends.  You're basically asking her to reschedule everything around you.  She's not being weird."
"Uh huh, sure.  Why did he wait so long then?  Why not send her a message right after you two got together saying he met someone and wouldn't be ""seeing"" her anymore?  You even referred to her as his ""ex.""  I've dated quite a few people in my life and I don't refer to them as ""exes"" unless we were actually in a relationship."
"""What do you think of my boyfriend?""

""I don't.""

""Do you like him""

""I'm not going to talk about him.""

""What are your opinions about him?""

""I don't appreciate it when you tell him what I say. You're free to tell him everything, but I'm going to stop telling you things because I'm not comfortable with this situation.""



I think brutal honesty is the way to go. "
I wasn't aware one could classify name-calling as a food/finance issue. 
"i saw the title and HAD to click on it. i feel you on a- whole-nother level. 
i don't necessarily resent them and get annoyed with them, i OVERLY worship them. and since i see them as such great people i feel insecure and like i'm not good enough for them.
when i'm single, i am incredibly happy with myself and i'm extremely confident and i'm a completely different person.
when i'm in a relationship, like i am now, i still love myself, but i just feel a lot smaller and less important. 
my boyfriend is extremely sweet to me and everything, it's not like he belittles me. i just for some reason feel insecure and super jealous. 
it's just a personal problem i have to overcome."
"Right?  And in my experience hospital staff tends to say things like ""is there anyone you need to call"". 

It's just horse shit.  OP is lying."
"This is a relationships subreddit, so I won't dwell on the fact that you expect someone else to pay for 92% of your living expenses. Compromise. Choose a cheaper apartment, agree to continue your relationship without cohabitating, set a timeline whereby you begin to pay x% of rent after you achieve $x in savings. Sell the expensive car and buy used like your boyfriend. 

If you can't find a compromise, it seems you should go back to live with your parents until you adjust your cost of living and can financially contribute to living with your boyfriend, or find someone willing to accept a $100/month contribution towards joint expenses. "
"Sure looks like all the signs of cheating, to me."
She was heavy when they got together. So was he. She doesn't seem to be unhappy with her weight. OP wants her to change so she can continue to support him emotionally and financially.
AND if she's not interested accept it.  Don't accidentally become a creep. 
"Tell her you are sorry you did not tell her. But also ask for understanding. Those are your sons who are in very critical condition. Your mind went blank and didn't think of anything else except for them. Tell her it would have been the same if she had been in the hospital, you wouldn't think of anyone else. Do not pressure her to go visit, just tell her, here are the visiting hours, and this is when we will be there. It's up to her to decide. 

It would have been good to inform her, but I can understand that you were thinking about your sons, and rightfully so, so you didn't think of anything or anyone else. I don't believe you are wrong. 

Although I can understand she is upset, she is very selfish to make this moment all about her. She should focus on her brothers. A 25 year old woman should know better.

"
"&gt;For just a little bit of our background, we got married so early because she needed a permanent residency here and I was a citizen. 

She's using you, and she's trying to get you to stick around while she finds a man she actually wants to be with, not the first guy to commit so she could get residency.

This would be immediate divorce territory, and you should probably report her to immigration once you're done with that."
[removed]
"I commented to you elsewhere, but if this is on your home computer please make sure you clear your internet history and make sure your phone is locked/cleared if that is what you are using. "
"I was pretty surprised by the end of that sentence. I totally did not expect ""told you"" instead of ""done it"". Those two words make all the difference - this dude is scum."
"Fuck off.

You could have killed the mood right quick if you had said ""Look, I'm seeing someone else.""

And oh my god, you are a goddamn piece of work.

You're the asshole here, the shit, the cheater, and somehow, she's the one who has to make the effort.

What about you, man? You're the one who burned this bridge, you're the one who has to do the work of rebuilding it. You'll have to _earn_ her compassion. _Earn_ her forgiveness. And it won't be done by calling her childish, mean, immature, and trying to claim you did nothing wrong."
"Right, he hasn't said he's doing any of that, but he also hasn't said he isn't.  All of his answers are just responses for clarification, he doesn't make a single excuse for anything.

OP is making a lot of far-reaching assumptions with no basis.

&gt;He isn't going to make her appologize to the coworkers or fix this at all. He's 8-9 years into the relationship and she's got him under her thumb. :(

This is total conjecture and reeks of projection.  OP hasn't said this anywhere."
"You lost trust??? Dude, YOU did this to yourself by not communicating your true feelings to your wife. 

If you do not want her to do sexual things with other people, don't say ""if it's to satisfy curiosity that it's okay"" if that's not how you really feel. 

Let this go. When you have calmed down, talk to her and set your boundaries and expectations clearly and without ulterior motive, then move forward."
"&gt; And here I was thinking he was either passive aggressively ""punishing"" you for coming to bed too late, or that he's in there spread eagle pegging himself 

Hahaha, the mind of someone who reads r/relationships..."
"I honestly think that the birthday thing is just allowing you to stay further in denial. You're focusing on the unimportant issue (my boyfriend got drunk and abandoned me on my birthday) and not the actual issue (my boyfriend is a raging, untreated alcoholic who regularly endangers his life and the lives of others). You should really tell him that he gets treated or you're gone. Anything besides that is enabling him. He might need to lose something important (you) to finally hit rock bottom."

"Thanks, this is what I imagine too. There's no way it's going to be a well-adjusted cat. It is a very small kitten (I think she only got it a few weeks before I met her) so the only reason it's being so nice, I imagine, is that it hasn't got any hormones yet. Speaking of which, how old do they have to be before you can neuter them? Mine came pre-neutered at 6 months old.

When I call animal control or animal services or whatever it's called, I'm going to stress to them to please advise her about the mental effects of confining the cat like this... Thing is, like I mentioned elsewhere, I don't believe there's enough evidence to prove that the cat is being imprisoned. I just don't want to pre-empt them with ""You won't find any evidence"" because then what if they don't even bother going?

The best I feel is going to result out of animal services is that they will educate her. I just want to ensure that they do so without dissuading them by letting them know they're not going to find anything if they go there.

EDIT: Wait, what if I called them at like 11pm? Would they do a night-call or something if I said there was imminent danger, or something like that?"
"It's not because you're wrong, it's because asking someone to get rid of their pet as part of introducing yourself to them is going to go poorly. You've been put in a bad situation and you only have uncomfortable options."
"That's even worse, in a way.  You want to use her for some fun, then send her back to cleaning your toilets.

Date someone else."
"Buying a house together is not a smart financial decision when you're still boyfriend/girlfriend. If you guys break up, it becomes a whole big legal mess.

I think it's the easiest solution is to have her pay 'rent' to help with the mortgage payment. She's contributing, but if you end up breaking up there's no need to fight over ownership of the house (and all she's lost is rent, which she would have paid anywhere she lived). If you end up getting married, the house becomes a joint asset and is officially both of yours."
and you seem terribly commited that her using a family name would be somehow more virtous and erase the histroy of ever being married.
"One, that's a purely American thing and would not fly in other countries. And two, she is doing all this as a game to manipulate people. That's why she is troubled."
"&gt;You seem to think your kids having anything of her last name means her (dead!) Ex has some weird sort of ownership over them

Where does OP say the Ex is dead?

He said they got divorced in the open post, so the marriage did not end as a result of her being widow. "
"Have some self respect, call him out on his bs and stop dating a racist.

If you were dating a white guy and he made negative comments about black people and threw around negative stereotypes you'd probably drop him in a heartbeat, don't be confused because the racism is towards white people. It's not levelling the field and striving for equality it's racism and he sounds like an asshole. "
"In dating/hooking up/romantic situations, a vague answer means ""no"".   Sorry.

For pity's sake *don't* turn the charm up or try to change her mind.  999 out of 1000 women are majorly creeped out when somebody they've turned down tries to keep on wooing."
Why though? They abused him.
"Ok Tinder guy was a dishonest douchebag. He doesn't care about you and doesn't want to be friends. He wanted to keep things ""friendly"" so he could try to fuck you when he came through town again. Block him on everything and get back on Tinder. There are so many guys out there.

The thing with your son is hard and I'm sorry you're going through that, but I have to say that this sounds like the best situation for everyone. He gets a stable home environment, able to see his sister, etc, and it'll be easier for you to focus on school and bettering your situation.

Someday he will need you more than he does now, and you'll want to be there for him. Just keep your head up and work on taking care of yourself so you can be when the time comes."
"If the father goes through the courts he will have to establish paternity, and then would almost certainly get visitation. Likely just a couple hours of supervised a week to start since he's a stranger to the kid. 

He would also be ordered to be an actual parent which means providing for your child. "
Well shit that's an amazing explanation!
When exactly did she choose to lose her finger? 
Holy fuck dude. Get help. 
"Even if this was an accident and not a prank, I think this is what you'd call a dealbreaker."
"Seriously. I've sugared, and to make any kind of consistent money, it's a full-time gig. To make six figures? She'd have to have several guys paying up, and I'm pretty sure OP would notice if she was literally never home due to her impossible schedule of school, work, and dating rich men."
Was he excited when you discovered you were pregnant? Are you sure he's going to even stick around when the baby is born? Because these actions do seem to be indicative of someone who is 'sticking their head in the sand'. Do what's best for you. 
"&gt; I just want to do whatever I can to give her the information she needs to eventually move on.

The best info is no info -- nothing to agonize over that she did ""wrong"" or should have done ""better."" A clean break is the kindest. The letter would only serve you. Don't do that to her. The only info she needs is what you've already told her. You don't want to be with her anymore. "
"How is it selfish to take care of yourself? No one else is going to, especially not an abusive alcoholic. Are you going to waste the rest of your life doing something you really don't want to do just because of guilt? Don't do that to yourself. Move on, show those girls that women don't have to be stuck in awful situations. Right now you are teaching them that women have to martyr themselves because women are supposed to sacrifice their lives and personal needs for everyone around them."

"Sounds like we found a choker, boys!"
[removed]
Sorry that was a typo. She asked me if I could move into my dad's. Sorry for the confusion. That first I is not supposed to be there I'll fix it in my post. 
"I'd just straight up ask her wtf is going on, why does she do this?"
"I see. Sounds like she is right though, and just looking out for you.

Wonder how long it took her to figure it out. She probably wishes someone told her what he was up to."
Even if a psychologist saw this thread they couldn't tell you. They would need at minimum to work with you in session and it may not be possible for them to know for sure either. But it's worth getting some  counseling to help you work through this.
"Dude. Seriously? 

Why did you marry someone you felt you had to hide your hobbies from? You didn't say much, so I can't tell if you're cripplingly insecure or if she's cruelly judgmental. Maybe both?

Do you hide other stuff from her?

Tell her, and get yourself into therapy to find out why you either married someone you can't share your basic hobbies with, or why you felt you had to hide something so completely innocuous. Neither are good or healthy. "
It kind of sounds like a ton of little issues over the year just bottle up and explode at one point because they're never addressed or never actively changed.  Her reaction is not at all appropriate for the things you described so either she's mentally unstable or there's a lot of other issues going on that either she doesn't express or you aren't picking up on 
"&gt; He doesn't get to be disappointed...

Not following your logic here.

As near as I can tell, everyone ""gets"" to be disappointed about anything, always. 

It's probably not a good idea to process your life through a lens of disappointment. It very likely to rub others the wrong way. Nevertheless, it's still a choice we all get to make. "
"So, why did the sister come to you? Not her own sister, your gf?

Also, people share rooms xD 
I share a room with my sister. 

Also, it is weird. If she was just there for a few days it would of been okay.
It was nice from the begining. But now. Its a bit odd. 
What you dont understand. Is that when you live together with someone. You get to see them when you wake up  spend time together just relaxing at home. Watching tv etc.
Her sister. Gets to have that with you. And not her.
And that is pretty special in my oppinion. Thats the little things that would make me happy about living with my boyfriend. 

So the sister gets to stay with you until she wants. And the gf doesnt.
Thatll make anyone resentful. And just upset and depressed.
So literally anyone but her can do that. Thats what you are saying.
I would definitely give her a time line for her to move out and get on her own two feet 
And the reason why she come to you and not the sister is weird as fudge. I dont care if youre closer. When you feel and are in that situation you go to family. Family comes like an instict.
24 years with her sister. Vs how ever long youve talked to and intereracted with you. 

Anyway,  i suggest talking to your girlfriend.

"Uh, you're causing continued drama for yourself by continuing to have an affair with someone you knocked up who's in an actual relationship. Why is claiming your child ""causing drama"" but sleeping with a woman in a relationship not?

Your priorities are fucked, man."

Having crushes is normal. If you act on them is the important part.
"This! Your husband shouldn't be tearing you down like that. Once or twice it can be discussed and brushed off, even if it's in bad taste.

This is constant. It is not how someone who loves you should act. I don't care what he says, he does not love you."
This made me cry. Thank you. I needed this. The quotes you included at the end to illustrate your point were near direct quotes from him last night. 
"I've had incredible threesomes, really good threesomes, decent threesomes, and at least one meh threesome. I've never had a disastrous threesome. "
"Given the context of your previous abusive relationship, it may be worth your while to take a break from dating to ""reset"" a little and seek out some therapy to untangle some of the emotional trauma that you've experienced. It's unfortunate, but abusive and manipulative people seem to have an uncanny ability to sniff out people who can't assert themselves. They take advantage of people who already seem to be struggling to set boundaries. And it may also explain why you seem to be having these experiences over and over again.

I found that I became a lot more comfortable being assertive when I became more confident and had more self esteem and less social anxiety. It was like I realized ""Hey wait a sec! I am important and what I want and need is important. I deserve to be listened to and respected by everyone. And screw anyone who doesn't respect my boundaries. I'm a person with value!"" Again, it took me a year or so of therapy to realize this fully. Then, I had a lot of practice in smaller, lower stakes situations. For example, I nicely, but firmly told my friend I didn't want to share food today. I told personal trainer that I did not want to do a certain exercise group. I told a cashier he had accidentally shortchanged me. I told a barista that she gave me the wrong drink. I built up confidence and learned that no one really minds these kinds of ""confrontations"". And then I applied it to my relationships. Clear communication has helped me a lot. A lot of my relationships and social interactions have improved. You can do it too!"
I'm also a woman and your opinion doesn't speak for our  entire gender. 
"Get a roommate don't get back together with your boyfriend, simple."
I shudder to think what I might get instead if it was hairless... nail clippings?
Ok but this gift in particular is clearly more about cats than it is about crafts. 
"I think through this thread I've realised she's just in her own world, so I don't think she'll understand even if I tell her as nicely as I can. I'll just have to say no to the gifts next time"
"OP should definitely argue that nuance when he asks her out. It'll make all the difference in the world. He should also mention that she's the right ""horse""."
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
"Just buy her stuff every times she buys you something. A ticket = some cool hair bobbles that she'd like

A meal = this new weird snack that you saw that you want to watch gip on haha might I mention well packaged. Not something off the floor.

Music = show her this new song and how you get your freak on to it.

Etc etc"
"10 year ago when my husband and I were looking for a place, we couldn't even put my husband on the mortgage because he didn't have a credit history.  We had to qualify for the loan on my income only.  You and your husband should probably go talk to a financial planner or start reading resources from personal finance about getting your ducks in a row to buy a house.  Building solid long-standing credit histories for both of you is an important step.  "
"Ding, ding, ding!

He's able to put a face to the whole thing, OP. Before it was just a piece of your personal history. Now it feels so much more real and tangible to him.

The processing part can be an undetermined amount of time. Could be over tomorrow, or he could be lamenting for months. Or he could never get over it. Who knows?

But what I can tell you, from a man's perspective, is there isn't really ""anything"" you could do about it. This is a very personal thing. For example, there are some people that have retro-active jealousy. We see it a lot here. That's a personal problem. That's an issue people either get over themselves through themselves, or something they don't and it it breaks the relationship apart.

And OP, let's by honest: Your history is different. Not ""typical,"" right? This is territory that not many people have experience with. People have this horrible stigma against people paying for sex, so I think its not out of the question for people to have a stigma against those that seek payment for sex, right? It is a taboo that you have to be able to wrap your head around. Some people can, other's can't.

Good luck."
Closure is a myth. Block her number. Delete her off social media. Find other things to gauge your interest and distract you. Move on.

"Pretty beside the point, but lots of people take multiple tabs. I have friends that go to festivals and eat a 10-strip. It just depends on how you personally experience acid (stronger for some than others) and how hard you want to trip."
"Two years is a short time? Okay...

If after two years, my SO went to an international wedding and *didn't* want to take me to meet one of their parents for the first time, I'd be pissed.

There are legitimate reasons not to want to go, like, if that's a really bad time at work, or if it would wipe out your leave for the year, or if you couldn't afford it. He is, of course, entitled to his decision. But I think OP is entitled to be upset about it, and decide if his attitude speaks to a deeper issue that might make her reconsider the relationship entirely."

"Her feelings are hurt and she's behaving immaturely. But if you're ready to throw it all away rather than, you know, talk about how you're both feeling, then you aren't ready for marriage and neither is she. "
So it can't be returned. 
Yeah dude there's not enough info at all. 
"Do NOT assume that you are safe around her merely because you *think* you know that she is ""kind"".

People who are sociopaths have learned very early - pre-kindergarden - that they have to hide the fact that they feel no guilt or remorse for hurting animals and people. Instead, they start wearing a mask of normalcy as otherwise they get called out for unacceptable behavior.

Your wife may have broached the subject now because she feels that you are now invested enough in her emotionally that she can keep you from running away.

Note how it turned from ""help, I am a victim of violent thoughts"" to ""I enjoy watching and fantasizing the torture and destruction of sentient beings including people"" - and now she is asking you to accept her sick arguments.

I'm also not surprised that she had ""bad experiences"" with the mental health system and says she doesn't want to go. They may look beneath the mask and discover an unmedicated sociopath.

You cannot help her. You can only try to protect yourself and your boundaries.

Ask yourself if you are scared of what she might do if you left her. The next person deserving a live skinning in her mind might be you.

And this is why I would strongly suggest *you* go and see a psychologist for your own sanity. Heor she can start to help you unpack the relationship you are in.

BTW: I would walk if I were you. She already declined to get help and is talking to other people who are helping her normalize atrocities. I'd leave when she is not at home, find a safe space she does not know. and not meet her one-on-on anymore.

Because with someone who has decided that those who wrong her deserve to die a painful death - an idea that she admitted *makes her happy* - may decide that if you set an ultimatim, it might just as well be your last one."
I think this is over explaining.

"I think what the commenter meant though was that should he get clean (which absolutely is possible!), he still will be changed due to all this. Not necessarily for the worse, by any means, but he won't be that same person she clicked so well with for the first 3 years. 

She could click with the new person he becomes, but there relationship will fundamentally be different. Not to mention all the trust she'll have to be able to have that him being clean is long-term. That can be really hard to do for the loved ones, no matter how motivated the person they love with a substance use disorder is to get clean--because exactly as you point out, it doesn't always ""take"" the first time(s). "
"This is absolutely correct! I've had reproductive disfunction since I started puberty, and it took me **years** to get my hysterectomy. Doctor after doctor brushed aside my pain and my feelings because I didn't have children, and I was ""too young"" to know I wouldn't want to have any. I was told that I was too young at 26.   
When I finally got the surgery, turns out I couldn't have born kids myself anyway- would've been ectopic and bad. "
"Oh well.

But what do you think of my other point; that this is a TERRIBLE lesson to teach - enabling her misdemeanours by the whole family lying?"
"Okay got it, when I get married I have to cut off all the people who have supported me and loved me while growing up"
"Stop trying to play devils advocate when this guy sexually assaulted you. This isn't some innocent fetish, you said you didn't want sex and he did this. 

You're really doing yourself a huge disservice trying to see any reason to sexual assault. This guy literally did this while you were sleeping and took pictures of it. Does that sound like a good person?

He thought you were waking up and waited for you to fall asleep again. He didn't just try this one time, it was MULTIPLE times with him stopping to make sure you were still sleeping. Then he tries to enter you while you're sleeping again. 

You can be best friends with someone as long as you want. But you've been in a relationship with him for a couple of months. Relationships and friendships are two completely different things and now you see how he treats his girlfriend when she isn't up for sex. Talk to the police. "
"I have a strong suspicion about that as well. If they never see her pregnant and already disapprove, he'll just bail after and call her a crazy cheating ex or something. 

Unfortunately for him, if that is the case, he can't escape child support. She'll still have some financial assistance and the support of people who actually love her. 

He's pretty dumb if he's thinking of doing that, but I still suspect he might be. "
"*All guys seem to just want sex and the thought of having sex terrifies me for some reason and I don't think I'll ever be able to get over that fear.*
 
This sort of jumped out at me. While you're only 17 and you have plenty of time to mature and follow your own timeline for sex or no sex, I think you might want to explore this issue a little bit, maybe with a trusted adult or counselor. I don't know why you harbor this fear, but please don't let fear rob you of the possibility of intimacy in your life and prevent you from having a relationship you may want in the future."
"It's stupid to bet on it, one anecdote doesn't change that. "
I know that 24 is still young and it could've been 19 years instead of 9 but I don't know.. When  I found out about this other guy I did have a mental break down and that wasn't pleasant.. Its the whole having to restart my life all over again that's rather daunting.. Thank you for the kind words. I hope it will get better in time.
"&gt; laugh and say not all of them! You're saying the same about me

No, don't make it about you, she might agree in person but then whisper in Andy's ear later 'but how can you know for sure'.  Instead, laugh and say ""not all of them! I met Andy online and he's the bestest, most kind, super awesome person in the world, and he'd never do something like that"".  She can't refute that without convincing Andy that he's also a bad person.

Don't make you the focus when talking about this.  If you try to convince Andy there's nothing wrong with you even though you met online, he might believe you but he might have lingering tiny doubts.  If you put the emphasis that he's the one *you* met online then because he sees himself as not a bad person he will convince himself that not everyone is like that and by extension you aren't either."

He's not stuck paying $20 for a dish he will likely not like. OP isn't stuck wasting time cooking for him.

Here's another idea. He wants to try a new recipe? Fine, but have him cook it (on the week-ends?). Perhaps he'll like it better if he's the one who put his time into it.  "
"As someone who has gained and lost weight on many meds that have ""weight gain"" as a side effect, all it does is increase appetite and/or make you more lethargic. It doesn't make maintenance 'nearly' impossible. Just like you can gain weight on a drug with ""weight loss"" as a side effect, like my friend who gained 45lb while on Vyvanse. 

Now, do I blame this guy for 'letting himself go' while he's dealing with a lot of trauma? Not really. But he can lose it if he wants to and it'll be better for his health too. 

It's not easy but it's very simple. I've lost weight whole being hypo, having PCOS, and feeling like absolute crap because of meds. It's as simple as eating less than you expend in a day. "
"Good response, but OP already messed up by not telling her that before lying to his aunt and saying it was his problem, not his gfs."
"&gt; So is it that she doesn't love me anymore, or is it that she is pushing me away and heaping as much blame on me as she can to make her feel better about the abortion?

How could you possibly expect me to know the answer to that question? I can't read her mind.

&gt;So if she tries to get back with me what do you think I should do?

Run.

&gt;Also, is there ever any hope in convincing somebody their behavior is not logical or acceptable?

Sure, if they're generally open to logic and sound rationale. But it doesn't sound like she has been lately, at least not hearing it from you. You can try couple's counseling, but that takes effort on both your part and hers -- as does a healthy relationship. If she's not willing to put the effort in, you can't force her to do so.

&gt;Also, I read somewhere that women never break up with a man unless they have a man on deck, what do you think of the possibility? Could it be another man is sweet talking her and bad mouthing me?

For fuck's sake...that's a stupid generalization about women, and it's frankly fucking insulting. I've broken up with plenty of men without having one ""on deck."" Some folks, regardless of gender, can be just fine without a relationship or a partner. I was single for over 3 years before I met my now-husband."
"Put yourself in his shoes for a moment.

Would you want your SO to be cheating around on you for 7months, get pregnant by the dude, and leave the baby for you? While you're also taking responsibility over another child of her's that wasn't your's to begin with.

Think about the shame, yo.

That ain't right, boyo. "
we're seriously considering it. I would never want him to lose his job or worse because of the things they have said about him
"Bullshit.

Respect is earned...not given"
Does it really matter? The point is she is in a toxic situation
it's an interesting perspective that the person doing the berating isn't the one torpedoing the relationship.  
"This is not worth bringing up, and not a hill to die on. She has cleavage and legs. You can't expect her to always hide them. "
"One - I think he has to deal with 2 issues separately. The first is he was lied to, and that burns on its own. He probably feels both angry at the people who lied to him and angry at himself for believing it. He needs to work through that. Sometimes that sort of thing just takes time but it has been awhile so a therapist of some sort may help. I think he's mixing this up with the second issue, which is the real issue. The second is that the job isn't what he wants. He should keep it for now but look into other jobs that are what he wants, while maintaining appearances as his current job. If he wants to make a food blog on the side to cheer himself up, that's reasonable to a degree. The over-eating isn't a great thing, of course. Perhaps y'all can try to keep active and go out and do things that will mitigate that for him health-wise. 

2 - Have you tried things like Meetup groups? Have you joined a local gym and taken any classes where women might go regularly (spinning, yoga, etc) and have similar interests? What are your interests? I'm not sure how you currently spend your days. I also don't know the area that well (I have family in CA but not in LA specifically) and imagine it's a tough city in many ways. 

3 - It's not uncommon for even upper middle class people to worry about money especially if their careers are feeling imperfect. Save routinely. Be smart about spending and investments. But try not to let worry consume you. "
This sounds like a great way to do it - it's a visual reminder and gets them to actually 'see'. Some people seem to mentally convince themselves the opposite of what's actually happening. 
"You don't have to turn your back on her. It does not negate  the last 10 years. But you don't keep going because of the amount of time invested is all I'm saying. 

Your 29.  I just don't want to see someone 29 years old give up their 30s basically. Relationship building, career building, fun years potentially!  

What if she changes drastically in prison and comes out and wants to start over without you?  And you've given up those years?

Life is short. Just my opinion and as we all know opinions are like assholes....everyone has them.....but I wouldn't want to see you spend your thirties with this leash on you. Commit to them and experience the present.  It will be hard to be in the present when your mind and heart are pulled in two directions. It would be like having a long distance relationship for that long. 

Best wishes!  It's your life,your decision obviously!!  Cheers-"
"Not necessarily. I'm also a plant fanatic, and many of the plants she named command very high priced. The pilea, for example, is *at minimum* $40 for a clipping. For a full plant...they must be well into the hundreds of dollars. 
Same with the monstera‚Äîa variegated monstera is about $100 for a tiny plant in a 6 inch pot. Again, a large, mature plant will be many hundreds of dollars, if you could even find one. 

OP wasn't joking when she said she had very rare plants. These are varieties that most plant fanatics can only dream of. And there's a very high premium on these kinds of plants. "

"I've been stalked and attacked in the past and it's a horrible horrible experience and nothing feels safe anymore.. the things that helped. My uncle bought me a tazer, my brother and friend taught me self defense, and my therapist helped me a ton. My family actually blamed me for being for being stalked (very much ""you were asking for it"") so by being on your daughters side you are already doing the right thing and are helping support her. I definitely advise therapy, and self defense and maybe a non lethal weapon (I've never used my tazer but it made me feel safe when walking home alone to my car ect) "
"the thing is, you have to stick to a medication for longer than a couple of weeks for it to take affect. even then, it takes time to find the right medication. this also goes for a therapist. if he doesn't care enough to change his behavior, or doesn't want to do anything different and would rather spend all of his time participating in his pity party, there's nothing you can do. nada. he has to want to change, and he doesn't."
"If this was a long-term relationship, and this was a new development, I'd agree.

"This is absolutely harassment and needs to be reported immediately. I understand that you love your job but the safety and well-being of both youu and the baby is far more important. Go to the cops, and bring with you the letter from the ""lawyer"" and a print out of the messages she sent your husband, if possible, as proof. I would also ask the CEO if you could possibly work from home until this summers down. Good luck, OP. "
"I completely agree. Being someone who started where you are and now finds himself a sex addict, this is all too familiar. 

It sounds like a big part of what's happening here is a lack of connection. It's ultimately what can push one to indulge with someone outside of their relationship.

 Talk to your wife.

 And then find friends and go do things with them. It's rare that a one on one relationship can amount to being enough to satiate the connections one needs to feel fulfilled. A coop office sounds like a great suggestion. Get out, be around people. Connect. And talk it out with her"
"&gt;  If I saved literally nothing I could afford $600 per month, but that means I'm not saving anything.

I am understanding it correctly that you only have $100 per month to share towards living expenses because you need to save $500 per month for yourself?  If that is correct, then this could be a legitimate argument for your boyfriend to make, as in he subsidies your housing costs so you can save money for yourself.  I would say that's not really fair for him.  

I think the best recourse for you would be to go to r/personalfinance and lay out both of your incomes and expenses.  They are generally good at identifying what is fair and can help you reduce expenses. "

"I just said this on another post but think it applies here. Love is a verb. Verbs are action words. She is showing you that she doesn't love you. It hurts, I know. It hurts like hell. But when you're in hell, keep going. Don't stop and get caught up in it. There's another side once you get through. A side with a new, happy, and adventurous (albeit divorced) life. She's already gone, so let her stay gone so you can heal. Hugs from this internet stranger."
"This is the exact reason I wouldn't even throw the word cheating out in confronting her if I were OP.  More like, ""You knew you were doing something I wouldn't be happy about, and you decided to lie to me to hide it from me.""

Arguing about whether it's technically cheating or not is really beside the more important point, and it'd be a mistake to get caught up on it."
"Sorry to hear about this; good on you for making the right decision to break up with him. 

I would tell her. But be prepared that she might get angry with *you*, or that they'll stay together. 

As someone else mentioned, get tested."
"I'd argue the utter opposite...she has a few months to live and she's choosing to spend it with you.

If you feel so guilty, then ask her out. As crass as it is to say, the long term just isn't there so why not enjoy the short term? You both enjoy each other and like spending time with each other. If you're both fine with FWBs then no worries. If y'all want something more then go for it.

A lot of people wouldn't be able to stay in that situation so it's understandable if you can't. It just seems like you're both happy with this arrangement - you're just rightfully sad it is finite. "

EDIT: also, are you saying that you and her have already talked about how to raise the puppy? why didnt you tell her then that you didnt want her involved in ownership? was this always supposed to be your dog and she misunderstood, or was this supposed to be combined ownership, but now you disagree with how to raise it so you want to raise it alone?"

"In the same position. A male friend recently *almost* asked me out (via a social media message, which he immediately deleted). He's cute, in amazing shape, well-travelled, good job... Basically a catch. When I picked up on it and asked him why he'd backed off, he said ""because you're you and you wouldn't be interested in me"" 

It was an eye-opener. I've spent my life thinking I would never have any genuine interest, just attention from players only after FWB. Sadly I left the country a month later and nothing happened!"
I feel like he's deliberately avoided answering the question about whether they live together...
"1. You told him? THAT's fucked up. You literally told your bf that on the first night you had sex with him - literally a couple of hours earlier another guy had had sex with you. AND, you didn't use condoms. That. is. disgusting. For many people that'd be a dealbreaker.

2. YOU chose to go bareback with two guys in the same night. One of them you'd only just met. So, I guess you've never heard of STDs. Ok.

3. You somehow *somehow* didn't think that these two facts wouldn't bother him. And you don't understand why he doesn't want you to see you 'best friend.' 

I mean, it's great how 'open' you are, but how fucking naive are you? I think most guys and girls would see this as a dealbreaker. You're clearly poly, which is cool, so stick with poly or go through your life devastating your partners. "
Sounds like it is because of you. 
"Just wanna let ya know that fantasy does not always equate to reality. However, 18 is legal so I'm not sure why you're disturbed by this.  What are you afraid of her doing exactly?   Finding them attractive?  Plenty of 18 yer olds look older than 18 and even so again, 18 is a legal age.  They're adults. Dating an 18 year old when you're 24 isn't that bad either. I'm not sure what you're so worried about."
"Nope, nope, nope. Get out. If you smoke only once in a while and he feels he has the right to harass you and then slap you, you shouldn't think twice about this. I know people are saying you blowing smoke in his face is also assault and shit, but they're nowhere near comparable. One has the possibility of doing real damage, the other is kind of asshole-ish, yeah, but not damaging. My father used to apologize to me sometimes too after he'd hit me in the heat of the moment for things like forgetting where I put a plane ticket a month prior...

Yeah but the situation you describe has consent written all over it. There was no consent in OP'S post. Ergo the rape.
"Been there. Knew each other since we were 5. Cut her out when we were 22.  She was a habitual liar and stole from stores, friends and her grandparents.  She fucked 3 of her best friends ex boyfriends, and made it her ""thing"" of sorts.  She slithered her way into my group of friends (we'd never really been in the same circles), fucked over one of my close friends (led him on, cheated on him the whole time, gave him an STD, broke his heart), and fucked me over as a roommate (lied about $ owed so I had to pay a *lot* when I left).

This has red flags all over it. Exactly the sort of situation people come to regret. "

You could ask if he has plans? You could plan things ahead of time if you want to do something special? You could get over the fact that he's hanging with a woman, especially since you probably don't get bent when he hangs with men?

&gt; What's wrong with letting him?

The problem is thinking you ""let"" him. As if he needs to do as you say if you say otherwise. If i told a person i ""let"" them breathe, could you imagine how strange that would be? It's a strange and possessive head space.

&gt; The rest of that paragraph

You say you trust him, but insist on ""protecting"" him. From what? The women he had ample opportunity to date instead of you? (Honestly they're probably not as insecure as you, so if he leaves you for any of them that's probably the reason. Not them being ""sluts"", but them not treating him like a child or object to be sheltered from people.)

You have a lot of issues from what i can tell from your post, and i seriously suggest unpacking all those internalized feelings if you ever want to have a successful and long lasting relationship where both partners are happy.

If you don't want to do that, then breakup and find a guy who you don't have to come to Reddit and ask for advice to manipulate for. There's seriously a ton of guys with your mindset. You're just gonna make this guy miserable if you don't change."
"She's literally asking if she's overreacting or not, so she doesn't know she overreacting ""so much"" "
"You clearly have no idea of the vast emotional and mental damage caused by abusive relationships.  The shame and humiliation.  You are wrong, and you need to stop."
"&gt;That was the only thing he has done to make me doubt it him. 

I mean, that's a pretty big thing though.  To me, it's not that he didn't delete her when you asked, it's that he's okay with having someone in his life that shit talks his wife.  Why would he want a friend like that?  I'd see about getting him to come with you to some sessions of therapy so you can delve into this further.

"I think it does put you in the minority. Sex is a perfectly natural thing, why not talk about it with family? "
"This. Right here, OP.
The only apologies that should be directed at anyone are to you. 
  
&gt;She told me she had to seriously think if our almost 4 year relationship is worth keeping because her friends are her life

What kind of manipulative bullshit is that? YOU should be the one angry for an outburst like that."
"So he's abusive, belligerent and takes you for granted. There's an expression, 'He only hits me when he drinks...'. Some things completely negate any positives about a person or a relationship. If he's unwilling to see his own mistakes, then he's not mature enough for a relationship.

Finally, when one's partner asks one to cook, it's not a tit-for-tat question, or whose turn it is. The right response on his part is to happily cook, not get all huffy like some spoiled brat. If this behavior is something that you're used to, it's time to go."
"Koreans tend to only like to marry other Koreans. There are some who marry other races. But, your boyfriend has told you his parents want him to marry a Korean and he is leaning towards that as well.

It sounds like he has a history of wasting people's time: such as his ex, and now possibly you. Your friends are right that you should leave him and find someone who loves you and isn't racist.

If you do decide to stay with him, you gotta accept that it might be a temporary relationship with an ending date and not lie to yourself about it."
"&gt;I mean, I get where you're coming from... but the default assumption is that your relationship with someone will be considered when deciding how to act towards them. 

&gt;If you think the relationship history should be ignored in this case, I'm interested to hear your reasoning.  


1. Not this poster but I've done lots and lots of therapy to learn how how normal people with normal boundaries work and within normal boundaries the amount of money more than justifies legally getting it(I know right? Where is the guilt trip, shaming, fear of only acting out of anger?)

It doesn't matter. You are owed money you collect it. 

Basically the amount he owes is staggering. The amount alone is justification to get what you are owed. 

2. Your mom needs it. NEEDS IT. She will probably die earlier than she needs to without it. 

3. Both of those points remove your personal issues. And are justification all by themselves. 

4. I would hit /r/raisedbynarcicissts because I have never ever heard a more textbook case of a narcicisst parent than you father. He is what they all wish they were. 

5. Get some therapy. You have earned it. The fact that you had to ask this question (I would have too, btw) means you have some lingering boundry issues. Mainly in how bad this guy is. 

5. Please.  Fucking. Get. Him. 

People like this tend to skate because everyone is too exhausted to fight them. I am dealing with it with my husband right now. My son is like you and helped me immensely, mostly by giving me the couple grand I needed to escape and the reminder that justice isn't revenge. I'm exhausted and he isn't even the father of my kids. He managed to trap me so securely and disappear so cleanly that I ended up in a homeless shelter when he disappeared from the psych ward as if he was going to commit suicide. **He tried to use the fact that I reported him missing to get a restraining order last month.**

6.(this one is my revenge streak wishing I could do more to mine other than jail for domestic violence) I hope you cause him a LOT of pain. The destruction these people cause, the life long obsession of ""getting"" your mom is so messed up. 

Do it for people everywhere who don't have the resources to bring their narcicissts down and help their parent who protected them. 

**Your mom needs this money. Enjoy the impact on him while doing the right thing. It's not very often you get both. Enjoy!!**

"There is nothing wrong with being opposed to dancing.  But there is something not entirely right about being 100% recalcitrant about refusing to even try something that your partner enjoys and isn't abnormal.  Not as a dancer or individual, but as a fun, romantic and willing partner. 

I'm very much like OP (and way more like that when I was his age).  I hate dancing.  My wife likes it.  In fact, the day before we got together (we were casual friends), she asked me to dance at a party and I flatly rejected her (whoops).  

It doesn't come up very often, because we're old now, but when it does come up, I dance with her a little bit.  And we even took some fancy dancing lessons over the course of a few weekends, that were kind of fun but I also kind of hated.  Ultimately, it was nice to try something different.  It wasn't the end of the world and it made her really happy.

It's not about the dancing, it's about spending time together in a social custom that's kind of designed for partners to spend time together.  And pushing past your comfort zone a bit, for personal growth and to accommodate your partner.

I'm not defending the reaction after OP refused, mind you (nor his reaction after that).  And OP has the right to say, ""I'm not doing this, I'm never doing this.""  But while it's his right, it also kind of makes him a limp partner that he can't even make a small effort or accommodation.  Unless there's a back story that involves phobia or trauma, a good partner tries a little bit (and his good partner, in return, respects that he tried a little bit).  "
"To keep it really safe, use a primarily online bank and don't keep a physical card."
"I agree. My SO and I are in the process of getting engaged and it's mostly conversations. The way we moved it along is picking out rings and discussing a tentative wedding date/budget.

For us the ""proposal"" will be a formality and a way to jump-start a conversation with our parents about wedding details and plan the actual event. I think it's popular with social media too, because instead of just having an engagement party and inviting immediate friends/family, you can announce your engagement to all your acquaintances too."
We have a winner in the comments.
"Not taking sides, but I'd say blowing cigarette-smoke to someone's face was the first thing that made that encounter physical. On a waaayyyy smaller scale and by all means *NOT* something that requires a slap, but physical nevertheless.

EDIT: added the missed *NOT*. never intended to say blowing smoke=deserving a slap. "
you're ignoring the rest of the comment..
"Ok it's really not that complicated. 

You guys aren't spending enough time together and you both have activities that are affecting it, but you only asked him to make a change, so he got on the defensive.

Guys are extra sensitive to girlfriends attacking their video games and male bonding activities and this sounds like it counts as both. I would take every stupid thing he said about dinner, phone use, etc and put them in the ""boyfriend got defensive"" box for now.

Then follow through with the very reasonable compromise you made. He shouldn't have to give up his friend time if you have no plans except sitting around the house so plan something and see what happens. If he acts like an ass about it then deal with it but right now you're getting worked up over nothing.

Also is there a reason you guys can't have quality time and him be able to go play with his friends within the same Sunday? Seems to be plenty of hours to me, how long is he at his friend's house?"
"This should of been discussed properly before marriage and then not gotten married. 

Just get a divorce and let her find a new guy that will give her kids. "
"My mom and her siblings weren't wanted by my grandma, she had them because it was ""what you do"" and my grandpa wanted them. She was unloving to the kids and they all grew up with various mental health issues and the inability to form healthy relationships with healthy boundaries because they were treated as unwanted burdens their entire young lives.

I would not wish that feeling of being resented and unwanted by a parent on ANYONE, and I'm sorry you went through that.

OP you made a mistake marrying this woman, don't make another mistake and doom a child to all that shit just to keep your wife, have some decency and do the right thing - divorce and be more honest about your HARD RULE for no children. There are plenty of childfree woman-fish in the sea who would be happy to not reproduce with you. This woman is not one of them."
Get a second job. Move home. Anything but complain.. you are stuck.
"Seems like OP wants her boyfriend of one year to contribute almost everything and to supplement her living style. He makes only double but is able to not only pay for everything but save 4x as much as she does. Sounds like OP has some issues with her money and not budgeting well and is hoping that her bf can take care of everything. From the bf's perspective, OP might be taking advantage of the situation. She has $600 each month, but saves $500. If she can't afford independent living without other people paying everything for her, then don't. If she wants to live independently or contribute more fairly, then she has to spend more of the $600."
"I partly agree. I would say ignore it because I feel like, if she was going to fight you, she would have done it by now.  Seems like her main tactic is this high school-esque intimidation crap and I suppose, to some degree, it's working because you no longer feel safe.

But I also get the impression she's kind of a coward. How would you feel about messaging her on facebook and asking her to talk on the phone (or even in person, one on one)? The conversation basically being like, ""I'm not sure what is going on between us but I'd like to clear the air..."""
"You're not her therapist. You can't solve all her problems with your dick. You know it's wrong and you're doing it anyway, there's no way to justify something that is inherently shitty. You're helping a shady woman continue to sneak around behind her husband's back. That's fucked up and you know it.

She's 2 decades older than you. If you were a female and she was male, everyone would be saying you were being preyed upon by someone looking to exploit your youth. Get out of this, find a normal healthy relationship with someone your own age with less baggage."
"Mentally, you have left the relationship. Now you're just putting yourself through the motions of being together whilst constantly thinking of ending it. As someone who did this for a long time, don't. 
If you're thinking of ending it- do it sooner rather than later because you're just hurting yourself by staying with him. 

Communication is always key, I would say start talking to him about how you feel. It seems like you know him well, and hopefully know how to approach touchy topics without too much arguing. Just keep calm and say you're getting no second thoughts. 

My other piece of advice would be if you do break up, write a list similar to what you've posted about all the things you didn't like about him and how shit he has made you feel. Then, if he comes back and you're thinking of giving him a second chance you can refer back to the list and remember why you left in the first place. "
"yeah... poly can be a good solution and i wish it wouldn't get shat on all the time as a suggestion, but this is exactly the wrong situation for it. "
"Nope.  But he's the one asking for suggestions, and he's the one trying to work on their relationship at the moment, so he's the the one getting practical advice.  Starting with getting them both real counseling.  

I also have no idea what her side of the story is - is she feeling totally overwhelmed and never getting a break, just too worried about her son, or is something else going on?  

Honestly, she'd get a lot of the same advice.  Find a little time for herself in the day, then find time for dates and reconnect with her husband.  She should get out with her daughter for some fun trips and reconnect there.  There's a good reason for her to sleep in with her son, but they need some respite care and a chance to keep their relationship going."
Have sex with the guy too so you're both even.
"If you are genuinely curious about the reason you have been downvoted I will tell you. 

You are acting like OP is too stupid to have considered that adoption is an option for her so it comes off as condescending and like you are trying to shame her for aborting. You're kicking OP down when she is already living one of the worst times of her life. Obviously your behaviour is offensive."
"Yes, it is normal for a penis to become erect."
"I mean how much did he really care about her opinion? Since he knew she wanted a tattoo because she told him when they started dating.

I think it's totally fine if he breaks up with her because he doesn't want to date a woman with tattoos but I think it's extremely unfair of him to act the way he is because he was aware he was dating a woman who wanted to get at least one tattoo."
Does that mean she is beyond help
"Yeah, it is, and that's what he's doing to you."
"&gt; Why doesn't he just tell me straight up that he'd like to occasionally hook up and nothing more because I'd probably be okay with that, as I'm not prude and we had a good time?

A great question to ask him, not the internet or your friends. "
"I see in almost all of your comments here that you're dead-set on ""figuring out"" why he's not just upfront about wanting a FWB situation. And this quote from your OP:

&gt; I'm just completely baffled by this behavior. I know this will make me sound like a naive little girl, but we got along great and it's been a long time since I connected with someone that well and that quickly.

You're trying to decipher this because you're thinking he's wired the same way you are; compassionate, rational, and interested in people's thoughts and motives regarding their behaviour. 

Stop it. 

He's not you. The quote from above where you say ""it's been a long time since I connected with someone that well and that quickly"" is telling that YOU connected with him quickly and fast, but you're trying to figure out why he didn't feel the same connection. 

Some people suck. That's life. None of us here can tell you what he was thinking and why he behaved the way he did. Hell, even if you straight-up asked him the reason, at this point you can't be sure that **anything** he tells you would be the actual truth. Would it be nice if, in the dating world, everyone felt the same level of connection that the other person did, and behaved the same way? Fuck ya. Would have made my dating life a helluva lot easier. 

But that's not how it works. You won't be able to figure out his actual mindset/intentions by simply breaking the situation down. Only he knows why he behaved the way he did, and like I said before, he'd probably tell you anything if you asked as long as it keeps the door open for a future hook-up. 

This guy wasn't what you were looking for. You found out after you caught some feelings, which sucks, but before you became invested in each other's lives, which is a blessing. 

Get out there and find someone who actually *wants to be with you* the way you want to be with them. Don't waste any more time or mental energy on this guy because he's not worth it."
"Everybody listen to this dude, it is indeed just great. Very wholesome."
"If your post history is at all serious, you need more help than the fine folks here can provide. "
"Which part of their comment is inaccurate? He's not making his fianc√©e apologize, he's not demanding counseling, he clearly hasn't conveyed to his fianc√©e how angry he is, probably because he's afraid to. Seems to line right up with that comment. "
"Boom. This exactly. SO needs to understand he shouldn't raise the bar higher than he can deliver on. A lot of people do this because they want credit for thinking about it or having good intentions, then they forget or fail to follow through not realizing that you if you don't complete the task all that built up backfires into a lot of negative emotion. 

When they say it's, ""the thought that counts,"" that doesn't mean that, ""spinning fantasies out loud but then doing nothing to make any of that actually happen."""
"This is exactly what happened to me. The relationship ended and the next girl I got with we had plenty of sex. 

You should find someone who values sex as much as you do. "
I guess I was always told to respect a girl if she's not ready. I just never realized how fast time flies. 
"They can food prep on Sunday for the whole week, or cook big batches of soup or stews in the evenings that would last several days, or leave the food in the slow cooker in the morning so it's ready for when they come home. There are so many things he could be doing about this. Heck they could even ask Dad that they all cook together, he likely doesn't have a clue how to do it. "
"I'm so sorry this happened to you, OP. You need to leave this man, he does not respect your boundaries so cannot be trusted. 

Not to sound alarmist, but you may also want to consider a counseling session or some sort of therapy. This is an awful thing to go through,  and you will have better long term outcomes if you work through your feelings about it sooner rather than later. 

Again, I'm just so sorry. "
"Honey, she won't change. Even if she did finally have sex, she would just lay there.  No oral ever.  Move along and find someone who wants to have fun and experience sex. "
"I agree with u/Pi4yo.  He's bringing unnecessary drama to the process already, and I'm sure your boss would rather have her proven employee than a volunteer who hasn't even really started working yet.  For nonprofit managers, volunteers are kind of a blessing/curse:  you need their enthusiasm and manpower (and willingness to work for free) but a large percentage of them end up washing out either because they're flaky, lose interest, or have other personality ""quirks"" that make them not worth the trouble.  It's not like they did an exhaustive hiring search and had determined that he was the best guy for the job--he volunteered and they included him in a group training, that's the extent of their commitment.


I would tell her ""I wouldn't have mentioned it and would have just worked with him as a professional, but I'm concerned that his decision to bring up our past conflict immediately and in such a dramatic way doesn't bode well for his ability to remain professional or his ability to remain discreet about it, and I'm worried that there will be a lot of gossip and drama that will make it hard to stay focused on work.""  

The most important thing is to take a position and stick to it.  If you really feel you can't work with him, don't tell her to keep him out of some misguided need to feel professional and then either quit yourself or escalate the drama.  It will be MUCH EASIER for her to tell him to take a hike now than it would be to either replace you or to deal with Workplace Dramaz once he's established as a volunteer.  In addition, if I were your manager and you, my valued, trained employee, told me to keep this volunteer of one day out of a desire to be fair to him and then immediately started looking for a new job for yourself because you truly can't work with him, I would be kind of ticked off at you, especially since I had offered to nip the situation in the bud. She's basically offered to tell him to find another volunteer position, so I'd go ahead and take her up on the offer. 


"
I'd say it's definitely abusive. So messed up. 
"You're tired of being spoken to like an idiot, which anyone would get tired of.

I know the feeling. You bottle it up til you explode and then it's ""why are you flipping out? I just told you not to slam the door!"".

Sit her down and calmly tell her that things are going to change, and if she can't speak to you with the respect a fellow human being deserves, she shouldn't speak to you at all. It's really that simple. You need to set boundaries, and if she crosses them, you let her know she can try again or take a walk.

Male or female, if you let someone walk all over you or treat you like a punching bag, they'll continue to do so. "
"Personally I would tell him ""Boyfriend, I *am* anouncing my pregnancy 1 week from today. If you don't tell your family by that day, it is not my problem. You have been warned. This is non negotiable."""
If he fell right as the car was coming it's entirely possible. Especially if this was a busier road.

"The timeline of events you have described sound respectful of your friends memory. There appears to have been no intention (while she was alive), it is just a natural evolution of two single friends into a happy couple. I can understand why you would question the relationship, however your feelings of doubt and guilt may actually be a form of grief, especially as your friend chose to take her own life. It sounds like you and your BF are very happy together and it was a conscious well thought out decsion. And the fact that you have been up front with her brother is really great, it says alot about your depth as a person."
"&gt; at least they had a good time being near the front while I could barely see.

Didn't you say the show was a huge disappointment (which I assume means the band wasn't that good)? Wouldn't that mean it would have been disappointing no matter where you/they stood? Why would standing closer have made the show amazing?

&gt; My fianc√© said to forgive and forget but I've done that too many times, especially with her.

Could you go into more detail on this? What kind of things have you had to forgive and forget her for in the past? 

If this was a one-off instance, then I'd say you're overreacting by ending a 10-year friendship without even talking to her about it. But if she's done things like this before, then that's a whole different can of worms. "
"It isn't fair at all that he waited until you started dating to bring this up. He's also told you how he will behave if you decline ""he'll feel boxed in"" and ""start doing things which would cause a problem in the relationship"" Have one last conversation with him that this isn't something you are open to and that you are looking to settle down and to create a stable life with a monogamous partner. Ask if that is something he is interested in or if he is set on the open relationship... And he is welcome to go and have one, just without you. You can definitely find someone who respects your wishes and boundaries after you've communicated them clearly."
"Yeah, you're not going to go far in that workplace, thanks to your fiancee."
"&gt; I should also mention that for a few weeks before, he'd been talking about how he had some really great present ideas for my birthday and I was super excited. I don't have much in the way of family, so I don't get a lot of presents, especially on my birthday. 

If it weren't for this, I would agree with you.  She didn't end up getting dinner and she didn't even get her flowers."

"And yet you don't want to ""babysit"" - face it man, you do not have a future with this woman. And you don't want one by what you've said. When you Move In with a partner with a kid, it's not babysitting anymore. That kid is now partly your responsibility because by moving in together, you're making a commitment to each other long term and that means taking care of that kid, whatever care that kid needs. You don't need to be Daddy, but you do need to be a responsible adult who cares about the kid's wellbeing. 

You need to call your girlfriend and tell her you've changed your mind. Anything less is untruthful and selfish if you don't tell her soon. "
"The woman you married and dated is not the woman you are with now. People change over time, and sometimes they change for the worse. It doesn't excuse what she's done in the slightest, but it does give you good reason to accept that you now have to change and move on.

She is no longer your wife. She is a cheating, lying, disrespectful tumour and it's time to cut her off. Your wife is gone, and you will never get back the past like it was. Right now you can't reason with your heart, because your heart will be broken. And that's okay. But instead you need to use your head and protect yourself from more harm, and that begins with getting a lawyer and a fresh start.

I'm so sorry that someone as good as you has to go through this. Remember that it's okay to grieve and feel depressed. You're essentially going through a loss in your immediate family. It's not okay to blame yourself, or let her walk all over you. Get a lawyer, get some fresh air, go out with a friend and order pizza and sing karaoke to angry songs. Whatever makes you feel better, just don't let her ruin your life anymore than she already has."
"Okay he needs like round the clock care if he is in that much danger. You need to talk to his parents about his situation. He cannot stay in school like this. He cannot keep living with you like this. He needs professional help, and possibly institutionalization...

You need to talk to his parents. This is very serious and will not be solved if you keep going like you have been."
"&gt; you're not even old enough to have birthed her. 

I think this is a really key issue.  You might do more for her in kind of an older sister/cool aunt role.  Surely there was some point in your adolescence when you screwed up.  Talk about that, and especially the consequences.

And for what it's worth, I was somewhat like this into my early 20s, and most of my friends were like this.  I got sick and tired of working in sleazy bars and living paycheck-to-paycheck and grew up, and most of my friends did the same."

Knowing what I know now I would have imagined a bumbling,clumsy, creepy and scrawny loser not the charming and suave guy I met.

You're the worst. You're way too judgmental and immature to date someone like him. 

Being smart and driven academically driven doesn't make him a nerd. Being a virgin doesn't make him a loser. Wave goodbye to him on his way past you towards a successful life while you and your super cool friends find out who the actual losers are. "
"It's also possible that you are objectively an okay guy and your wife tells you how sexy you are to make you feel good.

I did that. And it wasn't a lie either. People's perception of a person's attractiveness can change over time, through frequent contact and growing feelings. 

Like I can feel like an SO is gorgeous because of how they behave and treat me and I can also take a step back and understand that my guy is no Chris Hemsworth. 

In any case don't have this idea that you are too good looking for her. 

People struggle to find someone as good as your wife. There are way more lonely unhappy people out there than there are people in great relationships.

What do you mean by hot anyway? Have you ever seen pics of women and celebrities with and without makeup, their hair done and the right clothes.

Your wife could be 'hotter' with a new hairdo, highlights, a different hair parting and makeup.... and is her not focusing on that a reason to think she's not attractive and to destroy this relationship.

You come off as truly shallow, man."
"Your wife is being completely reasonable in asking you to keep your promise.   Telling you ""Don't dirt bike any more if you get injured"" isn't a whim or a caprice; it's something an outside observer would consider a rational request, whether or not they'd make that request themselves.  She asked you for a promise, you gave it, and now you're trying to backtrack with the grounds that maybe you were too drugged to think.  

Your now-wife told you that watching you get injured was a deal-breaker for her.  You agreed to that.  Now you're complaining because it's still a deal-breaker for her.  

Pick one.  Your wife or your bike.   You can't have both."
 I will ask again. Did you discuss finances before you got married?

"Hadn't seen it mentioned yet, and such large age gaps are usually a bit concerning?"
"Yes I think you're wrong for being upset. Your boyfriend sounds like a great guy, moreso than he should be given that he appears to pay for you, work so you don't have to and shows appreciation for you all year round.

I don't feel like you have any business being upset at him, or telling him that you think you deserved something.

And even if the rest of that wasn't a thing, University is not some kind of charity run; you're doing it for yourself to gain an education in a field you want to work in, you're not doing it to receive compliments from other people (or at least I hope you're not)"
"Or they have and know what a pain it is to have to do it. I've been married, divorced, and married again. I went back to my maiden after my divorce and didn't take my husband's name in the current marriage specifically because it was such a pain to get it all figured out the first two times.

It takes a few hours of running around town for the SS card and drivers license. I bank online with two banks so that took longer and required mailed in papers. I had at least ten credit cards to change. I hold a professional license that I had to change. My retirement accounts, my workplace, my email address, my insurance, my student loans, my property taxes, my mortgage, all of my online shopping accounts, all of my mail, and the list just goes on and on.

I got a jury duty summons in my prior last name just a couple months ago and showed up but was unable to even cash the check I got because that's not my name. It's not the first time something I never even thought about had to be redone (had to provide my birth certificate, marriage certificate, divorce decree to get it swapped).

All of that for a last name she doesn't care for? Pass."
"&gt; Do you think it's possible to progress in a relationship without considering the grand scale of the relationship's future?

No, not if progressing and the grand scheme of things is important to you. I think it's possible to be content with staying where you are if that's the type of relationship you want. But I don't think it's possible to progress in a relationship like this. My SO is fun to be with and has a quirky sense of humor too, but he also acts like the 33 year old man that he is. They're out there, you can find them, but staying with someone hoping they'll change isn't in either of your best interests."
"If you can't get real answers from the people you consider your closest friends....then they aren't actually your closest friends.

I think its more likely that you are worried about what they will say and would rather just avoid the question all together than maybe actually get a response that is helpful"
"This exactly. He's been exploiting you, OP. Demand additional compensation immediately, including back pay, and if he doesn't give it to you, leave."
"It is fine. Stop going on about it or you will make it weird, he texted you this morning to check on you. You apologized and said your piece now drop it and plan your next date this guy still wants to be with you"
"So.... you want to marry a woman some day?

Because that's what will happen."
"You may want to check out r/polyamory for dating advice. It is a unique situation, but if you're up front and honest, there will be people who understand."
"&gt; suspected both at one time or another.

&gt;pro at gaslighting

WTF?  
why are you in this relationship?"
"Hm, it seems like you have no social clue. She told you that she doesn't want to hear from you. Just move on. It would be super creepy to ask her to unblock you."
"Her housing cost is the same. It's her INCOME that's higher.

If she earned the mortgage money through royalties from a book, something she also doesn't have to ""maintain"", you wouldn't be looking at this the same way at all, even though it's the same situation. You're basically saying ""She figured out a way to make her income cover her mortgage, and that makes me mad because it seems like less work than what I'm doing"".

Her job is actually very, very traditional - *landlord*."
"She's your ex.  Stop being a creeper and leave her alone.  See a counselor for your issues.  If she posted here about you contacting her to accuse her of cheating while you were together, I'd tell her to screenshot/save your texts, go to the police to report you as a potential stalker, and get some security cameras for her place.  

"
My mom named my brother after my father/grandfather/great-grandfather. She regrets it to this day. She says she wishes she could go back and just deal with the awkwardness of uncomfortableness of telling them it's not a tradition she wanted to carry on rather than getting pressured into it.

"Please go to the nearest hospital to the ER. They will care for you there. Reddit cannot help you in the way they can. They can connect you to all kinds of resources to help you too. But most importantly, they can help you right now when you most need it. So I'm urging you to please go the ER. "
"&gt; report the theft, but its unlikely you'll see the PS4 again.

There's still a good chance she can get it back. OP knows who has the PS4. Keeping stolen property is a no-no.

S has recourse to sue OP's brother for his money back, but he definitely doesn't get to keep the PS4."
"I don't think ""force"" is the word you mean here. "
"&gt; Most people do not have budgets so tight that they cannot wait one week for a friend to pay them back $10 or $20 

we're not talking about most people. we're talking about two people who were both too broke to pony up $10 in that particular week. it doesn't matter what ""most people"" have as their budget if it doesn't apply to OP.

&gt;  I'd be interested what agreement/arrangement OP and friend made about the food when he agreed to take the dog. If sorting out food was going to be such an imposition on OP, he should just not have agreed to care for the dog. 

i would as well. i presume he wouldn't have agreed if he thought she wouldn't be able to afford her dog's food, but there's no telling if he knew that'd be the case before he agreed to take the dog. he may have just agreed anyway to help her out in this moment of need, and didn't realize just how much difficulty their mutual lack of spare funds would cause. or they may have already had an agreement regarding the food, but due to extenuating circumstances she couldn't meet the agreement that week. again, though, it's simply speculation.

&gt; all the more reason she would be upset that dog food money that was supposed to last maybe a month or more has now been ""used up"" by OP in a week.

i understand that, but it's not his fault that he had to feed the dog with what was in his pantry. he still has to eat at some point, so he'd have to repurchase what was depleted. and i just don't think he should have to fund that himself when it's not his fault that the owner couldn't afford to feed her dog and he had to figure something out so her dog wouldn't starve. that's food he bought for himself, that he spent money on, that he should have been able to eat himself but could not. 

as an aside, assuming the bag of dog food is $10, $30 a week on food is not actually that ridiculous especially in some areas of the country (i'm guessing US or Canada here). you can definitely go cheaper, but OP didn't come here for meal planning advice.

(edit, again, because of word choice. i promise i'm not usually this much of a mess!)"
Stores won't return them if the Barcode is scribbled out. It's what food banks do. It means it's been donated.
"Not to mention that to be that much of an influence with *those* Target audiences, you really need to be top of your field already before you start."
"For a start, *you both need to be on the same page*.

Obviously that's an issue. Make clear where you stand with each other. Not together? You both act like you are while she says that you're not. Stop this. Sit down with her and make a decision. One or the other. You broke up, but carried on as if you haven't. *If this isn't a relationship stop treating it like one.* That is only going to bring more confusion and hurt, as if there hasn't been enough of that already."
"Even if I believe you that your boyfriend is just as insecure as you are, that just means you're both too immature for a relationship."
"He's not yours. You do not own him. He is not your thing. He is supposed to be your partner. Someone who brings joy to your life, but not the only source of joy. You don't let him, because it's not up to you who he has as friends. Does he know you've given him permission? Because he would probably be turned off if he knew this is the way you felt. ""Know how they can be"", so you believe women will manipulate your boyfriend, and you're claiming that's not sexist? When that's literally the definition of being sexist?

His female friends are not your competition. He chose you and actively chooses to be with you every day. Being around female or male friends doesn't change that. 

It doesn't matter if they flirt, also, are you ever around his female friends and him? It sounds like you've built up in your head these Hangouts. Tell him you want to get to know his friends, and you'll see they're not a threat. "
"It's your wedding. Plain and simple. It's your time to be happy. Best of luck, and congratulations! "
"Stand your ground. She will get over it in time. Your parents have no legal rights to your winnings. Your repaying the money you did was a kindness that they couldnt have forced in court. Your gift to your brother shows your a decent guy.   
Id have a discussion by phone with your pastor. Explain your mother had not discussed the donation with you before offering it and that she should not have done that as it was not hers to give. Let him know you have no intention of following through on her promise and encourage him to council your mother to accept this as you would hate for HIS church to become a dividing factor in your family.   
If he presses the matter, refuses to accept this....cut ties with your church....it already sounds as though you have concerns about the piety of this fellowship.  "
"His abusive personality doesn't disappear just like that. Chance are he'll be just as abusive towards her and it's unfortunate that there will be a Baby involved. There's always that possibility he has changed but we don't know that.

"I hope you have learned enough from this to not waste anothers persons time for so long. 

Learn what you want or else continue to be the asshole who experiments with other peoples lives."
"This, OP. Please listen. I'm a big proponent of getting plastic surgery - if it makes you feel better to look better, then go for it. But that's not what you'd be considering here. You'd be getting surgery solely for him, not for you - please **please** don't do that.

You're 24! You probably still look fantastic but your body changed because of a baby. For every nasty guy who has terrible comments to make like your husband, there are five others who would love your body and you. Your daughter is young but young enough where she starts to pick up on the dynamics of her house. Don't find ways to stay with this man, find ways to leave."
" Break up with her again, over text or something. If she threatens to self harm, call the police and tell them she's planning to kill herself. She'll be on the receiving end of a nice life lesson about not making terroristic threats to manipulate people when the police take her away for a weekend of involuntary commitment to a psychiatric facility. Or, she'll actually get some help she needs. In either case it's all upside for you. "
"When's the last time she's been to a doctor?   If she's markedly different in terms of paranoia and noise sensitivity (and you've been with her long enough to know) she needs to rule out anything physical.  

Figure out a way to sell it to her, say it might be a little much but it would make you feel better if she would just go rule out anything physical.  She might be more willing to go if you make an appointment too even if you don't need one.  Whatever you need to do or say, just get her in front of doctor.  In the small chance it is something like a tumor, she needs to know that NOW.

Once you rule that out, if it's truly a reaction to something at work, odds are good it'll fizzle out with time.  Don't drive yourself crazy trying to get info out of her, just try to give her some space to sort herself out.  If things get worse, you're not obligated to stay, but after 5 years and a proposal, you're obligated to try.  "
"I don't think you should. She lied to you and is still in contact with the guy, I don't see this working out. Block her on everything and move on."
"There's ""hypothetical bad situation"" like worrying that his plane will crash on the way there and he'll die, and there's ""hypothetical bad situation"" like 20 guys on a week-long coke bender surrounded by prostitutes end up having sex with them. One is a lot more likely than the other. "
"Yeah but this is a really embarrassing thing and I have told him multiple times in multiple ways. I dont think I have many more options.

"I think if you left this girl alone so she could find someone better suited for her and got yourself therapy, that would be the kindest thing possible. "
"Make a nice dinner for him, tell him you overreacted and that you appreciate his honesty and his openess about the whole situation and than leave it at that and have a good time with him and a nice sexy night in. And don't mention jen again, if he does don't react because you don't want him to start hiding things from you or to stop telling you what she does because he would be worried how you would react.

"^^^ This this this ^^^ Seeing this phrase on this sub drives me bananas! My partner is consistently loving and considerate, and we operate as a team, don't settle for less!"
"He probably feels resentful about the fact that he's the same as he was when you married him, but now you're angry at him for not changing just because you did. Go do the fun thing by yourself/just let him watch. If you're going to be pissy either way, you might as well have the experience of zip-lining by yourself rather than forever resent him for you missing your chance to zip-line just because you wanted to do it as a couple's activity. Do you remember ever feeling embarrassed or like a burden when you were obese? You're making your husband feel that way, the man you're supposed to love, who loved you when you were obese yourself. Did he take care of you and help you when you were recovering from surgery? Did you have any kind of productive discussions about him losing weight (and whether *he* wants to or you just want him to) and on what kind of time table? Or did you just say ""Hey, I want us to zipline so you'd better make sure you're under the weight requirement"" and then not follow up or check in until you were already there? It just sounds like you had this idea in your head that's important to you, but you're lacking in any planning or empathy that could help you not be resentful when you're supposed to be having fun."
"Same. My bf loves video games, but NEVER puts them before social events or plans with me, etc. And he's 11 years younger than OP's bf. "

No way, no couples counseling. 

Couples counseling is strongly advised *against* in abusive relationships. The abuser learns new ways to manipulate their partner. "

But that fight would be on her for crowbaring his feelings out of him then getting mad for having them.

"Of course not. Money and business first, humanity second. "
"There is a lot to unpack here. First of all: bless you for taking in this woman, and hopefully, her ex won't show up at your door to cause trouble. And also, hopefully, she doesn't end up going back to him. 

Your gf is thankful that you have rescued her sister, I'm sure she is. She is also dealing with conflicting emotions because her sister and she have a different bond than your gf would have with a roommate. She sees her sister getting parts of you that she wishes for herself. She is being honest about her emotions, and that's great, you two have good communication. 

Ask her what she would suggest as the best solution. It might be best if you didn't keep her sister as your roommate for an extended period, as well, as this could potentially lead to awkwardness between the two sisters. Someone who is coming out of a relationship also has the potential to rebound, and there are other emotions the sister is navigating coming out of an abusive relationship. She should get counseling, and also talk to an adviser at a domestic violence organization. 

Tell your gf that you appreciate and understand her feelings, validate them for her, because she is not wrong for feeling them. Continue communicating, and work on getting the sister to self sufficiency. Good luck.  "
"Do me a favour OP - you can't get that cash back, but please do everything you can to stop the trip. Cancel the tickets, cancel the hotel - anything. Because he morally stole that money right from you - what an absolute jerk."
"Why do people always say this in posts after OP says he knows it's cheating? 

He's not diminishing the cheating. He's trying to put it in a context where it's clear to his partner that it's less likely to be a recurring event. That's a reasonable approach, assuming doing too much acid is not a recurring event for him from now on. "
"Of course you can dance together at a work event off the clock. I'm not telling you to be Amish unless you're in a bedroom. I'm just saying that on the clock is a no go. And at a work event is minimal, professional affection. But just realize the less professional you are, the more gossip you risk. I'm not saying none. Just be professional. 

Think of it like alcohol. No go on the clock. And at work events off the clock you may partake. But you remain in control and professional. You don't get raging wild drunk. 

Other than that you can take a risk with HR and see if their intervention helps. But it also might not. I don't know your HR or the employees who gossip, so I couldn't say either way."
"It's so insane to me that he can be ""too proud"" to collect benefits to pay the bills while unemployed, but not too proud to steal the rent money from his girlfriend to go on a vacation instead."
"You need to tell him what you overheard and talk to him about it.  You can't let it go, but you probably don't want to just hastily break up over it. Talk about it.  See what he says.  See how you feel about his answers.  Figure it out from there. "
"No, you don't have to be sad for the rest of your life, but if you want anything to change, you need to be proactive about your situation. How are you managing your depression? Anyway, I think the issue is two-fold: depression and the general difficulty in forming relationships after your mid-20s. 

Regarding depression: I tend to get into similar slumps myself. It can be hard. I usually crawl out by making an effort to stay active, through exercise and just going out, even if I am going out alone for an event. It takes a lot of willpower, but you can take small steps. Make a goal of one new event or activity every week. Taking care of yourself is paramount if you're not already doing so.

Regarding relationships: it can be difficult to find genuine human interaction, even if you have a lot of interests. Try and figure out what kind of person you'd like to be friends with, and then think about where you would encounter such a person. If you have a specific interest, try and engage in that somehow in your city or community."
"It might not have registered in his mind if you hadn't previously discussed it that you would have wanted to celebrate. Is he like this with other holidays? If this was your birthday or Christmas, I'd be very upset personally. He should have nudged your stepson to get you a card but unless you'd discussed it he may not have thought about it."
"Yeah-- in the description, he was hiding alcohol abuse from me for a year while I was pregnant/on maternity leave"
"Hold on and speak with your counselor.

Talking about your needs and wants from the relationship is completely legitimate, but telling her that she *should* feel exploited is not helpful or constructive. She probably feels she's making an investment that will pay out in the future and you sound like you're calling her stupid and naive. That would make anyone defensive. 

Regardless of who is right, you need to alter your approach to these problems. No matter what mistakes she is making, your judgement, score-keeping and growing resentment will not make problem solving easier. Take a deep breath and try to minimize your assumptions and be open to many possible solutions when you go into therapy."
"&gt;She said the timing was bad, which I already knew, and that she isn't looking for a relationship right now.

This is a clear response. This isn't vague or ambiguous, this is clear. She is saying no to being with you. She is just being nice about it. 

I mean, she's seen you smash things and threaten suicide when another girl you liked didn't reciprocate your feelings: do you think maybe she's afraid that a similar thing could happen to her if she wasn't careful about how she framed her rejection? Even now, she has told you clearly that she doesn't want to be in a relationship, and you are still trying to think of ways she isn't *really* saying no, and *maybe* if you turn on the charm, *maybe* if strangers on the internet say something different...

Let her go."
"Totally agree. And furthermore, that kind of bullshit is what makes a lot of employers hesitant to offer that option to their employees at all. People with no integrity abuse it. "
Because that's where realization kicks in the face
"you took a kid on a date to mcdonalds, ice cream and a playground and you don't see any correlation huh?"
"&gt; it's so painfully obvious which one he prefers.

How is it obvious? Did he say it? Did he say that he prefers it? Because if he didn't then, I am sorry, but no, it's not obvious at all. It just looks more fun for people who are not like that."
"I help my mom and dad out with computer stuff and the biggest thing that helped me? I don't help over the phone. It's hard enough to do that with someone who understands computers. It's impossible with elderly people. Plus, as you're seeing, being available over the phone means you are 24/7 tech service. Unless it's something simple like telling my mom to unplug the router and plug it back in, I simply tell her it has to wait until I can come over. Probably tomorrow or the next day. 

It's not your job, it's his. He agreed to do it from home, so he has to figure out how to make that work."
"Hopefully, that's the LAST time you go to your BF's place because that is NOT normal behavior. 

Let your friend group know what happened. so others can be on guard for this kind of behavior from this guy."
It's theft and property damage though. She did say these plants were rare and very expensive.
Also this was all planned by my husband without checking in with me first... it would of not been my first choice of spending long weekend 
"This is all that matters:

&gt;We made it clear ""three or four nights a week, no showering or laundry"" before she moved in.

and they appear to be sticking to that agreement.

Yeah, he sounds like someone you might not want in your life. But you don't get to screen everyone that your roommate, who pays her rent and sticks to the agreed upon guidelines, brings home. Just because you're uncomfortable with him as a person doesn't mean you can forbid her from bringing him over. He's not bringing his craziness into your home, he's not abusing your utilities or food, he's not causing noise or disturbances: he's just there.

You can reiterate the rules about 3-4 nights per week. But beyond that you just have to suck it up. If you're going to sublet, you might have guests that you wouldn't normally befriend, but that doesn't mean you can ask them not to come over without reason.


If you want to give her *relationship* advice on these problems:

&gt;I personally don't get a truthful vibe from him. I kinda believe he stole money (he has no job) and he cheated on her (they are so mis-matched and she has complained to me he disappeared on her a few times). How can I get her to maybe start to see the forrest for the trees? My heart breaks for her because...I also wasted my time on a liar when I was young and I wish I had someone who was able to get through to me.

Then that's a different matter. But you still can't forbid him from coming over/restrict access just because *you* feel he's a bad apple. That's incredibly judgmental and waaaaaay overstepping your boundaries as her landlord."
"The worst part is we are great friends. We get along great! we share the same ideals and beliefs for the most part and have amazing conversations when we don't. He just doesn't fulfill me when it comes to the romantic part of the relationship. I just worry that I will potentially lose something that /for the most part/ is pretty great in search for something that is missing and never actually find it. Or find someone who says and does all the right romantic type stuff but then isn't that great friend I want to spend every day with.

3rd option....open relationship? lmao, jk (...sort of?)"
"Hmm. Tough one. Hard not to dwell on it. I don't have much advice but I guess I was wondering if he is trying to fix the damage? Or does he think you should just move on? If he is pressuring you to be ""ok"" with it, when you aren't, that needs to stop. He broke your trust."
"Your parents cut up their good parenting  cards years ago. Just because they're family, doesn't mean you need to interact with them, you already had a clue how they'd react to your engagement via your oldest sister. Cut them off, and get counseling. Eventually you will feel blessed relief from their toxicity. "
"Doesn't sound like OP wants that at all.  Sounds like he just wants to do what's best for the kid, including stepping back if necessary; he's just confused right now."
"I don't think I ever implied you have self esteem issues. 

You speak in a lot of absolutes. This ALWAYS happens, that NEVER happens. That tends to eliminate a lot of potential from human interaction. Every person you encounter is a unique human being, so always &amp; never tend to box things in &amp; eliminate everything else. Also, I'm a woman &amp; approached my now-husband before he approached me. So your statement that this ""never works"" is already disproved by a single example, &amp; you're ruling out every other guy in existence that would be receptive to being approached based on that statement. 

It kind of seems like you're already decided that you're going to be alone forever. People are offering advice here, &amp; you're rejecting it. I get that you're venting here, but you do come across as a very closed off person. You've already decided everything, you've already tried everything. Your exchanges with people here aren't give-and-take conversation. You're not receptive to what others have to say. If you're at all like this in person, that could be why you're not getting results. "
"congratulations, you are dating a racist.

what you do depends on whether you are happy to continue a relationship with a racist."
"A marriage is a contract. A marriage with an immigration process is an even bigger contract. A prenup is the pre contractual agreement to set you both up for the best success. Tons of adults craft them without the drama that you have encountered. It sounds like in the discussion it raised some red flags. The fact that she moved out without telling you and cut contact for a month is a HUGE flag. 


Postpone the wedding. Especially because of the immigration status. If you get married and then have to divorce its going to be a long drawn out legal battle and you're going to face an inquiry. Couples and financial counseling if you still want to go through with this before you do anything else. "
It's like they don't comprehend the V needs to also be wiped.. 
"When I was 15 or so, I flew to New Hampshire to visit my LD GF of the time(met through Xbox live). She broke up with me 12 hours of my arrival, but I was stuck there for a little more than a week. She felt guilty, and I took advantage of that to coerce her into touching me sexually. I said similar things as Tom, ""but you said you would like to have sex"", ""you said you loved me not 24 hours ago"". 

That was so obviously wrong of me. She wasn't ""into it"". There's no way to justify something like that. I don't know how one could downplay something like that. It IS abuse. And OP, IMO, you should drop him if he can't come to realize how fucked what he did to Vanessa was. 

He bullied her into it even after she explicitly withdrew her consent. Had he told you about it from a point of guilt, knowing he had done wrong and showing remorse, I'd argue for a bit of lenience but not blame you if you couldn't move past it. But for him to justify it by saying he was just a horny teen? That's like saying marital rape is okay because the consent is implied.

I wouldn't even bother trying to to lecture Tom, because its HE who has to realize he was sexually abusive, and if he hasn't been able to realize that in the 8 years since, then I'm pretty sure he'll never realize it.

There's a part of me that realizes its rich of me to say these things, its just upsetting that he doesn't realize did something very wrong.

"
"You're being super selfish honestly. 5-6 days a week is basically everyday and even if you're in your room for the most part, it's still another person in the house and a male who your roommate really doesn't know.  I would be super uncomfortable too if I was your roommate and think you're hella rude. "
"Just out of curiosity, how much do you invest on him/the relationship? Are you just as frugal or are you a lot more generous?"
"And the scripts they are following when you don't want to pay are so emotionally charged and dramatic, it's ridiculous. We have this charity nearby that claims they help people with autism. Their members knock at my door at least twice a month. Every fucking time when I say I won't give them any money each and every one of these annoying minions goes ""OH?! IS THAT SO?! I see, YOU think people with autism SHOULDN'T BE HELPED!"". Yeah, be rude, shout in my face and misinterpret my words, that will change my mind. Now, I got annoyed even writing about it..."

"I don't see this ending well.

Why is that a double standard... in many places smoking is illegal while drinking isn't. 
"The weirdest part for me was when he went from insisting you were murdered, to insulting and threatening you, and then back to asking if you were alive/worrying you'd been murdered.

That's some next level inconsistency. Scary."
"Oh my god, DO NOT SAY ANYTHING. If my boyfriend approached me about finding out that I watch porn/what type I would watch I'd be mortified. Her watching porn alone is incredibly private, and really you shouldn't have gone through her browsing history like that even if you guys do have each other's pass codes. Pretend you never say it and try to forget it. "

"I mean, I totally get wanting to help a teen out who has been kicked out by their family. I just worry about the pressures and social aspects for the daughter. Like she might not feel free to break up with him because he lives with her. She's awfully young for the role of live-in gf, too. There's a lot that goes into that that most 16 yr olds don't have to deal with. Not just about sex, although I certainly don't love the idea of them sharing a bed/room, either! 20 is old enough to start fending for himself. "
""" Shouldn't he be concerned that I'm dissatisfied?""

YES HE SHOULD!! If I or my partner want to try something new together we *at the very least* give it a try to make the other happy, his total unwillingness to care about your satisfaction is more than enough grounds to break up "
"I think that it's always happened- there are some people who like to be busy and surrounded by people, and others who don't.  One of my aunts was born in the 40s and she was always thought a big 'odd' that when she got spare time she'd read or paint or something solitary.  Growing up I'd rather read than just about anything, and I'd go to work in the 80s and people would be asking what my husband and I did, and we'd say ""read, watch movies"".   If anything I think that there might be more of an understanding now that some people are just kind of introverts/quiet.  And a lot of those Pinterest/Instagram people etc. are doing things (food, crafts, arts) that specifically require them to stay at home for long periods of time- they've just found a way to make it work for them. "
"Oh that's cool, so it's OK for her to sleep around but not for you? For some reason you don't get to ""enjoy  freedom while you're young"" but she does? You should be thankful that she was honest with you, but ultimately she has told you that getting strange dick is more important to her than being in a monogamous, *equal* relationship with you. Wish her well and get out of her life."
"&gt;nothing I said seemed to make any difference. She had already decided even before our conversation last week that we were breaking up. She never even tried to come to me to talk about it before she made her decision and by the time we did talk about it, it was too late, she wasn't going to change her mind

I think she's already answered your ""do I fight for this"" question, hasn't she?

Sometimes breakups don't make sense, and they always hurt. But think about it this way: would you really want to be with someone you have to beg to reconsider and stay with you? Wouldn't you always be waiting for the other shoe to drop?

Better off just taking her at her word and moving forward. "
"I know people like this.   Everything is a joke to them and they don't know how to be serious or when I'm not in the mood for jokes and I tell them pretty point blank, ""hey don't say that.  Don't call me that.""  

Whoooosh "
She's making the relationship great again.  But Op should run. This is only going to get worse.
As others have said she's not interested and this makes it plainly obvious. It's not just sex it's obviously anything sexual. So she is likely either asexual or a lesbian and doesn't realize it. 
"Prank or not, he's not sympathizing with you. He's laughing at you. Personally I wouldn't deal with that shit and I'd be out."

"I would also feel weird and gross and confused if I saw those photos as a kid. I think you should talk this through with a therapist and get it off your chest, since it's messing with your life. I don't think you are overreacting or anything. They sound like good people though so it's worth addressing the anger before it really damages your relationship."
"So I rang him and broke up with him. He was distraught. Crying over the phone, it's the first time I've seen him have emotion. Oh well, onwards and upwards! Don't have time for cheaters! "
"What I'm about to write is going to shock some folks, Im sure- but here goes: 
Throw out (this is an edit: Don't throw them away. I mean SWITCH out) his ill- fitting clothes and replace them with clothes that fit. Don't do all of them at once, just try a couple items. A too- short blue shirt for an extra- length blue shirt. The wrong- sized underwear for the right-sized underwear.. like that. Get the same brand, the same style if you can, or as close as possible. Put the original items somewhere else, maybe, just in case he NEEDS them for some reason. My grandmother did that with my grandfather. My mother did it with my father. I did it with my husband. IF they noticed at all (big ""if""), they'd say either they thought they lost weight or want to know if we washed their stuff differently. Sometimes we came clean, sometimes we didn't. If they didn't ask, we didn't tell. 

None of them really cared, is the thing. They didn't care either way, they just didn't want to buy clothes. They wanted to look decent, they just didn't want to have to DO anything for it to happen. Of course, everyone has their favorite t shirt or shorts or whatever- don't fuck with the favorites. 

I mean, you could just try it.  Also, I buy extra long t shirts off Amazon. "
"Some people, especially teens, when they hear that there will be consequences in the distant future, don't care. You could tell her that you are cutting off the phone bill TODAY. She needs to find a job yesterday. Until she finds a job she is expected to do chores or something and then when she finds a job she has to pay for rent and food and anything else she wants. If she doesn't cooperate by doing the chores (such as cooking or doing dishes) you and your husband could go out to dinner alone without her, forcing her to feed herself, refuse to do her laundry for her, etc. "
Definitely a southern thing. Every old southern woman I know still calls their parents mama and daddy. My mom also refers to my dad as daddy when she is talking to me. 
"Your parents are not your children's parents.

You and your wife also need to be a united front with your children and discipline. Otherwise you risk your wife becoming the ""mean parent"" and you becoming the ""pushover"""
"So you never, ever, in  your whole life, made a mistake or had a brain fart? Kudos."

"Have you asked his doctors about an insulin pump? Continuous glucose monitor? 

The burden your wife has taken on is not sustainable, and this sounds more like a manifestatIon of anxiety than medical necessity. You guys need to work with his doctors and a counselor to change this. You absolutely have to take on some of this burden so your wife can relax, and you need to come up with medical solutions that let you live a life as normal as possible."
"Here's the thing: you knew he wasn't in a place to contribute financially when you bought the furniture. You bought it on your own. You rented the place and moved in on your own. This is YOUR apartment and it's YOUR stuff.

If you had've agreed before you bought it all that he would split the costs when he did have the money or unless you both had an agreement in place that you would pay for everything now and he would pay you back you're kinda stuck.

I think that telling him after the fact that he owes you x amount for all the shit you bought is really low.  "
"Yes this is exactly it. I think that's why I'm struggling. I need to reconcile my being glad she's not obsessed with her appearance with wanting to ""improve"" her appearance. I think that greasy/clean hair is different from jeans and T shirts/latest fashion though."
"I agree, too wordy. A simple ""how do I fix this?"" would have been enough."
"That's a bummer, but you have explained what happened and she's not willing to forgive you, I think it maybe time to move on. 

Let her live her life and you live yours, sure one day you two could reconnect but don't live hoping that you two will. 

This situation maybe easier for you to move on with than it is for her, or maybe she likes the dramatics of it all, who knows. 

It's gonna suck for awhile, but it will get better!!"
I'm still trying to find out how that makes someone a cheater...
"But OP didn't post on social media but on anonymous fora. She might has well have posted on r/relationships. If anything, asking strangers for advice seems less gossipy to me than discussing the situation with friends, and I don't see why it should be wrong to want some external input about personal relationships that you find to be difficult? If that was such a bad thing, this entire subreddit would mostly be obsolete. Unless you referred to OPs friend as the one who is posting behind her back on social media, since that is basically what is happening here."
"&gt;focus all your energy on bringing her down. 

Contradicts

&gt;Don't waste your precious energy on her. 

The first is terrible advice. Focusing on bringing her down might be initially bitterly satisfying but ultimately it's not healthy and not a good way to get this horrible person out the door and OP on the way to recovering himself. OP, follow the second statement and rip off the band aid, cut her loose. Don't waste any more of your life on someone who treats you with such contempt."
I think u/StardustSapien is just trying to be nice
"Just on a practical level: if you are anxious, it may be physically hard to swallow. Grab some quality protein powder and throw it into a blender with some frozen or fresh fruit, milk or soy milk. Add yogurt too. Smoothies are a good way to take in nourishment. You can sip on it bit by bit. It goes down easier. 

Experiment with adding things like honey, peanut butter, or Nutella with chocolate flavored protein powder. Vanilla powder with mango and a bit of cinnamon is delicious. 

If you aren't taking in enough energy, that exacerbates the emotional problems. "
"&gt; She will stop washing my clothes (as I dont have a washer/dryer at my home, she usually comes and picks up the laundry for me).

You are 30 years old. Do your own laundry."
"Been there.

At 29, this is her, this is how she is. This will never, ever, ever change, whatever you do or say. No deal, bargain, threat, plea... nothing. As you say, she SIMPLY DOES NOT SEE IT, and that cant even  be learned or trained, you need to treat it as a legit form of blindness. I've encountered it over and over.

So, either learn to live with it, or break up. I absolutely guarantee 100% that nothing whatsoever will change this. This is surprisingly common, and surprisingly resistant to cure."
"Congratulations on taking control of your life and making the changes necessary to ensure you had the ability to follow through with your dreams and goals!

You have shown an incredible level of maturity and forthright reflection of your current situation and how to step away from unhealthy entanglements.

You keep right on stepping!"
"I'm not becoming an illegal immigrant, I am using a J-1 Au Pair visa from which most girls apply for longer and residency :) USA is actually the biggest hirers of Au Pairs particularly from South Africa :) I am going through an agency that is very well known and a good process through lots of security checks. Thank you for the concern though! :)"
"I cannot upvote this enough. I was in a relationship with my first boyfriend for 7 years (from 18 to 25) and we had lived together for 5 of those years. Went through a lot, he supported me when my dad died and in my career and I supported him when he had issues with his family, finances and his studies. At no point had he ever brought up any doubts, we never had substantial fights or talks that indicated that he was falling out of love. Heck, we were even looking at houses with extra bedrooms because we had discussed having kids.  

Then he went on a 2 week camp with the scoutstroop he was leading, he came back and dropped the bomb on me that he did not love me anymore and hadn't for a long time. Packed his things and left, wrote me a long message detailing all the things that went wrong in his eyes (none of which were ever discussed) and refused to talk to me about why or when this happened. Later I found out through mutual friends and his family that he had discussed things with other people, but never with me - the person who could have maybe solved some of those things had they been discussed in time  

I felt like I had been punched in the gut, I felt like my life and everything in it (our friends and families were so intertwined) were crumbling before my eyes and I felt like I had no chance to fix it, no chance to talk about things, no chance to leave on my terms (as children is something I really wanted/want).  

It felt like the ultimate betrayal of my best friend, the person closest to me and it made me doubt our whole relationship - had he ever been honest? Had he ever felt the love for me that I still felt for him?  

At first I tried to bargain, tried to talk to him and get his reasons foolishly thinking we were at the bump in the road - when reality set in that he had been at that bump ages ago but had just not told me and started closure a long time ago that hurt even more.  

I took it upon myself to write goodbye letters to the people that I cared about and made a very harsh and definite exit because I needed to heal. It took me a long time to get over that and it took me even longer to start to trust people for their word.  

Luckily, my story has a good ending. A year and a couple months later I met an amazing man and have found a great love again in my life. Now I can look back on that first relationship and appreciate it for what it was and how it helped me grow and even think back at that first guy with fondness, but in my moments of weakness I still feel terrified that the same thing will happen with my current SO and I work on that daily."
"&gt; Dude, you can't use ""That's costly"" as a reson for her not to change, then say to OP to change.

She's not bothered about them having the same name, he is bothered. Makes sense that if it's expensive, you suggest that the one who really cares about it take on the cost rather than the one who doesn't want to do it."
"Your sister is getting to be the age where relationships change and become nuanced. Transitioning from childhood ""playmate"" relationships where the connection is based off of shared interests or activities to a base of emotional connection. She is naturally going to pursue relationships with greater emotional depth, some of them will be bad for her.

Watch Mean Girls with her. Have popcorn, make a thing of it. Don't lecture her about her friend, joke with her about how you had a shitty Regina George friend when you were 13 and didn't realize how awful she was. If you, as the cool older sister, connect with her she on this it will plant a seed in her head. Showing her that you've dealt with crappy people, that you don't tolerate people that don't respect you, that bullying is 100% out of line, etc will let her know that she can talk to you about this stuff."
Yeah it sucked for my da who had 3 boys to take care of and explain what their mother did. He's been searching for me ever since he could but until recently he never found me.im his daughter btw
"It sounds like you might have a bit of a Dominant/Submissive relationship with your girlfriend. That's totally cool, but with any power exchange relationship you need to make sure that your communication is open and honest. 

Being bossed around by a hot girl may seem fun but if she takes it too far and you start to resent it, that's bad news. For her, she may become emotionally exhausted being dominant and 'in charge' of you. She may not feel like she can show her vulnerability if she's trying to be a 24/7 Domme.

So... enjoy, but make sure it's healthy and happy for both of you."
"She is going to annoy the absolute hell out of her friends and family members until she realizes that she will never make any money with it.  Seriously, nobody that I know can stand that shit.  It is beyond irritating.  Constant facebook posts and pressure to attend ""parties""...no, just no.  Your girlfriend is becoming *that* girl, and it is not a good thing.  She'll probably inevitably lose a couple of friends over this. She'll spend way more than she makes to boot.  

I really think that you should get a few people to sit down with her and explain it more clearly.  I hate these companies so much.  I don't care how good their products are, they are disgusting scam artists, the lot of them"
"&gt; The tip of the iceberg was when he was telling my son how much he wanted me to be there, and how it won't be fun without me but It was my decision not to go....again making me the bad guy ,and seeing the disappointment in my son's eyes just broke my heart.

He is using your son as a pawn to manipulate you.  He is hurting your son,  hurting your son's relationship with you,  and putting your son in the middle of an adult disagreement. That is so many levels of toxic. 

Hard no. That is completely unacceptable."
She would rather put the burden on someone else or tax payers than provide for a child she CHOSE to bring into this world. 
Good on him for breaking up with you. He shouldn't be with someone who hits him then laughs about it with her friends. Leave him alone. 
"Even if it didn't you were still being blatantly childish, mean-spirited, and honestly just plain crazy - and even trying to strike someone is emotionally abusive at the very least.  

He has every reason to leave you.  "
"You are 100% right -- if their plan for raising a biracial child is to put their head in the sand and pretend that race doesn't exist, they are NOT the right parents for your child. 

The first thing you do is to tell your GF that you are not going to agree to adopt to this family, and ask her if she'd like to tell the adoption agency or if she'd like you to. (There is no reason for you to tell the potential parents directly, that's the agency's job). You don't need to turn this into a fight. Stay calm and say that this is not a decision she can make unilaterally, and you don't like these parents. 

Moving forward, I'm as concerned about the fact that she ""made"" the decision without your consent as I am with the parents you choose. Legally it's a non starter, as any adoption requires your approval. But relationship-wise, it's also a red flag. Make sure you goal is to do what's best for you child and for yourself, even if that means some people get upset. "
"Honestly it seems like you're some kind of consolation prize to him. I'd dump him. You deserve to find someone who loves you, only you, and that wouldn't leave you for nothing in this world. "
It isn't unheard of for food stamp recipients to sell their benefits for cash. It's fraud and the government does care about that.  A lot.

"Perhaps he is in a bit of a shock you would do something like that, and it is too much for him to handle? It is possible that self-harm is a level of mental health illness he is not prepared to deal with in a relationship. What you did is just a step away from him coming home and finding you dead. It is such a horrifying thought. He may be very angry with you at the moment for doing that, and doesn't want to come and see you angry because he knows it wouldn't be helpful. He is likely shocked with what you've done and what could've happened, and his first impulse is not to come and protect you, but to withdraw. His impulse may change after he's processed it, but be prepared that this may be a deal breaker for him, and also consider if his reaction is a deal breaker for you. 

In all honesty, if you are at the self-harming stage, you should really focus on yourself and your mental health, be kind to yourself and not worry about him at the moment. Speak to your parents or friends instead. "

"Do it.

It's unhealthy if you start making your life revolve around it and turn it into an obsession. But if you can remain cool, collected, and detached as you go through the process, then I don't see any reason why you shouldn't. It's not wrong or vindictive to want someone to stop forcing other people to bear the burden of their responsibilities. All of the things you learned in therapy are good and true, but they pertain to dealing with a situation you cannot fix or control. If you are now in a position to make a material difference without putting yourself at emotional risk, I don't believe it's necessary to abstain. 

In all honesty, if it were me, I would consider it unhealthy to NOT do this if I had the chance and was reasonably sure of success. (I wouldn't do it if it was going to be a long, drawn-out, endless slog with iffy chances of collecting at the end.) He got away with skirting his responsibilities for years and then on top of that kept trying to meddle in his children's lives and careers. Now you've won another judgment against him that he also has no intention of paying. You think he's going to start behaving himself and back off? Hit him where it hurts and maybe make him feel consequences for once in his life. It's not always a virtue to let people just get away with doing awful things."
"He's asking a lot of you, to move across country with him. You are not asking a lot of him in return -- an engagement. If he can't commit to you in the same way he's asking you to commit to him, well, is he worth being with? 

Yes, you love him. But think about this practically for a moment."
"&gt; I probably would have started looking for another job

This guy has done you a huge favour. He mentioned a potential conflict and now your boss has approached you to get your input to deal with it.

But you say you'd prefer if he said nothing at all, allowed you two to just work there together without warning you and you say you'd probably want to leave your job because of it? That is mental. There is no logic there. "
This relationship doesn't sound healthy. He shouldn't be calling you names and using the fact that you are in counseling against you like that. His defensive reaction really calls into question his intentions. 
"&gt; he lets me do whatever I want

That you phrase it this way is worrying in itself. It sounds like he and/or you believe that he has the ability and the right to stop you from going out with friends, he just chooses not to exercise that right. That's a big ol' red flag. "
"Saw your edit where you said the family doesn't care about money and has spent thousands on you so far in food, clothing, etc which is obviously going above and beyond what 99.9% of families would do for their 20 year old son's girlfriend.

So if you're so adamant it's not about money then can't you just accept that they don't want you on family vacations and respect that? Like give them ONE thing that is their own, especially as you're already invited to holidays so obviously it's not that you're shunned? Why do you have to be in EVERYTHING?"
"Not really, no. You want a family, this is as close as you're going to get for now. 

Don't you understand that you've been incredibly lucky already? You spend a lot of time at their house, you watch movies with them, go out to eat, invited to holidays, **his mom even includes you in Mother's Day**, they've spent thousands on you in clothes and food.

None of that is required for any family to extend to a son's girlfriend. You're literally in every part of their life except for their vacations. If it's not about the money then they're not inviting you because they don't want to. That's completely up to them and completely fair. 

When you're complaining about this one last thing, you sound incredibly entitled and whiny. And intruding on what they've made clear is their one boundary for family time - their own vacations. Seriously everything that they do for you is above and beyond what families usually do for their son's girlfriends... and you are incredibly integrated considering how young you guys / your relationship is. "
You have only been with this guy since August 2016 and he's your husband? 
that was my thinking! i didn't want to reference that in case op hadn't seen it but it really sounds exactly like that!
A false mistaken case of Mr. F?

"I'm guessing you have maybe three family members and they just don't share their health conditions. You could be a genetic ticking time bomb, while she could live to be 100. Your grasp of health issues is startlingy poor. "
yeah... that's a good plan. And he has said he won't eat anymore food when he comes over if I'd like him to pay for my food when we go out. I wish it didn't have to come to that though. I'd like to be able to share with him and have him be thoughtful or considerate enough to offer to pay for my food when we go out. 
"You aren't overreacting, you're laying down the goddamn law. "
I think everyone agrees with this. But I'm advising OP to take some time to think before making this decision. 
"Out of all the relationships I've seen ""taking a break"" (a handful of friends over the years) it was always synonymous with ""too chickenshit to really break up"". They never got back together.

Now I won't say it never works because I'm sure a handful of people have experiences where it has. But you're 18 and you've been having a lot of fights, why do you want this negativity and drama in your life?

There are millions of people you can date who you're compatible with, people at your age rarely find the person they spend the rest of their life with.

He should tell her what he feels. But if she doesn't want to change then he should just get over himself. It's that simple.
"Hey, not sure if this is what you mean, but I have an anxiety disorder and sometimes it feels like I'm deliberately pursuing thoughts that upset me because there's also a weird kind of pleasure in it. CBT has helped. A lot. "
But she's joined a website where she's meeting like minded people and where they CAN ACCESS IMAGES OF VIOLENCE! I think that's scary. What the fuck is this website? a website to help each other dissolve these thoughts or a website to encourage potential harmers?
"It is actually. You have no right to tell her when to work. People don't have to accommodate to you at all. Everyone that I know who are light sleepers do what normal people do, find their own ways to deal with it. Live on the top floor next time if you are so entitled and can't adapt. Get over yourself. "
Because it's his mommy dearest. 
I feel so bad for him. I've never heard something so insensitive as this. I would not be surprised if he ended things with her. That had to be so emotionally suffocating to him.

Father is enabling shitty wife. Enablers are a problem. 
You should definitely let her go so that she can date someone who isn't an asshole.
"Take it from an oldie, if you can't have interesting conversations with your partner, it soon gets very stale (and frustrating). I know stuff my husband doesn't know, but he also knows stuff I don't know. He explains things to me if I'm feeling like I want to learn, I do the same for him. 

Apart from that, it helps if your core values align. I know there's lots of happy couples with very different political/religious/social justice stances, but it's so much easier when you both have similar views!

I don't think it sounds at all that you have over-high expectations. When you're talking about finding someone to share your whole life with, you have to be able to grow together from common ground."

"My problem with it is that it will confuse my daughter. After the girlfriend I mentioned in my post and I split...my daughter cried almost daily because she missed my ex girlfriends kids.You don't see any problem at all with getting attached to people and then them leaving? You must have been super hardcore if it didn't bother you at all to get to know somebody in that capacity and then as soon as you get to know them so well and get used to seeing them all the time and not caring when they left for no reason.  And speaking of awesome mom...that is another huge issue I have with it. My daughter's mom is a pretty good mom when she is single. But when she starts dating these guys..at the very first sign of it turning the slight but serious...these boyfriends take priority over literally everything else. And it is usually me who gets to explain why Mommy isn t picking her up again today even though its Froday and she knows it is a ""Mommy Day"". And not that I don't love having my daughter all the time...but its hard to plan anything at all. Because you literally never know when Mommy is gonna call and have some sort of ""emergency""'. These emergencies very very rarely happen when she is single. You can downplay it all you want...But there is a reason that all these psychologists and courts and books preach stability in a young child's life. If she were a teenager I can honestly say I wouldn't give a shit. But she is 5. And even though you turned out great...I don't want to just cross my fingers and hope that it doesn't screw with her head once she gets attached to this guy and this guys daughter and then things don't work out."
"Your lack of remorse is a little weird. Did you not grow up in a stable, loving family unit?

You don't owe his wife or kids anything, but most people do not conscientiously engage in behavior that will potentially cause *kids* lifelong emotional trauma.

"Are you telling your mother that she's talking to the wrong person? Is there a reason your mother can't tell your brother herself? She's getting a new roommate, it feels like to her, without being asked here - all the psychology questions aside, that in itself could be annoying. Your brother doesn't pay anything and his GF is gradually becoming more present here... I'd think that at his age he would recognize the possible issue here. I dunno. I want to say, tell him he needs to talk to mom, but ehhhh."
"First off, he needs to stop giving drugs to underage kids. Regardless of your thoughts on pot, it's wrong to do and illegal even in places where normal pot use isnt. 

Second, could you convince the bil that if he reports it, you'll just take the blame? I'm not saying you should actually do it,but would it scare him off?"
"Tell you what you want to hear is exactly what he's doing. Your keep question why he wouldn't just be up front. 

Because you're friends are correct and he's just not s good person. The evidence is right in front of you. He doesn't want to take the risk of being honest and getting rejected. It's much easier to lead you on a bit, get a sense of how into him you are and then walk away when he gets what he wants. "
"So, not new behaviour then, but behaviour that he's only recently made clear that it doesn't matter how much it upsets you, or how precious the situation, or how reasonable your requests are, he will not respect you or your boundaries.

Marriage counselling, yes, but be aware that he's already given you a fairly hard and fast answer, which is that he's not going to so much as modify his behaviour for anyone, fuck you for asking, and have a side of emotional manipulation just for funsies. So there's little a therapist will be able to do other than validate that you're the reasonable one here, but honestly? He knows that already. It's not impacted his behaviour anyway. Likely, therapy won't cause him to change. 

And only you can answer the shout of 'if this is who he is and he's not going to improve and these events will keep repeated themselves, do I want to stay married to him?' 

(Something to bear in mind: This sort of shit rarely exists ins a vacuum. He may very well have abusive tendencies, in which case all counselling is going to do is teach him new ways to control you. If, after 3 months of therapy with him, you actually feel *worse* but can't put your finger on why? Run, and run hard.)"
African immigrants too! Lol
Why doesn't he text and let her know he was going to be late? 
"Don't listen to this guy. He's probably a domestic abuser himself, judging by his response. It's admirable that you are willing to let go of a friendship for your gf and for something you feel strongly about. All I see is that you uphold your values and won't associate with someone who doesn't and that's the beauty of life, we get to decide who we want to be friends with or not. "
"Dude... I made this mistake... I more or less, acquiesced to something similar for the very same reason she gave... We're young let's be young and free... I expressed the same sentiment as you, and she pressed me to make the decision, and it ended. After, I just felt I couldn't trust her, and it sucked to be with her because of the lack of trust. 

So, if this (open relationships) isn't your bag, end it. "
"Don't ever, ever try and convince a woman to stay with you. Let her go. She ain't happy with you, despite how happy you are with her. Be a gentleman, accept the breakup, and wish her the best. Relationships are beautiful when they are mutual. "

"I feel like I can give some real perspective here as the vast majority of my friends work in film (in a small city) and I've dated many a film guy. He sounds like a classic stereotype of a guy working in film right down to the slamming doors and smoking more. 

Of everyone I know who works in film only *ONE* person has managed to make a relationship with someone outside of film work. As you said, the hours and insularity make it super difficult, but the money means that he will likely work in film the rest of his life. I've never known anyone to pick up and head to a different industry, especially not if they've joined the union or gotten their days to become an AD or a Best Boy. 

SO unless you're comfortable with this being your life, I'd leave now before you waste any more of your time. He's embedded in this industry and will ultimately end up with someone else who also works in that carnie-like environment. Even if you stay the likelihood of him cheating is very, very high. Film sets are a very intimate environment and long hours and after-wrap drinks make it very easy to catch feelings for someone else.

"He could find a place that serves it, or he could make it himself. Hell, sounds like he didn't even bother googling ""gumbo"" to confirm that yes, that's a thing he wanted to try... That level of intellectual engagement is not too much to expect from a damn adult.

However, acting on it *is* creepy IMO, not a boundary in willing to cross, but something I...Fantasize about?"
"This. No, it's not a red flag that nonconsent is necessary--that's the *point.* It's not significantly different than a rape fetish in that it's super common, non-consensual, and shouldn't be acted upon in real life unless you're willing to get consent first."

"OP -- you're living somewhere rent free, with no utilities. If you were living with roommates, you'd be expected to do some chores each day, in addition to paying living expenses. 

&gt; I try to do a load of laundry, or sweep the floors, or wash the dishes before I have to go. But some days I want to do other things with my three free hours.

Okay, OP -- a load of laundry does not take 3 hours. You put them in the washer, and you've got 30 - 45 minutes of waiting before they go in the dryer for 45 - 60 minutes, then you fold. Why can't you walk your dog while the clothes are in the dryer? Sweeping also does not take 3 hours, unless you live in a mansion. You should have plenty of time to read on the porch or do whatever each day. 

Adults have to make sacrifices with there free time. There are plenty of days when I'd rather be sitting on the couch listening to records, or go for a bike ride, but I have to go to the grocery store, or clean the litter box, or a million other little tasks that are my responsibility.

Bottom line, if you think your parents are asking a lot of you, they really aren't. And if that's not a good enough answer, and you're really done with the way they're treating you, then the only thing you can do is move out."

"WELP.

As I suspected, the flowers are merely the tip of the iceberg. 

This man is abusive. You hold yourself accountable for him name calling and getting PHYSICAL with you.  You say it's hard when you love someone so deeply, but I know and you know that you would ever cross that line with the man you love, because you actually love him. A true soulmate doesn't treat you like this. They damn sure won't put their hands in you for a start. 

&gt;I never believed in marriage or children before he came along.

Are you implying that you're willing to bring BABIES into an abusive household?  With a father that verbally and physically attacks their mother? You know women's emotions get out of wack during pregnancy and you'll definitely have more arguments. Could you make excuses for him hitting you while you are pregnant?  Or hitting your kids for whatever he's mad at them for?

Seriously, the flowers aren't the real problem.  This is.

"This is why NO ONE should be ""dating"" at 13, and why a relationship from childhood will rarely last. 
He's experimenting because he's been with one person his entire youth. If he was a good person, he'd have broken it off to sow his wild oats long before he sunk to frenching your housemate. He gaslit you when you started asking him why he was fawning all over her and not you. 

It hasn't broken him, he's totally been fine with lying and cheating in you while you were unwell. He didn't come clean and confess, someone else tattled to you. 
Sounds like a keeper! You are sticking around because it's been so long. Google ""sunk cost fallacy."" 

Don't stay with a cheater. He ruined your eight years, not you. The only thing you will be by staying with him is a fool. And screw your cheating and lying housemates. Find a sublet and move on."
"i'm pretty sure OP doesn't want to live with a roommate who hates her guts for a year, regardless of her rightness. that may be the only option that she has, but it'd be best to exhaust all other options first (namely, having a calm conversation with the roommate about the cat) before burning the bridge with someone that she's going to have to share an apartment with."
"Yes, it's selfish. Basically what you're saying is ""I should come first, and my wife's mother, who gave birth to her, should always assume that I come first."" If you genuinely don't see that as selfish, you need some therapy."
"I think it's relevant. In another post he says she had a crush on this guy while they were together, and wouldn't be surprised if she had wanted all of this to happen. Besides that, it kind of seems like she dumped him because she wanted to have sex with someone else, and is coming back because it either didn't work out or wasn't as great as she imagined.

Edit: Just want to add that I don't know for sure, just that it seems likely this could have been the case."
She wanted to see if the grass was greener...it wasn't and now you're option 2. Think about that.
"Don't pack or move a single thing of his. If he won't help with his shit then it can stay. Also, I would tell him you want to take a month to reevaluate your relationship. You'll either miss each other like crazy and be ready to start again  or you'll realize you're much happier without him."

"My dad did a similar thing, except it was before instagram and he just looked at barely-legal porn all the time. He eventually got caught by me, which totally traumatized me and ruined our relationship forever, and my mom was so upset, and my dad ended up going to therapy for porn addiction.

So just my perspective is, OP might want to point out to her husband how incredibly damaging it's going to be to their daughters when they are teenagers and realize that their dad is ogling girls their age.

Or as someone else pointed out, how they'll feel when their dad is obsessed with hanging out w/ their 16-year old friends and follows them all on instagram and likes their bikini pics too. *puke*"
"If he's straight, any cuddling is probably a no go. To be honest, it sounds like you are pushing boundaries that you would have as friends which, if he doesn't reciprocate, would put you both in an awkward spot and maybe even lead to you guys not hanging out at all."
"I gotta say, it's weird he went to HR.  Especially given your perception that you would be laughed off if you did the same.  I wonder how his conversation with them went.  I suppose it's a good sign though that he removed himself from the situation.  Hopefully that's an indication that he understands that this is not your fault.

I'd keep being as professional as you can.  Do your work, show your worth to the company.

You keep saying ""But it wasn't his fault, he was drunk!!""  Well, maybe he needs to drink less."
"&gt; That said, keep your mouth shut. They have a kid, he deserves both parents in his life.

The reason you'll get downvoted into oblivion is because it's horrible advice. Every single person I know who grew up in a broken home has said it would be far better to have parents who separated than ones who remained together yet couldn't stand each other. If this guy is at the point of giving so few shits for his marriage that he's sleeping with his wife's friends, eventually she will find out and it'll be 100x worse than if it's nipped in the bud right now.

Also, having kids does not mean you need to accept the unacceptable. You shouldn't have to stay with a cheating spouse for your kid, your happiness matters too. This woman has a terrible husband and a terrible friend, she'd be better off raising her kid on her own, far away from such negative influences."
It's she taking care if you while you recover from all these injuries? Because I'd leave you to fend for yourself if you weren't going to honor your word. 
"  Does he share information about the your finances? If he is keeping you in the dark I think it's a problem. If you know what is going on financially and just want access to the accounts its still a problem you two need to work through but not nearly as controlling as if he doesn't.

You say.

&gt; I do 99% of the shopping for our home (groceries, sponges, soap, etc.) and aside from my home duties (cleaning, having his food ready, etc.) I help out at the local homeless shelter and socialize with my friends (some who are married like me).

 Do you not have enough money to do these things?

&gt;  A friend of mine joked that I should tell him that if he doesn't want to share finances, I won't share my body with him which I thought was funny but might have some merit. He has a very healthy libido but I don't think that it should have to come to something so ridiculous as that

 Tit for tat things like this are counterproductive. Try and focus on what the issue is. If talking to him about it gets you nowhere, then see if he would see a marital counselor with you.

You're going to prevent this girl from moving up in her life because you're jealous? That is some asinine shit. This says a lot about your opinion of her. Why don't you just chain her up in your basement? She can't cheat on you if she doesn't go outside.

Ahhh, you fed her insecurity.  Definitely should NOT have showed her those instagrams.  Her intense curiosity is actually a fairly red flag that she is insecure and jealous.  

Tell her that you aren't into Asians, that you slept with Asian girls because those particular girls were showing interest in you, not because they were Asian, and that you don't feel you need to discuss this topic with her anymore.  If she can't accept that you chose her, she needs to be single until she can sort out her own issues."

Why date people you aren't attracted to? Makes no sense, unless you were simply using them.

&gt; it seemed that all the women that I was really into were into popular Frat guys.

A little introspection is needed here. Why were you only attracted to women who like the frat type, especially if you weren't the frat type? 

&gt;  I got a good job, and all so then getting the women I was into got a lot easier. 

I can guarantee you that having the good job isn't the delimiter that has gotten you dates. It's your confidence, the energy you put out, that attracts the people you'd like to date. Confidence often comes with age and experience. 

As for this girl friend, she sounds a little obsessed with your past, and so this might be your deal breaker. It's only a 4 month investment, and that's the time you're supposed to use to get to know someone. So, you found out she's racist. No biggie, find someone else to date. "

"it's ok for you to want to keep the dog. you have bonded and you feel invested in  making this work.

it is ok for your husband to not want to keep the dog. he hasn't bonded and is not wanting to put in the effort to train this dog. She does sound like a lot of work on his end to get her over the skittishness.

it is not ok for the dog to get put in the middle here and be yelled at regularly. It's a cycle - you and your husband disagree about the dog being there, the dog picks up on the tension in the home and pees inside, your husband is stressed by this and yells at the dog, you get upset by his lack of patience with the dog, and so on. 

dogs are a huge commitment and I don't  think it is ok to put the dog in a home where they'll be resented by one of the owners. you've already admitted your husband lacks patience and yells at the dog. for the dog's happiness you should let the dog go be adopted by someone else.

It's like organ donors - one of the criteria for being a match is *wanting* to do it. Even if on paper you can do it, are biologically a match, physically healthy enough to go through the operation, etc. you must want to do it with no external pressure. I'd argue the same for being a good pet owner. Your home isn't a good fit for Jessie if both of you don't actively want her there."

"tricky subject tbh. normally i would say that you should pay half of what ever the rent would be for that place if you had a landlord, but the fact that she stayed with you without fully contributing to the mortgage complicates things. The house you had mortgage on and she gave you 450 each month for it, how much would it rent for? more than 900? "
how about being a horrible judgmental wife and mother who abandons her family because her daughter dares to make a choice she doesn't agree with and has a father who supports her?  you think that will make you look better?
"For now you don't panic, you do your job, up your therapy sessions to work through this, and hope that you don't have to work with him.

If you do find yourself in a position where you must work with him, you make detailed notes about any abusive or harassing behaviour from him - once he's hired by the company if he does anything that breaks the company guidelines then HR can't turn a blind eye to it, especially if it moves into the realm of criminal behaviour. 

Consider looking for another job just to be safe - if the company is going to put his job before yours based on friendship with upper management, having a way out is going to be invaluable to you.

Is it right or fair? No. But you need to put you, your safety, and your mental health first - even if it means taking a step back in your career."
"being jealous and not putting in an effort in the relationship are two different things.

"Okay so. Since you specifically said you don't want to separate and want solutions other than that, I will go with:

You guys got together before he was even 21 years old. He never figured out how to get laid past basic biology and teenage hormones. He never got the memo ""Do nice things for your wife, pitch in, do your fair share, be nice, give random snuggles and cuddles at times other than when you want sex, and she'll be far more open to the concept when you do""

I also suspect he grew up in a household where either Mom did all the household work, or Mom + kids, but not the father. Which is where he gets the idea he's not required to pitch in, or make the kids do it.

It's really hard to get into the mood for sex when you resent your partner. 

Since you don't want to separate, I suggest marriage counseling, asap. Just a 3rd party person to kind of negotiate common ground between you two. A mediator, of sorts. Good luck!"
"I agree with this post. It sounds like he did care and is trying to hide it. OP should ask him why he is having a tough time with the decision to keep her last name. I went through this same thing with my wife so I might be able to provide some insight. 

At first, I wanted my wife to change her name because it symbolized a commitment to me. I was being insecure and thinking that she did not want to get tied down with my name in case things didn't work out. We had a conversation about her name and she wanted to keep it to honor her dad who raised her as a single father. Her last name was her identity. I asked myself if I wanted to change my name to match hers, and came to the same conclusion that it is part of my identity. We agreed that our names would be stay as they are and that it wouldn't take away from our goal of being a family. In the end, I don't care that she kept her name. She is still the same woman I married. Although now she is using my last name informally for convenience at places like daycare and the vet. 

One thing to discuss would be if you plan on having kids, which last name would they take, and logistical issues when one parent has a different last name than the kid. It hasn't been an issue for me, but I imagine some overzealous person not letting my wife pick up her child because her last name doesn't match his. 

Hopefully this helped "

"I can appreciate that. It's not always easy. Can you try saying something to that effect before you move from the living room to the bedroom or something? Can you sit him down and just have a conversation with him outside of a sexual context?

Until you can become assertive enough to protect your own needs, it might be damaging to you to continue having sexual relationships. It might be worth getting some short term therapy where they can teach you to practice being a little more confident. It comes with practice. Baby steps: start pushing yourself to assert yourself on smaller things, and work your way up. Stand in the mirror and practice assertive phrases. Then move to practicing saying them with a close friend. In the end, communicating your needs is essential to any sort of partnership, whether that's sexual, platonic, or professional."
"I don't understand what he expected you to do. He should have gone to the bathroom and cleaned up as much as possible, he could have bought a new shirt at one of the stores, he could have asked for help with bags (there are always folks around who will load up your bags on a cart for a tip). None of these would have taken the hour plus he would have need to wait for you to get to him. That's all to say if I were in either his OR your position, I would not have expected you to drive to the airport.

More importantly, if you are a parent, you need to have problem solving skills that involve being able to deal with vomit. He seems way too dependent on you.

"You aren't trapped you leave. This is all emotional manipulation at its finest to do what you just said: to ""feel so trapped"". 

Think about it, you can't actually help him. Are you a medical professional, are you a therapist? No, you haven't trained for this situation at all. So you can't help him. If he actually is serious about killing himself, you staying isn't going to suddenly fix the issue it's just going to prolong and enable it. And if he's faking to keep you trapped, then you have nothing to worry about. 

Those two reasons are why I always advise that you call the cops and report this and then tell closest friends and parents whenever he threatens to kill himself. Because that's the only way he gets help if he actually needed it. And if he's faking? Well you taught him a lesson. And even if you want to help him?

"I used to write fiction (nothing professional, or finished or anything.) My mother would always think any mother character was me complaining about her. It wasn't. It was fiction.

What I used to do was take a kernel of my reality and embellish and polish it into something dramatic and interesting. That could be what she's doing.

You should ask her if she really feels that way though. If she feels like you don't support her and she's lonelier with you than alone, she'll hate being married to you and it's better to face that head on. (I don't think she'll say she really feels that way though.)"

And the fact that you don't want *any* friendship with her if it's not a dating one probably means that a dating relationship would ultimately be unsustainable because you only want to see her as a *girlfriend*, and not as a complete person in her own right."

He asked a week in advance of the party if he could have one and we said yes. I feel like I can't cancel it without being 100% proof. If I canceled it because I thought he was lying, it could damage our relationship. "
"&gt; Your girlfriend is the one carrying and birthing this child. In the eyes of most people (and sometimes the law) this gives her more of a ‚Äúright‚Äù to decide what to do with the baby. 

I have been doing that. I have been supporting every decision she has made. I just can't knowingly place my child in this kind of situation. 

&gt; Adoption isn‚Äôt this perfect magical option. You two messed up and got pregnant. Now you‚Äôre asking other people to raise a child that you either can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt want to take care of. And honestly beggars can‚Äôt be choosers. 

Aren't the adoptive couples the beggers here? We do get to choose. 

&gt; How much more time do you have to decide? I would voice your concerns to your girlfriend and continue to explore other families. You could also meet with the potential parents and dig deeper into their views on race. But at the end of the day, if you‚Äôre confident that this family will love your child and raise him as their own.. that‚Äôs pretty good. 

Until 30 days after his birth. We can change our minds at any point. I am confident that I could love this baby and raise him as my own. That isn't good enough."
"It's her dad, though. They've been dating for two years. Family is the most important thing in life for many people. If he actually cared about her or her family, he'd go without hesitation."
"This is no way your fault, i mean other than couldn't you tell she isn't 20?

She is manipulative and a good actress. How could you have known all this?

You loved her and treated her well and you can go to sleep at night knowing you didn't screw her over.

I know it will be hard but you have to move on and time will heal everything.

And please don't let it cause you to have trust issues. Be cautious next time bu dont let her screw future relationships for you.

Hang in ther xx"
"
Maybe sit her down, and tell her, her behavior is unacceptable. And if she doesnt listen  to you and acts awful still just cut her out. 
Dont invite her to anything  go to a different room if both of you are in the same place. Dont talk to her. Just be polite.
Cause you dont need to take shite from anyone much less your sister.
Because the whole family thing is bs.
If you wouldnt let a stranger talk to you like that. Your sister shouldnt either
She doesnt get a free pass to put you down.
You need to cut that shit out. Either she behaves like an adult and stops being so mean and rude and hurtful. Or she doesnt get to be with you. Or ignore her if she is in the same place."
The difference between your story and hers is that you were honest with your SO from the start. She's been with him for a year now and he has never talked about this with her.  I don't think it's right to lead her on like that.
"A lot of people would consider posting on gone wild to be cheating. It's putting pictures of your body other there for sexual attention.

If you are sure it is her, I'd bring it up saying that you found some pictures that seem to be her on gone wild. Once she confirms it is her, you two need to have a discussion about sexual boundaries. Use ""I feel"" statements and try to state your feelings clearly, but make sure you listen to her, too. "
"""Sis is doing okay, Dad.""

""But-""

""Dad, I've explained I'm not comfortable talking about Sister with you anymore.""

""But-""

""I don't want to be put in the middle.""

""You won't be-""

""I'm not talking about this anymore. How have you been?""

The first several times won't go that smoothly, he will probably get upset with you. But you absolutely have to stick to the above in a general sense. You don't even have to tell him she's doing okay. Your sister is not a subject the two of you talk about. You aren't lying to him. You're choosing to stay out of an estranged relationship. As I said, he could know all about her life if he chose. Your sister already tried to reach out to him, and he rebuffed her. Now he has to live with the consequences, and those include no longer being privy to her life, and therefore his grandchild's life.

*He* put you in this situation. Do you realize that? Your sister is absolved from this by the sheer fact that she already tried to patch things up with him. The ball is in his court. All of this could have ended if he had made a different decision. You have no culpability in this. Set some boundaries. Live your own life. Don't allow your father to guilt you for ""lying"" to him. He made his own bed. He has to lie in it now. Don't let him drag you down with him. Boundaries are the only way you're going to keep both your sister and your father in your life. Don't let him force you into a family rift."

"&gt; You shouldn't make promises you don't intend to keep. With a partner or otherwise.

"&gt; he said he couldn't explain 

I'd give this marriage a year. He's an ass. "
"Agreed with these other comments, Op why stay with someone who repeatedly cheats on you? It doesn't matter whether she's drunk or it's an ex or it was just random. Bottom line is that she isn't loyal to you. Don't let her take advantage of you. Get out of this and let her find someone else to support her sorry ass. "
"Trust your gut.

Yes. Blindside hits are just a part of football. They suck. But everyone takes that shot in the heat of the moment. If the dude is big enough...then yeah it's totally possible 
"On one hand, I get where you're coming from. He could have discussed it with you privately.

But you told him you didn't want to speak to him anymore?

And if he had come to you private, there's nothing stopping you from saying, ""I'm over it, why are you even bringing this up, it's unprofessional"".

Don't get the guy fired, I'd be testing my direct report and their conflict management skills here if they were the type to get someone fired over personal stuff, I wouldn't respect them anymore because that is also unprofessional. 

I would just tell your manager that it was a long time ago, you're surprised by his statements and you have no issue with him.

"
"Very much this. Also my cousin had severe allergies and 3 years of shots didn't cure her and actually made her even MORE sensitive. This is not a cure for everyone and this is way too much for either of you. Everyone is saying this relationship is a lot of work and honestly it is. Break up, you haven't been together long enough for a beak up to be life altering."
"I think people are latching on to that because of this  
  
&gt;I'm sure she would try and make the move to Nashville if i expressed a strong desire to move there. I don't even know if I'd want her to come though.  
  
There is more to it than ""Nashville is a cool city"".  You want to live there AND be single and have everyday be like the bachelor party.
"
Ahhhh this is so cringe.  This is the stuff of nightmares.
"I am like your bf. I pick at my lips when stressed out. It gets bloody and heals poorly so I end up with hard chapped lips. Right now my top lip is chaffed and extremely dry. It's not attractive or nice to kiss for either of us.

He's mentioned it gently a few times and yes, I felt attacked, but I new it was a problem and felt embarrassed by my chapped bloody lips. I have redoubled my efforts to stop picking each time he's mentioned it.

There is something he can do about it but it's hard to change. That something he can do it simply trying not to pick and finding a new way to cope with stress. What can he do?! Anything! Anything is better than doing nothing. He has to try and he has to be held accountable. He needs an accountabilibuddy and the best people are the ones who are close to him. Him, his family, and you need to hold him accountable for this nasty bad habit. 

r/CompulsiveSkinPicking is a great sub and offers a lot of resources. The skin is extremely important and the largest organ. It's the first thing people see. A face full of red sores looks really bad for a professional trying to enter the workforce after graduation. 

Best of luck. It's a sucky habit to have to deal with."
"Other comments have already covered the gist; I would recommend getting mail forwarding set up to somewhere else so they can't interfere with your mail anymore.

Also, as far as I can tell, there is no reason you should have ever returned that car to them; you paid for it. Their cosigning was just a promise to be financially responsible in case you did not pay it off (unless your description was incomplete, *e.g.*, they are co-owners on it). That said, that car might very well be your property. I would consult an attorney on it if the car is worth any worthwhile amount."
"There is nothing worse than a non-apology apology. It just makes you look really bitchy. Especially since you asked for people's opinions and advice. The commenter wasn't even rude about the way they phrased their reply to your request!

"if youre an adult and you want your boyfriend to live with you without compensating the other housemates for reducing their living space, you can move out and get your own place with your boyfriend. you know, like most adults do."
"Ehhh, I am very possibly completely wrong here, but I think you're being overly-sensitive. I wouldn't expect to be included on a trip with my father-in-law, husband and his brothers. Sometimes families just like to do girl trips and guy trips. As for not being consulted first, well, your wife is a big girl and if she wants to stay home with you, it's up to her to tell her mom. Even if she wants to stay, you're going to look like a big party pooper if you're the one to say so. "
"No, they should not leave immediately, but I think that he should have opened up a discussion with his girlfriend. Sit her down and say this is what I'm thinking, this is what I'm feeling. She could have gained insight on what was happening. If they couldn't fix it, they both could have come to this conclusion sooner. I always believe communication is better than trying to keep it quiet. Maybe keep it quiet for a few months, but 2 years is cruel.

I agree with you in that it can take a while to figure out what you are feeling, but after a couple of weeks or a few months, the partners deserves to know, because it's about the relationship. It's about both of them, it affects both of them. It's not all about him. 

Instead of simply communicating with her, now that poor girl thought that everything was great, she was going to get engaged, get married, have a family. Her boyfriend who she thought loved her for all this time is suddenly, out of the blue, breaking up with her. Her world went from zero to sixty in a matter of moments. He could have avoided this by simply giving her an indication a year or two ago that this was not the plan anymore. "
"It's not shallow. Everyone has their thing.

"Your suggestion represents a lack of compromise. This is a choice of name, not a choice to go into treatment for an addiction to cocaine or something.  Names are very personal! Surely, out of all the solutions (them blending last names, her keeping the name and OP being ok with it, hyphenated names, OP changing his name) it won't come down to this choice of his way or the highway.

"You'll have to find another officiant, but if you don't mind paying somebody, that shouldn't be too hard. If you were counting on your father for anything else wedding related, figure out a different plan for those things as well. 

When you talk to your father, one thing to discuss with him is how his decision impacts any of his family members that were planning to attend the wedding. If he doesn't attend, are they still coming?  Is there going to be some sort of proxy war fought between his family and your mother at the wedding, or is he willing to talk to people about keeping everything pleasant?

The language about ""I'll free up time to visit you afterwards"" almost has me wondering if your wedding is an inconvenient trip for your father and he's using your mother as an excuse to skip.  

If he's decided he's not coming, that is sad and deeply unfair to you. But if that is his decision, you should respect it.  No good comes from trying to drag him there.  But it is a hurtful and childish state of affairs between him and your mother, and you are reasonable to be angry about it.  "

"No, because their attitude won't change without you there - you will just not be told about the barbs and comments, and be completely unaware of how abusive it has gotten until the children start parroting their bigoted views at you.

Keeping the kids away from them is absolutely the right thing to do."
"I agree actually. Op says he goes on trips with his wife to Michigan as if that compares with going on an international trip to a place as awesome as Ireland. Either he takes her on this trip and outlines clear boundaries so everyone can enjoy themselves OR he takes her on a separate, equally cool international trip (not to Michigan lmao)"
"&gt; This is just part of being a teenage boy. 

Shoving people who have asked you to stop is just part of being a teenage boy! Disrespect for other people's consent to being touched is just part of being a teenage boy!

Because of the nature of restraining orders and the information included(like your home address) if you do not live on base please invest in security cameras (look into ones that save to a cloud database and can be accessed by a smartphone). 

If you are living in an apartment let your landlord/building manager know what is going on. "
"Military spouse here....14 years and two kids.

This is the hard part. While the baby is young and the husband is low-ranked, this is the hard part.  The problem is that you're angry at him for things largely outside of his control. You can be angry and frustrated, but when you turn it at him you make the problem worse, not better.

&gt;he doesn't do anything to change

What is it that you want him to change? Specifically. Not ""I want more time with you,"" get specific. ""I want you to spend one weekend day with me and the baby doing family things."" Maybe this means you get the grocery shopping and errands done while he's at work instead of saving it for the weekend.  ""I want you to get up with baby one day each weekend so I can sleep in."" These are concrete, actionable things.

Use your resources. Financially secure? Get that baby signed up for CDC hourly care and drop him off for 3 hours on a random Tuesday so you can get some space. 

Stop looking to your husband to solve this. You have to come up with solutions within the parameter of his job. It's reasonable to say ""this Saturday I want us to spend time as a family instead of you working on cars."" It's not ok to say ""sleep less so I can see you.""

"
They're inflicting a man who causes nothing but strife on to you and your husband. Do they care about upsetting you? Do you care about upsetting your husband?
"Okay, so... you feel left out because your friends have kids, and you're worried about waiting too long to have a kid. I can see where those things might give you the urge to have a child. But it doesn't sound like you've actually THOUGHT about the logistics of raising children.

You don't feel like you have enough money for a nice proposal. You and your girlfriend are in the midst of changing locations and careers, so your financial situation is not likely to improve quickly. Children are EXPENSIVE. Like, even if you're okay going without certain things for yourself, children need those things and you should not be planning to bring a child into the world who you can't support.

Your girlfriend wants to be an actress. To have ANY chance at ALL of success, because Hollywood is sexist as hell, she can't be running around to auditions with a pregnant belly. When she does have a child, who will care for it? Not your girlfriend, if she's acting successfully. Are you prepared for the 24/7 job that is parenting an infant? Or are you expecting to split that duty with someone who doesn't want kids right now anyway?

Issues of marriage aside, this is not the time for you to have children. Your life circumstances would make it unusually challenging, and your girlfriend doesn't want to. She is not obligated to ""meet you halfway"" on this, because it's not really meeting halfway--it's you getting what you want at the expense of everything she wants. If you wait for kids, you're still likely to have them eventually, but if you have kids now, she will almost certainly never have an acting career--she won't ever even be really sure if she could have had one.

If not having kids NOW is a dealbreaker, then break up. Otherwise, be patient."
"Okay.  Your girlfriend has a lot going on here and,  honestly,  I suggest you take the ring and start planning a big,  romantic,  tell the grandchildren engagement because this is not what you want your engagement associated with.  

1. Emotional whiplash

Your fiancee was the happiest girl in the world- then got devastating news. 

2. Grief

She lost a cousin.  She may be grieving her sister's miscarriage. Her brothers were badly injured

3. Guilt

4. Fear

Fear that she's losing her family

5. Hurt

She is not only being assaulted by her whole family, but they didn't tell her this huge news

6. Anger

She's being attacked unfairly. She wasn't told that her brothers were in a wreck or her cousin died. Her family is treating her like shit. What should have been the happiest day of her life got ruined because her family couldn't keep her in the loop and are now attacking her. 

This girl has pretty much every negative emotion waging war in her head. 

If I were talking to her:

I would suggest you stop taking the calls or texts from the unsupportive family. See a grief counselor- you just lost a family member and having your family pile onto you like that would be traumatic for everyone.

Try to let op comfort you and support you through this. You deserve to be supported through this. Neither of you could know. "

"&gt; It came up somehow, later in the week, that we were to visit with his sister the weekend of the 20th. I told him I was working and wouldn't be able to come along. I clarified that I thought we would be visiting the weekend before and he said no, that he had told her we'd be visiting the weekend of the 20th

You specifically told him 

&gt; I told him I was working and wouldn't be able to come along

At the end of this story, after hearing multiple times that he was going this weekend, you tried to make plans with him for this weekend, after he had already corrected you that he was going this weekend.

All in all, the plans were explained to you multiple times. I think I counted three or four? You say you're upset because he didn't *specifically say*""but now I am going alone because you work'. He told you multiple times he was going this weekend. The fact he'd be going alone after you said you had to work is abundantly clear, because one logically follows the other.

If I were your bf I'd be very frustrated with this."
"Your only other post is equally as ridiculous as this one, so I'm either going to assume you're a troll or terribly naive and ignorant about females in general, but I'll bite anyway.

Not all women are clones of each other. A lot of women out there like things that are typically considered masculine, such as extreme sports, becoming gym rats, working on cars, etcetc. It doesn't mean there is anything wrong with them, it doesn't mean they have a problem with their hormones/testosterone, it just means they have a different kind of interest. Someone being slightly different does not automatically mean they have health issues. Some men prefer softer, stereotypically ""feminine"" things and there is nothing wrong with their testosterone levels either. It's just a matter of personality.

If you don't like her personality or if her ""aggressiveness"" is actually code for abusive then you should leave. Aside from that, suck it up."
"He knows Im not being a gold digger as Im from a quite well off family and never really enjoyed tge lifestyle (the money is my parents not mine) it took him months to persuade me to feel comfortable with him paying and he tried very gard to make me feel like he wanted to.

The thing I was gonna buy was something id decided to do after lunch that he called off for the kfc, i think underwear or something stupid, it wasnt a big deal just a little bit of a let down"
"Re: your last paragraph - signs are never as clear as the person sending them out thinks they are.  It isn't good to rely on signs and hints when you really need to have a conversation.

"&gt; He said that he understands that I have insecurities about things. And I let him know that I may have my own personal insecurities, everyone does, but they have nothing to do with his lack of communication.

This is called gaslighting.  He did not communicate at all, blamed you, and tried to make you believe a counterfactual."
"My SO is like you. He would blow up on me if I interrupted him to say hi or ask a question while he was in the zone working on a project. This would lead to fights and a lot of hurt feelings. He also criticized me for not having worthy hobbies by his standards.

I also prefer to get work done in the middle of the night when it's quiet and all of the neighbors are sleeping. My SO would invariably break my concentration by coming in to announce he was going to bed, and I would snap at him leading to more fights.

We finally sat down at a time when neither one of us was distracted and had a very productive conversation. We laid out ground rules. Now if one of us doesn't want to be bothered, we tell the other person before getting immersed in the activity. I tell him if I have a lot of work to get done to just head to bed without coming into my office. He tells me to not come into his office if he's working on something. And if he really is jamming on a project with a deadline, I will take a weekend trip without him. 

I also explained to him that my work is so mentally exhausting that when I have down time, I just want to relax and zone out on tv or just hang out with him. Things are so much better now that we are openly communicating. I also started using earplugs and always tell him when I'm putting them in. This means do not bother me until I open my door. "

If she likes different music than her, bond not over the song she's singing to but enjoy how happy she looks when she nails the third verse.

Equating compatibility with consumer tastes is a relatively new idea (as is the conception of modern dating, but let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater). As succinctly put in 500 Days of Summer: ""Just because she likes the same bizarro crap as you do doesn't mean she's your soulmate."" And just because she doesn't like the same bizarro crap as you doesn't mean you aren't compatible.

"OP, when normal people get cheated on they usually get angry and dump the cheater. Especially less than a month in.

Instead, your boyfriend used what you did as a weapon to bully you into humiliating sexual situations you didn't want to be in. Not once, but three times.

That tells me he was looking for an excuse to bully you. By coincidence, you provided an excuse very early on, but make no mistake, a man who reacts like that would have found a reason eventually. Maybe you would've answered a call late, or not been in the mood for sex. Maybe you'd have gone out in a dress that was too sexy, or gotten hit on (how dare you). Whatever. One way or another, he'd have found a reason to make you the bad guy and use your guilt to bully you into sex you don't want.

A man who reacts to getting cheated on by turning it into an excuse to humiliate and degrade his partner is not a man you want to keep around.

Get out before he stops even bothering to argue with you about anal and starts taking it by force. "

1) Keep quiet and professional.  If you have moved past this, it's likely she has too.  Treat her like you would any other coworker.

Or, if the writer seemed very concerned:

2) Mention to manager ""From the photos you have up I noticed there is someone I used to know who also works here.

If the friend *actually* said ""Hey I don't have a problem with her but she might have a problem with me"" that's not the way to go about doing that.  The ideal way is to let the past be the past because this is a workplace and not a bestfriendsplace.   If they had both moved past the issue, no one need bring it up. "
"So you're going to stay with him? That's crazy. Not only is keeping an SO on an information diet absurd, he's going to know you aren't telling him everything and get pissy over that. He's like a toddler still latched onto his mother. It's incredibly immature and if you're going to stay with him, you must either be really desperate and not care about yourself or you have no other place to live."
"I discovered that thread yesterday. So appalling.

If you're a woman posting there, prepare to be called a ""cumdumpster"" or ""fat slut"" by a 30 year old virgin who  would faint if he smelled a woman' perfume as she strolled past him."

You‚Äôve called him irresponsible and a drug addict‚Ä¶you‚Äôre upset with him for not making enough money and for not getting his car inspected‚Ä¶you don't trust him to take care of your unborn child...you‚Äôve almost broken up too many times to count...

"Agreed. On the other hand, I do think that unless OP has something more solid than ""my girlfriend has talked about sugar babies in the past"", he shouldn't concern himself so much with why she has that kind of money."
"Did he ask you not to hang out with guys, have you ever discussed it before? If he had plans with friends, you expect him to cancel to make plans with you? He isn't picking them over you, you need to plan further ahead. It would be rude if him to cancel plans to spend time with you on a whim. Talk to him about your feelings but realize you will need to make compromises and don't take out your insecurity on him."
You played love songs and kissed male friends on the cheek?
"Not that I disagree but OP stated that She doesn't discuss her trips for the company and just books it and tells Him, but he has to make sure she is okay with it. So Both need to talk it out, but only he does. That's what I got anyway. "
"Yeah, you're probably right... like, I'm well aware I am not simple to deal with. I'll get random breakdowns, or feel super sketched out in the middle of something and have to leave. Never once did he complain until all at once. Maybe I just did something extra bad, or he finally boiled over? Finding someone else won't be an issue, I don't even talk to new people.

"&gt;He has actively tried to change the way he views women and has become a totally different guy. 

LOL! You bought that- hook, line, and sinker. He has not suddenly changed into a new man. That's why he's dating young women, because women closer to his age would not hear his bullshit and actually believe it. 
He's a very talented storyteller, and you are just young and naive enough to stick around. Please dump the lothario and date a man age appropriate who respects you, and women in general. 

Age appropriate is half the oldest's age plus seven. You don't make the cut. It's creepy! "

"Most cats basically live in the living room and roam the house. I'm confused? Yes they're her cats, but I don't think they should be confined to the bedroom.

The pooping and chewing are problems. Are their litter boxes cleaned? I've had lots of cats and only have had issues with poop when their litter boxes are disgusting. I've never dealt with cord chewing, although I've heard of it. Are you cords generally neat, like behind the TV stand, rather than all over the place? I think keeping them out of the way might help. You can also run them in any citrus scent, which cats find disgusting.

Also cats are definitely safest inside. They can be killed by wild animals, dogs, and often even by humans. I think keeping them inside and making sure their living conditions are cat friendly, would help.

Edit: I read your comments. So I originally thought 4 cats was a bit much, though not unheard of, but I see now she has 12 cats, 8 outside, no litter boxes. That is super unsafe for the cats and the surrounding wild life. She has to look into rehoming them! Preferably rehoming them or a no kill shelter. I know your pissed, but if possible not a kill shelter, they don't deserve to be killed because of your dingbat of a sister. Are they even fixed? They'll exponentially make more cats! This is a huge problem, you need to talk to your parents about this and get the cats Rehomed. Maybe compromise and she can keep her indoor cats if they're properly cared for, but she can't have literally 12 cats."
"This is in some ways much more harmful to you than infidelity - it makes your life actively worse.

Is she generally impulsive and unaware of consequences?"
"You tackle people on purpose in football.  Of course he hit John on purpose.  It is not a crime to feel good about performing well in your sport and it is actually very normal.  I agree though that she should talk to him about it, but to find out if he meant to hurt him or not.  I also agree that the jealousy part is concerning."
"This sub is so daft.

I LOVE cats but what the hell is OP supposed to do in this situation? She specifically signed a lease with a no pet policy to avoid this sort of situation, future roomie has had a cat in spite of the rules and here we are with a shitty situation for all.

Completely the future roomies fault.

OP I would send her the message and explain, don't talk about taking action or anything yet as it will likely turn things hostile. It's going to take a deep clean of the house also."

"That's one of the things. She genuinely doesn't see anything wrong with ranting on and on while I'm the middle of some pretty important stuff.

I don't resent her for keeping me here, the education here is really good, but srsly I need time away from her. I'm proud of her for already having a passion and knowing what she'll study and having things generally worked out, but it's so hard to interact with her daily."
"I get this, but some things are obvious. You've been together 9 years, you should know if your SO likes the bed made. The dog needs fed no matter what, if its feeding time and you are busy and your SO isn't, she should just feed him.

I've been with my SO 10 years, and my biggest annoyance in the relationship is that I often feel like his mom, telling him everything he should do because its things that need done everyday. Its very hard to feel like being intimate when you feel like his mom. Its an ongoing conversation with us and he is improving and I'm getting more understanding. But you can bet if I'm out late and he hasn't fed the dog by the time I get home I'm really irritated.

Eta: I don't think she's communicating well, even if she's upset."
"Weight is 80% food/20% exercise. If she's really opposed to moving (at this point) I'd try and concentrate on food.  Maybe talk to her about meal prep?  Making healthy meals (even in the crock pot) and freezing extras for other meals?  Using protein bars and healthy snacks for when you don't have time to make food (and they usually are very affordable).  Try see if she can identify what the reason behind her poor eating habits are (is it convenance ? Money? Etc and come up

"I don't really know what to tell you, but I can say with certainty that I don't see parenthood going well for you.  You're calling a baby ""the thing""; that doesn't bode well.  But I'm not blaming you.  We all have limits of what we can deal with.  I don't know that I could cope either.

I would start thinking about and accepting the possibility that you may have to walk away from your husband and child."
"I don't mean to shit on you, but from my perspective you have been going about these decisions in a totally ass backwards way and causing major unnecessary problems for both of you. I mean, if being a landscape architect is such an important dream for you, why didn't you figure out what qualifications you needed to do that and where you could get them before starting a degree program that won't help you accomplish your goal in an area where you can't attend a program that will? I guarantee there are places where you would have had access to good programs for both computer engineering and landscape architecture, and if you would have gotten your shit together and figured out where they were, you could have just moved to that area and both pursued your chosen degrees. 

I am not saying just give up on the dream, but IMO if someone needs to give more than 50% to reach a compromise, it should be you, because this situation is mostly your fault. "

"I find it highly unlikely that all these people keep just ""coincidentally"" kissing her without her permission.

It's time to stop letting this go and bring it up as a pattern and see what her plan is to stop it. Is she generally an open, ""flirty""-type person, the kind of person that someone might think is interested and go for the kiss with? Does she regularly black out? If she gets angry and cheats while blacked out, it sounds like she shouldn't drink anymore.

That being said, you don't mention how long you've been together in this post but it sounds like no more than a few months - I doubt someone dumping this much drama on you in the first few months will be a steady relationship. I wouldn't want to deal with a drama tornado that just *happens* to be centered around my SO claiming they're just a poor little victim, drama happens *to* them and they don't encourage it. If you don't want drama in your life, you don't have to have it. "
You tell this story and completely leave out your reaction to your anti-vaccine pals when they brought out cocaine. Did that surprise you? Was that the first time? This isn't about your beliefs.

You can try to patch things up, but the balls in their court.  "
"Canadians commemorate D-Day as well, but the timing doesn't line up here. Based on a bit of rudimentary Googling, I think OP means ""Discovery Day"" in the infidelity-apologist parlance. In other words, the day she (and his wife/other side pieces) discovered he was a cheating sack of shit.

In that context, ""we got engaged shortly after D-Day"" takes on an even more ominous meaning that when I thought we were talking about an actual war. Gross."
This has happened to me too. The fact that materials cost and time could be making us money is oblivious to them. Ask them to work for free though and they'd lose their shit.

"&gt;The average yearly donation by Australian is $700-800 a year

Keep in mind that averages are a really bad way to gauge what's reasonable for an ""average person"" (in the colloquial sense where average means typical).  Averages get extremely skewed by outliers.  Charitable donations by a small number of extremely wealthy people can disproportionately affect the average in a very large way.

The average donation in Australia last year was $760, but the median was $200.  The median is the point that half the people are above and half are below, and it's a much better estimate of an ""average person"" (in the colloquial sense) than something that's so skewed by the very high ends.  

The $200 per year median is $16.67/month.  (That's per adult, so one would assume a two-adult household at the median giving level would be $400/yr, or $33.33/mo.)  And that's median donation amount, so we're ignoring the fraction of the population that didn't donate anything.  Of the ones that did, 50% donated at or less than $16.67/mo per person.

Certainly that's nothing to sneeze at, but it does seem to suggest that at $30/mo plus other donations for just yourself you *are* somewhat more generous than the typical Australian.  At the very least, you're significantly above (probably more than double) the level that 50% of donors fall at or below, plus there's around 20% of the adult population that didn't donate at all last year, so bare minimum you're in the top 40% for Australians for charitable donations, and probably higher."
"&gt;you will never even come close to paying back the time, money and sacrifice your parents put into raising you.¬†


I strongly disagree with that premise. A child does not owe their parent a debt because they fulfilled the legal and moral requirements one is obliged to fulfil when choosing to have a child."

Then go back in for the abortion itself and you can say that you had a chemical miscarriage between the first appointment and the second. In fact, you can even ask your doctor to lie to her for you to back you up. Generally they're pretty good with that."
"If he felt that way?  The time to assert it was when she asked, which he did not do.

I'm not saying to dump someone over one disappointing birthday, but it is concerning that it would ever cross his mind to say you're a terrible person.  You describing him as a shit is also upsetting.

Relationships start with love, but they last with respect.  Try to think of a person you really look up to, a coach, mentor, grandparent, teacher, etc.  Someone that you respect so much that if they suggested you quit your job you'd seriously consider and give weight to that idea.  You know that they are wise and would never suggest something against your best interests.  You would never think of calling that person a shit, nor they call you a terrible person.

Do you respect him?  And do you feel he respects you?

If not, that's the area I'd work on.  The rest would fall in to place after that."

Maybe he is I don't know, but is it possible that he got the job and once he realized you were working there as well he wanted his boss to be aware of the situation in case you said something bad about him?

Maybe he is a douchebag, but maybe he was just trying to cover his bases and was not being malicious. Either way I hope things work out for you."

"&gt;People who *always* wanted to be doctors *are* in medical school!

I strongly disagree with you. 

For starters, medical schools are so incredibly competitive, there are straight A students with amazing work experience who don't get in. I know someone who got rejected for med school despite being one of the most proactive, motivated people I've ever met. So no, there are plenty of people who always wanted to be X or Y but didn't get into school and got put off, or had to go for their second choice.

Secondly, life is not simply a case of ""work hard enough = you will get what you want."" It would be lovely if it was, but it simply isn't the case. This is a fallacy a lot of rich people subscribe to, because it makes them feel better to think that poor people just ""aren't trying hard enough"". Privilege exists, nobody can deny that, but somehow that doesn't translate into understanding that those who aren't privileged have to overcome so many more barriers to get to the same place. It's not as simple as ""my family is poor"" or ""my dad was sick""... especially to get into med school. It's not having the means and connections to get that work experience in a hospital or clinic that will mean you get in with someone else who has grades just as good. It's having to babysit your siblings because your parents work long hours and can't afford a minder and you barely having time to focus on your studies.

And finally (there's lots more but I don't want to ramble), some people just aren't sure enough at 16. It's so young. You might be able to look back and say ""fuck, I *did* want to be a doctor, I should have gone for it"" with hindsight at 20 or 25 or 50, but at the time, when being asked to make huge decisions like what to study and what direction to take your life in... can you really blame anyone for not being certain at that time? For thinking they do want to be a doctor but aren't sure if they can handle the debt, take that risk, be good enough to pass those notoriously hard exams? Or for falling in with the wrong crowd and being led astray? Or for having something life-changing happen like a parent passing away and not being able to focus on grades and getting into med school?

It's just not as simple as ""always wanting to get into med school = getting into med school"". Everyone in med school always wanted to be in med school, it's that hard, but not everyone who wanted to be in med school gets there. To think otherwise is baffling. People don't always get what they want, I'm not sure how you can believe otherwise."

It's much more likely that he wasn't trying to mislead you, but that he was trying to live up to the heavy demand you made of him and then realized he couldn't be happy that way."
"You're severely allergic to cats and your husband brought two home anyway? Without consulting you? Causing you to undergo frequent medical issues and physical distress? Pardon me, because I don't know you, your husband or your relationship, but having severe allergies myself, this seems like pretty fucking disrespectful behavior on his part.

"China definitely is very affordable and really nice! I have a cousin who taught in Korea for a year before teaching in China, and he's stayed there for 8 years! The language is a hit harder, but the pay and lifestyle is pretty nice.

I'm going to go to Korea for my first few years, and it's very nice (I've visited twice for months at a time). Very, very lovely people and amazing night life. Japan is very clean, but EXTREMELY expensive. My cousin is able to save more than half his paycheck in Korea while eating out every night, but most foreigners in Japan need to live very frugually to afford it. 

If you have a bachelors degree (in anything) this is a great option. China, Japan, and Korea tend to favor white foreigners than other POC, but its possible to get in. (Don't expect to teach in Seoul if you want a public school, it's the most requested and they are very choosey on applicants).

I have all the sympathy in the world for people struggling with mental illness, but staying with somebody who's hurting you by the way they live doesn't help them. You need to get out of this relationship. "
"Yes. You could have said I've had enough, walked out, and left for good.

 I understand you care about him, and my guess is that you're probably financially tied to him in some way, but his behavior is not OK, it's abusive. And if you stay with him, you're just going to get more of the same. He's never going to change. He's never going to say oh, I owe her an apology for the way I treated her, that wasn't right. He will never see it that way. Never. You coming here and posting about it, after this is just one in a long string of incidents where he's behaved this way, shows that you are allowing this behavior to continue. So stop allowing it. Walk out the door.

I noticed that you have ignored every comment that suggest that you leave him. My advice to you is that you pay attention to those comments. You cannot fix this."
You cannot trust his mother either. His mother did not protect your husband or his siblings. She cannot be trusted to protect her grandchild. She stayed with him - she didn't even leave their abuser when he hurt her children - she picked her spouse instead of leaving the person who abused them. It's ok if they get upset. They deserve to feel immense guilt. Your child has not been born and you are already protecting him/her. You are good parents.

There's a definite pattern here where he thinks that things belong to him because he ""needs them"" but he's not willing to really put in the effort to get them for himself. And when he's not getting his way he punishes you in all these little petty and petulant ways.

That's not a good partner.

You should tell him to go pound sand down a rat hole."

"It's easier for observers to notice these things. It's ok that you're confused but you also have to remember that your health should be your biggest priority and unfortunately you're probably underweight at the moment. Take your health into your own hands, start by checking your BMI as a start.

Your ""boyfriend"" is an asshole for taking shit this far but the good news is that it's so much easier to end a relationship at 21 than when you're in your 30's. You'll bounce back so much faster and realise you have so much time to find someone who doesn't abuse you and truly supports you.

I don't think either of you are in the wrong. This 'friend' has thrown a massive nuke into the middle of your relationship and it can only last if you both navigate it well. Have a proper talk with her and listen to her feelings on the matter and maybe try to figure out a resolution from there. I think it's also important to figure out the motive of the friend. Was she videoing you on behalf of the gf? Was she purposely trying to sabotage the relationship? "

"While I understand why you minimized it, that's also now causing the issue. Part of this is also your denial. You traded sex for money. That's prostitution. I guess you don't see it as such because you only did this with one person but I'm sorry, that still is. 

It's possible your fiance thought that there never was sex because of your phrasing, though that would seem strange to me. It's also possible that there could be an age thing here, as SD is much older? 

It's possible he just chose not to think about it and put it in the past because it was the past, but when he showed up the past became the present. I'd put a lot of money on that part being true no matter what. 

When he paid the bill when he was leaving, that could be just rubbing salt in the wound in again making the past the present. 

What he needs most is probably time to process. To make the present the past again."

"He shouldn't have yelled at you but... 

At some point, it's got to get tiring for your partner to be constantly forced to comfort you when they're ALSO feeling hurt.  Especially if it's true - that he listened to you all day - and you flipped out and failed to return the favor when it was his turn to have feelings about the relationship.  

You need to work on yourself and get your condition under control if you can't even reciprocate for him in the communication department.  It ISN'T all about you, and having anxiety attacks and constantly requiring comfort when he's probably the one feeling like he needs comfort IS basically making it all about you.  I understand that you can't help the fact that you have this issue, but if you can't hold up your end of the social contract of a relationship then you should probably consider being alone for a while until you get it worked out.  

Maybe I'm jumping to conclusions here, but I highly doubt that this is just the first time this has happened and he's biting your head off about it.  It seems more likely to me that this is a common thing for him to feel like he can't even tell you anything.  

Like I said, he definitely shouldn't yell at you, but you can't use your anxiety as an excuse to hijack the whole relationship, either.  "
"It's ok to not be attracted to him. You were attracted to the version of him that he *told* you existed... but that version was a lie.

This is one of the reasons I really advocate for meeting people you date in-person ASAP. If you had uncovered his lie within the first few weeks, you'd have a much easier time deciding not to continue dating him. Now that you've been together a year and developed a year's worth of attachment to him, that's way harder. 

Do you *really* want to continue dating him? Unless you never plan to live in the same place or visit each other, physical attraction is a major issue. Honesty and trust as well!"

"Nope, nope nope. That's a line that should *never* be crossed. Not even once. Once is one time too many.

No amount of provocation on your part justifies him slapping you.

"&gt; In his own words, he's essentially asexual when it comes to anyone he doesn't feel extremely close to emotionally.

There's a whole nother word for that. Sounds like he's demisexual. 

It's hard-wired into his brain that sex equals physical *and emotional* intimacy -- so hard-wired that he'd probably be physically unable to have sex with someone he's not emotionally close to. The emotion is such an inherent part of a sexual encounter for him that without that 'love', the sex just won't happen. It's just the way he is - as much as one can be gay or straight or asexual or a whole range of other orientations, one can also be demisexual. 

Being firmly in the demisexual camp myself, I can kind of understand where his confusion lies. The idea of casual intimacy is difficult for me to wrap my mind around when it comes to me personally; although I can understand that it's something other people engage in, I can't imagine myself ever taking part.

Now that being said, if you two are to stay together, he really needs to put the effort into understanding that there are different approaches to sex than his own, no matter how ingrained into him it may be. It can be tricky to understand, but if you stay together, he *has* to, because you deserve someone who isn't freaked out at your past. 

By way of explanation, I'm not exactly sure what you might say; it's like you either 'get it' or you don't. Maybe he'll have an 'a-ha' moment where it suddenly dawns on him, or maybe he won't. 

My husband, trying to put it to words, explained it thusly: 

""It's very similar to any other physicality you'd share with someone. You can hug someone in love or in friendship, or hug someone you barely know. Each time, what you feel -- what you share -- will be different. A touch on the shoulder -- from your beloved, from your friend, from a near-stranger -- all carry a different weight and inspire different feelings. And feeling one way about a stranger's touch means nothing about how you feel when your beloved does the same. Sex is the same way. With one person, you're baring your soul, inviting them wholly into you. With another, it's simply a moment of physical pleasure. These interactions exist independently of one another; one does not affect the other in any way.""

I hope any of that helps."
why did he string her along for four months if they weren't official? Doesn't make sense. A fuckbuddy would not wait four months. 
"&gt; Right now you have to be the sole support for your fiance, since her family has ousted her.

"This whole thing actually sounds like you are just playing us... There's no way somebody would not be able to see how much of a jerk you were throughout every situation you've described. You come across as extremely selfish and childish, and that's her problem. You must be kidding...

"I can't believe that for 5 years you've been having sex with someone who--as far as the evidence that's been presented to you-- doesn't brush his teeth or shower.

"I stopped reading when I got to the menstrual blood. Dude, her attitude or demeanor becomes pretty much irrelevant at that point. You just can't live like that. If it's as bad as you describe, she's got some‚Äãkind of mental illness. Staying with her is 'setting yourself on fire to keep someone else warm'. Isolate your finances, find a small apartment, and just up and go. You're not going to get your damage deposit back. After you're out, explain the situation to the landlord, write a letter to her family. But honestly, this goes from bad to worse. Get off the crazy train, claim your life back now."
"Haha. Thanks for the compliment(?) but chances are she's not jealous and truly believes what she's saying. She was very beautiful when she was young, never went to school or worked, and is essentially a trophy wife which is why my educational accomplishments mean nothing to her compared to the importance of being fertile and having lots o' babies!


Oh I actually left out a very important part! When this incident first happened my boyfriend actually suggested that we break up, but he quickly changed his mind. I guess that's what really disappointed me. The fact that despite him not agreeing with his mother he still cant help but be influenced by her. I also think he should have stood up for himself more! If my mother snooped around my apartment I'd be very upset at her. 


Now that I think about it, you're right. I shouldn't contact his mother."
"Not only that. Real life isn't the movies or TV. Most people understand being in love takes a lot of separate emotions and milestones to overcome. Namely being physically intimate with one another. Maybe even spending time living with one another or at least having dated a long time and going on vacation together to know what its like to spend 24 hours with someone else. 

Him just ""confessing"" he is in love with her means he's been building up a relationship that might not exist in her mind and might terrify her away even if she does have similar feelings. Its sorta like saying ""I want to buy this house"" before touring the inside of it and getting an inspection or ""I want to buy this car"" before taking it for a test drive.

"There is also no guarantee she's going to be the same person coming out of prison that she is going in. Or that you're going to be the same person.

"I'm very close to my mom, I know she hasn't down international travel, and I know she wouldn't travel by herself but I would never take her on a trip like this while excluding my SO. 

I would be very upset if my SO planned to take his mother on a trip like this but hasn't found time to take me on similar trips. You say your wife is clingy, but I don't think it's clingy to not want to be left at a hotel in another country so that you can spend one on one time with your mom. If you took this trip with your wife and your mom would you be willing to leave your mom at the hotel to spend time alone with your wife?  

When you marry you become a team. I would be upset if my SO spent a significant amount of money on a foreign trip that I wasn't allowed to go on.  It's the combination of the length of the trip, the fact that it's international, the expense, the fact that I'm not invited, and the fact that you don't go on similar trips with your SO. "

"&gt;if that person hadn't tried EVERYTHING they could to cope.

The keyword here is cope.

I took allergy meds every day when a roommate had a cat and still had trouble breathing, my asthma resurfaced, and I had a couple fairly severe reactions that prevented me from working.

I was on immunotherapy for half a year, two shots a week. Still couldn't be around cats at all without discomfort. Sure, it wasn't as severe, but it still sucked. Also, having two permanent mosquito bites on myself wasn't fun either.

I'll never be able to live with a cat. My allergy doctor warned me straight away when I said I was interested in immunotherapy that it would not allow me to live with a cat. He said it is useful for reducing symptoms in case of incidental exposure, not for routine exposure.

This is a dealbreaker. Expecting a partner to drag themselves through years and years of treatments just to be able to uncomfortably survive living with an animal is just unrealistic and selfish.

He's made it painfully clear multiple times that he will never live with a cat, and for good reason too. Ball is in her court."

He's saying disturbing things, and he's acting strangely. It would mean a lot to me if you reached out to him, and stayed in contact with him.""

Keep the focus on *his health*. As much as you can, stick to things he's said, or things you've observed, and avoid talking about feelings or thoughts or suspicions. 

Also, focus as much as you can on *solutions* rather than problems or blame. He'll talk about his reputation, or other things that can't be fixed. Refocus the conversation on his health, on visiting a doctor and getting a treatment plan.

Yeah maybe that's why. I won't though. 
"Simple.
Email her and BCC boss. That way he sees she doesnt respond, but she doesnt know youve copied boss.
"
"Then tell them straight out, social awkwardness only gets to be rude or inappropriate levels because people let it fester. 

And call them out on it: Every. Single. Time. They are adults if they can't take people telling them they are being rude that is their problem, not yours. 

I can understand feeling awkward about it since they are your in laws but get your husband to back you up. Hell he'll probably even start doing it himself if he's with them without you. (My boyfriend started doing it once I started calling some people his hangs out with out on their sexism and homophobia.) 

It's time they started realizing they aren't the only people who matter. 

Edit: Even if you don't think it'll go over well try it at least once. Just make sure both you and your husband are on the same page. 

You need to make it clear right off the bat that if this behaviour continues they can expect to not see you at social gatherings of this nature ever again. Talk with your husband, see if he is willing to commit to this as well. 

Even if they don't change or they take it horribly they don't get to live consequence free anymore. "
Tell the guy you've been dating what you've done.  You will find out real quick whether or not you cheated on him.
"Everyone else has answered the relationship question, and I see that you have made up your mind to end things with your gf (which I also believe is the right decision)... 

I just wanted to add in that you should ask your mom if she can get more of the photos? If she took them with film she may have the negatives, and if she has digital than she can just email them"
"Exactly. My boyfriend had an ""ex"" that became obsessed with me. And this, among various other terrifying things, is something she may have done. 

So I might be biased due to crazy people in my past. But that seems all sorts of weird to me. "
"Why on god's green earth do you think this might be your fault?  You are correct in your assessment.  He is being terrible.   More than I would put up with.  Going into rage and calling you a crazy bitch *once* is enough to end a relationship.   

Please save yourself from this horrible person and get out of the relationship."
"&gt;He did say that he had a girlfriend, but he mentioned me as a problem. So she asks to stay with him for a bit, hard times. He says there is two problems with that I am in a serious relationship and moving. Now, I'm pissed that he spent all night talking to her and giving her lead on's like I think of you, blah blah. He said he was being compassionate.

So, you are one ""problem"" and the relationship is another? Wat. 

&gt;Now, he makes it seem like I am a problem. Which I am today because I am hurt by how he talked to her and how he treated me for asking about it. He threw my illness in my face. 

Nope. No. No. 

&gt;Now, I sit here confused thinking I should leave because I don't like how nice he was to her. Or I am overreacting and overthinking? I want him to go but I want him to stay. I don't want to be hurt or alone, but I don't want to be disrespected like that. Advice?

Don't! Time to leave. Like now. 


"
"You need to leave fucking immediately! And I would highly advise getting a restraining order. You may not be able to get a full restraining order, but you can definitely get a temporary one then later show evidence of harm or direct threats to get a full restraining order.... I'm a grown ass man, and honestly, this guy even makes me really nervous... this is serious, I don't know if you're too young to understand these things, but this guy is going to hurt you very badly... you seriously need to get out of there, and make sure to get a restraining order.

EDIT: I see you're one year older than me... wtf would make you ever stay in this relationship?!?!!! GET OUT! "
"My ex kept begging me to give him ""the list"". I didn't want to, but he felt like my inability to produce a list of all the things he did wrong was proof od hom not having done anything wrong, ergo proof that I had been cheating on him and wad now dumping him for the next guy."
"Caps fan here.

Need I say more?"
Downvoted because it's terrible advice.   
"Why did you not read the entire post?  
&gt; I have brought up the issue of children together and what we would do with naming them and she has only responded with "" I don't know, but i want to be connected to them"". This makes me uncomfortable with the fact our children may have her exes last name."
"Maybe that is the reason. He tried to break her and didn't manage it. Maybe that's her way to tell him: ""You tried to own me and destroy me but I'm still my own person. You can't take that away from me."" And maybe the abuse she suffered is the reason she never wants to be ""owned"" by another man. (That's all just speculation though but maybe it's worth to talk to her about it.)"
We don't know whether his mother is being childish or not.  We don't know whether she said something to the father to make him back off of coming to the wedding.  He may feel like he cannot control her behavior and is worried she will make a scene at the wedding.  I'm not absolving him of responsibility.  I just am saying we don't know what his mother may be doing to contribute to the problem.  
"Even if OP accepts that it's her name, it is *still* also his name. It doesn't stop being his name just because it's also hers..."
"Find a new place to live. In the mean-time, give them the same consideration they show you. Do your laundry, make noises, etc when it's convenient for YOU."
"I feel the same way, and the close friends I have talked to about situations involving strippers, mansions, alcohol, drugs also feel the same way as I do. Hmm. That prude bug is contagious. "

If she has insurance through her parents or her school it would be no charge (except maybe a copay for the visit?) 
"Wait until he's on the holiday that you paid for, then sell as much of his stuff as you can and move out. Hopefully he has enough stuff to match what he took from you."
"You call her ""fucking lazy"" and (in your username) a cunt. Why are you with someone you don't respect?  Why is she staying with someone who feels this much contempt toward her?"
"Post this in /r/LegalAdviceUK maybe there is a way you could contact the bank? I'm not sure though.

Do you have a lease with him? Is he on the lease? Do you have a rental agreement? You can sue him for rent if you do. "
My husband's body temperature raises to 5000 degrees at night so he isn't allowed anywhere near me at bedtime. I cannot sleep if I'm even slightly warm.
"You can get a positive feeling from the attention, but it can also just be from feeling that you look really sexy. A lot of women wear sexy lingerie that no one actually sees, just because they feel good wearing it."
I highly doubt he doesn't mean it considering all of his friends said that he worshipped her with photos &amp; trips. OP commented that he doesn't do those things with her at all so why shouldn't it be believed? Just because you're drunk doesn't mean you're lying.
"I was going to say, if she brought it up just a few days ago, she may have just wanted to start opening up about it, trying to automatically insist on therapy and ""let me help you"" trying to *fix* it non stop would make anybody defensive. If I opened up about something private and got that kind of response I'd start ""geez it's not that big a deal forget I said it"" too because I'm sure she feels kind of attacked."
"Put your phone on vibration and under your pillow, tried and tested - you'll feel it and probably even hear a bit of it."
"He sounds like a shit father and ""custody issues"" does not put him in a good light. Men WILL get custody if they ask for it and are fit to be a parent (job, place to live, etc). So he's either lying to you making his ex out as some crazy bitch  (red flag #1) or he was an unfit parent back when his kids needed them the most. And even now, he forks his kids off on a woman who barely knows them, hasn't gotten a job to support them properly  (working nights as a single parent shouldn't be acceptable since he can't look after them properly) and just sounds like a bad father ""tuning"" his kids out after apparently not being in their lives for how long? You are smart to extrapolate his current behavior into the future. It's risky to continue to hope he will change as people don't usually change. And those kids will hopefully always be there in his life"
"I think the middle ground would work. An IOU with specific dates and amounts that he promises to stick to. A clearly outlined set of chores. Don't expect anything more from him than is written into the contract. Don't let him put paying off until he moves out, but maybe a month or two before he's due to pay up. "
"I would enlist my mom to tell his mom. 

&gt;The most shocking thing I find of this whole ordeal is what she had the audacity to say to my mum, roughly translated is something along the lines of, ""I'll act as your informant since I hear more about/from your daughter than you do"", which I consider being extremely rude and hurtful

Specially after that GEM. 

I am all about ALWAYS giving back. 
"
"Since he raped her, no it's not.  That sort of negates any kind of ""you disrespected me"" comments.  There is literally no conversation worth having besides that one.  She needs to get out."
"It is OP's decision to make whether she wants to maintain contact with her mother or not and I never said otherwise. But you cannot claim somebody who abandoned 3 small children and kidnapped the 4th one is in any objective sense ""a good mother"". Yes it sounds like she was a ""good"" mother to OP by providing for her and being kind and loving to her through her childhood, but she did all this while actively lying to her and depriving her of her family. I'm in no way ""applying my own feelings"", I am stating the facts of what OP's mom did. OP may, after thought and reflection come to the decision that she wants to maintain a relationship with her mom still and that's fine, but she is not going to process this situation and deal with it in a healthy manner by deluding herself about her mother and what she did. "
"It's pretty normal. Growing up, my brother always flipped out if his team lost. As long as she isn't taking it out on you, doesn't seem like a problem "
"And if you *do* want to talk to him, do it somewhere public. I know a lot of police offices will let you if you call ahead. But make sure there are people around so he can't try anything. "
"Uh some people cry when they're sad, and some people cry a lot when theyre sad. One of this girl's closest friends assaulted her and started spreading rumours, and you're wondering why she's upset? "
Stop answering him. Stop talking to him. Entirely. I know you haven't accepted this as permanent but it's time. 
"You guys seem to have some significant compatibility issues. I can understand why she might be attracted to a ""functional adult"", but I'm wondering why you're with someone who seems so incompatible with you?"
"Seriously, what do you expect him to do?  You even said it's military and he can't change it.  Start supporting him and being there for him rather than making arguments about things he has no control over.  Jeez, what happens if he gets deployed?  

&gt;I'm so mad at him

he's probably spending one of his weekend days with his friends because he finds it too stressful at home being nagged and fighting about things he cant' change.  Start supporting him and being loving and I'm sure he'd rather spend time with his family than away from home. "
"In fact, OP might gain some SYMPATHY for getting out of a controlling relationship."
"&gt; Today, I got a letter from a ‚Äúlawyer‚Äù on my desk threatening to sue for custody. This lawyer is fake, in my opinion. The lawyer couldn't spell right and is obliviously using way too much legal jargon that doesn't make sense in this context. 

In addition to everyone else telling you to get a police report for the incident at work as well as the harassing text messages, and file for a restraining order or protection from abuse, I would also see if you can look up the attorney's office and if it's a real firm, forward them a copy of the letter you received asking to confirm it came from them. They will be very interested to know that someone is fraudulently using their letterhead this way."
"I don't think they meant it as an insult to you at all. I am someone who also had a narcissistic mother, and it really warped my sense of what is a normal expectation or demonstration of love and respect in a relationship. 

It's really terrible that your husband dumped your flowers in the trash and called you a terrible person, all on your birthday. That is someone with anger issues. I have no idea if your husband is a narcissist or not, but when you expressed your disappointment because he made promises he didn't keep, his response was to DARVO (deny, attack, and reverse victim and offender) you, which is a really common tactic for abusers and narcissists. It certainly isn't a healthy way for him to treat you or to express his feelings. He denied he ever promised to wake you up for dinner, denied he had talked about all the awesome gift ideas he had for you, and then went on the attack, shifting the focus of the argument to how you were a ""terrible person"" for being disappointed with the flowers and when he trashed them, instead of taking responsibility for that act as his choice to express his anger, claimed he did it because that was where *you* thought the flowers belonged. It's a way for him to duck out of all responsibility for his failings and his choices in the way he expresses anger and pin the blame entirely on you. He doesn't want to face facts and feel like the ""bad guy"" so he goes through all these mental gymnastics to make *him* the poor wronged innocent party and *you* the bad guy. 

You have said that a lot of the behavior you describe in your OP is not new behavior for him--last year's birthday, you said, was a disaster. What happened last year? Is this reaction of his (DARVO) something he has done before? I just worry that because of your mom's issues, you may not realize that the relationship is not healthy. I know I had that problem when I started getting into adult relationships: my first serious relationship was with an abuser, and I couldn't see the red flags because my mom had been so bad that he seemed normal.
