I saw people openly weeping on my commute this morning
"I made eye contact with a man looking misty on the B this morning. It made me cry. Then he got up to exit at Atlantic Ave and put his hand on my shoulder and told me it would be okay.

It was a horrible commute and a horrible day, but I'm holding onto that interaction.

I wish I'd reacted with much more gratitude than I was able to muster in the moment.   

edit: I'm also nervous this sounds like some r/thathappened stuff. I promise you it did."
"My cat, being homeschooled, is far too advanced for toys. We have a sitter come over and read Hegel to her during the day. In the evening we go over differential equations"
"You have to look at protests for what they are: a loud message. It's not a demand he give up the White House, or any repudiation of the 48% of America that voted for him. 

It's a warning. Don't do the worst of what you've said you do. Or there will be more of this. Don't violate human rights, don't destroy the social progress we've made. Or you'll hear more from us. 

This is the essence of our democracy. This is why we have the freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. This is as old as America itself. Here, we allow voices to be heard and statements to be made. Today, a lot of armchair protesters are fine voicing their displeasure on Facebook. But from the Boston tea party to Woodstock to now, protest is always how the unheard voices of America have made their presence felt, known, and eventually respected. In the real world. On the streets. "
"Not sure if this fits the spirit of the original question, but I was walking down the street during the morning rush and noticed this guy in a suit, doing the ""I have to get to a meeting walk"" headed the other direction. He notices a bush with a bunch of flowers and says, ""whoa"", stops, smells them for a second, and then continues off to wherever he was headed. I thought, I just witnessed someone literally stopping to smell the roses. Or some kind of flower, anyway. It was nice. I always remember that moment."

"I actually had two moments like that today... There was a woman on the R train next to me this morning, ashen-faced, and while not outwardly Middle Eastern or Muslim in appearance, she was sending texts in Arabic. She had made eye contact with me a few times, so when I got off the train I really felt like I needed to do/say something. A squeeze on her shoulder and a knowing smile seemed like enough, and she returned the gesture.

Then, tonight, on the A train going uptown, there was a blonde woman, probably in her mid-40s, whose eyes were red and puffy from what had obviously been a very long day. I don't know if her woes were election-related or not, but whatever they were, I touched her hand and told her it will all be OK. She smiled at me and I walked off the train, nothing more to be said.

Just being *kind* raised my spirits, so I hope that if nothing else good comes of this, people learn to simply treat each other better."
"I saw 3-4 people crying on the phone during the short walk home from my girlfriend's place this morning.

I was a total zombie all day. It's the same drained, out-of-sorts feeling I have when I'm grieving."
"Regarding the ""vice versa,"" pretty much any event where the organizers don't cap the number of people allowed at the same time and vastly underestimate turnout.

Dumpling Festival in Chinatown? Sounds amazing, let's go! Turns out 50,000 other people thought the same thing and we waited in line for 3 hours for a single tray of six dumplings.

Queens Night Market? Lots of food, should be interesting. Nope - 10,000 people show up and again, lines for miles.

Some modern art festival thing on the high line? Literally so many people showed up it became a fire hazard and the cops had to be called to escort groups of people down.

Because of this, I now scrutinize any event unless there are tickets with a cap.

EDIT: following up with something positive - Times Square in a snow storm. I thought it would suck, but there was almost no one there and it was beautiful. Top of the Rock - full of tourists, but the view was amazing. Same with the World Trade Center observatory. "

"People are genuinely scared for the future now, and for their lives/physical safety. Leading up to the election, we saw a lot of people threatening insurrection if trump didn't win, and now people from at risk communities (women, people of color, lgbtq, disabled, immigrant families) are faced with the prospect of losing some of their hard fought rights, as Mike pence has promised, and also face the renormalization of violence against them (as confirmed by the increase of hate crimes over the last few days), as well as the dangers of at risk people losing desperately needed health coverage should the ACA be fully repealed. . If it really makes you feel better to say that they're babies for voicing their fears in a way protected by the Constitution, that's your constitutional right, but it doesn't change their deep, real fears. "
"I'm as legal as legal can be, and can produce papers within 30 seconds. I'm not even Mexican and live 2000 miles + from a border state. I'm still terrified of being caught on the wrong end of a panic because there are plenty of Americans I know who bemoan ""immigrants"" and ""illegals"" in a very scary way. "
"It wasn't just you. It was fucking awful, damn I still don't believe it. "
"I didn't personally cry, but I understand why some people are.  It's not about Hillary.  It's the fact that half the country fell for this two-bit pimp con man from Queens.


He doesn't deserve to be respected.   He doesn't deserve to have his picture in the history books next to honorable men.



I woke up this morning feeling like I don't know my own country.   "
"Called a ""pizzeria"" in MA and ordered a large pie. 
They told me to call whatever number for the bakery...."
"It's as if something that was 240 years old, and we thought would be around forever, had unexpectedly died."
Yesterday there was an excited buzz in the air. Today no one in my neighborhood could even look up. It's pretty awful. 
"If you can't make it back up on the platform, say there's no one around to lend a hand, then my understanding is that you should run toward where the front of the train would be when it is stopped in the station to give the train as long as possible to come to a stop in the station before it hits you. If you think about it, if you make it into the tunnel right in front of where the front of train was going to stop anyway, then you're clear.

I read that sometime after the shovings in 2012, right after I moved to town, and while I hope I never need to use the advice, and it may be total crap advice, it made me feel better to have an idea in my head of a scenario which was survivable."
"I'm not going to the protests. He is going to be the president, I've cried about that so much and I'll cry more, but he is, and people voted for him. Instead I'm going to organize: let's make sure there will be birth control available, let's protect Muslims and immigrants who are here, etc"
"When you start your order with ""Lemme get a..."" and without a please."
"All we talked about at work, when we weren't quietly stewing. Rain certainly didn't help. 

I'm currently drowning my worries in curry."
A friend who was black and Jewish had a Run-DMC/Woody Allen themed bat mitzvah. I'm pretty sure it was called Hannah and Her Sistas. 
"I saw a guy preparing to jump from the fourth floor of a building. When the police pulled him back in, I heard an audible groan of disappointment from the crowd that had gathered, and one guy even said ""he wouldn't have even died from the fourth floor""

A block away I saw a homeless man jacking off into an abandoned phone booth.

The few days prior had been really strange for me, and these two events strangely made me feel like everything was back to normal."
"I've posted this every time someone asks this questions, but it will forever be embedded in my memory.

In Union Square maybe 7 years ago a guy was walking around asking women if they'd let him lick their feet. He got a few women who said yes, one let him lie down in front of her so he could rub her feet all over his face.

"Why do you have to be a complete dick about it? People are really concerned for what this means for them, especially immigrant communities and people of muslim faith. NYC is a melting pot - people of all ethnicities and walks of life. You shouldn't shame them for being frightened - they have good reason to be.

&gt;You could have had bernie.

It doesn't work that way."
"A vote for Trump is 100% endorsing those things. So, yeah, will gladly villainize every single deplorable who voted for him. Thanks. "
"Dude the country got wrecked during the Bush years, and trump has the potential to be even worse. I really, legitimately do not think we'll be fine. 

We'll all survive, we'll get through it, but no I don't think we'll be fine. "
"Protests against our new Supreme Leader, I would imagine."
"Water with lemon? That's the best you've got? Lame 

I like that you can get gyro or souvlaki at any and every diner in the metro area. Once you leave NYC, they will just look at you funny. "
"Everyone I talked to is incredibly defeated, and rightfully so.  I'm honestly thinking of moving out of the country.  I'm embarrassed to be an American."
"Reposted comment from a similar thread, but:
&gt;It was six years ago, but I witnessed a fisherman reel up a bicycle from the sea out in Coney Island. [Picture proof.](http://i.imgur.com/rxTqPOz.jpg)"
"Sorry, but this upper-class white girl thinks it's pretty fucking terrifying. We have a man in office who thinks it's A-OK to not only pay women less and treat them poorly, but also sexually assault them? This fear is only amplified if you happen to have brown skin or come from another country. 

It's naïve to act like this isn't terrifying—not entirely because of Trump himself but because there are X million OTHER people in this country who believe that all of those things are OK."
NYPD? It would be a crime and all. 
don't move away. move to a swing state.
