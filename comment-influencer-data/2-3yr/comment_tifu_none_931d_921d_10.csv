How the fuck are you in college?
I genuinely don't see how this could happen.

"She invites you to the mall to hang out with friends.

Did this date happen when you were 14 in 1992?"
Oh I'll take her out with something... I mean uh somewhere.
"My bro did a very similar thing back in comprehensive school. Hyperventilated or something till he felt dizzy then held his breath while straining. He blacked out, smashed his head on a table. Ended up in hospital and had to undergo lots of epilepsy tests cos he was afraid to tell the teachers he was being  a dolt. "
Before yesterday neither did I.
This is the post the cops will refer to when they arrest you next time.
"This is the best way to hide you're a serial killer. Make a joke, get in trouble, get cleared, and let the murdering commence. 

Edit: Thanks to everyone for the upvotes. I posted this right before surgery while I was being drugged and had no idea that I said this. What a wonderful surprise. "
Nailed it!
You're actually going on a second date with her?! Please don't admit to the multiple banks you've robbed or the insider trading that you've been a part of.
"Well, good luck on the second date. I assume you're going to take her out to a dark alley."
She's pretty hot.
"Claim ignorance, prepare counter accusations. ""I thought this was linux...where am I?"""

She's insane. And an idiot. *She's* the one that brought up the super-awkward topic of serial killers. You either diffuse that with comedy or awkwardly laugh as conversation comes to a screeching halt. She has obviously never developed any social skills.
"Was I the only one who expected a sudden, involuntary erection in dad's face?"
"Same as regular prison.

Just with more tentacles.

Edit: Congrats boys my most upvoted comment is now about tentacle pr0n hope you're happy with yourselves. It also accounts for over half of my comment karma now."
"Why in the world would they give a fuck that a pair of baby pants disappeared. Walmart wouldn't care. McDonalds wouldn't care. The baby has a million others and it will grow out of them in a week anyway. Moms carry extra shit cuz they know some will go missing. Seriously, why?"
I wonder what Japanese prisons are like. 
"&gt; it doesn't help that I recently shaved my head.


Stop doing Neo-Nazi things. "
"Oh hell if I know, I'm so not going on a second date. Partially because she hasn't asked, partially because I'm not sure if she's insane or I am."
Indirect kiss! Indirect kiss!
"I'm going for the record. From now on, I will never stop holding my breath. I will update you all later. 

Update: H E L P "
"Ha! Ha! This is great!  Not only have you already infested her with germs, but you've already shared a piece of gum with her.  Time to ask her out bro. Not many barriers left to landing in the sack together. "
"My dad accidentally punched me in the face when I tried to wake him up one morning. (He grew up with 2 prankster younger brothers.) So from then on, I learned to always say ""Dad!"" really loud and shake his leg to wake him up instead of being up by his head. The family still jokes about it and gives him crap 25 years later, but I totally forgave him when it happened. "
"""Let me into the college or I'll kill myself by holding my breath!"""
Missed opportunity to hit on the girl by telling her she's breathtakingly beautiful.

"At least the site you referenced says ""Because the Life Rune also continues to be used by non-racists, typically adherents of neo-pagan religions, one should not simply assume that a particular use of this symbol is racist, but should carefully judge it in its context""

So as long as you're not looking like a skinhead and dont have the symbol accented by swastikas and whatnot, i think you'll be alright haha.

If it makes you feel better, ive seen this symbol before and never attributed it to neo-nazism!"

Same thing happened to me in high school. I would often hold my breath until I passed out because it was fun to show my friends. I did it a couple of times and ended up in the floor. One time my teacher thought I had a seziure and sent me to the nurse. I was too afraid to tell the truth so I ended up going to the doctor. My mom was on to me though and recommended I take a drug test. Wasn't on drugs though... at that moment. 
But getting arrested was on her bucket list!
TL:DR I was bored in class and attempted to kill myself

"Do yourself a favor: do NOT talk to JAG until you've talked to the area defense counsel. Do not say *anything* to *anybody* until you've discussed this with the ADC. Frankly, you probably shouldn't have posted this, and the ADC will be kinda pissed that you did, what with the details and all.

[Seriously](http://mimesislaw.com/fault-lines/when-i-said-shut-up-i-also-meant-online/12744)-- [it's way better not to talk to ANYBODY until you've talked to a lawyer.](https://www.popehat.com/2007/10/26/shutupshutupshutupshutup/).

This is doubly true in your case: the JAG is prosecutorial and represents the command structure trying to kick your ass out. The Area Defense Counsel is an advocate *for the serviceman*. You need to talk to the only source of legal guidance that actually has your interests at heart if you want any chance at keeping your fucking job!

God only knows if the JAG won't go fishing for enough to turn that NJP into a full-blown court martial...

Make an appointment with the ADC *FUCKING YESTERDAY*."
"Riiiight.

Hello 911? Hi yes I'm on a date with this guy from tinder, I've got conversations with him documented. It's the first time we've met and he's told me he's a serial killer despite that being a really really really rare thing and I think it's normal for them to admit as such on a first date so it must be true. Can you come and arrest him please? 

Police: we're on the way. Thanks for the tip! "
"i cant tell if youre still joking this time, im reporting you to the popo"
**TASTES VERY STRANGE**
"I girl I dated in highschool was really interested in serial killers. She read their biographies, police reports, followed the news releases on their trials and appeals, and everything. To say she had a fascination with them would be putting it mildly.

If you're interested, I can see if she's been widowed again."
"&gt; I passed out because it was fun to show my friends.

"
"Please, I have cockroaches at home that need crumbs!"
"Ummm dude that sucks. Have you talked to ~~JAG~~?  
  
Edit: as others have rightly pointed out, *defense council* is who to talk to!!! Yikes... here I am trying to get OP kicked out more quickly."
Wait but she's cool with it now?
Tobias? Is that you?
It's been 8 minutes... he's dead.
"Actually, it's not all that uncommon. The same thing happened to me a few years ago. Certain people can't take a joke I guess.

I was a little luckier than OP though, in that I was mentally prepared for when shit went down. Here's what I did: 

As soon as the first police officer showed up I knew what was happening. I smiled and said ""Thank god you're here officer, I was just with a girl who told me she was a serial killer. She went that way."" I pointed towards the bathroom. 

He nodded ""I see. We'll just have to take both of you in for questioning."" 

Now, here's the master stroke: when his partner showed up not far behind, I gestured at the first cop and said ""That police officer is a serial killer!"" Immediately the two police officers flew into a frenzy trying to arrest each other. In the confusion, I slipped away from both of them and took the bus home. 

Later that night I got a surprise call on my secure line. It was the date from earlier. 

""Clever,"" she said. ""I guess you're not like the other guys.""

Grinning, I replied, ""Does this mean I get a second date?""

She laughed. ""That's pretty forward for somebody who didn't even bother masking their reverse DNS on the dark web. I'm tracing this call as we speak.""

""You forgot about one thing,"" I said. 

""What's that?"" 

I chuckled. ""The name I used on my Tinder profile? It was fake. I'll pick you up at 8 on Tuesday."" I hung up. 

We've been going steady for about three years now. Saving up for a ring. "

Also they must have wasted so much money paying all the workers to search for an item which cost maybe $5 tops? Makes no sense 
"This isn't a TIFU by joking about being a serial killer. This is a TIFU by going on a date with a fucking moron who can't read obvious sarcasm and then took that to it's absolute extreme.

"Listen to me very carefully. I work in an environment where I see exactly this kind of problem with students gaining inappropriate access to student issued devices and getting admin access to their school network... I'm not going to say exactly what kind of position I am in, but I will say this...

DO NOT SAY YOU WERE TRYING TO HELP THE IT DEPARTMENT PATCH A LOOPHOLE! We laugh every time someone tries this on us and all it does is admit your guilt and that you knew what you were doing. In fact it makes it look like you are a threat and can not be trusted.

Depending on how your school/district handles these issues, your computer was not returned because they wanted to see exactly what you did to gain admin access. If the IT people responsible for looking into this are worth their salt, they will know exactly what you did and find that you did something anyone with sufficient knowledge would be able to do. In other words, it comes down to how you reset the admin password.

There are tools we use that are meant to help IT personnel recover passwords and are not considered ""loopholes"". I suspect you used one of these tools (that I may have used before myself) but what that means to you is that ultimately, you violated your Acceptable Use Agreement for a school issued laptop. No matter what you say, they have that against you.

You got caught, the best thing you can do is explain that your intentions were not malicious and that curiosity got the best of you. If you seem like you are sorry for what you did, you have a better chance at getting out of this without any serious repercussions.

The real problem here is that what will happen next depends on how technologically savvy the administration at your school / district is. If they know what you did was just exploit a common password reset tool, you may get a slap on the wrist and your computer privileges revoked. If they believe ""OMFG HE FUCKING HACKED US"", you could see anything from suspension to expulsion and/or having the police involved (which most police just roll their eyes at cases like this but they need to identify if there was any actual hacking involved). Believe me, they are running this by their legal department even if they don't mention anything that drastic.

Above all else, be honest about it. Do not try to act tough, do not try to sound like you know more than you do. Just answer the questions they ask you honestly and don't make it worse on yourself.

TL;DR: You did indeed fuck up. Own up to it and say you are very sorry. Good luck.

Edit:

Just because this is my top post in the thread I am getting most replies to, I am no longer going to reply back to everyone chiming in that a lawyer at this time is a good idea. I'm tired of rewording the same arguments over and over again. If you are the type of person to immediately consult a lawyer then I feel sorry for you. I know from experience that this is the wrong time to consult one. Nothing you all say to the contrary will convince me otherwise."

"That sucks, but just an FYI for the future.  If you Google emergency locksmiths, a lot of sketchy websites tend to be at the top.  They'll quote you like 30 bucks on the phone but when they get there, your lock will be ""very difficult"" and they'll need to either call their supervisor or just drill the lock and charge you 10x what they quoted.

A good locksmith will be able to get into most apartment locks, but it may take awhile depending on the lock.  Drilling is a last resort.  The sketchy ones don't care because it's easier than actually picking a difficilt lock and they can charge you more.

Look for a certified locksmith with a long history.  Most will quote you a decent price on the phone AND tell you they won't drill unless they absolutely have to and provide a price for that.  The sketchy ones are counting on people in situations like you.  Stressed and desperate to get somewhere so they can charge whatever since they never quoted you anything."
"I think the real problem here is whoever decided the best solution was to dig through a dumpster for baby pants until 2am. After it became obvious you'd have to dig through trash to find them, surely you'd just compensate the woman $20 (or even $50 just to shut her up) and move on. "
"There's a lot of unknown information in this story. If it's a chain and not a small business, this stuff happens all the time based on stringent blanket policies that hold everyone accountable, regardless of value. If this is the case, it should not be a shock. 

It's definitely a shitty way to lose a job, no doubt. Despite this though, if I truly liked my job and wanted to keep it, I would not be taking things that belong to someone else/the company without clearing it first. 

Everyone seems hung up on the fact it was only a euro. Well, would you take a dollar out of the register and pocket it thinking that it was OK? Some employers don't see those two things as different, even if YOU do. 

If it's a small business, I honestly don't see why a warning and compensation wouldn't be sufficient. Otherwise, it happens every day in large businesses."
Your dick is minute.
"OK. This is important for everyone to hear. If you're faced with this again, you turn on the water in your sink and piss in there. It's not pretty, but it's quick, and as long as the water is turned on, there's no smell or mess, and it drowns out the sound. Then you just rinse out/scrub the sink. Also works in dorm rooms when you're too drunk, stoned, naked or antisocial to walk to the bathroom."

I can't stop it, so I just give up and sit there for a while. A minute later (this part was relayed to me after the fact) I was having a seizure on the floor.

My prints turned up on an ATM that had been broken into, you know what happened? the desk sergeant called me and told me exactly why he was calling, asked if i had any idea why my prints were on the ATM, i answered, he politely asked me to come down the station and make a statement, i asked if it was urgent he said not really its just procedure come down when you can. 

This was an actual active police investigation, with evidence linking me to the atm which had been damaged. No squad car, no sirens, no handcuffs, i didn't even go down until 3-4 days later.

But some random calls up, makes an unsubstantiated claim and they full on arrest you, with ZERO evidence of any crime?"

As a matter of fact, I had a multi-usage tool with a knife in it, and I wasn't sure if it was legal (but it is a regular tool for technician). I couldn't put my mind away from some music in my phone that may have been illegal, through I knew they weren't looking for that."

Back in high school, I too started messing with domain level access in my computer lab and found a way to access every other students' folders (each login was assigned a folder from a network drive)

Didn't take me long to figure out that this could easily be used to copy programs during exams (someone else saves his finished program in his folder, and you go and copy it from there). I was obviously excited so I shared this knowledge with all my classmates as well.

Now, a couple weeks later, I'd heard that some creep went into some girl's folder in the junior batch and left a bunch a creepy messages as .txt files. Obviously, she freaked out and reported this to the teacher, and there was a small ordeal over it and I think they removed having network level folders after that.

Clearly this was the fault of the IT guy because he didn't set up the basic security to prevent other users from snooping into each others' stuff, but sometimes I still wonder that if that weirdo from my class hadn't tried that shit, the following years' batches could have still used my trick during exams and my legacy would go on in some form."

"Dude, too real for me. Dated a girl a few years ago who bonded over monster movies and special effects before we met. We go on a few dates, we talk about movies and some special effects stuff I worked on, and a little later I ask her out again when she tells me I'm too obsessed with death and blood and all that stuff and that it's creepy. 

Irony is I'm actually terrified of death and doing monster makeup and special effects is a small part of the art I do, it's just what she kept asking me about.

Chicks, man."

"Now with 50% more debt!

Edit: because of a bunch of comments, this is referring to college having 50% more debt than before in the style of a cheesy consumer ad. It is NOT comparing debt in highschool to debt in college. "

"I wonder if police give those, and can I use it as a hall pass. Like rob a store and if the cops show up just show it to them?

It's actually pretty close to the main character of that movie.
Fun fact: me and a group of friends had a plan to share our stash of cubes and bringing a new cube each day after the previous day had the previous one confiscated. We ended up deciding it was immature and we wanted to be the good guys. + He probably would have suspended us

"I'm expecting a ""thread deleted"" in the near future."
Man don't even worry yourself over it. I've been on a decent amount of tinder and bumble dates and the serial killer part comes up way more then you think. Partly because I'm a tinder serial killer...haha but really we all are afraid of meeting up with this rando we met on an app so we automatically prepare for the worst.
"| Something similar although totally different

What in the fuck did I just read?!"
"I fucking hate this. If you're a super literal person then answering ""I don't think so"" is the only proper response unless you know you have something illegal on you.

 * You're not constantly doing a search of yourself so anything could've been put on you.

 * You're not constantly aware of the current state of every law.

 * Even if you believed you knew about everything that you had on you and you believed none of it was illegal. You couldn't be 100% certain. 

The only logical response is some variant of ""I don't think so"".

This is similar to those stupid road side sobriety tests where the cop asks someone to do something and they respond with 

&gt; I couldn't do that if I was sober

And some people mistakenly interpret this as an admission of them not being sober. When in reality this is just an acknowledgement that the task's purpose is to help the cop deduce the persons sobriety. If the person couldn't do it sober then they also couldn't do it drunk, meaning they would always fail to do it and attempting to perform the task would provide no new information to the cop. The person is just trying to shortcut the task. A clearer but no less accurate way to say this would be:

&gt;I don't think that will help you deduce my sobriety.

But nobody talks like a robot.

EDIT: For a less confrontational example, everytime you're at the hospital and the nurse/doctor asks if you have any alergies there are two possible correct responses. 

  * Yes, these things: ....

  * Not that I know of.

You can't possibly say ""no"" unless you've exposed your body to every known substance and know you have no allergies."
