"Your implants and cry for attention on here only highlight what you and everyone else already suspect... you are insecure.

Likely your insecurity stems from always questioning if you really ever earned anything by merit. Most people probably hand you things because they like looking at you. But that's made you vapid, shallow, and unable to perform  in any way that adds true value in the world.

Your relationships are superficial. Your romance life always has the shadow of doubt. Does he love you... or how you look? If you were disfigured, would anyone give you a second glance based on personality?

That nagging feeling will keep you looking for validation. It keeps you in the gym. It makes you post photos online looking for praise or positive attention. It keeps you going back for a nip here and tuck there. Before long you'll look like Donatella Versace with the personality of one of her handbags. 

You'll shift from being the center of attention to being part of a gaggle of women who make rude comments about younger girls because you feel jealous and rude comments about men who no longer pay attention to you.

You'd be better served working on being a better person than hunting for attention on Reddit, but you'll likely die young and your grave will be about as shallow as your personality.

**Edit**

Well this blew up.

First off, thanks for the gold. 

I do want to ask for the folks being vitriolic in the comments, please give this girl a break. She deleted her account. She was probably just marketing herself and didn't know what she was doing. Other posts outside of a roast someone asks to participate in are a violation of the /r/roastme rules and are generally just not cool.

To those who think I went too far, or was mean and out of line with the nature of the sub... sorry. My sense of humor is dry and I enjoy saying unexpected things. That combination came off as more mean spirited than I generally am. 

A few of you have been doxxing me or the girl who posted this. That is a clear violation of Reddit's TOS and is creepy and possibly illegal depending on how far you're taking it. Don't harass that girl on other accounts if you find her. Just leave it at what it was, a roast."
"We don't care lady.
You were amusement for a day, now it's the next day.

But I imagine you're used to that."

"Are Ex's allowed to post? Well, here it goes:

You wish you were a real actress so people couldn't see right through you. You look like your major in college was gold digging. You might be able to marry rich if you knew what to do with a dick when you see one. You're so desperate for attention you've gone from self-posting on r/prettygirls and r/goddesses to r/roastme. Your little shit of a purse dog is the only true loyalty you'll ever find, and even that is contingent on you continuing to feed it. Your tattoos of guns pointing at your vagina are probably there because the dumb-ass guys you've had to settle for need instructions in finding it under that Demi Moore-inspired bush of yours. You flossed your eyebrows more than a dentist flosses his teeth. Your nipples look like they had a fight with each other and are hiding on the opposite sides of your boobs. You obviously can't take criticism. You will die alone."
"You look like someone who would spend 2 hours on your hair and makeup and take about 50 selfies just to post on r/roastme because you think you'll be the first person in the history of this sub to be so hot that nobody can think of a bad thing to say about you, but that has never happened.

You look like the kind of person who frequents loud dance clubs because the loudness puts you on a level playing field with people who are interesting to talk to."

That's not cleavage it's the Silicon Valley. 
The best Roast would be to not give her attention at all.
I was going to jerk off to this photo. But now I have to jerk off to this comment. Jesus. 
"Lady, you came to /r/roastme and are defending yourself in reply to negative comments. Do you not understand the purpose of this sub?"
It doesn't matter what you say. This will go down in the history of Reddit as The Great Roast
Jesus I'm from /r/all and enjoy RoastMe posts that pop up here and there. But I have never once read a roast this fucking savage before.  
"Jesus Christ, this isn't Chaturbate. Reddit gold doesn't give you actual money."
"shit... the other ones were personal, but this one was *personal* personal"
"Her: Gimme that I have no skills and need to marry for money look 
 
Team of plastic surgeons: Say no more"
"I don't know why you insist and doing  Q&amp;A videos on Instagram. No one gives a shit. We follow you because you're hot, but you're not interesting. Stop deluding yourself.  

Edit: No I won't give you her instagram. Stop messaging me."
That ring light you used for your selfie makes your eyes and narcissism really pop.
"""Apparently I make reddit very angry.""

Guys, I think she's mildly retarded.  "
"I'm not sure the mods have big enough quotations for ""*Celebrity*"""
"Everything about this is way too intentional for the ""fuck it"" pageantry. You want people to think you just wrote some shit down on a card, snapped a quick photo, and threw it to the virgins to shout out your fake tits as masked compliments? It takes more bravery for some regular ass teenager to snarl their brace-face in homeroom than it does for your fake fuck it Instagram lite compliment fishing trip. 

[Private message update](http://imgur.com/a/cWsiO). And as a response: stop using your real name for everything you silly fuck."
The definition of a depreciating asset. 
"Like passing a taco bell and going ""oh yeah I was gonna grab chipotle"""
Damn.... You made her delete the account ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
"You came here to get low-key complimented, then when people actually roasted you you feel the need to explain why they are wrong, because you're too insecure to laugh it off. 

Roll with the punches. It's a roast me, not secretly compliment me in the disguise of an insult. "
I always issue my apologies in full lingerie.
Goddamn
You can't take a roast on twitter how the hell can you on Reddit?
Deleted her account when it hit r/all
[deleted]
"Was she expecting everyone to throw their hands up and say ""oh how could we possibly...""?"
"Could be worse, she could have Keemstar as a father figure."
"You look like every basic ass Kardashian wannabe in this world, draw your eyebrows in thicker please. Just the sight of you screams insecurity to me, you hate yourself so much compliments only serve to devalue the person giving them. You spent two hours getting ready to take this picture and have no plans to even leave the house today. You'll fuck your fill of badboys and then right at 30 settle down with a chump who has been chasing you for years. He'll think he has hit the jackpot, but we both know you aren't worth the sheets he fucks you on. You will continue to get your fill of sexually satisfying attention from men you actually prefer over social media and private messaging apps like kik while sitting in the Mercedes your mealticket bought you. Eventually you'll have his kid, locking in this lifestyle forever. You'll end up fucking some of your meal ticket's friends or worse, family, because the dirty validation seeking slut that comes out after a few drinks is the real you. He'll forgive you because he's a bitch.

"I'd roast you, but I don't have the $350 you charge per hour."
"""deeply disturbing *penisgraphic* DM's"" "
what about that girl so fat that the top roast was a heartfelt advice about how to get help?
tfw your r/RoastMe thread doesn't even reach top spot bc some girl with fake tits wanted to get compliments and we made her delete her account
"If this were a game of marry, fuck, kill I'd fuck the girl, marry the comment, and kill myself because I'd know I've peaked.

Edit: Holy shit my first gold!! Also I fixed my misspelling of peaked because I am a weak, weak man."
"I bet the title of this post is roughly 66% of your active vocabulary. The other 33% being the word ""me""."
"I don't know why you posted here, honestly. Plenty of other prominent ""e-celebrities"" have roasted you with more thought and care than any one Reddit comment ever could. Maybe it's your hubris and fame-mongering that leaves you to continually scrape and claw at your own venomous, vapid relevance knowing more than anyone that your clock is ticking, both as someone in your career field as well as a father. Your daughter will grow-up see how you presented yourself to others and probably feel a great amount of disgust at the idea that her life was built on a foundation of the superficial goings-on of superficial people. Most likely she will cut contact with you as she matures much like a majority of people who take an interest in you, and as your once primped and pointed beard becomes grey and withered you will realize what you really are: Old and a-gnome."
People who roast like this have peered into the abyss and have had it stare back.

"This must be an old photo, she couldn't heal those 3rd degree burns that fast.."

"I agree it was getting toxic and Reddit's angry virgins were definitely showing ... but I don't agree that roastme comments always have to be light-hearted ... I mean, the best roasts tend to cut straight to the core, you know? That's part of what makes it fun."

Yeah she already got nuked of the planet.
"deleted her reddit account and went back to the Periscope echo chamber where she's showered in compliments by white knights and orbiters. Guess she never expected what she thinks about herself deep down to be posted here by random people. 

Probably still reading here while the losers on periscope go unanswered and can't figure out why they never get the attention they deserve. 

EDIT: She made a new account and PM'd me around 2AM CST. Definitely still here reading the comments. "

"Seriously, did she expect people to not completely shit on her in a subreddit dedicated to insults?










Edit: I did not expect so many replies to this comment. Doxxing is unacceptable and the mods all over Reddit do an excellent job at trying to prevent it. However when posting your photo on a public forum and using the same username as your other accounts, you should realize the risk that comes along with it. Especially if you are an outlier (i.e. Someone especially good looking on a subreddit that's encouraged to rip you a new one.)"

"This subreddit is hilarious. I found this sub like a year ago when this ""roasting"" thing became internet popular, and I left after a week or so when every semi-attractive girl got told the exact same things about her. Daddy issues, shallow, no personality, insecure, gold-digger, vapid, some insults about her eyebrows and makeup. Every post, without fail,  the same comments

Come across this sub again from an /r/bestof post and surprise, this ""omg the most epic roast in this sub's history"" was basically a conglomeration of the same stereotypes this place was giving girls over a year ago

And then to top it all off, this girl is a ""fashion model"" who knew how this subreddit would react to her pics and would get her a shit-ton of attention. And, like clockwork, she starts posting about it on her Instagram because she got the attention she always wanted and this place gave it to her, and of course makes her post about in a lingerie shot with her boobs and ass out in the open.

She even says ""Yes, I did ask for this"" because she knew what would come from it, and this subreddit gave her what she was seeking and is too stupid to recognize it. She'll probably get even more Instagram followers and modeling work strictly because of this.

Great work fam."

This is what I see that is roastable. Hating on your because you are hot and learned how to do make-up, groom your brows, and know how to pick out flattering clothing is easy. But I can tell from that pic that you are living a cookie cutter apartment. Maybe a one-bedroom, but probably sharing with some roomies; 2 of whom are equally as hopelessly lost in the here-and-now and maybe one who will get out, get married, and move on with her life. You will continue down the path of buying what you want right now and build no equity in your life. Hopefully you will find a rich professional willing to put up with your poor sense of humor long enough to make the mistake of proposing, so you can get out with his house and a kid you will emotionally neglect.

Thankfully at least your tits are big enough to draw attention away from your face.

"Reddit really can't handle teasing.

RoastMe is a fine idea, but some people really can't stand pretty girls -- and no matter how you slice it, she is pretty. From the tenor of her instagram post, she seems like a chill enough person too. Some people managed to make up jokes (that tread the same territory they always do with pretty girls), while others really did just spew their own insecurities -- ie ""get mad.""

But RoastMe isn't alone.

The concept of ""cringe"" started out with some sympathy for people, but it turned into ""make fun of socially awkward people, people who embrace liberal views too strongly, and ugly people.""

PC Master Race started out tongue in cheek, but it's full of real arrogance now (and bragging about multi-thousand dollar computers while championing the idea of a $300 gaming machine)."

It's the same thing with the hate-bandwagons that so often surround popular people. You get one person who says that they met or knew someone who met [...] and they weren't very nice to them that one time, so clearly they're just an awful person.

"If you suck your cheeks in any further, your face is going to implode... and we'd all be grateful."
"Oof. My first thought when i saw the pic was ""oh she looks like a sweet person that would be a great friend, really hope people won't demolish her too hard"".

Then i read your comment. Foreshadowing?"
Is your therapist six years old?
Did Make a Wish give you that jersey?
None of you are on top bunk because all of you are bottoms.
You're a faggot 
"You run a channel that nobody likes because you talk about drama about a dying plataform for revenue, and the fact that you're a grown up adult just adds up to the patetic image you have. I don't think it's necessary to roast you because Idubbbz said it all. Get your shit together and stop being a child, and for fucks sake take that gnome beard out of your face, there's enough shit in there for that thing to stay.

"One of the few reasons I prefer to look at men getting roasted over women is the fact that people are actually funny and creative when roasting men. The majority of the comments on a woman are about how she has sex a lot (which is somehow bad), or is plastic looking for attention. With 3 or 4 actually funny roasts lingering in the comments. All the rest will be unfunny, and almost mean to the point where I'm wondering why these people lash out so hard. The prettier the woman, the worse it is too. Medium attractive girls get some funny comments, and the disfigured and plain ugly are the ones that actually get funny roasting comments (with the additional side of ""lol u can't get laid"", which confuses me because they ream the prettier ones for having sex)."
"Jesus Christ.  That was so savage, I am pretty sure that it could be considered a war crime.   
That said, this is one of the best roasts I have ever read."
"Can't wait to see the comments on this one. 

Love me some roast gnome."
Dude those are the best mains in Super Can't Smash Bros.
"Guy makes a compilation of roasts targeted at random girl #1, gets roasted non-stop for (incredibly shitty) graphic design knowledge/skill.

This is even more meta than I thought."
I don't know... you've set the bar so low there's no way you could limbo under it with the twenty pounds of plastic and saline on your chest.
Love it. So true.

You can put your finger away. We already know the only reason you are no longer a virgin is because that finger slipped through the toilet paper when you wiped your ass.
Do you find yourself being drawn to minecraft because it let's you live out your ancestors legacy as antiquated farm equipment?

"One comment that just says ""No"" would have been good."
"one was from the alleged ex https://reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/6aeian/fuck_it/dhekbpd/

the other one was just....brutal https://reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/6aeian/fuck_it/dhe36ch/

not sure why they were so low at the bottom since it has so many points"
Wtf anyone that owns a dog can't be a bad person? What does that even mean? You guys are both honestly probably just LA psychopaths
"''""""""Celebrity""""""''"
"You do realize that these aren't literal guesses about your life, right? They're roasts based purely on your looks and how you present yourself in the comments. So far, you've managed to prove every roast right. "
I think my wife might get pissed if dropped 4k to get an even bigger set of tits.
It's a phase when your a teenager...it's called trash now.

This was the first comment to make me laugh loudly in months.
"damn feels a little bad for OP cos this got out of hand.... 

i'm guessing OP was used to getting only compliments on instagam and thought reddit would be the same but still, those two comments were brutal"
This is too specific... did this happen?
