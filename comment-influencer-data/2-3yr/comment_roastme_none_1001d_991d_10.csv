"Clockwise from the top:

2. Blonde: has slept with 2/5 of the guys but they don't know they're Eskimo bros. 
3. Young Gus: your father owns a franchise called Los Pollos Hermanos. Once you get your fine arts degree, you'll spend the rest of your life working the cash register... has slept with the blonde. 
4. Single, Red Shirt: Constantly complains about being single and calls girls bitches for not texting him back. They never do. 
5. Comic Con Don: (bottom) You still play Pokemon go. 
6. Emo Kid: guilted the blonde into sleeping with him or else he'd end it all. Lasted 30 seconds before crying about his ex high school girlfriend.
7. Red Head: practices in the mirror repeating everything said on MSNBC. Balances on ropes tied between trees. Still claims Bernie has a shot."
"The fact that you have such large breasts at such a young age probably means you received too much positive attention on your looks, driving you focus more on the way you look in order to continue getting that attention. Soon that attention will be the only thing that will get you out of bed in the morning. You will find yourself not giving schooling enough attention instead opting to party and have fun. Eventually you will end up with a minimum wage job and probably pregant at a very early age wondering why life sucks. You will probably end up dying from breast cancer because you couldn't afford health insurance and die at a young age. Statistically speaking you don't stand a chance.

Developed a nasty coke habit, 'cause she loved the way it made her feel. Mm-hmm. Extreme highs gave way to extreme lows and she fell into a depression. Had herself a kid. Thought it would give her a sense of purpose. And it did, for a while, until she started using again. Mm-hmm. And then social services came knocking at the door, and now the kid lives upstate with his grandparents, 'cause she can't take care of this kid. And here she is festering away in a one-bedroom apartment waiting for the HIV to turn into AIDS. And wondering what the hell..."
