0,"Yes, the law suit filed against the hospital was won due to evidence against the he doctors"
1,"Is there any evidence linking the delayed birth with the disabilities?
"
2,...Really? It's in the title...
3,"We were both born northern Canada. There was a malpractice law suit, four years before a settlement was made. 
The staff were protected by the hospital and the doctors are still in practice today. I'm not sure what happened to the front line staff or how they were impacted. "
4,So that his supporters could delete questions that undermine his position or point out his ridiculousness.
5,but why male models?
6,Seriously?? What country was she born at? Malpractice lawsuit? What happened to the stacf that dropped the ball? 
7,Wanna hook up?
8,You know what - there were.  And thats what kills you as a teacher.  They deserve an education and they aren't getting one.  Give me 30 kids who don't care and i'll just baby sit them and collect me pay check.  Give me 29 who don't care and one who does and i'm gonna keep busting my ass everyday for that one kid.
9,"Several actually. For one, i have often felt that the innate desire to please a higher power makes societies be very charitable. In Pakistan, charities and public funding are massive sources of capital for a lot of things. The healthcare system benefits the most, there are dozens of excellent quality hospitals that provide free care to deserving people. There is a dedicated cancer care institution with such a vast influx of donations that it perpetually runs the most expensive medical services completely free of cost. One of the largest ambulance networks in the world is here too and its entirely run on charity money.  "
10,"The doctors denied everything. 
During court, my mother had another child at the same hospital and the hospital conducted illegal tests on this child to determine whether or not my older sisters disabilities were a result of genetics. 
The doctors denied this too.
The same doctors lawyers began providing facts from the birth of a baby that was not my sister.
The doctors had no notes to provide for my sisters birth. The hospital had no records of the birth. But extensive notes of the care she required after her birth. 
The doctors tried to blame my parents for my sisters disabilities. 
The law suit drew out for four years before a settlement was reached. "
11,"Culture of the school plays a huge part. I work in the shittiest neighborhood, when we go on field trips the kids act ok, when they come back to the school they go bonkers. It is all about the culture."
12,"That would definitely be when we first arrived.  My fiance walked out of the room to go to the pool 5 minutes after we got there, while I remained cowering in the lodge room for a while.  Oddly enough, it was my 24 year old son who encouraged me (via text), saying, ""Mom, those people are not there to judge you.  They're there for peace.""  He was absolutely right.  Where I was, clothes are allowed everywhere except in the pool and hot tubs.  I walked out to the pool with a towel around me, then mustered up the courage to remove the towel while lying down, because things look better when you're lying flat (at least to women).  Since it was 100 degrees, after about 5 minutes I just said screw it, and got up and walked to the pool.  After that initial fear was gone, I was naked for the remainder of the time.  We were only supposed to be there for 2 days, but ended up staying 5 because the people were so nice and it was just so damn peaceful.   

Edit:  To elaborate, the second night they had a dance.  I got up on stage completely naked, in front of 150 strangers, and proposed to my boyfriend.  I'm not sure I would do that completely clothed in my normal life, but it's so nice there, it didn't even occur to me until the next day just how unlike me that scene was.  "

15,I think fearing islam creates a new set of problems that would lead to further alienation for a group of people that do not necessarily share a homogeneous school of thought. So while in some cases such fears are fairly deserved(isis and al qaeda being worthy examples of this) generalising that fear to every single person following the religion is also wrong. It only further increases the divide that breeds extremism 
16,I've given out more than I've gotten ;)
17,This is the million dollar question isn't it.  I think the buck stops with the parents.  If the IDEA of education is not elevated at home then we are already on the back foot from the word go.  
18,What caused the damage?  I think that's why people are confused.
19,I usually just shit in the ocean
20,Yes. I have travelled a lot and so far in every country they hate us. Many times I actually pretended I was white or Spanish or something. My mother told one of her best friends that she's gypsy after 2 years of friendship and she acted like everything is fine but she stopped talking to her ever since. Sad story huh?
21,Meanwhile Hillary is nearing 300 days without a press conference. 
22,You may as well ask for an AMA with Mewtwo. You've got just as much chance of it happening. 
23,"I think people need to understand that the issue was the medical staff not monitoring the baby. If this was properly done then they would have known the baby was in difficulty and performed an emergency C-section. Every second that they wasted watching the games put that baby's life at risk as she was slowly being strangled by the umbilical cord. The longer that goes on for the higher risk there is to the unborn baby. 

So they did delay the birth- remember that not all births go smoothly and often complications arise when someone is in labor. If this was dealt with quickly like it should have been then OPs sister would likely have been unaffected. Since it wasn't dealt with quickly it was delayed. "
24,That's the funny thing - they had no real reason to act the way they did.  The school was in a working class area but they were certainly not destitute children by any measure.
25,"&gt;Thanks for the question, but I'd really prefer to keep this thread non-political!

Soooo, the last ""A"" in ""AMA"" referred to.........what?"
26,"I have to be very careful discussing her because too many details might reveal who she is, and just mentioning her seems to bring her back in to my orbit, but to give an analogy - she's basically like Tammy 2 in 'Parks &amp; Rec', but with none of the redeeming features or hotness, just all of the spite and manipulation.

A few things to illustrate the point:

* She never wore tampons/pads during her period so her jeans where absolutely disgusting.  I also ended up replacing sheets on the reg.

* When we were back state-side, we had an apartment together for six months and she left the country a month before our lease was up, leaving me to move everything into a storage unit, clean the apartment and whatnot.  
   * In the above apartment, she spent an insane amount of time in the bath-tub, to the point of where she wouldn't get out of it to urinate, she would simply drain out the water and refill.
   * When I was cleaning up the apartment to move out, i was cleaning the bathtub, and discovered a turd in the drain... so yeah, she apparently pooped in the bathtub and didn't clean it out.
  * While I thought she was in Ecuador, she actually came back into the country and was shacking up with a guy she met on a cruise a few months earlier... while we were still dating, and I was taking care of all this shit.  I found this out because she was still logged in to her email on my laptop, and he had written her a love-email while she was sleeping next to him.

so yeah, a real charmer

"
27,"&gt; She never wore tampons/pads during her period so her jeans where absolutely disgusting. 

...shudders..."
28,"Another mother's child died due to doctor negligence on the same day my sister was denied care. 
My sisters charts were not monitored, nor were they properly documented. Two other newborns documents were included in my sisters file during their case.  One document was her death certificate; Stating she had died due to lack of oxygen in the womb. 
My Sister acquired CP and a developmental delay as a result of perinatal brain cell death. 
My sister's ambilical cord was wrapped around her throat and the charts monitoring fetus distress fluctuate in and out of the extremes for over five hours. 
After my sister's birth she was taken and my mother was told she had died. My sister was held at the hospital for two weeks before my mother was notified. 

The woman next to my mother in the hospital was told her newborn had died and that charting had gotten confused.

Court details beyond this are sealed. I don't know any more information as these are the facts my parents have provided me with....well shit, I never questioned the facts of my sister's birth before. 



 "
29,Sounds like a real Hillary move. 
30,"Personally, i would leave. Maybe thats just a state of mind. But i think i would choose to leave since i am not sure people actually want the situation changed. These rules norms and laws are to a large degree a reflection of collective belief system in the region. "
31,It was white. I ran it under the water and now it's brown
32,Yep.  We had a behaviour 'specialist' in and he concluded that we lacked a clear 'vision'.  Changing culture is very difficult when all the same people/buildings are still there.  The reason I say buildings is because the school is genuinely run down and not a great place to be aesthetically.  When I have visited similar schools but with far better buildings there is a noticeably different 'feel' about the place.  More pride and purpose.  
33,"At least once a day I was taken from my cell (I was shuffled around between cells a few times) into the basement of the detention center and put into one of several windowless rooms, with just a metal desk and two chairs, and really bright fluorescent lights overhead.  I was handcuffed to one of the chairs, and left alone for what i guess would be about 20 minutes.  Afterward, one of the guards would come in and ask the same questions in the same order, every day, and take notes on everything i said.  This was all in English, which is important, because the fluency of the guards varied wildly, and because the whole reason for them doing this every day was to probe my story for inconsistencies, it created some unnecessary drama.

The questions that were asked were:

* What have you been doing in China all this time (at which point I had to recount pretty much everything I've done over the last 3 years, any time i left the country, etc. etc.)

* How did I get the 'fake visa'? (Who did I bribe, etc. because apparently the visa agency i used had bribed an official in qingdao for the visas)

* Was I a: spy, smuggler, drug dealer, pimp (seriously)

* If I wasn't a spy, how did I get the fake visa?  Also, why is the state department so interested in me?

and just more of that cyclical questioning until the guard was satisfied

Then they'd ask about things going on in the detention center, like if they had found contraband (which was usually stuff like playing cards and pretty mundane stuff)

When they were done, the guard would leave, I'd be left sitting there for awhile again, then a different guard would take me back to my cell.  The whole process usually took about an hour and half.  

They never threatened me with violence, they didn't need to directly. A few occasions I could hear the guards beating the living hell out of someone in another room in the basement.  All the keys to the cells/rooms were on what I would best describe as a metal painters palate, and the guards would basically 'whip' the detainees with them on the arms, legs and back leaving pretty bad cuts and lacerations on the detainee :("
34,"And *that* is what the general public needs to see. You *can't* teach students who don't want to learn and your chances of changing their mind are pretty much zero. I do feel bad for those who don't want to learrn, but in the end, they made their own choice."
35,Well...Juliette Lewis did reply to my question on her AMA...and tell me that I'm sweet.  So I got that going for me...

38,"Since I had just thought of doing it that morning and we were out in the middle of nowhere, I didn't have a ring.  However, I rode 30 minutes to the nearest town and found a necklace with a meditational charm that the Indian guy said was symbolic for a content heart.  I thought it was appropriate.  He hasn't taken it off yet.  :-)  "
39,"God, this is a stupid AMA request. "
40,Those healthcare services aren't really free if you pay with your rights.

42,"Usually it's premature birth that results in disabilities. I've never heard of a delay causing disabilities. I guess if the umbilical cord was wrapped around the baby's neck and the doctors delayed, yeah that might cause some issues. But that's a specific situation. Without more information, we really don't know. "
43,Yes!!  And he cried like a baby.  It was adorable.

45,"I have no real feelings towards the Olympics. My sister and I watch the Para-olympics but for the most part we don't watch TV. 
We play sports together, like wheelchair baseball. I help her bat and then push her around the bases in her chair.

46,This AMA is gonna be yuge. Is it true Donald knows so many words? I heard him say he knows all the words.
47,"You could always try hitting on guys yourself? I've tried this with women and after a while your skin gets thicker and it gets easier.

Edit: it may worth noting, just because guys aren't hitting on you doesn't mean they don't like you. Men get shy with this stuff too."

50,"Well i'd never been called a cunt before this school so that was a new low point!  I'm a pretty big guy so things never get too crazy out of control in my classroom but plenty of other teachers have been threatened with violence or had kids come up to them and make as if to hit them in order to get a reaction.  Honestly the relentlessness of the smaller issues are what kills you - graffiti, swearing, defiance, the fucking state they leave your classroom in"
51,"I haven't attended in 4 years. I can't handle organized religion right now, and not sure if I ever will again. The church made me have this awful guilty conscience that led me to start rebelling. I was judged a lot and the gossip was endless. I resent a lot of what the church did to me and my family. "
52,"If they're in northern Canada, there's an okay chance that it's the only hospital around. "
53,"Looks like an obvious pussy move, though. The_Donald is a huge circle jerk that bans anyone that says something that doesn't fit in. They don't just remove the post, mind you, they outright ban you. The questions that will be asked and answered will be akin to Simpsons' parody: *""Mr. Burns, Your Campaign Seems To Have the Momentum of a Runaway Freight Train. Why Are You So Popular?”*

It makes Trump's AMA look weak. Low energy."
54,"I asked what he meant when he said he hopes Russia would hack hillary and it was promptly deleted and a response was given by a moderator, instead of him, privately.

Disappointing"
55,"The Olympics were playing on TV at the hospital in 1984. Doctors at the hospital were watching TV. My sister was born in 1984. My sister's brain and body slowly died in my mother's womb while the doctors watched TV, ignoring their job obligations to deliver my sister. And as a result of their ignorance and TV watching, my older sister became permanently physically and intellectually disabled. "

58,"It's the same as in every other ethnicity. We have good people and bad people. A lot of people don't tell they are gypsy so maybe thats why the bigger focus is on the bad ones. However, gypsies nowadays study, get educated and have their job- if possible, because of racism a lot of job opportunities get turned down for us. I have several stories about how my dad went for an interview and they didn't accept him just because they knew he was gypsy ( Where I'm from we have a high volume of gypsies so people can already tell who is and who isn't). When it's possible we have a stable job. When not we rely on social support because we have no other choice. "
59,i once sat on a mr potato head. it was by accident but it was kinda hot.
60,"They said it was because the rainout last night, I had to go and exchange my tickets at the ticket office (Mind you I was 1st in line). I was first over to the ticket office, the guy told me to go back to the gates because the scanners were having an issue and I didn't need to exchange tickets. Then the ticket scanners at the gate told me I HAVE to exchange tickets. Mind you, while all this is happening about 1,000 people have lined up to exchange tickets. Then 30 minutes before 1st pitch the tickets disappeared off the StubHub app. Now I'm watching the game on Tv, where there looks to be 400 people in the stands."

67,"Valid point. But for those who have never known a different reality, those who dont think of this as a sacrifice of rights and celebrate being part of this system, for them the idea of free medical care is nothing short of a 21st century miracle "
68,"My parents had 4 more children after my sisters birth. She lives at home with my parents and she goes to a day program for adults with disabilities. She cannot walk and has a small verbal vocabulary. 
I'm 7 years younger than my sister, so life with her has been my normal. My eldest siblings had a harder time. 
Now that my parents are ageing, it is getting harder and I will most likely take over custody soon "
69,"This is a bit controversial, and I'd like to preface with that is not meant as negative. Just speculation. Do you believe transexualism can be a form of body dismorphia? Trans people face problems, such as suicide rates, that are on par with people with mental illness"
70,"Yep - big time.  In a department of 9, 4 quit outright and one went part time to re-train for another profession.  The school literally broke teachers!  Annoyingly I didn't get an exit interview as strictly speaking I was on maternity cover contract.  So i didn't so much quit as say ""hell no"" when they asked me to stay!"
71,Dafuq is this shit 
72,"Actually not that often to be honest. Maybe once a year you would hear of a mob lynching incident and that too in a slightly specific context that i will explain in a bit. But the main reason for that is the reflexive concealment of such opinions in society. I cant think of any outspoken or 'openly critical of religious values' kind of atheist in the country. There are atheists, but they would tend to hide this view from the majority and only open up about it in certain circles. That usually does not involve families since a vast majority of families actually prefer adhering to predefined religious and cultural norms. However if we change the statement from 'i dont believe in god' to 'i dont like god' then the color changes quickly. Because now we have entered the area that can legally be interpreted as blasphemy. And thats a seriously punishable offence. So much so that in fact most of the times, angry zealots dont even need to carry mob justice. They can very easily slap a label of blasphemy and watch the legal system consume the accused party."
