0,"Wow that is an amazing story. You were kidnapped and held as a sex slave, then killed your captor after you found you were pregnant. Within a very short time, less than 6 months, you secured a deal and wrote a book about your ordeal. And now you are pregnant with the child of the kidnapper, who you killed, and intend to live a new life with complete privacy despite publishing a book about it.

You are an amazing strong person.
"
1,"All of your comments go back and forth, one says you were 22, then 23, now you're 24, all within the same ordeal. This whole timeline starts off at 22, you had a ""big break at college"" then 3 months later...  How can you start the ordeal at 22, and be 6 months pregnant, and 24 now, when the whole situation only could have taken placed 7 months back.  
So lets do this, she's 22, now. starting college? break?  
So, lets start with 22, you are now, 22 years old as you have stated.

3 months later? i'm guessing the whole situation happened with the ""kidnapping""

The Sex dungeon lasted ""30 days"" before you ""escaped.?

You escaped, but injured him, requiring him to get a transplant, (LOL and skip the whole waiting list that was there prior)Thereafter he was in the hospital for 2 months, then died after medical procedures.

Bish you don't even know shit about DNA testing, fuck you talking baby pregnancy test getting DNA test, bitch, for them to get your baby's DNA, they have to get to YOUR BABY

So Obviously you're six months Pregnant, lets rewind the time back. So you stated that he died four months back...

Combo Sauce: http://imgur.com/GcKURhM
  
Which makes the time line BROKEN, as how can he die 4-5 Months ago? because he lived for 2 months after you critically ""injured him"" all while you're 6 months pregnant? if you were 8 months pregnant, sure it would be more believable but, simple math does not LIE.  
  
But let's dig deeper into this thing, because fuck you bitch, people get raped and shit all the time and you claim this happened to you and shit, you don't know the impact of this shit. and yet you try to brush it off as if you did go through such an event to make a shitty book, or worse make people care about you, we don't, we care about compassion for the unspeakable act people have been put through because they themselves would not want to be go through that, that part I understand, but for you to come in here and straight up lie, fuck you to the deepest level of your grave.  
  
You say you were from chicago, then say that you aren't, then say that you're a ""WHITE FOSTER KID"" from Ugunda...?  
Then say you're not in the USA, so that narrows you down quite a bit actually.

So let's look at the LIST of legal same sex marriage countries because obviously : http://imgur.com/Eq8SKi4  
Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Mexico,[nb 1] the Netherlands,[nb 2] New Zealand,[nb 3] Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom,[nb 4] the United States[nb 5] and Uruguay. Same-sex marriage is likely to soon become legal in Taiwan, after a constitutional court ruling in May 2017.[1] Furthermore, legislation allowing same-sex marriage in Germany passed the Bundestag on 30 June 2017 and is expected to go into effect in late 2017.[2] Polls show rising support for legally recognizing same-sex marriage in the Americas, Australia and most of Europe.[3][4][5] However, as of 2017, South Africa is the only African country where same-sex marriage is recognized. Taiwan would become the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage if the Civil Code is amended. Israel and Armenia recognise same-sex marriages performed overseas for some purposes.[6][7]

You stated some hateful stuff about your countrie's disdain towards America.

Obviously there are a lot of countries that would be considered hostile to America in some ways, may it be culture, or past wars, or present issues.  
Supposedly you're in one of these countries then.

2,"Guys, can we just talk about Rampart?"
3,You are putting out a book about the details of a crime that happened to you and the location of where this took place is a violation of your privacy?
4,"Lol @ some of their reviews:

""The experience I went through is something worth talking about. The relocation was so peaceful. I noticed that the movers were so organized. They had a clear plan of how the relocation was to be carried. They were very careful in ensuring everything worked as planned. In the end, I had nothing but smiles.""

Yeah, all of their positive reviews are fake and their negative reviews are...telling. That company is pure shit and needs to be taken out. "
5,Do you mean as in puberty? If so yup! I have an identical twin sister and we were both developing normally but she had her period around 12 or 13. My parents took me to the doctors a few years later because we normally did everything around the same time. That's how they started my diagnosis! 
6,"if this is not real,   I am really royally pissed off.   I remember asking a question about my REAL attack and trial,  on here,   when I really needed help and support.   I was not allowed to post my question without giving details of my name,   case,   etc. --   I mean specific PROOF tihat I was going to have to testify in court and lie about having been abused and strangled.   Of COURSE I was terrified to give details like that  (and thank God I never did,   because I am scared to this day for good reason which is why I did make the decision to lie in court)  and now you are on here,   with no apparent evidence of who YOU say you are.   Screw the internet and screw you Reddit."
7,"""You've got a lot to learn about this town sweetie."""
8,"Hmmmm at first not being able to have children was the hardest part. Even at a young age I knew I wanted to be a mum and that a woman growing another life inside her body was the closest thing to a miracle ill ever see. I still get emotional seeing pregnant women but over the last couple of years my views have changed a bit and I might not even want children. And of course I've realized the beauty of adoption too. 

Other than that the whole being so ""different"" aspect was pretty depressing!! Growing up as a woman i was told you'll turn a certain age and hit puberty and have your period and one day have babies. And when i didn't i automatically became different from every woman I've ever met. Being different seemed a whole hell of alot like being broken. I was never told there was another option so it felt very very isolating. 

When i first found out I wasn't ashamed or shy and had no problems talking to anyone who asked about it.  I very quickly realized the majority of people had no interest in learning they were simply asking to spread rummors or to bully and isolate me. Most of the bullying was directed towards me not being able to have sex and even though I've dilated some of those comments stick with me to this day. 

I eventually ""came to terms"" with the diagnosis and realized any one willing to bully me for not growing the right organs before I was even born is nothing but an ignorant ass looking to bully me because they dislike themselves. No matter what anyone could say about me now i believe educating people is worth the risk. I know if I had heard of even 1 woman with mrkh when i was diagnosed it would have helped me so so much. So now I just try and spread the word and hope that a father or mother or sister or brother etc will stumble upon my posts and can help a very scared, lonely, depressed young girl have a little better experience than I had!

9,Well that's just one secret I can't divulge. It's a complicated and elaborate system in place....... u pull them
10,"Good christ, you're a pathological liar."
11,"It's disgusting that men are supposed to just ""suck it up"" when it comes to abuse. I'm so very sorry you had to go through that."
12,"So I speak Polish and English and there was another girl in the Ward that spoke both of those too. She was from Poland, moved to the U.S. as a teen and then learned English. Because she learned English later in life it was stored in a different part of her brain. When her brain was ""operating in English"" she was psychotic. Hallucinating, having delusions, she was violent, she would accuse other patients of hurting her with their minds. When she was ""operating"" in Polish i.e. speaking and thinking in Polish she was fine. The only problem was she wasn't aware of the problem or I'm sure she'd try not to use English. 
What's even crazier is that none of the staff in the hospital spoke polish so they had no idea she was okay while thinking in Polish. I only noticed because I'd hear her talking on the phone with her family in Polish,making total sense, saying that she didn't know why she was in the hospital but knew it had to do with her brain injury. When she was speaking Polish to me she was just a ""normal"" girl. If we talked in English I was ""melting her insides with the hate in my brain"".
I tried telling the nurses and they dismissed be as I was also a patient and not to be trusted but after they got to know me and trust me they got a translator, waited for her to ""go Polish"" and then talked to her through the translator. She was moved to neurology a few hours later."
13,*hug* you're an amazing person
14,From Rape to Escape? Is it co-authored by Dr. Seuss?
15,"My mom would teach me a lot about Wiccan stuff. I remember huge chests and boxes filled with little vials of oils and herbs everywhere. The house always smelled like incense and some sweet smelling herb that I can't remember the name of. The house was also always very dark. We had dark red curtains and we were super poor so the lights were always off to save electricity. Instead of working to earn a living, my mom would do weird spells and put stuff in the vials. I remember she had a money spell where she put a rolled up dollar bill in a class vial with almond oil or something else that smelled sweet. I remember holding the vial and wanting the dollar SO BAD but she told me if I took it out we would never get money again lol. SO MUCH weird stuff. We also had a pet pig. "
16,I just graduated college a month ago and started working as a junior paralegal. I want to go to law school next fall. 
17,That was day one stuff the trick is learning what's in where. I still looked in wrong drawers 
18,"Look I don't know either way, but this whole thing really just... reeks.  This is less about you not having proof and more about this story just having so many unbelievable things in it all at once.  You were gone for a month, so people must have been looking for you, but you got them to keep quiet about all that.  You came into a police station and told them you were kidnapped and raped, but unlikely that you showed signs of either one as you were Stockholm in record time and having willing sex (which you graphically described) as well as you confessed to violently attacking someone, but the police kept quiet too.  This to the point they sent over emergency services to his home (I assume?) and you say he's a college boy.  It's possible he's all alone in the world, but unlikely, so where did he get this huge love chamber with a one way mirror in it when he's barely old enough to own property?  Where are his parents and why didn't anyone in *his* family say anything while he's laid up in the hospital for 2 months and eventually **died** from a violent altercation?  Not to mention they had to be informed at that point if no time before that he was a suspect in an ongoing investigation into the kidnap, rape, and torture of a young girl.  Yet through all of this you managed to silence the police, the entire hospital, your family, *his* family, the press never got wind of any of it, and all so you could get a ""book deal"" through... Amazon?  The institute of self-publishing authors?

Look, I'm not going to go hard on a decision here, but you have to admit all of these questions look like real shit when they all apply to the same story.  I haven't even covered them all as we haven't even touched upon your blatantly gratuitous sexual descriptions and the fact that you were obviously apprehended in a violent manner on a public street in broad daylight (I guess any witnesses stayed quiet about that too, or the police suppressed their reports as part of your book deal?).  

You just have to understand where people are coming from here.  If this isn't a total yarn, it's a story for the ages.  EDIT: I'll admit I'm leaning more towards yarn especially when this is all just apparent book hype for you, who is also going wishy-washy on what you can and cannot share with mostly regards to ""not spoiling the book"" and anyone can tell you that the biggest fallback to publishing on Amazon is lack of hype."
19,That is exactly what I  meant! wow a identical twin an a ultra rare condition.  Buy a lottery ticket! 
20,"I'll say, cause I'm calling bulshit. How about this as a question, do you have a link to a news story?"
21,That's some sauce right there
22,"How long did it take you to learn where the hidden drawers were? (Not secret, just hidden from sight)"
23,Well when I first found out I was unable to have sex! I had to stretch the skin where my vaginal canal should have been using things called dilators. They're basically different sized dildos starting out about as small as a pinky finger. I had to press them into me until it stretched out the skin and eventually I could move up in size to a bigger one etc! So I can have sex normally now but its quite painful sometimes! 
24,"Another gem:

""I had no serious issues hiring out these movers. I simply made a call, spoke to one of their sales agent, and that was it. The rest of the processes were easy and fascinating. I love that. I am so happy they were there for me when I needed them most. The relocation services were so ideal. I ended up relocating within a shorter time than I had expected. Even more, the services were carried out without any mistakes. I am so proud of Long Distance Van Lines crew. They are so adorable!""

What a bunch of fucks."
25,Yes a lot of them actually. There are different levels when it comes to discounts. The first is always 10% in store. The other discounts is done through a web portal. 15% for family and friends 25% for personal. There is also an option for additional 500 off a Mac and 250 for iPads that u can use once every 3 years. A lot of the vendors as well give discounts to employees through their own affiliate websites. 
26,I'm not even sure you could *read* a book. Much less write one...
27,"I keep getting down-voted. I wonder if it's because the content/my experience is boring (fair and valid) or if there are feminist, anti-MRA men and women on Reddit who simply don't like hearing about men's experiences with DV...?

*Edit, typo."
28,"To be fair, this sub isn't for asking questions about things, it's for hosting Q&amp;A's. If you want help, there's /r/legaladvice and other subreddits for that purpose. Don't hate reddit if you don't know how to use it properly."
29,When I was first diagnosed I only had an inch or two and they call that a vaginal dimple 😊 but I started dilating with dilators and naturally through whatever penetration my boyfriend and I could get until I had enough vaginal length for normal sex 😊  So I basically diyed myself a vaginal canal 😂😂
30,So not really an ask me *any*thing then eh? I tried googling but couldn't find your book. When is it coming out?
31,"I understand, I'm just trying to figure out if this is bullshit or not. Not a question but more of a comment, it's allowed, not aloud."
32,Developmentally did you mature?
33,Honestly that was kinda required lol when we were practicing before taping they made us ask for a letter as obnoxiously loud as possible
34,Was there a rat with cooking abilities that helped you land the job? How are you hiding it?
35,So far so good they've been showing me the ropes and i seem to have fitted in quite well. I even signed my contract today. The place is a noodle restaurant. iv'e made enough instant noodles in my life so should be fine :)
36,Why? In what way would it ruin your book?
37,[deleted]
38,"So, I myself was raised in a some what bizarre circumstances as well (probably not nearly as bad as you, however). I haven't had physical contact with another Human being outside of the people I live with, for a very, very, long time; Did you have a lot of social anxiety dealing with ""normal"" people? If so, how did you over come it? I'd like to know ..."
39,Oh it definitely did not work lol none of the spells worked because magic is not real. My mom was on welfare / food stamps and such. My dad left by the time I was like 2 years old 
40,There are more quality programs than you can imagine. (Recalls). But as far as what's new and coming they never shared any of that stuff with retail but u get asked that 100 + times a day and everyone seems to think that we are all in on it. Also secretly we hate old people and anyone who can't remember their damn passwords ......
41,"I have quite a few other rare conditions as well!!! My sister has murcs which is a form of mrkh but she has a functional uterus and cervix!! She has only 1 kidney and slight scoliosis as well as hearing issues too.
"
42,"Yeahhhhh, i dont think you understood what that comment was saying"
43,Fake it till you make it. Good work!
44,"Can I get uuuuuhhhhhhhh....
two number nines, a number nine large, a number six extra dip, a number seven, two number forty-fives, one with cheese, and a large soda?"
45,"""Heyy is there anything about this story at all that would make any rational human believe this happened and isn't just the deranged sex fantasy of a pathological liar?""

""I don't understand the question lol pregnancy brain!""


When in doubt, pregnancy brain.

Pregnancy brain.

Pregnancy brain."
46,That review is **fascinating**.
47,But... you said he died months later in hospital? lol
48,Well to be fair u avoid those people like the plague and hopefully let one of your coworkers pick that up lol. But as a sign of apology u might offer up to buy that person lunch and laugh about it later and yes we make fun of everyone in the back. It's honestly the only way to remain sane when u get people barking orders at you like it's the end of the world because Netflix won't update. 
49,"No, I continued to live with my family (which is just my mom and my sister). They are still Scientologists. They still give all their money to the church even though they live in poverty. It's frustrating, especially when I had to pay for college, and we just don't talk about Scientology because they know how I feel. I've tried to explain my viewpoint but they never listened. I'm the black sheep of a family when for any other low-income family I'd be the goddamn golden child lol"
50,"I'm sorry that you're so isolated. It's not a good feeling. I wish I had useful advice for you, but I never felt anxious around normal people. At first, it was from a cringey lack of self awareness because when I was 14 I thought I was basically the smartest kid in the world and therefore better than other people. After I grew out of that, I felt no anxiety because I refused to think about what had happened, or even the way my family currently was at home. I pretended I WAS normal. I acted normal and refused to speak or even think about any of this, for years. The first time I ever told someone was when I was 19, and to this day even my close friends don't know. I didn't even write about it in my college essay. I don't know if that's healthy, but it worked and I fit in very well."
51,It helps determine if this is true or not. Something like that would usually make the news.
52,M-m-m-m-monster kill!
53,"It's sad, but here in Australia, that sentiment is embedded in every domestic violence/family violence organisation and media debate. Even front-line mental health services refused to treat me as a DV ""victim"" (I really hate that label), which led to inadequate mental healthcare and put me at significant risk of suicide."
54,I have no clue honestly!! 
55,"thank you, but I'm a pretty terrible person haha. I tend to carry around a lot of residual bitterness because of some of the consequences from all this, aaaaannnd so sometimes I'm just not nice"
56,I'm able to orgasm via clitoral stimulation but ive never had an orgasm just from penetration alone! I hear that's fairly common tho not just an mrkh thing! 
57,"If he was found in a creepy rape dungeon where you ""killed"" him, there would be an investigation that would be reported in the news about a potential abductor being attacked. If he was found with his head stoved in sitting on the couch in his living room, there would STILL be a news story and investigation about a seemingly motiveless murder attempt.

No matter where or how you did the deed, if he was found alive but in critical condition there WOULD be an investigation and news report. There is literally NO WAY for him to have been seemingly killed by you and found alive later without there being both of those pieces of corroborating evidence.

You should have thought through that part a bit more when you were making all of this up."

59,"Did you cut out cheese completely, or just dedicate a specific cheese day of the week?"
60,Nope 😊 everything on the outside looks normal! I dilated (im not sure on spelling for that) naturally shortly after I found out but before that I only had an inch or two of vaginal canal. Now I can have sex normally but when nothing's inserted inside of me my canal basically disappears! This is the oddest reference but have you ever seen those collapsible water bowls?? That's basically what my vaginal canal is like!

71,"Ohhh you win favorite question so far!!! This is shocking because I am an extreme lover of all things puns buttt i dont think i have any for mrkh!!!!

 I'd like to say that mentally I'm in a great place with mrkh and i might have even believed myself until yesterday, but i know I'm not as well off as I'd like to be. I was in the hospital getting another scope to try and figure out my stomach issues and my mum and twin sister came with. Mum was trying to comfort me after i started crying a bit thinking about how they probably didn't find anything new and i was going to be sick forever! She was talking about my upcoming appointments at the Cleveland clinic and how fantastic they are there! She said something along the lines of ""wasn't it the Cleveland clinic who performed the first uterus transplant in the US??"" And im sure my emotions were in overdrive because of the drugs but my heart absolutely broke. I mean I actually felt like my heart was physically breaking and i couldn't even breathe. It felt like the first time I was told I had mrkh but world's worse.  I started crying telling her yes it was the Cleveland clinic and how nice they are for doing that!! It just makes me realize how much mrkh still impacts my life all these years later and how much it still hurts sometimes! 


But with that being said I'm officially on a mission to find a good mrkh pun 😂😂 every once in a while a doctor will run through my history and mention that I have no uterus and ive considered acting horribly shocked like i had no idea just to see their reaction 😂😂 "
72,"Similar thing happened to me in NJ I moved maybe 10 miles from my old house. Was quoted $450 to,move everything (didn't need packing, just,moving the heavy stuff in a big truck) well come moving day, they insisted they had to plastic wrap every piece of furniture ($15per piece) which was fine, but I could have done that myself had they mentioned it. They charged me $60 for travel TO me from,NY where they were coming from plus the $22in tolls (none of which was mentioned before) and they refused to move anything fabric (so clothes, pillows) anything not in a 10×12 box,..so I ended up moving 90% of my,stuff and paid over $1200. I wrote a bad review on YELP and they called demanding,i take it down etc. Admiral Van Lines. Terrible"
73,"It was... awful lol. I started in the middle of March of 8th grade. I had no idea what was going on. I didn't know basic things like to put my name on the corner of a paper or what it was that math equations were asking for. I was seen as really weird - my clothes were weird and I had no exposure to movies, TV, and music and shit that other kids liked. They called me Pretty Face, which sounds like a compliment but it was short for Pretty Face, Weird Girl and was basically just a way to subtly be mean without teachers noticing. I didn't tell anyone that my family was Scientologists. I kept to myself. I had no friends. I taught myself everything in school to the best of my ability. I also paid very close attention to what other kids did socially and made some conscious changes to my personality, so by the time I entered 9th grade I had a pretty well-constructed veneer of normalcy"

75,"BAWLS energy drinks. We supply the region with BAWLS. Ordering in bulk and reselling to multiple similar stores (video game, card, and table top shops).

Console repairs. No PC shop will touch them so best buy and most of the local game stops send the customers to me. A simple repair may cost $45 for 20 mins work. A complex repair may be $100-$150 for several hours work. I sub some of the board level and smaller soldering jobs out at an excellent price due to the volume we do here.

Retro game sales. Collectors will spend $500-$3000 on games that are hard to find. We have collectors that spend that much regularly.

I also have local contacts that will do any type of vinyl decals or 3D printing that we ask for at a reasonable price. So we offer a lot of different cool items and nerd related things that other places don't."

Your attempts at fisking out my comment only cement it harder,  adding to the fact that your adding information you can't know and you dodged the *major* question at every turn, which was how you kept everyone quiet.  Let alone other smaller questions like your ridiculous ""lol"" attempt at explaining why this kid had a love dungeon no one knew about yet was paid for.

You don't know how police work, you don't know how hospital reporting works, you don't know how the press works, and these are all things that would have helped you come up with a better story.   "
85,"I have never and I have never worked with anyone that has to my knowledge. I have been known to charge what became known as an idiot tax. A customer asked for a big mac, I asked meal or on its own. He then looked and me and very slowly said big mac, obviously assuming i didn't understand basic English. I pressed big mac, he then asked for a drink and fries, rather than the meal I entered each item individually, costing him about a pound extra. He didn't noticed the difference and left with the smug face of a man believing he'd proved himself the smarter in the conversation. The food was perfectly edible though."
86,"We clean daily, wipe down everything with lysol and bleach wipes.

We sell retro and used games.

Rowdy people have to be dealt with swifty don't want to spook the regulars or parents.

Equipment wares out no problem, broken on accident little problem, broken on purpose needs to be paid for before they return. 

$3-$4 per hour per person and there are cyber cafe programs that manage it all."
87,"*How do you keep the place clean? Your clientele is not know for hygiene and sitting in a leather chair for hours... 
*How about rowdy customers? Broken equipment? 
*Average cost of setting up? 
*Insurances?
*You also sell games?
*Entry price per time played or per game or how is it handled?"
88,I would reply but evidently I'm not answering any questions 😉
89,"Yeah, the way Google aggregates them is not helpful in this regard. An aggregate 4 star is like...hmm pretty cool I guess. Too bad it's made up of real 1 star reviews and fake 5 star reviews lol."
90,"I wouldn't quite say unexpected, but suprising, possibly.  I figured they would at least pay for the flight out there, or the hotel... but nope -_-"
91,"OR BETTER YET, POST REAL COMMENTS. Theres too many HOLES in your story, so yeah, let's go at it bish.  
  
All of your comments go back and forth, one says you were 22, then 23, now you're 24, all within the same ordeal. This whole timeline starts off at 22, you had a ""big break at college"" then 3 months later...  How can you start the ordeal at 22, and be 6 months pregnant, and 24 now, when the whole situation only could have taken placed 7 months back.  
So lets do this, she's 22, now. starting college? break?  
So, lets start with 22, you are now, 22 years old as you have stated.

3 months later? i'm guessing the whole situation happened with the ""kidnapping""

The Sex dungeon lasted ""30 days"" before you ""escaped.?

You escaped, but injured him, requiring him to get a transplant, (LOL and skip the whole waiting list that was there prior)Thereafter he was in the hospital for 2 months, then died after medical procedures.

So Obviously you're six months Pregnant, lets rewind the time back. So you stated that he died four months back...

Combo Sauce: http://imgur.com/GcKURhM
  
Which makes the time line BROKEN, as how can he die 4-5 Months ago? because he lived for 2 months after you critically ""injured him"" all while you're 6 months pregnant? if you were 8 months pregnant, sure it would be more believable but, simple math does not LIE.  
  
But let's dig deeper into this thing, because fuck you bitch, people get raped and shit all the time and you claim this happened to you and shit, you don't know the impact of this shit. and yet you try to brush it off as if you did go through such an event to make a shitty book, or worse make people care about you, we don't, we care about compassion for the unspeakable act people have been put through because they themselves would not want to be go through that, that part I understand, but for you to come in here and straight up lie, fuck you to the deepest level of your grave.  
  
You say you were from chicago, then say that you aren't, then say that you're a ""WHITE FOSTER KID"" from Ugunda...?  
Then say you're not in the USA, so that narrows you down quite a bit actually.

So let's look at the LIST of legal same sex marriage countries because obviously : http://imgur.com/Eq8SKi4  
Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Mexico,[nb 1] the Netherlands,[nb 2] New Zealand,[nb 3] Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom,[nb 4] the United States[nb 5] and Uruguay. Same-sex marriage is likely to soon become legal in Taiwan, after a constitutional court ruling in May 2017.[1] Furthermore, legislation allowing same-sex marriage in Germany passed the Bundestag on 30 June 2017 and is expected to go into effect in late 2017.[2] Polls show rising support for legally recognizing same-sex marriage in the Americas, Australia and most of Europe.[3][4][5] However, as of 2017, South Africa is the only African country where same-sex marriage is recognized. Taiwan would become the first country in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage if the Civil Code is amended. Israel and Armenia recognise same-sex marriages performed overseas for some purposes.[6][7]

You stated some hateful stuff about your countrie's disdain towards America.

Obviously there are a lot of countries that would be considered hostile to America in some ways, may it be culture, or past wars, or present issues.  
Supposedly you're in one of these countries then.

98,"So your family was very close and yet didn't report you as missing when you were captured for 30 days? I can *maybe* believe you saying that some of the other parts of this didn't make the news for whatever reason, but people don't go missing for 30 days and not make the news. That just doesn't happen."
99,And by the way good luck with collage. I hope the pictures stick to the construction paper.
100,"If you were writing a book on it, why don't you have concrete answers to the most basic questions? This is YOUR STORY (supposedly). You should be able to answer the most basic of questions like ""why didn't the cops investigate any of this?"""
101,There is really a ton of different things but the number one thing that worked for me is educating myself about the science behind fat gain and fat loss. Read up on insulin and its effects based on what you eat. I would recommend the slow carb diet from tim ferris to start and then switch to a keto diet once youre completely used to the slow carb diet. Nutrition is enough to lose fat and stay healthy but exercise helps a lot too. Exercise ONLY works for fat loss if you are eating a clean diet. Educate yourself. I know I already said it but its so important im gonna say it again. Every time you fall off the wagon (because you will) remember that its ok as long as you get bak on the wagon tomorrow or on monday.
102,The only way to know his name is by being able to read the covers of his books. It's not your fault that falls outside of your skillset.

105,So you have no proof and you are parroting the same bullshit unrealistic excuses as before. Your grammar is so laughably bad that you're clearly not a college student. Even college kids know how to use sixth grade English. You talk about moving to the big city but you don't give a name for the city. You don't give any information that any real person would be able to provide. It's not a security or a privacy concern because there are literally tens of millions of Americans living in big cities. You are either a liar or a space alien. I'm hoping you're an alien. Quit your bullshit. Put up or shut up. It's fucking pathetic.

109,My dad is black and not Wiccan and wanted to name me Cinnamon. But my white Wiccan mom wanted to name me Misty Summer Dawn. I ended up with a made-up but fairy normal sounding name.

111,"Ultimately, you love the person. It's sick, and it's twisted, but you can forgive a lot when you're in love. There's other stuff though, for example, I was an extremely confident, self-assured man before I met her, but she completely eroded my sense of self. 

So, the thing people don't often realise, is that when you're in an abusive relationship, your self-esteem is often tied-up in or dependant on the person who has taken it away, so while my ex-partner could make me feel bad about myself, she was also the only one who could validate my self-worth too. So there's that, being in love, and the old trope of promises that things will get better. "

I've been estranged from my mother on and off since I was about 14 but I haven't spoken to her in about 2 and a half years. I don't really plan on seeing her til she's on her death bed tbh. Not because of the witch stuff, but because she's a mentally ill narcissist lol but that's a different story I guess. "

119,Swell the battery leave it charged for a loooong time ( pending no liquid damage) swollen batteries are covered for 2 years on phone 3 years for potable computers and even then if a phone has to be replaced for a swollen battery there's a battery price cost adjustment. Or when I doubt call apple care plead your case and see if they will grant an exception code for retail to use
