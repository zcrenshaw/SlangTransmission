0,"What outcome are you hoping for from this confrontation?

Also I'm really sorry"
1,"That she was short lol and looked much cuter than on pictures. She also jumped on me as soon as she saw me and said ""omg, you're real"". Was obvious to me she was genuinely happy to meet me."
2,"I'm not sure. I'm hurt but I have no intention of shouting or playing the blame game. I think I would like an honest and open conversation. Does that happen in these circumstances? 
I guess both our needs/hurts etc will unfold during the conversation, that's hoping it happens!!"
3,"wow that is an amazing question! well done! 

difficult but I'd say fuck my moms body with my girlfriends mind purely because the other way you are still fucking your mom with her knowledge, unless they are unable to speak then I'd go to town on the mrs' body"
4,"Your mom and your girlfriend switch bodies, you have to fuck one of them, which one do you fuck?"
5,I'd say about 17/18 and it got me nowhere as itv didn't interest me. did get an ex to rim me though just because I wanted to see if she would
6,What age were you when you first tried to put something in your butt for sexual gratification?

8,I wouldn't tongue the ass of Stephen Hawking
9,"Didn't think it was possible my stomach could exit through my feet before. You seem to know the feeling?
"
10,"hell yes momma needs to orgasm too....

....wow just made myself shudder"
11,yes! I'd even take a mani/pedi from him too .. oh... you mean cum on my face.. Yeah I'd take that too for 10 million pounds not dollars :P
12,Did you cry?  Because you can if you want to. 
13,Would you mind giving us an update after you confront him? 
14,"I had a mrs of 9 years, I started an affair with a 17 year old girl it was still going strong for a year I managed to keep up the physical side for both women...I then began cheating on both of them with two of the 17 year olds friends... that's when it all started falling apart and led to my downfall"
15,This doesn't sound like a person that I'd take relationship advice from.
16,Will do. 
17,"I was most disgusted with myself when I was about 14, I used to hang around with a group of friends and 1 had a younger sister she was about 5. 

She worshipped me followed me everywhere anyway we were playing army as young lads do and she kept following giving my position away, so I snapped... I screamed at her and pushed her away, she looked at me so hurt and betrayed it crushed me instantly."
18,I've seen two friends go thru this situation.   Do not tell any family or friends about the infidelity until you are certain you want a divorce.   You may forgive him but they will not.  Talk to a therapist or a trusted friend or stranger who will never share this information.  If you stay together you will have to find a way to get past the betrayal and trust him again.  It will not be easy but leave your options open by not sharing this situation until you are ready to take action.  
19,I'm European I have no idea what tater tots are. 
20,How did you get involved with the Klan?  We're you indoctrinated at a young age or did some life event cause you to join?
21,what was on ITV at the time?
22,"I bet there's all types of nasty shit we all WOULD do for one, but what WOULDN'T you do for a Klondike bar?"
23,"first masturbated about 11ish, always stopped when it started to buzz thinking that was it, didnt realise I was edging myself haha so imagine my delight after a year of this when I finally came!

my fetish is outdoors, I love the risk and yes I've been caught.

I tell one lie every single day, and that's that I'm happy, never have been never will be truly."
24,"nah, I have my old best mates sisters undies though, not even because I thought it would turn me on it was more because I knew I shouldn't of done it"
25,"Damn right I did, though that was not the goal lol"
26,"Same happened to me,  married 9 years, 2 children.  We divorced, and after a few years got back together.  It was difficult,  still a work in progress. The shock of my wife having an affair resonated for years, specially the way I found out, it took a lot to forgive and move on.  I'm sorry you're going through this,  it's tough.."
27,So what was your first impression upon meeting her?
28,"Ok, I came here thinking I got this...NVM you sicko's already got it all covered lol üëç"
29,mate I made her shrivel up like a warm Stephen hawking
30,pics or gtfo
31,"Congratulations! Keep positive :) 3 of my nieces/nephews were in the NICU when born - all 3 were very very tiny, born very very early and had various health difficulties. Now they are all in primary school and you wouldn't even be able to tell they'd had such a rocky start. NICU nurses and doctors are truly worth their weight in gold. If you don't mind me asking, have you got a name for your bundle of joy yet? :)"
32,"I'm from Ukraine, she's from the Philippines. "
33,"the weather channel, or maybe a science textbook actually!....Yeah that one wins hands down"
34,We're in fact married now and are living in my country. 
35,Saw this request and decided to make a profile. My fianc√© and I are recently engaged and we initially met on Tinder.
36,I tried mushrooms and felt like I was reborn every ten seconds for the first time in my life I was in a kitchen talking to the fridge which was just a big white blob. Ten seconds later I was talking to it again reintroducing myself. My friends found it hilarious and I had the sensation of spinning around although I was stationary.

38,"This thread, I would think. "
39,"I found a video on our laptop. I couldn't believe it at first then I put all the pieces together..all of my hunches came true. I began to think of all times I had a hmm moment.  I confronted her,  denied everything..but couldnt deny the video. "
40,Hope everything turns out to be fine
41,Nah. He's gonna get it all stinky. 
42,Would you take a facial from donald trump for ten million US dollars?
43,I pledge to donate $1000 in the name of each victim of this heinous act. I will also cover all medical and burial expenses. I can do this because of my vast wealth from the residual checks I received from being the voice of Snake Eyes in G.I. Joe in various animated series.
44,"She is a married therapist, She offers relationship advice, amongst other things. They had a relationship over a decade ago. I have no more details on that it was just referred to in one of their conversations. 
I don't know what he saw in her for, me to know that I will need to know firstly what he felt was lacking, if anything, between us. "
45,lmao I didn't mean to put the V at the end which is hysterical as that's an actual channel for us limeys (I know you are from the UK too but some on here are americanos)
46,10 million pounds of cum is probably a lot. 
47,"No questions, but from an American who is now happily married to and living with a German I met online and spent 4 years in a long distance relationship with, congratulations on your success."
48,"just think how wrinkled and sweaty it is down there though, proper crotch stew going on"
49,"well that just fucking blows

on the bright side, at 20 you will breeze thru therapy.  the PTs won't know how to keep up because you're a hell of a lot younger than what they're used to working with

work like a dog in PT.  make it your 2nd job.  the harder you work in rehab the better the results.

good luck and i'll have and advil or 10 for ya ;-)
"
50,"Wow that's a tough one to answer right now. I don't want it to sound glib by saying a lot depends on how he reacts tonight but I do feel that will tell me a lot about the future. 
Could I forgive him, yes I could, we are all human and we all fuck up now and again and our actions can be lead by our insecurities. 
Will it ever be the same, maybe, after some work. I think all things are possible if two people want the same thing enough. 
I have never had an affair nor have I had to deal with this before. It's all new territory for me."
51,"I followed one of those ones that you find on the likes of LadBible, it just lead to more and more different ads. It's like being on YouTube, you eventually get to the weird side."
52,"I was in the middle of a large crowd when the bomb didn't go off, instantly killing no one.  "
53,My husband 
54,worst lie you got caught in?
55,"More a style of rings:  I learned to make rope out of silver, and then I learned to make flexible bands out of that.  They're very light and cut down on materials, they're super comfortable and you can do literally any design with it.  


http://imgur.com/a/aI9zs This is my favorite example, it was fun doing one that sleek and delicate.  Plus that's a moissanite, they're indestructible almost, I set it with a tire iron."
56,"How did you come to the beliefs you once held? (Family, friends, an event) What made you want to change your previous held beliefs?"
57,That last line got heavy :/
58,"ok well I mostly go on xvideos dot com, and I go on amatuer and search one of the following - 

riding pov
public masturbation
public wanking
exposing on bus
red head pov
emo pov

the videos are refreshed and new daily that's why I love the site"
59,"what happens if you eat LSD or  mushroooms? Do you still ""see"" patterns?"
60,Glad you are ok now :)
61,it was a pic of the anatomy but minus the skin so was showing muscle and tendons
62,"Thank you so much for the encouragement! It's difficult for us to deal with, but we are also surrounded by families who have a much more dire situation than ours, so it helps to keep us in check. 

Her name is Lorelai Jewelene :) "
63,"Don't be a turd, m8."
64,"Homophobia is just baffling to me. You're not a threat to any men. You're not in competition for women. Ignorance and religious intolerance. I'm sorry, dude. 

How do your folks feel?"
65,What is the best temperature for the oven to be on to cook tater tots so they arent mushy?
66,Have you ever sniffed a family members panties?
67,We have been living together for a few years. We both have adult children and neither of us are spring chickens.
68,"Damn I'm sorry. I can't imagine how hard it would be with kids in the mix. If you don't mind me asking how did you find out?
I'm glad you are making it work for you both now. "
69,Bet you made her shudder too...
70,"Are you willing to forgive him? And if yes, do you think things will ever be the same?"
71,"Yeah, we had nothing to do with the scheduled date, but we both thought it was kind of funny. 

I also gave him some ceramic penguins and a chocolate bar.  "
72,"My mom called them and told them that my bmom had infiltrated the school and sent her daughter on a mission to find me without contacting her first.  This is a pretty big breach of trust between bmom and mom.

Basically BMom regretted putting me up for adoption and wanted to be apart of my life.  Mom on the other hand was my parent, and was scared of me being kidnapped or getting confused on who my parents should be.

From the schools perspective, I was in danger.  "
73,"Yep, age confirmed."
74,"The thing is though. That it wasn't that huge of an event in regards to British history. Obviously it had a huge impact on future world events but based on the number of national and international events Britain has seen since history has been recorded in the west, combined with the limited time a student has to study history over their school life, it's not surprising it's barely covered (if at all).

"
75,"Well to explain the story correctly I have to kind of do a backstory on him and us. Me met because we both shared a love for Thrash Metal, he has been to a bunch of Metallica and Megadeth concerts, he even saw the BIG 4 (Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax) in California. He was a super chill dude and we both played guitar. So we started a little band. I know this may seem weird to someone who wasn't around us but he was like 55 and I was like 16 I believe. So he was like a brother, dad, and best friend figure.

With that being said, I was helping him move from his old place to his new place which was only like a few blocks over. He stayed up the whole day and night before drinking out of celebration. Him and I were going to build a small little music studio on his property so we were both ecstatic! He wasn't the type of dude to get drunk or drink just to get all fucked up drunk or anything, he drank when he got excited, and like I said, out of celebration. Well he drank all night long and all day long, and when it finally got time to move, we headed over to the new place and dropped off some stuff, went back and forth a couple times. Well he was still really drunk and me being me, his wife was telling me she doesn't like it when he's this drunk. He wasn't being mean or abusive or anything, just a little goofy but she told me to put his beer somewhere because he would stop drinking. But before I went back off he told me he ""I love you bro! You're welcome here anytime. I don't say that to anyone! You are a great kid and I appreciate everything you have done for my family."" In reply to me telling him some issues I was having with my moms boyfriend at the time. So instead of going back with him and the rest of everyone that was there to eat more stuff from the old place, I stayed behind to place his beer somewhere. Well I watched him take off on the back of an old green truck. A few minutes later me and a family member of my friends wife got a call (we will call my best friend Bob for the rest of this story) ""Bob fell!""

So her and I get in the car to go help Bob off the ground. I have been drunk before and fallen, you know when you're too drunk to get yourself back on your feet, so I was like ""let's go help him get back up"". Well as we drive up to the old place we see like an ambulance and paramedics surrounding something. I got out of the car and heard his wife (we will call her Anna for the rest of this story) screaming ""I want to die! I don't want to live anymore!"" And stuff like that. I was like ""What the fuck is going on?!"" So I looked down and saw Bob laying on the street with blood pouring out of his mouth and what looked like also his ears. He was a light blue color and I was completely in shock. You see movies and think to yourself. ""That shit wouldn't bother me."" But when you see it in person and seriously when you least expect it, it puts you in shock. I asked others what happened and they said they didn't see it but could tell he grabbed his bike and he hit the speed bump by him (that was totally cracked and fucked up and made it very easy for ANYONE to get hurt) and flew over the bike and slammed his head on the ground and never woke up. I didn't say anything to anyone, but by looking at where his body was and where the speedbump was, I could see he did indeed fall and his his head. However I could also see he crawled about 4 yards forward after he hit his head and then died... he was well aware his life was leaving. 

Literally a couple minutes before we were talking, and now I'm looking down at the same person dead just moments later. So they were able to revive him and they put him in the back of the ambulance and took off.

They got him to the hospital, did surgery, surgery went good. He was in the ICU for a few days. They did some tests and found out was brain dead and so we all had to say goodbye. I told him I would take care of his wife and I would continue to peruse our dream. That I would continue to make music for him and carry on what we had. I said I would take care of his wife (since she had medical problems) and that if he could hear me, everything will be okay and that it's okay to let go. I told him not to stress because I will take care of it all so he could feel better in knowing someone was their for his family. A little bit later they pulled his plug and he was dead once again. 

After he died I went into a very deep depression for a long long time. Well over a year. And I failed my promise to take care of his wife. I barely even visited her. Just being in the house with her reminded me too much of everything and me being the emotional pussy I am, I couldn't handle it. I would stop by every now and again, but almost exactly a year after he died, she died in the same hospital room. Being way to young for that, and being the strong man who couldn't cry Infront of his family is what killed me the most emotionally. I couldn't express my feelings so I bottled them up inside. I knew if I cried or showed weakness in front of them, they wouldn't have anything to hold on to. 

The thing that eats me up inside every single day is knowing he would have been alive if I went with him instead of staying back. My job was to put the boxes from outside into the back of the truck, I never went inside the old house because it was too crowded with everyone in there. So I know 100% that if I were there, I would have seen him grab the bike and I would have flat out said ""no, I love you man but lay your ass down."" And he would still be alive today. 

And every time I go outside of my house I am reminded of that day since the speedbump he hit was the one right outside of my house. 

TLDR
My friend was drunk, crashed his bike, slammed his head on the street, bled everywhere, was pronounced dead, however he was revived and brought to the hospital only to find out he was brain dead and we had to pull the plug. 

I have learned to accept what happened but I still wish he was here. 

EDIT: I'm sure I spelled shit wrong but I'm typing this all out on a phone and I haven't slept at all yesterday and last night so my brain is not being the best right now."
76,Get out.
77,"&gt; I know the UK school system is considered quite different, and weird.

As someone who studied in the UK, what is considered to be different or weird? I didn't know there was that perception."
78,Haha yeah it's rapidly getting that way! 
79,"A forensic hospital is a mental hospital for people who often have committed a crime, but are ""incompetent"" to stand trial (unable to go to court) due to their mental state, in which case we treat them to get well enough to go back to court. Or they are not guilty by reason of insanity, in which case they will not go to jail, and treat them to go back to the community eventually. 

Its the people hollywood makes everyone with a mental illness out to be :p"
80,"It's too early to say I think and it depends a lot on what this affair was, I guess. TBH I am not sure. I love him dearly and I suppose the ultimate perfect ending would be for us to work this out but there are so many variables. The level of the lies, his reaction when I talk to him, regaining trust. There is a lot to be considered."
81,"He says he has very minimal pain.  I, on the other hand, feel like I got punched in the abdomen by a silverback gorilla. "
82,"From
My experience at school, we don't "

84,"God, I am sorry. I've been there, and it is hell on earth. This is about eight months in, so it's still fresh. 

All I can say is the magic formula to whether you make it or not from here, depends fully on his level of remorse and willingness to work on himself and make amends and to take the freakin crazy train that he created, because your life is about to become hell for a long time if you try to stay together.

But we are still together, and it's true, it gets easier as time passes. I can think about it now without instant crippling rage, and that's progress. If you ever need to talk to someone who understands, please pm me. I am so willing to help. I'd love to think my experience had some good in it, even if just making me now equipt to help someone else through this hell."
