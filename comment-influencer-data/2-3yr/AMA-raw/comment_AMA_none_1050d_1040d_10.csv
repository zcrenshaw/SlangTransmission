0,At this one only women can initiate. Which I think makes it feel much less creepy. 
1,PM me
2,You didn't respond to my text. 
3,Are you okay with wasting a delicious acid trip typing in answers to questions on a tiny little rectangle you fit in your pocket?
4,Drinks. Get to know people. Awkward conversations where you don't want to reveal too much. Eventually a fair amount of sex. 
5,"1. Google pretty much. Though I also live in NY and they are mentioned a lot in nightlife circles. 
2. A dark angel, and a light angel in terms of costumes. "
6,Are you rigging the election for Donald Trump?
7,Jesus you're right
8,Even my granddad does
9,"Didn't happen to me but two people recognized each other and were friends and certainly did not expect to see each other there. 
The strangest thing to me was having to find the bits and pieces of clothing and costume as we were trying to leave and having to navigate through a sea of sex acts for the lost sock and pants.  "
10,"I've just thought of a few questions 
1. How do you find out about these sex parties 
2. Who did you fuck? (Character wise) "
11,Quite awkward but one does not say 'let's try a sex party' without being open to it. But still. Some quite odd moments. 
12,Imagine being that guy who can't even get laid at a sex party. 
13,I fucked 2. Had my cock sucked by 4 and went down on 3. And most of it happened all around others doing the same. 
14,How do I know that you are telling the truth?
15,"Do you believe your current mental status to be nature, nurture or both?"
16,The noise. The kids would never fucking shut up. 
17,Like my face but a reflection of it.
18,The stereotype comes from the multitude of russian dashcam videos. 
19,Handy
20,The kid that bullied me decided it would be a fun idea to stand next to me the entire ride and scream in my ear. It was honestly beginning to ache that I seriously considered opening the door and pushing him out of the moving bus. 
21,Username checks out. 
22,What happens at said Sex Party?
23,Not one. But there was a theme hence all the angels and priests. 
24,"Actually yes. It's not a gangbang, if the women are in control of what they are ok with it makes it much easier and more fun. "
25,I edged up a few times but had told my girl that I would finish with her so that was when we got home. It took a lot of will power. 
26,Easy 
27,"No, it's infinite."
28,How do you initiate sex at a sex party? 
29,I think there is a fair amount of supplement taking for that. I did notice a bunch of guys masturbating to try and get it up. 
30,I got hummus
31,There were a few who stayed on the sidelines. I assumed either they liked to watch or the woman who came with them was not someone they had sec with. 
32,So basically you fucked the [Change of Heart Yugioh card](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/yugioh/images/2/21/ChangeofHeart-LCYW-EN-ScR-1E.png)?
33,That's rude
34,Go outside ! Put this object down and look at nature and shit! Say goodbye to all these fucks! We're done here!
35,My husband and I once posted an ad looking to bring in another male into our bedroom and I received an email in reply to this ad from someone we both knew who did volunteer ESL teaching with us and his wife was our daughter's 2nd grade teacher. I replied letting him down and revealing our identities saying if he wanted to chat about kink he's more than welcome and he came over and talked to my husband and I and tried to feel me up and apparently keeps it from his wife which for us we weren't ok with and didn't want any part of... so it was weird. We were invited to several cook outs and we just don't see each other any more. It was weird.
36,"The biggest for me is that some people automatically assume that EVERYBODY with these traits are violent/aggressive automatically because they have it. Yes it mostly MAY be the case but I operate pretty well in everyday life as I'm sure others do, we aren't all lunatics waiting for a chance to strike"
37,So did you see any guys being left out?
38,It's is only couples or couples +1 girl. So quite good. 
39,"You can have the cake, just no icing. "
40,The 2 I had sex with were solid 8s. The other 2 BJ girls were a 6 and a 7. I also went down on a delightful 9. 
41,That's pretty cool 
42,Because eventually the burden of lying becomes too much for one's shoulders. This is taking weight off.
43,No question. Just wanna say you're a total badass!
44,What's the funniest/strangest thing that happened to you?
45,Checkmate Republicans
46,Why was I not invited?
47,Hard to say that trickle down econ would help..historically it hasnt
48,"It was more my friends than myself, I got used to it and often just brushed it off as everybody is like this (early teens) and as the years went by it turned into close friends brushing what I said off as ""You weird fucker haha"" to being sat down by a couple of friends and getting told that something isn't right and they're concerned by the way I act and things I'll say etc and that I should seek medical attention.

I just brushed it off as ""whatever, I'm ok"" but the years went by up until my early twenties when I was losing quite a few people around me from my ""behaviour"" and just lack of empathy or showing emotion (to this day even with my girlfriend just to try and make things normal I have to ""simulate"" certain emotions, sayings and things etc)

I've lost countless girlfriends and family members/friends due to being ""cold, emotionless and just odd"" or things I've done, it's not the getting caught that bothers me at all. I couldn't care less about that. It's purely the doing it that really gets me going.

When these comments started getting more frequent and the loss of people around me I decided to seek professional opinions which led to my diagnosis.

Just a little info to clarify for the girlfriend thing - I'm not evil in any way to her, it's just the normal relationship type things I see from other couples isn't there, I have to emulate being happy and enjoying something with her, it just feels like the emotion state for things like this aren't ""active"" within me.

It has darker depths too, often while I could be out on a ""date night"" with her, eating food going for drinks etc I'll often be thinking about recent murder videos I've seen, gore videos, anything dark and death related seems to make me ""perky"" to the point where she thinks I'm really enjoying my time with her, in actual fact it's the thought and memories alone of things like that which somewhat lift me and perk me in situations like this so I have to use that method just to emulate what happiness seems like with other people in restaurants/bars etc "
49,Did any of the women fart?
50,How good are you at CSGO
51,Outside is awesome
52,"Squatting is for gopniks, and we don't have many gopniks now. I'm a boy. None of crocs"
53,"- I feel like Canadians are proud to be known as polite and helpful people and embrace the stereotype wholeheartedly, because I see a lot of people giving it forward here. There's assholes everywhere, but being an asshole is seen as Un-Canadian, and I think that's awesome 
- It's super diverse and everyone gets along well for the most part, which allows for a lot of cultural exchange. Overall, the social climate is a lot kinder to immigrants than in the states in my opinion
- I get provincial healthcare through my university, so almost everything is free. I was hospitalized for a kidney infection earlier this year that would have cost me thousands in the states (even with private insurance), and it was completely free. Medications are also super cheap up here, even if you're uninsured
- I can afford to go to university here without taking out private student loans!!
- Everyone around me is as horrified by the American political circus as I am and offer their condolences often 
- TAP. I can't believe this isn't in the states. You can pay for things by tapping your card on the machine.
- Drake"
54,Yes sir
55,Stop
56,I suck at it
57,"People who did so will be in jail for involuntary manslaughter, or just dead."

59,Absolute necessity (–Ω–µ—Ç)
60,Do you have a dashcam?
61,I did sort of a phantom of the opera meets priest. 
62,That picture is literally in every cabinet and office. I can explain that if you wish
63,The best thing is how nice and great people **can** be and the worst for me is how bad technology is in Russia. Also how people sometime behave and think narrow
