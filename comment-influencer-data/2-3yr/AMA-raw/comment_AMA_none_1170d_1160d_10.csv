1,OP's Moms
2,Because I'm an idiot
3,We are going to see this post again from a different user in a year except instead of Brexit it will say Donald Trump. 
4,I'll start: why did you miss your flight?
5,How do you feel about Child Molestation?
6,"When you high five people, do you use both hands?"

8,"I had a pair made for myself

9,"In other words, let's find an idiot we can lash out on.

Somehow I think you won't find anyone."
10,"OP must have forgotten about this post.

edit: ""Half the time I forget to even do my homework.""  Now I feel bad for this post.  OP, pls forgive."
11,"Pretty good, schools off now so thats great."
12,was Daddy a Diplomat?
13,"Yes! lol, I do that most of the time with my friends. "
14,*Tea
15,I find your shirt very appropriate for this comment reply
16,"As excellent as my math skills might be, no. I just found another way to count with my fingers than my peers did. It's easy for me to multiply in three's. "
17,"No...let's just say my right-hand looks like a vagina when it's closed. But I generally use my left hand, it's not difficult. "
18,"I'm really sorry that you're such a piss baby you can't even handle a conversation about a prevalent social issue without trying to pathetically defend your fragile privilege.

EDIT: the fact that you downvoted this response is only further proof of your extraordinary maturity."
19,"A guy at work was claiming to be a Leave supporter until he got to the ballot box. He voted Remain because he has an apartment in Greece and realised that by voting Leave he would be shooting himself in the foot. 

Now he's annoyed that we are Leaving. "
20,"don't fuck this up

you got a life you are partially responsible for now.  so you gotta go be the kind of person you want your child to be.  parenting isn't exactly hard - you just gotta constantly show the kid what you want them to become.  and they're watching.  all the time.  they've got built in bullshit detectors as well - so if you say one thing and do something else they're gonna call you on it or at least make note

good luck"
21,Ill just leave this here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuru_(disease)
22,"You should post this to /r/Brasil. But anyway, I'm from SÃ£o Paulo which is the next state over. Crime is absolutely rife. Pickpockets, kidnappers, thieves, you name it, on a daily basis. Brazilians are notorious for their complete lack of organisation, so you bet this is going to be either a total disaster or they're going to somehow pull it out of the bag at the very last second. "
23,"How does fingering a chick work for you? I don't mean to be rude, I just mean your hands have such a unique shape and size that they're more like a dick than most dudes' hands, but unlike a dick you can manipulate them once they're all up in there.

I guess my question is: you look like you'd be rad at twiddling twat. Confirm/Deny?"
24,"I just read an article today - the police are in the airports protesting because they haven't recieved a paycheck in a couple months. They are holding signs saying' welcome to hell', lol That is the reason they are saying they cannot protect the tourists/citizens. I am certain they will work out the logistics of their pay by August.

I also heard about the super bacteria strains in in the water on the beach shorelines resistant to our current treatments of antibiotics.

"
25,still is one
26,"Do all of her selves love you?  What happrns when one of the other hers wakes up in the middle of the night and sees you?  Does it feel like cheating to be intimate with the other hers?  Is the her that you are in love with her dominant personality, or just one of her manifestations?  Hows the sex?"
27,"I voted Remain, but my Brother voted Out, and now sorely regrets it. I don't think he ever really thought it would happen to be honest. "
28,IDK who the fuck thought it was a good idea to host the olympics there to begin with.
29,i don't care what the answer is but it is Ask Me *Anything*
30,My brother accidentally grated a huge chunk out of his finger with the cheese grater and it landed in the pile of cheese. I had no idea and grabbed a handful and ate it. The skin was chewy and tasted a bit like a hard tofu cube. 0/10. Do not recommend.
31,"They always say ""multiple witnesses"" no matter what."
32,"Like this?

33,"Talk to police first, and if you don't get an apology, chat with the media. Mom on chemo held at gunpoint. They'll be all over that."
34,"Hey brother, I'm a combat veteran as well. Served with the Australian Army (6RAR 43B) in Afghanistan in 2010. I lost mates from IED attacks and firefights. I lost more mates to PTSD when we came home. I know the struggle you're going through mate and I honestly hope things get better for you! If you ever need to talk my man just give me a PM. 

I was never deployed to Iraq, closest I got was Kuwait. My question to you is did you believe that Iraq was justified and how did you feel about participating in this conflict?
"
35,"I think 75% of people who voted leave thought this too. But it's stupid to vote leave because ""you didn't think it would happen"", it's like saying I punched myself in the face because I didn't think it would hurt."
36,Nope. I only got amnesia after we had a few drinks.
37,"&gt; If the olympics were to be held in the US, you could say a lot of negative things about the major cities that would be hosting events.

Maybe, but could you say that roads and bike paths are collapsing resulting in deaths, or that human remains are randomly being discovered in the Olympics area, or that mascots are being murdered, or that the police are on strike and crime rates are through the roof, or that the water is toxic?

I think it's good to question the media's narrative, but this doesn't seem like an exaggeration and the problems being reported certainly aren't like what any other Olympics has faced."
38,You can and should blame them personally.
39,...What?
40,Great ama

42,Do you know Carmen San Diego? 
43,I make the excuse that my twin brother bit my fingers off while my mom was pregnant lol.
44,No use crying over spilt milk....
45,"Once a guy was buying a lot of male enhancement pills. What we sell is the real deal. Not what you find in a gas station. But he was asking questions along the lines of if he put it in a drink, could someone else taste it. And he brought to the counter some pretty heavy duty rope and other bondage stuff. But the questions about the pills were really off putting. 

We didn't sell him anything and my manager told him not to come back.

Edit: I can't type today"
46,"Mom isn't doing too good. This is happening right before her next session of chemo, too. She is understandably pissed.

The cops did not admit any fault besides saying ""all clear"". 

Although we weren't handcuffed, they did say at one point they ""you know we could've handcuffed your hands and feet and taken you.""

All this based on false witness testimony of course.

Personally, I think the cops should be ashamed of themselves today. I can't blame them personally because they're just doing their job, but to have men with guns violate the privacy of our home really disturbs us. We're thinking about going to the police station and politely asking for an apology."
47,"Haha thanks. But yeah, unfortunately I've never tried that before."
48,"Fuck dude, I was born with 10 fingers and 4 thumbs, had the thumbs removed when I was 1 though you should have had my spare thumbs "
