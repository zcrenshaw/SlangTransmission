0,I don't think this story is that unusual..... The key here is you didn't land a 97k job you worked up to it. Not saying it isn't an achievement but you're clearly not stupid so if you show some capabilities within a role moving up is kind of what happens. Once your foot is on the door the hard part is done imo. 
1,"&gt; because a man orgasming became related to a feeling of safety (because it meant the current rape was over)


holy shit this is so brutally fucked up on so many levels

you have my empathy"
2,"I was under the same threats for minor things like grades as for larger things like telling about the abuse. So, despite later being diagnosed with dyslexia, my grades were actually pretty good.

&amp;nasp;

I have had sexual relationships since. I've been avoiding men for the last couple of years since a boyfriend abused me (again) but when I was with decent people, I liked sex. I got triggered sometimes and despite my enthusiasm for sex, my partner would often have to deal while I cried or relived things, sometimes even to the point where I was confused about where I was. However, I think largely because I came to associate sexual attention as the only attention I was worthy of and because a man orgasming became related to a feeling of safety (because it meant the current rape was over) I've always enjoyed sex and pursued it within my relationships. "
3,"I did. My sister genuinely tried to get me to strip naked and kill them with an ax when she was 16 and had just read about Lizzy Borden. At first I jokingly agreed but changed my mind when I saw she was serious. I've had a couple of men I dated offer to kill them but I always loved them to much to let them risk their safety. Once, when I was very near suicide I got a boyfriend to borrow a family member's gun and show me how to use it. After a very tough personal struggle I opted to stay alive, but if I had killed myself I would have gone to my parents house and shot them first. Good news though, they got caught (not for the sex trafficking but for trafficking drugs into a foreign country) and are in jail for up to 14 years now."
4,"How did it affect your school life? Assuming you actually attended of course

Also have you had any sexual relations since? If so how has your experience affected that? 

Also just wanted to day I'm very sorry for what happened to you"
5,Yeah that's true. I feel like a lot of people out there without any formal education would be great employees. Sucks that some people won't even talk to you until you have a piece of paper. 
6,"Maybe it's because the majority of drop outs are not like you. A degree shows one main thing (besides teaching you specific skills), in my opinion, aptitude for carrying a long term project to an end and ability to work at a certain level. So for an employer I think it's just more time efficient to require a degree rather than interviewing all the potential dropouts to ""give them a chance."""

8,"Yeah it actually has come to bother me greatly when people use ""triggered"" jokingly or lightly. It's the *only* word I have to explain a vivid flashback that breaks me down to my knees or a huge bottle of alcohol needed to deaden the memories and keep me from screaming and frightening the neighbors.... It's not a joke. 

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you for being a caring teacher. I wish I'd come across more like you."

10,"I did call some places who deal with sex trafficking for resources but there's very little in my area. My sister is 6 years older than me and I know her background was traumatic but she very seriously molested me when she was 11-14 and I was 5-8. Also she is a deeply unstable person who ridicules me for my depression and other issues, mistreats her children and everyone around her and will outright claim no abuse happened to either of us a large portion of the time, which is hurtful and confusing. Basically, she let our background turn her into a terrible, toxic person. We almost never speak now. "
11,"ITT: OP uses the word triggered and its legit!

OP: I'm a teacher and the kind of stuff that happened to you breaks my heart. Protecting you guys is part of why I got into the profession."
12,Go to see them in jail. Talk out loud about how they are pedophiles and sexually molested you and sold you off for child prostitution. They won't live 14 years in jail.
13,[deleted]
14,"Almost anything. Housekeepers don't really report lost towels and things like that. Especially if you ball them up and throw them on the floor. Shampoos, soaps, toothpaste, and things like that are pretty much fair game. Just don't steal the TV or furniture and you're probably safe. And don't break things. "
15,"Did you ever consider revenge? i mean in the sense either kill some of those fucking bastards, or get them killed."
16,Welcome to my life lol. Thank you.
17,"How did you finally manage to get away? 
"
18,[deleted]
19,What are you gonna do with the other 6 lives you got left?
20,"Hmmm, I've found all kinds of things from adult toys to loaded guns. But I guess the strangest thing I found was what appeared to be a few attempts at a suicide note. There was a few crumpled up pieces of paper around the room all of which seemed to be a last letter to a loved one. The guy checked out and have no idea what happened after that, but it's always stayed in my mind. "
21,that is really nice of you .. but the only thing that I want is for the rest of the world to understand what is happening here and why it is happening to understand that Assad is a war criminal and that his regime can't rule syria after all what happened ... you could do me and the rest of the Syrian people a great favour by spreading awareness about this and help fighting the false propaganda that depict all rebels as terrorists.. thank you very much for your concern and for your gesture.
22,[deleted]
23,"I went to a number of therapists, but I've found each one ill-equipped to deal with my level of trauma. So ill-equipped (and in many cases so inept) that they actually damaged me further rather than helping. I've since given up on therapy as an option for me. 

&amp;nbsp;

I coped with it by compartmentalizing. I would literally have had no idea if you'd asked me about being prostituted when I was at school or church. Likewise I think I wouldn't have been able to recall school when men came to our house or I was in a brothel (I worked in two). It took a few months for me to start facing the memories once I left home and a few years before I could fully admit to myself or anyone else what all actually happened to me. Thank you very much for your support."
24,"My parents were drug addicts my entire life. In my youth I saw and experienced things that heavily traumatized me, I've never gone to a psychiatrist or anything like that but many people have told me I exhibit symptoms of ptsd from the things that happened to me and around me while I was with my parents. 
 
Ive spent a lot of time around drug dealers, criminals, people of the kind, and it was hard for me to not be that type of person. I never became a drug addict like them but I did smoke a lot of weed and did my fair share of adderol (they were heroin addicts for reference) I was their only child and they needed to keep custody of me so they could have the medical card to get drugs, otherwise I probably would've lived with other family long ago. 

Many details to it all but they basically kicked me out of their house cause they didn't like my girlfriend. They did it for a power trip, just to make me fall in line, but I was disgusted with them after everything I'd done for them throughout my life, just for them to put me on the streets for something like that. I never turned back, me and my father saw each other many times afterward, we fought, argued, made spites, but in the end we stopped seeing each other. I haven't seen my mother since the day they kicked me out. (This is by choice as my mother was always the worst of the two, I ve always considered my father her victim, but that's a story for another time.) 

I was done at first, didn't give a shit and was planning on robbing a local site or something ridiculous like that. My best friends family ended up taking me in some months later. They cared for me like I was one of their own and helped me finish highschoool/become independent. I would probably be in prison if they never cared

I'm not in touch with any of them anymore, specifically the ones that keep in touch with my folks. It's sad but I really can't risk the chance to have them back in my life, knowing things about me, where I live, who my gf is and the like. They're spiteful people, who would definitely jump at a chance to get back at me. 

There is, however, some really extended family, who don't really even know my folks, that I see every now and then, so i guess I see some of them here and there but it's just like we're old friends"
25,"I'm female, so have included that.

I'm fine with her lifestyle, but a lot of times I don't like the people. Some of them are great people and I like spending time with. But many others are just awful. She got into a relationship with an alcoholic. He'd run around the property in nothing but a collar with a tag that said ""Lucky Boy"". Which would be fine but he 'patrols' the property. One time he got super aggressive with some hikers that got turned around, yelling at them is was private property. All completely naked of course. He got the cops called on us for that one. Another one would belittle me a lot, saying that people my age need it. 

I suppose I tend to be embarrassed when a new friend meets her. She isn't great at putting a filter on. When I was maybe 12 or 13 she took me and some of my school friends to some nude springs. Not really BDSM related but it really pissed off my friend's parents. Another time she went off talking about how to properly use a dildo when me and a friend was chatting. 

I actually look back on this memory with much fondness, but she has a large black 'X' shaped cross that is used strap people to it. It looks like this [NSFW picture](http://x.imagefapusercontent.com/u/langer77/3407510/125723716/angel_lee_web_4_DSCF0042.jpg). Anyway, shortly after I started bringing my boyfriend around she was renovating her sex dungeon and needed to move it back in. But it was heavy and since my boyfriend was the only guy around at the time, she asked him to do the gentlemanly thing. So he heaved that thoroughly used sex cross onto his back and carried it across the house. So of course we make many jokes about his bearing that cross and carrying it like Jesus. He really is a trooper.

&gt;Do you have a close relationship with her?

I use to have a super close relationship to her. But a few years ago her mother (my grandmother) died and it kinda fucked up our family. I try to visit her regularly, but she is much more reclusive and angry when I talk to her. I'm not positive, but considering that I've found some meth and meth pipes around upon occasion, I think she is getting into meth. None of that is BDSM related, but this is all to say our relationship is strained. And now I'm kinda bummed out thinking about it.
"
26,"Hey, great question. I first looked at my ""saved"" post section, but I had not regularly used that function until the last 3 years.  

I checked out the top posts of all time on r/all and realized that I have missed out on some of the most popular posts of all time because of my strict subreddit diet.

It hit me though. It was the night of the 2012 Aurora theater shooting. I was incredibly worried that someone I knew personally might have been affected, and felt sick about all of those innocent people being maimed or killed.  Someone who was in the theater started posting pictures of his bullet wounds from the ER, and gave a moment by moment description of his experience.  It personalized something that was barely conceivable. I didn't turn on the news or go to CNN or anything, because this guy had just put it all out there, primary source style.

That was probably the most important post."
27,"Copy pasta from a reply in the other thread I was in. 

As for weirdest guest, working midnight to 8am you see a lot (I'm in a resort town that's heavy on bars). However, there's this one lady who stayed with us a few times that brought like 10 large sized stuffed dolls with her. She would wheel them around in this cart and have full blown conversations with them. She would have them talk to us at the front desk and basically treat them as if they were real people. Over the years I've encountered a lot of people that were a little off, but I think she takes the cake. "
28,"My father was a deacon. And briefly a pastor, actually. I believe he's still registered as a minister with the Assemblies of God unless it requires some kind of annual renewal. And in one particular church, my sister tried to tell the youth pastor and both he and the pastor became involved in raping us. Actually I think church was a perfect place for them to hide out. It gives the veneer of being ""good"" and fitting in and it affords the praise that psychopaths and narcissists crave in response to their bragging. We spent a *lot* of time in church during some periods and my parents were actually hardcore fundamentalists in the Assemblies of God.

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately I'm not near DC, but I really appreciate the offer, thank you. "
29,Might be a good idea to have some proof on this one...
30,Any proof that you are who you say you are? For all we know you're some rando spreading even more misinformation.
31,"I'm pretty sure everyone has someone else shoot them up for their first time, I had a friend do it for me. And yes I know exactly what you mean, there are two types of heroin addicts in my experience. The ones who will feel guilty for getting others involved, and the type that want others to fall in love with it. They get a kick out of seeing others get taken by it like they have already."
32,"&gt; The guy checked out

Nice double entendre there."
33,"Did you have any afterlife experiences?

Have the doctors established why your body and mind  have been able to come back?

Do you have any permanent secondary effects?

Good to see you're still kicking it! Stay healthy "
34,I do binge drink on occasion when the flashbacks overwhelm me but not as often as I used to. I do fight suicidal thoughts nearly constantly and have attempted about three times a few years ago. I have no dreams. I often ask myself what I should dream or what I would have if I could have anything but it's like I've been so ground down by living with the constant triggers and flashbacks and horrors of what I've been through that I feel lucky just to survive and I wonder if the part of me that could dream died a long time ago...

36,"One guy asked if I got paid and I looked at him blankly. He realized I was a slave and said he ""had to do something to help me out."" I wasn't sure what to think... would accepting the money mean being a voluntary prostitute? Would my dad kill me if he found out?? Would it be enough to try running away and starting a new life? The guy gave me ten bucks. Other than that, johns didn't care or try to help. In general they were really quite violent.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't work. I struggle with PTSD, panic disorder, insomnia and other issues as a result of my trauma.

&amp;nbsp;

I have no support system because my family was so messed up. Since I hide inside as a result of my trauma I also have no friends except one or two people I communicate with online occasionally. "
37,"I really enjoy helping people. When people come back to me and say thank you or they enjoyed their time where I suggested, that makes me feel like I did my job properly and it makes me happy. I want every person to have a good time on vacation and I try my best to make sure that happens. "
38,Aww if only I could afford a trip lol
39,What can we steal without being charged a fee afterwords?
40,"Be careful. Just because you've gotten away with it for this long doesn't mean it can't come back on you. I actually have first hand experience of this coming back on a person being vetted for a director level position. Managerial and below, they generally don't care. Once you go higher than that, expect thorough background checks. At that level, the issue is no longer not having the degree, it's more the fact that you lied.

41,"Yes and yes. I didn't talk much at the informal one my uncle had as his house growing up. But did befriend one girl there who I believe was later killed. As a teen there was a much more formal one where I witnessed several deaths. Because of the frequency of my being there and the way I was always looking out for other girls I was left very informally ""in charge"" for long periods and witnessed several deaths I felt personally responsible for not preventing. 

&amp;nbsp;

I had friends growing up, although I went through a lot of bullying and loneliness at various times thanks, in part, to the frequent moving. In high school I spent several years in one spot and got a couple of closer friends for a while there. "
42,Do you know all 5 movements?
43,"I became more aware/'involved' (going into the sex dungeon, meeting the playmates) as I got older, so the most interesting stories are from my teen years I suppose.

When I was a teenager my mom started to get serious with this one guy. They had a collaring ceremony, which is kind of like a wedding abut with more kinky sex. Since it was kind of a big thing I came along to the party. The dude being collared was naked (most of them were naked) and knelt down on one knee. His ball sack actually scraped the ground. I found that interesting. My mom tripping on mushrooms at the time. A submissive transwoman made some killer dip. A couple of (naked) men carried a mattress off into the woods (we live on an isolated plot of land). I assume they had sex of some kind on it, though I don't know where nor do I know where the mattress is now. When I tried going to sleep, I couldn't because a group of people in the living room kept spanking someone. Other people cheered them on. All in all it was a good night. Not much of a story in the traditional conflict resolution sense.

When I was 11 or so I helped my mother pick out a dildo trophy to be awarded at a sex party she was hosting. So that was also a thing."
44,Easy enough to provide photos of your credentials with your name blacked out. I'm not at all convinced this is legit.
45,"There are lots of reasons I don't want to be a parent, but I will give you some of the main ones. They're not in any order, I just like to make numbered lists.

1. I am mentally ill and I have a strong family history of mental illness on both sides. I don't want to pass on any mental illness to any potential child. 

2. Pregnancy/childbirth honestly terrifies me. I used to have pregnancy nightmares about once every week or so, but since the surgery, the only pregnancy nightmare was one about my boyfriend being pregnant, and I even knew in the dream that it wasn't real.

3. I am on various medications for mental illness, as mentioned before. If I were to ever get pregnant and want to keep the baby safe, I would have to stop taking those medications for fear of harm to the fetus. I'm not really able to live my life or function ""normally"" without medication. I'm not willing to do this to myself for 9 months.

4. I feel like I'm somewhat of an irresponsible person, and although I would care about and love my potential child, I probably wouldn't be a good parent. I can barely be consistent enough to pass my classes in school and show up to work on time, and having/raising a kid is a ton of work. I don't trust myself to raise a child properly.

5. This isn't a personal reason, but the world doesn't really need more children in it. If I wanted a kid, there are plenty of kids who need to be adopted. I have no reason to prefer a kid with my DNA over a kid without it. "
46,5 years is a pretty long time to be maintaining a fairly large lie like that with your SO. Do you think you'll ever tell her? Do you worry about repercussions with her specifically were she to find out?
47,"It seems like to do heroin you need to be taught certain skills with the spoon and all that other shit. Did you ask for someone to teach you or did someone talk you into it? I guess I'm asking because I feel like if I was a heroin user, I would feel guilty teaching someone how to use. I hope that didn't come off as judgy. I'm in no way shape or form morally sound enough to call out someone for teaching someone to use. I'm just curious because it seems like such an involved process."
48,I found some child porn on his computer and tablet.  Then my mother approached about my cousin and aunt who accused him of molesting them.

52,"My opinion isn't worth much. I'm just a stranger on reddit. But I kinda feel if no one else is going to do it you're ethically and morally obligated to be the one.

I'm honestly drawing a blank on services not offered people ask for. Sorry :( if I think of something I'll edit. "
