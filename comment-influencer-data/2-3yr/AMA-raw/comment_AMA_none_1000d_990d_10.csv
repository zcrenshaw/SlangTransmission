0,"Not to hijack your AMA, but I feel like I have some good information to pass on.


I had my eye removed when I was one and half. I am now 17. My dad had the genius idea of treating me like any other child, do this. Also, play catch all the time, develop his hand eye coordination. It will be slow to start but it will definitely help in the long run. He may have issues when walking about, I tend to trip on the slightest of changes in height as I do not see it. He will most likely develop quick reactions to stop him from failing, but the tripping may never stop. 


I trust they will give you an artificial eye, now sometimes they don't tell you, or possibly dependant on your healthcare situation, get it cleaned every 6 months. I sometimes put it in a glass of salt water overnight to clear up residue. Note that after it is taken out it may be uncomfortable back in for up to an hour, so maybe don't do this when he is so young you can't explain it to him. I often get a build up of gunge around the artificial eye throughout the day, cotton wool balls are handy for dealing with this. 


Sorry if this sounds a bit militarian, if you have anymore questions feel free to reply, as people may go through a similar experience."
1,"I am a Nigerian prince. Ask me questions. But first, I need help, send me $10,000 and I'll repay you $50,000 in a month. My kingdom thanks you. "
2,"I didn't cook meth, I just sold it. And I don't have a disabled kid or a cunt of a wife... so no.
It did involve a lot of violence though. Violence and crazy people."
3,Do you ever call them your twovulas?
4,Just say Mormon it's quicker that way. 
5,"No, bitches love the Heelys."
6,"They don't respect my life choices, a radical family that allows no drinking or smoking, my friends must be approved by them first, and of course my sex life was non existent till the age of 29"
7,Go on Reddit.
8,You ever take em off any sweet jumps?
9,"I met John Travolta in an elevator as a 14-year-old, at the church in Clearwater.  He was very nice to me, said hi, asked how I was, asked my name.  "
10,I was selling it to support my own addiction but despite that fact I didn't really see it as the evil thing that I see today. It took quite a few years of violence and seeing lives destroyed for me to change my perspective. Now I won't associate with anyone involved with it.
11,"When they were convinced I was possessed by a demon and needed exorcism, so they got me a cleric to spit holy water in my face, then made me drink something that gave me food poisoning"
12,"I'm safe for the moment, got a steady job, they can't find me, they are still chasing after me, they want their son back, to destroy everything I built and rebuild it their way, the ""right"" way"
13,"I'm really glad she's doing it - it takes a lot of balls to do what she's doing and I wish I could do the same thing.  So far the things she's said about Scientology are pretty accurate.  My parents supported me when I left the Sea Org and we both came to the realization that we wanted to leave Scientology altogether about the same time, so we're all out.  My sister is still in though, which is why I am not publicly outspoken about the things I went through, and why I'm not divulging my identity here.  "
14,WTF?! which country do you live in? just want to make sure i never ever go there.
15,"Yes, I have three nipples."
16,"One time I went down a small ramp made for students with wheelchairs.

That was fun.

**EDIT:** Actually, I was once at school at around 7pm and I had the hallways all to myself."
17,Do you take the heelys off when slaying the puss?
18,Threats? They sound fucking lovely.
19,Or really anyone who was on dr Phil would be interesting 
20,"I was told meth is like every bad scary thing Nancy Reagan said about drugs brought to life, did you know the poison you were pushing or were you just trying to make ends meet?"
21,What do you do with all the extra time you save by having wheels on your shoes?
22,Uh hello. His motivation was to wreck the souls of his enemies
23,Definitely treat yourself to Napoleon Dynamite if you've never seen it before
24,Nice try Steve Harvey..
25,"I don't hate Palestinians, I hate terrorists, Israeli terrorists and Palestinian terrorists, I think blind hate  is awful, from Palestinians and from Israeli citizens."
26,"The church of Scientology has people who are parishioners, basically those who take services at the church - you know, Scientologists.  And then they have people who work for the church.  Of the people that work for the church, there are staff members, who sign a 2 1/2 year or 5 year contract, and there are Sea Org members, who sign a billion year contract (no joke) and work at only certain locations of the church, delivering the ""higher"" levels of Scientology and making up management of the church.  The church also has a ship, called the Freewinds, which is a cruise ship where Scientologists go to take services.  I was in the Sea Org from age 15 to almost 21 and worked the entire time on the Freewinds until I got out in 2000."
27,"They know I'm alive, they stalk my social media accounts, and sometimes make fake accounts to send me threats"
28,"Please measure and get back to me. Come equipped to AMAs next time please, 2/10. "
29,The General over here is doing God's work
30,OP has not replied yet. Can we assume he is dead?
31,Have you got super powers yet?
32,Do you have 2020 vision
33,"From the time I insisted that I wanted to leave until the time they let me leave, it was six months. They kept trying to convince me to stay through various methods. Sometimes it was through being nice and understanding, and sometimes it was through yelling and screaming and guilt tripping.  I didn't have my passport so I couldn't just leave, and besides, if I did just leave, I would have been declared a Suppressive Person and my parents would have had to have either disconnected from me or have left Scientology.  

I ended up being allowed to leave after I threatened to kill myself.  I became a bad PR risk and they left me go about 48 hours later."
34,"Cops said I should respect my elders and it's just going to be a beating, nothing that hurtful, I should just call and apologize, refused to file a report by a son against his parents"
35,To thumbs.
36,"I don't. I have a serious fear of organized religion and have trouble getting comfortable with people who identify as religious. However, I do consider myself spiritual and have discovered some healing through traditional native practices and beliefs. "
37,I was never caught doing anything illegal so I have no criminal record to interfere with my employment prospects.
38,"I was hanging out with my girlfriend, her sister, and said sister's (rich) boyfriend last Christmas. We were watching on of the Mummy movies on TV when out of the blue the boyfriend just says ""We used to live next door to him"" (Fraser). 

One up competition was won before it started. "
39,Awkward when you get uvula and vulva confused 
40,"I did go to Scientology schools off and on, yes.  I had good experiences in them for the most part.  I was able to move at my own pace and because I was really motivated, I graduated high school at 14.

The most difficult part was figuring out how to live when you're indoctrinated to think that doing anything for yourself is selfish and wrong.  I spent a lot of time kind of in limbo, working at various jobs but not having the courage to pursue something that maybe didn't have a lasting impact on the world in some profound way.  I still struggle with kind of a loss of purpose.  I have a career I love now, but I also have a lot of existential angst.

I'm fascinated with North Korea.  The control of information is probably similar.  I'd rather be in the Sea Org than in North Korea though.  As bad as it was, I was always fed and I never feared for my life.

"
41,"Physical harm to me and my wife, they sent a PI to find me once, slashed my tires, sent me pictures of myself to prove they have me, so I had to run again and change jobs, sold that car as well"
42,#HeelysForYourFeelys Avid Heely supporter here. Whats the best trick youve done?
43,Meet any celebrities?
44,"And 45,000,000 (ish) legal immigrants who would agree with me. There are more people who would agree with me than the entire population of Canada."
45,"I used to buy from a guy who would conduct all transactions while pointing the business end of a shot gun at me. He was pretty unhinged but we got along well so I was pretty sure he wasn't going to shoot me. I was a little concerned about him sneezing though.

There was also a guy who used to buy from me named Marshal but every weekend he would take a bunch of ecstacy and meth and turn into his alter ego ""Murphy"" for the next 3 days. Was a totally different person, it was bizarre and hilarious."
46,Yeah the sweetest
47,"""A"" for effort NSA."
48,"The short answer is no.  I was verbally and emotionally and mentally abused.  I was deprived of sleep, yelled at, and lived under constant stress.  I didn't get to see my family very often at all.  I was just a kid and I didn't have my parents or really any guiding adult there for me.  But, I do have some fond memories.  I made some good friends who are now also out and we stay in touch.  I have some friends who are unfortunately still in - I'm really sad about that.  I hope they make it out someday.  I also saw a lot of the Caribbean and Mexico, and I did manage to do some fun things.  You know, it's like an abusive relationship. It's not all bad, but the good parts don't make up for it.  It still affects me today."
49,"Congratulations on your escape. It can be very hard. What do you mean by ""I'm on the run""? Are the parents still pursuing you? What do they want? Are you safe? "
50,"I'm considered an apostate in the church, any member of my family who contacts me can be expelled from the church. Unfortunately that means i've had no contact with them in over 10 years. EDIt: actually its worse than that, even members of my family who are not members of the church but reside with those who are cannot contact me. "
51,"I watched all of it. It didn't really bother me. There were things that rang true... mostly in dealing with junkies. As I said, I had nothing to do with cooking meth and my dealings weren't nearly as high scale as in the show so I didn't personally relate to either of the main characters too much. One thing I did relate to was Walters transition from a pussy to a bad motherfucker out of neccesity so that he could do his job and survive."
52,Don't be rude. You're talking to the god damn prince of Nigeria!
53,honestly the answer to your question is reindeer onesie. because sometimes clothes are overrated.
54,"Oh yeah I had a hard time. I was really socially retarded initially.  I didn't get nuances, like if someone said they'd call me later, I would get really upset if they didn't at the exact time they said they would. I didn't understand that sometimes people just say shit.  I felt like I was from a different planet. Dating was really difficult because I had zero experience - I had never even been on a date, never kissed a guy. I remember one time a guy kissed me on NYE, the first one I experienced after the Sea Org, and I called him aftrwards expecting that we'd begin dating. On the other hand, I was like a prodigy when it came to work. I was used to working like 18 hour days so an 8 hour day was nothing. I excelled in whatever jobs I got and I had a good work ethic. 

I spent a lot of years feeling really angsty. I thought everyone was a dishonest asshole in society. I'd hold everyone up to almost impossible standards. 

"
55,How do you plan on stopping wide spread Trolling?
56,It seems that religion is only a fraction of the problem and that the real problem is that they are overly controlling and manipulative people. You have done the right thing cutting them out of your life completely. There is no reasoning with some people. Take good care of yourself and maintain no contact until they are in their mid 80s. That's when even the most fervent people tend to mellow and become less dangerous.....
57,"Had Heelys in elementary school when they first came out. God I loved those things. Nothing like having a perfectly smooth floor with a slight decline to coast down. I wish they were socially acceptable as a mid-20 year old. My question is: How old are you, and how do I learn to not give a fuck about what people think of me?"
58,"
What do you think they would do if they found out where you were? Probably beat me and my wife
What religion do they follow? Muslims
Are you male or female and what does your SO think of the situation with your family? I'm male and my wife helps me on the bad days, she's been on the run with me
Do you have siblings and are they all still with your parents? 1 sister who helps them with the technology of it, she knows ppl who can track me by my phone number, What do they think about your escape? The pronounced me dead and I heard they had a funeral "
59,"Most definitley. I only used it recreationally at first but my usage escalated pretty quickly and once that happened I had to sell it to afford how much I was using. I smoked away most of my profits.

Hard to say about long term effects as I already had issues with depression and anxiety but I think it definitly made them worse. I've since spent over a decade on various medications to treat this, all unsuccessfully. Now I medicate myself with marijuana and haven't needed any pharmaceutical drugs for over 3 years and I am living a generally happy life.

That being said I saw a lot of other people spiral into oblivion both physically and mentally from it."
60,"It started with the realization that the church was taking over my life and that my family's behavior had changed so much since joining the church 10 years earlier. In our church you had to devote all of your time outside of school or work to the church, that meant meetings, youth groups, worship services. You were also pressured even as a child to recruit others into the church despite the risk (bullying, violence etc). I was kicked out of my parents house for questioning church doctrine on certain things. thus began a vicious cycle of church members attempting to have me commited to an inpatient mental facility, sabotaging my attempts to find work/housing/government assistance. It came to the point at 21 where I finally had to move away from my hometown to escape the church. "
61,"Actually i was just talking to one of my friends who left the church shortly after I did and we recalled a funny memory. I left the church in  2005 and she in 2008. We both recieved calls from the church on December 19 2012 informing us that even though we were no longer members of the church they would be happy to have us join them the evening of the 21st to spend the night in the church due to the apocalypse. So that was...strange. As for my personal life, I cannot return to my hometown as its not safe for me there because of the large number of church members. I have been denied jobs based on my status in the church, I was kicked out of high school because of that status. Currently, i'm far enough away that they hold no influence, I finished high school a few years late but because of Ptsd related to my family experience growing up in the church, chances of me being able to work are slim to none. I've been through 4 years of trauma therapy to even get to a point where I can live day to day without having massive panic attacks.

edit: tl;dr you're never really free of the church unless you put a huge geographic space between you and them."
62,"the church controls everything, including how children are raised and disciplined. Common punishments for parenting in the church are starvation (food and shelter are a privilege granted by god and at the discretion of the parents), being confined to your home except to attend church school or work (enforced by members of the church watching your home). In my case it was common practice in my home for me to be locked out after school until a parent arrived home until finally I had questioned things enough that i was no longer allowed to reside with church members"
63,...where the fuck do you live man. Thats super fucked up. This is stalking and nearing abuse. 
64,That makes you a Nigerian Prince...so start answering questions dude
65,They're obviously not going to post here if they are truly off the grid. 
66,"Right now he has a temporary one, and it is clear. In about 6-8 weeks, as the mucus membrane they placed in the empty socket heals with the muscles, he will start getting fit for his real one, that will match the other eye. It takes 5 visits to get the prosthetic made, from sizing and shaping, to actually hand-painting it to match as closely as possible the colors of his working eye. 
As for how many he will have to have - that we don't know yet. Your eyes really do not ""grow"" very much throughout your life, at least not as much as you'd think. I've spoken to other people who had eyes removed at a young age, and most of them have only had a couple, if that, their entire life. One of the main reasons he may need a new one first is because he's so young, it's possible his eye color could change, and he would get an updated one."
67,Do you really have a box stuck in customs?
