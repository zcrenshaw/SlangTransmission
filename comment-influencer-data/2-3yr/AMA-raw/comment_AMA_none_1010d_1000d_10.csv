1,"I am 64 and have been single for a very long time after a 15 year marriage. Believe me, there is NOTHING lonelier than being lonely in a marriage. Lonely alone is so much easier. I am finding, even at my age, that the more self-content I get; the more I delete anger and fear from my life; the more I laugh and be my weird self - the more men start coming around and tell me how special and unique I am. No one in this world can make you happy and if you drop that need onto someone, the relationship will fail anyway. So be your weird self (we are ALL weird), find ways to remove all fear and anger from your life and do something crazy you really want to do. Then do that again. Life will be so full of surprises,  you'll stop thinking about being alone. Go see Arrival. We are all connected. You will find your people if you just try.
(This was a disjointed ramble, but I hope you get the message within the stream-of-consciousness mess.)"
2,OH GOD YOU'RE RIGHT
3,Not as much the pussy I'm slaying.
4,Does your penis ever hurt from how often you get laid? 
5,It's most definitely not
6,"I was in the exact same situation you are currently in, I was the nice guy that girls didn't want to date. Up till the age of 32, the longest relationship I was in was 3 months. One day two things happened, I wrote down exactly what I wanted in a woman, even writing down a nice to have which was a cottage. I also fixed myself as well, studying the six needs of humans (certainty, uncertainty, significance, love/connection, growth and contribution).
The incredible happened, I met my best friend, who was looking for the nice guy. At the time I met her, I was unemployed, no car and my employment insurance was ending that month, she offered to pick me up and take me out for dinner. Within 1 year we were married, currently have two beautiful daughters and I cannot believe I have the perfect person for me. I got exactly what I wanted from the list I created, along with an awesome cottage her family owns. 

So it is far from over, fix yourself first, write down what you want and be open to the opportunities that present itself, the right person is waiting for you!"
7,Do you wish you would've capitalized Real and Joke? 
8,"Considering Canada has immigration laws that it strictly enforces, my guess is that the number of people who have moved there within a month is close to zero. The process for Canadian citizenship is a long, arduous task that requires the applicants to have a steady job, money, and marketable skills that another Canadian worker doesn't already possess."
9,"There was this older gentleman (I use this term for a reason) who was always unfailingly polite to me.  He would always make a point to ask how I was doing, as if he really cared.  I blew it off as an inmate trying to butter me up to get something out of me, but it never came to that.  It was the same politeness every day.

I finally decided to look up why this very polite, nice, hardworking man was in prison, assuming it was for some non-violent crime.  Boy was I wrong.

Multi-state rape/abduction/killing/necrophelia of women with my hair and eye color.  That was when I realized he was nice to me because I was his victim type.  Made my skin crawl."
10,"Got you bro. Since I left, I eventually moved back, though, so hopefully you get some better candidates as well.

1. Were you planning it for awhile? It was kind of impulsive but I only planned it out for about a month.

2. Why did you do it? Ugly breakup with my long term gf, my close friends were all dying and going to jail (heroin). It's expensive to live here and cheap where I moved.

3. Did you change your name or phone number, etc? My phone number. 

4. Did you tell your family? My mom and my older brother only.

5. Did you do it despite others' wishes? I didn't really tell anyone but my best friend and close family. My boy was upset but he understood.

6. Did you tell people once you got to the new place? I updated my place of residents on facebook, which made a status update. People were shocked, some were upset with me.

7. How did you get a job and make new friends? I got a job 3 days after I moved because I have a ton of experience in my field. I made friends from work and school. I met a girl at work and dated her for a few months.

8. Do you regret it? Not really, but I had to come back after a year. It was a good experience though.

9. How has it changed you? Surprisingly, yes. I am not so attached to places or even people anymore, for better or for worse. 

10. Did you try to be a different person in the new place? Not really. I had stories and stuff from back home and it makes people interested in your story so I didn't purposefully change myself, altough I changed slightly as a person."
11,Wait... Countries actually enforce immigration laws? They must be racist.
12,Proof?
13,"Nah that would have made me badass though. But you know the stereotype of 26 year old guys that hit up 14 year old girls on Kik? Traced a few of those.
And the 24 year old dudes with a server or their computer STACKED with cheese pizza? Traced a few of those too. 
Can't forget the 19 year old females that hit up 14 year old boys but plottwist the 19 year old female is actually a dude named Mason who isn't what that 14 year old was looking for. "
14,"same, except mine's an anagram for adolf hitler!"
15,"Have you ever said ""On the one hand, I can see where you're coming from, but on the other hand..."" and then just trail off and look at the stump sadly?

Because I would do that all the time."
16,No. I did it this way that way I wouldn't forget my username.

18,"It was with a tour group yes,but it was sanctioned by some embassy's to get a bit higher access.
But it was also with members of the Swedish embassy and a few other more neutral countrys, so it was formal yet relaxed at the same time.



Compared to my Expectations.

I expected some quasi sierra lione type Shit hole.
But it was different.
Not Great,But diffrent

It was   the easiest way i can put it.
Like stepping into a place that is sort of frozen in time,Or a place that time forgot even.

Everything looks New,but odly new from like the 60s-70s so you can tell that the manufacturing sector is just so outdated. as new to the streets would of been new for us in the 70s

Pyongyang is weird.
It sort of reminds me of a 1970s style soviet city block Just on a city wide scale.

The main artery roads are paved and almost brand new.
But there is no cars to drive on them.
The highway into the city was 6 lanes wide yet not even enough cars to cause traffic in one lane.

However you get a bit deeper in and you start to notice roads are not paved.
Anything that  is not straight in your face seems to have no care applied to it.



HOLY FUCK THO the  enviroment was bonkers.
they have some of if not the most pristing parklands i have seen.

You literally get jailed for despoiling the woods in any way.

They have rare species of tigers that are pretty much only found their..

21,"For anyone interested in the true story: Hitler's barber was August Wollenhaupt, who cut his hair and trimmed his moustache every 14 days since 1932. He was sentenced to two years on probation in 1948, at the age of sixty. I can't find anything on his death right now, but considering he would be 128 years old today, we can safely assume he is not sitting beside our trollster OP answering questions.

32,Nick valentine does ...
33,Yes. Although I haven't spoken to him in a while as I don't want him to have my address and know where I live with my children. I expect I will speak to him in the future. I am the only person who has spoken/written/visited him since the murder other than his immediate family. 
34,"Depends on the context. 
For web browsing I really don't do that much to protect myself. Just a VPN.
In terms of electronic banking, only do that stuff on SECURE networks that you know are well protected, on a computer you don't watch weird porn on. You should probably avoid e banking entirely if you're paranoid. 
My personal information is secured by remaining non digital. I have never once actually entered in anything extremely important online such as SSN or credit card numbers. If you're making online purchases from smaller vendors such as Wish (Which allows all the small Chinese businesses with likely bad security) Use paypal rather than your credit card. In general the safest way to protect your info is encryption, or don't put it online. "

42,"The MOST disturbing thing? Between the two things I've mentioned, the brutal animal torture, or the children being raped and tortured, it'd have to be the children. My mind hasn't been scarred, but it is something you can't really just forget about."
43,"It's sad to talk about..
I was working undercover at a distribution hub looking for theft. There was a guy there who used to sell porn to all of us. He would drive his forklift around and hand out DVDs.. Turns out he actually made child porn on the side. After 6 months I finally got some of the homemade child porn DVDs and unfortunately had to watch them so I could testify in court. He's still in jail."
44,"Naw, but I'm looking forward to the opportunity."
45,Obviously our friendship is on very different terms now that he is a convicted murderer and now that I have children. I still care for him and we still share a very long history of friendship and shared experiences but I do not trust him and would not feel safe spending time with him outside of prison. 
46,"I do. Honestly. I really do. But I know they're working on seizing as many of those kinds of websites as possible and taking every one of those people to prison where they belong. I've found several CP sites which have been seized by the FBI, which is VERY GOOD. We have to realize and remember, the U.S. Military were the ones who created the Deep Web to get information wherever they wanted securely and released the codes for it after a while. I just feel like they should've known something like this would've happened."
47,"Don't you feel some moral obligation to report on the stuff you're seeing (to the FBI, Interpol, etc)? I mean, those kids."
48,"I kept going because it's mainly SO BIG. You always hear people and even the media say the clearnet (everything Google picks up) is just the tip of the iceberg, and the deep net is everything down below. That is why I keep going, I know that there's a lot that I don't know about to be explored. It's just the whole secrecy and mystery behind it. Nobody knows how far the rabbit hole goes, but I wanna climb in and see how long it takes before I decide to climb back up and stop. "

50,"I very much frequent the AlphaBay Marketplace. It's just really interesting to see the type of things you can buy, and it seems to be the only real trusted marketplace on the deep web as of now. To answer your question, are there as many positives as there are negatives, It just depends on how much the person values their privacy on the Internet. It mostly just depends on what kind of person you are really. It's hard to be traced by anyone, unless you come across a good hacker or some FBI agent who knows you're doing bad things and wants to find you. It's just good to know you can do and say whatever you want without having someone interfere. It's also cool just to know you can actually buy 3 random people's Netflix accounts for 15 cents. I know that was random, but I find it extremely interesting."
51,"Nice try, big pharma."
52,"I can only go by what he says as the only other people who were present when it happened are dead.

They were living together and returned home to the house after a party. They were arguing and threatening each other. They both went for their guns and he got his first.

Yes, he regrets it. The man he killed was his best friend. 

Yes, I feel I could have prevented it. He was living far away and I convinced him to move back home. He had a lot of addiction/mental health issues and I could have offered more support once he moved back. "
53,Bob Ross was a Master Sergeant in the Air Force; not an officer and not someone who has soldiers serving under them.
54,OP could go to prison just for looking at it.
55,No.
56,I'm disturbed just knowing that it's out there.
57,"There's a guy on the AlphaBay Market that I know of, He's selling Netflix accounts at $0.15, and I think Spotify ones at $1.50. I wanted to see if they were actually legit, and 2/3 he sent actually worked. It's kind of random with how many you'll get in one order. It's more of a gamble as you can get anywhere from 2-5 accounts in one order. He did say in the description of the post, that if any of the accounts didn't work, then to just message him and tell him the sale number and what account didn't work. I ended up doing that and he sent me around 3 more accounts. And it was kind of like a never ending cycle until all the accounts he sent me worked. I just wanted to see how far I could go with it, but that was that. I don't even watch Netflix, but 15 cents for a couple accounts seemed too unreal, but that's why I tried it. I don't plan to use the accounts or do anything with them, but they do work, and Netflix accounts seem to have a big underground market."
58,"I've seen various videos of animals being beaten and tortured, and then uploaded to a forum entirely dedicated to that type of stuff. Unwillingly, and by accident, I've seen kids (anywhere from the age of 5-16) being raped, tortured and even killed. I came across a website called ""Dark Scandals"" which is basically, you pay them, and they give you a folder with maybe GIGABYTES of blackmail and rape videos. I don't know for sure but that's what's on their site.  You really gotta watch what you click on there. There can be a lot of Trojan Horses, not like the viruses, but just things like video files pretending to be like a tutorial, and then it turns out to be something like one of the videos I've mentioned. It all goes back to watching what you do on there. It can be a vicious place, but you just have to watch out."
59,Did you food take Guy Fieri to Flavortown?
60,"yeah im on the train back home right now so ill link some of the photos i got ""approved"" when i get home  on wed-thu.

Yes. we had a  official from the govt with us.
But they were actually rather accommodating with us talking to locals.

I think they had less worry as the areas we could talk to locals in where ""well off""  well as well off as you can get in North Korea so the people  had high praises.

However the tune does change.
People in our group noticed at one point when we got off a bus.
The rep from the govt had to go to the bathroom,Almost as soon as he was out of sight locals where WAY WAY WAY more forthcoming in talking to us  for a few mins.


A lot of them seem to have the education lacking that is clearly evident.
As they thought that ""captain cook"" was only like 100 years ago.As i asked some of them what they thought of australia

"
61,"I cant tell, maybe he nailed it."
62,"That's an interesting question! 

For starters, don't assume that every small Appalachian town has a large KKK group in it. While this group does still exist in this country, they are an extremely tiny minority. Nowadays they are looked down upon and very much outcast in small mountain communities. So definitely don't assume every person is going to be an ignorant racist, it's just not the case. I've never seen anyone dressed in a robe and hood in my entire life, and if they do show up then locals are usually quick to run them off.

Do expect certain customs to be followed by every person you meet, and don't be upset by any of them. It's like breathing for us in these communities, we just do certain things others think are weird. We're never in a hurry to get about our business and will take the time to ALWAYS do certain things.

Such as; holding a door for anyone you see coming in or out even rushing over if they're far away to hold it for you.

We've never met a stranger. Polite conversation dictates that practically the same things are said in every interaction you have with a local or out of towner. It goes something like this;
""Hi! How are you/y'all doing today""
""Well I'm doing pretty good ma'am/sir, how are you doing today?""
""I'm doing just fine thank you! What can I do for ya?""
Exchange of greetings and asking how someone is doing occurs every time. Don't be offended and think they're being nosy because you're not from there. This is just our custom. As is the end of an interaction.
""Is there anything else I can do for ya today?""
""No ma'am/sir, thank ya so much I 'ppreciate ya.""
""You're welcome, you take care of yourself ya hear?""
""You do the same, we'll see ya around! Bye bye!""
""Bye bye!""
People tend to think we're xenophobic and asking things about others cause we don't trust them. In reality we're just raised that it's rude not to have some form of the above conversation take place every single time.

I'll give one more so I don't carry on too long.
A big don't.

Please don't mistake the way we sound and our way of doing things as a sign of unintelligence. No one who has had to build their own house, grow and slaughter their own food, and raise a family on one of the lowest incomes in the country is stupid. I'd like to see others not from here try to do the same. Acting like they are dumb or assuming a superior arrogance towards them by referring to us as Hicks, hillbilly's, rednecks, or backwater people is a sure fire way to offend someone.

We're mountain folk, that we are proud to be called. Some may have not completed high school or gone to college, but many also have. No one is above anyone else, and treating everyone you see like a family member is important to us. Just because the vast majority may be of a certain political leanings doesn't mean they're idiots. They, like everyone else, endorse what they feel represents their beliefs and values most closely. Rarely will anyone ever discuss politics, not because they don't understand it, but because they don't want to offend anyone.

Oh and one last thing....
Don't bring up the movie Deliverance or make an incest joke around them. I've never seen anything like the way we're depicted in that movie. Cousinf(.   )r is extremely taboo and honestly, who does that? No one lol. Thanks for the question!!"

74,"Finally, one I can take part in! Get ready for a wild ride. TL;DR added at the bottom. 


About two years ago I packed a backpack and moved from a small rural city to Toronto. There were a lot of factors, but to answer your questions:


*1. Were you planning it for awhile?*

  I decided to move over the course of a day. A friend of mine from highschool (I was 22 at the time of moving) messaged me on Facebook saying he had moved to Toronto and had started working in a board game cafe. I had been unemployed for 3-4 months at the time and the next day he had talked to his boss and told me if I could get to Toronto by 11am the next day, I had a job interview. I was really unsure, something in my gut told me it was worth a shot. I jumped on a train and left the next morning with only $20 in my bank account. I got the job. 



*2. Why did you do it?* 

 There were a few factors, one being that I needed a job which was difficult to find while living in the middle of nowhere. I had worked in a retirement home for a couple of years which had been sold and I was laid off. I was living with my parents at the time and was able to coast through the summer on employment insurance, but I was miserable. I've always had a history of depression and anxiety but thought I had outgrown it in my teen years. It all came back that summer. I was suicidal. I would listen to Elliot Smith and lay in the bath tub for hours a day just contemplating whether it was worth it. I was also engaged at the time. I had a lovely fiance who loved me very much, but lived in Virginia. We had met online and though I had doubts about the relationship, I figured once we were together (I was planning on moving in with him in Virginia) things would solve themselves. I was naive, and I think I knew that all along that what I was doing was wrong. I knew I was too young to get married and felt bad about stringing this guy along, who was obviously head over heels for me. I didn't want to break his heart, I didn't want to do anything at that point really. So, out of desperation I decided giving this whole Toronto thing a chance was worth the one last shot to make my life feel valuable. 



*3. Did you change your name or phone number, etc?*

 I changed my phone number, but in general I was still pretty easy to reach. If anyone really wanted to, they could have gotten a hold of me through social media.



*4. Did you tell your family?*

 I told my family the night before I left. They were extremely supportive and knew that I was going through a lot of darkness. I told them everything, how I didn't love my fiance anymore and how I thought of killing myself everyday. My parents rode me a bit for not opening up to them months earlier, when things started to get bad. However, in the end it was my dad that helped me through it and pushed me to get on that train. He kept telling me ""Think of it as a break, it might last just one day, a couple weeks, a few months, or forever. Regardless you will always have a place to come back home to if things get too hard or don't work out. There is no risk in going and trying, and if you don't try you may regret the missed opportunity."" And then he dropped me off at the station.



*5. Did you do it despite others' wishes?*

 My fiance was very confused. He couldn't understand why I was moving to another city all by myself months before our visa was due to be approved. I was still too young and selfish to just break up with him. Honestly, things seem clearer in hind sight but at the time I honestly believed that if I got through this depression then I would want to be with him again. He wanted me to be happy, so he reluctantly gave me the go ahead to try things out, but I could tell it really bothered him that I was moving even farther away from him. 



*6. Did you tell people once you got to the new place?*

 At first, I slept on my high school friend's floor for a week. My parents knew I had gotten the job, and I was starting to look for a place to live. The next week I slept on my brother's couch. My brother and I were not close due to some family drama in my teen years. However it was comforting knowing that we were family, and he was there to put a roof over my head when I needed it. Also he had two cats so that was nice. 



*7. How did you get a job and make new friends?*

 I already went over how I got my job, and I made my new friends through working there. The first three months living in Toronto were tumultuous though. I experimented with drugs and went out late, things I had no interest in before. I broke up with my fiance. At some point I realized that I needed to do a lot of growing up before I was ready to commit myself to anyone. It broke his heart (though we still remain very close friends 2.5 years later). I moved into a townhouse that was a 45 minute subway ride away from the board game cafe. I lived with a manager from the cafe, his girlfriend, and the bartender. They starting getting into cocaine and overall things seemed very poisonous in that house, but I couldn't afford to live anywhere else. After a couple months I was working 65-80 hours a week at the board game cafe. The owners were also pretty shady, I'm 99% sure they stole the majority of my tips. 

 They 'promoted' me to a manager position after firing my roommate. They did this because the business was struggling and they couldn't afford to pay me the hours I was working, so instead they put me on a salary. I realized about 3 months in that I was not happy working my butt off for these people. Also, I started seeing the bartender that I worked with and also lived with. After a couple more months I found out he had been with his high school sweetheart the entire time. I was fired for having a relationship with him, and I was the other woman all along. It hurt, but I think he was really just a place holder to fill a void. I did not love him, he was just fun and dangerous and I had never experienced that before. Eventually I moved in with the barista and her boyfriend, got another job as an assistant manager at a burger place, and cut everyone toxic that I had met so far out of my life. I started over again in a way.


The only people I'm still in contact with are my current roommates, the barista and her now fiance. They are my best friends and the only real good to come out of my first few months in Toronto. The board game cafe has since been re-branded as a bar, still operated by the same scummy people.



*8. Do you regret it?* 

 The only thing I regret about the entire roller coaster of those few months were how I handle my relationship with my ex-fiance. Yes, we are still very good friends. However I hurt him much more than I could have if I had handled everything like a mature adult.  He is an amazing person and such a support for me, and I will do anything to repay him for how much he has helped me through out the years. I want to make up for the bad I've done to him, even if I can only do that by being his friend.



*9. How has it changed you? *

 Oh boy. I'm a completely different person from 2.5 years ago. I have a few very close friends, am dating a wonderful man for about a year now, have my own two cats, and work as a server in a french dine dining restaurant. I'm extremely happy with my life. The decision to move might have saved me, but it also made me a more confident and independent person. My life felt like a soap opera for awhile, and there was so much more stress, but also a lot more adventure and fun. I think, being 22 when I moved here, I really started to understand myself and become my own person once I moved to Toronto and started making it on my own. I think back to my time living in the middle of nowhere, how I almost rented a house for myself and settled in. I think I could have been happy living a small town life, but am grateful for the experiences I've had since coming to a big city. 



*10. Did you try to be a different person in the new place?*

 No. I was pretty much at the end of my rope when I got here. I had no reason to fake anything or care what people thought of me. In the end, being myself guided me to the people who I now hold very dear and helped me build a successful life. 



**TL;DR** Moved to Toronto out of desperation and depression. Broke up with my fiance, worked 80 hours a week for people treated me poorly, eventually moved in with amazing people and now 2.5 years later I love my life. "
75,Yes I live on a farm normally. In the recent flood of Louisiana my house unfortunately got flooded. I am currently living with family and a FEMA trailer is almost set up so that my family and I don't have to drive about 30 minutes put of the way.

Maybe you spend so much time with r/ama that now it's like that point in a relationship where you talked about all the interesting stuff but you're not really comfortable with long silences yet so you end up with, ""how was your day?"" and ""yeah, I really like mashed potatos too"".
