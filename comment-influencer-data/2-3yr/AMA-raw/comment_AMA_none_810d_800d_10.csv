0,"If all those conditions were actually the names of giant transformer robots, who do you think would win, Vulvodynia or Vaginismus?"
1,"male.

but I select female character in the games."
2,Haha. I'd say Vulvodynia. It brings THE PAIN. 
3,My nigga
4,"I have no freaking clue, not worth it."
5,"Today,I had physics test.
But, I couldn't make good score.

I have to study more. HAHA!

Thanks message!"
6,"Yeah, that's kind of a pain (not gonna say in the butt)!

When I'm at home I obviously don't have to worry about it, but while camping I usually just leave them in the car, bring a purse, or keep it with my towel (which nudists carry around everywhere for sanitary sitting purposes). I don't worry about people stealing them, because where exactly are they going to hide it?"
7,"Here's one of my favorites:

I was working in the France pavilion at Epcot. At the time, it was the only location where Belle could be seen with Beast for meet and greets. I had some amazing dudes that would fill in for Beast regularly and we had a great time playing off each other.

Since Beast is a ginormous, ferocious, fuzzy dude, many kids are afraid of him. On this one particular afternoon, a sweet little girl ran right up to Beast and gave him a flower. Beast was so moved by such a sweet fearless gesture that he immediately started looking around for something to give the little girl. He then proceeded to reach into the Disney-owned flower bed, rip a bunch of flowers from the soil (roots still dangling with dirt), and eagerly handed them to this little girl. It was exactly what one would expect the clumsy but lovable guy to do, and it was hilariously perfect."
8,"Nope. My doc recently prescribed a lidocaine jelly that numbs the area for a few hours so I have to use that before sex. Works during, but I get SEVERE uterine cramps after and I bleed like a period for a day or two. Then when the lidocaine wears off there is some residual irritation from the stretching/tearing.  
I'll put up with that over giving my husband a sexless marriage though. "
9,"Maybe not a question, but some advice... im 43 now, my father went to jail when I was a year old, served 13 years. In that time, I was close to his parents, but once he got out, I got weird about it, and cut them all off entirely. He once came to the house to see me, and I refused to go outside. Never saw him in person again. Zero contact with that side of the family. He died in 2001. 

My advice is: no matter what, make the effort to talk to him, visit him. Dont worry about any social problems with him having been in prison. I regret not re-connecting with my father due to a stupid decision I made when I was 13. You should definitley make the effort. Maybe pool some money to get him an iPad so you can FaceTime or something. Dont make the same mistake I did. "
10,Why?
11,No. Send help.
12,"Since your furniture is at risk, do you think you're more worried about sharts than the average person? "
13,"English, psychology, and geography.  To communicate clearly, while understanding the psychological influences playing upon the cultural  backgrounds of those to whom I am communicating."
14,This hoopy frood. Gotta respect a person who knows where his or her towel is. 
15,What degrees did you get and why?
16,This is one of the more brutal things I've read
17,"That's hilarious and terrible! I've never had that problem as far as I can recall, because I usually wear layers when I'm sick and might have that happen. Who wants to be cold while sick?"
18,r u ok?
19,absentmindedly *sticking a pencil behind my eye*
20,"My son is just a toddler right now, but we do take him to the camp with us. The place where we go has thorough background checks to keep out creeps, so I've never been worried about myself or him. We plan to raise him to know when nudity is ok and not appropriate. "
21,This reply is wonderful.
22,What things do you tell to banks? 
23,"I started a few years ago because my husband wanted to try it out and I said ""sure!""

Most common questions: How often do you hook up? What happens if a guy gets a boner? Can I have nudes? (The answers to which are: you're mixing up nudism and swingers, cover up with your towel and take a seat until it settles down, and no.)

I guess the biggest stereotypes are mostly sexual and/or that I'm constantly naked. I'd never go to a wedding or grocery shopping nude, just as you wouldn't do these things in a Halloween costume!"
24,"Accident or birth, my old friend burst one of his as a child when a heavy toilet seat fell on it when he was peeing. "
25,"Oh shit, it's weird to attend a wedding and grocery shop in a Halloween costume?"
26,"I haven't been to one of those, but here is my advice for general nudism: Make sure that you won't actually get in trouble for public nudity. Have a bag with you to keep your belongings in. Bring a towel so that you can sanitarily sit down. Know where you put your clothes! If there is a shower or swimming spot available, it's an easier transition since you bathe and shower naked usually. Consider putting your keys on a lanyard around your neck so that you don't lose them. It doesn't hurt to have backup clothes in the car. My gosh use sunscreen!!"
27,Omg it reminds me of those rubber toys that you squeeze and the eyes pop out hahah. It would be hilarious to knock on the door at Halloween and quickly pop them out hahah I would probably run straight past you and down the street ðŸ˜‚ how did you find out you can do that?
28,"No mods, I played it on PS4 sadly. I stopped three times for a 5 min bathroom break. My meals consisted of cheese sticks and Arby's that my brother had bought for me. But other then bathroom breaks It was nonstop. My body aches lol"
29,Where do you keep your phone and keys?
30,"Wow, thank you so much for this. This really helped me a lot as it definitely has been hard to stay connected with him, and especially since he's out now it's totally on me to decide where our relationship goes as he definitely wants to be a part of my life. I will definitely take your advice and make sure I see him before it's too late. I'm so sorry it couldn't turn out different for you too. Again, thank you."
31,"I read that, but it's been years. 

Ford, you're turning into a penguin. Stop it. "
32,"I've gotten mixed responses to this question. The problem is that they can't travel freely and there's just not much way to find out what people in other places think. No local news media, and people don't feel free to share any sort of skepticism with strangers. From what I can tell, the further you get away from Pyongyang, the less stock people put in those stories. The ones I know didn't spend much time thinking about those stories, anyway. They were too busy trying to get food."
33,"No, thanks.  But I'm telling you from true experience: Support education for the incarcerated.  An education not only helps prevent recidivism, but enlightens those most vulnerable to being influenced by the temptations of the world, the true agenda behind incarceration -- money making.  Education, also, helps those same people make better decisions, and provides them opportunities and abilities to not feel as if they have to commit crimes to get ahead."
34,Why did you cheat during the Tour de France?
35,"It's always been about the money, so privatization is capitalism at it's finest, or worst, extent.  The war on drugs is about money.  Come on.  II am white and was sentenced to thirty years for a consensual crime, while black guys were getting ten years and less for murder.  Literally, the day Judge Gifford sentenced me to thirty years, a black kid who murdered a white man during a drug deal, claiming he only intended to rob him, but the gun went off accidentally, was sentenced to eight years for ""involuntary homicide."" He had already been locked up in the county jail for 28 months, so was getting out in 20 months.  What message does this send to the youth of our nation?  Why do you suspect they are out there executing each other on the streets, now?  No consequences.  The system does not care about human lives, only about money...  That's why you get twenty years for bank fraud, but five for murder.  My attorney told me, "" It would have been better if you had killed the snitch, I could get you less time...""  I have a pretty successful, skilled-trade business, so as long I can physically work, I will..."
36,If you are going to stare at the butt of a character for close to a hundred hours wouldn't you want it to be a female butt???
37,"Yes it definitely has! Due to my situation I was very interested in our prison system going into college, and I actually ended up taking a course called an ""inside-out"" class, where university students go to a prison and take a class that is half students from the university, half students that are prisoners. That really opened my eyes to see that there are so many fundamental problems with the way our justice system works, and that it truly isn't created for the purpose of rehabilitation. I actually just recently wrote an essay about alternative options for adolescents and young adults that commit crimes, since I think there really needs to be a much larger focus on rehabilitating these people instead of locking them away in a prison cell. I could go on and on about this topic but overall I think the big take away for me was realizing how backwards the system is. "
38,How do nudists clean their glasses?
39,"Without going into too much detail, he was a real estate agent in the early 2000s (right before the market crash) and was involved in tax and mortgage fraud. "
40,"It would be a very bad day for me.

I'm always asked what I would do if they fell out one day and my answer has typically been along the lines of ""I have no idea"", but if you can do something and you do it often, you should probably be prepared for unexpected intances. So I asked an optometrist one day when I was getting my prescription on my glasses redone and this is what he told me: 

Your eye won't fall out and roll across the floor. If it were to fall out, it would hang by the optic nerve and dangle by your cheek. If that ever happens, hold it in a glass of water so it remains moist and go to the emergency room.

I made the mistake of asking him what I should do if there were no glasses of water available to me and he told me if I wanted to keep my eye, put it in my *mouth* and go to the emergency room.

If they came out and just kind of..got stuck, I would take a wet paper towel or something and keep it covered and, you guessed it, go to the emergency room.

I use the muscles of my eyes to push them out and hold them out, and I know just the point where they are bulging at maximum with no threat of popping all the way out. And I do believe the muscle is very much strong enough to do it.
"
41,"&gt;He told me if I wanted to keep my eye, put it in my *mouth* and go to the emergency room.

Fucking brutal"
42,"Nothing ""permanent"" for endometriosis. A hysterectomy has a small chance of helping but doctors refuse to do it on someone my age (usually you have to be 40-50). I am switching from a 3 week birth control to an IUD that last 5 years and that is supposed to help with that but I highly doubt it.  Endometriosis is an extremely under-treated disease that needs a specialist but I can't see one due to many reasons.   
Then for the vaginismus, my doc suggested pelvic floor physical therapy which is basically a PT sticking their fingers up my vag and ""re-teaching"" me and my muscles how to stop being so tight. I was going to do that but I'm so sick of having my vag touched by people that I opted for dilator therapy which is basically medical dildos. You start with a small size and work your way up and it keeps the vaginal canal stretched.  
For vulvodynia, it's not a well-known disease but I can continue with the lidocaine as necessary and if it gets to be too bad, there's a surgery called vestibulectomy where they remove a bunch of tissue in the area between under the urethra and just above the anus. It stops the nerves from being overactive and they remove some tighter muscle areas. I hope I don't have to go that far.  "
43,"The place is basically a resort.  The residents basically do whatever they want. Guidelines that might be enforced in other programs don't exist here.  They have us act a certain way that's designed to make it NOT seem like a rehab, but more like a retreat. "
44,"1. I spent most of my time as a bookworm brunette (that's Belle for those of you playing at home). Before face character training, I had to be trained in ""fur"" roles as well, e.g., Pluto, Rafiki, Mr. Smee. I spent most of my non-face shifts as Eeyore.

2. Parents: keep the magic alive. Don't ask Pluto if it's ""hot in there."" Don't remind your kids that ""this is a different Belle than the one you met yesterday."" It means SO much when you play along (I often had the most fun questions/comments from parents who talked to me instead of just shoving their kid forward for a few pictures!)
To the kids: don't be too eager to let go of that pixie dust. I've been honored to bring a storybook character or two to life for you and your families.

3. I was there for only about eight months, but I already have mined a few random shots of me with other families (thanks, Flickr!). I'll never know the grand total, but I'm sure it's a lot! I miss making that magic every single day. I'll never forget that, in the course of making dreams come true for families, my own life was a dream come true."
45,"Did you use any mods, and... wait, one sitting, 19 hours, holy hell, why?  And was it literally one sitting like no getting up to use the bathroom or eat/drink?   I hope if so you at least played on the toilet..."
46,Can you still have sex that isn't painful or uncomfortable?
47,"I am nude at home, at the nudist camp where I go, sometimes camping if I know nobody will be around, and at my nudist friend's house sometimes. "
48,"I think the war on drugs will eventually be recognized for the great failure it has been.  But not because of the most common reasons cited, nor reasons most obvious.  Some day the world will learn that the war on drugs was nothing more than a money-raising scheme to build prisons, then privatize the industry to make the rich richer.   Nothing changes.  Every venture of men's lives, literally, from birth to death, has been capitalized on by the greed of those in the most opportune positions to reap the benefits therefrom:  Abortion, Drug Addiction, Sex Addiction, Food Addiction, Materialistic Pursuits -- I could go on, forever.  "
49,"Some women use tampons. I wear underwear, a pad, and a cute skirt. It's pretty common. "
50,If you're a nudist and a mom does this mean your kids are also nudists?
51,Stance on evolution and climate change?
52,I'm very sorry to hear that.. Have the doctors discussed a more permanent surgery or anything to fix most or all of the problems?
53,"Yes, I still have full range of motion in both eyes when they are out. 

My optometrist is absolutely not a fan of it and won't allow me to show him because he is squeamish, but he did give me tips on what to do if things took a turn for the worse which I just answered in another reply."
54,Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Always know where your towel is.
55,Babies wear diapers still. It's pretty much the same as regular potty training. 
56,"I know /r/childfree keeps a list of doctors who will perform it on ""young"" people. If you really want to get it done, check their sidebar. "
57,"I know someone that got this allergy at about the same time he started treatment for Lyme Disease.  It was horrible.
Need to take an antibiotic but it only comes in a gel cap?  Well gelatin is made mostly from pigs.  Then insurance won't cover alternatives.

Going to Subway for lunch?  Well you have to kindly ask the ""sandwich artist"" to change their gloves before making your food because they've already touched red meat.

You'd be surprised how pervasive products from mammals are.  Although seafood and poultry can be eaten, you almost have to live your life like a militant vegan otherwise."
58,How was your day? 
59,"No, due to my lack of a uterus and ovaries."
60,Is the program effective?
61,People don't get a notification from post titles. /u/GallowBoob.
62,Are you a male or female?
63,"I'm twelfth grader.
I take science and math cources."
64,"Are you finding your transition back into society is easier or more difficult than you expected? 

What about your transition back into society have you found to be most surprising? "
65,"Halfway planned, i had the time to do it, and I've always kinda wanted to marathon a longer game"
66,How dangerous is frying bacon? Or do you just cook it in the oven?
67,"I was born blind in one eye, due to a bad retina.  

Do you have issues gauging depth in certain situations?  For example, oceans throw me, bc I can imagine the waves to be huuuuge and far off, or small and close.  Same with trees, they can be as big or as small as i imagine them.  

Is your blind eye lazy?  Mine is somewhat, but i had corrective surgery when i was very young (3?) And it helped.  

Are you *totally blind*?  Or can you tell light from dark?  I can sense light, but the vision is so poor my brain shut off the input, so i only notice I even have a left eye if i close my right one."
68,"The freedom, mostly. I would be constantly, but society doesn't allow it. "
69,"I need a time table, man. Can we get this done today or not?"
70,"Yes, I do have depth problems. I've never noticed it with wave about I've always struggled with ball sports and similar things at school because I can't tell how far away the ball is.

When I was younger I didn't have much of problem with something like football (I'm English so I guess soccer?) because the ball doesn't leave the ground, but as I got older and it started flying through the air I started being unable to play.

No it's not lazy. Ive been told by doctors I'm incredibly lucky as my blind eye just mimics my sighted eye, therefore it's almost completely unnoticeable. My friends actually have a hard time believing me, but it does start to drift when I get tired though.

When my blindness was discovered I could see colour shades and light and dark if I really focused, but over a year or two it totally stopped and now it's completely blind, I believe my optic nerve has actually stopped working.

(Sorry for the long reply, I guess I write too much lol)"
71,"Yes, I know how this sounds. It was not contacting my eyeball at all though,  i was pressing the eraser end against my eyelid, which was going behind my eyeball. It's hard to explain. I don't know why or how it started I just marveled at how far it went behind my eye. My friend, the one who saw it before even me, I was showing her how far the pencil went in. I imagine I looked insane."
72,"Do NKs actually believe the crazy ""facts"" about their dictator (he doesn't have BMs, bowls perfect games/best golfer in the world). "
73,"I carry my purse, which has a glasses cleaning cloth hooked to it. "
74,Because it was a question I was interested to get an answer for. 
75,Suck a dick and swallow FOR SURE. If I suck down the bottle of vodka I'm most likely going to end up sucking dick anyway. Might as well cut out the middle man.
76,"Yep. One guy's father was doing stuff in the black market and got tipped off that he was going to get a visit from the officials. He got all the money they had and bribed their way across the border into China. They weren't poor, so they could pay a driver to take them all the way to the SK embassy. "
77,"How do you feel about the privatization of the American prison system? Do you feel that your life was in some way sold through this system? What is your take overall on the war on drugs? Finally, what do you do/plan on doing from here out?"
78,Umm people don't pee with their vagina lol
79,"4-6 hours after ingestion, hives and anaphylaxis
"
80,"[These guys? Lol](http://www.bluemaize.net/im/toys/stress-reliever-toys-2.jpg)

I found out i could do it in 7th grade by absent-mindedly sticking a pencil behind my eye in class. my friend saw me and freaked out. I didn't even know it happened til she told me. So I took the pencil to the bathroom and did it in the mirror."
81,Stop trying to be different. Music is music it doesn't make you odd and no one cares.
82,"You should try this during sex. Right in the heat of the moment, just turn around and go ""REMEMBER ME EDDIE?!"""
83,"I'm not nude 100% of the time. Like with everything else, moderation is key and I am only nude when it's appropriate. 

I don't get stared at at home or at the camps because everyone else is nude as well. "
84,"I do agree that it's all about the money, but I have a question:

Why do you make it a black vs white thing when you're comparing different crimes. It's rather a crime vs crime discussion with the failed war on drugs. Right?

Studies has even shown blacks get harder sentences in drug cases

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/17/opinion/sunday/unequal-sentences-for-blacks-and-whites.html"
85,"My partner is also intersex, so we alternate. I typically use my vagina when having sex with her, then she gives me a handjob."
86,"There are only a few different ways out of NK, and most of them opt to go through China. If they have money, they can pay a broker to smuggle them either to a foreign embassy or to Laos and then into Thailand. 

Even if they're successful, the trip is traumatic. They are in constant danger of being caught by Chinese police and repatriated. One lady told me of riding in the trunk of a car with others for a few hours while the driver bribed the border guards. 

Those who can't afford brokers can easily be taken advantage of in China. One person I tutor will never give any details about a certain period of time right after she'd crossed the border. She skips over that part every time. I suspect she was either forced into the sex trade or had to resort to it to survive.

They fare better once they get to SK, of course, but they are still widely discriminated against when it comes to employment. Some of them have emotional disorders due to the trauma they experienced, and there just aren't systems in place to help them with that."
87,"How/when/why did you start? 

What questions do people stereotypically ask nudists, or maybe what judgments do people stereotypically make of you?"
88,chemistry
89,Send nudes
90,"Nothing like a little bigotry and arrogance to show how much smarter you are than an ""ignorant white American""."

94,"Any kind of mammalian meat with the exception of primates but that's not exactly an option lol. I can still eat poultry and sea food

95,To me that a pretty normal taste in music because i listen to about the same stuff. I just call it the rock/metal spectrum because it ranges from Alternative to Death Metal and everything that comes between. 
96,I moved to Vermont. Coincidentally. Might be the closest we get to the real thing. 
97,What happens if you eat a burger?
98,I use my hands to open my eyelids wide enough and use my eye muscles to push them out. To go back in I just relax the muscles and they slip back by themselves. It's a unique feeling 
99,"Option C man, honestly was two seconds away from killing Micheal though cause that is the fastest route and I had just watched the real life sunrise "
100,"Although it is unclear how many people are plagued with nudism in the US, it's a very sexualized condition that people are scared to address. What will really help is to bring awareness to the cause, so that others who are afflicted with it secretly can come out and not be afraid anymore. "
101,"$$$$$

His main profile is his resume. He can go to a company and say ""I deeply understand reddit and the reddit community. I can consistently get millions of eyes on my posts. If you want millions of eyes on your product, I'm the man who can do that for you.""

He doesn't shill under his main account. But I'm sure he shills like crazy on alts. "
102,"Yeah that's where I started this journey of sterilization. I'm in Alaska so no one up here, plus my husband is military so we have Tricare insurance which won't cover a hysterectomy unless you have uterine cancer. I have an out of network doctor lined up if the current one decides to not give me a hysterectomy, but that means paying entirely out of pocket which I would gladly do but like to avoid. Right now it's just jumping through hoops before I hopefully get it approved by the insurance. "
103,"Oh that's cool that you found someone else that's intersex. How'd you guys meet?

As far as orgasms go, which part do you prefer to ""cum""? Or which feels better??"
104,"My parents know because I called my mom on the camp phone and the caller ID gave me away (whoops!) 

I'm not private about it if someone asks me directly, but I don't announce it to everyone, either. My parents and few friends who know are cool with it, even if they think it's weird, but it's kind of fun to drop hints around the uninformed people and see how long it takes them to ask. "
105,"I think the fact that they have to compete for everything causes the most difficulty. For example, the NK government just gives you a job, and few people (10%?) even go to college. You just do the job that they give you. No interviews, no resumes, no competition at all. 

But here in SK they have to compete to get qualifications, then compete more against others' qualifications to get a job. Their favorite thing? That would vary according to the individual. One thing all the ones I've tutored have in common is that they use church on Sundays to help them regain a sense of community, which they lost upon leaving their homes. 

Help from the SK gov't includes adjustment education (mandatory), an apartment, a lump sum of money (the amount tends to change), a small monthly stipend, and free university tuition. Once they've graduated university, though, they're expected to make it on their own. They can keep the apartment after graduation, but the monthly stipend ends. 

They do pretty much all the same jobs as everyone else, but by far the most have to accept blue collar jobs. Some of the women even have to get into prostitution to survive. "
106,"I actually don't mess my diaper. I usually just pee in it. I have a very weak bladder, so that's primarily what the diaper is for. I can only imagine how disgusting poop in it would be. "

109,"Jimmy is either the greatest thing in the game, or the worst thing in the game and that scares me.  The scene with the bong and t-bagging is just awful and great at the same time. Lamar might beat him simply for singing 'niggaaaa' in the first mission."
110,Good question.
