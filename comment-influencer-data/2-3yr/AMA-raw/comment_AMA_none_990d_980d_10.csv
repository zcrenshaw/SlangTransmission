0,"(raises eyebrow). A Japanese man approached me on the street during occupation duty and told me ""Japan will rise again."" I replied back ""Good! We'll be back."""
1,"There is a distinguishing characteristic of those who have been in combat and those who have not. You have a different idea of the hazards of life in general. Instead of being shocked and surprised when someone close to you dies, you simply understand they are no longer there and you are glad they have been. "
2,Her parents disapprove of you. That's the entire conversation. 
3,"Been married for 18 years. My wife and in-laws still do this. It used to bother me and I found it offensive, especially since they can all speak English. Now I just enjoy being able to hangout in the other room watching TV without being bothered. Make the most of it."
4,"The genius of the Marines is training. In 1938, before Hitler invaded Poland, the Marines were a little bit larger in size than the PD of New York. They then went on to grow to 6 divisions, who knew what their job was and how to do it. That was the principal motivation every Marine had- he knew he could count on the buddy adjacent to him. and he knew what he knew how to do, and not wanting to let your buddy down."
5,"To bear in mind that we were given this country and its then-novel form of operation, and it needs the help of all citizens to continue. That does not mean solely what is done militarily for the country, but the things a good citizen can do to maintain and pass onto seceding gernations what we have been given. Good citizenship really entails a lot more than war-time heroism. It is what are the things each of us can do to make things run, in this our country. I guess it is possible to write a chapter on what is involved in good citizenship... local government, school board, church, scouts... even just good manners. Appreciating that we have that responsibility is how a country runs. "
6,How many courics was it?  
7,"No question.. From one Devil Dog to another, just a well deserved Semper Fi! "
8,"When we got to Japan at Tsapo- sp? (which is on a type of fjord). We went to land on mainland in order to determine if coast was clear. I didn't think ""why me? until the Col. said ""there will be no ammunition.

I had it explained to me that these were specific commands from central command (MacArthur) that no ammunition would be brought to main land for the initial landing party. The Colonel allowed me to have pistol ammo... we arrived in the LCPV, and I was wondering if any of the locals had lost relatives in the Pacific battles. 

There were various Japanese policemen saluting smartly, polished and on their best behavior. I sent out various patrols to look for surprises, and everything looked clean as far as we'd gone. Got next comm that we would be joined by rest of troops in the morning. 

We picked a building and stationed on the second floor... about midnight, the guys are beginning to shout ""there's one over here. I got em by the leg.""

Rats. Big ones. I call them fox terrier size. 

If our platoon had had ammunition, I really can't confidently say fire discipline was strong enough for a no fire order to be followed. you can imagine what impact that might have on the local population, and then perhaps the course of the war. 

MacArthur had never been a favorite of the Marines- he was perhaps adequate. But boy did he have a better handle on the Japanese response to occupation force arriving than we did. At that point, my respect for him really went up. Such a demonstration of a situation of how easily the first steps of the occupation could have gotten off to a bad start.  "
9,"I lived with an abusive and alcoholic father who did multiple things to cause it. One of the most vivid moments was when I was in 5th grade (so about 10 years old) he shot a dog that was in our yard in the chest, I heard the shot and came outside, the whinging and crying from the dog sounding like a person. As I stepped outside I saw the blood pouring out of its chest, the dog looking up at dad as he had the gun to its head and he pulled the trigger and the dogs brains came out the back of its head. He made me clean up the blood and drag the dog to the edge of the woods to bury it."
10,"A really good lesson I got was on the first day on Paris Island. There was a impression that cigarette butts on the ground would be deleterious to our health. I was told this, and ordered to make sure all these offending items were taken away.  A few feet behind me there was a loud voice saying ""Pick up that butt."" Being not too long out of college, and thinking I could express myself beautifully, I thought "" I was about to do that and you just slowed me down"". instead, I shut my mouth and said ""yes sir."" The drill instructor just smiled, and got across in about ten seconds- if you get an order, get it done. if you have a question, then ask. it's not a debating society, just get it done. "
11,"&gt; He's even met a couple clients

As a husband, I find it extremely difficult to stomach the thought of the one guy my wife dated before me. This one is beyond my personal level of comprehension. "
12,"Slam burger hands down. Its my favorite item period, regardless of my inebriation level
"
13,What's it like meeting an actress and taking advantage of their death 2 weeks later for fake internet points?
14,"What is, in your opinion, the best menu item to order when it is 2 AM and I'm inebriated?"
15,"(shakes head). I don't have anything I would characterize as that. Actually... I was lucky in the choise of what to do one day...

Napoleon (who knew about military affairs) was asked about the most important characteristic of officers. He wanted lucky ones. 

Probably the luckiest incident on Iwo was receiving fire from the side of cave on the side of the hill (behind camouflage and bushes)... hard to tell if there were snipers. I sent a guy off to get a bazooka who shot directly into the cave- disposing of the sniper. There was a puff or two of smoke, which didn't seem like much had happened. Then the top of the hill blew off. That was apparently a major ammunition dump for the Japanese garrison, and may have shortened the length of battle. 

I had no idea at the time about the ammunition depot. 
No particular valor or strategy. Just  trying to get rid of sniper. "
16,"Ooh, here's a cringe worthy story (that was my fault) from when I first started working!



A client named Ben messaged me asking me to meet him at a hotel. He wanted to meet me in the lobby and we would chat before heading to his room (oh gosh I would never do that today but anyway). I was so new I didn't even own a cell phone at that point so I called a cab, went to the hotel and sat down in the lobby scanning the room for ""Ben"". I made eye contact with a man and gave him a small smile and he came over and say next to me. 
""Ben?"" I asked. 
Slightly startled he smiled and said ""Why yes!""
We got to chatting and I gave him a coy look and said, ""So, do you do this often?""
He looked confused before answering, ""....ummm....talk to pretty girls?""
My face went beet red and I started stammering before he clued in and was all, ""Whoa, wrong Ben! Wait, can I be that Ben?""

I ran out of there, went home and checked my email again and realized I went to the wrong hotel! So not only did I embarrass myself I stood this poor guy up and he was PISSED. 

Sigh. I still cringe when I think about it."
17,I once met a girl in person that I'd only known online for 16 years. It's weird interacting with someone familiar in a new way. Very surreal. 
18,"I'm in Japan and I don't think we have a Slam burger hands down here. What is in it?

"
19,"The item is the Slam burger. The hands down was an expression sorry.  It is a regular burger with eggs, hash brown, bacon, pepperjack cheese sauce, and it comes with french fries on the side. It is very tasty"
20,What is the most insensitive question anyone has asked you?
21,"""Look at this asshole playing with his phone all night."""
22,Confirming this as fact from first hand experience. 
23,"When I was serving, to put it another way- our generation was faced with a situation where things were wrong and it was easy to identify who the bad guys were and what had to be done about it  We could see the people who had to do something about it were us that were serving and by extension- the rest of the population supported us. The veterans of more recent times have had more difficult service to accomplish with less clear reasons why they were doing it. And they weren't getting the support we had. 

In terms of personal feelings of support, our generations were well treated.

In terms of benefits, the help with mortgages, benefits, education etc, there have been more additional benefits made available over time. But certainly our generation had the feeling of support and understanding that today's veterans havent received. "
24,"I had one guy who told me he was a virgin. He was in his 30s, a doctor and had me lie down while he put on medical gloves. He would only touch me while wearing gloves. I licked his nipple and he came in his pants. 
He left very happy and still a virgin. "
25,I only made around $30 tonight :/
26,"[Japanese Denny's hamburg menu](http://www.dennys.jp/menu/hamburg/)

I'm guessing it's not like yours.

Note: They don't actually have hamburgers."
27,"I worked as a sex worker for a few months when I was 23/24 and retired. 
When I met my husband I was very upfront about what I used to do and he was fascinated by it. I was very unhappy with the job I had at the time and he suggested I tried sex work again as I enjoyed it and it paid so well. 

At first he had some difficulty with it (jealousy and whatnot) but over time he got over it. He's even met a couple clients and once he saw they were normal, nice dudes who treated me very well he is now very happy with what I do. 
"
28,"Anal sex is a hard no. Even hinting at wanting bareback sex will get you blacklisted and your information will be shared with every sex worker across the country. 

Enthusiastic yes? Making out, role playing, cuddling. 

Thank you so much for the kind words!!! I really appreciate your open minded attitude :)"
29,"Not only do they not have Slam burgers, they have nothing Denny's related."
30,"Not a question, but just wanted to say thank you for all that you do, even the exorcisms."
31,That's fucked up. 
32,"Red Beach 1 and 2 were the two beaches used by 5th Division. I was on the island a little uphill inland from Red Beach about 300 yards away from the base of the hill. 

What had happened the day before was really interesting- the cruiser Pasadena had been coming up close to Suribachi and firing at it- the embrasures were targets about 3 ft wide and 1 ft deep that the Japanese big guns were firing out of. When the Cruiser came up a few hundred yards away, they could fire directly at them. As the targets were all connected by tunnels, you could imagine what sort of impact that would have!

On the night of D+3, the rest of Japanese garrison wanted to retreat back, but the 28th Garrison just mowed them down. 

As they later told me, Dick Tuggle was the skipper of the Pasadena (an Annapolis graduate). Tuggle had received a message from Harry the Horse Liversedge (whose orders were to take Suribachi)- ""Dick I need help"" asking to help fire on the mountain. There was quite a protocol for how the Marines were supposed to enlist help from the Navy, but it absolutely precluded contact from old friends. Both Tuttle and Liversedge both bet their pension plans on nobody knowing about this. "
33,"then you should GO CATCH IT

"
34,"&gt; Wait, can I be that Ben?

My jaw dropped. This is priceless."
35,"Sorry- don't recall a John Douglas. I was Company B, Third Platoon"
36,Good evening sir. I was a corpsman with 1st Marine Division for 4 years and wanted to ask what's been the biggest thing you gained from the Marine Corps that helped you through the rest of your life? I get some pretty different answers from people and always am interested in hearing what people have to say. Thank you for your service and your time.
37,"Because there is too much prep work involved (enemas, etc). Also, I don't want to agree and then have the dude show up with a dick that resembles a tall boy. 

I find it's rarely a deal breaker with dudes and if it is, they are welcome to seek out someone else. "
38,lol
39,"My grandfather John Douglas was a part of Company B in the marines and stormed that same beach. A grenade fell in the Fox hole with him and a buddy, but on the buddies side. Buddy got blown up, and shrapnel got my grandfather's knee. He had that in his knee until he was 75. He stuck his head up and saw the dude who threw the grenade advancing on his position, so he killed him and then got out of the hole and off the beach. He stayed until the flag was raised on the mountain. He was in a history channel documentary called the boys of Company B. Any chance you knew him?"
40,"What are some of your personal hard ""no's"" and enthusiastic ""yes's""? 

I want to add, I admire sex workers (those who are doing it willingly/not for survival) for their confidence and work ethic. Sex work is certainly not as easy as people would like to believe, and there's so much horrible stigma around it all. As long you're doing it because you want to, and you're comfortable and safe, what's the big deal? I hope creeps keep away and you can keep making bank in the new year ☺"
41,"I always offer a shower before we move to the bedroom. If they decline, I smile and assure them it is for their benefit and walk them over myself. "
42,"Sex trafficking is very real and it unfortunately happens everywhere. 

There is a huge difference between those who do it willingly and those who are being trafficked. It is unfortunate that both get lumped into the same category. 

In Canada it is illegal to purchase sex, not sell it. So if a man hired a girl and could tell she was doing it against her will, he would be apprehensive to report it for fear of implicating himself. "
43,It's so great of you to project your insecurities on others
44,"You also failed at this AMA. At least you didn't fail at consistency.

Have an upvote "
45,99.9 courics. The record still stands.
46,"Can't blame her, she just slept with you. Probably the lowest point of her life. "
47,And John Wayne picked on me and a friend to help for advice on how to realistically portray Marines...
48,"What advice do you have for the many veterans, myself included, that just recently returned from conflict in the Middle East? Thanks in advance. "
49,"THE SOUTH WILL RAAS AGAIN!!!

It's only been 150 years. "
50,Wait...there is an Arby's in egypt? Whaaaaaaaat
51,I don't have any questions that haven't been answered. Just wanna say FUCK YEAH!
52,"That's a tricky one, I have a few.  But one that springs to mind was a couple of years ago I had a boy who could barely read when he came to my class and you could see how frustrated he was.  But by the end of the year he'd made so much progress that he was able to read his favorite book to the class, I was so proud that day I had to try so hard not to tear up."
53,"We did it once. He wanted to do it just so he could say ""I put it in your butt!""

It didn't really appeal to either of us. "
54,"I also once had a guy ask me to do an outcall to his place. 
The catch?
He lived at home and he wanted me to sneak in through his window around midnight after his mom went to bed. 

I declined that one. "
55,Let's just say I learned the hard way and my dodging skills are almost ninja quality.
56,"300 an hour. Where I live I am considered ""expensive"" as the going rate is usually $180 an hour. There are a couple girls in my city who charge 400 or 450 an hour but they tend not to be very busy. "
57,"The Japanese are an admirable people- warm and friendly. They have a military clique within them that I would call a complete bunch of bastards. In general, I have a high regard for the Japanese people, but the military type are sons of bitches. "
58,of course... send me your account numbers and passwords and I'll be sure and make a deposit for you ;)
59,"1) car upside down in a creek with people trapped inside.
2) woman who thought she was possessed and had me perform an exorcism in the back of the ambulance.
3) triple shooting because the family members were drunk and were arguing about who was better..Bear Bryant or Nick Saban"
60,Thank you very much my child. Now say three Hail Marys and take two Tylenol and call me in the morning. 
61,Jesus Christ man I'm so sorry. That is beyond fucked. Fuck your piece of shit dad.
62,So did you masturbate anyway?
63,"Wasn't expecting to find this here. I think this'll help my wife understand my reactions to what is devastating news to her. Thanks, for everything."
64,Dick Tuggle. Legendary name. 
65,Is your refrigerator running?
66,why not both?
67,"1.) she's hotter in her photos lol 

2.) No, not on the first time we hang out lol "
68,I actually teach music to kids so I tell them I do that full time
69,"Same thing happened to me (the pneumonia/unconscious for days part, not the huge dump).  When they took the breathing tube out, it felt like that scene in The Matrix where Neo wakes up in the goo.

**What kind of fever dreams did you have while you were under?**  It was pretty trippy for me.  I think I travelled into a painting next to my bed.  

I noticed that after I had my first real meal in a week (turkey and mashed potatoes) my bowel movement came quick and smelled exactly like the food I just ate.  **Did your second, post-coma BM smell like the food you just ate?**"
70,Is it true that the graphics are amazing??? 
71,"Being able to work as often or as little as I want and having the time to pick my daughter up from school every day. I can also stay home with her if she's sick and she doesn't have to grow up with parents who are stressed over money (like I was). 

Also it is very rewarding being able to provide a rewarding and intimate experience for people who are lacking intimacy in their lives. The clients I see are very appreciative of that. "
