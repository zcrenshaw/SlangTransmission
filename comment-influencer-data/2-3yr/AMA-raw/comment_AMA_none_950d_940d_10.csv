0,"I was actually killed in the Bowling Green Massacre, ask me anything you like."
1,I've always wanted to be able to answer an AMA...give me 10 minutes to find a victim
2,"Nice try, Officer"
3,"I am extremely opinionated, a little too logical, and I was addicted to THC- it's arguable that this is not possible, but I spent all the money I made on the sticky green, couldn't justify living without it, suffered from withdrawal symptoms, and showed zero control when consuming it. On top of this, I was at about 21% body fat- still what one would define as ""thin"" but not the defined, tight physique the successful girls around me sported. The biggest kicker was my hair, I liked to color it wild colors, and that does fly well in the traditional industry."
4,"I did a street BJ's scene and once filmed in the middle of a giant house party- yes, an actual party of 50+ random people, not paid actors- where the premiss was that I wanted to get it on with some hot shot, rap artist, but before I got to see him, I had to bump nasties with his friends first. It ended with some girls covered in fake blood in the middle of a giant pentagram, the other talent and I running away screaming for our dear lives. The best part was finishing the scene covered in an extreme amount of baby gravy, completely naked, wading through the crowed of confused party guests while asserting, ""I'm sticky and I need to shower."""
5,"&gt; am extremely opinionated, a little too logical, and I was addicted to THC

Something tells me it might have had something to do with your addiction more than the other 2"
6,16 + 25 = 41
7,"I used to go to college in Bowling Green, KY and the only Massacre that happened there was my grade point average every semester."
8,"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis ""the wise""?"
9,Steve Bannon actually still runs hell as a side job.
10,What's the reason you 'failed'? 
11,"Water. I have a weak stomach, and oral was always apart of the performance, so I kept my stomach empty so as not to hurl all over the male talent as he tested my gag reflex."
12,"She may have an addictive personality, so she wasn't chemically dependent."
13,"I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself."

15,Who runs Hell now that Trump is president?
16,Don't fall for the broken arms thing. 
17,"I've done this with my girlfriend as a one off thing - some guy across the country offered to pay to watch me fuck her, so we did.  She's been interested in taking it to the next level like you did, but she's worried about anonymity.  Has any of this ever come back to bite your ex?  Anyone she knows ever seen her?  My girlfriends about to start a full time job so this stuff matters to her more then it used to."
18,You are one kinky mother fucker aren't ya? Damn.

20,"Some male staff were extremely flirty with us girls which made me super uncomfortable. I had to be watched while I slept, showered, and went to a bathroom by an older man who seemed completely unprofessional and just creepy to me. I was not comfortable with that, but he was the only staff available and I had no choice in the matter. Most staff members were amazing. I hated most of them because they yelled at me and stopped me from doing things like hiding food, throwing up, etc. but looking back most of them were great.

Once I was having a really bad panic attack and a staff member screamed at me and told me to stop being overdramatic. A few people experienced some abuse while being restrained or getting tubes put in. That's all I can think of "
21,They know what causes that now.
22,Advantage boob hugs disadvantage can't reach things 
23,I have never been in an Ikea related argument.  Is that weird?  Why is fighting in Ikea even a thing?
24,This sounds like the best writing I've ever experienced.
25,"What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you rebel scum? I'll have you know I was the last Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, and I started the Clone Wars, and I have over 300 controlled solar sectors. I am trained in the Dark Side of the Force and I'm the top Sith in the entire Galactic Empire. Your planet is nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe it the fuck out with power the likes of which has never been seen before in this galaxy, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the holonet? Think again, Jedi. As we speak I am contacting my apprentice from across the galaxy and your rebel base is being traced right now so you better prepare for the 501st, Jedi scum. The 501st that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your rebel base. You're fucking dead, Jedi. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just without my lightsaber. Not only am I extensively trained in Dark Side combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the galactic imperial stormtroopers and I will use them to their full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the galaxy, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" destruction of my Death Star was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have retreated your fucking X wing. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn rebel. I will shoot lightning all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, Jedi.

26,"Fav snack while on ""set"" "
27,Who is Rusty and how long are his nails?
28,Why are you telling me this 
29,"Maybe go for something more realistic OP, like a Sasquatch, Amelia Earhart, or a sentient cabbage?"
30,Yea it's been quite an eventful day. The nail didn't stick in so it was just a wound. Doctor seemed mid twenties (my age) and had to look my b-hole in the eye so we're both probably having a rough day. They put me on antibiotics and gave me a tetanus and that's it
31,"I don't have any desire to have sex, or masturbate, on camera anymore, but I do like being naked and showing off my body. I plan on posting to r/gonewild or other like communities when I get the motivation, as well as plan to live stream in the nude, but all in good time. I am enrolling in college and plan on getting a degree, not sure what for yet, but I love to learn. Maybe I'll make a naked book club- combine my favorite of two things."
32,"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis ""the wise""?
"
33,"I've always been very bad at it. I don't learn until someone humiliates me either, so please, feel free to tear my spelling to shreds. Maybe you'll be the one to finally break the cycle. "
34,"You are completely correct, but the first two things also have a lot to do with it. I was a double standard, is what I'm trying to get at. My personality wasn't that easily manipulable into something that could shine in adult entertainment, but I smoked so much that no one could take me seriously as an intellectual. So I was just a stubborn, blazed little girl... not the best representation of yourself when you're trying to make a career.  "
35,"I think you hit the nail on the head here. It definitely wasn't the THC's fault- everyone around me could handle their shit, I'm just notorious for holding on too tight."
36,Did your veggiemite melt? 
37,"I like it, it brings light to the disability in a humorous way normally "
38,If only you had a different username...
39,"No. Google is a search engine, and the 'dark web' is a hidden network on the internet. There are Google like tools to search it though.

There's no joining to it, it's like saying you joined the internet. It's not an exclusive club lol, anyone can do it with the right tools. I started using it for shits and giggles mostly, but it's useful to stay anonymous.

Feel free to ask anything else :)"
40,"I ran away because of a lifetime of abuse from my bio mother and stepfather, and I finally cracked under it. I definitely don't regret it, and even though life is definitely harder (especially making ends meet), I've honestly never felt more at peace."
41,How can I get your job?
42,We ALL survived Bowling Green on this blessed day.
43,"[This guy] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjyyfmqQazw&amp;index=91&amp;list=PL_NnG4jzzKohor2G8liXfgfRboMRGtO-f) has 80+ videos in this series where he discusses the dark web, how to protect yourself while surfing, and browses the dark web extensively. "
44,Does it come out hard or has it cooked inside you before it comes out? 
45,ARE WE GETTING THE SLURGENDUGEN OR THE HOFFENFLEISOR??!!  I WISH I NEVER MARRIED YOU.
46,4'6 which is very tall for a dwarf you could say I'm lucky.
47,"&gt; Simpson was found guilty in 2008 in a Nevada robbery and kidnapping case and was sentenced to 33 years in prison. He is eligible for parole in October 2017.

Doesn't mean he's getting parole."
48,"Oh! Oh! I know somebody that can use a good murdering!!!! If I'm not too late. 

EDIT: added the last sentence. Wanted to make sure that I wasn't too late. "
49,"In general mental health inpatient not very much because there were a lot of very unstable people there - a lot of schizophrenic people who talked to or screamed about things I couldn't see. But once I got to the eating disorder units, I had 4 different roommates throughout my stay, 3 of whom I now consider some of my closest friends. And I still talk to most of the people I was with in both eating disorder inpatient and residential. We have meals together, go to therapy groups together, and live together so they basically became like family! "
50,Bad people don't make bad children. I made a choice to be better. Thank you
51,We had a child... So the porn stopped and we stopped loving each other. We're still good friends now and she still shares any money that comes in from any videos we sell. Which we still do.
52,"I think the reason is the structured way they make you walk through the store combined with other people getting in your way make it so that it takes too long to get what you need. I have noticed about 3/4 of the way through the smaller items on the lower level, past the dishes and lamps near where the pillows and rugs are, people are almost always arguing with one another at this point. "
53,"I don't come from a big family. But I have cousins that come from a family with 17 kids.  All the same parents. Some of the kids have Nieces and Nephews who are older then they are as aunts and uncles. 

Another family in our extended family has 11 kids,  and another has 8 or 9.

Yes, they are all Mormons."
54,He does a hell of a job
55,"No, I'm under 18 so I was made to go by family. I was suicidal and ended up in the ER, where they sent me straight to general mental health until I was stable and could go to the eating disorder unit "
56,"I didn't think through much before I did anything while filming, I was mostly just afraid of being in any pain, so I avoided potentially painful things like anal, BDSM and humiliation. I have done ""Daddy-daughter"" scenes now that I could never see myself doing again, and don't understand how I justified it at the time, but they were my best selling scenes, so I must have done them well."
57,"Having MRKH doesn't affect when or how someone get aroused, nor does it change the feeling of being aroused. I feel the same as everyone else does when they are in a sexual situation. The only difference is not being able to have vaginal stimulation without treatment, but I find clitoral stimulation is fine for me now. "
58,"Be safe.  Practice self care. 

You're going to be fine.  You have value. "
59,"Have you ever tried any hallucinogenic drugs? If so, what was your experience like?"
60,If you're always high are you really ever high?
61,shouldn't this be an AUA (ask us anything)?
62,"^ this, everyone talks like it's some top secret fan club. It's literally just a different part of the internet that requires some extra steps to use. "
63,"Did you go voluntarily? If so, when and how did you realize you should go to a mental health facility? If not, how did you get there? "
64,"Um, I dont think you can get physically addicted to THC can you? Always thought it was mental...I smoked like a chimney from age 14-23, got in trouble, had to quit cold turkey and it was not hard at all."
65,r/theydidthemath
66,I once survived a massive headache while bowling in a green shirt. Does that count?
67,"Nah, I think it's more likely I'm just a really fuckable daughter. "
68,"Did you have any scenes that attempted to have a plot? If so, what was the cheesiest?"
69,"Here's a friend and I with a person we accidentally [killed](http://img.cinemablend.com/cb/a/5/2/8/5/b/a5285baf72ec4660e26ae70b5f6cc1598f964c57fa11e7b3638e69b29c525556.jpg)

70,Where can I purchase these films?
71,Sex work is one of the oldest professions still regularly practiced today.
72,OJ gets out this year
73,"I'm torn between ""that's hot"" and ""I hope not."" :("
74,"Yeah it happens. 
Not long ago something got posted with her real name next to it.
MFC are super quick at taking these things down though, even when you haven't been on for a while."
