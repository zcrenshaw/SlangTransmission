1,"My condolences. Are you sure that this AMA is what you need to be doing? You still might be in shock, and no one here would want you to put out information you might later regret."
2,"I'm hallucinating, not like scooby doo but weird colors. You're right.

Goodnight sir"
3,Around the 5 day mark is when you start to hallucinate and start to see permanent mental damage. Please go to sleep.
4,"I already had a lot of mental health struggles. I've dealt with severe anxiety since early childhood. Needless to say, it all got a lot worse. I stopped going to school all together until we moved that summer. At my new school, I completely refused to make friends. I decided it would be better to be alone that hurt somebody else like that. I literally quit all the stuff I liked doing and sat alone. I was super anti bullying, but had no friends myself. Eventually, I got to know a girl who also had no friends, but our relationship was pretty rocky. Slowly, I started getting to know people better, but it wasn't until a few years later (I was 16) when I ended up in the hospital from a suicide attempt; that I came to terms with the fact that yeah, it happened. It happened and it was fucking terrible and I have to live with that. But I'm not the only one to blame. It doesn't excuse my actions at all, but I wasn't alone in it. The entire school was involved. They all made fun of him ruthlessly, and used what I did as an excuse. No one person was the cause of what happened, it was a group effort from my peers. Not one person stood up for him. Not even the teachers (and they knew what was happening) If I hadn't done what I did, maybe he would still be alive, maybe he wouldn't. When I turned 17, his mom found me on facebook. She sent mr a super long message about how she knew what happened, and didn't blame me. Apparently, he didn't either. Eventually, she convinced me to meet her for lunch. She still had his suicide note where he explained what happened; how he knew I was hurting too, and couldn't blame me because he would have done the same. About a year later, a girl I went to middle school with messaged me. One of the girls who I was 'friends' with had died from a drug OD, another killed herself. I guess we all felt guilty. "
5,"Well, an ama for my biggest life regret that causes crippling guilt. 

Long story short, I was in middle school (grade 8, so 13 years old) and has been severely bullied for most of my life. Some girls made friends with me. They weren't good people but I was 13 and alone so I went with it. There was a boy everybody picked on, and my friends told me that I should tell him I liked him. I did what they said. Shit went from bad to worse and the girls were ruthless. Made a point of making fun of him in front of the entire school. He killed himself that night. 

So, what do you want to know?

Edit: I'm 18 now, so its been five years. "
6,It took you that long to do a 16 page paper? Time for a new direction 
7,Would you rather fight one 19 year old New Yorker or nineteen 1 year old New Yorkers?
8,In hell
9,Why does your island want to kill you?
10,.....because it's an AMA maybe
11,I guess he went to bed.
12,Pops was heading home after work on his motorcycle cruiser. Some asshole in the oncoming lane was on his phone and drifted into his lane killing him on impact. 
13,"-  Quit any games that you go to constantly. 'Grind' games are the worst culprits, but any game might qualify. You might feel a sense of void in your life, like you took the ground out from beneath your feet, but it's worth it. No pretend quitting.

-  Organize yourself. Clean your room. Clean your car. Clean anything and everything in your life that is messy. And most importantly, keep your work organized. Find methods of organization that work. Simple is usually better. One calendar may be more manageable than having multiple. More tiers of organization can end up being clutter.

-  Organize your time with a tick list. Make boxes that you can check off. Make the list when you sit down to do your work. Be realistic, but don't be unambitious either. Break down tasks. Don't just have ""Study ____"". Don't just have ""Complete chapter _____"". Have specific tick boxes, and then sub-tick boxes. Don't make specific lists an hour before you do them, make them as you've already sat down to get work done. You can have a general to-do list the night before (calendar or planner), but your specific list is made when you sit down. Keep breaking tasks down until they feel manageable. I put tabs on every 10 pages in the chapter I'm reading, so I know where I'm at. I keep tick boxes of sub goals like reading the chapter, completing certain practice questions, etc. 

-  Change your space. Organization is the key, remember. If your current space is cluttered, you'll feel cluttered even in a new uncluttered space. Unclutter your life, and make sure your work space is not your relaxation space. Organization in physical things translates into organization of goals and completion of those goals.

- If something is really wrong, see the doctor. If you have attention deficit, see the doctor. Laziness is something different, good self reflection is important. Drugs won't get you from 0 to 100 though, they may just help break down one barrier, but you may have more. Take one bar out from a jail cell and you might still be stuck.

-  Decide if what you're doing is what you want. I wanted to have money and have a 9-5 job with a 6-figure salary. So what did I do? I completed university. How did I do that? I completed courses. How did I do that? I completed projects. But what did I **get out of it**. I built up some skills, and in the end I've got better reading/writing skills, more life experience, and a degree. That's not a lot, that's not enough for the time spent. Most of that is all empty and hollow stuff. Unsustainable. Won't get me to a 6-figure salary, won't get me job security or satisfaction. But what will? The epiphany is that how hard you work now, right now, determines how far you will go. You can change how far you go with the flip of a switch. It's like a fat person deciding to eat well tomorrow... it's all about now, not tomorrow. If you do well for yourself now, and always do well for yourself now, then the future will look good. Now is your future. Now, now, now. Make sure whatever you are studying for is what you want. And if it is, retain what you study. Study to know, study to learn, study to be better at whatever you want to become. The test NEEDS to be secondary. The test is an immediate goal, but your every-day now goal should be to retain the information you're studying so that YOU can be an expert in what you are studying.

-  In summary... I looked past the simple, tried-and-true stuff. I thought organization was dumb and I just needed to stop being lazy. I thought self control meant being able to play games and still succeed (so I thought I should keep games in my life). Don't discount the most basic, most important things that will build success in your life. Organization of notes, organization of living space, organization of thought, organization of priorities. Cut out the slack, if it's a problem get it out of the way for good, there's no grey area to operate in. Think black and white. Yes or no. Keep or throw out. ""Will power"" and ""balance"" can come later, way later, when you consider yourself functional. And finally, your goals are always right now.

Might not help everyone. Might sound a little too simple. Again, 27 years went by and I never really *got* organization, I never really gave up games, it was too simple but also really difficult."
14,Can i send you pictures of Richard Nixon and ask you to rate them?
15,I can't hurt babies so I'd have to go with fighting a singular 19 year old. 
16,"Both. My mother is a master gaslighter. She would convince me that conversations I remembered never happened, that I was delusional. She would tell me one thing (I.e. I'm so brave and strong, she's protecting me from anyone who doesn't believe me) but secretly do the opposite behind my back (told everyone I was a drug addict while forcing me to take a drug test on the toilet in front of her to ""prove"" to everyone I was clean). 

The physical abuse ranged from the occasional push down the stairs or slap across the face to less typical abusive behavior like hiding pills in my food, locking me in my room (as an adult), literally tying me up with a bungee cord and forcing me to go the ER when I refused. The biggest part of the physical abuse was also emotional and psychological. She convinced me that I was abnormally sick, took me to tons of specialists (22 doctors in 2 years at one point), all while doctor-hopping to keep me on a particular medication that MADE me abnormally sick. I eventually lost 60lbs, broke my pelvis due to osteoporosis, had bruises covering my whole body and very nearly died or killed myself too many times to count. She used psychological abuse to keep me on the medicine but the results were physical."
17,"It was pretty gradual. For a year before I cut ties, I had started seeing a new doctor. She was very concerned that the prednisone was causing all my very significant physical symptoms so I stopped taking it ( sounds simple, in reality, with asthma and an extensive pneumonia history, not so much). As I got healthier, I paid more attention to the bad behavior, noticed the lies and tried to distance myself. I still believed my mother wanted the best for me but I saw her as incredibly damaged. 

My attempts at freedom pushed my mother over the edge. Demonstrably lying in court, breaking into my condo's mailbox to leave unpostmarked ""gifts"" for my daughter, calling a repeatedly leaving ""blank"" voicemails that ""overhear"" her playing with her dog (i still love that dog). I thank God for this. If she hadn't gone so far over the line, I don't know if I ever would have realized how destructive she was. I wanted to love my mom and have her love me. I thought taking the abuse and still loving her made me a good daughter. I am eternally grateful she finally pushed me past the point of no return."
18,Not yet. I think they said that will happen in a few days.
19,It is. 
20,Goodnight sweet prince
21,I have nothing better to do. And this keeps me busy. Thinking about my dad brings back all the good memory's 
22,"Lol! It's actually therapeutic! It can be very hard to talk to people I know about this directly. And those I can be direct and detailed with, well, it can get tiring. Telling strangers in excruciating detail is cleansing.

EDIT: Thank you for the gold! My first!!"
23,I don't really know lol. Guess nature just hates us.
24,"The gaslighting. I believed what she told me because who would ever assume their mother would want to hurt them. Why would a mother spend all her free time trying to get me healthy if she really wanted me sick? 

I believed I was severely mentally ill (aggression and psychosis are common side effects of the overprescription of steroids, prednisone in particular) and could not trust my own memories. I complained to the psychiatrists frequently that I had memory problems. 

She had an answer for every bad behavior too. She put pills in my food because she ""knew I had a hard time keeping it down"" and she thought it would be funny. She tied me up because I wouldn't ""accept help"" anymore because I was so despondent over not getting healthy. She locked me in my room because I was so mentally unstable I was a threat to her.

A year ago, she assaulted me and barricaded me in a room in front of my daughter. When I left her house, she tried to section 12 me twice in 24 hours, called DCF to attempt to remove my daughter, filed a false report that I stole her jewelery, and teamed up with my daughter's bio-dad to take full custody away from me. She went so far and lied so much that I finally could see her as the abusive woman she was, instead of blaming myself because I thought I was crazy."
25,"I went off to college 8 hours away from home, and that's where my addiction spiraled out of control. I was 19 and supposed to be having the time of my life. Instead, I was a drug addict who was strung out all day. I was on the verge of killing myself, I had ruined all my friendships, relationships, trust, everything went to shit. And it made me run towards my drugs even more. In other words, I hit rock bottom. The best way I can describe heroin addiction is putting off everything you need to get done until tomorrow. Except nothing will ever get done. I realized that if I don't want better for myself, then why should anybody want better for me? While in outpatient treatment, my counselor told me that sometimes you need to hit rock bottom in order to have a solid foundation to build yourself back up upon, and I believe there's truth to that."
26,Heroin is my shit. 
27,"Just a secret society of cool dudes looking for other cool dudes who wanna hang out in their party mansion. Nothing sexual. Fitness encouraged. If you’re fat, you should be able to find humor in the little things. Again, nothing sexual."
28,"Damn girl.  Be careful with that shit. 

I guess I'm a hippie. 

"
29,Can you shoot strings out of your hands?
30,"Back when we first started dating, I was always very hesitant to take off my pants when things started getting frisky. It got to the point where I would just pay attention to her without asking for her to reciprocate, and eventually I suppose she started to notice and asked me what was up.

When I told her, she was really nice about it and told me the whole ""it's not the size of the boat that counts"" thing, which was a huge relief to hear and helped me work up the courage to finally get naked with her. The first time she saw it, we didn't have sex. We just kinda chilled in her room, both in the buff, watching Westworld. I remember she called it ""pretty looking"" which was like an instant boost in confidence. And since then, I've gradually become more and more happy with myself. I feel super lucky to have met her. "
31,Or died
32,Will there be a sequel where you go to Hell and kill the spider again?
33,"What's your drug of choice? 

How about that LSD am I right? "
34,8.5 
35,fag
36,"Good move. You'd probably end up ~~chained to a pipe in some guys basement~~ falling in love, getting married, and living happily ever after;)"
37,Didn't say you haven't 
38,Do you and your group if friends rarely go to work and sit at a coffee shop all afternoon?
39,"Jesus, I'm so sorry OP."
40,Give the guy a break he's been bitten by a fucking poisonous spider
41,"Thanks for the AMA. I've had more than a few friends and a acquaintances from my hometown pass away from heroin so it is always great to hear a situation where someone gets clean. Congrats and please keep it up.

I had to have a really hard conversation with a buddy from high school that got into it after we graduated. I tried to have some encouraging words to help get him clean and offered any type of help I could. A few weeks later he was found dead in his room and I took it really hard because I felt like I should of done more. My question is, if I ever find myself in that situation again, do you have any advice on how I can help a friend in need that is struggling with a heroin addiction?"
42,"You're only 17 though, don't try and hold all of their worries on your shoulders. "
43,Sleep tight pupper
44,"Wow. This is hard to read. Good for you for accepting that it wasn't only your fault though, what you said makes complete sense, it sounds like a lot of people contributed to it. The most you can do about it now is use this to change your actions in the future which it sounds like you've done.

The fact his mom met up with you for lunch is really interesting, must've been hard on you both. As depressing as it may have been I'm assuming reading his note addressing that it wasn't your fault and that he understood why you did what you did really helped you. It was nice of her to show that to you."
45,Was the spider wearing a tank top and aviator sunglasses?
46,"I'm a medical student rotating through psychiatry and am consistently in awe at the tolerance and compassion the floor nurses exhibit despite the profound hardships of working with the mentally ill. You guys are awesome! I don't have any questions, but just wanted to say thanks :)"
47,Thanks man. I really appreciate it. I'm pretty new to the reddit scene and I'm supprised I haven't had anyone call me a faggot yet 
48,Yeah
49,"She had an unknown person in her house that refused to leaves, I'd call the police too."
50,What is this- the sitcom Friends? 
51,My wife has slept naked for the first time the last two nights. . . I am a happy man. 
52,"Surgeon. 
Thank you for your service to the world. Really."
53,Yeah
54,How painful was/is it 1-10?
55,Pathetic.
56,So its like grindr for older rich white folk
57,What tool did you leave behind?
58,She had an unknown person in her husband that refused to leave.
59,"I live in New York, I don't like it that much. I find it too expensive and it's too cold most of the time. I plan on moving to Florida soon, I was looking into Hawaii but it's waaay to much money."
60,Do you think it's fair your parents got in illegally and you benefitted from it while Mexicans who tried to come in legally in your position would be turned down?
61,I have some sad news...EVERYBODY hates people that vape. 
62,Yeah. Moved to an entirely different city actually. 
63,"Aircraft performance point of view?...no. Luckily I think I lost it inside the cabin, the bad side is that a passenger could potentially have it, and I don't want to imagine the worst."
64,"Interesting AMA, but there are no bullies in Reddit..."
65,We are the worlds largest island and smallest continent
66,"I would steal from my parents, sell my stuff. I started to run out of stuff to steal or sell and wasn't willing to sell my body. So I started a part time job at 16. After I got a part time job, that's primarily how I payed for my drugs. Sometimes it wasn't enough and I'd have to steal petty things. My parents often would ask where my money was going to, and I would tell them into a savings account or towards a car or college. Something like that."
67,Yeah easily the worst pin I've ever experienced
68,"Is your name Harley Quinzel by any chance? 

Serious question: what difficulties do you face in your job? "
69,"Thank you so much. 
I have a younger sister and brother. Like the rest of my giant Irish Catholic family, they don't speak to me. I could be very difficult to deal with and they believe my mother.

I don't have any interactions with my mother outside of the court cases now. She still ""butt-dials"" me and leaves messages, and I'm nervous about what will happen after custody hearings this week, but I can't allow someone who abused me with no remorse to be anywhere near me.

And my mother and my father divorced when I was 21. He confirms my story and says it was a major reason they divorced. He believed the prednisone was ruining my health but my mother is incredibly controlling and wouldn't listen. He can confirm some stories and adds more. My mother has a bachelors in psychology, masters in counseling and a doctorate in education. She is a dangerous and convincing woman, so my father (and me) doubted himself, especially since everyone thought she was incredible."
70,"I knew an actor who appeared in a local car dealer's commercial as an ""actual customer"" delivering a glowing review.

She doesn't even drive."
71,How far can you throw a PS4 controller? Please respond in meters.
72,"From the time I've spent on Reddit, people are usually very respectful. "
73,It's okay. Life's short. I'm more worried about how my family is taking it 
74,The chances of a passenger finding it that actually wants to hurt people is very very very small. 
75,Venomous
76,"I used the rest of what I had, and then quit. Essentially, it was cold turkey. I did outpatient treatment. I didn't want to go into detox, because I have my own reasons for not being a fan of it. My withdrawls were awful, I lost weight, I stopped menstruating for months, it wasn't fun at all. For me, the first 3 days were the hardest."
77,Does drunk in cornfield count?
78,"I don't think you'll get lots of responses with these phrasing. Consider something a bit less judging. ""Someone who participated in the bullying of someone who killed themselves""

Most suicides have more than one cause, and not many people would want to identify as ""the cause""."
79,Pic?
80,"Not at all man! I'm around 4 inches in length.

I used to be worried there'd be problems but honestly it's not that bad at all. Sure, there are some positions where a bigger penis would definitely help, but there are also [certain positions](http://au.askmen.com/dating/love_tip_200/209_love_tip.html) that work great if you're below average. It's a cliche, but the notion that it's not the size that counts, it's how you use it, is true. And I've found trying out different things and experimenting is part of the fun :) It also helps if you like to use toys. They can also be fun. 

The main ""problem"" that comes with having a small penis is not a physical problem, it's a mental one. You've got to try to get over that feeling of inadequacy and realise you're totally capable and totally deserve to be as happy as anyone else. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't happen overnight. I still struggle from time to time. But you'll get there! "
81,Are you a straight male? Or purely gay for profit?
82,I deserve that one
