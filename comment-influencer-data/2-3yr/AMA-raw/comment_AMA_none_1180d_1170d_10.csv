1,I'm somewhere between miffed and murderous right now
2,"I'm a Scot too and totally fucking shocked this actually happened. It's like the trump thing. All a bit of banter till it actually becomes real. 

I would love another referendum and that we vote ourselves independent. Even better if we got back into the EU as an independent country and leave England and Wales to get fucked basically. "
3,"Me llamo t-bone, la araña discoteca."
4,"Well I'm sure he wouldn't give me a fucking high five and skip along his way.  But like I said before, he would want me to be happy and treated well.  Your asinine comment wasn't really necessary.  "
5,"&gt; The only times the killing is allowed is in Defense when the sword is raised against not only Muslims but any faith to prevent them from practicing faith.

Seriously, what Quran are you reading?  Because I've read it.  And it states outright, repeatedly, to ""smite them at the neck"" for being non-believers, or for being friends of non-believers.  This entire AMA is a lie.


[Where's the part here where it says it only applies to people who are attacking you?](http://www.clearquran.com/004.html)  

&gt; ***So fight in the cause of God; you are responsible only for yourself.*** And rouse the believers. ***Perhaps God will restrain the might of those who disbelieve.*** God is Stronger in Might, and More Punishing.

&gt; 85 Whoever intercedes for a good cause has a share in it, and whoever intercedes for an evil cause shares in its burdens. God keeps watch over everything.

&gt; 86 When you are greeted with a greeting, respond with a better greeting, or return it. God keeps count of everything.

&gt; 87 God-there is no god except He. He will gather you to the Day of Resurrection, in which there is no doubt. And who speaks more truly than God?

&gt; 88 What is the matter with you, divided into two factions regarding the hypocrites, when God Himself has overwhelmed them on account of what they did? Do you want to guide those whom God has led astray? Whomever God leads astray-you will never find for him a way.

&gt; 89 They would love to see you disbelieve, just as they disbelieve, so you would become equal. So ***do not befriend any of them***, unless they emigrate in the way of God. ***If they turn away, seize them and execute them wherever you may find them***; and do not take from among them allies or supporters.

So IF THEY TURN AWAY kill them?  Does that sound like self defense?  

&gt; 104 And do not falter ***in the pursuit of the enemy***. If you are aching, they are aching as you are aching, but you expect from God what they cannot expect. God is Knowledgeable and Wise..  

What part of ""pursuing"" is ""self defense?""  

[Maybe in book 8 it talks about self defense?](http://www.clearquran.com/008.html)

&gt; 12 Your Lord inspired the angels: ""I am with you, so support those who believe. I will cast terror into the hearts of ***those who disbelieve***. So ***strike above the necks, and strike off every fingertip of theirs***."" 

Sorry, you don't get to pretend that the interpretation of this is ""just in self defense"" any more than I get to pretend that a claymore mine that says ""Front, Towards Enemy"" really should be interpreted as ""Don't use this to harm people.""  

&gt; 39  Fight them until there is no more persecution, and religion becomes exclusively for God. But if they desist-God is Seeing of what they do.  

Here, even this translation is trying to alter the meaning of the texts.  The original word was ""fitna"" which means ""disbelief"" not ""persecution"".  Which makes more sense as to why they continue to state that you should fight until ""religion becomes exclusively for God"".  

&gt; 67 It is not for a prophet to take prisoners before he has subdued the land.  

[Again, the original texts are here](http://quran.com/8/67)

The texts do not say ""subdued the land"".  What is literally said here is ""Take no prisoners, massacre everyone in the land.""  

[Maybe we should move on to book 9?](http://www.clearquran.com/009.html)

&gt; 5 When the Sacred Months have passed, ***kill the polytheists wherever you find them***. And capture them, and ***besiege them***, and ***lie in wait for them at every ambush***. But if they repent, and perform the prayers, and pay the alms, then let them go their way. God is Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.  

Once again, murder anyone that isn't Islam, unless, of course, they convert and pay a fine.  And what part of FINDING non believers, and AMBUSHING, and BESIEGING them has to do with SELF DEFENSE?

You're a liar.  Full stop.  And I've only barely even started with the book.  There's no point in continuing though.  Your whole book is an evil, evil religion, which is why it's responsible for almost 100% of terroristic activity.  Pretending it's something that it isn't will solve nothing.

6,"Your ramblings aren't making your point.  As for one who has ""educated myself with blogs"" I think my year and a half spent in Cairo Egypt, and reading the Koran cover to cover multiple times, interpreting it from the original Arabic, etc. probably qualifies me far more than most ""muslims"" to know what's in it.  I know for a cold fact that the vast majority of Muslims don't read their own Koran any more than the vast majority of Christians read their own bible.  

Keep spreading your lies, but I'll do what I can to stop you from spreading your filth.

So while we're on the subject, how do you justify Muhammad forcibly taking his ""favorite"" wife from her parents when she was 6, and then fucking her when she was 9?   

Or how do you come to grips with the fact that he ultimately died from the poison that was put in his food by a woman he took as a sex slave after murdering her husband?  

Care to talk about the real shit that's in your fucked up book?"
7,"Not on my scale it isn't. I'm quick to get stabby.
In the Scottish independence referendum? At the time I really thought so. Slightly less in the weeks after. Now? I guess it was still the right choice -- I never expected this"
8,"Alright buddy lets break this down!!

&gt;Lady, 

Your first word comes off condescending. This is a place for casual amas. Interesting life styles that, most of us, are curious about hearing their point of view.

Next up, your whole comment came across as an interrogation. We are here to ask questions. Not demand them. Your ego and aggression shows in almost every line.

Hitting the final point, you miss roughly half the grammar that anyone would use in common conversation. Common decency supercedes your lack of manners and your opinions on ""how she should answer you.""

Tl;dr: Be nice, act like an adult, and dont act oblivious. You know what you did."
9,Ew. Why are you so aggressive? 
10,"Search ""virgin wins date with porn star xhamster"", grab your popcorn, and cringe away."
11,"On a scale of 1 to ready for murder and to hell with the consequences, how pissed off are you with the rest of the UK right now?"
12,"Are you aware that this is actually [commanded in the bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levirate_marriage)?

"
13,Population is high and country land is small.
14,"&gt; Oh well you're probably not interested since i'm a girl

You must be new here on reddit, welcome.
"
15,Was it hard for you to learn to count to ten?
16,"i had sex with stoya when i met her through my roommate at the time who was beginning to dabble in porn. it was fun, she's really intelligent. we hung out a few other times but it was never physical again. "
17,Let's do it. Maybe learn from Sealand and start our own country on an oil rig somewhere
18,no i have my girlfriend for that.
19,Does your mom count?
20,"LOL the same happened to me.  Never ever interview for a job you don't know the full details about prior to showing up! It's either something like this, a shady recruitment practice, or someone who's going to butt-rape you. "
21,The morgue. 
22,Nothing from that long ago is relevant 
23,You stepped in and became their mum? You're fucking awesome. Seriously.
24,Have you ever accidentally masturbated to younger pictures of your mom?
25,Is that even a question ? When is maple syrup not a factor?
26,"I had no idea that we said it differently than anyone else. I'm going to assume we pronounce it properly, and you pronounce it as 'burgulahhhhh alahmmmm'
"
27,Someones having a rough day...
28,correct
29,"It's 10 minutes from my house figured why not go. Apparently I was ""referred"" to them. Just got out of the interview, ended up getting into an argument with the guy."
30,It's a wonderful feeling. I look forward to a future spent burning in hell. What does it feel like knowing that you're an ass? 
31,[deleted]
32,"I am not spending so much money actually i have too much money, "
33,The right part of my body is affected. Luckily the center is intact.
34,"Yes, it was weird for both of us at first and we never intended on doing it again...but then it kept happening again... &amp; again."
35,"A good % of pornstars are available for private hire, so it shouldn't be that hard.

I almost hired Ava Devine (it was a phase) a few years ago but dates didn't match up "
36,"I answered in more length below but the main three arguments were: How this is definitely a pyramid scheme, how the whole thing is kind of a scam, and him using stupid phrases like ""Opportunity"" rather than ""job"" and interrupting to correct me whenever I said ""job"""
37,As an English person who is apparently surrounded by traitorous leave voters. Would you fancy pooling our funds together and buggering off to scandinavia somewhere?
38,It was aggressive and you know it. 
39,They're all dead
40,Wow. Great Moves. Keep it up. Proud of you.
41,"Haha. It's not That great of a story unfortunately.  But I was working downtown Toronto and this guy used to call me up most nights. He lived in a nice apartment, good looking guy. Most people like that just called me late after they went to the bar, he definitely wouldn't have a problem getting a girl home but some people just really like getting escorts I guess. He was a really nice guy. Probably would be into him if we met on other terms, but it was so big I was almost in tears when we had sex. He wasn't rough or anything but I literally had to make him my very last call of every night (more like early morning) because when I left his place I was too sore to go see anyone else."
42,"I'm gay, and am very conscious about my safety levels when travelling abroad. Islamic countries often have a very poor reputation of treating gays well, and I generally feel that I have to avoid them in my travels. In your opinion, is this wariness warranted, or do you think I could safely visit Pakistan free from harassment?   "
43,"Well...I'm  not exactly sure what he would think. Unfortunately  he's no longer here to ""think"" anything. I do know he would want me to be happy though."
44,"It's great :) I moved back to the place I was born (not the place mentioned in my post) somewhere very rural where I knew I couldn't get back into the industry even if I tried. I met a wonderful man who I fell in love with. He knows everything about me and is very accepting of it all. 2 years later and I am full time step mom to his 2 beautiful children and have a 2 month old of my own and I couldn't be happier. I'm a stay at home mom and am still healing from everything I went through/put myself through but my little girl makes everything better. I always had a chance of getting back into my old ways, until I had her. I could never do those things again, not that I have anything against people that do, but I know I can find other ways to give her a good life. I couldn't ask for anything more."
45,It is 50°C for all non-Americans.
46,Why can you not say burglar alarm properly? 
47,As fucko.
48,sure man but you are welcome here and you will be accepted here.
49,"Yeah, totally. Like [this] (https://twitter.com/louisa_compton/status/746279848180592640)"
50,Why does your AMA suck so bad?
51,Man i have to say that i love my team sometimes they play good and most of the times bad.
52,What grade did you get in English?
53,In my opinion its the great for the wealthy but not so great for the poor. i belong to a middle class family and have been enjoying life thus far. we dont have to fear for our lives every moment but sometimes we get terrorist attacks just like the rest of the world and hundreds die but we dont get the sympathy that we give when ten of some other country die.
