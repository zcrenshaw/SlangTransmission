6,"Ok, so I won't bother you with the science, if you want more details, don't hesitate to pm me. 

This debate i.e, wether global warming is true or not, or if it is of anthropogenic origin (caused by humans) does not exist in the scientific community. Any climate/data/physics/math scientist that has an understanding of the climate system, and that has looked at the data will tell you that **global warming is happening, and that it is indeed caused by us**. There has not been one paper published in a respected journal that has been able to challenge the existence and cause of global warming (actually there were a couple but they have been withdrawn because of their shitty science).

So why is it that when you try to inform yourself, you find that there are clearly to sides on the matter? Well, deniers, who are usually not scientists, are very active on internet, and spread a lot of wanna be science bullshit. Nobody is here to check their ""analysis"", and to someone that has no knowledge on the subject like you, it appears that there are two sides. 

You might have heard of one emeritus MIT professor that claims global warming is a hoax. Why would you not believe him? I mean, he is an MIT professor right? Thing is, he is only one scientist against thousands that all object his view, but he gets as much media attention as the other side. On top of that, he is old, stubborned and has not been able to defend his view in a peer-reviewed journal.  

The media are also guilty of presenting the problem as one with two sides with equal weights (50%,50%) when the weights are more realistically 0.01%,99.99%. Or in other words, the media presents the issue as deniers vs non-deniers when it is actually tens of thousands of scientists and papers that all agree vs two or three old farts with no peer-reviewed publications on the subject.

Now, the world is not gonna end, but we will have to face major geopolitical issues in the next 50 years if nothing is done. Our civilization has succeeded in colonizing the planet, and one symptom of humanity's success is the overuse of earth's resources to satisfy our demand for food and energy. We have and are burning a **lot** of fossil fuel. The speed at which CO2 has increased in our atmosphere is unprecedented! 280 to 400ppm in 150 years! That's nuts! In comparison, the difference in CO2 from natural oscillation such as the transition between glacial (ice ages), and interglacial (not ice age) period is only of 80ppm and occurred over &gt;50000 years. In 150 years we released 120ppm, and by 2100, if nothing is done, we will have released over 500ppm to the atmosphere.

8,"Bed bugs ""bags"" they cost between 40-100 dollar per mattress and bed spring doubled zipper are more than 100% more effective so go that distance. Spray every possible item with isopropyl alcohol. It had zero residual but kills bugs on contact. 

If you want I can tell you the best places to look for infestation prior to move in.

If an heirloom is infested 2 years in a sealed plastic container guarantees death. Bed bugs can live up to 18 months without feeding in isolation but nobody ever listens to that so I always say 2 years. Like when a it guy says to leave it unplugged for a minute while usually 15 seconds is more than enough. Nobody ever listens. "

12,"These posts always irritate me. I feel like the intent is often not to edify, or to satisfy anyones curiosity, but to brag about one's apparent ability to disregard the well being of others. This particular post seems no different. You just want everyone to know how cunning you think you are, and how special and superior this makes you. I guess if you truly are unable to care about anyone but yourself, or at least struggle to do so, then this isn't really surprising. This post, like anything you do, will be self serving."
13,"All I got from my mother was that ""she found out."" Since she has 2 kids, I'm assuming the fact somehow came out during the pregnancy process?"
14,"(Gently giving this advice)
You don't need her to go through therapy. You WERE neglected and you WERE forced to grow up in a traumatic environment. At a minimum you could benefit from help dealing with that. Your sister was more worried about your mother than she was about your safety and well-being. 

Just as important, if you see someone who specializes in hoarders and children of hoarders, they can help you cope with your mom now, and mitigate some of her current hoarding behaviors. You already have one room full of stuff you never go into."
15,"He may have been your father, but he wasn't your daddy."
16," - There were people lying around in the hospital, when the bombs fell we had to see what/who and we could rescue. Our hospital was not very large and the main building was bombed(Americans bombed it because the Nazis had put the cannons on top of the hospital, this was one of the worst things. The patients were all killed when the bombs dropped) The nurses tried to pull everyone out of the main building when the bombing raid started. Some of the nurses were even killed trying to evacuate them. Seeing other nurses dying trying to save others was terrible.

 - We had trenches we would bury the dead in behind the hospital. During the war everything was bombed, we would go through the streets to pickup the dead and bury them. At the end of the war we dug up the trenches where burials occurred. Usually the men did all of the but we did have to help too. Digging up decaying corpses was the worst, however mostly the men did it. I just couldn't do it."

21,"I have quite a few moments that will never leave me.  Some great, some terrible.

A moment in which is imprinted in my memory, that changed my thought process?

We got stationed in a very violent place.  I though ""War ""was about hurting people to protect the populous at this point.  

We stopped at a insurgents house.  He was a bad guy, but we didn't have enough info to kill/jail him at this point.  His 5 year old son had a 6 month old shrapnel wound to the head.

The father hated us, we hated him.  

How dare we not try to save the kid.  

We set up a impromptu surgical station in the house.  The father and mother thought we where going to kill the child.  Enemies and all that.  They screamed and fought us while we set up the station and started to cut his head open.

We pulled a small piece of shrapnel out of his head, cut off the dead tissue, stitched him back up, drained the abscess that had grown.  We turned him back over to the parents after surgery.  

We stopped by about one a week after that, to make sure the kid was doing ok.  The father became an informant for us, with no pushing.  He never realized people could just be kind, regardless of affiliation.




"
22,"-  
Oh definitely I felt compassion, it was a human being. We do things which we might regret on our deathbed but I was there to help everywhere I would, it was not for me to judge. It is so bad if someone was sick and dying. Sometimes they would ask me to come and sit with them until they were dead. That was one thing I could do, some people couldn't do it but I could unless if it was a child.

- Yes, the first ones that came to Berlin took girls and had sex with them. We were scared to death, I was at least. I remember we were telling everyone to hide the women when the russians were raiding the houses, we did our best to hide the women. The russians took valuables, alcohol and unfortunately women. I remember going to one of the hospital and there was a russian sleeping in one of the beds, and I was even afraid of the sleeping one.

- They wanted to win until the end, the Nazis. Nearing the end the people knew that they were not going to win the war, at least I think. They of course said, “we are going to win” but we all knew better.

25,"Your dog is highly unlikely to become infested. Bed bugs are species specific by evolution. The bugs could travel but are unlikely to if it was less than a week.

Best preventative is to wash your linens once every other week for the next two years but really you should probably already be doing that.

Either way your neighbor is a douche."
26,"Aiiii. 2 weeks. Sorry to hear that, and I feel your pain. Things that sometime worked for me: when the stone is moving (intense pain), load up on drugs (suppositories are my weapon of choice) and immediately jump in the shower, I turn on the hot water (burning water), and massage my kidney area with the shower head. I'm not sure if the burning water becomes an anaesthetic or it dilates my veins, but I've passed 2 kidney stones like that, and I've dodged hospitals a few times.

If it's a tough one that just won't move, I like to do bursts of exercise (running mostly) after loading up on water. I don't like to drink all day, but whenI do, I just sip the entire bottle and then go for a run.

Lastly, do you realize how lucky your are?

At the time of donation, your father was likely looking at some 80's porn, furiously whacking off in a small room to get some money for maybe student loans. There are so many factors of why you shouldn't be here compared to most. If I were you, I would buy a lottery ticket. "

37,"You seem pretty able to deal with seemingly ""tough"" questions, so I'll throw this one out there: have you considered doing a ""living wake"" as you get closer to the end? My wife's aunt had one, and it was by far the most powerful experience I've ever shared with a group of people. About 100 or so people were there, and we all unanimously agreed it was crazy we'd never been to one before. She taught us a lot about dying, I'd be happy to share more of what we learned and some of the things she did if you're interested. 

Lots of love to you and your family. Hard times lay ahead, and while it sucks to go so young, there will be many blessings to be found as well, and it's a gift in and of itself to be able to see the end coming (though I'm sure some would disagree, but saying goodbye is really powerful, in my opinion)."

2)  Coal:  no new coal power plants, reduce emissions from coal by at least 30% by 2025

3) Road transport: last fossil fuel car sold before 2035

4) Aviation and shipping: develop and get agreement on a 1.5°C compatible vision

5)      New buildings: all new buildings fossil-free and near zero energy by 2020

6) Building renovation: increase rates from &lt;1% in 2015 to 5% by 2020

7) Industry:  all new installations in emissions-intensive sectors are low-carbon after 2020; maximise material efficiency

8)      Reduce emissions from forestry and other land use to 95% below 2010 levels by 2030, stop net deforestation by the 2020s

9) Commercial agriculture:  keep emissions at or below current levels, establish and disseminate regional best practice, ramp up research

10)  CO2 removal: begin research and planning for negative emissions"

55,"1 month is only a start...

I was 5 months clean and things were looking up. I didn't crave it, I was getting healthier and happier. I thought that was the end. Relapse will always follow people like us. We can get addicted to food, alcohol, weed, gambling, sex, porn.

My only advice against coke is that you HAVE to rid yourself of temptation. You can't be around people who do it. You can't have access to it. Getting rid of friends who do it is truly the hardest part. Especially because we'll find other addicts anyway. We'll mention it at a bar as an accomplishment, ""I used to have a bad addiction to cocaine"". The person across from you empathizes, they don't judge you, and you find out some of their secrets. This is how it starts again.

Addicts are non-judgmental people. They also crave emotional roller coasters (disasters). We will always be friends with addicts. They'll become our best friends.

It only takes one day. You'll try it again and it's not that bad. It feels good. You have full control. Stress is our number one enemy. Anxiety is our enemy. We will be tested with reasons to do bad things to ourselves. Because what else is there to do? Life can't be this boring and mundane.

I apologize for the vent. I'm talking to myself because I'm only 12 days sober and it's still the hardest 12 days that I've been through. Here's to two more weeks and being where you are. But please don't be me at 5 months thinking you are safe. Always be cautious.

58,"Working as an escort made me have a hard time trusting. It affected my relationships a LOT. I thought everyone was unfaithful. I never saw them as a paycheck but I definitely felt more anxious, paranoid and unsafe to a degree when I was around men.

Luckily now I am with a great man that has zero judgment about my past and is extremely supportive and good to me, so our sex life is great. But for years I would have flashbacks and didn't enjoy sex.

I never had a pimp--I heard too many horror stories (like being a petite young woman was much safer) lol

I can't speak for everyone who works as an escort that does drugs but for me it was most definitely a coping mechanism. An attempt to ease the reality of what I was doing and try to forget or mask the feelings I had about myself.

I was never busted but the first place I worked at in the industry (a massage parlor) got busted on my day off. 5 girls were arrested and mugshots were all over the news. http://www.newsandtribune.com/news/business/five-women-arrested-for-prostitution-in-jeffersonville/article_34cd7466-762b-58ea-ac78-34c78fd9ef23.html

Speaking of that bust, that is how my parents found out. My father works at a local news station and the story was brought up in his morning meeting. He saw my photo on the website and he immediately called my mother. She had me come over and had the DVR paused with the news story queued and I had to sit and watch it with her. They just couldn't believe it...I didn't know what to say or how to explain myself. They were very hurt and scared for me.

Thank god I never got pregnant or got any STDS, I always used protection (I did one thing right)"
59,"Oh jeez. I wish I could figure that out. I think it is to a degree because of sexual repression. The whole ne-sex-before-marriage thing (although most of the time, in practice no one follows this) creates its own pressure. I think the whole idea that sex without marriage is a sin creates its own psychology. The men begin to see flirting and sex with a woman as a relationship between a predator/prey.
Sex is seen, at least subconsciously, not as a mutual relation but as the guy FUCKing or violating the female. 
So they get unbearably sexual in flirting. "
60,"She would. My mother raised me to be a strong, independent woman who goes after what she wants and to never take shit from anyone. She may not agree with my choices, but she would be proud of me for being true to myself. "
61,"Did she feel compassion for the people she treated? Meaning if it was SS soldiers or worse officers.

62,"China is definitely in. I believe the Chinese government see Trump's withdrawal as an opportunity for China to assert it's leadership on the geopolitical scene. I am no political expert but we may be witnessing the transition of China from a new-rich, non-inovative, producing country which is focused on its short term economy to a more consumeristic country (such as the USA or Europe). China wants to become an innovative country and a leader in all fields, including the geopolitical scene.   

Here are the projected emissions of China updated 15 days ago:

To be fair to China: despite having had the largest world emissions, its cumulative emissions (how much they emitted since 1850) remain much smaller than the US.

It never occurred to me that it was bed bugs. I was thinking an allergy to mosquito bites or something. We were referred to an allergy specialist, and were trying out different prescriptions for her. I saw spotting on her sheets and assumed it was her scratching at night. I changed her bedding to wash it and never saw a bug. I never checked because I assumed bed bugs were for dirty people. One morning however, I saw one right on top of the sheet. I had no idea what kind of bug it was, but had a bad feeling. I called(screamed) for my husband. We did a quick Google search, and it was confirmed. I cried feeling like a POS for sending my little girl to bed with these things.  I stripped the bed. We didn't want to drag the mattress through the house. We threw the matress, frame, box spring, headboard, and footboard right out the second story window.it jostled them free and we saw just how bad it was. We called the bug busters. He checked all over and THANK GOD they hadn't made it out of her room. There was no signs in any other rooms of the house.  We cleaned and double dried all the linens and her clothes.  We even went through her book shelf page by stinking page. We sprayed and scrubbed.  The room was closed off for weeks. I went in every day to check for signs and clean. It has been a year and a half now.

Either that, or this could be the most idiotically planned coup in the world history. At least %35 of population would agree that this was a fake coup. 
Each day Erdoğan divides the country more and more with his declarations, speeches. Half of the population hates the other half. Whereas the major divide used to be between Turkish and Kurdish people.
I am not sure what would be considered as a normal turk, however I know, except for some tiny liberal and young portion of the population, an average turk doesn't like kurds because of the claims they make.
Ataturk, at the initial building of the Turkish republic, said that anyone who calls themselves Turkish and lives in turkish land and speaks the language is turkish regardless of their ethnicity. Kurds, however, by foregrounding their ethnicity are seen as separatist who wants to divide the Turkish land. For that reason, many turks don't like kurds. I, myself, likely have Kurdish roots from my father's side, but as a girl born and raised in Istanbul, I never considered myself as Kurdish.

As for Syria, normal turks (as in the sane %50 of population) believe that turkey shouldn't really intervene in middle east, unless it threatens the turkish state directly. Many of the population are against the unregulated acceptance of refugees"

They are controvertial things that the church used to deny are true and now are admitting are true and trying to intigrate them into the lessons at church slowly over time. There's important stuff in there like how the book of mormon was translated, the book of abraham and the egyptian papyri problems, Joseph Smith recorded several different versions of the first vision (the first recording of it in his diary, is not the version told in the church), women used to heal the sick in the church and now it's not allowed, black people were denied the priesthood for decades (so they couldn't get married in the temple), and Joseph Smith married some women who were already married, and some young girls, at least one who was 14.

In a decade, the world will continue breaking warmth records and the oceans will be slightly higher. The western world is not going to feel much on a day to day basis. But the effects of global warming are already felt in the tropics and subtropics. 

The impacts of global warming will become more serious in 50 to 100 years. The main geopolitical problems to expect will be massive population migrations, shortages and water availability.

92,"Yes. The worst. It's so painful that it makes other kinds of pain ""enjoyable"":  when passing a KS, I used to try to hurt myself by pinching myself or such, hoping to ""transfer"" the pain, or distract my brain. 
I've heard it's common with pregnant ladies. Real question here is, is it comparable to the pain of labor and birth?"
93,How will you feel if someone shows up with one of those horse masks and they wait to go last then when you remove your blindfold you realize they swapped him out with a real horse?
94," - See above
 - I dont know
 - I try to avoid drinking soda as it is not really healthy. at the time they didnt exist, I didnt know about soft drinks until I came to America
"
95,What are the chances the half brother your mom mentioned is a crusty sock?
96,He knows. He got sick and was in the hospital. That's when it was discovered. I was about 16 at the time. 
97,"As you can see, I'm not a BIG fan. 
"
98,Hey a terrible thing happened that ended up great for you! Congrats! No sarcasm intended.
99,"Fuuuuuuck

You're a trooper.  Thank you for sharing all this.  It sounds like it can be overwhelming.

You thinking about moving out?  Or you taking care of moms?"
100,"My thoughts which started and stopped with the reading of your post are that, assuming it's true, it's neato"
101,3/17
102,Usually more goal oriented. When you've got an itch you gotta go spelunking
103,I am definitely not an optimist. But we nevertheless need to push as hard as we can in this direction. 
104,Not comparable. Birth was a breeze compared to a kidney stone. ( giving birth still sucks lol)
105,"No one other than my family knew. I kept it a secret from everyone.

I had only a few friends. They kept asking ""why can't I come in your house?""

And then they said that if I don't invite them over, they wouldn't be friends with me anymore. 

And then because I didn't invite them, they would spread rumors about me and my house."
106,"Apparently he was shooting blanks, yes."
107,Lol Rawr
108,Was there ever any fighting very close to you?
109,How did you feel?? What did you say? :o
110,"I found out I was adopted at the age of 30.  It was a shock, but my parents are still my parents."
111,"Are you one of those hosts that like to talk over the song?

If not, you are awesome.

If yes, would you be willing to go skydiving with a prepacked parachute I've made for you?

But a little more serious question, why are stations so hesitant to expand their play list? IE it seems like with most stations you would never know major bands like metallica ect ever had more that one or two hit songs. they never seem to play a wide selection from a band. my sirius membership ends this month and im not going to renew just for that reason. id rather just load up an ipod with what i like."
112,I have all kinds I worked on and off for 9 years!
113,"No, we never went to therapy.

When asked to go to therapy, my mother would get defensive and shout.

I was told when I was younger to never tell other people about my house. ""Don't tell anyone about our house because then they will accuse our mom of neglect and take you away from her,"" said my oldest sister.

I've never even told anyone in real life about the living conditions I was raised in. No one knows about it except my immediate family.
 "
114,6 months. Got it. 
115,I wonder how you want this to be proven^^
116,You better watch it or I'll cut off your toes and use them for pizza toppings. Just kidding.
117,"I'm neither Mormon nor ex-Mormon so I don't have a hat in the ring.  But I wonder if you're aware of the *anguish* families go through when one of them can't sustain the belief anymore.  

I fully understand and respect that it's your choice to make but before you get married or have kids I'd *seriously* urge you to read the [exMormon reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/) or listen to some of the [*Mormon Stories* podcasts](http://www.mormonstories.org) to see what the consequences of the misogyny and  pressures to conform are like and what the *heartbreak* and *betrayal* of tearing large families up is.  It ain't pretty!  

Or go to [*Feminist Mormon Housewives*](http://www.feministmormonhousewives.org) and see what the struggles of believing women who are intelligent and independent are.  (You know your Mormon husband will expect you to have kids and make them and him the entire focus of your life, right?) 

Then I wish you happiness in your truly informed choice.  It's your life and you should lead it *your* way.  "
118,"In case nobody shows, [this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtH6-7rj_TU) might help answer your question."
119,Does she realize she's exhibiting signs of neurosis? 
120,"What are the top 10 best methods to curb global warming and climate change? 

What should we stop\start doing?"
121,The fact that I had to google search what they are about a week ago makes me think I need to get out more
122,"If you selected 100 beds at random (average community, no poverty, ect) how many of them would have bedbugs? 

Are bedbugs only found in beds?"
123,"They didn't to my knowledge, they stopped using us but cars are usually easy to deal with because high heat generally kills bed bugs and doesn't kill cars. I suggested many time high alcohol solutions (kills bed bugs on contact) and heavy heating the car to kill the eggs.

They went to a cheaper company that didn't actually offer a resolution and mostly sold roach killing pesticides. Shortly thereafter I left the corporation and went freelance. "
124,Any stories?
125,I would be curious to hear your thoughts after you read it
126,"There is also the rumour that some also get hymen reconstruction secretly as to be seen as ""virgins"""
127,"TIL that I will never stop in Fayetteville, AR.

Though, to be fair, I almost definitely wouldn't have even if I hadn't read this AMA."
128,What was the worst thing you witnessed personally?
129,This just keeps getting worse. I'm just picturing him as Tiny Tim from a Christmas Carol now.
130," 
 - At the end of the war when they didnt know what would happen to Berlin, they told us we had to go. I went to Saxony after the war and lived on a farm for a bit. Every morning we would milk the cows and have that along with bread for breakfast. We were relieved.
 
 - It wasn't bad for me in the beginning and got worse and worse, I was young and had a beautiful uniform from BDM (Organization of german girls). The food was scarce and they had to fly everything in thanks to the Americans. We only had light for a few hours out of the day, life was really quite something. I had many friends who were much worse off, whose houses were destroyed in bombings and relatives killed. Our house was the only house on the block left after the war.

134,If you win I will run through an open field during a storm with a 10 foot copper rod and post it on YouTube. 
135,"Never been married and no children. I had receptionist jobs, serving and bar tending jobs. "
136,You're in for a surprise when you go through the Temple. You'll have to throw those store bought undies in the trash =/ 
137,"Well, since you have so much in common, maybe your girlfriend is actually your sister."
138,Are you upset that they didn't tell you earlier? 
139,Is she still hoarding?  
140,"We moved out of that house several years ago and moved 3 hours away. I haven't been there since. 

I can't move out because I can't find a job."
141,I worry about bed bugs getting on my luggage while it is in in the cargo of an airplane. Is that even feasible? I switched from cloth suitcases to the hard plastic. Any suggestions?
142,proof?  Would be interesting to hear more about this.
143,"I would argue that it is actually the contrary. The appeal to authority is made by people who acknowledge one person's statement based on his status i.e. MIT professor. If you are convinced by this person because of his arguments and work (e.g. published paper on the subject), then that's ok for me. But it is rarely the case. People acknowledge his statement purely because of his status. 

The reality is that there are thousands of prominent scientists (not just MIT; NOAA, NASA, Princeton, Cambridge... everywhere!) that have actually done work and published in peer reviewed publications that come to the conclusion that global warming is anthropogenic. The deniers are both a very few percentage of scientists and have no peer reviewed work defending their views. 

I understand people don't like the 1-10000 scientist argument because of past examples e.g. Darwin/Galileo. But the situation is very different today. The 10000 scientist actually have proof and have done serious work to come to this conclusion i.e, it is not an opinion, it is the conclusion that emerges from their analysis. The opposing ones just throw opinions without any solid ground for their assertion. 

Show me an analysis of the data with a solid theory that brings down the state of the art and I will gladly reconsider the view that emerges from my own analysis. "
144,I'm an esthetician now and unfortunately the fast money went fast but I'm much happier now making less.

probably lemon meringue"
147,my father was passing one while driving a bus in NYC. 
148,"I know this is a very generic question, but here goes... 

What is the whole deal? Is it true or not? I always hear extremes but never actual answers or facts (partly my fault as I have not really researched it myself). I realize this may be a more in depth answer so feel free to sum things up as you see fit. Also I'd love to hear your opinions on the matter."

154,Favorite kind of pie?
155,"I have 2 older sisters, who are 6 and 9 years older. They moved out at 18 and went to college 2 hours away.

It impacted our relationship because the relationship with my sisters became abusive. They took out the frustration of living in our house out on me. I was daily verbally and physically abused by the sisters. After they moved out, they would still verbally and physically abuse me when they came home during college breaks."
156,"I was not caring for my mother. 

I'm not supporting myself at all. We live off of social security survivor's benefits and investment accounts. 

My sisters did not pay anything to go to college and graduate school because we were so low income (10,000 a year) that they were given the maximum possible amount of grants and scholarships for the lowest income students.  

I went to community college and I'm completing the degree through distance education at a state university. I have a year left. Like my sisters, I received many grants for the most low-income students."

Thank you so much, that's really nice to hear.

160,Do you have any pleasant memories from that time that you held onto to try and offset the negative?
161,"Now I want to Google clown bukkake.


Edit: I should not have done that."
162,xDDD
163,"I've lived it up and I finally have a wonderful husband and man in my life. He has taken on my children as if they were his own. You can't beat that, honey! 😊"
164,"Damn. My parents in law are mild hoarders. They leave dog poop everywhere, the house is extremely messy and disorganized, they can't let go of anything, and have a whole room so full of junk there's just a 5 foot long path to walk through. I had to live with them for a year or so, and I was absolutely miserable. I can't imagine putting up with much worse for almost my whole life. Do you plan on moving away once you graduate?"
165,17 point scale? You madman.
166,I used to be the account manager for Tucan Travel. We ran tours through Guatemala. What exactly is special about the fact you travelled the same route hundreds of thousands of people travel every year? You might as well do an AMA as a resident of whatever country you're from
167,I'm so glad the entire /r/exmormon subreddit got to join me today but I do have a life to get on with. Thanks everyone for playing along have a good day!
168,The plan is for fair game. I will be blindfolded and tied to the bed. Stranger play is super hot to me. I'm just excited in general to be used like a rag doll. This has always been a fantasy of mine.
169,"One.  We did not know who was putting in IEDs at night, at that spot.  We found a couple in that 400 meter stretch, but never saw anyone planting them.  

After someone was hit (he lost his thumb, use of motor function in arm)

Pic of medical work below 

https://imgur.com/gallery/p8wvE

We became very scared and put a overwatch position on the area to try and catch the men doing it.

It wasn't men.  It was 2 boys doing what their father told them.  We found out how young they where when we shot one setting another IED, in the pitch black of night.

My little brother was his age at the time.  I have thought about that every time I see or talk to my brother, who is 23 now.  

I have to set alarms and calendar setting to make sure I visit with him.  Usually I cry after, but at least I get to spend time with him now.

I usually think about me reading the Harry Potter series to him before that deployment, cuddled up in bed, switching off sentences and pushing him to read it himself.

After all, a 12 year old will follow the advice of his dad or older brother no matter what.

170,It went perfect! Some mistakes but i fixed them on time. This was the second time performing on stage. So for me it was good! 
171,My decision is that he is 100% my father while he's alive. If curiosity gets the better of me later in life I can research. If medically needed I can try to find him.
172,brave man. bet you found out you liked it and now you can never go back.

179,"Not sure, but I have heard similar rumors."
180,Oh yes. 5/7
181,"So Smith translated the golden plates that he found by looking through a hat, you couldn't make it up, well, oh never mind.

Do you wear magic underwear?"
182,"I'll put it this way, the most I've ever made in one day was $400, but I caddied for two different members at different times. Other more experienced caddies have made thousands in one day but that's because the member was playing for big money and the caddie gave them a good read on a putt or what not."
183,LOL
184,"I spent years learning every technique to find and track down bed bugs, bed bugs seeking dogs can find them faster than me, but the cost of training them is rarely cost efficient than a human. My own sucess rate versus trials against dogs in spotting them was around  75% rate for me versus an around  85% for a properly trained dog. But the dog cost 175 dollars an hour to enter a premise and I was closer to 30-60. 

The benefits of a good bed bug dog vs a person is also time. The Dog can check faster, around 50% faster. So while I am similar in fibding rates vs the dogs trained are definitely better for straight across time if you want to search a building efficiently.

I also can and could inform versus a dog just being able to identify."
185,What is your preferred diabetus medication? 
186,I'll send you the plastic packaging to sniff
187,"Like in your case as most, addiction also hurts the people you love. A realisation for me to stop was when i couldn't afford to send flowers to mum on mother's day (we live in different countries)  because i blew all my wages on partying the night before. .nd i paid for the drugs without hesitation but for a minute i thought 60euro for a bouquet of flowers was too expensive. The value of 1 bag of coke, of which ive probablt bought hundreds, was too expensive to get a gift for my own mother :( .My family deserves better than that!  Its nice to hear another success story. Did you know at the time? Or was your dad good at hiding it?"
188,"So did erdogan totally fake the coup so he could set himself up as supreme ruler?

Are people tired of his shit?

What do normal turks think of kurds?  What do normal turks think of syria?"
189,"I don't plan on ever telling my dad that I know. Mom's reason was basically how much my dad didn't want anyone to know.

I asked my mother to place the donor's info (or any that she has) in a sealed envelope so after my dad passes away I can do some research into health issues just like you said."
190,"I was battling addiction that formed while doing it making normal jobs nearly impossible. It took my self worth, I was raped, held at knifepoint there was many traumatizing situations I encountered. "
191,"What were the demographics of your clients?

What did most of them do for a living?"
192,I'm happy to hear it. Here's to a beautiful life! 
193,Beautiful family! :)
194,"Great questions. No I don't talk over the songs. That drives me nuts. 

For the radio station I work for, we don't update our selection because of the audience we market to. We tend to do everything with older people in mind, so we play older music, keep the same jingles we've always had, and keep our style consistent. Right now, for example, we are about to have a preacher come into the guest studio to preach for about thirty minutes, because the elderly here are typically evangelical Christians. 

tldr: stations market to their audience and don't want to take a risk. "
195,Swallow. Always swallow. ;)
196,"Consider sobriety. If you continue to use, the symptoms may return, get worse, or become permanent. "
197,It would be interesting to see if this brother looked like me but that's about as much interest as I currently have.
198,Do you think other people know you grew up in squalor? Did you have friends as a kid?
