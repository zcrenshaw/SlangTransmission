0,"Nope. I'm an athiest. I don't really mind, I don't value my life highly. The thing about being someone who's been terminally ill for years is that people isolate themselves from you, because they think it'll hurt less when you finally succumb to the illness. 

I'm honestly not sure how I feel about this. I don't want death to break me, I don't fear it. But at the same time, why is everyone acting as if I'm already dead? 

It's not nice to know that people are ditching you, because so is your body.

7,"I was first sent to this evangelical bootcamp by my father because I witnessed my best friend die in front of me as she was hit by a car while we were crossing the street late at night. I was shamed for the accident because we had been intoxicated after I bought alcohol with a fake ID. 

The reverend sat me down the second day I was there (I was told by my father i was volunteering for a few days which turned into an 11 month stay) and flat out told me my best friend was in hell based off of the evidence of the Bible because she had alcohol in her system when she died. I was in shock and couldn't believe it and threw all of any little conviction of the Bible to hold truth down the drain. I saw my stay there more of a punishment than anything and stayed tight lipped and got really good at zoning out during the daily 4 hr bible studies.

I eventually left and things were going well with me, trying to put it all behind me thinking I paid my dues for my friend's death, but for some reason the Reverends claim left a thorn in my heart.
Ten years later I ended up in NYC and looking for direction and friends I ended up meeting some very odd people. I let a psychic live with me for free and the first night she channeled my friend and almost instantly became completely overwhelmed and started crying saying she had to disconnect. She told me after that my friend was the most beautiful angel she had ever felt and that she was protecting me and to talk to her. In exchange for rent the psychic taught me her abilities to channel this alternate reality and in turn I actually began having psychic experiences and felt myself vibrating at a very high frequency. It all became too much for my sanity and I checked myself into a hospital where my father flew in, packed up my apartment and said I needed help. He thought this evangelical bootcamp had 'fixed' me the last time (going ten years without being problematic was his definition of being fixed) and sent me there once again. 

This time I took the experience as a sign from God and became the best student there. I feverishly took notes and studied the Bible, I prayed without ceasing, I worshipped and even spoke in tongues (which was very creepy sounding but according to them we all have our unique tongue that the Holy Spirit communicated through- no joke I sounded like the grudge). When I walked through the gates the second time I told God i would follow all of their rules to become as close to him as possible and I let go of all of the psychic tools I had learned relating to the meditations I would do to channel the 'other side' and simply allowed them to brainwash me as they see fit. They claimed I wasn't mentally ill as the hospital had suggested but had been playing with demons and was there to heal. I submerged myself into my art (fashion design) and even thought of a new brand H.W.J.T. How Would Jesus Think derived from the previous fad of WWJD bc I thought before you can do something like Jesus, you ought to understand how to think like him. I thought this revelation was brilliant but the other pastors didn't really seem impressed. I think they were honestly a bit freaked out how this ""secular"" girl came to love Jesus so intensely and quickly. It felt like they never truly trusted me no matter how much I tried to prove my conviction for Jesus was genuine in my heart. I did get a boost of confidence when some missionary teens visited the compound and loved my sketches and were really encouraging of the direction God was leading me. That was seriously the most encouragement I received there, from some teenagers called to follow Christ.

Anyways, I had become what I considered to be a 'prayer warrior' and really felt the power of prayer and thought it could heal. The treatment plan was 6 months in order to graduate and two days before I reached the 6 month mark I felt compelled to leave because my grandmother was very ill and I thought I was strongly trained enough in prayer that I could make a positive impact on her. When I tried to leave, everybody tried to convince me not to, but I was  convince God had called me to go help my grandmother and how could they stop me from something they so profusely preach? The reverend was not at the compound but I spoke to him on the phone and he said something along the lines of the devil taking over me and I read to him an encouraging letter one of the teens had written me about how it was so evident Christ was working through me. He actually mocked the letter and belittled it and I knew that not only was this guy a complete hypocrite but there was no way I would meet eye to eye to him. So I left. My father was out of town but pleaded that I not visit my grandmother after he had spoken with the reverend and so instead I went to another city and stayed with a friend and we ended up praying for my grandmother from there and she wasn't even a Christian or liked the idea of Christianity, just a supportive friend.

My father arrived in town the following day and picked me up to finally visit my grandmother. I had left the bootcamp the day before very quickly and decided just to leave my suitcases and come back for them. I was honestly grateful just to finally have a bit of freedom. Well we passed through the bootcamp to pick up my belongings and my father waited in the car outside of the gate. As I was inside the room collecting my belongings as quickly as possible the reverend stepped in. He stated that he needed to search my things because I might steal something, I was tired yet more than willing to comply and sifted through my suitcase as he peered in. I then went back to the closet collecting my things and I was hunched over when he cornered me. He was telling me I was a spoiled brat and he didn't like my attitude and to look at him when he was speaking to me. I was so over his bullshit and ready to leave, i literally just stood up and looked at him in the eyes with kind of a 'wtf can I do for you?'  expression. Well that apparently enraged him, he was so used to having people kiss his feet and cry to him that who was I? This little girl to defy him. He instantly got this horribly angry look in his eyes and grabbed me by the neck, twisted me around and body slammed me to the floor. I was in shock and I actually started laughing for a second because I thought that this man is absolutely insane!! I tried wiggling away from him, but this guy is huge and pinned me down. I then said ""Yes, reverend, give me an exorcism, I'm going to spit green pea soup all over you"" sarcastically and then it looked like something inside of him clicked and he agreed and began denouncing the devil inside of me and casting out all of my demons in the name of Jesus. It then occurred to me that my dad was right outside and if he saw this man on top of me he would save me and this reverend would also lose his credibility. I began to scream as loud as I could for my father, screaming at the top of my lungs ""Daddy!"" And I saw that there was a young missionary volunteer in the room just staring, jaw opened and wide eyed, obviously in shock with what was going on in front of her eyes. Getting physical with residents wasn't an everyday occurrence. I screamed at her to get my father but instead she ran to get other pastors. When the other pastors came in, i was relieved at first until one came up to me and held me down even more followed by another entering the room with rope while another prayed over my head. I felt like I was in the fucking twilight zone. I continued screaming for my father, not understanding why he hadn't entered the room yet when the reverend said the most chilling lie: ""Your fathers not here, he left."" That moment changed everything, I thought, could this be true? Does my father really think I'm insane and in need of an exorcism? I instantly became more afraid than I ever had been before and realized I just needed to get the hell out of that place, I just needed to run as far and as quick as possible, but first I had to get this monster off of me. I immediately went into submission mode and my body became limp. He was saying ""yes, surrender in the name of Jesus"" as I led him to believe that this was the power of Christ stopping me from constricting against him. I then began crying as hard as I could, anything to get this disgusting man off of me and just kept repeating I was sorry. He then, embraced me in his arms and in front of the other pastors asked why I had hit him first. I knew this guy was a snake and just kept apologizing over and over and he held me in his arms which felt like was forever. I was disgusted.

Well it turned out my father did not abandon me but was in fact locked out of the gate the moment I began screaming and they would not open the door until the reverend came out. The other pastors kept me cornered in the room as he took my father into a different room and told him I had attacked him and had serious mental issues and needed to seek clinical professional help. My father then actually left me there, as I begged him not to but he did promise to return. The pastors told me to take some pill that would calm me down and I eventually went to sleep. Ironic since they were so anti-medication there. I woke up the next morning and looked in the mirror, I had scratches all over my neck and chest and had a black eye. My parents where coming to get me that day so I packed up my things as quickly as possible and chained smoked outside of the gates as I waited for them to come pick me up. 

And that sir, is how you botch an exorcism. You identify it as one when it was actually just plain physical abuse and manipulation in the name of Jesus Christ. 

EDIT: TL;DR - A corrupt reverend beat the hell out of me when I tried to leave his compound because he didn't like my attitude. "

The notes descend and I am lowered back to the bed. This happend for about 10 times and was very peaceful.

Try to achieve that, maybe. But generally, live how you want without hurting other people. Sometimes we have to hurt people. Humans are disappointing, we disappoint people. There's nothing we can do.

But have common decency, and be happy.

56,"Hey thanks for the question! 

Like I said, I am studying full time so the way I think of the time spent with these men is like a part time- occasionally full time job. 

And by several I mean I currently have 3, the most I've had at once is 4. Luckily, two of the three I have now live out of town and out of state this limiting the amount of time I have to spend with them. Those two are what is know to the sugar bowl as ""side sugar"" cringy, I know, I didn't coin the term. 

Let me get this out of the way to be 100% blunt. Show me a woman doesn't have sex with someone she claims to be her sugar daddy, I'll show you a damn liar. 

When exactly the sex starts during the relationship varies
from each sugar baby and sugar daddies. Some girls have sex right away while some, myself included prefer to establish an ""allowance"" prior to having sex. 
Some sugar daddies will not handle this well, they are what we call Splenda daddies. (Once again, didn't coin the term.) 
The men who understand the need to establish a relationship and allowance prior to sex to show a commitment on both ends are the long term, occasionally hard to find sugar daddies. 

Is it just sex for money? Not all of it is. Dinners, shopping, companionship, being an open ear, being seen with them in public to boost their egos. In exchange, they do things such as cash surprises, monthly allowances, paying bills and taking care of the things that happen to the best of us, a flat tire, etc. 

:)"
57,"Are the sugar daddies aware of your other relationships? 

If not, how do you balance that? Has anyone ever found out about the others? What happened? 

Of they do, is there a pecking order? How do they handle sharing your time?"

He targets the women and children of anyone who has wronged him in his mind.  I'm a veteran on a somewhat fixed income so I must represent myself in court against his attorney.

Imagine getting thrown into a legal arena with a wooden sword against the gladiators.  We have little chance of victory and it costs money to serve him as well.  I've been directed to Victims Services by the Chandler Police and it's just disgusting to accept that."

Everything after this sentence was copied/pasted from various sources:


Sign them up for as many things as you can. Get them called repeatedly for sales information. So they repeatedly get harassed and they don't know why.
Also higher an exotic dancer that goes against their sexual preference to visit them at work.
Or even better if they are married, send them a gift basket with a card from ""the other woman/man"" saying ""I'm sorry please come back to me stud. Remember all those nights of passion?"" And have it delivered when you know the SO would be home to get it.

https://shipyourenemiesglitter.com/

You can also go to the library an go to the magazines and those ""first 3 issues free"" then they send a bill cards....well fill out a bunch in his name to his addy! Also go on sex toy websites and sign him up on their physical catalog mailing lists. Gay ones are great for male assholes. 
And last but not least take a sharpie and go to a couple gay bars an write on the stall wall ""straight but curious white 24 year old male looking for first time call xxx-xxx-xxx ask for blahblah"" I also wrote that same message on benches and bus stops and even in regular bathroom walls. 
My coworker had to change his number from all the calls an dirty voicemails. Don't post craigslist shit that leaves a trail unless you do it from a public library that doesn't log its users. 

I just googled ""mess with someone anonomously"" and all that came up on the first two results.

That glitter one seems like the best idea, as well as the gay magazines. Good luck pal

94,"Not rude at all! It's amazing, honestly. Sorry if I overshare in this reply, but that's one of the reasons I put this up on a throwaway account~

I don't have a *favorite* but it's certainly different with all of them. My favorite situation is me/John/Anna all together, which happens about twice a week when our work schedules are normal. We have three bedrooms in our apartment so things are fairly flexible on the arrangements, but on those nights we typically all go to bed together afterwards which the sentimental sap in me loves a lot.

Things with Anna tend to be a lot more passionate, and a lot more creative-- shower, terrace, kitchen, etc. John is (and this is probably hard to believe given our situation) a lot more traditional and tends to stick to the bed or couch, strictly. Anna is the most likely to bring a date home with her and dates around more than any of us, so she's the one most likely to learn 'new tricks' whereas John and I have been together so long that we've learned what the other likes. 

Brian comes over a couple times a week and has a lot of stress in his life-- stressful job, irritating roommates, etc. so he tends to be very rough and very dominant, which I have to be in the mood for to enjoy. He also isn't big on group sex, which means he'll typically come over to see one of us, or at least one of us at a time. 

Katie we call Hurricane Katie because she tends to give very little notice before she comes into town and will sometimes group text us about an hour before she's off her train, and it's always a really fun scramble to make sure we can all get together to see her. It's always worth it, and a lot of times Anna and I will send John off to play with Brian or someone new (or just set him up in front of the Playstation) and go have a girls day ft. facials and pedicures and normal girly date things.

We bring in new people sometimes --not as often as we used to-- and swing with other couples often. Personally, I like a three person setup but we've had a few bigger orgies before, with up to ten people. They're admittedly fun, but also tend to get logistically sometimes because the realities of a small-ish apartment and new margarita recipes don't always combine to allow you to give everyone the attention you want to."

I hope that it will be me that is harmed rather than another when it happens.

You going to freeze me out next time? I don't eat in restaurants like this so it's moot and hypothetical, but I'm just wondering."
104,"To be fair. The Star Wars thing. I literally might wish to go to the premiere. 

Or to meet Tyler and josh from twenty one pilots. "
105,"Haha, you make me sound so pretentious. I eat fast food *EVERY day* after work. More than I'd like to admit for sure.

I love food in general. I go to Dunkin donuts all the time haha.

"
106,Worst ama of all time 
107,"Yeah, it's awful. They say one person in the family who has it can wipe out 20. My dad was adopted without records. We had no idea what Huntington's was until he was diagnosed at 55."
108,Just how many weird people do you get a day? Not the people who come in to just buy stuff or ask questions but the really out there ones? And weirdest experience?
109,A friend of mine said he went to a 2-star restaurant and it cost him and his gf about $1500. Said it was a crazy amount of money but he would've rather experienced it than not. 
110,Have the customers tried hitting on you or your coworkers?  I can imagine it would be very cringeworthy if so
111,"Hey look, if I plunk down my $6.79, I better get my whole fucking Grand Slam. Don't be telling me you're *out* of biscuits. You can't *be* out of biscuits! So yeah, you better believe you'll have a fight on your hands but I'm pretty sure I'm in the right there."
112,"Just wanna clarify this for you, he used another font to 'confuse' the translator. "
113,Why?
114,Wanna come bang my stoma? Sounds fun. 
115,"I don't really care anymore.

I wanted to be free, but because I've been so trapped my entire life, I wanted to be free to feel ALIVE. Knowing my death is imminent can never make me feel alive. 

I don't feel sorry for myself. Honestly, my life has been an utter shitshow. 

But things make me happy, I'm not permanently stewing in apathy. I want to be happy, it just isn't easy."
116,"That makes me so happy, thank you so much x and I will try"
