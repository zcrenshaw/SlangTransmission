0,"First time in Markarth, traveler? Take my advice. You see anything, don't get involved. The city guard will take care of it."
1,I heard about you and your honeyed words.
2,Lightly armored means light on your feet. Smart.
3,"Got to thinking... maybe I'm the Dragonborn, and I just don't know it yet?"
4,"There are so many so it's hard to just name one...so I'll name a few...first of all, Donald Trump does not believe that all men and women are created equal and I do. Trump also admires authoritarians and dictators and I strongly oppose them. He also believe in a large, centralized federal government, whereas I believe power in Washington should be returned to the states and directly to the people. I've also accepted the fact that I am bald. ;-)"
5,"If I pillage ur village, how much would be my billage "
6,"When I save a town from 2  simultaneous dragons, but accidentally shoot a guard, why is that what you focus on? 

I saw you put 5 arrows into the back of your mate instead of stepping to the side and you didn't even get a warning. "
7,The Imperials think us lawless beasts. I am proof of their ignorance.
8,"See, there you go. Getting involved. Don't ask too many questions in Markarth. Safer for everyone that way."
9,We had that beast contained. And you released it! Why? Why would you do such a thing?
10,"One of the guards said he saw a mage appear out of thin air. Claimed it was one of those Psijic monks. Man's been hitting the skooma, I say."
11,"By the gods, you're diseased. Get yourself to the White Phial and purchase a remedy, before you infect us all!"
12,"Let's just say, my cousin's out fighting dragons, and what do I get? Guard duty."
13,"Yes, Dovahkiin? How can I help you?"
14,"Some advice, friend. That armor won't offer much protection in a real fight."
15,"Stormcloaks, Imperials, dragons. Ain't no matter...

Caught a case of Rockjoint, once. Bothela at the Hag's Cure fixed me right up."
16,We got a nickname for anyone who trifles with us guards here in Windhelmâ€”Suicide.
17,"You should unload some of that unwanted gear. Head over to Sadri's Used Wares, talk to the Elf."
18,I need to ask you to stop. That... shouting... is making people nervous.
19,Do you think the Republicans blockade of Merrick Garland is appropriate?
20,[Lolligags]
21,Don't suppose you'd enchant my sword? Dull old blade can barely cut butter.
22,"You've got a lot of nerve, walking around here dressed like an Imperial Legionnaire."
23,Let me guess... someone stole your sweetroll.
24,I didn't say that I thought all powers should be returned to the states. A core responsibility of the federal government should be enforce the civil rights detailed in the Constitution. That's not the type of thing we can leave to the states.
25,You see those warriors from Hammerfell? They've got curved swords. Curved. Swords.
26,The Thu'um! 
27,Oh shit this is the most amazing AMA ever.
28,"Thank you for your support. We are going to fight until the end, but if we do not win, Mindy Finn (my running mate) and my team believe that it's time for a new conservative movement that is dedicated to the equality and personal liberty of all Americans. We're already building that and what comes next isn't yet clear (perhaps a new party). Those are the things I think about most...it's possible that as a part of all of that, I would run again, but I'm just not sure yet."
29,"The best part is how your responses are random, like an NPC, rather than appropriate, given that a human at a keyboard could use their cognitive capabilities to enhance the interaction."
30,"Simply awesome.

One time I entered the town where I believe that you may be stationed. There was this *massive* dead dragon sprawled out, and it's body was going through a bridge.

Did this dragon attack your village? Did he slay anybody? Did you play a role in its demise? Please tell the details of this encounter. It was truly a sight to behold.

"
31,Will you please tell the pov camera guys to stfu??
32,"Sheathe those claws, Khajiit."
33,"It's no secret Aretino is doing some ritual, trying to call the Dark Brotherhood. But who's going to stop him? Me? I'll have no part of that."
34,"""Open your ass."""
35,"I support state rights. So if a state wants to legalize marijuana, it should have the right to do that. For the record, I don't think that's a particularly wise course of action and if my state were ever voting on that, I would vote against legalization. All that said, I support the states' right to decide."
36,The Winking Skeever's got warm beds and cold mead. You look like you could use both.
37,"Perfectly within your rights to hold such an opinion, but just FYI, as an independent voter (and Mormon, FWIW) , this doesn't seem like a conservative position to me, but a nakedly partisan and barely defensible one.  It is certainly not a position that conserves the tradition or likely intent of the constitution. 

If you feel the Senate should have rejected Garland as not sufficiently originalist, that's one thing. And I suppose opposition to a once Hatch-favored nominee is consistent with your speculated future bid for Hatch's seat. 

 But if you're on board with this new pulled-out-of-someone's-butt ""norm"" where the entire last year of an opposition presidency is somehow lame-duck territory, as far as I'm concerned, you forfeit the right to present yourself as some kind of antidote to what the political process is currently offering.  

Trump didn't happen in a vacuum. He's a natural outgrowth of a lot of stuff that the Republican party has been sowing for decades, and that's directly tied up with the recent refusal to have confirmation hearings and votes. Your strategic candidacy indicates you are (or someone associated with your campaign is) smart enough to know this. Do you want to just take advantage of yawning chasm that's opening up as a result? Or are you principled enough to offer people more than your own opportunity as an alternative?"
38,Don't think you'll get special treatment just because you have a house in the city...
39,[Hey](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/b/bb/Diamond_city_security_officer.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20151224102221). You that trader. Up from Quincy? You got any ointment... I got this itch.
40,"What would you do if the dragon born dressed up as a guard, killed the spoiled Battle-Born brat, and tried to frame you? "
41,Citizen.
42,"To the people saying the psychologist was incompetent, that is unfair to both the patient and the psychologist.  We know nothing about the veracity of the information being presented and we don't know the state of affairs of the communications in the office.

If the patient was ""fired"" it took a long time to happen and the psychologist may have tried everything they could.  In the end they could have kept seeing them and billing, or forced the patient to get a new view which may help.

The sheer fact of the matter is that if the patient doesn't actually want help, and the support structure isn't there around them (parents, friends, school, et. al) no amount of help is going to help.  

To the OP, if this is real, the way you have answered other questions makes it sound like this is a joke, either to your inner self or just in general. 

If this is real, you need to find a different group of people to be with.   Ones which will not accept your issues as something OK, but who will support and help you to change (this is the only reason AA works for some people). This process is not going to be easy, but like drug abuse and many other things it is best to cut the behavior and the bad support structure cold turkey and move on.

Take a look at what is going on and think about your affect on your own life and those around you, figure out how you want to create a positive influence and then WRITE DOWN a plan to get there.  Share it with your support structure and live by it.

Good luck!

BTW: you would have friends if you told them.  That's an insecure 16 year old's thought process.  I know it seems incredibly difficult and scary, but that just isn't how any of this works.  Admit you need help to people you trust and its pretty amazing what can happen.  
"
43,"As a Democrat and fervent supporter of Hillary Clinton, I really, sincerely do hope that you and other conservatives are able to create a party dedicated to those principles instead of the ones espoused by Trump, even knowing that if you do you'll probably siphon off Democratic voters. This country will work best with two robust parties who can have passionate but respectful disagreements about policies and ideals instead of the demagoguery that we're witnessing."
44,"Psst. Hey, I know who you are. Hail Sithis!"
45,"Bit late to be wandering around, isn't it?"
46,"So there's basically no positives. 

To me that sounds like someone saying ""yeah it was a great idea to cut off both of my arms at the shoulder! I never have to clean my nails anymore, washing your hands is a thing of the past, you can't break or sprain your hand or wrist, even your annoying funny bone is no longer an issue .""
"
47,"AMA over in less than 30 minutes.

I'm sure Trump will lob ""strength and stamina"" accusations your way very soon."
48,Why aren't you an adventurer like me? 
49,"You ask me? The brats in the orphanage are better off, now that she's dead."
50,Only burglars and vampires creep around after dark. So which are you?
51,Don't think you can barter with me like I'm one of those damned shopkeepers.
52,Uch. Been tending your hounds? You smell like a wet dog.
53,"STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM!"
54,"Go cast your fancy magic someplace else.
"
55,Would you ever feel grief if someone ate your desert? 
56,"Hey everyone, I'm very sorry, but I have to run to an TV interview. I'll try to come back later and address more questions. Thank you for them and for participating. Sorry, I couldn't stay longer right now. e
"
57,You're that one from the College. Heard about you.
58,"I got started for the worst and most naive reason possible: I was bored and thought that porn would be a fun way to make some extra spending money. It spiraled out of control and eventually became a full-time job, until I decided to quit and regain some normalcy in my life. 

I didn't know anyone in the industry starting out, so I made amateur films with local college girls who I recurited at bars and frat parties. (I was, at the time, a senior in college myself.)

I had a website (now defunct) where I published this content, and when I had accumulated enough videos, I submitted my work to a European porn producer via cold-call email. He saw potential and agreed to take me on as a director/producer at his company. I spent two years there, gradually taking on more responsibility until I eventually became the de-facto studio boss. My *actual* boss controlled the finances, but I did everything else. He spent most of his time drinking and trying to bang the models."
59,"It's a complicated crisis of course, but we must start by recognizing that Bashar al-Assad's industrial scale slaughter of Syrian civilians has created the environment in which ISIS is thriving in Syria and it has been the core cause of the refugee crisis as well. In response, I think we should work with the international community to support friendly regional forces on the ground, create safe zones in the north and south, and in doing so, weaken Assad on the battlefield. THEN, we should use that leverage to negotiate his departure from Syria. I also think we should paint the entire country with full-spectrum radar so that we can see exactly where and when Assad and the Russians are dropping bombs on civilians. Then I think we should publish that information for the world to see."
60,"Hello Evan. Thanks for getting the duck question out of the way--it's been on my mind for a long time.

My next question would be this: as much as I would personally love for you to win the election, if it should not happen, what would your political plans be going forward the next few years? Would you plan on running again in 2020? I think given the state of the GOP you would be seen as an immediate leading candidate.

Edit: Oh, I did have one more question. Why do you think people aren't focusing as much on your religion as they were on Romney when he ran?"
61,"Keep your arrows in their quiver, archer."
62,How did the arrow feel?
63,"Disrespect the law, and you disrespect me."
64,"Not usually. I won't say it never happened, but porn is a business and the vast majority of the models have no desire to sleep with the director."
65,"No, good sir. The beast was already dead prior to my entry into your hold. I beheld it for the first time upon entering.

I hold you and your colleagues in highest esteem. Never, *never* would I release such a beast to reek havoc.

Please, good sir. Inform me of thy noble deeds and the circumstances surrounding the vanquishing of this foul creature back to the abyss. "
66,"Have you heard? There's been another dragon attack. Kynesgrove, this time...

City got attacked once by those damned bandits, come east across the lake, from Faldar's Tooth. They won't be trying that again."
