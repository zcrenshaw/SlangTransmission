0,Isn't this your 3rd post about cutting off your nipple? If so are you continuously doing AMA's to fill the void where your nipple once was?
1,"So we're just ignoring the fact that he wrote physic instead of psychic?

Ok"
2,Why does my father beat me? 
3,How do you deal with unwanted pregnancies?
4,"Why the downvotes? Did I do something wrong?
"
5,This was funnier than I expected
6,"When will you realize you wrote ""physic"" instead of ""psychic?"""
7,Yes
8,"Hello?  Sorry, wrong thread.  Yes I'm fine."
9,How many people have seen you naked? 
10,How much is on your mom's life insurance policy?
11,"You say gross till we are reading the "" I married my twins bf ama"""
12,"Still waiting for that to happen! Though has definitely not been great being an identical twin when the twin's boyfriend sneaks up behind who he thinks is ""his twin"" to be cute and give neck kisses.

Gross."
13,I also predicted that you would say something
14,"No, people are just dicks. "
15,How did you spend childhood birthdays and holidays with family?
16,"I don't start things, I finnish them"
17,"Back where I come from, we used to just put them both in a box, tape it shut, shake it, and hope for the best."
18,"Elementary school, 2nd grade (could be 3rd?) my twin was having a hard time in her class with her teacher. My twin is less headstrong and assertive than I am and there are times where she and I switch to either give the situation with another person a more relaxed atmosphere or to make a point. Twin wanted to make a point with this teacher... in other words, she wanted me to be difficult for the teacher. So lunch we discussed it, went to the bathroom afterwards when our classes mutually stopped there (oh the time of single file lines) together, swapped clothes, came out, and split the reverse way. 

Teacher was a lot less arbitrarily forceful in the way she spoke to my twin after a few times of doing that. It was the first time we realized that our traits in various things could make us, as a unit, more well rounded"
19,"Yeah, it does worry me. A lot of people think of Cluster B personality disorders as inherently abusive. I told my friend right away and even though she knows me well she asked if I wanted to kill people. There's a LOT of stigma.

Curiously, my friends were blindsided but my parents were totally unsurprised. My dad told me he's always thought I have a total lack of empathy for other people. It hurts to hear things like that from your father, but three court-appointed psychiatrists all agree."
20,I think the website you are looking for is 4chan.
21,"Excellent questions. 

1.
She had several affairs. At first I played the chump. But eventually I put a stop to it. I even believe she dated a few women. Her demons are her demons. But I think when you have some serious secrets, you want to keep them safe. Part of it may have been she was worried I'd tell her homophobe parents about her bisexuality. And there's the kids. She said she'd die before she lost custody. The week after I was shot, I got custody. 

2.
I would marry again. But obviously not to her if I could relive my life. I've dated some. The past has taught me to see odd behavior. One girl I dated since has been diagnosed as bipolar. 

3.
The law is VERY biased. It would make your head spin how biased it is. One is she had to pay less child support (kinda understandable, but she got a job that paid more than I made). She got a free pass from paying child support for 6 months. When I paid it, they backdated it to the day we separated. Another is I couldn't get a restraining order in the county we lived in. Once I moved, that judge was way more reasonable. Child support treats men like scum. And social workers do too. "
22,OP didn't claim to be an English major.
23,"Best, for most practical reasons:

Twin needed to pass 300lvl foreign (other than English) language course to graduate college. But twin found out about this stipulation too close to the end of their college career because twin transferred colleges so many times. Twin speaks NO languages other than English but needed to pass this on-campus, 4 day a week, 4 hour a session summer language course so we switched. I speak a few languages so other than being time consuming and requiring some maneuvering to make the switch check out (twin wasn't ""multiple places at once"", it was easy!

Snag: there was a person in the class whom twin and I were close with that we had no idea was going to be in the class. It was shocking at first but everyone likes a good twin switch so not an issue "
24,"A kinkshaming party. We all sit around in a circle and share our kinks, then shame each other"
25,They said they can't prove his intent was to kill me. But they could prove he intended to assault me. The only difference is a possibility of a life sentence for attempted murder. 
26,"Worst:  Either talking a young father through CPR on his newborn that didn't make it OR a man shot himself on the phone with me last super bowl Sunday. 

BEST:  Had to be the man who called telling me to hurry and send the police it's a life or death emergency in a thick Russian accent.   The police informed me his horrible emergency was his neighbors dropping trash on his lawn.   He then called back asking for me specifically and proceeded to thank me so much and tell me how glad he was his tax dollars pay my salary lol. "
27,Some people eat the placenta from a new mother. I guess that could be considered as human meat.
28,Feel better man 
29,"From what I understand about psychology, psychopathy, despite the stigma, is not a static diagnosis - i.e., with therapy and cognitive changes, you don't have to always be a psychopath after your diagnosis(correct me if I'm wrong about this).
Do you think thinking about others' emotions and such is something you can teach yourself/learn to do better in the future now that you know your perception may be inaccurate?
Do you think your other diagnoses you mentioned play into the ASPD? I can see BPD being somewhat related from what I know about the two.

I like the way you talk about yourself, though, you seem very self-aware and intent on changing what you hadn't known you were doing wrong, I admire that :)"
30,"Dude, trust me. Do them all. Life's too short to be caught up in your own head. All of those things are good fun. Except heroin, don't do heroin."
31,"All-in-all, you shouldn't shave your nips like your balls."
32,My boyfriend is meeting his biological father for the first time tomorrow. What should I plan to make it a memorable day? 
33,**ITS TIME TO STOP** 
34,This lady once claimed that her downstairs neighbors we're breaking into her apartment using teleportation and trap doors through her closet to burn her with lasers and sexually assault with various types of fruits and vegetables as she slept. 
35,It's true! Any PD diagnosis can be removed after a period of remission. I am using CBT and DBT as well as psychotherapy to try and fix my life. I do think the BPD complicates things quite a lot. It's kinda funny--sometimes I think I'm amazingly attractive and intelligent and sometimes I hate myself and want to die.
36,Your either the kind of person that pees in the shower or your the kind of person that lies 
37,Multiple every single day.   Mostly kids that don't know what they're doing or teenagers that don't realize caller ID and GPS exist.  
38,Hey! Razor! Leave the nips alone!
39,"My wife did it. She also kept some of it in the fridge for a while until it began to stink and then we threw it away. She had some woman take it away, put it through some food processor, and turn it into pills. I thought the whole thing was disgusting."
40,"Hey, that was a pretty great video!"
41,How did it feel when you ran over that kitten?
42,"lol, I had to pay taxes on it too.

The government charged me to jack off lol."
43,"Went through a bit of this when my wife died.  I resolved to not drink alone.  Even if I knew no one at whatever bar/restaurant I'd end up at, I'd at least have a chance of meeting people."
44,"She served a year for the identity theft. She passed away 3 years ago. Cause unknown. 
I don't have a restraining order, but I'm sure a part of his parole is that he not come near me. But I will have cameras, guns, and an alarm system. 
I've been to a lot of counseling. Almost lost it once when she stole my identity. It's been a roller-coaster for sure. "
45,"When you've been through 9 months of a pregnancy and a birth, the definition of ""disgusting"" is altered forever. *Forever*. "
46,I hate the trend baby names are taking
47,"Hell, I've been - quite literally - just flushing money down the toilet for the past 25 years!!"
48,"For the better.

For all of my life, I've been dealing with getting into fights, addiction to self harm and illegal drugs, being arrested multiple times, nearly getting kicked out of schools because of constant rule-breaking, and having all my relationships go bad because I just didn't care about their feelings or desires.

I didn't know what I was doing wrong, and I looked down upon others for being too stupid/selfish/boring/ignorant/crazy to make things work for me. I was completely self-righteous and blind to my own wrongdoing.

Now I have a name for it. I can remind myself that my perceptions may not always be accurate. I can use coping skills to deal with urges and uncomfortable feelings. I can accept when people tell me I'm being a self-centered asshole because I know that's all part of this. I know that this is not who I have to be. It's just an illness that I can recover from."
49,Are you switching responses even during this AMA?
50,How the hell did he shoot you and only get charged assault 1 and not attempted murder?! That's lunacy
51,Because I'm retarded.
52,"twice a week. 

Be at least 5 foot 10 inches

Have a college degree.

Have supersperm, (this ones a bitch) only 20% of the male population have sperm tenacious enough to deal with long term freezing.

Be ""good looking"""
53,This is like reverse cards against humanity 
54,"Technically, anyone. Well, except for your second cousin who's in jail "
