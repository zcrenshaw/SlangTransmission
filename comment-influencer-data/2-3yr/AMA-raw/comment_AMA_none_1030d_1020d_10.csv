0,Before or after my trip there?
1,"Are you planning on going a TED talk? If recommend it, I'd love to hear more. "
2,"Four things:

- From what I've seen/read/heard, the racism of many Trump supporters, including top-level advisors (Steve Bannon comes to mind) and yes, the candidate himself, went waaaaay further than just demanding the strict application of existing immigration laws (which I don't see as racist in and by itself).

- The visa system is FUBAR. I didn't write ""not generous enough"" (or ""too generous""), but fcuked up. Whether you want to welcome the world or pull up the drawbridge, the current system cannot possibly be your system of choice. Ridiculously administrative, expensive, mind-numbingly stupid in its processes and highly ineffective in actually keeping the bad guys out whilst turning away talented people you need and (should) want.

- Applying current immigration laws is already done to a much larger extent than people realize. There isn't much to be gained on the illegal-border-crossing front. ""Protecting"" a 5,000 mile desert is very very expensive and not really feasible, Trump's wall (which he is already pivoting away from) notwithstanding. The real problem is visa-overstaying. 

- Kicking out illegal immigrants who have lived here for a while is a logistic and civil-rights nightmare. This is what gets me really angry. To those who want to expel ""all illegals"", you have no idea what damage you'd be doing to your own country. You basically need the Gestapo knocking on doors and massive racial profiling for this to work. You'd be breaking up families (kids are usually citizens) that are a threat to no one and who scrupulously abide by all laws (except for their immigration status). They will be protected by their churches, their communities. Do you really want to start raiding schools and churches and rip society apart in CA, NM and AZ? Because that's what it would take. That and billions of dollars (the Gestapo needs to be paid). And all that for what? Kick out the criminals, by all means, see if I care. But regular folks who fled poverty twenty years ago and have been productive members of society since then? Come on, surely there are more urgent issues in the US

EDIT: seriously, downvotes? WTF, this wasn't some anti-Trump screed, I just gave my opinion and tried to motivate it.  Jeeeez.
"
3,"The cops come out here about once a week for a disturbance. Generally for a spat between couples.

One of our long term guests who's on disability loved his hookers. He came running to the office to ask for help. In his room was a hooker overdosing, a one legged hooker. By the time I got off the phone with 911 she had died, and he was laying with her crying. He hid her prosthetic leg in the bathroom and still has it to do this day. "
4,"I was going to upvote, but I don't want to mess up your average of 3. "
5,I can't even tell. Must not be that bad. 
6,"Don't lie, was is USB-C? Otherwise I'm gonna need to see some serious verification."
7,How many virgins do you suppose are in the Virgin Islands?
8,"Well I dont want to be a warehouse worker so i go for a low grade office job. I dont have a rust bucket but i drive a nissan altima. I listen to Eminem to make me think I can break free. I dont make too much but im not broke. My wife is a solid 4. my kids are getting cs in school. our house color is snowstorm. I drink pepsi. I know more about harry potter than the next muggle. I only do bondage on school nights. The kids like their cereal and play cops and robbers with the hand cuffs, They're going to cornell. Hopefully. Probably sinclair. I go 3 miles over the speed limit. I like the adrenaline when going by cops."
9,you deserved to win that lottery with wit like that.
10,How did it feel like going in?
11,"Tossed them in the dumpster because they were expired. Otherwise I would have offered them to other guests.

Once a month I get some bins full of fruit and vegetables and hand them out trying to help them at least eat a bit healthy. Nobody cares about these people, someone sort of has to."
12,Id appreciate that average going to 4
13,"This super fat guy moved out, and on his bed was a giant pile of human shit. It's almost as if he was saving it up for this very occasion.  

Tied for second would be a mannequin head with a few wigs, used and battered in a sexual manner of course. 

Third would be closet full of boxes of crackers. Stacked from the floor to the ceiling, unopened, nothing but crackers in closet."
14,Nice humble brag - I mean - question
15,Okay cool.
16,"He drives around with it in his ""souped-up"" PT Cruiser.  His brother stayed here for a while as well and was accused of staring at the leg too much. The brother moved out because of ""foot steps on the ceiling   and ""loud noises from the basement"". There isn't a basement."
17,"I first read that as ""abortionist""... "
18,Well before he got there: X number of virgins. AFTER he got there X number of virgins + 1. 
19,You're supposed to ask a question.
20,"Yes twice. First time I rented a room to a guy in his 20's, he seemed normal, everything was fine the first night. I forgot to tell him no smoking in the rooms. So I went and knocked on his door just to remind him and bring him his ""starter kit"" (which consisted of a roll of toilet paper and a magnet with a delivery service guys number on it), and he told me I better fuck off and never knock on his door again or he's going to ""kill me by dropping bombs on my head and nuke me into the sky from his helicopter"". 

The second time a guy and a girl were arguing and she was standing in the door way as he was tossing all the furniture into the parking lot. I walked over and just as I got there he looked at me and threw a haymaker at his girlfriend punching her square in the face who was standing in the doorway and knocked her on her ass into the parking lot. I had to call the cops and they had tased him which seemed to have no affect and took them both away.

At the time I didn't know they were not allowed to be near each other from a court order, by me calling the cops they both ended up in jail and she lost her job across the street, I thought they were both going to come back and beat the living shit out of me or stab me.

But hey I'm still here."
21,"One of my highest rated comments is just the word ""yes""."
22,#that's what she said
23,I feel his pain.  One legged hookers are really hard to find these days.
24,"Not exactly, it's more of a feeling of companionship "
25,"As a psychology student who is particularly interested in psychopathy, I'd be curious to know: have you ever done anything that caused a great deal of harm or pain to another without realizing it at the time? If so, how did you make amends(if at all)?    
What would you say is the biggest difficulty you experience in interacting with other people on a day-to-day basis?   
Thanks for your time."
26,How often do the cops have to come there? What's the craziest thing you have seen? 
27,"1) Yeah. I mentioned this earlier, but one time my friend told me that her dog died and I just replied with ""okay thanks"". I didn't realize it for a while, but she understood since she knew about my disorder. 
2) The biggest difficulty for me is trying to talk without overthinking my response or not thinking about it all. "
28,No. People have opinions and I can acknowledge that. 
29,daaammmnnn son!
30,"It's this really that rare? All of my kids have this combo. I knew it probably wasn't common, but it's really the rarest? 

Nina edit fastest=rarest"
31,You ever mix the two up?
32,I guess the education sistum was wrong. We dont need good grammer. 
33,Who knew a cashiering degree was so expensive?
34,"Wait,  you had sex with pizza?? "
35,"I'm not sure. I do feel some love at times, but only towards people that I know well like my family or close friends. Don't get me wrong, it takes a lot for me to actually feel that love and it's usually only if they do something nice for me."
36,Upvote the main post and downvote all his comments?
37,Okay thanks 
38,No question. Prior AF Staff Sergeant here. Just saying good luck!
39,"What are you, some kind of fucking wizard?"
40,"No, I do not want them to feel bad for me, but to rather understand what my condition entails and how this affects my interactions with others. I would prefer that people wouldn't hate me, but it is a given especially with those who are ignorant. "
41,"&gt; ""Protecting"" a 5,000 mile desert is very very expensive and not really feasible,

Just a little caveat, the U.S. - Canadian border is around 5,000 miles, but the U.S. - Mexican border is a little less than 2000 miles."
42,I don't think he exists 
43,"You can now, back then you couldn't. I can post a picture of one of the rooms tomorrow, as to why you shouldn't smoke in them. Cigarette burns on the floor, walls, even the microwave. Hell one guy used the mini fridge freezer as the ashtray.

Edit * Took the pictures now. :) http://imgur.com/a/0shoz This guy with aids just moved out."
44,Not really but I have done both on the same day several times.
45,"yes
Edit: I didn't expect this to work"
46,"My roommate has a $2,000,000 face (or so they say).  He was in a horrible motorcycle accident, should really be dead.  I might be able to see if he wants to answer a few questions."
47,"Yeah, I feel nothing. "
48,"They won't unless you actually know a cabbie (most cab drivers do not want to exit their vehicle no matter what) and request them by name. However, all delivery services will delivery pretty much anything, literally. In the summer I personally get slurpees delivered for me, or some fast food.

There is an Indian Reserve very very close, and these delivery services come here almost daily dropping off cartons of smokes and bottles of booze.

Best bet is to find a delivery service, and don't forget to tell your friend to tip so they come back. :)"
49,"After I've left, X - 1/2 (don't ask)  "
50,"We don't even supply towels anymore, for this reason."
51,This one. You make me proud
52,Shia Labeouf?
53,"Thanks, Nina."
54,"The guy with aids that just moved out wanted to move back in and sleep in storage until the end of the month when he has rent money again.

One of the prostitutes has an e-bike that's not working very well so she asked if I could put it in my trunk and drive her downtown so she could pawn it, this was at like 3am.

The little old lady who has been here longer than I has asked me to look at her thighs to check on her sores. (have not will not)"
55,"Wouldn't you want to know. 

Thanks!

Semi-serious answer: there are soooo many weak points in the visa system .... The only people who get turned down are the poor schmucks who play by the rules. I am truly convinced a well-funded terrorist with some decent legal advice could get in legally without the slightest hint of trouble. I take no joy nor comfort in that thought."
56,"&gt; His brother stayed here for a while as well and was accused of staring at the leg too much.

Sibling rivalries never end.  This is such a wonderfully fucked up comment.  Not quite r/jesuschristreddit material, but definitely up there."
57,"I have red hair, blue eyes, and I am left handed. Its fine. "
58,"skuzmier God damnit. i'm...LOOKING for a user! you got my hopes up when I saw the notification, now the door's back over there and please don't come back unless you bring a FO.com user. "
59,"have you ever had to visit a regular who would no longer be buying pizza.

aka picking up the customer instead of dropping something off."
60,You just assess your worth through meditation. Or hit karma breakdown. Either way.
61,"Congrats! What's your insight on people being ""racist"" if they want immigration laws better policed? If you decline to answer, I completely understand."
62,"Generally the start off with a bang. Night traffic accidents, people sick after work. Then theres usually a little lull then all the weirdos and more violent crimes. Then usually around 5-6am the heart attacks come in. "
63,Have you considered a career in politics?
64,"Movies and books must suck for you, huh."
65,What were your hopes and dreams as a child?
66,[deleted]
67,Does it make you mad when people downvote your reddit comments? 
68,"No, he's real. Just like Trump University or his tax returns."
69,"I am the manager. The owners (without trying to sound racist), were East Indian and Pakistani, and so are generally kind of cheap. They just don't put money in unless they have to, ie a flood, a fire, and take months to pay their bills. I just convinced the new owner to bring in WiFi.

edit* spelling"
70,"This is perhaps one of the most ignorant replies I've ever seen on an AMA. You clearly have absolutely no understanding of psychopathy or what a sociopath even is. Your post is the equivalent of telling somebody with extreme depression that it's impossible for them to not be happy and that they should ""just cheer up and stop being sad.""     
    

Shaking my god damn head over here."
71,What's the weirdest thing you have found in a room?
72,Do you prefer for people to try to guess/finish your sentences for you when you're stuck on a stutter or just wait it out for you to get there on your own?
73,"Yes, her day job was at IHOP."
74,[deleted]
75,Can't smoke in the rooms?  Clearly not seedy enough.
76,Is it just because it's the internet that makes it OK to be a dick?  
77,Nah
78,*Hot single sheep looking to hook up in your area now!*
79,What's it like being a filthy liar?
80,No. I'm a cashier making $11 dollars an hour. I make around 12k a year after taxes. 
81,"I once made a spelling mistake on a game sub reddit that has earned me 120+ karma,what's your opinion?
Edit: turns out its 169"
82,ok... why?
