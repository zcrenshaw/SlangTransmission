0,"The actual gas station was somewhat of a blur. I remember the cashier telling the police that they didn't know at all what was wrong but to come. And they kept offering me an ICEE and something to eat. I was so afraid that they were going to find me before the police arrived that the thought of eating made me nauseous....The police officers were extremely tactful in what they did. (My mom is helping me to recollect these memories as some are fuzzy.) When they arrived at the gas station, it was obvious that he recognized me. He immediately called someone and requested backup. After a long conversation with me..... I told him anything and everything I could remember from the past 17 days. He then brought me to the police station, and my parents were there waiting for me. They and my brother cried and cried and we hugged for a long time. It was a typical reunion in this kind of situation. Then, because they did not want to lose any time, they began questioning me. It was not scary, and it was even somewhat comforting. I was there for probably about 5 or 6 hours. I gave them as much information as humanly possible, then they drew a sketch of the man and woman...but this did not really look like them. Anyway, I thought that I would spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder waiting for them to find me. Well after a few weeks of no responses, I was getting back into school, going to therapy every day, and trying to adjust to regular life. My mom picked me up one day and told me not to be scared but we were going to the police station. Once we got there, they brought me into the lineup room, and there he was. The man who pretended to be my father for 17 days. I don't even remember that there were other people there, but I knew it was him. At that point in time all I could do was tell them that it was indeed him, and from what my mother tells me, he outted the woman in hopes that he would have a lessened sentence. He was caught attempting to kidnap another child. Another 10 year old, but this time it was a little boy, and he was trying to lure him away from a batting cage while his dad had walked inside to get more balls. When he tried to take the boy, it just so happened that the father had turned around (not sure why) but realized what was happening, and he stopped the kidnapping and managed to pin down the man. For the next year of my life we were in court, giving testimonies, meeting lawyers, and going to therapy. It was awful...... But over time ( I am now 24 years old) I learned to deal with it. I still go to therapy once a week, I am on an antidepressant each day, and I take Xanax to help me sleep at night. I was having terrible nightmares there for a while. As far as any other major ways this has changed my life, I have managed to stay pretty normal. I graduated high school with honors, played 4 sports throughout high school, went on to graduate from LSU with a degree in teaching, although I now work for social services, and I got married last year, and now have a 4 month old baby."
1,Sounds like you're quite the entreporneur.
2,Nice try. You suck at your job and it's only a matter of time before everyone figures out that you're a complete fraud.
3,"On my first night in the house, we had a nice, proper meal. We sat at the dinner table, each with a plate with mashed potatoes, meat loaf, corn, and a piece of bread. I drank milk, and the couple each had some wine. Sounds nice, right? No. Both of my feet were hand cuffed to the legs on the chair. I also had some kind of rope like security around my chest that wrapped around the chair. I didn't want to eat because I was physically sick from the trauma of the day..... When I refused to eat, I was slapped across the face. I was also told I couldn't be released from the table unless my plate was completely empty. A few slaps and lots of tears later, I had force fed myself everything off of my plate. Then, I was forced to eat some kind of dessert. I don't remember what it was, but we did find out after the trial that they were putting sedatives in my supper to ensure I didn't have much mobility in the night, which didn't matter because I was handcuffed by my right foot to the bed each night.
I have more stories if y'all would like more... 
This is probably the scariest part of what happened. The reason that the couple couldn't adopt is because the man was a registered sex offender. He had 8 counts of aggravated rape of a 9 year old girl. This was especially frightening because I was a 10 year old girl. As far as ""did the man touch me?"" I don't really remember. I think he did in my sedated state, as I remember (very vaguely) being hand cuffed to the bed and him stroking my thigh, and mentioning something about development. But that's about all I remember. The mother also couldn't adopt (aside from the fact that she was married to a sex offender) because she also had a criminal record.... She had two counts of attempt of kidnapping. I can expand on both of their pasts some more if y'all want. 
"
4,"They were each sentenced to between 60-80 years in prison with no chance of parole, because of the previous crimes they had committed. 
"
5,"I think because I was so young I didn't really grasp the concept of the idea that they would kill me. I think I was more afraid that I would never be able to go back to a normal life. I missed my parents and my brother so much. The majority of the time I just kept thinking to myself, ""I can not live like this forever. This is not real life."" When I think back on it, I would compare it to the Truman Show. It also felt like I was dreaming. Its so scary now that I am older and know what could have happened. "
6,"Hey, it's been a whole five minutes since we last spoke, how's it going?"
7,Because there are no lions chasing you and I need the work. 
8,"You said you never harmed a children, but isn't viewing child pornography harmful to children? By viewing it, you are the contributing to the demand for it. I consider that very harmful to the future children who will be used for pornography, because of people like yourself who view it.

eta...you said that you're attracted to women your age. Do you intend on having children in the future?
"
9,That it is a pyramid scheme like no one has ever seen before.
10,This is one of the most interesting amas I've read in a very long time. Did ever feel seriously scared for your own life?
11,Well then at this rate there's further to home than my life expectancy
12,She would like you to stop being so goddamn needy. See if they have that at Jared's.
13,"As far as kidnapping others goes, there was never any evidence that proved that they had before me. I didn't really know much about what was going on during the trial because of my young age, but as I have gotten older and now that I am an adult, I have looked into the files and talked with my mother about it during therapy, and have found that finding out all the hairy details have actually helped the healing process. These are some things I found out about the couple. 

I recently found out some details of the couple who did this to me. 

The man grew up in Georgia, where he was molested by his step father for the majority of his life. Aside from the molestation, he seemed to have had a normal life. He went to a private school up until college, and then graduated from a public Georgia college. After college, he married someone who already had a child, and they seemed to live a normal life until (I'm not sure how they found out) the mother found out that after 7 years of marriage (they married when her little girl from a previous relationship was 2).....Anyway, when the little girl was 9, they found out that he had been raping her repeatedly. They only got him on 8 counts of rape. His then wife divorced him and pressed charges. He did around 15 years in prison, where he met his wife.... they met through mail..... I'm not sure the details, but I think she had some kind of fetish with men behind bars. Anyway, when he was released from prison, they got married.

The woman actually lived an extremely normal life. She was from Florida (I think) and all I know about her is that she had a still born baby and they think that is what led her to kidnapping. She had 2 counts of attempt at kidnapping in her life, and she also spent sometime in prison. I am not sure how long or where.

As far as eating habits go, I struggled with anorexia, bulimia, and extreme binge eating from 7th grade and still struggle now. I am learning now that that was a combination of trying to have complete control over what was happening to me, as well as some extreme body dimorphic disorder. I am still a tad chubby because I have seriously screwed up my metabolism, but I don't struggle as bad with food as I used to. 

Relationships have been hard. I experimented with girls in college. That was more trouble than it was worth. After that, I completely took myself out of the dating scene. I decided that I wouldn't be able to get hurt if I didn't expose myself to anyone. That was extremely lonely, and about 3 years ago, I met someone through work, and reluctantly started dating, and he helps with my panic attacks and nightmares, and we actually got married last year and have a little baby 4 month old!"
14,"No do not have children. I'm sorry man, I'm sure you want to, but you should not."
15,"Blow it off. You buckle under pressure anyway. Don't try to ""improve"" yourself. "
16,"Holyâ€¦ wow. Please tell us more when you can OP. This is a, wow. You sure went through hell. It's good to hear a story have an ending where they didn't get away with it. Too many stories like that now a days "
17,Good. I'm stronger when you're alone
18,"I came to do my own AMA as a sexual abuse survivor and I saw your post.

No question here, but it's a huge relief to see that you have not harmed a child.  I'd like to tell you that the abuse I went through when I was 12 years old at the hands of a 40 year old man nearly caused me to take my own life.  I sincerely hope you can try to seek out help for your problem before you hurt someone and cause them the same pain that has affected me and many other children.

"
19,It was about 3 hours (187 miles) away from the mall that I was at. 
20,You and me both. 
21,What was the sentences given to the kidnappers?

23,"Like gay camps that ""rehabilitate"" you to turn straight?

My mom has a friend who was sent to one as a kid and grew to love going every summer... turns out he was fucking one of the (male) counselors."
24,"Do you know a mulatto? A mosquito ? How's your libido? Hey hey hey?

"
25,I love the weed. Keep smoking it. And keep pontificating on your theories of Mr. Robot and Mullholland Drive. It's amusing to me.
26,"What age group are you most affected by? 

I had a friend that was found with thousands of images on his computer of child pornography. It was awful, and no one would have ever expected it from him. The worst was how well he was seen by the community for his interactions with children and how involved he was with kids sporting groups and such. He has never acted on his urges (or so he says, and no one has come forward). Anywho.. What struck me the hardest was that his images were of INFANTS and TODDLERS. How can someone find it in their will to see a child in this way? "
27,"Yeh I as kinda upset but I understand why she did it, she was very young (18) and not sure who the dad was, as time went on and she realised it was me it became harder to tell me. 

I came from a broken home so I decided no use in been angry and me and the mum have picked up as friends, in fact we are getting on really well. I want my son to see his parents like this, not the way I saw mine."
28, The average humanwalking speedÂ is about 5.0 kilometres per hour
29,"Hi, interesting questions. 

Basically I was arrested for a single image that traced my ip address. I did not create that image and was not distributing it. 

I discovered in my teen years, I initially justified it as I was ""into people my own age"" and then realised that it was not normal as I got older. 

I didn't turn myself in and wouldn't have done as it would mean I would lose my job and being an ""out"" pedophile is essentially voulenteering for social exclusion. 

I also am certain that I would never act out against a child. "
30,Do you have any specific questions? I will end up writing a book if I just start telling stories.... which would be okay with me....lol.... just don't want to overload things
31,Thanks for keeping me grounded. Much love.
32,"To say it with Homer Simpsons words:       
""I have three kids and no money, why can't I have no kids and three money?"""
33,Lots of parents did in high school. Actually lost a few friends because of it. Not anymore tho. 
34,Turns out when you put all the gay kids together you get different results than a transformation to heterosexuality.
35,"Yeah, ive seen those kind of images... They make me sick too... Personally I am more impacted by females from around 11+ I think the thing that draws me towards them is the innocence and purity that I can see. It is not purely a sexual attraction but there is an element of that. "
36,How is Albania doing these days? What's the economic outlook? Is it impacted by Brexit?
37,What fact about Scientology do you feel everybody should know?
38,"Send a message when you get home, alright?"
39,Glad they won't see the outside world again.
40,"Damn you for making me cry at work. I'm so glad you escaped, I wish you all the best. *Internet hug*"
41,"Typically I get kids complaining of headaches or stomach aches who are happy as a clam when they come into my clinic.
I had one kid who told teacher they weren't feeling well and when I started asking them questions they flat out said with an exacerbated sigh, ""I'm just having a bad day and I miss mom."" "
42,"I'm not sure if you have been asked this yet, but how far away did they actually take you? You said that it felt like 5 hours or so"
43,"Mind blowing, when his mum told me that he'd asked about me 2 years earlier and decided to leave it when he saw I was married it gut punched me, I was in bits. To be honest I'm still getting used to it."
44,What happened after the gas station? How did your parents react? How has that effected you today? 
45,"I never became complaint, but only because I was only there for 17 days. Now that I am older, I can totally see how eventually, like maybe 6 months or a year later I would have eventually gotten used to it. They were extremely brain washy people and I could even see myself almost forgetting the live that I had before. 

They were each sentenced to between 60-80 years in prison with no chance of parole, because of the previous crimes they had committed. I have not kept up with them, but I do know that my brother does know stuff about them.... I don't ask, but I may someday. 

I am extremely over protective of my son. He does not go to day care, and he stays with his grandmother every day until I get off of work each day. I am slowly going to figure it out though because he will have to go to school at some point. "
46,"I'm married to a woman called Amy (also my baby mamma name, I sense a trend) we are working through some stuff, honestly at this point I'm not sure if we will make it as she always wanted kids and I don't. Giving her a kid now would feel wrong. I hope we can work things out."
47,What was it like discovering you had a son?
48,"As a rape survivor from 6 to 9 yo. I want to thank you for coming out. I have heard only 2-5% of sexual abusers of children admit their wrong-doing. It takes a lot of courage. We know that conversation therapy does not work to make people ""ex-gay"". 

What type of treatment do you think would support people expiencing what you are lead a healthier/ less harming others life. 

Also, have you told your family? How have they reacted?

Do you engage in or avoid drinking or drugs to attempt control over this? (fyi usually causes more peoblems than solves. But would understand if you use them in an attempt to cope.)

Finally have you been attracted to adults? How has dating been?

I really wish the best for you."
49,I would like to travel there one day... but there are some problematic misconceptions about the level of magic of my body parts.
50,tell us more
51,That's not even remotely close to the same thing as being a pedophile. 
52,Well this will be hard for you. So did you act on your urges were you able to contain yourself somehow? Why have you been arrested? How did you become one? Did you thought about turning yourself in because you didnt want to hurt anyone?
53,Thankyou for your bravery and I mean this really sincerely that I am truly sorry for what has happened to you. It is dreadful that this kind of thing happens and I hope that society on the whole can work to prevent things like this rather than simply focus on responding. If you want to talk feel free to pm me
54,"Easy there, he's doing an honest AMA and responding to the questions truthfully. It's okay to not agree with what he's saying, but do so in a professional and non-aggressive way. "
55,"Yeah I heard about that. Frontal lobe damage is often associated with that and I had the sutures in my forehead fused when I was born so I sometimes suspect that it might be involved.

Given an option I would go to quite a long way to have this fixed I'd happily have brain surgery but would rather not have anything done to my nuts. 

Unfortunately I think for most that this is an orientation and that kind of thing can't really be fixed. I feel that it would be best if support and accountability and for some supervision was offered. "
56,"He's not passing off the blam**e** to ""not being able to help himself."" I *think* he knows that it's not morally okay to act on the urges. He even mentions accountability.  What I think he's saying Is you can't just control what you're attracted to. For oversimplification, which you apparently need, I can't just make yellow my favorite color because I want to. "
57,Justin Bieber was playing over the PA.
58,"YES! I tried to get a job at a chiropractor's office and I was hired as the new office manager on the condition that I attend training in their main center in Florida for 3 months. I lived in virginia and that's where the office was located. The training was centered around their personal and business philosophy and I was expected to basically memorize Hubbard's Dianetics. I had an 18 month old and they wanted me to find a sitter for 3 months and embrace their ""philosophy"" in my personal life as well as the office. Also, a part of my salary I'd be losing to donate back to the training fund for future employees at other places and the more I recruited the more I could earn. I thanked them for the offer and got the hell out of there."
59,I'm gonna need to see these sites to verify many important scientific things. Strictly business.
60,That's not a question.
61,Ha ha now yet but I have started giving him Â£5 quid a week. He will owe me for fathers days and birthday if he pulls that.
62,Hello fellow
63,"no questions.

glad it didn't kill you and hope you stay clean"
64,Why are you ruining my marriage?
65,"I was exploited by individuals who took photos and videos of me as a child.

My abuse won't end because people watch me and see me every day. The abuse is constantly happening. By you looking at those videos and photos you are hurting me. You are exploiting whoever you are looking at by doing it without consent and objectifying them. "
66,Why does weed get rid of you so well?
67,"She joined officially I believe in 1990. She met a man who was member and he convinced her to join and move to FL. Which isn't a stretch because she does whatever a man tells her to do. 

I think the worst I saw was a woman up and left the church. And for weeks other members including my mom were told to visit her daily and bring her back. They would call her stop by her house and harass her daily. 

The worst I heard about (directly) was a member was stealing hundreds if not thousands of dollars from people. Something with how he was billing them for services. He wasn't fired or anything they just said stop doing that, and put him In a different job in the church. 

I have heard a lot of rumors but I can't verify them because of how much they cover stuff up. "
68,No. I tried to understand those beliefs but there were to many red flags. Unfortunately I had to fake it for a number of years because I had no other option. My mother only let me be friends with Scientologist. And those kids do far more drugs and bad things then most kids. 
69,I'll come in the form of an aneurysm. Sleep tight.
