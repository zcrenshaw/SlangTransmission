0,Update: I've left the lab
1,"The sheer amount of hand wringing you're doing is just insane.  For one, you're either a.) Not actually *trying* or b.) Outright lying.  

&gt; She majored in a STEM field but needs a masters degree to really have any shot of getting a job

See, that's funny to me, because ***I have no degree.*** My highest level of education is high school.  But I continued to self-study, and become very skilled.  In other words, I worked hard.  I now make a healthy six figures. and have absolutely no problem getting hired.  I've been at my newest job now for over a year and continue to have recruiters pinging me.  So... Well... Bullshit.

&gt; Sadly, post 2008 graduate, it was impossible to find a job in her field without even more education. 

See above.

&gt; The types of jobs she could get were 10-14$ at most. At the time it was impossible to even pay the minimum amount...

Wait... So you're saying... fresh out of college with no experience... That she *might have to start a job at ground level, but well above minimum wage?!?!*  SAY IT AIN'T SO?!  They aren't willing to pay her senior/management wages out the gate?!?!  HOW DARE THEY!    

Seriously, you have no excuse."
2,"No, it's CREDIBLE. I thought we established this already."
3,Sounds like you had a blast.
4,"Do you have any moral regrets, like maybe we should stand by our word to pay back that which we willingly borrowed?"
5,You do know there's literally a 13000 user subreddit dedicated to this topic right? https://www.reddit.com/r/PaidForWinRAR/ . One of the oldest Winrar jokes in the books.
6,"Thanks for sharing this. People often don't realize how serious of an issue female on male molestation/rape is and are too willing to dismiss it. Sharing your story, difficult as it may be, helps others to realize that this is a thing that happens to people and it does cause harm."
7,Apparently they found what seemed to be bombs
8,Don't judge me but pineapple and ham
9,"Your wife CHOSE to get finance for not one but two degrees.. Why should others have to pay for her poor decision? 

How do you feel about screwing the next generation who will find it even harder to finance studies because people like you fail to repay a debt they knowingly incurred?

11,I had some homemade alfredo last night. This morning I just had a clif bar and some cashews 
12,You rang?
13,As someone who currently pays 1400 monthly to my 3 loan companies- f you guys. Refinance or something to get a lower rate or lower the monthly payment. You are so entitled. 
14,"&gt; She majored in a STEM field but needs a masters degree to really have any shot of getting a job

I smell bullshit.  
"
15,Did you leave the lab with dignity?
16,What did you eat?
17,You asked for money to pay for something you got and promised to pay it back. Why do you feel like you shouldn't have to repay? 
18,I do not like them sam I am
19,[deleted]
20,"what makes it ""Credible"""
21,"I had that same job in college -- 37 years ago.  Video games were Asteroids, Missile Command, Crazy Climber and Pong."
22,Minimum wage
23,Those guys are assholes.
24,"Be the first to leave the lab or the first to have explosive diarrhea all over the lab. Tough choice, friend."
25,That was the joke hombre
26,"Lol....I've got a ton of doctors on my case. But no unfortunately none of them were hot. But I had my very ""hot"" husband next to me the whole time. "
27,They apologize after.
28,"What has been harder, living on the run or living month to month paying it back?

What did your wife major in? "
29,"&gt; How did it feel?

It felt oddly liberating. I had used WinRAR for almost 7 years prior to buying a license and just wanted to pay it back with a $29 license purchase.

&gt; What happened next?

The nag screen disappeared when I opened RAR files from then on.

&gt; How does it feel to be called an urban legend?

I don't think people call me an urban legend, at least not yet anyway."
30,Not to mention why not be born before the 2008 economic crash and when school was cheap and outsourcing and h1b visas weren't a thing?
31,"Do you suspect that soon you will be ""shitting in a college physics lab""?
"
32,"I'm cool with their choice to ditch; no one should pay that much for an education and there's no benefit to studying in order to get a great job to then be fucked over by repayments.

There needs to be a cap on what private institutions can charge for higher education as the increase in the cost of university over the last couple of decades grossly outpaces national inflation. 

It's close to the point where people can hardly afford it anyway. "
33,"Filipinas will steal your heart and eat your fucking soul. 

Good luck. "
34,Didn't realize gay porn paid so well
35,It helps a HUGE amount. But I don't pursue the women that hit on me often.
36,No. but high students come in daily
37,[deleted]
38,"I think both are hard/easy for different reasons. Living month to month was very hard because we lived in a very expensive city; easier in ways to have a good social life because of the stability of being in one place. Now that we're on the run, it is much easier to pay for the required things in life (minus the loans) and actually save money. It is harder because we frequently need to move in order to stay ahead of the debt collectors. Overall, for us, this decision is the best one that has worked. 

She majored in a STEM field but needs a masters degree to really have any shot of getting a job. Due to the very competitive nature of the program, and failing the GRE multiple times, she has no shot. She has essentially a very worthless degree. "
39,Fantastic. They come as gummys now. Hows busting your ass and hoping for a half day off going?
40,"Thank you for the kind words.  THis is exactly why I am trying to bring light to the situation, even on a small scale.  Being an adult, I can acknowledge the difficulties ive endured, and will continue to endure.

Its important for everyone to realize that once it happens the persons childhood has been taken away from them.  For me, it went from thinking about toy cars and toy soldiers to thinking about boobies and why I was erect while in 2nd grade class.  makes me sick thinking about it."
41,I sure hope not. There's a lot of attractive ladies here and I'd rather that they not see me shit myself 
42,"&gt;  twinsies!

I think you just got friendzoned. "
43,Probably. That and the image of your mom's beat up wizard sleeves have probably turned me away From pussy for life
44,What kind of toppings do you like on your pizza?
45,"Buy something called an OBD2 scanner, it'll tell you if you have any problems with your engine, without the ripping off. Keep up a schedule on how much you drive so you know when to change your fluids. Also, try and find an independent mechanic near you that you can trust."
46,"That's incredible.

Hope everybody is ok."
47,"Well, as boys talk, we talked.  I was always the guy that was getting more than anyone else.  Some would call bullshit because I never said who it was or her age.  I was def brainwashed from an early age.

I wish I knew where the shame came from.  Its weird, because still to this day I feel ashamed.  Maybe it was because I liked it, or because i never spoke up, or because i was being abused and didnt know I was actually being abused."
48,I love my dog 
49,When it's super busy I just chill behind the desk. Alotta times people will come in and chat me up when I don't really wanna talk 
50,I'm having trouble figuring out how to ask questions without phrasing things in the wrong way. Your description seems to set this up as choice-based but everything I understand about both trans people and queer people is that it is about identity and not a choice. Why did you 'decide' not to be transgender anymore? 
51,"Nice, well good luck with your diarrhea "
52,"I was your standard midwest, white Methodist male.

And after reading your question I think you might be onto the root of my shame..."
53,"It's just down the hall, but for some reason all the bathroom doors are propped open today and I'm afraid someone will walk by and hear my agony. "
54,How much do you get paid?
55,"When people joke that you were just a lucky dude, what is it that they don't really understand?

And what about it made you feel ashamed?

EDIT: follow up question"
56,Play [This](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HuCUVbM3vjc) real loud on your cellphone!
57,I was a frequent visitor of the game room as an underclass men. Got good at pool and won two tournaments. Boss learned who I was and offered.
58,"Ocassionally, people think i am his mother when we are out. We both think this is hot and like it. "
59,What do you hate now? For me it's when I'm making chili and then I notice that I'm low on corn chips so then I have to go out to the grocery store to get some. PISSES ME OFF!
60,I'm wondering this as well as all forms of loan are reasonable and fair.
61,"Pretty much, yeah. We've been working on adding vectors lately. I don't know much about what's going on, but my lab partner is pretty good with this stuff. "
62,"Well, at least he will have one in an hour"
63,"I used to work on the E-3 Awacs, a giant radar station in the sky.

The most difficult thing I had to do was make the call on an inflight emergency regarding our engines. We had picked up a few medical patients from Japan and were transporting them to Hawaii.  Shortly after we hit cruising speed and altitude, #3 engine starting compressor stalling (basically trying to shut down.) One of the patients was a new born baby in an incubator. If we turned around to land back in Japan, that meant those people would have to wait for another ride to Hawaii, but if we continued, we very well could have lost #3. The airplane could fly on 3 engines, but would require more power to sustain the speed and more fuel. We were at the point of no return where if we had a severe engine problem, we very well could run out of fuel trying to make it to Hawaii. 

I essentially helped the pilots find a sweet spot in #3's rpm's that it would not compressor stall. We dropped #2's rpm's to match and made it to Hawaii. It was very tense, but that was one of those rare moments where everything fell on my shoulders and I had very little time to act."
64,"Lmao I've been there, a lot of times you can't miss a single lab or you fail the class, you say college physics so that means algebra based physics right?"
65,"I found other ways to manage my dysphoria and decided to desist from transition. That's why I frame it as a choice.

My feelings were not a choice. The way I describe and deal with them are."
66,"Still holding on, my friend. "
67,Depends on if my takedown is successful or if I want to work in guard. 
68,"&gt; I hope they find you. Thanks for screwing everyone else over. 

You should be thanking congress and the banks for taking away consumer protections like bankruptcy. They won't find us. There are 10 million other people just like us as well..."
69,Not a bike. But I stole a pen from the library sign in sheet once. 
70,"When I was drunk so 12:00-3:00 at night. 
We just pulled on bikes and found some that weren't locked properly, or locked at all. 
We didn't sell the bikes, we actually put them in a different spot.
Did it because I was trying to prove my friends that I could do a wheelie... yeah I couldn't do the wheelie. 

I do have stories on stealing bikes from a lost and found cage just for bikes on my campus though... "
71,"Is your doctor hot?  You should tell them something like ""You make my heart flutter""."
72,That's a lot of dicks.
73,I've never seen anyone else leave during lab time and I'm nervous 
74,"So not only did she take out loans she won't pay back, pushing up interest rates for other students, but she is working illegally to avoid paying taxes? You expect people to be sympathetic to that? She is an embarrassment. No wonder people accuse millenials of being entitled.  "
75,"Nothing I can spontaneously think of, that I thought was really useless as in not being used by them. I travelled with employers to NYC for 2,5 months staying at a hotel and the hotel bill came up to $7m. Much of the money was spent on 'useless' things. I hardly thing renting out almost 3 entire floors of a hotel is necessary. "
76,Cutting is a serious problem. Did you talk to her about getting a therapist?
77,"well the pedo sympathizers have made it into the thread - name checks out.  Welcome!

I was 6 when it began, so no, I wasnt consenting.  It started when she was 15 and ended in her 20's, while she was in college.  

Now, to say that I didnt grow to enjoy would be a lie.  To say I wasnt brainwashed or manipulated to enjoy it would also be untrue.

When exactly do you consider a female to be a women, when they start menstruating?

"
78,The man has changed and opened up about it. No need to be a dick.
79,"Probably when it ended.  Now that Im looking back at it, I remember my older brother being the one to step in.  haha  - and now I can actually remember the conversation vaguely.  He never liked it, and this specific conversation revolved around me having to be the one to make an effort not to see this person any longer.  He helped me.  I need to thank him for that.

Edit - I was always aware that it was more than experimenting because she had boyfriends that I would meet.  She was well older than I.  We had nothing in common, other than a relationship with her brother.
"
80,"I feel you already know the answer to this one, pal."
81,"Lol was a girl in physics lab last year, so I'm calling absolute bs on there being a lot of attractive ladies in there"
82,"Live in Seattle. You go outside you get wet and it's dark 
"
83,Is there a good way to tell if an autoshop is trying to rip off it's customers? I always feel like they are ripping me off.
84,"I'm a senior, my teacher just closed the blinds and blocked off the doors at first and was just saying that she wanted to go home. Later other students were saying their friends were evacuated 

Okay right as I was typing this something happened I'm not sure what but everyone was screaming and running and I just ran I don't know what's going on"
