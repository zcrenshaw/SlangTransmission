0,Boy I'm so sorry
1,Large tits is required
2,I knowingly wrote a bad check for a brand new BMW 5 Series. Stupid car dealership took a personal check and I drove off plain and simple. Check later bounced with insufficient funds obviously.
3,"I left. Not due to any particular election result, but because I did not like the direction I sensed the country going in. I currently live in Amsterdam. I've been living here for 7 years. "
4,"No, my mom made it in her uterus"
5,"There has been 2 times. First: before I left the state. I had just made bail on my probation violation and I was at my apartment. I had missed my new probation hearing since because I figured the judge would terminate me and I would have to re open my court case. I decided to pack up and leave. I was all packed up waiting to leave the next morning when I hear a pounding on my door. BANG BANG ""SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT."" I nearly shit myself. Immediately I said to myself not tonight so I slowly grabbed my stuff and open my window and climbed onto the roof. After I ignored their knocks, the warrants they had allowed them to enter. They saw all my stuff was gone and figured I already left. Didn't even look out the damn window as I was clearly out there lol. Waited for them to leave and stayed up all night Incase they came back. Got on the bus right outside my place that morning and I was gone. Second: about 7 months ago, I was working a sales job that had me going to businesses. Some considered it solicitation so I had the cops called on me. Police show up and ask for ID. I said I don't have any and asked for all my personal info. I gave them my brothers info. He's about 2 years younger than me. Kind of looks like me. A bit skinnier. Cops bought it and I left."
6,The original reason I did it was because of a friend who told me how easy it was to write bad checks for awesome shit. I went big. Later in turned into something as a rush or high to deal with anxiety.
7,"It washes my asshole, American ones doesn't?"
8,You sounds like our President
9,"Translated to English ""my nigga"""
10,"I don't want to ask you anything.

Get that driver on here."
11,Somebody who is kind enough to give their time to a suicide hotline might pause before granting this request because the fact that you referred to people being afraid for their lives (based on actual things the candidate said) as an overreaction is precisely the kind of thing that hurts the people suicide hotlines generally aim to help. Makes this post seem more troll-y than like a genuinely interested request. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
12,"Great question. Number one: stress. I probably took years off my life with the stress I have. Lol. Two: A long conversation with my mom. I talked to her on the phone and I have seen them these two years and I really miss them. We talked and cried for hours. Finally: I want to return to normal life. I'm only 23 and I have so many things I want to accomplish. I want to get married, own a home, start a business. All things I can't really do the right way with warrants.
Edit: spelling I haven't seen them*"
13,Wow.. Pretty interesting AMA. Thanks for doing this! What type of jail time do you anticipate? Do you have a savings set-up for yourself for when you get out? 
14,Thank you. Glad to share. I am not too sure and my lawyer can't make any promises but worst case scenario is total probation revocation and maximum 5 years. I'm not sure of other charges pending either. Well my savings now will most likely go towards the courts and any restitution to lighten my punishment. The rest I am saving to start my business and house myself when I get out.
15,They probably asked to be put back in one. It sounds nice to me right about now. 
16,RIP OP's butthole
17,cool
18,Four loko mixed with ever clear 
19,"The best thing is comedy, which is little know abroad.
The worst thing is people's taste in music"
20,"No, I'm still student. Let's go together two years later"
21,"I was waiting for someone to ask that. So I met a guy through some connections and he owns a pawn shop. He was a big time crook and new the ins and outs of every scheme and scam known to man. When you write a check for a car they don't give you the title until the check clears. So I had the car but no title. Impossible to sell a car without a title. So he helped me part out the car piece by piece and sell it by the part. I ended up making about $30,000 cash out of it."
22,"Normally I expect to get praised on my size, and then to have them offer to come and fuck me. 
Sadly it hasn't worked yet, but don't worry I'm not one to give up. It'll work eventually. I know it."
23,What hapenned for you to get the charges?
24,"I'm not American, but I work heavily in politics behind the scenes in my country (I work in a niche area related to my health field - but he people I work with would be the equivalent of a cabinet/secretary). 

The thing that surprised me when I got into this was how little involved in the day to day decision making the name recognizable politicians are (and that goes all the way to the top). Yes the head ultimately makes the decision, but the bureaucrats below them 100% control the information they have to make those decisions.

This means you really shouldn't be scared of Trump or Pence. It doesn't mean you shouldn't be worried, as I don't know who the behind the scenes people will be for those two … but it's those individuals people should be paying attention to. "
25,"If I'm so, you didn't make an appointment "
26,Something you fuck when you're blacked out
27,"1. Decide what immigration program is the best fit. I decided on [Express Entry, the skilled worker program.](http://15miles.info/cic-express-entry/)

2. I had to take a test to prove I spoke English, get my degree assessed, and provide my whole job and travel history for the past 10 years.

3. [I gathered a bunch more paperwork](http://15miles.info/document-checklist-express-entry/). I registered for the Job Bank and went on a few job interviews (not through the job bank). In the end, I kept my existing US job and now work remotely, but that means I didn't get those 600 points.

4. I got an ITA. I scanned and uploaded all of my paperwork and got a medical exam.

5. I spent 6 months feeling anxious.

6. I submitted very specific passport photos and updated passport scans. I started to realize I had no idea how [landing](http://15miles.info/landing-in-canada/) or [moving](http://15miles.info/move-stuff-canada/) worked.

7. [I picked a neighborhood in Toronto](http://15miles.info/toronto-neighborhood-guide/) and [got a condo.](http://15miles.info/buying-condo-canada/) [I got the apartment set up.](http://15miles.info/setting-up-your-apartment/) I [set up a Canadian bank account](http://15miles.info/banking-canada-americans/).

8. I got approval. I [flew up to declare landing](http://15miles.info/landing-in-canada/), [signed up for OHIP, and requested a PR card](http://15miles.info/getting-settled-canada).

9. [I moved all of my stuff from Brooklyn to Toronto](http://15miles.info/move-stuff-canada/), including my [cats.](http://15miles.info/flying-with-cats/)

Getting all the paperwork together was a real nuisance, but it's all doable. The only real stumbling blocks would be things that would make you ineligible for Express Entry. 

If you have a criminal record the process will take much longer, since you'll require special attention. My application was fairly standard, so it took the promised 6 months to process."
28,Ya man fuck it but skip the date go right in for the kill
29,Have you ever considered the fact you're a piece of shit?
30,and btw why did you decide to do that?
31,How can you be certain it was the same pencil and not an identical pencil?
32,"I think the initial explosion reverberated through the entire house because my roommate just asked if I heard a pipe burst

Edit: he's yelling at me now because he's going on a date and hasn't showered yet

Edit edit: it BURNSS

Update: it feels like Satan is doing an Irish jig in my colon

Why won't it stop!?

Update: the water level in the toilet has become dangerously high. I can't flush because it'll splash gummy bear shit toiled water all over my bum and I can't stand because Niagara Falls decided to vacation in my ass

Edit: send help

Update: I think it's mostly gone. It's only trickling now. Fucking Christ everything hurts

Update: my quilted northern plush felt like 50 grit sandpaper"
33,おっぱい
34,He means murder her. 
35,"Yeah, the fact Trump is appointing horrible henchmen is what scares me. "
36,"Where in America could a MANAGER live off $9.50 an hour, after working in the company for 2.5 years?  Where I live starting minimum wage is $10/hour, and no one can live off that.

Edit:  good grief, it's most of America:

"
37,Nothing life is pointless then you die
38,The southern border
39,"My age does make it difficult, especially when I have to deal with employees who are older than me and don't have much respect (understandably). The other managers at my store are all at least 10 years older than me. I make $9.50 an hour right now. The owner doesn't pay me as much as the other managers because I'm so much younger, which I don't think is fair on his part, but ultimately it's his money and I'm free to look for another job if I want to. As for feeling experienced, I'd say that I'm definitely inexperienced, but I do a decent job in general."
40,"About 2.5 inches now, use it whenever i write on paper (pretty often)"
41,Great question. I have severe anxiety and the only times I have been truly anxious free is when I stole that car and when I gamble. I have stolen to gamble as well just so I can have an anxiety free night. So I have always thought about an underlying issue.
42,Can you use bacon and whipped cream inside a turnip mother love bone?
43,I can't make close friends with them
44,"I'm so sleepy so I can't answer anymore.
Thank you for asking me"
45,"People have this idea that you just pack up your stuff and go there.  For the average person, it takes *years* to get Canadian citizenship."
46,"No, it's like ramen soup"
47,"I love indie rock bands like modest mouse, arcade fire"
48,"I think low birth rate is so serious problem. Though the number of people over 65 is increasing, the government doesn't institute crucial policy. It is said to be because the politician who claim the policy which sounds good to elderly people is more likely elected"
49,"Wow, that is not nearly as bad as I was expecting. Whenever I came to my dad with bad news when I was younger, before I explained he would always ask me ""did you kill anyone?"" and I'd say ""no"" and he'd say alright then this is manageable.

Good luck!"
50,"Because of my technique, she got high"
51,Math is pointless unless you're asking for spare change to get that next loko
52,"I don't mean your tendency is bad, but you had better be a little more humble."
53,"that you know of, how close have you come to being caught? "
54,Could you rephrase the question please?
55,"I can use both, though blender tonic repeal mighty morphin dolphin can have serious detrimental effects if used to extremes. Watch yourself out there, it's a cruel world."
56,"I left right after the second Obama election. It wasn't the only reason but factored into it. Most of the people I know voted for him simply because he was black and knew nothing of what he stood for. I'm not a far-right leaner or anything at all. For the most part was also fed up with materialism and the way the U.S. society as a whole was seeming to degrade. Personally, in my own life I had just gone through a horrible breakup with a woman who was cheating on me for over a year while being physically abusive (i'm a big guy but still). I didn't have any family connections or anything just bought a one way ticket and went. It was the greatest decision I have ever made. I learned a lot about myself, patience, respect and understanding of other cultures, 2 new languages I can confidently speak, and made lifelong friends with people from all over the world. "
57,"Big nose, blue eye, tall height, and I think they tend to express their feeling too directly"
58,"I'm not.
And I hope you don't mistakenly believe Japanese students' hair has bright color like pink or green"
59,"There's about nine.  Chewing,  lip smacking, sneezing,  nose blowing, sniffing, drinking, dry lips when speaking,  squeaking of shoes!  She is about 9/10 on the severity scale.   Edit : two more.......  Cat washing itself and whistling through teeth! "
60,You shouldn't sharpen pencils with your butt. 
61,"No. I'm ideologically a socialist. I voted for and am satisfied with President Obama. I left because of the rise in neoconservativism and xenophobia in the mainstrean American population. 

However, mostly I just left to do something different. I wanted to know what Europeans thought of us. Amsterdam is a perfect place to do this as it is very diverse and Dutch culture has been highly influenced by American culture.

I first visited Amsterdam in 2000. I liked it very much and felt that it was a place where I could live. Eight years later, I ended up moving here. "
62,Not the only reason but yeah I left. 
63,I think they did wrong thing. You're correct. But China likes demanding apologies I think
64,Gas station burritos and malt liquor
65,"First , we're glad that we still have you around .

I wanted to ask you ; how did it feel ?"
66,"No, because I'm not good at speaking foreign languages"
