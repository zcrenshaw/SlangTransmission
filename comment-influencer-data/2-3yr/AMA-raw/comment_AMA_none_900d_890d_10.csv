0,IM DRIVEN BY FINDING THAT MCNUGGET SAUCE
1,"Use it to pay for college, and keep the rest in some form of savings account or investment plan.

Sincerely,

Someone in their 30s that wished they had 3 million dollars 15 years ago."
2,"I'm pumped for your ""I'm 18 and just left the Jehovahs Witnesses after years of being brainwashed"" AMA."
3,Liked it a lot. It's limited time only nature caused it to live a life that burned twice as bright for half as long.
4,"It was really, REALLY good. I've made a homemade version of it a few times."
5,It was ok. Better on fries than nuggets as I recall. Basic sub- par teriyaki goo.
6,"I agree with this, but if I were to splurge just a bit, I'd recommend getting your dad set up. Sounds like he did a damn good job and deserves a reward."
7,How does it feel to know that literally nobody wants you to knock on their door?
8,You didn't lose a few friends. You shook a few vultures. 
9,"my late aunt, a little over 3 million, ive put it away until i know what to study and until i feel im ready to handle it :)"
10,"Basically they mixed some Sweet and Sour with some BBQ sauce and it was good, as others have said it was best with Fries"
11,i got him a new truck and i gave him rent and bill money for the next 10 years :) he refuses to take any more help but ill always be here for him
12,"Current JW here. It IS a cult. That is not just my opinion, it is a fact. And I present this evidence: **Every one** of these [Warning Signs that You are in a Cult](http://www.esama.ca/warning-signs-that-you-are-in-a-cult) applies to Jehovah's Witnesses. 


In addition, if you decide that you no longer believe **every word** of the doctrine presented in their main magazine, The Watchtower, your choices are to fake it and pretend you believe or leave and lose your family: your parents, your spouse, your siblings, your friends. Everyone who is a Jehovah's Witness will stop speaking to you if you openly believe things that conflict with their doctrine. 



My wife threatened to leave me when I expressed doubts and that's the only reason I'm still a JW, because I don't want to lose my family. Many current JW's are in the same situation. But the vast majority are too indoctrinated to see things for what they are."
13,"This is exactly why i love reddit.  Nothing like getting valuable, caring life advice from a guy named buttholepussy."
14,"This is ""Ask Me Anything"". Not ""Ask Me Something's"" :)

It's a very relevant question. Thank you.

The project budget of $20/day covers transport, meals, accommodation and visas. It is meant as an average over the entire journey. In some countries I'm above while in other countries I'm below. My current overall average is slightly above but so far I have covered most of the expensive countries. I see it coming down and believe that the budget will stick (more or less). It was sponsored by Ross Offshore until April 2016. Since then it has been self funded. http://www.rossoffshore.no

As such the spendings have exceeded USD 25,000 by now."
15,Equatorial Guinea by far!! Apparently you don't even need a visa if you're US American. But for any other westerners the visas are tough. To top it off the land borders were all closed at the time when I was in Central Africa. No one in and no one out. I managed to get a visa and cross the border after 4 months of trying.
16,pretty good.
17,How is Jehovah's Witness not a cult?
18,Show your dad some kindness 
19,"It's become my reason to go on living. Well, that and season three seeming to actually exist. "
20,Let's bump this up people. We need to find this individual that has this as a career. 
21,"Why not both?

No I've fucked a fair share of men in my dreams, though flying is a standard way of transportation for me, so I do that as often as one would walk. I'd say its 70/30."
22,"In order to learn to lucid dream (anyone can learn it btw) you need to change some things around your usual sleeping schedule as wel as pick up some habits during the day.

1. Reality checks. You need to train your unconciousness to be able do understand the difference between reality and the dream world. To check wether you're sleeping or awake, you need to check this and make this a habit in your daily life. For example: ask yourself multiple times during the day 'am I dreaming?' and do a check. Examples of reality checks are: trying to push your fingers through your other hand (they will pass through in a dream) or look at a clock nearby (clocks are always fucked up in dreams). When you make this a habit, you'll do it in your dreams too and BAM you're lucid.

2. Keep a dream diary. No point in lucid dreaming if u can't remember the dream ;)

3. Do exersizes before bed and at night. They are called WILD, MILD and WBTB. If you want to know more about those, I'd suggest you visit ld4all.com, where I learned these techniques. (Find the guide)

It's all about awareness tbh! Usually when you dream, you don't question the world around you. A pink elephant with lady Gaga on top while floating in the air is perfectly normal in a dreamer's mind. You need to teach your subconcious to question these events. Is this normal. Am I dreaming?

... are you dreaming right now?"
23,That's some galactic federation thinking there.
24,"https://youtu.be/QnkrL42R7gk

I instantly thought of this when John Mulaney, says him and a friend played what's new pussycat 21 times in a diner. It's a hilarious story. "
25,"If we demand it we could get it back for a limited time. If the entire rick and morty fandom came together and tweeted at mcdonalds, demanding Szechwan sauce be offered again they would totally do it.  "
26,What percent of the time are you having sex vs flying in your dreams 
27,"Who left you the money?
How much was left for you?
And how do you plan to use your money?"
28,If you stick 3mil into an interest bearing account you could literally only live on the interest and not eat into the principal. $60-90k per year.
29,"Former JW here, it absolutely is one. They're a very organized doomsday cult."
30,"Why did the JWs announce in 1920 that ""Millions now living will never die!"" and repeatedly state that Armageddon would come before the generation of 1914 passed away?

Where does it say in the Bible to count your hours of field service? 

How did Noah visit every island in the world to drop off animals that only exist in that one place? 

Why does the society tell you which hotels you are allowed to stay in if you go to the convention? 

Why does your translation say Goliath was a giant when the dead sea scrolls say he was 6'9""? 

If the Bible is God's word why are there so many differences in translations and why doesn't the original still exist?

Why does not eating blood also mean you can't have a blood transfusion, which is obviously not the same as eating?

Why are the Jehovah's Witnesses basically the last Christian denomination to deny the science of evolution? 

Even though things like abortion and smoking and pornography didn't exist in Bible times, surely God knew about them ahead of time? So if God wanted all of these things to be avoided why didn't he put them into the Bible instead of telling them to the Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society? 

And how were people supposed to know about these things before the Jehovah's Witnesses were founded in the early 1900s? 
"
31,"my mother left when i was young and dropped contact with us due to marriage issues and she was young when i was born, she thought i was a mistake and so she never supported us or contacted us at all

i feel like it taught me to value every dollar and it hopefully prepared me for what life will be like when making big responsible payments, i know that money doesn't last long if you don't value every little bit

i did lose a few friends because they were angry i chose to put my money away until i felt ready, my best friend of 13 years has supported me through it all and im blessed for that

i am also treated differently when people find out, i would say they act sheepish or sometimes hostile unfortunately"
32,"I would use a little money to do some traveling.  Leaving the country is huge, and if you were as poor as my family, that was out of the question!  You may discover what it is you want to study during your travels!  Do it cheap, backpack around... You and your Reddit friend! "
33,"I was drinking and putting my faith in autocorrect. Don't worry, it's going to be ok."
34,"I can totally recreate the taste with soy sauce, Sriracha, sweet baby Ray's and some turbulent juice. It works great for a marinade as well. And lubricant."
35,Honestly the only relevant thread
36,"I think it's because our country is getting less and less religious as the years go by, and the sentiment has become ""really? I thought we were done with that"". I mean, would you like it if there was a group of people that believed basically the complete opposite of what you believe, out there knocking on your door trying to convince you to come to their side of things? Maybe in theory, but probably not in actuality. 

I will say that I've noticed religious door-knockers are getting much better about taking a polite ""no"" for an answer, and leaving it at that; it's greatly appreciated. I used to almost get into arguments for not wanting to talk to them. Maybe they're slowly realizing that people really just don't want to be proselytized to. 

Either way, good luck. "
37,"Heterosexual female here. You should try fucking men sometimes, I have a feeling you'll enjoy yourself ;)"
38,Are you the sharpest tool in the shed?
39,What is your beef with vampires?
40,"McDonald's Commercial from 1998 featuring the sauce. 

https://youtu.be/mGRDCRuPklc "
41,"Be careful. I was in that situation for a couple years. It was some of my best and worst times. It ultimately ended my marriage.
"
42,"This isn't really a question, but PLEASE for the love of god be smart with your money. Be as frugal as possible because 3 million won't last you long in a frivolous lifestyle. Also stay away from drugs because that's just stupid."
43,"I can't imagine the costs, Do have sponsors or just living meagerly? (Not trying to be nosy about your personal finances just seems ungodly expensive)."
44,"Would you like a free copy of Popular Science? 

Just joking, but please stop coming to my door on Saturday morning. "
45,i aint
46,yea.
47,"Oh now we're getting interesting. Here are a few:

- Recreated a scene based on a houdehold I made in the sims 3, in wich I had slaves locked in the basement who had to paint in order to make money for me. They made some damn fine art though. Oh and they were naked.

- Had sex with Johnny Depp. Summoned Orlando Bloom. Fucked him in front of Depp while he was crying. Then murdered both of them with throwing knives while singing a pirate song (big pirates of the carribean fan back then)

- Cage fights with dinosaurs. Somehow they all managed to die and the floor was covered in dino shit afterwards (regretted this instantly)

- and of course the classic: world domination. Murdered pretty much anyone who opposed me, only to laugh at the chaos I created. Then, when I had to pee on my epic golden toilet made out of the bones of my enemies, I pissed myself in real life. Guess that's karma.

You can do all kinds of crazy shit in your dreams, no consequenses! Needless to say, I would never do these things in real life (or would I....). "
48,This. I went to a McDonald's in DC that had the sauces in the self serve ketchup containers. I drenched my fries in em 
49,"When I was in high school, there were 2 teachers who worked in the social science department. They were married, but prior to their relationship, she was his student. IIRC, there was a 10 to 15 year gap between them aswell. 
It's not as uncommon as you think. "

52,It IS a cult.
53,Sometimes I feel like I'm wasting time. The thing is that this attitude of hating on people that knock on your door really only exists in the US and some other first world countrys. When I go to other countries people are more than welcoming to us which I tend to find very strange. So it's really more of a culture thing. Also I don't really enjoy talking to strangers so having no one answer is a usually a relief for me
54,We don't care if it takes 9 seasons! 
55,How'd you like the play?
56,"I am not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty. That was fake! I’m driven by finding that McNugget sauce! I want that Mulan McNugget sauce, Morty. That’s my series arc, Morty. If it takes NINE seasons, I want my McNuggets dipping sauce, Szechuan sauce, Morty. That's what’s… It’s gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty … Season nine, nine more seasons Morty. Nine more seasons Morty until I get that dipping Szechuan sauce, Morty. For 97 more years, Morty. I want that McNugget sauce, MORTY!!!"
57,When is your birthday?
58,Which country has proven the most difficult to get into?

61,"In an earlier post, you mentioned that you love God more than your sister and this is why you turned your back on her. I commend your bravery. 
But if this isn’t the most idiotic, stupid, and disgustingly shitty exercise of faith I've seen then I don’t know what is. 
Do you lot knock on each other’s head’s for practice or what? You’ve turned your back on your own flesh and blood for a God whose existence you can’t even substantiate.                   
Shame on you, fuck your God, and fuck the religion that has ripped the love that ought to come naturally for a man towards his sister from your heart and poisoned it with this garbage ideology.
I’ll tell you this much- if there is any god you will answer for this betrayal and if there has been any test, you have failed it. And if it is your God, I look forward to burning in hell as far away as possible from his sick deranged depravity. 
Have you no shame?
"
62,"See the other threads for a few examples but a more recent interaction would be a few weeks ago. A guy came in to trade in a retro system to get one of the new Xbox One S bundles. He seemed really nervous while he was doing the transaction so I kinda thought maybe the console he was trading in was stolen. Since we're really big on trades corporate insisted that we do not worry about taking in stolen goods and just to accept trades anyway. So I had turned around to plug in the console to our testing system to make sure it worked and when I turned around to see some of his other items he had pulled his dick out through the zipper section of his pants and was just starring at me. He yelled out ""Praise Kek!"" and ran out of the store leaving the console and few games he brought in. It was so weird. A female co-worker called the police."
63,"I don't always spend my nights fucking dreamy men in my dreams but trust me: dream-sex is almost just as good as real sex.  Sometimes I summon 15 men to worship me and have sex with me, and sometimes I make sweet love to a celebrity or other dude. Sometimes I just want to feel loved :D"
64,"Wrong.  Getting educated protects you from opportunists.  It helps you make better decisions.  An education is never wasted.  Glad I got one, although Uncle Sam paid for lots of it."
65,thank you for looking out for me :) ive invested it for when im ready to handle it all
66,"I was really exited about the idea that I could actually do this. Of course I don't know I could pull it off at the time...I just though so. And I was frankly far more naive about how demanding it would be.

Then I began to back out as I felt I was to old and should start a family instead. I was 34, had a career and all my friends were on that path. 

Somehow I felt like I should had done it when I was 24. But then I though I would say that I should have done it when I was 34 if I was in fact 44. So my age became less of an excuse. 

I was really exited about the adventure and doing something which had never been done before. And a friend began to help me get started with the planing. 

One day I got a phone call regarding a payed project within my profession (logistics). When I turned that down I realized that I had become to involved with this adventure and that this was really what I wanted to do."
67,"In the 4 times that it happened outside of open heart surgery... at least for me... it was like when your nodding off and trying to keep your self awake. But then you can't. Like I lost track of time.  It was uncomfortable, but not painful. "
68,"Easter is just around the corner ...  But I won't assume you celebrate it.

70,"My husband met a girl and they became fast friends. We all started hanging out and I could clearly see thy were falling in love - fast forward through all the jealousy and heartache I could convince myself of, I finally realized my husband didn't want to choose one over the other. And as it turned out the girl was starting to develop feelings for me as well! After much careful thinking and self evaluation I decided it would be in MY best interest to move the relationship forward for all of us. Turns out we mesh perfectly! I opened my heart and it turned out to be the best thing for me - I don't think I could ever realistically go back."
71,"Hi there,
Nope, I'm saving that towards the end of the project when I have hopefully built up more incentive for people to help me get onboard ;)"
72,i am afraid they do not stop coming.

74,"/r/leicester checking in - thanks for the heads up /u/Sub_Mentions bot!

[Uppingham School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppingham_School) is a posh private place which used to be in the far east of the county but is now actually in the county of Rutland. I don't think there's a Rutland sub :-(

Anyway, /r/leicester wuold be as good a place as any to ask, but I wouldn't get your hopes up, that's a pretty specific request and I doubt you'll get any first hand answers, but good luck anyway."
75,"Best customers are those that have done a little bit of research but still have an open mind. It's easy if you come in with some idea of what you need and what you're using it for. 

The worst customers are know-it-alls that are brand loyal. I may be helping someone with a Chevy and an unsolicited Ford guy comes and goes on a rant about how a Chevy is a POS when realistically, they're both great trucks!"
76,Today

80,"... I might have became a little too excited when I saw my golden toilet made out of the bones of my enemies...

Also, don't pee in your dream. Never, ever do it, its a TRAP!"
81,"I used to! That was due to my obsessive training to become lucid, wich involved waking up very early in the morning to do 'exercises'. 

But just lucid dreaming with no preparations or exercises: no. A lucid dream works the same as a normal dream, only this time you're in control instead of following the dream-story. Allthough sometimes when I have had a really cool or intense lucid dream, I will feel very enthusiastic and energetic in the early morning wich can result in me getting tired in the afternoon :P

TOTALLY WORTH IT THOUGH "
82,"Do you wear boxers, briefs, or pantaloons ?"
83,"At 15, you are at an age when you really start questioning the world and the things you have been taught growing up.  I was just older than you when I first realized I was an atheist.  Research your doubts, but don't forget who you are.  Good luck to you."
84,Let's make the AMA happen! Someone on Reddit should be able to track one of them down. 
85,"If i had children, it would be easier to pick the favorite. I can't even come close to picking a favorite. I shooting just about everything except black powder. 

I live in a wealthy area so I get to meet celebs from time to time, so that's cool. The politics after Sandy Hook made .22 LR ammo really hard to get for a long time. Guy bought a .22 rifle for his son to teach him to shoot, but couldn't get ammo. I gave him my number and sold him some of mine at cost so that his kid could get out and learn. Keep in mind that the demand made the value go up like 500%, so I could have made some good money off of him. Both still thank me every time they see me and his boy always tells me about his last adventure out shooting and how much better he's gotten. I love when people follow up and show me pictures of successful hunts or crazy tight groups at the range.  "
86,"Yes! Simple example: when my cat meows downstairs wanting me to wake up and feed him, I hear this while still half-asleep/dreaming, so I would 'summon' my cat in my dream and feed him to make the meowing stop. Feeding my dream cat apparently doesn't stop my real cat from meowing, so I woke up and fed the bastard.

Exiting the dream isn't something I want, usually! I try to stay in my dream for as long as possible, by for example grabbing a dream object or spinning around real fast. But if I do want to wake up (in a cool way) I just jump off a building. Also I can just close my eyes and feel my real  body lying in bed, and I wake up that way too."
87,"I'm very sorry for your loss. Some people think I'm negative, but if I can get 5 more with my wife I'll be a happy fellow. 17 would be great."
88,Unpopular opinion but Milk Duds
89,Aaaah jehovah witnesses and their sexual abuse cases and free speech and tought problems
90,"Yes, I still teach at the same institution. My colleagues were surprised at first, but they got used it too after a few days, my friends and family were surprised as well, but they were fine with it once they met him. "
91,"We were also. Then extreme jealousy started about a year and a half into it. She would get so upset if husband and I were in the same room together. She would get upset if husband and I sat next to each other.  She would get upset if we briefly talked about something from our past like ""Oh I ran into our old neighbor Stacy at the store today"". Eventually husband would avoid anything to do with causing a conflict which would result in him ignoring me when she was home, and he wouldn't tell her she was being a little ridiculous. So I was the one calling her out gently. Reminding her that we both still love her and we aren't pushing her away - there is plenty of room on the couch for all of us, we even saved a spot, I'm walking through the kitchen and he was there so we start talking. Its not like we were actively going out of our way. We celebrated three anniversaries. Mine and husbands. Husbands and hers. Then one for the three of us. Husbands and hers they would do a nice dinner and celebrated. Husband and mine, she called, texted and cried the whole time because we were not with her. Husband catered to her and our anniversary was a disaster. The year before everything was fine. Not sure what got triggered in her head. 

Basically, don't hide any feelings back.  I never did, but she did and it blew up. Also make time to do something fun one on one. You want to develop your relationship with her, you want them to be able to go out once in a while, and its still important for you and husband to maintain a relationship. 

I miss both of them like crazy. "
92,"How can I do it, I have visions of doubling my awake time by being cognizant in my sleep "
93,My husband had this surgery in 1998. It wasn't easy but he lived for 17 years and died of an unrelated heart problem. He beat the odds and you will too. It's a very nasty cancer and I wish you luck. ( His was squamous cell stage 4 ) 
94,"I don't have a favorite country. But the 3 most unique countries I know are: Greenland, Cuba and Iran. You can't really compare them with other countries.

If I couldn't return to Denmark for some odd reason then I would go and live in Iceland. It's a great country but moreover there is amazing culture up there where everything is possible!

I have crossed the Atlantic Ocean twice already. Throughout the Saga I have been in several fishing boats, trawlers, cargo ships, containership's and much more.

I really love Ethiopian food (lately). But Italian food is my overall favorite."
