1,"Are you still at camp, because you haven't answered a damn thing. "
2,"The yellows. Utterly insane. They're so bright, I was so taken back by the yellow and blue on a police car (I live in the U.K.). "
3,"It goes back up into a  full erection in 10 seconds or less. It is, without a doubt the most terrifying thing I've ever seen"
4,"Ramen noodles and frozen pizza aren't necessarily cheaper than rice, beans, pasta, frozen vegetables, etc. Frugal cooking could help you save on your budget and make you healthier."
5,Beater
6,"""as it stands"""
7,"IMO 50% is good enough odds, for the experience you get if they work. Also if you get them from Enchroma, which is what I did, they offer a 60 day money back guarantee, so you can send them back if they don't work. (I don't work for Enchroma lool) "
8,"I went to do some food shopping yesterday. Upon payment, the woman working the till said to me the words ""I didn't know food shopping could be that exciting""... It's been a trying week thus far."
9,Send us your public key so we can verify your ligiticimy
10,6 hour shifts each. 
11,"Well shit...
Doctor said blood thinners and wearing my compressor should sort it out in no time but I'm definitely worried as it stands!"
12,It's not painful as much as it is a futile effort. It feels unfinished no matter how many times the supposed climax happens. 
13,"Hi Pedro, 

I'm particularly curious as to whether masturbating with this condition is in anyway painful, and if not, why are you not constantly teeing off?"
14,"Other than my penis, the stock of Smackdown Live in India I believe is also on the rise. "
15,"Omg not yet but you have just made me so excited, I didn't even think about that! I've only ever seen 2 colours in a rainbow, Yellow and Blue. "
16,"This lady found me as a newborn abandoned and in horrible health. She looked after me a few days and fell in love with me so she decided to keep me. In order to keep me, she decided to get fake documents so no one would take me away. I should also mention I am Chinese and was born a girl. 

The tipping point was perhaps when they had to tell me. Like it sounded so crazy. My mum married my European dad when I was 7 and they decided they couldn't risk getting the deal document for another 2 years and I believe it took nearly 2 years to be fully adopted since it was a special case "
17,"Not that we ever opened up suitcases but sometimes people would overload them and they would split open. Weirdest thing was probably an 8"" rubber floppy purple dildo fell out of a split open suitcase one day when I was delivering luggage to the arriving passengers carousel. The first thing I put on the carousel was the dildo. Then I waited about 10 seconds before putting all the luggage on. All the passengers got to watch it go around 3 times before one of the airline gate agents kicked it off. I laughed the whole time I was offloading the rest of the bags and looked at the passengers who were mostly laughing and taking pictures. You just know there was one person standing there knowing it was their dildo but would never say anything. No one ever claimed said dildo"
18,"I have a notebook containing passwords from games I used to play in 2006. I write down all my details in there for everything.

I also have used the same computer for the past 8-9 years."
19,How did you remember your password after all that time? 
20,Do you notice a deferens? 
21,What's your favorite color so far?
22,"A friend of mine has been severely colorblind as long as I've known him, to the point that I'd see him get visibly bummed out that he couldn't see certain things in nature as they are. He got a pair, put em on, and broke down into tears when he saw red (I believe) flowers for the first time. 

Colors are something so simple I've always taken for granted. It's amazing that this technology now exists for a lot of the colorblind. Enjoy the true beauty out there! 

Are there any colors you've seen that just completely went against everything you believed that color might actually look like? "
23,"In theory that is a rather feasible, and if I'm honest morbidly curious possibility"
24,"Atm I'm just wearing them properly outside, a sunset is really amazing atm, but I guess they're guna be helpful for reading pie charts and graphs that are differentiated by colour 

It's also quite odd when someone sees me wearing these glasses in the pouring rain lol, because they look like sunglasses "
25,if you do an AMA you need to actually answer the questions
26,"I get where he is coming from, I've never seen all the different types green leaves during autumn, everyone says it's beautiful and it just looks the same to me, kinda sucked, so I'm looking forward to this autumn   

The brightness of every single colour sort of floored me, especially the reds and the yellows. I didn't know what I was missing! True definition of you have to see it to believe it "
27,"The phone hasn't rung and I don't think it will. My understanding is that Chris is sticking with a team he's got used to working with on Broadchurch. Which makes absolute sense and frankly why wouldn't you? I am looking forward to seeing how he writes for the Doctor we leave him with, which I understand from Steven will still be blind, cursed to continually hop on one leg and unable to speak in anything but rhyming couplet."
28,Soylent is **people**!!! 
29,On the bright side you will be really good at raising a single eyebrow
30,You should make a tinder and use this to your advantage.
31,"Pills are more expensive and also, once a doctor stops writing scripts they are not easy to get. Heroin is cheap "
32,"A meditation course where you must not communicate with others (verbal, eye contact, gestures) to maintain the ""right speech"" - no speech is the only honest speech "
33,"I made 25k a year and qualified for most of them, you should sit down with an actual person who's paid to help you apply and make sure you're doing it correctly."
34,"I've handled the question about Chibnall elsewhere in this AMA, but regarding becoming Showrunner someday?... One of the things about writing for Who is that it does rewire your head quite a bit. Now every idea I have I find myself moulding it into a Doctor Who shape. As a result, I have folders full of monsters and rough arcs for a couple of seasons. So in theory, yeah, sure. Why not? How hard can it be?..."
35,It used to be Blink. I think that Heaven Sent has kind of edged it out...
36,Wait until you see blurple.
37,"This sucks. I'm sorry. I lived with my dad who had an opiate addiction. It ended up killing him. My whole family pretends he died of a heart attack and that he never had a problem. I'm the only one who faced the music on that one. It's a bitch. I'm sorry you have to see someone you love like that. It can be really hard. I just remember constantly feeling that my dad loved getting high more than he loved seeing me at important events or even just being alive to be my dad. I graduated today and I wish more then anything he was there to be proud of me. I always wonder if I was more upfront with him or if everyone didn't just turn a blind eye if he would still be alive today. This isn't your responsibility at all and in her own way your mom loves you. She is just sick. But talking about it and not pretending everything is normal might save her life and then she can be there, proud and clapping, for you when you walk across the stage to get your diploma. "
38,Is your dog driving or are you ?
39,Christmas will blow your mind.
40,Pills from dental work led to an opiate addiction
41,"Kinda. Just finished eating a sandwhich with hot chocolate. 60% of the people are in extreme poverty, 20% can not eat 3 full meals a day, 10% have jobs that generate some money to eat (thats where I fall in) and the other 10% steals money to eat (thats the government)"
42,"Thank you. 

100%. When I put them on it took about 10-20 secs for my eyes to adjust, and then I released what I was seeing, and as I was looking around all these colours just hit me at once, and it was very overwhelming causing me to cry in public. 

The adrenaline I was feeling was also incredible, I was shaking for about 2 hours, which led to me just crashing out completely haha.
 
I can feel the adrenaline even writing about it now. "
43,"Dude, try [true cyan](http://themetapicture.com/youve-never-seen-true-cyan-before-and-its-beautiful/). It's beautiful and my favorite color."
44,"You know, use those bit coins to build new computer.

Edit: I'm an idiot. "
45,"I have worked, for the past three days in morning shifts starting at 5am. 
I work at a Starbucks. "

47,"1. Crooked Hillary

2. Take a selfie.

3. I counteroffer, he gives me 2 million and gets her for a week."
48,"I'm hoping that one day I get to use that idea so I wouldn't dream of blowing it here.


But the main reason Steven had for ultimately rejecting it was that the outline was too dark. Which now you've seen Oxygen, should give you some idea of how dark we're talking.


It gets better – usually we go through a few rounds of tightening up an outline before they finally pull the trigger and set you off to write the script. We'd done a few rounds of this on IDEA X and it felt like a shoe-in. I felt certain that I was days away from being told to start work on the script. So I jumped the gun, figuring I'd get a head start. I was HALF WAY in to my first draft – literally half a finished script – when Steven emailed me and asked if I had a space idea... and I realised IDEA X was dead.


Steven is convinced that IDEA X would make a killer horror movie. We'll see..."
49,It sucks ass. No one should use it
50,"At the time it wasn't creepy but in light of recent events it is. Meeting Bill Cosby. It was weird though. I was going through a security checkpoint and had to stop in at this small building so the guard could verify I was authorized to be out there basically by scanning my card and doing a fingerprint scan. There was an old guy sitting in a chair off to my right that I wasn't paying much attention to while I was talking to the guard. When I did look over I did a double take and realized it was bill Cosby sitting there. He laughed when I did the double take and just loudly said ""Hey how ya doing there Hutch"". He shook my hand and patted me on the shoulder. Now...my name isn't hutch but throughout my 30 second talk with him, he must have called me hutch 5 or 6 times. He was in town for some event and was waiting at security for the customs agents to finish doing a random check on the small private jet he flew in on. This was probably around 2010 and I was just realizing at that moment how old bill Cosby looked. His eyes were cloudy and almost a grey color. He was acting weird...basically like a senile old man babbling about nothing and not making much sense. I left the building just thinking ""what the fuck is wrong with bill Cosby"" "
51," My good friend is a doctor and when I went to get a vasectomy he said to watch for the little puff of smoke that rises when they cauterize the tubes.   He said to try and breath it in, that's your balls soul!"
52,where did you get $144?
53,Sword and board or dual wield axes?
54,It's extrovert anonymous.
55,This might be better suited over at /r/AskReddit 
56,That's cool. I have bad colorblindness also and never knew they had special glasses. After taking the test on the website it says I would only have a 50% chance of seeing colors better and since they are really expensive I'll pass. But good for you and I hope they help.

58,Or [blello](https://youtu.be/ui9QygWUloo)
59,I sexually identify as an attack helicopter
60,You really don't understand addiction then...do you really think all addicts don't want to change?
61,I read an article that says there are 2 types of perpetual erections and the non painful one is so uncommon that it is usually not diagnosed correctly but can lead to irreversable damage to the penis.  You might need to look into that. 
62,No more hard times for anyone else &lt;3 
63,Have you snapped a jewelry box on her hand yet?
64,Possibly pal
65,At least you wont roll out of bed.
66,"China had a one-child policy for a long time, and if your first child was a girl people would often give them away or kill them in hopes of having a son and carrying on the family name."
67,[deleted]
68,"Have you tried googling ""Rosie Odonnel nudes""? *NOTE: I am not a licensed doctor, just trying to help you out with a homeopathic method."
69,"I've seen various articles about it over the years. Most of the actors say that it's pretty awkward because you've got the cameras and lights and other crew. Basically it's not sexy at all. As for getting an erection sometimes they do, it goes with the territory. They're all adults, no one really cares."
70,What happens after you ejaculate?
71,I've tried just tucking it sideways as it tends have more area to cover and be less noticeable. But regardless of coverage method it tends to just eventually... fwoomp away. 
72,Dual wield axes
73,you make a valid point. Thanks 
74,"So, in effect, there's a genuine risk you could 'over-milk' yourself?"
75,My only problem is my towel is always smoking crack and telling me to not forget to bring a towel
76,Chris Chibnall...
77,"You can heat up beans and do some healthy cooking in a microwave. You could also buy a burner or toaster oven from the Goodwill. I think the hiring process in the US especially for jobs that earn more money might NOT be overweight friendly especially if like you say the common misconception about poor obese people is that they are lazy"". Can you join the Y, it would be free for you! And if you get healthier and eat less ramen I think you might feel more energized. You sound like you have a great head on your shoulders OP. "
78,"You never know whether something is going to become iconic or not. You simply hone something to the best of your ability and hope for the best. With that speech, I think part of the strength of it is that The Doctor tried his damnedest for peace and felt forced into war. One thing that niggles me about the speech is his naming of the Boneless. There were originally a couple of recurring bits in scenes before this where he was struggling to name them. He would overhear the cleaners call them 'Crawling Death' or somesuch and you could see him in the Tardis considering the name, then rejecting it, making his naming of them The Boneless more of the end of a process rather than a proclamation out of nowhere."
79,They will from now on. I will push as hard as I can
80,Her smile. 
81,She makes more money than I do and free rent sounds like a win to me 
82,"It's over 87 million dollars, I did the math for you."
83,"It has proven an adequate surface to rest devices such as my phone when watching Wrestling, and also to hoist my laptop. I cannot claim to have used it as a eating surface. I do fear that there would be a spill and I would find a build up of beans. Carefully arranged around my penis."
84,"Overall, I feel more energized and I have less food cravings. When I started, I weighed 235lbs and as of today, I am 209lbs. Soylent isn't meant as a weight loss supplement but it has certainly helped. 

The only negative aspects to it are that it has to be purchased online so I need to keep a close eye on my stock pile and the after taste. The flavored kind gives me an *I haven't brushed my teeth yet* taste in my mouth. 

It comes in two flavors, cocoa and nectar as well as plain. Cocoa tastes like milk chocolate, nectar tastes like lucky charms, and plain tastes like pancake batter. The plain flavor is the cheapest and I recently discovered that it tastes great with almost any flavor of Mio. 

I actually do enjoy drinking soylent. I drink it three times a day and have a healthy evening meal. On Saturdays, I let myself have McDonald's or some other fried, fattening dinner. I tried switching back to regular food with a healthy diet and I felt worse than before. My blood sugar kept dropping and I became constipated. Sorry if TMI."
85,"If it's a real game changer, it would have to be discussed at length and approved at the outline stage. Steven is the one steering the show after all.


Some stuff sneaks in almost by osmosis. I would argue that Clara as a kind of Doctor-In-Training really came into focus in Flatline. Which only occurred because it struck me as a good source of jokes that Clara would mock the Doctor while pretending to be him. Fast forward two seasons and she's flying off in a Tardis with Ashildr."
86,More like weirdos anonymous
87,"No pain, it's just incredibly difficult to aim"
88,"Why did I start this? I've suffered from an eating disorder on and off throughout my life. I started Soylent because I wanted to wean myself off of sugary, fattening foods. My goal is to teach myself to see food as a survival mechanism and not an emotional outlet. "
89,"Sorry, but it doesn't make sense. You're the writer that Moffat was in RTD's era. Chibnall would be crazy not to keep you on. "
90,I don't have to but I do.
91,"Get both, one as a meal"
92,Why did that happen and what was the tipping point where you had to be registered? 
93,Or a Grindr
