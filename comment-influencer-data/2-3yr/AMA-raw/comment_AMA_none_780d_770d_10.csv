16,"All the time. Tipping is usually done by people with lower income too which blew my mind when I first started. Rich bastards don't wanna give even a 20$ away lol. Best cash tip I've gotten was 100$.
Best food I ever recieved.... I usually decline home made food. I just don't trust anyone and my girl has made me a pretty big germaphobe. One time I was training a guy with me. Doing an install for a tiny little Asian man. He kept asking if we were hungry he would go get pizza. Proceeded to ask our favorite soft drink, then just left without notice. Came back with 2 large pepperonis and a 2 liter of both of our favorite drink. Made us take our shoes off and pray with him but we ate good. And he let us take it lol"

27,"Trigger warning, please don't read this comment further if you are suffering from ptsd or depression.






There's a lot that I have mentally blocked out so I just remember bits and pieces and how I felt. The earliest memory I have is him locking my bedroom door and undressing me. He had told me that my mom asked him to change my clothes. He started touching me and when I got uncomfortable he said he was checking to make sure I was healthy. It escalated slowly and he would always be nice about it if I didn't yell or act up. If I did he would hurt me and since he was much bigger than I was I didn't react very often. He used to make me jerk him off. Sometimes he would drag me in the bathroom during family gatherings and if someone asked he would say my mom asked that we clean it. He tried to penetrate me once but I think I was still too small and wasn't able to get in. He would suffocate me with a pillow and play with my vagina at the same time. It's still very hard for me to sleep in a bed in an empty apartment, it's when I'm most paranoid. 

I don't remember my thoughts exactly but I remember being very confused. I didn't understand what was happening for the longest time. As I got older it became normal for me so I expected it. I think it was around 11 when I figured something was wrong mostly because my religion teacher would stress how wrong sex was. I would cry myself to sleep most nights. When I was around 16 I stumbled upon an article about sexual abuse and that's when it all hit me."
28,"Sorry that your recruiter dragged you round the horn on this.  But the end result of all the messing around would have been straight forward...

MEPS would have denied you based on your hormone treatments.

I'm proud of you for being strong enough to embrace who you really are and take the steps needed to be happy with yourself, but the Military turns away thousands of people every day and they don't care if you are Trans on hormones, or Diabetic on Insulin.  Any regular medication and your out.  Sorry there are physical standards that are expected by the military and a VERY large majority of people don't meet them.  "

33,"In the later years it was impossible to have a good relationship with him.
We met three months before he died. That last time was the only time he got to meet my newborn baby.
He was so happy. Its one of my best memories ever, seeing him make an effort to be as clean, fresh and clear in the head.."

35,"Umm.... stupid question that is literally at 85% of my jobs. ""Can you get me the playboy channel? HA HA HA just kidding man,but what about like HBO? I had a buddy 30 years ago that gave me a box with all the channels.""
Worst part of my job.... Favoritism. I contract, meaning I'm not a direct employee. I get paid per job, use my own truck, buy my own gas etc. So my prime, the cable company, routes us around 4:30 a.m. Giving us the majority of jobs for the day. Most contracting companies have a single router. His/her only job is to give a base route to the techs before 730ish am. And move jobs as techs run behind/ahead throughout the day. The favoritism is the router giving bigger paying or easier apartment jobs to his/her friends. This LITERALLY affects my paychecks negatively if I'm not that favorite. Affects my livelihood, whether my family can eat or not. That's the worst part."
36,Do you want a hug?
37,"Thank you.
Yes. We have been struggling with his drug abuse since he was 15. My parents tried everything twice. All kinds of rehab. But in the end nothing helped.
The last couple of years he wasn't himself. The brain had been through so many overdoses that it was as if he became mentally handicapped, but it was only obvious to everybody else but him. "
38,"Thank you so much for this.
No one who hasn't been in the situation knows that feeling.
Yes. There have been times I wished he was dead, just make it easier for all of us. Spare us the pain he caused. Seeing my family fall apart because of him.

All those things he did. Until he mentally wasn't capable. The last years he was on a heavy daily dose of methadone. He wasn't able to speak so it made sense. Super paranoid, filled with conspiracy theories. When he called you wouldn't pick up, you just couldn't. It was to much.

That's why everybody is having such a guilt trip now when he's gone. I didn't visit him as often as I now think I should have. But remembering how it was, it was impossible. We couldn't all just set our lives on pause because of him.

He had 6-7 overdoses. He's been beaten by thugs on multiple occasions. He injected and missed his vein causing his left hand to be amputated (he was left handed). He had scars all over his body. He was really overweight. He had diabetes, had a small heart attack. 
There have been so many times I thought he was going to die, but he never did. That's why it feels so surreal that he actually is gone.
I'm sure his death will bring something good.

Thanks for the comment brother! Keep going! Your family loves you!

39,"My bio parents were neglectful, abusive, and allowed other abuse to occur that they knew about. Once a child is removed from a home, the parents have a year (in the US, could be different elsewhere) to regain custody. If not, the judge can order a termination of parental rights, which is what happened. At that point, I was up for adoption. "

50,"Recovering alcoholic and addict myself. I'm sorry for your loss. The pain is unbearable to lose a loved one. Wherever he is, I hope he's found peace being released from the grips of addiction.

My question, and not trying to sound rude but don't know how to word it more sensitively......do you find some relief from his death? 

For me, I lied, cheated and stole from my family. All the bullshit, all the fighting, all the drama. It was so so so much for my family. They were sick of it. Even when they cut me off I still managed to weasel my way back in to cause a hurricane of trouble. I'm not sure how your family dynamic is but in my experience with the life, it's easier to deal with the pain from loss than the roller coaster ride of hell."

54,"I give so much of my energy and soul to other people. At times it's hard to deal with sights that I see at work, balancing life at home and being truly happy.

71,"Its not awkward and never really was. I called them by their first names until I was about 18ish, then it felt weird and I started calling them mom and dad. There is a ton of familial affection, I fit in from the beginning with them. I understood why I had been placed into foster care and was happy about it, but not all kids have that experience. One of my siblings aged out and went back to our bios, one was adopted but when back to our bios at 18, and one is still in care but plans to go back to our bios. Its tricky sometimes and very much depends on the child. 

I would highly recommend it! If possible, I would try to get a child who is already TPR (their parents have had their rights terminated already and do not get visitation). My parents fostered and it was tough with some of the kids who still got visitation because they would start to act out every time they saw their bio parents. "
72,My name JEFF!
73,"Dirty inside or dirty outside? Might seem like they correlate but honestly. They don't. Most inside dirty houses contain cat, human, dog feces. Bugs and just overall terrible hygiene. 
Most houses that are dirty outside are just laziness and intense material hoarding. I've seen 10 ft deep pools buried by scraps and furniture.
The worst was probably about 2 years ago. I walked into a home, inquiring of their service from us. As I walked through the door, I smelled it. Like baby poop and pee, mixed with ammonia. As I walked the house checking for cable jacks, there was about 25 people living in a 1500 sq ft home. 6 of them being small children. In the living room, it was like walking through someone's side yard, except, it wasn't dog shit I was dodging. It was human shit. And it was blatantly obvious they attempted to clean up a few piles and clean them with some windex concoction, before I arrived. 
I had to turn the job away for health reasons. "
74,"Now, depends on the type of feelings you are referring to. I share compassion with my Israeli neighbours. I live in a village named Rmeich, I can see Israel in my backyard. I have no hatred for Israel. 

Hezbollah in the 80s was the modern day ISIS, I like to say. They try to appear very modern among young Lebanese youth by claiming they are ""protecting"" Lebanon, which they are. Just yesterday they intercepted a car full of explosives. Christians, especially in the South do rely on Hezbollah to protect them and not the Lebanese army because Hezbollah is better trained, equipped and high in numbers, because of Iran. 

I share nothing but hatred among my Muslim neighbours. I have seen Arab Muslims defecting in Churches in the 80s. I believe it is important to separate ""Shiite"" militias like Hezbollah and ""Sunni"" terrorist organisations.  "
75,So sorry for your loss.  Did the family know about his addiction before?
76,"I think so. I have spoken to some of them and be like ""DUDE! You're amazingly hot, why aren't you on Tinder instead, getting it for free?""
The response is generally ""I don't want the strings attached, I just want to come here, relax and leave.""
I think there is a stigma considering my first night I got the hottest tradie! I said to reception how great he was and she's like ""yeah he's lovely isn't he, he's a regular.""
I found myself so surprised..."

87,Being dumb as fuck.
88,"Most average weird thing... people going back to bed during my morning installs. 
I'll wake them up with a call when I'm 10-20 min out. They fall back asleep. I bang on door, wake them up again. They give me a lack luster walk around the house and go back to bed. Idk about these customers but I don't trust anyone. No way I'd fall asleep with a service tech at my home. But honestly it happens way to often. And it's awkward as fuck. Working 3 ft away from somebody sleeping hoping they don't trip out if I wake them up."
89,"So varied! A lot of Indian men. A lot of working class guys. Hot younger guys. Hot older men! Retireees with money to spend.
During the day, tradies rock up on their lunch breaks... late at night you get the ""group of guys on a night out."" Drunk idiots are my least favourite. There is no drinking in the brothel which helps. I have had one Asian guy so far. I have had a few that felt more like a first date! Just cool guys around my wage that I really got along with."
90,Hey now
91,"So, did you get your $20 back when you demanded a refund?"

95,Shitty. Fuck him 
96,This would be a legit answer from me
97,Did you end up having a heart to heart conversation with a hot chick while you were up there like in the movies? 
98,"&gt; Even though they've terrorised your country

That is the common view among Lebanese today. This is why I said, it depends on what type of feeling you are referring to. As a Christian, Israel helped Lebanese Christians during the civil war. They did not terrorise Christians. If it was not for the support of Israel, Lebanese Christians would have diminished. I recommended looking at the March 14 political party.

&gt; I imagine it's difficult to hate 70% of the population.

Firstly, Christians are larger than 30%. And we do not hate the 70%. Like I said, Christians in Lebanon do not share hatred with Shiites. We both have a common ideology that numerous Sunni Muslims want to kill Christians and Shiites. It is much a complicated issue that hating on the 70% of the population. "

112,Did we just become best friends?!
113,"I was put into foster care at 11. I lived in home 1, then home 2, then home 1 again, then home 3. I was 13 when placed in home 3, and I was adopted at 14 by my parents there. I'm 23 now. I do talk to them occasionally and I have younger siblings so I stay in touch with them. "
