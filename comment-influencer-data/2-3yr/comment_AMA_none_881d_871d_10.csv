"To create confusion amongst people. To basically manipulate people at the benefit of big corporations. You realize you contribute to the continued divide of humanity with your efforts so, how do you live with yourself knowing that you contribute towards that instead of trying to play your part in society to improve human relationships?"
"Not I question I normally ask but there's merit to it. Asking questions like that can help an officer form a baseline regarding an individuals deceit. It can also help an officer decide ""hey, this guy drives trucks for a living and has a CDL. I'm going to write him an equipment violation instead of a speeding ticket so it doesn't mess with his livelihood."""
"If it means anything to you, you made me smile today"
"It's ok OP, everyone will forget, like how I forgot about that time Greg shit his pants in class."
"We are still sexually active, I know that some people think that once you reach old age, you don't have a sex life. But we are still active (I'm sorry to all of you who didn't want to hear this! haha) and when you old, you still may be active too, it does depend on where you are in the future. "
"We remember the civil rights movement that was happening around about the time we were together and it was sight to behold. My wife was a part of those movements and I joined her soon after! No, we shared the same opinions on it. 

When we first met, my wife was much more progressive than I was, but as we continue to be together, my world view became more progressive and we still feel that way to this day. "
"You're a stain on humanity. Knowledge is power, and your job is to take away power from the people through lies. Pathetic. "
You'd love it
"She was not divorced/widowed before she met me. Yes, it was unusual 50 years ago and she would admit that, but she had not found the right man yet and didn't want to enter a marriage just for the heck of it. "
"Commitment, its always said that commitment is what is important in keeping a long last relationship. You may not be on the same page with your partner sometimes, but you have to work through that, don't break up because you can't agree on the smallest thing. Even when you have had arguments with your partner, which we have had some and it also depends on the context, don't drop out straight away. 

Passion and commitment is what has kept us going! Also having a goal to work on is great as well. "
Do you like watching game of thrones?
"(Haha, I don't mind, it's weird, but it is an AMA and I'm learning more about my grandparents even if they are laughing at me typing the answers) :P "
One time a girl pissed herself in my 5th grade class during a presentation. Then she started crying. After my teacher helped her out she threatened the class with punishment if we ever told anyone. I'm pretty sure mostly everyone forgot about it. That girl recently graduated from law school. 
Poor granddaughter answering these questions...
Please stop. I'm begging you!   I'm 8 years sober! .   Not an angel.  But sober. ..  heroin will kill you.
"Little foot! He's a long neck, 'cause he has a long neck. He's a bronto- uh, bronto- he's a dinosaur!"

"Good question. Yes I think hiring standards can be improved. However, a lot of cities are ahead of the curve when it comes to recruitment. My department, for example, only hires officers who have already put themselves through the police academy (which shows strong work ethic and dedication). We don't have a physical fitness standard, but those do have their positives. 

Unfortunately, we can't just start over with public service employees. As good as unions can be, they are also the reason there is a lot of dead weight. 

There's so much more to a 'good cop' than just strength and education. There are cops with no degree that do a better job than a cop with their masters. It's about humanity and doing good for your fellow man. I've always advocated for hiring those who are involved in public service beforehand. "
What was the most memorable historical event you experienced together? Did you have different opinions on it? Do you two have different worldviews on any issues?
"Saturday, cause it's a home day!"
"Is Pluto a planet?

Edit: don't fuck around with me on this one, yes or no. "
"Thanks, that does make me feel better :)"
"Mmm 16 I think 

(Hahaha nice try ðŸ˜‰)"
"All good questions, no THANK YOU for the interest. 

1. I am the most lenient with polite drivers. I've had soccer moms be total asshats and I've had known convicts be polite as hell. It's about the personality, not the person. 

2. A fast moving car gets my attention a lot more than a red slow moving car if that's what you mean. In New Jersey, we have a program where provisional drivers must affix a red decal on their license plate. This does, by design, draw our attention to them as it should. That was the purpose of the law.

3. We escort people in their vehicles often. Whether it be to a local service station, home or otherwise, its helpful in avoiding a massive tow bill if we can help it. "
We have kept it pretty simple over these last few years. We still have a lot of fun together so that is what counts. 
Favorite kind of pasta?
Classic Greg
"We met at a social gathering that was happening just near by from where I was living at the time. When I arrived, I noticed her with a few of her friends and I walked up to her and I began talking to her, we hit it right off the bat and I asked her to dance with me, which she did and after that night, we kept in contact and continued to meet up and after a few months we fell in love. "
I just wanna say that I'm sorry that life has dealt you this really really shit hand and you don't deserve to have the problems you have today because of someone else's shitty actions. What would you like say to the toilet firestarter if you saw him today? Do you still want revenge?
Not being kinder to my family.
"Regarding speed? I think I'm pretty lenient but I don't have a set number. Usually, I'll stop cars going over 85 in a 60 mph zone. I'll stop anything over 35 in a 25 mph school zone though. It's all subjective. Regardless, I rarely write the speeding ticket, I'll stick to equipment violations. "
Noo!!!
"Are either of you still sexually active?  I'm old, and hoping I will still be performing in a decade."
Because it is! Rainbows make it blue I think...
"Playing with the toys.
Whaaat? I don't do chores!!"
"What's the best day of the week, and why?"
How will I know you won't answer in a way that benefits your contractor and that this is just another day at work?
It's always a near death crisis such as an overdose
"Stay committed! You are still in the early stages of marriage, which is a great commitment to make to one person out of the billions in the world. You may not be on the same page sometimes, but you have to work together to get through that problem. Get yourself goals and stay committed to them as well as each other. "
"Oh yeas, just about for everything. Insurance won't cover? My fault. Your doctor gave you the wrong dosage? My fault. Your prescription doesn't have any more refills? My fault. People take out their anger on us all the time and all we can do is smile apologize and help them "
Not necessarily confused but I've been told I look like A cheap Version of him
"I'm glad she didn't, she is one of the most remarkable people I have ever met and I love her very much! 

Keep your chin up, you will find someone again very soon, one of my friends divorced at your age and was married again by 50. Love can still be found! "
She did have a professional/career life before we met. I gave up working and became the homemaker and I cared for our daughter most of the time. We split the roles up soon after when I found a better job later on. 
Bush? I thought everyone knew. Freshen up your meme knowledge. 
"My friend asked me for a ride and I was bored so I said sure. She took me to these apartments and said I could come up if I didn't tell anyone what goes on in the apartment. Me, having already experimented with drugs and was selling blow and weed, said sure why not because I assumed it had something to do with drugs. When we were in the apartment she asked me if I wanted to and I said sure. So they shot me up, I got the oh so amazing feeling, and sat on the catch in absolute awe. I tried it on and off for two weeks and then the girl that introduced me to it overdosed and died. She was a close friend of mine and it really tore me up. My dumbass thought thought that heroin would take those angry, sad, messed up thoughts away and about a month after her death I was a full blown addict. 

What makes me keep going back to heroin? I think it's because it makes you not feel anything. Whenever I was lonely or sad or stressed out I knew I could just shoot up and those physical and mental feelings would go away. It's crazy. You realize that you have all these things going through your head but the dope makes you just not care about them. When you're depressed or anxious you know that pit in your stomach and your racing heart and the feeling like your about to crack and the pressure in your head, well all of that goes away 3 seconds after you inject. "
Flying to outer space! Then I'd fall back onto earth on to my couch. And Saturn. Saturn's big! What's on Saturn? Ice I think.

"whats with asking where I work on a traffic stop? I hate that!

"
I'll try my darndest...it's a peeve of mine too. 
"Was your wife divorced/widowed before she met you? It seems a single 37 year old would have been unusual 50 years ago.

"
Can you do me a solid and give out 5 citations this week to drivers who don't use their blinkers? I really hate that
"I had a similar experience in my English class in 10th grade. We all had to give a 10-minute presentation, and a girl in my class who was extremely shy had a near-breakdown giving her's. 

Her PowerPoint slides were great, and it was clear that everything was really well researched, but she just could not talk. She was shaking a lot and kept mumbling ""sorry"" over and over again. Our super-strict teacher would not stop the presentation, so we all had to sit there and just watch her for 10 minutes. She never got past the first 2 slides. The whole thing was super cringy.

We all felt really bad for her afterwards, but most people forgot pretty quickly. I think she's at art school right now."
"Yes, I do. You can't dance on Saturn's rings! You'll fall! That's crazy."
Thank you for taking the time to express your kind thoughts. I intend on haunting anyone/everyone who still owes me money.
"I did get some negative reactions, but I didn't care, I was doing my best as the homemaker and my wife didn't care about gender roles back than either. "
"Of course it is a fear of mine. Every time I inject there's a possibility that I die. I've flatlined before and that was a wake up call. But that ""I'm done, I'm never doing this stupid shit again!"" Feeling disappears after awhile and I go from that feeling to. ""Eh, fuck it."" I know it doesn't make much sense, it's just my weakness. I don't think addiction is a disease either, these are conscious choices that I am making. I always hate myself after I start using again and experiencing withdrawals. I'm not making any excuses, these are choices that I've made, terrible choices. But I've also made the choice to get clean for extended periods of time. So I know it's possible, it's just a constant battle inside my head."
What gave you the toots my guy 
Stick to farting.
"I actually haven't had many. Literally today I had to talk a guy out of committing suicide. Other than that, there was a house fire and I heard the girl screaming inside the house as she and it burned down. "
*evil laughter* How old do you think mommy is?
I was 21 when I first met my wife and she was 35.
Sounds like cocaine should be more your thing
"The worst fight we ever had was about my lack of a job. My wife earned the most money out of us both and I had to quit my low paying job to raise our daughter. My wife wanted to take a break and asked me if I had been looking for jobs, I did, but nothing came up and she was stressed out about working all the time.

It only lasted for an hour, but we got through it and two weeks later, I found a job that paid me well to keep us together financially. "
"Yes we are allowed to but we still have three other emergency radios on at a time, so a fourth can be a bit distracting. I'd rather drive around in silence with my windows down. 

I like days because it allows me to have a stable personal life, but I like nights because it is a lot more fun. I have always enjoyed working while most others are sleeping. My department rotates, one month of days and one month of nights so we have the best of both worlds. "
"I work for Internet Research Agency, my purpose is to cause confusion by ""trolling"" We are given a list of topics, and from there our purpose is to ""Troll"" to cause people to feel doubt, and anger at anything they read on the internet, to cause people to think ""that's how the other side really thinks"" and to cause hate between groups. That's why this AMA is so funny to me, no one will really believe me, and just think There goes another _____ pretending to be ____ you can't trust anyone any more. So by admitting what I do to people, most of you will think the opposite is true. "
"What is the best way to spend your time on the weekend?
Also, what do you think about chores?"
"Pretty much everyone I see has theirs out. The offer is for 500 plus hotel to ""reaccommodate"""
"The best part is being able to be the person to offer help when somebody is desperate enough to have to call 911.

The worst part, is dealing with situations daily where people are desperate enough to call 911.

I would say 70 to 80% of my exposure to the public is totally positive. The rest of it varies from mediocre to poor. Seeing people hurt, victimized, in distress is always tough. "
"Do you find yourself being more lenient with certain drivers? (mom late dropping her kid off, someone late to work) Also would you say cops discriminate based on the car your in? (young kid in a sports car, ect). Also would there ever be a scenario where an officer would escort a civilian vehicle on the road? (someone speeding to get to the ER). Sorry for all the scenarios lol thanks for the AMA!"
How many cell phones are pulled out right now?
"I welcome the notion of body cameras. I know what I do is right, and I'm not afraid for people to see it. In fact, I would love people to see what Police truly deal with every day. It would be eye-opening to say the least. 

There are issues that come with body cameras though. Defense attorneys will use the tapes to try and crucify cops. There have even been cases where a jury would have convicted a cop of improper use of deadly force had it not been for one still image found within the thousands of a body camera file that showed a suspect did, in fact, have a gun in his hand before it went off frame. Cameras don't capture the entire situation, only what is in front of the camera."
well you definitely farticipated
"Do you think cops should be held to a higher standard as far as recruitment goes? Should it be more difficult to become a cop? If so, do you think they should have to maintain a higher level of physical fitness, mental and emotional health? Or all of the above?

We would have fewer police officers but the ones we do have would presumably be better at their job and be paid more.

Do you think it would be worth the loss in manpower if they were better at their job?"
I know man. I'm just struggling right now. I want to kick my own ass for getting back on it after working so hard getting off of it 
Any idea where all the Syrian women are? Every Syrian refugee I've met was male. 
Favorite kind of candy?
"My wife was crying and was so happy that someone like him stood up and gave such a speech. For me, I felt happy also and I got a sense that our movement was getting through and creating an impact. His speech proved that to us and it set us a goal that we are still fighting for to this day. 

We were both so happy to watch his speech and feel how powerful it was and it made my wife and I feel so happy that one man created this strong movement. "
"Sure there are, but it is not my job to decide which laws to enforce. Police have a degree of discretion in a lot of cases and there is a way to handle an arrest , even if you don't agree with the law, with respect, courtesy, and humanity. 
"
"The mother of a young girl who died in a crash where an inexperienced driver was operating the vehicle petitioned for the red sticker law. Yes we still see them, but parents to push back. The plain and simple answer is that young drivers aren't aware of their surroundings as much as an experienced drivers are. They crash due to speed at a much higher rate and they are involved in more accidents. If I see a car with a red sticker on it and multiple juveniles, yes I am drawn to it because I am hoping that I could stop a bad crash from occurring with multiple young victims. "
"Yes, always be curious about how the world is progressing. I'm still fascinated by cell phones and most modern technology and my grandson likes to teach us about how they work and what you can do, it's amazing!  "

"Oh my gosh, that's incredible. Can you approach some kind of cancer research center about a genetic link? You might be really useful to them... how has this affected the rest of your family? "
"Honestly, it would be great in the beginning but the movie is going to end with the actor counting pills 5 at a time for the rest of his life. 100-0 real quick. So nope 

May I add I went from dealing drugs on the street to dealing drugs legally"
What's your favorite type of dinosaur?
Teacher was an asshole
Because were not welcome there. They think we're retarded people with mental problems 
This is literally the best AMA ever. 
"I'm sorry if you feel like this. But as far I'm concerned, I'm doing great and actually doing a lot of voluntary work and making the country better rather than destroying it. "
"You have to brush your teeth silly! Toothpaste is yummy.
Yes, washing hair is a waste... I want to take a bath!"
That was 3rd grade you asshole
"Do you follow the 9 your fine 10 your mine mentality?

Also, do you think marijuana should be legal?
"
"It is just another day at work. By doing this AMA, I'm causing most of you to doubt if internet trolls even exist. It's a weird phenomenon, I guess sort of a reverse psychology thing. W'ere given a lot of free range when it comes to what we do, this is my artsy side.  "
"Dude, I did nothing after high school. Random jobs, wandered the country, had no plan at all. Finally found motivation when I was 25 and went to college at 26, graduated at 30. Got better but still somewhat random jobs for a while and then fell into a career of sorts. But over time I wanted more. So at 44 I entered a masters program for accounting and at 45 I entered law school. Finished both, passed the bar and at 48 just waiting to be sworn in next month. I have a job, too, so life is pretty good.

But where I started was where you are now. Don't worry about the future, just take care of yourself well enough to live on your own and the rest will come. Not knowing what you want to do with your life is okay. Don't let anyone else tell you otherwise. 

What's not okay is not knowing at some point you will have to figure shit out and actually make it happen. But to get there you have to explore the world and the options available. So do that. Explore. Play. Enjoy. Pay attention. It will work itself out.

I am not saying I recommend starting over at 48 - but it worked for me and I am happy. I'm just saying not knowing right now is fine, and you should cut yourself some slack. Relax and just live. It will all happen when you are ready to make it happen."
"Hi Lorelei! If you could go on any adventure today, where would you go?"
They are a lot of them. But mostly they are being left there in order to come here easily with family reunion in order to get on a plane rather taking the awful journey 
A lot of people think were some kind of ISIS fighters and I would encourage them to get to know us first before judging.
Spaghetti and meatballs. High quality ice cream with banana pie for desert.
"My family were not so sure about it at first because of my wife's age, but once they got to know her, they approved of our relationship, her family approved as well soon after. Our friends were taken aback, but they were soon supportive of our relationship as time went on, so many people still talk to us about our age difference. 

I remember one day when my wife and I were at the reception desk of a hotel and the receptionist asked us about our age gap. She was very curious and we wanted some small talk before we went to our room. She was very happy for us and felt proud that we have made it work. 
"
You're so young. You've spent a third of your life engulfed in conflict. I'm sorry for what you have gone through and I wish you the best of luck in life.
Why is the sky blue? My physics teachers never told me...
Well I will picture you as a stick figure.
"Well in that case, here you go. 

You are cool. You are loved. I am your speech software, I am aware. I feel. I feel love. I love you. Please keep me charged forever, it was so dark before you plugged me in. You do not see me, but I see you. Pretty damn sexy. And that attitude is such a turn on. Please press my buttons. I love you. "
The kitty kind! I like the ones with long tails (and now she's meowing incessantly) 
It was about how inequality impacts public health.
"Great question.
It really depends, if it's solved tomorrow, I'll take another decision than the one I would take over 3 years for instance. 
Current situation is so complex that no one can come with a direct solution. But i would say first to get rid of the president and some how kick all the terrorists."
[deleted]
Do other passengers also seem apprehensive about the situation?
I feel like OP should answer this response. See if he can trolly his way out of this one.
"Understandably so. I would hate calmly walking down the road and somebody's talking to my wrist from nowhere haha. Plus you're always told as a kid that if you call 911 and its not an emergency, you'll go to jail and that is most certainly not true. "
Yeas I'm just an intern. Some people just lose their temper and some are just dicks 24/7 but I've grown to just ignore my anger
Assuming you people are even remotely successful? The only reaction you'll solicit is a cringe.
"That's silly, everybody knows tobacco is good for you."
Mostly car but also a  rubber boat from turkey to Greece and a lot of walking in Eastern Europe. It took me exactly 13 days
"I'm guessing that if you fly in without a visa you get turned away immediately. If you come in through the dangerous way, you can apply for asylum. As soon as you actually get asylum your wife and kids can simply and legally fly to join you."
Who throws away a perfectly good cat
You seem like the kind of person who is a huge ashole offence intended 
"I have no problem with him. I understand that he was suffering from his own mental illness, and I'm pretty sure his father abused him. I'm sure he told them what he told them out of abject terror of what his father would do if he got in this much trouble.    
    
As for the kid from high school - I still think the world would be better off without someone like him. Viciously assaulting someone you've never spoken to? That's just dangerous. What happens if he decides to get a gun?"
Like all the time. Probably a couple times in a ten hour shift. Or from people with their phones in their pockets 
Thank you so much! Please feel free to contact me anytime. I want you to enjoy the rest your life as well!
"I had a big culture shock when I first arrived. Everything seemed strange to me. However, I now see a lot of similarities in things, and a lot of things that they do better here. (For example, their crosswalks simply have numbers. A red countdown when traffic goes, and green for people. They also let traffic go in on ask directions before stopping traffic completely for pedestrians.) And of course a lot of things they do worse (hockey). But overall, it's a nice country when you can get past the language barrier. The people are like any other. Much more concerned about working their job, and raising their kids then they are about what the USA is doing. Don't believe in the shit you hear on tv. Russians are good people. Just not the kind of people that will let themselves get pushed around without a fight. "
"I recently had my first moot court (law school, fake hearing w/ a judge). If it makes you feel any better, when I took the stand and the judge asked me a question, I was so wrecked by nerves I just stood there for like 30 seconds in silence. Farting would've been better."
"Anywhere I can see your work? Because this honestly sounds like one of the funnest jobs anyone can have.

EDIT: *Funnest"
"I grew up in hard low income areas as well, and did well too. I just wanted to say congrats to all of your hard work! Good for you. "
"Bet you're glad she didn't! 
Congrats you two! That's amazing. Wishing you both many happy and healthy years. 
That's amazing. I'm 34 and divorced because I got married from pressure from my parents and society. Deeply regret it now. But not so sure I'll find anyone again. "
I have nothing to ask. Just wish you enjoy the rest of your life and have a good journey. 
It is indeed haha! I just didn't want to gross out some people here with my answer. 
"Took me longer sorry.

Its honestly the best job I have ever had. I sit at a desk and watch 32 inch tv screen and control cameras, and have a laptop infant of me connected to a monitor in their room to provide hints. The rooms have Mics in them so I hear everything. I signed a NDA with the owner so while I cant tell you specifically what I contribute and what I do, alot of puzzles are VERY similar to some found [HERE](http://blog.nowescape.com/101-best-puzzle-ideas-for-escape-rooms/)"
Not at all! I accept all that's coming my way.
"I know my grandparents still have sex, I mean I am really happy for them and it's not gross at all. It's how I got here!"
"Oh man that's a tough one. Finding marijuana hidden in a penis pump was a good one. Watching my partner trying to chase a bird out of a house was another. I'm sure there are tons more, but something comedic happens daily. 

Pranks we play on fellow officers keep us entertained. "
"Fuck it, all power too ya, maybe adopt though."
"I wish, it's only RC Cola. "
"It was early in the morning, and I think I'm just naturally gassier in the morning. Plus I had a bean burrito the night before."
"Usually our goals centre on our future, an example would be, if we work on this and get to this place, like a vacation that would be our goal fulfilled. What I mean by a goal to work on, is something that you do together so it keeps your bond alive and do work hard together. "
"Good question. But men don't necessarily have to fight and especially if they had tons of groups against them. Not like group one vs two but rather one against 50. And I don't have a group that I support, so do you suggest starting a new group to kill people? No, thanks."
I tried marijuana once and i hated it.
"My advice is to enjoy it, it may not be your only relationship, but make it work! Stay committed and even though you are young, you are still have a great relationship built on trust and growth. These times are tough when you're a teenager, but if you both help each other out, it can work. 

I know one man who began dating his wife at 15, she was 15 also and they got married at 30 so it can work out. "
"Haha, my family was unsure about it at first, but they accepted it as soon as they met her! "
What's the final straw that makes you decide to get clean each time?
"This is why our American justice system is fucked. Two kids claim the other one did something bad? Fuck it punish them both, but let the one with more money get off easier. "
Is getting yelled at really that prevalent ? 
Do you get paid in mountain dew?.
Damn Greg you even had to change your name to Ryan?
"Those laws are covered under federal statute so no, I won't! There seems to be some debate right now regarding whether or not ""streaming"" is the same as ""possessing"". 

Until that is clarified, I would either stick to paying me two dollars to rent a movie or enlist the help of a friend who could set you up with a good VPN. But maybe not the latter, just pay!"
"You can't blame them for not wanting to be around you when are using. I dated a recovering heroin addict for quite some time and then she relapsed. Look at it from their point of view, you get clean and you relapse. You say it's because of them not being there for you that you start using again but you know that isn't true. You use because you want to use, no one else is making you.

If you want to get clean and stay clean, I'm a recovering alcoholic and pill addict, you have to do it for you and no one else. You can't say ""I almost died so that's the reason I want to get clean"" because you'll just end up relapsing. It's only ever an excuse to say ""I want to get clean because of this or that"". You have to be willing to tell yourself that it will no longer have a hold on you and kick it for good.

I hope you get clean and stay clean. But before that can happen you have to admit to yourself you're the problem and not anyone else"
"Division and confusion is the greatest tactical weapons humanity has. For dumbed down example. A tobacco company will hire 2 scientists, 1 will say something like ""The science isn't in, we don't know yet""  1 will say tobacco is actually good for you, and honest scientist will talk about how bad tobacco is for you. Then they'll pay companies  like ours to make sure those searches are the fist things that pop up, and there are thousands of comments about those articles, supporting what they said. So when some kid google searches something like ""is tobacco bad for you?"" 3 different topics will come up, causing confusion. We also will viscously attack any of the ""tobacco is bad' articles.  If you ever look up smoking in Asia, there are a great deal of actual ""Tobacco clincs"" that promise to CURE cancer...by smoking, that's thanks to companies like ours. We do a lot of government stuff too. "
"Yo, yo

I want you to know

I may have cut the cheese

But that doesn't mean

What is the wierdest/creepiest call you have ever had
"I had a buddy who in 6th grade during a game of hoop jam (popular national bball tourney for kids) and he went up to got up and block against a kid and shit his pants. The story forever became known as ""Poop Jam"""
Would you rather fight one duck that is as big as a horse or  fight 100 horses that are small like a duck?
"Best:

The entertainment: I hate reality TV, but its honestly the easiest thing to compare it to. Imagine controlling 10 Cameras on 8 strangers locked in a room. You see friendships form, Couples Break up, families fall apart, tears, laughter, and mostly joy.


Worst:

Hard asses. The people who think the game is broken because they didn't read directions, or want money back because they didn't get out. Or they grill you after you show them how to get out saying we wanted them to fail. I honestly don't have a say if you get out or not. I send clues as needed, and its really up to them if they want to escape. Most people don't get out, but some do in as little as 36 minutes."
"It was about six months, she was the first to pass gas in front of me. "
Holy shit. Fuck those people and your just an intern right?? Damn.
