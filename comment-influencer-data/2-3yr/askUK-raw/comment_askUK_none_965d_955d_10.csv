"Never attribute to malice, that which is adequately explained by stupidity. 

Your co-worker is a moron, not a bullshitter. "
"The BBC.

The only problem is, because they require so much verification before they publish, they can be a bit behind the times. But if reliability is what you're after then they're really hard to fault. I would just bear in mind that they appear to have a slight left wing tilt when it comes to American politics, but that's mostly because our centre is to the left of yours. Also they have a tendancy to be slightly paternal/colonial when it comes to news about less developed countries.

This is all editorial tone though; they will never knowingly publish falsehoods, and even unknowingly is unlikely. Do be aware of some subtleties of phrasing also. Like they might say 'it is claimed' when they don't really know what's happening but they want to keep up. But if you read it carefully and as a person capable of high school reading comprehension you should be fine.

Having said all that, most of the top-level UK media is very good. There are stringent no-bias requirements on TV broadcasters, so Channel 4 and ITV are not bad also (Channel 4 used to be famed for its political analysis though I think that's slipped recently). Big broadsheet newspapers are actually also not that bad -- The Times (right) and The Guardian (left) in particular. However, they have a much more pronounced editorial bias. I think The Guardian is a bit more biased that The Times but tbh that might just be my own bias seeping in. Ignore the Daily Mail, The Sun, The Mirror, and anything with a red top though. I wouldn't even use those as toilet paper out of fear of getting some kind of anal infection."
"Hershey's chocolates. I'm kinda glad it's not really taking off in the UK unlike Oreo's which gets stocked everywhere.

Twinkies also gets a ""is this it?"" grade considering at one point it was going for at least a tenner a box when they announced they were stopping production.

Also, wonderful reddit app. Posts several of the same comments after lagging. Sorry."

"Biscuits and gravy.

I know it's not actually a pile of Hobnobs sitting in a pool of Bisto but that's the image the phrase immediately brings to mind, for a Brit. And who'd want to eat that?"
A chocolate biscuit perhaps?
"Definitely acceptable, but don't you miss the almost sexual ecstasy when you break into the yolk with a piece of sausage?"

"call as long as you want, there is no time limit, no number limit at all. as you know they are there to help and will try to help every time you call them. people want things to get better for you. hell even me, a stranger on the internet wants for things to get better for you. 

don't worry about how many times you've spoken to them if you feel you need to talk call them. they want to speak."

"I believe there is at least four categories.

1. Chocolate Bar: Mars, Twix, Marathon etc. (Anything full or part covered in chocolate that you would possibly buy on its own from the corner shop.)  
2. Chocolate biscuit* bar: Penguins, Clubs, Viscounts etc (Anything full or part covered in chocolate that you would normally buy in a multi-pack that are individually wrapped (that you buy to share at work but end up eating in your car then stuffing the evidence under your seat)) 
(*They don't necessarily have to have biscuit in them, Tunnock’s Caramel Wafer fall into this category)    
3. Chocolate biscuit: Digestives, Hobnobs (king of biscuits!) etc (Anything that is Part covered in chocolate that come in a packet but not wrapped individually)
4. Biscuit: Rich tea, Malted Milks Custard Creams (Anything without chocolate*. in other words pointless.)
(*Bourbons even though are chocolate flavored don't really have proper chocolate on the so are relegated to the biscuit division)

so to answer your question I believe they are a Chocolate biscuit bar.
Any other chocolate based questions i'll be happy to answer until diabetes catches up to me and kills me off.

"All the fake cheese is absolutely rancid.

"&gt; How tough are driving instructors on their students?

You mean driving tests? I wouldn't say they're very tough, but they can fail you quite easily for something you may have missed, like reversing and someone steps off the kerb, or driving too close to the kerb, coming to a complete stop at an empty roundabout when you don't need to, things like that. A safe and confident driver can pass without a problem.

&gt; people seemingly live such good lives on such low salaries?

We pay higher taxes, so get a lot of the things that the North American's don't for free - such as healthcare (where we don't have additional insurance payments to make) and schooling (all the way up to university level, you can get loans if eligible). Anything we take home, is ours, we don't pay any extra tax at the end of the year (apart from those on self-assessment), the rest of our taxes are built in, such as VAT (equivalent to your sales tax), so we always have a better handle on our cash flow.

So, if we know we'll have £500 left after pay day (after all costs go through), you can plan the rest of your month easily. Also, having access to credit, such as overdrafts, helps. Alot of people live in their overdrafts.

&gt; my friends on these salaries have a car, a decent flat and an overall decent quality of life. 

Where in the UK? Out of London is completely different to inside London as your salary can go much further, although lower.

&gt; put up with such long commutes

We have to. Although, from my time in the US, you guys call a 6 hour journey a road-trip. 6 hours will get us across the country, but it will be hell (if you take the M1).

People go to the big metropolitan areas to find work, so companies go there, which means more people go there, which means more companies go there etc.

However, finding a place to live isn't always easy, or it's cheaper/easier to commute from further out.

A friend of mine had an hours commute on the London Underground every day to get to work, living in a shared flat.

He got married, moved out to the sticks, and his journey is now 50 minutes door to door, cost of the train is a bit more, but his mortgage is a lot less compared to his rental costs, and he now has a huge 3 bedroom house that he can call his own.

&gt; all the cars in the UK is such great condition.

I think in America, cars are an expectation as opposed to a necessity or luxury. Where it becomes an expectation, I have noticed a ""throw-away"" culture, i.e. get rid of this, and get another. It may be a necessity in America as well, as you don't really invest in your public transport/infrastructure, but I think that's as a result of the expectation to have a car, as opposed to things like inability to develop infrastructure.

Whereas, in the UK, if you need one, then you will take care of it because it's your only method of transport (such as in the country side or near the coast) and another won't always be easily available. And if it's a luxury, then you'll take care of it as it's a huge expense.

Also, we get screwed over by car insurance costing so much, so we're more careful about our driving in general.

&gt; [And we have yearly MOTs to make sure our cars are roadworthy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/5sdtuy/hey_raskuk_i_just_moved_to_the_uk_a_few_months/ddeaq01/)"
"The Beeb. One of the most compelling reasons to trust the BBC, aside from the fact that they are obliged to verify pretty much anything that they go public with, in my opinion is that all sides of the political spectrum complain that it favours the other side.

Tories call it pro-Labour, Labour call it a Tory mouthpiece, capitalists call it a socialist stronghold and socialists say it kowtows to the capitalists. I think it says a lot that what they report annoys all politicians and their followers alike. The only one with any valid point was Lord Sutch's cat, who said meow."
"&gt; An optician is obliged to provide you with the written prescription following the eye examination. You are then able to take the prescription to another practice. 

&gt; By law, the prescription must provide the basic results of the eye examination. There are however other measurements or results which are needed to dispense glasses but these will need to be taken by the 'dispensing practice' (practice where you buy the glasses). This can sometimes cause difficulties when purchasing online but the law does not require the examining optometrist to include these details as they may vary depending on the type of frames and lenses selected.

"Call them as much as you need to.It's also worth noting you can call your GP surgery up at around 8am in the morning and say you need an emergency appointment for that day as you're in a mental health crisis. They will save several appointments a day for people who need it urgently. You can also walk into your A&amp;E at any time if you're thinking about hurting yourself and they will get you onto emergency mental health treatment. This may be a hospital in-patient stay in really extreme cases (like if you are feeling suicidal and think if you go home you won't be around tomorrow) but can also just be someone to talk to + medication.

Remember mental health is as serious as physical health. If you broke your arm you wouldn't sit around waiting - you'd get it treated now, don't be afraid to insist that it's an emergency, you will be taken seriously especially if you have started self harming."
And we have MOTs which ensure the car is in a somewhat OK shape at least once a year.

"That's the origin of the phrase ""to give a lift"". And have you ever wondered why learning new skills is referred to as ""training""? It's because it elevates your skill level, just like a train elevates your floor level."
I think quite a lot of the stuff on Man vs Food upsets me just because I think it's an utter waste of food. Why make something so spicy it's designed to make someone chuck? Eating something that spicy isn't *enjoyable*. Selling inedible food as a 'dare' is just fucking moronic.
The problem is that we don't have sausage cream gravy so we have no frame of reference for what that tastes like. 
"Eating Hershey's tastes identical to vomiting normal chocolate.

American bread is weird too. It's not unpleasant on its own, but it's sweet like cake, so terrible for sandwiches."
"HMRC. I believe they'll take an anonymous tipoff because they know it puts jobs at risk.

Even if you're earning more than the minimum, it affects holiday entitlement which affects your real pay and the amount of tax HMRC receives. Fuck 'em over if you can."

"The South east is the nicest bit, obviously there's London, but also we have the South Downs, which has some fantastic skiing and we have Box Hill, which is like an English version of Uluru. We also have 'the Emirates' which is the biggest library and quiet area in Europe. We have the o2 arena which is a very large oxygen tent (obviously!) And we have other historic sites of interest like lochness, Legoland and Brighton where the Cornish pasty was invented.

Don't be put off by people from the nothingy bits trying to tell you otherwise.

Also a knight from the 1600s? Which one as there were only three famous ones?

Sir Paul Gadd? Sir Harold Shipman? Or Sir Frederick West?

They each had their specialties when fighting, respectively young soldiers, older soldiers and working in a pair.

"An anecdote for you:- 

Had a French guy, his wife and daughter come into a hotel I was working at. He struggled to order from the menu in English but I waited patiently for him to do so. Took his order and then repeated it back to him in French while his daughter wet herself laughing at how he struggled for nothing. 

Problem was; he kept trying to talk with me in French everytime I passed near them and I didn't have the time to chat so just smiled and nodded at them and told them that 'my french is bad and I only know a few French phrases'. He replied in English saying ""it's shit!""....I was speechless...how rude!!.. so I repeated what he said in French and he just had a look of total shock and panic. Then i worked out what he was actually trying to say 'it's a **cheat**' meaning to say 'so you're cheating/tricking us!""(into thinking that you speak French)

Also...French with the word 'beach'. It always Comes out as "" you son of a beach!"""

This was met with near universal agreement. We accept now that biscuit vs chocolate bar isn't black and white. It's a spectrum that runs from a rich tea to a snickers.

"&gt; I probably will be staying away from The Times and The Guardian as well

Although both the Times and Guardian may be biased to the right and left, you shouldn't dismiss them. If you want in-depth, 2000 word, long-form journalism those two papers are second to none.

The BBC may be less biased, but you'll be lucky to get more than 3 or 4 paragraphs out of them."
