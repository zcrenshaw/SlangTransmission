"Slip an anonymous note into their post box along the lines of 'Keep up the loud sex, it turns me on ;)' but written in newspaper clippings. Maybe with a picture of Boris Johnson winking too? 

Although, that might be where I went wrong with my ex come to think of it."
"Call 101, explain the situation, say you believe the caller is making these calls with malicious intent.

They know who is calling. Even if the person asked to remain anonymous, they still know. Give your contact details. If you have glass that you could read a note through on your door or a window, leave a note saying that you're getting bogus calls about a break in and to contact the number listed on the report for your address before any action is to be taken. "
"Yes.

Actually go talk to the guy and be ""friendly"" with him.  Establish a habit of starting an awkward conversation every time you see him.  Then he will begin to avoid you like a normal person."
"I grew up next to 2 such people.  Our family's approach was a loud ""Morning / Evening Colin! / Doreen!"" and an ostentatious wave in their direction whenever we passed their house *whether or not we could see them watching*.  Made them look uncomfortable every time they were visible."
"You and all the other neighbours need to gather in the courtyard and when they finish, boo them to get their attention and hold up Olympic style voting cards with very low scores written on them."

"Standard practice would be to pee into the urinal and then dry it off using the air-dryer or (if provided) paper towels. This has become a lot easier with the installation of the original Dyson dryers, although the new V shaped ones are a lot more difficult to use."
Now that *is* the British thing to do.

No.

"Thetrainline.com famously apply booking fees to all bookings (that TOC websites do not) whilst also pretending that you can save money by buying from them - however they sell exactly the same cheap advance tickets you could get anywhere else.

I flat out refuse to buy tickets through them."
Unwritten - means its bullshit (even if they did tell you).
That is BS. But you need someone behind you to fight your corner. Union/CAB.

"Alright, serious answer. 

I've never known a council to ask if you've tried contacting them first. They may ask as an offhand, but I've never known them to.

For a lot of councils, you can make a complaint anonymously online. I'd suggest you put some form of contact in though, so the council can keep you updated. They will never inform your neighbours of who complained. 

Usually, they'll send you a booklet and ask you to log each disturbance. 

Don't do this silly shaming thing of 3 minutes. That's pointless. Just log when it started, when it stopped, and a summary of what it was. If you're embarrassed to write 'loud sex', write 'woman shouting' or something. 

About 6 weeks in (or when you've filled the book) they'll ask you to return it. They will have already contacted the neighbours in this time to inform them that a complaint has been made and monitoring is in place. 

Depending on the severity of the log you return, the council will decide what to do next. "

"Pretty gobsmacked that you already decided to rush out and spend a big chunk of cash without knowing what an overdraft is. 

But anyway:

1) Yes, this means that you can essentially borrow £1500 from your bank with no interest until such time as they decide that your student account is no longer a student account and reverts to a normal current account.

Dont be a fucking idiot and spend it all at once, you'll most likely need 60-100% of it dealing with actual pressing costs like rent, bills or food. 

2) Exact circumstances are everything for this. At the very least, do you have a receipt?

3,4) Apparently legit, but dont bother going the amazon/alienware route, AW is massively overpriced and you'll be far better off building your own machine. I know Novatech has an agreement with another credit company so that you can put off the payments for six months or so, but always check the T&amp;C's. I'd recommend that instead you actually figure out what kind of spec PC you need and not just buy something off the shelf because you can get away with acceptable performance with a much cheaper machine - my own gaming/computational research machine (MSc student here) cost me about £500.

In general, this post shrieks to me that you have generally thought about how much cash you're getting but not how to budget or take account of your finances. I would urge you to think about your expenses for the coming year and work out exactly what your obligations are (rent, food,bills, travel costs) before you blow a chunk of cash on stuff that, relatively speaking, doesnt matter."

"Pretending to break up (and thus submitting a fraudulent claim) would also be benefit fraud, which is not something that OP would want on their record."

"You're going to uni, you don't need to use a site! Just go on nights out, talk to people on your course etc If you're attractive or at least have a thick skin use tinder."
"Definitely do this. It's at the point of being vexatious, which is causing both you and the police an issue. They need to have a word with the person doing the reporting about wasting police time, or you need to seek legal about finding their identify and obtaining an injunction to stop them harassing you."
no 
the netherlands and the united kingdom are both within the european customs union so assuming that vat has been paid on the alcohol in the netherlands then no other duties or taxes etc apply
No one will give a shit.

"&gt; some prick will make a bogus report 

Either the person reporting is doing so in good faith, which is not a crime, or is deliberately causing waste and upset (wasting police time, harassment). Have the police said whether they're treating it as malicious? You could ask them to. 

&gt; What if I stay over with a friend or want to go on holiday?

Ask the cops to place your contact number on file?

"There's a rounds etiquette, but it's perfectly fine to not participate if you don't want to - especially if you're not drinking. Just say ""Oh, I'm not drinking, I'll just get my own"" and nobody will think any the worse of you - it's not fair to ask you to fork out for 5 pints when you're on drinks that cost £1.50"

"The wonderful actress Katherine Helmond used to tell a story about being asked to play Sibyl in an American remake of ""Fawlty Towers"". She liked the idea but wanted reassuring that it would keep the simmering anger, pettiness and deep, ingrained bitterness and frustrations of the original.  

She was assured it would except at the end of each episode there would be a new scene with Basil and Sibyl in bed where they would go over the events in the episode, draw a warm conclusion and kiss and make up.  

She declined, of course.  

I think that's the difference between our sitcoms. We put awful people in intolerable situations and laugh at their helplessness whereas Americans tend to try and empathise with the protagonists and have a happy ending.  

Same with stand-ups. Yours, on the whole, are full of confidence, even if they are bitching about things. Ours are, on the whole,  bewildered losers.  

There are lots of exceptions to these observations, of course."
