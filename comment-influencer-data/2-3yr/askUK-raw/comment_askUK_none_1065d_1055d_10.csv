"I'm going to brace myself for downvotes here, but if she's that self centred and irresponsible that she wouldn't be willing to stop smoking for the health of her child, then she's probably not cut out to be a mother."
"This warrants a phone call rather than an email. I'm sure they'll understand if you tell them the actual reason - I think you should be specific about that.

I hope your parent makes a speedy recovery. This sounds so worrying, I'm sorry. I'm sure they'll understand but seriously, phone them. "
This is the most adorable question on AskUK this year :)
"Who cares?

It's a minor issue being used to create anger and therefore sell newspapers and create clickthrough.

I am a football fan, but football and the England team are not so fucking important that they are the only way of honouring our war dead.  Why is our inept football team the focus of our national pride?

Remembrance is also meaningless if Poppies are enforced on everyone and everything for 3 weeks.  *Choose* to wear one, or don't.  We spend a lot of time talking about freedom this time of year, but apparently freedom around remembrance itself is lacking.  

(To be clear, I do usually buy and wear a Poppy, and am happy to do so.  I have also separately given money to military charities, as a cause I believe in).

**Edit** - There will be ceremonies marking Rememberance before the game.  FIFA are not banning that, just the wearing of Poppies.  "
"Given that lots of them seem baffled by the notion of deadpan delivery I'm not surprised.

Not helpful, I know, but I just wanted to have a moan."

How bizarre. Never heard anything like that before.

Fuckin' what?"
"I liven there for a year whilst studying so I'll give some small things, mostly uni related though;  
  
- Turning on a red. Not only do I have to figure out which direction cars are coming from but I can still be run over when it's my turn to go.   
  
- Needing a car to go anywhere as I did not have one.  
  
- Insane price of text books. I bought one that literally cost more than all the books in my first year in the UK.  
  
- My uni in the UK didn't have any fast food onsite. In the US they had tons *and* I was forced to buy a meal card to spend at them.  
- Weird alcohol culture. In the UK my uni threw parties first week and gave advice like ""bring extra drinks and leave your door open to make new friends"". In the US it was like ""you will be kicked out of the dorm if we find one beer"".  
- Whilst the restaurant food was delicious most store bought stuff wasn't that great.  
- Mostly just me but I'm a guy named Ashley and fuck me if Ashley isn't the most common girls name for my age. Having my name read out as 'Miss Surname' in front of 200 people was pretty funny. "

"I'm so confused - it shouldn't be possible to get a pay rise and receive less - all the deduction are percentage based, so what you've written doesn't make any sense to me, unless you've just started paying student loan or pension and weren't before or something.

you need to break down your payslips to before and after and see what has changed, because something is not right here.

"Volunteer?

Could lead to skills (and a job, if you want one) and friendships. Even if not, you will be able to go to bed thinking you made some bit of the world a bit better, and just did something.

I have literally no idea what a video game parlour is. Is this an American thing?
"Yes.  I've experienced it with American visitors to the UK.  Not so much those who live here (there are many in London) presumably because they get accustomed to the communication differences.

I've been accused of being patronising when making smalltalk or banter, and there also seems to be a tendency to take me seriously when I'm joking."
It's not even an accurate depiction of people. Or food.

"I think what this really translates to is the fact that Americans and Brits might both speak English, but we have entirely different social codes. The mistake is assuming that English is enough. When you're speaking to (e.g.) a French person or a German, you expect those little misunderstandings and awkward moments. But Brits assume that they understand Americans because they've seen Friends, and Americans assume that they understand Brits because they've seen QI or Downton Abbey. So you're not expecting to come up against misunderstandings and when you do, it's very jarring."
"It's a competitive market. If someone publicly expresses their political opinion, it's completely reasonable that that might tip someone to using a competitor instead. They don't own your custom."
"Oh dear, I'm so sorry; I hope your parent's OK :(

I don't claim any great experience in such matters either, but I would definitely say that one of your parents was in an accident and you want to visit them.  It's also a good litmus test for where you want to work as well: if whoever it is does not accept that as a reason for you to move heaven and earth, then they're a cunt and you should not work for them."
Diwali is one of the nights when the usual 11PM curfew is extended.
"Apparently it's a real thing:


And getting a lungful at the beach will help you to sleep better. This is because sea air is full of negative hydrogen ions, charged particles abundant in seaspray and concentrated in fresh air, which improve our ability to absorb oxygen by neutralising damaging free radicals (positive ions).

"The thing is, I can understand a lot of millennials feeling entitled. We were all told if we went to university, put our heads down, got good grades and lived for the future, then we'd get great jobs and be better off than our parents were.

So we went to uni, got our degrees, came out flapping our paper and saying 'awesome! So, where are all these cool jobs we were promised?'

Then suddenly, we're told we need to start at the bottom, make barely more than minimum wage, and we'll have to work our way up in our careers. So we get a graduate job, put in the hours and the free overtime to stand out from the 20 other graduates on the same scheme, and then we get a 1% raise year on year (if we're lucky).

Meanwhile the bosses kid is forced to be hired on to do the same job, but as a sub contractor or consultant or some shit and they can half arse the job and get twice the pay, meanwhile our team has no budget left to pick up the slack so now everyone is working overtime and hard working graduate isn't standing out anymore, they're doing the bare minimum that's expected.

So despite the things we were promised, we're realising that nothing has changed. The older generations are making all of the decisions that are making baby boomers lives easier and our lives harder. And there's a feeling that we have utterly no control over our own lives and destinies.

So we say fuck it, and with our low wages we go out and spend it all to try and get these nice things we were promised, because we've worked hard and maybe we feel like we do deserve something nice, and maybe we'll throw all of our money away on rent because we don't want to be living in mum and dad's basement anymore, because we want our freedom and independence that we learned was so important when we were away at university, and the parents got rid of all of our shit anyway and made our room into an office so fuck sleeping on the pull out sofa for the next 3 years whilst we save up for a mortgage.

So we move out, fill the rented flats with stuff we can't afford and go into thousands in debt, and the money you thought you would be able to save for a mortgage is all going on the sofa payments, but you don't care because savings are useless, we learned that when we first started learning about money and figured out that if you stuff all of your money into a bank to mature, the banks will use it and invest it poorly and lose it for you.

So maybe it isn't really entitlement that we're all feeling. Maybe it's resentment that everything we were promised never came true, and none of it was our fault, and somehow we're the ones paying for the sins and the lack of foresight of the baby boomers. And when we keep thinking that older generation will start dying off, they just keep on living longer and telling us that we need to pick up the slack because they worked hard in their day and they deserve to be taken care of now, the only thing being when they were younger they weren't paying for people living into their 80s and 90s.

But you can't harbour any resentment to the older generation, it's not their fault for living. But you have all of this anger and all of this frustration that you don't understand who to direct at. So you blame the elderly, or the immigrants, or the European Laws, or whichever tthing the tabloid headline directs your hate at. Is the government to blame? The bankers? If so, why are none of them getting punished?

So we retreat into TV, or playstation, or candy crush, or Twitter, or Facebook, so that we can get away from all of the crushing injustice that we feel constantly, and when those meaningless things don't live up to expectations the anger spills over. But it's not them we're angry at, not really. We don't hate Justin Bieber, or the Kardashians, or whichever celebrity gets caught cheating on their spouse, they're just reminders of a life we know we can never earn, no matter how hard we try.

So next time that a millennial complains that the new Star Wars movie is shit, or complains that their pumpkin spiced latte isn't tasty ebough, or that the Mac book or iPhone that we bought but can't afford is running a little slow, don't think we're complaining because we think we deserve perfection, realise that we're complaining because this is the best we can possibly hope for, and maybe we feel like the one thing that we've had to look forward to throughout all of the horrible realities of our situation should, at the very least, be just what we had been promised it would be for so long."

You do a little - so for that reason, you shouldn't send it in its current form.

When writing a complaint (any complaint), include:

- What the problem was, with details (you did that,  but as you know yourself, you need to tone it down, remove the emotion, and stick to facts).

- What you'd like them to do about it.

- The deadline by which you'd like them to do it.

- What your next step will be if they don't resolve it to your satisfaction.

In this case, you might give them a deadline to state, in writing, that they screwed up and won't do it again. And you might state that if they don't do that, or if they do something similar again, you will change the locks, which you understand is not allowed in your contract but it's the only means you have of enforcing your legal and contractual rights (and naturally you will restore the original lock, or give them copies of the new key, when you leave at the end of your tenancy).

As someone else said, get professional advice too (IANAL). I've never used Shelter but everyone says good things about them."

Sometimes I feel like I have little direction in life and don't really know what I'm doing. Then I go on Reddit and realise some people can hardly even people 
"I can't comment on the immigration laws I'm afraid. But as others have said, check out /r/iwantout.

Reading your post, though, I'm worried for you. I'm worried because you have your heart set on something so specific it's almost impossible to achieve.

And I'm not talking about coming to the UK.

I'm talking about the fact that you can only image one particular employer you'd want to work for. And it's not a particularly big employer. That is not normal, and not healthy, and is likely to lead to heartache. Even if, by some miracle, they did hire you - what are you going to do for the rest of your working life? It's unusual for people to stay in one job forever.

Now, lets add to that the fact that you want to settle in the UK, but you've never been here before. You don't even have a passport. It would be more normal to want to visit first and see if you like it! Why do you want to be here? What will you get here that you can't get at home?

It sounds to me like your early life hasn't gone as you planned. So, subconsciously, you've set yourself an impossible dream. And all the while that dream doesn't come true, you can use it as a scapegoat for why your life isn't great.

I think you need help, OP. But not with coming to the UK. You need help finding what it is you really need from life. Good luck."
"No.

Again, it boils down to primary trade. The Vine's primary trade is alcohol. They also happen to serve food, but that is secondary to their primary trade of **BEING A FUCKING PUB!**"

"As it doesn't sound like you've done any research (you certainly haven't mentioned what you've already discovered) I therefore suggest Luton, Slough and Bradford.  Perhaps three days in each, four in Slough."
"Obviously pro Hillary, I honestly don't know who I would vote for which I think helps me look at it as unbiased as possible.  

But Trumps scandals have all made the news or been plastered over Sky or Guardian,  where as I've only seen a few stories about Hillary from British media "
"I had a similar thing happen and I was only there for a month, and it's with all sorts of things. It happens online a lot too. People think you're being horrible if you make a joke that nobody would dream of as being mean spirited here. For example I once called someone insane because they were having just a plate of scrambled eggs on their own, and she said I really hurt her feelings and she didn't know why I was angry at her. Another is when I made a very casual joke at the expense of my own looks after catching sight of myself in a mirror, and my mate told me ""not to be that guy"", and he clarified that he meant the guy who hates himself and annoys everyone by saying awkward things. Just a cultural difference but it can get frustrating."
"Hopefully if I give them my card details they'll probably be able to find exactly when I subsequently withdrew some money from the same machine, so presumably they'd be able to determine exactly who used it immediately prior to me. 

It would fucking suck to lose £60.

Edit - but it's nice to be given gold. Cheers, whoever you are."
