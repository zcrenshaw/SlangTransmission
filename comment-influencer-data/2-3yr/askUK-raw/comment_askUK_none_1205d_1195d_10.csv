Yeah but you'll look a right tool.
"I'm Scottish. 

Please double check that you are supposed to be wearing a kilt. 

Men wear kilts, not women (school uniforms excluded). 

"
"Don't sign anything at all. Go in tomorrow and state that you will not be signing anything till you've spoken to a solicitor about this issue. Work cannot make you sign anything.

  If they threaten with suspension or firing you then that's illegal. 

Go to a solicitor explain your situation and they can tell you what your rights are and how to move forward and of they try anything dodgy then you can progress to filing a suit against them. 

Please please do not sign anything. "
"I know it's become a trope, but I'd stay for the free healthcare and lack of guns. "
It's not.
"&gt; I'm going to Scotland tomorrow for a wedding and we were told to wear kilts.

Are you sure that message was extended to the women too? Usually kilts are a thing men wear at weddings, not women."
Depends if you already have any beef with your insurance company 
"For chavs and twats yeah. For normal people who don't want to look a twat, no."
"Go paperless then get a template for the statements and send them to yourself every month with strange amounts coming in from people traffikers and going out to Mexican cartels

EDIT: Thanks for the gold, put it on the statement as ""bought Gold for a stranger, pissed off the Cartels"""
"Do not listen to that other guy, he clearly does not know Scotland very well.

What happens is, everybody lines up in a line and one by one the Royal Scots Dragoon checks each person. You raise your kilt in front of EVERYONE and get a full and detailed inspection. If a person wears any kind of undergarment, you are immediately ejected from Scotland with a thistle shoved up your arse and forbidden to return. Otherwise, and you are correctly naked underneath, you are paraded thrice around the courtyard whilst you raise your kilt up fully to show everyone that you have obeyed ancient Scottish culture to the letter and that you are not a dreadful person. This happens to everyone. You will be grilled, and if you have underwear you are a disgraceful person in Scotland. They told you to wear a kilt therefore you must follow all conventional wisdom and wear no underwear. 

Not regimental wool socks? Oh *please*. Are you even trying? Everyone compares socks on arrival, it is the Scottish tradition. No regimental wool socks, no entry. What kind of English peasant are you??

No sporran??? Are you even trying at all? Everyone is there wearing their finest sporran and you don't have one at all? Do you realize quite how ridiculous you will look?

Skean dugh... well if you don't have one of these how will you keep the English at bay?

So they never specified full costume? Well of course not, that doesn't need to be said, get yourself a shield and some bagpipes as well. I also advise you paint your face half blue, bring a bag of haggis, watch Braveheart 17 times and learn how to deep fry a mars bar.

Trust me, I'm American."
"Last time I needed to go to the GP, I phoned up:

&gt; ""My mouth really hurts. It's killing me. Can I come in?""
&gt; 
&gt; ""I'm afraid we're a bit full up today. Can you come in half an hour?""
&gt; 
&gt; ""Yes.""
&gt; 
&gt; ""Okay, see you then.""

At the doctors:

&gt; GP: ""Hmm... it appears you have [illness].""

&gt; Me: ""What can you do?""

&gt; GP: ""Go the pharmacy across the road and buy the drugs I will now write on this piece of paper.""

&gt; Me: ""Okay. Bye.""

One hour and about thirty quid later, I'm back at home, medicating.

I'm supposed to want to get rid of this?"
Guns and medical bills
"It happens in the UK, but not common at all. It gives the impression of being lazy - which people can frown at.

But no, not uncommon, but not exactly widely accepted either."
Women were definitely told to wear kilts? The weddings I've been to for the Scottish side of my family have never involved a woman wearing a kilt and I've never heard of it in the media. 
"Voting days really don't have any impact on anything, other than you'll see ""Polling Station -&gt;"" signs everywhere.   Shops won't close.  Public transport won't be full of people desperately trying to make their vote (most people's Polling Stations will be in walking distance of their homes, anyway.)  The polling stations are open from 7am till 10pm, so you might see a little chaos (i.e. twenty or so panicked people queuing outside at 9.50pm) later on, but it won't make the country grind to a halt. 


We reserve that for when we get a few flakes of snow.  "
"I know right, just chainmail? No sword belt, jerkin and helmet? Amateur."
"You're... you're not invading, are you? Because if you are you can jolly well stop it. "

So at the time of posting, as far as I can tell:

A quick search on GMC suggests that three of the four listed doctors on this page: http://www.theonlineclinic.co.uk/online-clinic.asp are registered with the GMC and on the GP Register.  At the time I searched, the remaining doctor was registered with the GMC but not on the GP Register.  When I searched, all were listed as having licenses to practise.  This doesn't necessarily mean these are the people who will consult with you, they could have been fraudulently listed, with or without their knowledge.

They appear to be correctly registered with the ICO: https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/Z2333188

The MHRA Online medicines seller registry approves their website: http://medicine-seller-register.mhra.gov.uk/search-registry/102

&gt;ONLINE CLINIC (UK) LIMITED is registered to sell medicines from the following websites:
www.theonlineclinic.co.uk and www.privatedoctordirect.com

Prescription only medicines
General sales list medicines
Pharmacy medicines
	
Their domain name WHOIS registration information matches their Companies House information.  The original registration date (2004) is consistent with information on their website, and Companies House registration date.

Tl;dr: Looks good from my perspective. You need to draw your own conclusions. 

**EDIT**: If you saw the big green buttons on the website, where with one click you can immediately see the registration information for this company/website without having to manually search; you might like to know this has been introduced EU wide thanks to an excellent European directive:  Directive 2011/62/EU (s25.)

"Insurance is good until it isn't. 

In some cases a doctor can come into your room after major surgery, check up on you, and then leave. Guess what unknown to you your insurance doesn't cover his visit. Normally you can contest the charge though. It'll take sometime to win however.

Some operations and procedures aren't covered by insurance or they are but the hospital isn't. So what you think is $100 ends up being $700 because of the location. Because of the Affordable Care Act things have gotten much better. However expect $35 doctor visits, $100 urgent care visits, and $250 emergency room visits. Need an ambulance ride? From my experience that'll cost ya $1,500. Now calling 911 is free but it's the transit that costs money. You can drive yourself but lets be honest if you're hurt bad enough or unconscious you'll need them to take you.

Best advice from someone who has been working in the US for his entire life is don't get sick and don't expect vacations. On the vacation front many employers see 2 weeks a year more than enough.

Oh and if cancer or accident prone get additional cancer insurance and accident insurance. Your health insurance has a cap in coverage. That cap normally is exceeded by costs from cancer care. If your work offers it also get short term and long term leave insurance. If you do get into trouble and run out of vacation short term leave will pay you typically 60% of your wages. Long term will too but it won't kick in for six weeks. All that runs me about $40 a month on top of my family insurance payment of $320. I opted out of the cancer insurance at an extra $40 a week. At the time I was under a surprise 10% company wide pay cut so I needed what I could get.

Oh and you can only change your benefits once a year unless a life changing event happens.

Final note check the state labor laws for the state you are moving to. My state, Oklahoma, has some real backwards labor laws about breaks. If it's in your contact however congratulations you can take a break without repercussions. Just be warned some establishments won't let you leave site and won't let you smoke on site. I don't smoke so this isn't an issue for me. However I've seen people almost get walked out for violating a smoking ban."
"Maybe not get rid, but I think your doctor needs to be more specific with his diagnoses."
"It's technically illegal to stay up at night and sleep during the day?

I think you've worked yourself up into a bit of a state. Have a nice cup of tea and calm down."
Going around calling people above you liars is absolutely *terrible* advice.
"That's bullshit and you should call your HR lead a liar. It doesn't matter where the company is from, you - the employee - are a UK citizen (I think) and entitled to union representation."
"Yes. I'm in physics and writing a lot of numbers can get it mixed up with 2's or 1's, so I cross it to make it easy to tell."
"There has been a limited effort on this - among others, pointing out to older people that younger people are overwhelmingly in favour of keeping our rights to study &amp; work across the continent, and that even if you might want out, what would your grandkids want. But that's turned out to be less salient than the more immediate 'the effect next year'."
"I've always said if an employer offered me a year or two secondment to the US I would love the adventure, but if it was permanent I'd be quite uneasy. 

The main downsides would be - healthcare, likely far less holiday, less job security/workers rights. Plus, if you have a family there is less support on things like childcare, and funding 'college' would be quite scary. 

Overall, I would love an adventure to see a new country - but I'm not sure the US is somewhere I would move to with a view of it being permanent. "
"Five quid in a kebab shop could get you a massive kebab, all the salad, sauce, probably even a small chips. That wins for me, I wouldn't feed it to my kids though."
"Please make sure you *both* wear underwear!  Otherwise a rough wind at the wrong time could make the wedding very interesting!   

Be aware also that you will probably be the only woman there in a kilt - every other female will be in a flowery dress and possibly a hat/fascinator.  If you're unsure - check with the people who invited you.  "
"Not under a kilt, but otherwise it's OK."
"What an odd question 

Yes it's totally legal though, I've seen a bunch of people do it for comic con or living history things. Never seen anyone pop to the shops in it though, I imagine you'd look like a bit of a twat, you'd have massive Leg and core muscles supporting all that weight all day though "
Airline food always tastes really nice to me and it's actually something I looked forward to when I fly.
No it's weird and wrong.
"No, it's all in perfect working order."
I think he should milk it for all its worth.
"I moved in somewhere in November and got letters for about a month until I declared on their website I didn't watch live TV and got nothing since then. So I'd say it's worth doing yes, takes hardly anytime to do either. "
"Fairly sure that firing you would be unfair dismissal. It is perfectly fine to note to a couple if collages that someone is in a cubicle with the door unlocked with a laptop on their knees, looking sweaty and guilty, that is entirely unprofessional conduct. If you do get the boot, go the citizens advice and take them to the cleaners. God people in offices are weird. "
"I cancelled my TV licence over the phone.  Told them I don't have a TV or a working aerial (only have a disconnected cable line) and that I don't watch iPlayer.  They said this was fine, and that they understood.

A month or so later, we started getting letters that did their best to look like debt collection notices (red writing, ""this is what will happen when you go to court"", etc), but on closer inspection were just generic warnings about who needs a licence. So I spent another half an hour on the phone, and the guy said he understood and that we wouldn't get letters anymore.

Then a month later, a guy who was doing his best to dress like he was in the police came to the door, and asked to inspect our flat.  I reluctantly allowed him, and since this is a pretty small place he could see we had no TVs.  He said this would be the end of it.

That was 3 years ago.  We've been getting deceptive letters and visits from TV Licence people regularly since then.  I tried phoning again about 2 years ago, spent another half hour waiting, and was told we would no longer be bothered.  They carried on.

I don't let them in anymore, and I no longer reply to the letters.  At this point, the more ink and man hours of theirs I can waste, the better, so if I thought I could stop them - which I can't - I wouldn't.

The money isn't so that you'll be allowed to watch TV, it's to stop the intimidation.  Fuck them, they're extortionists."
"Metres, usually."
"What about these ""cash cows"" I've been hearing so much about?"
"Kettle?

Please don't sign anything else. Forcing you to sign is illegal and you signing anything you don't agree with even if it says different is admitting what's been written and can be used against you. 
"&gt;It gives the impression of being lazy  
  
I prefer ""slovenly""."
"Yep. 

7's and Z's get a cross, 0's occasionally a diagonal slash depending on circumstance."
"Even if you are meant to wear a kilt - which I very much doubt, it's traditionally make only - nobody is going to check if you have underwear on or not! 

I love threads like this, it makes me visualize crazy things like a guy inspecting under everyone's kilt at the entrance to a wedding. "
"The only place I can really think of it being commonly used is Hamish and Dougal from *I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue*, as portrayed by Barry Cryer and Graeme Garden."
