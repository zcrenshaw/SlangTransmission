This could be hate crime.

"Mona the Vampire! I think it was on CBBC so can't have been that obscure but no one talks about it anymore. 

Also that programme where a guy dressed as a Raven would send children on challenges and then make them disappear if they lost. Was always so confused about where the children went haha. "

I always say the thirteenth of June. Every day. Regardless of the actual date. 
Theresa May.... in a field of wheat....
Oh bugger.
"Report to both the Police and Royal Mail asap. It is not a common prank and not anything someone should just accept. 

If who ever sent this  doesn't get what ever reaction that they want they could easily escalate to something much worse. I would also be very careful opening any unexpected packages received from now on as a precaution."
What a coincidence that somebody with that username should have this happen to them!
Sounds like you've encountered the resident gym-wanker... There's one in every gym. Ignore...
Yes. Smaller gardens mean more houses which means more money for developers
A shitpost?
"Technically we are never without a PM, parliament may dissolve before a General Election but the PM remains.

A new government is formed after the Queen invites the leader of the winning party to form a Government. Once that leader accepts the offer to form a Government, they become the new PM. This was done on The 9th of June, the day after the election (Friday).

Theresa May is Prime Minister.


EDIT: Wording"
"&gt;Why are people from Grenfell Tower so adamant about being resettled in the same borough?

cos they fucking live there. friends, schools, jobs, you know, their lives."
"I had a similar situation when I last rented. I contested it, saying that wear and tear was expected after inhabiting the place for two years. No further contest and I got it all back. It's also worth noting that if your deposit was not held in a secure scheme you're entitled to three times the amount back, so that's well worth checking."
"The 13th of June. Blimey, we are not Americans."
"Did this absent-mindedly as a kid while I was reading a book one Christmas. Chased it up with some lime sherbet. Later vomited the most delicious syrupy acid-green mess you've ever seen. Spent the next 48 hours in some sort of sugar haze where I thought the Day of the Triffids had really happened.

Good year. "

"May can attempt to pass a 'Queens speech' (ie: a legislative programme for the coming year) even if the conservatives don't hold a majority. If this passes then she continues as PM leading a minority government. If it is defeated then (*iirc*) the Tories have about a week to sort themselves out before trying again, most likely with a new leader. If that second attempt fails then Corbyn gets a go at passing his own Queens speech. If it passes he becomes PM, if it fails we're back to another election.

I think this is correct but take it with a pinch of salt for now as it's very late. Hopefully someone will have corrected any mistakes by morning, but this is my understanding of the process. "
"No it's a weird thing that people on /r/britishproblems perpetuate, social anxiety is not Britishness. 

That's only in London where you don't talk to strangers on the tube. Up north I'd be happy to talk to people on the bus, say cheers to the bus driver e.t.c.

Also, see us when we're drunk. Completely the opposite of that bullshit introverted stereotype. "
They're ordering an International sporting event that happens every 4 years.
They sell enough food to cover the costs of everything and have profit left over.
As long as they're an Anglican gay atheist and not a Catholic gay atheist it's fine.
"I manage a pub, and chefs are currently the bane of my life...

Why the fuck are you paying for ingredients out of your own pocket?

From what you've described, a wage increase isn't what you need, its a new job.  Sorry to be blunt, but I've seen this numerous times before, it won't end well for you.  You can either stay put, get stressed, burn out and be done with the industry, or you can find somewhere who will teach / train you etc...

I mean, hell, theres a nationwide shortage of chefs out there, the ball is in your court..."
"This is the correct answer. 

If you come to my place I have hardwood floors so I don't care.  My mother has carpet everywhere, including the sodding bathroom, and she does."

"That subreddit, whilst built on partial truths is a complete exaggeration for humour/karma.

No, people don't sell all their belongings and move to Antarctica because they once accidentally said hello to the postman. "
People who eat that probably never eat fruit at all.
"You are entitled to a copy of your medical records which you could take to any other dentist in the UK to ask for verification. If it turned out you had unnecessary work done, that dentist could very well lose his license. If you think your dentist is telling you that you need work done unnecessarily, request your medical records and transfer to a new practice."
"The etiquette is: ask. 

Often people have different areas of their house that they have their shoes on or off e.g. Upstairs and downstairs "
"Manchester! I pay £420 PCM for a 3 bed semi. 

edit: Some points Iv made in the comments; 

• It's not a shitty area. 
• I'm in a quite road, mainly elderly people. 
• Not had a single problem in the 3 years Iv lived here. 
• My car insurance actually dropped £100 when I moved to this address. 
• We have a village with a post office, bakery, butchers etc. 
• ITS NOT A SHITTY AREA. 

I pay £105 a week and it's a 1960 built 3 bed semi, with a drive, front garden and large back garden. "

"Meaty, pretty much like every other dog."
"I think he has the same sort of upper-class/upper-middle class armour as Boris Johnson.  Involved in enough scandals to end the career of most people twice over, but comes out of it more popular often.

The one thing I wouldn't damn him for is Saville.  I don't think Morgan had anything to do with the BBC in the 70s and 80s.  Also, it appears half the entertainment industry ""knew"" about Savile, but either couldn't be arsed to do anything, didn't have the evidence or were ignored or hushed up."

"In all seriousness you *could* invalidate your friend's citizenship if it can be shown he did not take the oath seriously.

If your friend acquired citizenship through the naturalisation process this is no laughing matter; citizenship is difficult, expensive, and takes a *long* time to acquire.

"Ooh I can actually answer this. 

One of the reasons is that the TOCs are the ones telling you the reasons behind a delay, and are perfectly at liberty to lie to you so you don't hate them as much... 
Signalling problems sounds much better than ""one of our drivers is stuck in traffic"" which happens more than you might think. 

The other thing is that signalling problems encompasses literally everything that isn't easy to explain. It's basically short hand for ""infrastructure issues"". 

The infrastructure is old, crowded, under-maintained, undermanned and over used. It's impacted by any number of issues (flooding, leaves, the cold, the heat, stray plastic bags, fucking trespassers, animals etc)

The last reason is communication. The lines are so strung out nowadays that while the signaller is actually dealing with an issue that he himself isn't 100% sure of the cause, there are delays in communicating this up the chain, so, like Chinese whispers, it might end up as ""signalling problems"" more often than not. 

TL;DR: it's all very complicated. Everything breaks, people are terrible, please forgive us. "

"One that comes to mind is Zzzap! It was like a freaky comic book coming to life through various sketches/characters. 

I hated it so much. Everything about it made me uneasy even as a kid, but it definitely stuck with me! "
"Yes, but reality is you will need to sue them to get it. 

Send their head office a 'Letter Before Action' to pay up within 10 days or you'll start a small claims in the county court. 

Or if you paid by credit/debit card speak to your bank. "
"Met up with a guy a few years ago; I agreed to get a train to his arse-end town, takes at least an hour because there were some changes and whatever. We'd been talking/texting for a while, but nothing remotely serious.

Went to his house and was greeted by his parents, who were there and asking lots of questions, including wanting to know my full name so they could look me up on facebook. They were very protective and much much older than him - maybe 50 years his senior.

Went for 'walk' - 4 miles later in the heat, and as a large man (oh yeah, this is a gay story), I'm dripping in sweat; I barely look passable on the best of days, let alone when it's 30c and there is no shade, or water, or air. I was very much out of my comfort zone, but I was essentially stranded so had no choice but to go along with it.

Return back to his house, watch a film and make out a little as we're lay on his bed. He wants to do more, but I'm still still recovering from the heat and unable to freshen myself up without having to interact with his parents, so I'm reluctant. He is a.. *firm* kisser, not awful, but notably firm. It was almost *exactly* like open mouth kissing a snapping turtle.

He suddenly loses interest in making out, despite his obvious erection so I'm like... *alright*? Note that I wasn't expecting any of this to happen anyway, so I'm not bothered, just confused. We go back to watching this awful, awful film and I ask to genuinely try and make sure he's okay, but instead he just kind of mumbles and makes nonsensical, passive excuses.

After an hour, as he's now basically just sat playing on his phone, I make excuses and leave, after saying goodbye to his parents (obviously). He seemed disappointed I was leaving, but mentioned his parents don't like people being at the house after dark anyway. Right. I mean, by this point, it couldn't get much more surreal, so I've sort of become numb to the insanity and stopped asking questions.

I get a text whilst I'm on the train home, a long text, breaking up with me. At least three paragraphs. We were never in a relationship. This was the first time we'd ever met. Turns out after some confused back-and-forth that his ex-boyfriend helped him write the breakup text message. I have never laughed so hard. I'm laughing just typing this out while I'm in work. The whole thing was just mental. I wouldn't change what I experienced that day *for the world*. 

We still talk very occasionally to this day. He's a nice lad, just... I don't even know what.

Fucking Wigan, man. Full of bumpkins."
"What I did: worked a job that was ok with a good pay, lived and ate cheap. Saved the majority of my money. Did this for two years or so then quit and travelled and enjoyed life. Repeat. Maybe not so sustainable in the long run, but thats a problem for later. "
