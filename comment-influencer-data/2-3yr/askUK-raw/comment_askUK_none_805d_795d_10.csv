Getting shot
Expensive text books. Every askreddit thread ever.
It's an hour before Dave Ja Vu 
Then going to hospital and having to pay $7 trillion for treatment and the ambulance.
"Just to be clear OP, read ""I'm sorry for your loss"" and move on. Not ""I'm sorry for your loss and move on."" That might be construed as rude. Lol."
"Shitting themselves.

Seems to happen after they eat 10lbs of mexican food or something. "
Yep. Just go into a police station and ask nicely. In Arabic. Whilst holding a large knife.

"Give me £100 and you will learn not to trust strangers.

(But seriously, buy yourself a small Pi-like device and learn to do something with it?)"
"Prince Edmund (1461-1498) is the first man in the dynasty to refer to himself as 'the Black Adder'. He first appeared after The War of the Roses. Henry Tudor didn't like him so tried to rid the history books of him. 

He accidentally became Prince during The War of the Roses when he killed the king during battle. He was once due to be married to a very ugly Spanish Princess so he did everything possible to get out of it. He was often thought to be a user of dark magic and was outed during a witch hunt. When all of Edmund's titles were removed except Warden of the Royal Privies, Edmund was furious and decided to seize the throne with the help of the six most evil men in the kingdom. "
Check Mr Fancypants drinking Bombay sapphire. Why don't you drink Tesco value gin like the rest of us.
"I know the healthcare thing has been done to death, but I'm still gobsmacked that not only do they have to pay for ambulance rides, ambulance rides can cost thousands and thousands of dollars."
"I didn't think Sainsbury's would stock Tesco Value gun, fair play to them"
Chocolate that doesn't taste of arse?
And then getting sued by the person that shot you.
Thanks. That's great. Kinda ruined my dreams but that isn't your fault.
"Compare it to all-gender toilets in new buildings. Makes no difference to me or my life, but it makes a massive difference to some other people, so why not do it? Make their life a bit better with no detriment to mine.  Is that not the definition of being human and having empathy?"
"&gt; We're specifically going to be taking a train from Heathrow to Bath, around midday.

Buying train tickets is enough to drive anyone to neurosis.

Flexible tickets are available, but they cost more.

I don't know about services from Heathrow, but train services from some other airports allow up to 3 hours flexibility in the ticket as standard if your flight is delayed. Check the Terms &amp; Conditions page of the website of the particular train company you'll be using.

But bear in mind that each train company has slightly different rules. If you're changing trains to a different operator, the operator for the next stage of the journey might not be so flexible.

&gt; Aside from my US driver's license and passport, is there anything else I should absolutely have? Insurance information, for example?

Check and double check how large a deposit you will need for your car. I once get a shock when they demanded a £1,000 deposit because I was using a foreign driving licence.

The insurance that comes with the car has enormous excesses, and often doesn't cover basic things like windscreen damage. They will try to upsell you on better insurance. Don't buy it. Plan ahead, and you can get the same insurance upgrade (called ""excess insurance"") for a fraction of the price through independent insurers online.

If you hit something, exchange insurance and contact details or notify the police. ""Something"" includes dogs, but not cats.

&gt; what're some vital rules or guidelines I should know about driving there?

By and large, traffic rules are enforced and obeyed. Obey the speed limits (unless you really know what you're doing) and always signal. If the speed limit is non-standard, there are frequent sign-posts *except* when you enter a 20 mph zone. Standard speed limits for a car are:

 - Built up areas with street lighting: 30 mph
 - Away from built up areas: 60 mph
 - Roads with ~~an overtaking lane~~ **EDIT** *a central reservation*: 70 mph

Don't cross an unbroken white line across the middle of the road. (Not strictly enforced, but the lines are there for a reason.) If there are two lines on the middle of the road, where one is dashed and the other is unbroken, obey the line on your side.

If there is a yellow line painted at the curbside, check for signs giving details about when you can park. If there are two yellow lines, don't park. You can also get a parking ticket for parking like an asshole near corners and so on.

After a recent Supreme Court ruling, car parks at places like supermarkets and service stations can charge penalty charges (typically £50--100) if you overstay your welcome. Watch out for the signs.

Make sure you know how to use a roundabout. Roundabouts are designed to be as free-flowing as possible. Yield to vehicles coming onto the roundabout from your right, unless you can see that they are going to be prevented from entering the roundabout because they have to yield to someone else.

&gt; Any common mistakes you often notice tourists/foreigners make I should be sure not to make?

Don't arm yourself. No electric stun guns. No mace spray. Not even a *kubotan*. (A multi-tool with a non-locking 3"" blade is acceptable.)

We've all seen *Friends* so we know what to expect from you guys. Drinking in the UK is more of a social activity. Making ""friends"" with a barman who pours you shots isn't a thing. If you're in a pub, most problems can be solved with the magic words, ""Is it my round, then?""

If you hear one guy in a pub or restaurant talking in a booming voice that can be clearly heard above the background chatter -- mostly about himself -- that voice usually has a US accent. Just so you know.

&gt; Can we expect to make use of any ride share services (Uber, something else?) in the situations we'd rather not drive on our own on occasion?

Uber has rolled out across much of the UK. Check for local availability.

&gt; Is there a certain carrier we should look for, specifically knowing we wont be in a major city most of the time?

Don't forget that it's called a ""mobile phone"", or just ""mobile"", in British English.

There are four major networks and all offer good coverage. The UK is densely populated so, even when you're driving through the country, coverage is usually adequate. If you're staying in one location in the country, you may find yourself in a deadspot, so check in advance if you know where you're going to be staying. Either ask the people who are there, or check on the service providers' coverage maps. (Bear in mind that dead spots on the map may be a couple of hundred yards from dead spots on the ground.)

While there are four networks, there are many more Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) that buy capacity on these networks. You can get a very reasonably priced pre-paid contract if you shop around: much cheaper than buying through Verizon. If you have a contact in the UK, ask them to order a SIM for you and then mail it to you. The SIM is usually free. Failing that, you can buy a SIM at the airport (expensive), at a supermarket, at a dollar store and so on. But you should still check on-line first to see who offers the best deals.

If you're planning on tethering another device to your phone, check terms and conditions carefully. I once bought an ""unlimited"" one month data package and tethered to my phone for frequent video conferencing. But I didn't notice that the tethering was only for the first 6 GB.

&gt; Can we plan to use (and plan to rely on) Google Maps to help us get from place to place?

Yes, Google Maps works well. If you tell Google Maps the journey you are making it will cache the data to get you through any dead spots.

&gt; What're the vital emergency numbers to be aware of?

There is one emergency service number and two non-emergency numbers:

Number | Service
---------|--------
999 (or 112) | Police emergency, ambulance, fire, mountain rescue, coastguard
101 | Police non-emergency
111 | Medical advice

&gt; What customs or etiquette when it comes to dining and paying (tipping, specifically) should we be aware of?

No need to tip in a cheap diner. In more formal restaurants, tip about 10%, unless the menu says ""service charge included""."
"I see so many comments, especially, on r/confession and /r/AskWomen, where therapy is advised.  Surely the solution to all  problems is binge drinking?"
I don't think anyone here has any strong feelings towards him either way.
"Having to ""line up"" at the DMV to do... something... with driving licences regularly.

As opposed to filling in a form and posting it off once a decade."
"Tell your landlord you lost your job and can't afford the rent, and you'd like to surrender the contract (a months notice should be fair). You are moving home.

Any sane landlord will let you out rather than chase you in court for money that could never appear."
Yeah this is one that's always baffled me. I always think how *bland* must be the food you eat normally if something a little spicy will completely mess up your system??
"According to Reddit they're all depressed, suffer from anxiety, need to see therapists, bipolar and have ADHD "
"It's a TV channel that constantly repeats old Mock the Week, Top Gear and 8 out of 10 Cats episodes."
Worth pointing out that the father of the kid(who was there with her) recently published a book relating to jobsworth and it just so happens he gets in the national news a few weeks later...
"Not something they complain about but they seem to change their car oil all the time - even to the extent that there are specialised shops everywhere for the purpose. Now, I suspect the average American does many more miles than me (and in some areas at hotter temperatures) but even so, it seems to be a massively ingrained part of their psyche that a full oil change is something that needs to happen with incredible frequency."
"The people of Hartlepool once mistook a monkey for a Frenchman, their suspicions apparently being confirmed by it's  inability to speak English, the unfortunate creature was subsequently executed for treason."
Then being shot by the police 
"You often walk past the person's spouse/partner, in which case you just say ""I'm sorry for your loss and move on."
Literally thought this was a sarcastic post about affordable homes for a second!
"Best time of my life, much more relaxed than 'proper' school, lots of parties and hanging out with your mates."
"First off, it should be noted that people in the UK don't hate France or the French. We consider France and the French to be close friends.

That being said, there is a long history of jokes about hating the French. It probably stems from France being the closest foreign country. In the UK (I guess its the same everywhere) we love to bash and joke about those closes to us. Towns joke about the next town over, cities biggest rivals are the next closest city, and sports teams mock their local rivals. France is just the closest country, so gets the most jokes.

We could joke about the Irish, and often do, but due to our history it would probably be taken badly if we regularly said the things about them that we do about the French.

We love you, and have no other near by countries, so it's you we mock."
There's loads of stuff but I can't think of many just now. One I do find ridiculous is having coworkers complain when people take holidays. 
"I remember my first year Uni books cost £250 new.

Loads of folk bought them.

I went to the library. "
"Not really a complaint but the 'perks' of military service. Seems every company in the states offers freebies to veterans, funny considering they are often mistreated after they leave."
"Even the Woolworths in my high street is still empty, it closed 8 years ago! "
"And they will take you in an ambulance even if you explicitly refuse. They will physically prevent you from leaving. Then charge you later. Think of the start of Breaking Bad.

Anywhere else that's called kidnapping."
"make sure you've contacted tutor, course leader, dean etc, put on the pressure. 

if you've got the deadline you followed in writing, maybe (if you aren't getting anywhere and need a threat) even suggest the uni is on the hook for all the incurred costs you'd be out of pocket for. you could probably sue in small claims for all the costs mentioned."
"We have idiots in this country.

If enough idiots buy the sun, or other papers who act without integrity, then these papers remain viable.

The press are forced to apologise and sometimes pay fines when they print an error ( lie), but only when someone calls them on it, which is infrequent.

Tabloids across the world aim sensationalist crap at the lowest common denominator.  "
"As long as it hasn't been contaminated with things like breadcrumbs or butter, it'll almost certainly be safe to consume. To be sure, give it a quick visual inspection, and check to see how it smells and tastes. If it looks, smells, and tastes like death, it means it's fine. "
"Bearing in mind that on r/food, butter chicken and chicken korma are held up as the pinnacle of Indian cuisine, this is hardly surprising. "
Literally couldn't care less.  How do you feel about William Pitt or Lord Frederick North?
"o7 thank you for your service o7

Oh what? You want mental healthcare? Benefits and welfare? Fuck off, GI Joe."
"Happened to me once, at uni (which was about 25 years ago)

Proper crusty type gave me a mouthful about how she was perfectly capable of opening a door herself and didn't need a man to do it for her.

So I said ""fine"", pushed her back through it and slammed the door shut.

I realise with hindsight I shouldn't have pushed her - for what it's worth, it was more an ""ushering"" push than an actual shove, but I was probably lucky not to get trouble over that...

Look on her face was priceless though :-)"
"Blocking the toilet and needing a plunger. Funnily enough I have once blocked a toilet on holiday in America. Their plumbing is really bad, and the stupid flush style of the toilets is terrible."
"I try and keep this word in reserve, but the people you work for sound like total cunts.

Don't beat yourself up.  You took a bad job out of uni, I did it too.

Follow the advice about giving your flat back, then hand your notice in.  Check your contract, you may be able to leave with as little as a week's notice."

Such a positive way to react to a broken dream 
"Of course not. It's extremely expensive to keep someone in prison, they're not going to do it for the fun."
"Just be calm and polite, say something like you like the flat, but won't afford it, and **hate the thought of being in arrears and owing money you will struggle to pay back**, really stress that you'll have no job/money. And you don't want to do that to them. You think its fairer to surrender. Most LL would jump at that."
"There's definitly stuff my parents couldnt afford for me when I was a kid, i'm sure he'll get over it."
Pineapples are banned in the United Kingdom. By law any possession of pineapples can be punishable by death. 
No one cares about him here. He is just the first US president to us; you'd be surprised how little we actually care about losing the US as a colony here. 
Police brutality.
"For fun? No

As part of a well-planned BBC or Channel 4 documentary, maybe."
The effects of alcohol on an IT worker.
"Bumbling moron is perfectly fine for a funeral really.  

 Turn up wearing appropriate clothes (e.g. black suit for men), go where directed, when you are directed to. Look suitably sad.  There's very little you need to do regardless of whether you are in a church, crem, etc.

You may want to order flowers in advance if requested, don't give them on the day.  They're very inconvenient."
/r/food is an appalling sub. On any given day there's usually about 6 different cheeseburgers on the front page. Then there's probably a few steaks and yet another fucking board of random food everyone seems to have a hard on for now. 
"&gt; I know nothing about cars...

Then please don't spend £30k on one as you'll just lose masses of it on making a bad choice / newbie mistakes / depreciation.

£10k will get you a great reliable used car, keep the £20k in the bank :)

**Edit:** Here you go... https://goo.gl/kR4nzg ... and put the £19k saved towards an early retirement :)"
"It's always fun to read their justification of their privatised health service though. There's a really prevalent bit of ideology I've seen from a few people who honesty believe that socialised healthcare only works in the rest of the world because the US military protects us, so we don't need to fund our own.

"no.

"Also, if you've never driven with a manual (stick) transmission, specify that you need an automatic. Manual transmissions are far more prevailant over here and the car hire place will give you a manual by default unless you specifically ask for an automatic."
