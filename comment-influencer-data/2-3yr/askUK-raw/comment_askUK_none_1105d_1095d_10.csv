"A place where Strongbow is viewed as a premium product...wow.

For OP: Imagine whatever beer in the USA is just the most average, boring, not cheap enough to be considered dirty, not strong enough for the alcoholics, not really tasting of much, middle of the road product.  That's Strongbow.  It's the Fosters or Carling of cider.

Edit:  Some Googling revealed Strongbow, Bulmer's and Magner's aren't considered real ciders, as most of the alcohol doesn't come from fermented apples, but corn (and sugar and stuff is added).  Nice."

I did a google to check what G force wasps can sustain, but there's no info easily available.  Maybe I'm the first person to ever google ""How much g force can wasps sustain?""

Perhaps I should email the natural history museum to ask them...

EDIT: I have emailed a [Dr Broad](http://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/departments-and-staff/staff-directory/gavin-broad.html) at the natural history museum.

    ""Dear Dr Broad
    
    Sadly a member of the AskUK branch of reddit has a problem with a wasp infestation (see https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/530gr6/hey_guys_bit_of_an_emergency_situation_here_lots/).  A debate started about how best to resolve the problem given that pest control were prohibitively expensive for the poster in question.
    
    One example suggested simply using the hose on a hoover to suck them all up.  Obviously you'd disapprove of such an activity, but the question came up of how tolerant wasps would be to the G forces involved being swept around in one of Dyson's cylinders.  
    
    Put another way, I was wondering, are there any studies into how much G force such insects can tolerate?

    Thank you ever so much,

    Yours sincerely,

Firstly driving to and between standby points, secondly some (actually most) categories of 999 calls do not require an emergency response, thirdly once get to the patient if they require transport to hospital it is actually quite rare for this to be under emergency conditions - the vast majority of journeys into hospital are normal road speed."

"MY ~~VERY QUICK~~ SUPER LONG GUIDE TO PUB ETIQUETTE BASED ON MY MANY, MANY YEARS OF DEDICATED STUDY

On entering the pub it's normal to go straight to the bar. If the bar is not too busy find an empty space at the bar and wait. The person serving drinks will (should) serve everyone in the order that they approached the bar. Be patient and wait your turn, but don't be afraid to speak up if you think you've missed your turn. Don't be a dick and try to get served before people who have been there longer.

If the bar is busy, say at a weekend, you may find people are backed up two or three deep in front of the bar. Again, find a space and wait your turn, but it may take a lot longer than you're used to. Again, don't be pushy but make sure the bar staff have seen you. Making eye contact with the bar staff is a good idea as they'll take note of you and make sure you're served as promptly as possible.

When you're asked what you want specify your drink of choice and the serving measure. Common serving measures are as follows:

Beer/Cider:

1 Pint (19 Oz)

1/2 Pint (9 1/2 Oz)

Wine: (Pubs vary quite a bit on the size of their wine measures)

Small - 125 or 175ml (4-6 Oz) 

Large - 175 or 250ml (6-8 Oz)

Spirits (Liquor):

Single

Double

If you don't know what you want and the bar is fairly quiet don't be afraid to tell the bar staff what sort of drink you like and ask for a recommendation. Many pubs will even let you sample certain beers until you find one you like. Don't do this in a very busy bar though - make sure you know what you want before you order.

You will be asked for payment straight away. Tabs are usually an option, although usually they're only used if you're also getting food. The vast majority of people pay on a drink-by-drink basis. No need to tip the bar staff, although if you're feeling very generous you could say ""keep the change"" or ""have one on me"" (meaning ""take some money out of my change to buy yourself a drink""). It's pretty rare to do this, though.

When you've got your drink either find a seat at an empty table or at the bar. In a busy pub with limited seating, try to stand out of the way. If you're a sociable type don't be afraid to strike up conversations (your accent will be a good ice breaker!) Personally I'm not a sociable type so I avoid busy pubs if I'm on my own.

When you've finished your drink it's good etiquette to take your glass back to the bar.

ADVANCED SECTION - ROUNDS

We've looked at the basics of solo drinking, now let's talk about rounds. Rounds are where people drinking in a group will take it in turns to buy the drinks.

If you're drinking in a group, it's good etiquette to get the first round. This is accomplished by asking ""what does everyone want to drink?"" or even just ""my round"" or ""I'll get 'em in [the drinks]"". Everyone will tell you your drink order. Memorise it and go to the bar, remembering what we learned in the first lesson about proper queuing and ordering etiquette. When you've purchased everyone's drink convey them back to your friends. (Note: Handling 3 or 4 pint glasses at once is possible, but will be covered in the ""Expert"" version of this guide at a later date.) When the drinks are finished someone else will say ""right, my round"" and will buy the drinks for the group. And so on. It's considered very bad etiquette to accept drinks as part of a round without buying a round yourself. Don't be that guy.

FOOD

Many pubs serve food but there are differences in how the food is ordered and served.

OPTION 1 - Standard pub serving food.

There will be a mixture of seats, but no formal seating arrangement. When you buy your first drink ask to see a menu. Take a seat and, when you're ready to order, go back to the bar and  order your food. If your table has a number on it, make note of it as you'll be asked for your table number when ordering. You'll probably be asked to pay for the food immediately. (Again, no need to tip.) Someone will bring your food to you when it's ready.

OPTION 2 - The ""Gastropub""

These are superficially pubs but they have aspirations to being a serious restaurant. These type of pubs are probably closest to what you're used to in the states. When you enter there will be a ""greeter"" who will seat you at a table. You'll order your food from a server and you'll pay the bill at the end. Tipping is not essential but at this type of establishment you may wish to tip 10-20% if the food and service have been exceptional.

OPTION 3 - The hybrid

This type of pub is dying out I feel, but basically it will be split in two, with one half of the pub a traditional ""drinking"" pub with maybe some snack-type food, with the other half of the pub a more formal ""sit-down"" type of restaurant.

"It seems to be just down to the name ""Great Britain"" being used in the 1896 games and it sticking since then.

"tl;dr those who vote for Labour leader and those who vote at a General Election are very different constituencies.

In a recent survey, 77.9% of people polled identified as centre-left, centre-centre or centre-right.

It's widely believed that the winner a of general election is the party that most appeals to the centre.

Corbyn, on the other hand, is widely regarded as left-left, not centre-left.

So there is a disconnection for Corbyn- he is simultaneously very popular with Labour members but regarded sceptically by the wider electorate.

The Blair generation came to power because it decided that the only way to deal with the diminishing number of traditional working class Labour supporters (caused by the decline of the industries in which these people worked) was to move towards the centre and have 'New Labour' values.

Corbyn represents the reboot of older Labour values. His supporters see this as the rebirth of genuine socialist politics, that have been dormant since, well, a long time ago.

Those Labour supporters who are saying this won't work are either themselves centrist or believe you must appeal to centrists to win.

One reason so many MPs are against Corbyn is that MPs are elected by all voters, not just party members or party activists, and when they are actually being an MP, they represent even the people in their constituency who did not vote for them. They hear what people who voted for them but are 'swing' voters (or even people who did not vote for them) are saying.

So sceptics see Corbyn's success as a blind alley- that he can win over those who vote for Labour leader, but not the whole electorate.

In addition, not everyone sees Corbyn ""as a Prime Minister."" They just did a vox pop outside Anfield after the match and asked a random supporter, who said 'He's a nice chap, but I don't think he can cut it on the world stage.'
