"Because, god intended the waters of hot and cold to be kept separate. It is not our place to interfere with His Divine Plan."
The News. A gripping tale set in an alternate reality where an orange US President cannot help making hilarious statements and crass decisions.
"Hmm. I'd like to see tougher regulations on what can be considered an apprenticeship.

I've been trying to help my brother find an apprenticeship and you have to wade through so much shit to find any half decent ones. 

Places like Poundland, Subway, etc should not be offering apprenticeships - unless it's for a position in their corporate offices. "
A healthcare system shouldn't be run for profit it should be run for the public good. It should be run for the benefit of the people rather than the shareholders.
"A UKIPer being a fact denying moron, how surprising."
"Allow all shops across the UK to stay open for 24 hours on a Sunday.

The current law is ridiculous and has no justification whatsoever."
He sounds over sensitive and a little stupid. Don't know why he is talking to an American in America about people down south. There isn't North/South tension. Mostly London vs the rest of the UK. Mostly banter.
"A police officer cannot convict you of anything - he doesn't have the power.  
You'll get a summons to court where you may be convicted.  
  
Get a solicitor."
"I was at a science after Brexit debate last night, and a physician on the panel who'd be a UKIP candidate in 2015 referred to it as ""so-called"" climate change... So there are still some deniers. "
"Erm...

Regaining British control of Cadburys would be my first priority. "
"You wouldn't know if you had been. The data gathering is done via survey type sites but they don't tell you what it is for.

"**Rubber dinghy rapids bro**. Four Lions is a hell of a dark, tragic, funny film. I've no idea how it would be received by a non-Brit."
"If you asked at r/Unitedkingdom I'm not surprised they gave a frosty response!

They're all still in bed at lunchtime,  probably getting some rest before an evening protest against whatever 'evil' has riled them this week, or frantically signing petitions against... stuff.

"Why on earth would you want a bloody mixer tap. Accept your heritage and understand that separate taps, and no access to pineapples is what made Brian great!

"Considering that her parents accidentally killed her and hid the body, I'm surprised they want to stay in the media spotlight in the first place?

I guess hiding in plain sight it a good tactic. Certainly worked well for Jimmy Savile."
"Probably Sainsbury's, they actually changed the bags to make them sturdier and more like the bag for life ones when they introduced the 5p charge, all the other supermarkets just started charging 5p for the same old bags.  
  My personal preference is for the normal ones though because it's easier to tie the handles together when you use them for rubbish"
"The article that I [read](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/dec/15/new-police-officers-face-degree-requirement) suggested that new recruits without a degree would be required to study part-time for a degree as part of a 3 year training programme, and be given time-off to study for that degree while also working and being paid £21k to £23k.

This sounds like a great deal to me. I wish all employers were willing to invest in a structured training programme like that for staff that join straight out of school."
Nice try Theresa
"Where are you from, to give us an idea? Assuming normal Christian-ish service:

For the most part you'll meet everyone at the church (or whether the service is) for the service portion. There will be a booklet to follow so you just need to do what everyone else does.

Then you'll go to wherever the burial or cremation is - this may be the same place, but might involve travelling again. Likewise, there's not much to do - just follow everyone else.

Then, generally, there will be a wake of some description. It's a kind of party, but how much of a party will vary greatly - in the UK this is often at somebodies house or in a Pub but may be somewhere posher. Expect drinking, nibbles and emotions. 

For the most part just wear a black suit (unless instructed otherwise) and keep it solemn. The usual 'I was so sorry to hear - he was a great man') type stuff is fine.  Beyond that its reading your audience - some will love to hear all about your relationship with him whereas for others it'll just be too raw."
"Even if they didn't, they left 3 young children in a hotel room alone in a foreign country while they went out for dinner with their friends. How they were never charged with negligence is beyond me."

I've been here for 25 years and I'm yet to damage a bayonet cap fitting.  What are you even doing to them?
"Completely forgot this term until you mentioned it there now.

It actually sounds pretty weird reading it as an adult. As a kid I was just like ""sure, that's just another word"""
"I'm a girl, and if I found out a guy I was seeing/thinking of seeing was a red piller, I'd end our relationship immediately. I have zero time for that 'women are just looking for a strong alpha to take control of them, neg them to make them like you' bullshit. "
"Co-Op. Shit pay, pay that cut off when the shop closed (we were expected to stay back, clean up, cash up, and lock down in our own time), expensive and shit-quality food. 

The event that made me quit was when my manager came up to me one day, with a look of panic across her face, to tell me that a customer had lost a £20 somewhere in our shop, and if I (or anyone) found it, it was to be put to the tills because they were short for the week, and I was just supposed to lie to the customer if I saw them. I subsequently met the customer in question - it was Janice, one of our elderly regulars with whom I chatted near-daily, who was naturally pretty distressed at losing the money. My boss at the 'ethical supermarket' wanted me to lie to *her*.

Fuck them."
"Well, if you were given 100 seconds to name as many countries with [obscure property], where by country we mean a sovereign state that's a member of the UN in its own right, you might take an educated guess as to what it was for."
"It's not you, it's us"
I'm sure retail workers would disagree with you.
"I feel sorry for you if you've been spending time in incels and the red pill. That is not the real world at all. A bunch of gremlins that feed off their own self hatred is not a way you want to live your life.

Uni is a glorious place, meeting girls at Uni is as easy as going to any pub near the campus or the SU or any of the events organised on every night of the week.  

I'd say the people you meet at uni you'll bond with way quicker than people you met at school because you'll share similar interests and everybody is way more chilled and open than you are at school."
Only Connect. What other quiz show can you watch and be honestly overjoyed to even get one correct answer?
"There is a lot of joking about it, but there are definitely underlying issues that can cause people to take it more seriously. The main cause of it all is that the North is traditionally industrial, while the South is more financial (huge generalisation!). This means that Southerners work in offices and wear suits so are ""pansies"", ""fairies"" and the like, while Northeners work in jobs which traditionally require less formal education and work with their hands so they're ""dirty"" and ""monkeys"". Add to that the weather (it's cold up North), the landscape (rolling hills vs rugged cliffs, mountains and moors) and the difficult accents and it's easy to see the difference in the ""hard"" North and the ""soft"" south

The tensions come from the fact that while the financial sector is a strong, well paying sector, the industrial side has collapsed over the years and therefore areas in the North were left in poverty. The growing technology industries are also down south, so while the South goes from strength to strength the North often feels abandoned. Financial investment from the government (especially Tory governments) goes to supporting the money makers, so rail networks, road networks, communications and everything else that is a part of every day life sees huge money piled into it down south while the North is often a bit forgotten."
"Not a law to be passed as such,  but I'd commission and immediate review of education.  I have a genuine fear that the British education system is failing to prepare our kids for the challenges of the future.  All the effort seems to be in giving them skills that are least likely to equate to value in the future jobs market. 
I'd also want to start a realistic discussion around the NHS that started with the words no politician wants to use ""we all know we can't afford the current NHS forever.  Let's talk about the services we really want to keep free and look at building a sustainable NHS"" 
That should be enough to ensure I'm not in that job for long "
In what way is a physician an expert in climate change?

Something like a sweat shop tshirt I'd guess from primark. There's an argument for mobile phones because of the conflict minerals in them
"On the wake part it's worth pointing out that in Scotland it tends turn into a bit of an all day piss up / family reunion, with pies etc... (like a less merry wedding reception) whereas in England it usually ends up being a short sombre thing with a few drinks but usually coffee. The ceremony itself will be at the cemetery/church/crematorium/whatever, as per your invitation.  Wear a shirt and black jacket and black tie. Just a normal business one will do. Black (I. E wool) raincoat or umbrella for outside burials."
"Read the book ""Risk"" by Dan Gardner - it has a chapter on a section of subjects (terrorism, child abduction, disease etc) and details how the modern world has never been safer or better than it is now. Statistically speaking, now is the safest period in history for pretty much everybody. 

People love to look back and go ""oh the Victorians had it right, kids could go and play in the streets and nobody minded"" and well yes, they did - but those streets were literally paved with horse shit, and those kids who weren't up chimneys then dying in their teenage years were at real risk of being abducted or dying in a million other ways. 

In the same way people make out things were better before ""Health and Safety"", but it literally was the opposite of that - people were sent to work in horrible jobs with no thought, and never returned. It was extremely common for the only breadwinner in the house to get killed in a horrible way at work and never come home, dumping the rest of his family into poverty as there was no concept of welfare. 

We've quite literally never had it so good. "
"“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”  
“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.  
“I don’t much care where–” said Alice.  
“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.  
“–so long as I get SOMEWHERE,” Alice added as an explanation.  
“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long enough.”

"They are wrong.

I used to work nights in a supermarket. We'd have about 15 people working from midnight until 6am. On Sunday nights, we were closed, so we'd only have 14 people because we didn't need a security guard. That was the only difference."

"I agree that the guy in the OP is overly sensitive/taking it too far, but north/south tension is definitely real. I feel it myself sometimes. Although I will say it feels like its very one way in that some northerners feel resentment towards the south, but no southerners resent the north."

"I work within Lloyd's where today's story about a lunchtime drinking ban has come from. The reason that drinking culture is so prevelant within the Lloyd's market is that our entire industry is concentrated within a ten minute walk, max. This lends itself to face to face meetings, and chance catch ups. If you have a spare hour, one of the most productive things you can do is grab a sandwich or a pint with a broker/underwriter. It might not need to be about anything specific, but general market chatter leads to opportunities. If you go into any of the pubs in the area, chances are you'll run into someone you know, and catch up. People who don't get out of the office aren't as well connected, and don't do as well. That's why there is such a pub culture."
