"No, nobody will mind you feeling kinship. It would be weird to reject a former colony like that.

What people across Europe do scoff at is the American habit of taking this to the extreme of saying ""I'm from [X]"" due to ancestral blood relations. You sort of stray into this area when you say that ""Western Europe is where I evolved"".

When we say ""I'm from"" we mean that it's where we were born and where we spent at least our childhood. It's purely a cultural statement. Nobody pays attention to ancestry because it's all so mixed up over here. For instance, someone this week said to me ""I'm from Greece, originally"". He's spent long enough in other countries that he felt the need to qualify his statement.

If your ancestors emigrated from Birmingham (for example) and you go up to a brummie and say ""I'm from Birmingham too!"" he will laugh in your face because you are very clearly from America."

"The odds are these kids have forgotten about you already. They got their stupid giggles out of being dicks and have moved on with their lives. They saw you were getting upset / flustered / angry and that just fuels these kinds of kids. 

However, on the very small chance that it does escalate, if you really felt threatened and think that there is any chance they could come back, I would call 101 and ask to file a police report. You may get asked to go down to a station and do it in person. The police are not going to be able to do anything really but they will have a report on file should anything further happen, it shows a pattern of harrassment that they can then take action against. If they get multiple reports then they might add extra patrols in the area or even figure out where the kids live if they are already known to the police or have been causing trouble elsewhere.

It's worth using the opportunity to re-assess your personal and home safety/security. Make sure you feel confident for the future - they were probably just stupid kids but if they weren't, what could you do to make yourself safer? Do you carry a personal alarm? Are all your window and doors secure? Do you have a security light outside to deter anyone?"
Best phoning the council it would come under noise pollution if its a mosquito alarm. I thought they was banned.
"So I'm also American, from a working class background, who then moved over here to the UK 17 years ago.

And God, I'm realising how long this is right now. I'm sorry. I have opinions.

&gt; 1) Do you like the NHS?

*Christ* yes.  Jesus Christ, I love it.

I grew up with knowing that you had to be *really* sick before you could see a doctor. Only one kid could be diagnosed with asthma because that was all we could afford. You bang your head? We'll keep an eye on you, but you're not going to the ER because there is no way we can afford that. Passing medicine around between a family, Mom getting a job at a pediatrician just so we could get some sort of healthcare...  You just did that.  That was how you had to live.

I move over here, it's...god, it's amazing. I used to pay $90 for one month of medication. And that was back in 1998, so we're talking like $135 or so now.

I pay Â£8.40 for two months' worth now.  I pay eleven goddamned bucks.

(And birth control?  **Free**.)

Like 10 years ago, I fell down, hit my head pretty hard on the shitty concrete that makes up most of my garden. I didn't fully black out, but I was close for like five seconds.

My husband panicked and called 999 and they came and saw me.  They talked to me.  They said ""Yeah, we're gonna take you to A&amp;E to get checked out.""  I waited like a half hour in A&amp;E, and I got checked out.  I kept saying ""Naw, it's nothing, I'm sorry to be bothering you"" and they kept repeating ""*No*. This is important.""

When I was a kid, I banged my head really hard against a metal pole while I was rollerskating.  I didn't get quite as dizzy, but I was tired and headachy all day.  You know what my family did?

Told me to stay awake.  No doctor. Nothing. Just stay awake and, y'know, don't die.

Fucking love the NHS. Cannot believe what they do.

&gt; 2) What are some honest flaws, perhaps things the government does not want to look at honestly, or that statistics average away?

The latest episode of [the Private Eye podcast](http://www.private-eye.co.uk/eyeplayer/podcast) deals with the NHS, and points out a lot of the problems that it currently has, and problems it had in the past.

The biggest problem, really, is that the unsexy things get ignored and pushed back constantly.  Why did this huge WannaCry problem happen?  The NHS didn't have the money to keep the Windows updates going or buy new computers. Why not?  Because there was the latest cancer drug that provided maybe a 10% higher chance for 5% of people with a cancer that only appears in 0.00001% of people.  Or there was a massive push to get rid of ""bed blockers"" (people who can't go home because there won't be anyone to take care of them and the social services in the community were cut, so they're outta luck).  Or the Prime Minister wanted a photoshoot in a new ward in a new hospital.

And, yeah, that happens everywhere.  But with something as much of a behemoth as the NHS...it can't happen that way.

Another example - I worked for a year at this small NHS project focused on making sure GPs put in good data.  Nobody thought it was important. We were regularly fobbed off.  But you know what it did?

It made sure that your GP didn't put in you're allergic to pickles when you're actually allergic to penicillin.

&gt; 3) When it comes to improvement, do you support more privatization or less?

Privatisation has fucked *so* much up. It's not just that private business is more concerned with a profit than it is with care.  It's not just that it's usually the lowest bidder.

It's that, as they say in the *Private Eye* podcast, you spend more time working on the entire business of bids than you do on the actual service.  You need consultants and managers and bid writers and accountants and it's just a billion times more *effort*.  Effort and energy that could be spent on actually helping people.

Taking care of people should not be a profit industry."
"No they would not. The attack happened at 10pm on a Saturday night close to a nightlife area. That means that any londoners that would have a carry licence would not be carrying their gun with them because they're going out, or it would be tourists that wouldn't have a gun in the first place.
 Sure, if someone had a gun carry licence, and they were on the bridge, and they weren't hit by the van, and they were at a distance/angle where they would be able to take a shot, and they were good enough of a marksman to hit the attackers but not civilians, and they had their wits about what's actually going on, maybe they'd have shot the terrorists the moment they came out of the van. 

At the same time, allowing people to carry guns would mean that gun crime would go through the roof, the kids that are stabbing each other every week outside their schools would start doing drive bys, and the potential terrorists would have access to guns. 

So no, allowing gun ownership and gun carrying is a stupid idea. "

"Well, we find it a bit silly when Americans say ""I'm Irish"" when their closest relative is 6 generations ago, that said I'm glad trump doesn't wang on about his Scottish mother that much. 

For me it's just a bit odd, you're American, you've got British /Irish /Kazakhstani/whatever roots, great, but how can you feel kinship to somewhere you've never been and that your nearest relative left hundreds of years ago? 

All that said, it's just folk on the Internet, be proud of whatever you like, just expect some eye rolls if you bring it up. "

"The Daily Fail is a very right wing paper for geriatric idiots who just want their insane opinions validated. This means that the Daily Fail is full of items where most British are also thinking ""What?! is that even still an issue!""."
Honestly just keep at it. In the grand scheme of things 20 hours isn't much. I took my lessons really slowly and prob ended up with double that by the time I passed my test. 
"Yes. I'm Engilsh and living / raised in the US. The culture is very different, and it's just fascinating to me.

When people find out I'm English (I lack an accent), the first thing that's always mentioned is how the US ""saved your butts"" in WWII. Then, usually either questions about the UK, which is cool, or comments like ""I bet you don't have &lt;x&gt; on that little island"". In other words, I'd feel more ""kinship"" if it was two-directional, but it is not. 

&gt; In America, people frequently talk about how they are Irish, German, English, or Italian, etc. with a lot of pride. 

Yeah, and I really wish they wouldn't. They aren't. They're American. Often they use these heritages to explain why they drink so much, or as an excuse to drink more (see: St. Patrick's Day in the US, or even Cinco de Mayo). Jokes on them though. Real Irish/German/English/etc don't NEED excuses to drink a lot.

I will say that one of the things I miss THE MOST about England is it's sense of self. English culture can be described, and it can be felt. In the US, culture depends on where you are, who you are talking to, or in some cases who you are / what color your skin is. Some people love the mishmash of cultures. I don't. I like having a culture and being able to point to it and have people recognize it as British.

My two cents is you can't really feel kinship to a place you haven't ever lived or stayed in for extended periods of time. I'm guessing you haven't visited, if you really feel this way I would plan a visit.

Anecdote time: My mom knew a black englishman (this is in the Black Country of England) who felt this way about Jamaica. His family came from there, and he spoke with a thick accent and felt ""connected"" to it and acted all rastafarian. He went there for the first time, came back, re-adopted his original full English accent and said ""it's a shithole I'm never going there again"". "

"I think this is actually a really important point you've hit on that I've not seen clarified before. Americans and Brits (and perhaps others in the wider community) use ""I'm from"" in two different ways to mean two different things.

Brits use it to mean personal origin. Americans use it to refer to heritage. Almost Biblically."
Yes it's true. We have a similar reaction on hearing that few American households have kettles. I've had it explained so many times and I still can't get my head around how you survive without one. Bewildered Brits have been known to spend hours interrogating passing Americans who unwittingly drop it into the conversation.
"Not to be morbid, but which one? [this is a list of known victims](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40153090), there were 7 deaths and it's thought those missing are included in that.

The one thankful thing about this is that we have such great gun control. Knives are so much more survivable, they physicaly reached and stabbed 55 people and only 7 died. If they had had guns they'd have reached far more and each they reached would have been hurt more critically.

Also, 8 minutes from the first 999 call on the bridge to all three being shot dead is an utterly astounding result by the police. I find that incredible, and they definitely lowered the desthtoll considerably."

Yes.

Also, they court the American audience aggressively, and American middle-class middle-aged women go for this sort of stuff too."

"Having an interest in your family history is fine, it's good. wanting to come and see the places that your family originated from, again - it's great, it's a significant part of what the tourist industry sell themselves on.

It only gets annoying when someone who has never been near the country in their lifetime - in fact, the last ancestor who came from  here left a couple of hundred years ago - tries to claim to *be* English (or Scottish, Welsh or Irish).

Or even worse - do that ""more British than the Brits"", thing, (though it's mostly Scottish and Irish identities they latch on to for that. ""Scottish-Americans"" and their views on the referendum to leave the UK can be very annoying).

"As I understand it Italian style has a thin, and usually slightly crispy, crust.  American is basically the toppings on a large loaf of bread.....  (slight ~~exaduration~~ exaggeration there, but not much)

This is the top answer from Quora when I googled ""italian vs american pizza""

&gt; The primary difference is a difference in philosophy.

&gt; In Italy, they feel that only a few flavors are needed if those flavors are at their best.

&gt; In America, they've adopted a culture of convenience for food.  Quality ingredients have been sacrificed in exchange for constant availability and long shelf-life.

&gt; Italian pizza is as simple as it can get.  A fresh made dough cooked in a brick oven, with tomato sauce made from real tomatoes with mouth watering flavor, not too sweet and a bite of acid.  That is topped with fresh mozzarella cheese that was probably inside the buffalo two days ago.  If it's a Margherita pizza, there will be a few fresh basil leaves sprinkled atop.

&gt; While bad pizza can be found in Italy, real Italian pizza (particularly in Naples) is one of the most amazing things you will ever eat.

&gt; American pizza uses tomatoes that have been bred for ruggedness at the expense of flavor.  The sauce is loaded with sugar.  The pizza uses cheese that is loaded with preservatives and has been sitting in a plastic zip locked bag for a month.  Because the flavors are muted there is a tendency to add more and more flavors - a cacophony of half a dozen toppings of mediocre quality.

&gt; While excellent pizza can be found in America, most is just greasy and overloaded with an incoherent mix of flavors."
"But they are getting there? Do you remember that IPA was invented by the Brits in about 1820, later adopted in the states just 20 years ago...
Don't forget we have been brewing beer before your country even existed, and tell me 90% Americans don't think beer is a ""bud light"", or one of the million variations on the same weak piss water that consume an entire isle in your supermarkets?

6.45am take off, I'd aim to be there at 4.45 AT THE LATEST if I'm honest.

"I'd say they are further right than the GOP. They were set up by an evangelical preacher, Ian Paisley, and are known for having fundamentalist religious views, e.g. one senior member blamed Hurricane Katrina on the gays. There are more such comments about gays you can look them up for yourself. 

They are fervently pro-union - at all of their winning counts last night they would all have union flags to celebrate, and in the past they have sang God Save the Queen at counts. 

They are quite anti-immigrant - former leader made comments about muslim, a current MP, Sammy Wilson, was recorded agreeing with someone saying 'get the ethnics out'.

In the last year our government collapsed because they oversaw a renewable heating scheme which lost nearly half a billion to rich farmers and allies of the DUP. Such corruption has also been seen in the NAMA Scandal and Red Sky. We still have no government because Sinn Fein want the DUP leader, Arlene Foster to step aside while an investigation takes place. 

I've seen a lot of people say how the DUP is linked to terrorists. This is in many parts true, but is a bit exaggerated. They were linked in the past to a group and their former leader took over a village in Ireland with other loyalists, but they haven't killed anyone. In this election they were endorsed by the UDA, whom Arlene Foster met with just days after the UDA murdered someone as part of a drugs feud. There is also a video of the current MP for East Derry, Gregory Campbell, talking about how he would take up arms.

Edit: Further to the above... I think the real message of this cartoon is that The Conservatives (Theresa May) won't be able to achieve a majority vote on anything *unless* they have the buy in of the DUP. Soooo... The DUP can effectively negotiate a kick-back in return for their support so they've got The Conservatives ""in their pocket"". It's worth knowing that The DUP have some particularly zealous views on abortion, same sex marriage and other stuff that most right thinking people got over years ago. Fun times ahead..."
