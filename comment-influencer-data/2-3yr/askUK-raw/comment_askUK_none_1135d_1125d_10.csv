"I reckon the Inbetweeners are fairly accurate, especially for boys of that age."
"Surprised no one has said Peep Show yet. Definitely a certain kind of person and British life, but it's there."
"Robot Wars.

No, seriously!  Shows like Robot Wars, Scrapheap Challenge, and Great British Bake Off, are an accurate (if slightly heightened) depiction of British life.

People having a laugh with their hobby, not taking winning too seriously, helping each other out, improvising with what you have, lashings of cheeky innuendo, stiff upper lip when things go a bit pear-shaped, welcoming anyone who is willing to muck-in, friendly rivalry and ribaldry, sarcasm towards authority, building, making, designing, perfecting, demolishing.

We're a country of happy amateurs.

Either that or EastEnders where everyone is a drug addled prostitute with a grim secret about the child she gave away because her second husband killed her first husband because her lesbian lover bought a pub from a guy who stole it from his nan while she was in hospital because her long-lost brother conned her out of her money even though she *wasn't his real mum*.

So, one of the two."
"Yes, and it's not exclusive to the UK either.

You guys are the weird ones. "
"Advice from my girlfriend who is a nurse:

Contact ""Home Instead"" - if you google them, they are a national company who can provide care services including overnights/befriending for exactly this situation. You could probably list the agency as your contact."
"It's OK, if he tries any funny business just kick him in the... oh."
Come Dine With Me is a pretty great representation of well-founded regional stereotypes.
"Peep Show

Jeremy and Mark cover a very wide spectrum of British people between them."
I'll be a friend for 24 hours. I'll bring my PlayStation and some movies. Just don't attack me please.
"Different markets. 

Larger supermarkets are targeted at people stocking up on weekly supplies, for use when needed. Smaller supermarkets are more likely in convenient, central locations, and are more likely to be used to purchase items that will be consumed immediately (eg snacks/drinks).

I see what you're saying, supermarkets are so big they could easily dedicate a bit of fridge space for a few cold beers. Generally though, most people aren't going to big supermarket to get a few cold beers, they'll stock up on more and put it in the fridge when needed, whilst people might go to a small shop for that."

Seconding The Inbetweeners. It's a bit outdated now but I think Two Pints of Lager... was okay for everyday life too.
"Sounds like a scummy landlord. I would tell him to get lost. If it was legit, he can take it to court. I would only respond to a court summons as you are legally required to at that point. "
Police Interceptors on Channel 5.
"Definitely. The location, the antics, the characters - all terrifyingly similar to my own teenage years."
I forgot she was prime minister. I don't think I've seen nor heard a whisper of news about her since she started. 
Most people I know do wear them. 
"The Royle Family, for working class culture. It's a comedy so some aspects are exaggerated, obviously, but not by a huge amount - and the *spirit* of the programme is so bang-on that it sometimes kind of hurts."
"Warehouse raves happen every now and then but honestly you don't want to go to them. They're extraordinarily drug-heavy, shitty music and generally a bad crowd. You need to usually know someone already going (who will know someone, who will know someone) to be able to get in. 

Misfits and skins aren't accurate representations of teen life in the UK. The Inbetweeners is far far more accurate. "
It's why I hated it at first. It was too real for me.

"I'd say we are far more conservative than most of Europe. Every time I meet my German, Spanish, French friends it's all hugging and arms round shoulders *while sober(!)*. It takes a bit of getting used to."
Oh. In that case I declare my boycott a success!
"[The only option.](http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/images/reviews/190/1261531220_1.jpg)

*it's vulcanised rubber, which means it won't perish*"
"I think The Office captures it pretty well that show is, what 10 years old now?  Still doesnt feel dated and as I work in an office there are things that apply and are relevant to that, warehouse/office divide in cultures etc. 

Also Inbetweeners is on point, everyone sees Skins and thinks that will be their summer, where as the reality is getting Rapey on a camping holiday etc..."
"I've never been to the US so I couldn't comment on your men, but I'm happy to hug a close male friend as a greeting, nor am I afraid to let them know I love them, although on meeting we'd also typically spend the first five to ten minutes insulting each other and then get down to proper conversation. I wouldn't do similar to females friends though. "
"Guns?

(sorry)"

Reconsider going to London then. "
"Report it to your local cop shop, saying someone seems to be impersonating a police vehicle, and send them the video if necessary. They should attend to the van pretty quickly, judging from my experience (20-30 years ago mind) when a takeaway shop near me put a flashing blue light on their sign - police were there in 20 minutes."
"No it's not normal, it's disgusting.  Most people would find it horrible.

There's a common stereotype of receptionists filing their nails at their desks. I'm not sure ho much truth there is to that. But again, people see that as unpleasant."
"Same goes for Spaced. Even though a lot of it looks quite outdated now, and it only represents a subset of British culture (with a lot of international pop culture references thrown in) but it does it well."
"Talk more quietly than you usually do, then more quietly than that."
It's actually quite horrifying when you watch it years later.
There's a redditor round these parts who'll probably give you a great deal on 500 tonnes of bramley apples.
"We don't have the weird 'butt-slap' thing. So much US media has sports guys casually slapping each others' bums and acting like its the most macho, straight guy thing in the world and I'm like wtf."
"She's good at marketing. Beyond that, she hasn't really been tested as there's no effective opposition right now."
"Why do americans always over-pathologize and over-analyze everything that isn't American? It's like they think humans outside of America are some strange sub-species.

*""I hear that in the UK you say Zed instead of Zee, does this relate to the primal urges of hunter gatherers to identify who is foe and who is friend?""*

*""I hear that in the UK you say sorry if you bump in to someone, is this because you are trying to initiate sex with them?""*

*""I hear that in the UK you like to make jokes about yourselves, is this some deep rooted shame that your queen makes you feel by being her subordinate subjects?""*

Christ alive, stop being so fucking alien."
"Why in God's name should there be a social convention on which side of the path you walk on? If you can't walk down the road without walking into people, you should stay home. "

"Congrats on the baby.

My biggest lifestyle-related observations when I came to Britain were:

- Trains (and public transport in general) are not great. They're not the worst thing in the world, but they're definitely a pain in the butt and you are broadly speaking better off living near where you want to work.

- British houses/apartments are smaller than what you might expect, and you will need to adapt to buying only what you need.

- The weather is as bad as you think it will be. Invest in a really good coat, and a decent umbrella.

- Don't live in a floodplain area - no matter how cheap the place may be and no matter how tempting it is, it's not worth it.

- The NHS is an excellent service and you will be in good hands, but you will need to be proactive in terms of finding the right GP/pharmacy/dentist for your needs. Like anything else in life, it's not consistently great and there are areas that are better than other.

- Finding a job is easy **if** you have some experience in something (i.e. if you are a 'skilled' worker) and provided you have right to work in the UK. Not all employers are equipped to deal with the whole visa sponsorship thing. If you have no experience/qualifications, you will probably struggle.

- Paperwork-wise, you can do most things online, visit www.gov.uk for a full plethora of tools/portals.

- About your baby: you may benefit from checking out NCT.org.uk

- When deciding whether to move into an area, consider if the local schools are any good (check the Ofsted reports) - even if your family doesn't need to use education services at this point in time, school performance is often indicative of the area's demographic and socioeconomic performance. You can also check www.police.uk to see if there have been many crimes logged in recent months/years.

- On that note, I notice you said you already know where you are moving to... I would suggest that you may want to visit the city's subreddit to ask the locals about good places to go and places to avoid.

- Bonus: You will struggle to find poutine anywhere!"
"Hi, I'm an ex-pat.

I'm now called Dave. It's an interesting transition, but with the NHS help it was smooth. In this country no one cares what you were or become."
"To manager:

I'm working in a customer facing role with your brand across my chest. I'll be wearing the same clothes for more 50hrs a week without washing them because I can't dry then between shifts. 

Your call

Sincerely peon"
"Yeah for me it's Inbetweeners as a teen, Peep Show as an adult, maybe with a good chunk of The Office thrown in. Maybe even Fresh Meat as a uni student in between. They got the house and some of the characters spot on. Everyone knows a fucking Josie, an Oregon, a Kingsley etc."

and we all knew at least one guy with Simon's hair cut.
"Having lived in both places, yes, I've definitely noticed that in the UK (and most other cultures, frankly, even ones where homosexuality is illegal) men are much more comfortable with affection and less concerned with ""fuck you bro thats gay"". You really have quite a conservative culture, but don't realise it.

It's pretty much an American insecurity. Though I do see evidence that American men are finally starting to get over it, at least in the more progressive parts of the US."

"Came here to say this, I think every group of friends has at least one story that could be an episode of the inbetweeners. "
Wild French people are uncommon in the UK. And usually need cleaned before consumption. 
You very well could and unless you are absolutely unbelievably good at your job then I suspect you probably will. Why did you lie?
