Nothing.
I won a major prize the other night. I popped in on my work break and i could not believe my eyes i had to get the cashier to double check i wasnt losing the plot but no it was true i really did win a medium size drink. 
"No-one would care at all.  It is truly irrelevant.  

tl;dr:  No significance whatsoever."
"You're leaving, who gives a shit what the team think? It's a guaranteed salary whilst looking for another job, why are you even thinking twice? Believe me; bosses like that do *not* come around often, if ever"
That you exist. In Geography class.
That's got nothing to do with her ability to teach. It's term end today. Watching a movie and chilling it is pretty much par for the course.
"It's the last day of term, so as a teacher myself I don't really care. You need some self preservation tactics. 

If she does it *all* the time then that's another issue."
"A 'sesh' isn't really just going out drinking, it's starting a friday evening in a pub, then going to a club and having some special sweeties, then back to someone's house to come down and smoking weed to help with that, then passing out on their sofa sometime early afternoon, then waking up and going in search of somewhere still serving a fry-up breakfast at 5pm, then having a hair-of-the-dog couple of pints and running into some mates who are going on to a gig later and getting talked into joining them, then back to a house party after that, then staggering out onto the street because someone's thrown up all over the toilet and there's no bogroll left anyway and the rage is building in your guts, finding a 24hour offie that sells both bogroll and Monster and vodka, and clutching these in a bag realising that the gutrage needs releasing, so finding a handy churchyard that hasn't had glass inserted in the tops of its walls and climbing into that and redecorating some graves with the remnants of your 5pm fry-up from both ends of your body, but hey, that's okay, because you've got bogroll, then finding a nice bench in the graveyard to have a bit of a kip on, then waking up when the vicar kicks you as she's got a wedding to prepare for, staggering off to a bus stop to partake of the refreshing Monster and vodka your past self thoughtfully provided for you, before staggering home and getting into the shower to cry for a couple of hours until about 9pm sunday when you log in to Reddit to argue with some people that are Wrong On The Internet for a couple more hours and then passing out on the sofa in front of all the shitty superhero programmes (and Supernatural, which you're not sure why you're still watching) you downloaded from Pirate Bay this week you need to catch up on, then making it up for work on Monday morning to have someone ask you 'good weekend?' and you reply 'yeah, not bad, just had a quiet one really' because you're not sure what happened except that there's a thing in the local paper about satanists desecrating a churchyard that seems vaguely familiar...

Not quite sure how you fit this in on a weekday though, no..."

Maybe his wife is terrible and that's the only peace he gets. 
I hear a drone strike is quite a popular gift from Americans to a foreigners wedding.
"Honestly, the UK is actually pretty excellent by worldwide standards, Japan is one of the few countries which is better."
Yes but those aren't your lorry 
Talking to HR would be the best bet. Just be a bit sensitive as it's clear the guy is having some problems that may be a bit embarrassing for him.

He's probably wondering why that creepy guy at No.4 keeps watching him masturbate
"I think over here it's essentially a religious option for jews and muslims or done for a variety of medical reasons in individual cases, and is increasingly seen as mutilation, and therefore a form of child abuse, when done for religious reasons.  

Think the Americans just see it as normal for whatever reason."
"&gt;I've lived in Germany coming up 4 years, had two jobs here. Barely speak German.

A proper British immigrant."
"Nothing. Why would we?

Not meaning to sound harsh, but school time is pretty finite and there's more than enough world-defining history to choose from (two world wars, the roman empire, the industrial revolution etc).

Something as specific as Lithuania's history is more like something that would be taken as a subject in a University history course, and even then as a voluntary thesis topic."
"NO. Fuck no.

Gross"
"It means absolutely nothing, it was just that personally he'd never considered that his family had been anything but working class. He's not going to get to marry the Queen or get a special membership card or anything."
"This has happened once in the 10 years I've worked at my office. Whilst it's not ideal it was really the only option for the parent. Their childcare was unwell so couldn't look after the children, none of her family were available and she had urgent work that could not be picked up by anyone else or left until another day. Her children were really well behaved and sat quietly at a couple of spare desks doing some colouring and even became our unofficial photocopy girls for the day.

I think as long as the children are well behaved and it's a last resort then it's fine. I think employers and colleagues should be supportive if someone is trying to do the best thing by everyone. However if you're just lazy and couldn't be bothered to sort out childcare for your kids or they're behaving like little brats then that needs to be addressed."
To prevent people breaking in and damaging the lorry when there's nothing inside. 
"Its to signal to other drivers in the layby that the driver is a submissive homosexual, ie ""his back door is open"".   
    
    
Actually its to prevent your curtains being sliced so thieves can look inside. Not only is it expensive to repair it can delay you for hours, mobile curtain repairers are not cheap and are fully booked so you could be sitting there for most of the next day waiting for them. Sure you can driver with a small slice in them but 56mph wind soon makes a small cut a large one and before you know it you have lost most of your curtain (which has caused a pile up on the motorway).

"To win a ps3.  Can't you read?  Honestly, some people."
We have spider's but they're small and not bitey. This isn't Australia. 
"Littering is one of those things that I think should genuinely result in public flogging. It's disgusting, disgraceful, and entirely unnecessary."
"Probably the guy who overplays the 'I'm such a geek' card. Everything about his identity and the only things he'll talk about is somehow related to Nintendo games or comics/anime. 

Now don't get me wrong, I'm into games (on a much smaller level), whatever you're into, that's cool, It's your life and you can do whatever makes you happy in your free time. Just don't give me that judging look if I haven't seen that niche film you just watched. If i'm talking to someone else about football, don't jump in and completely interrupt with the 'did you see that ludicrous display last night' IT crowd quote for the 1000th time just to show how unique you are by not liking 'sportsball'."
Could you have framed this any harder?
"Money.

Seriously, don't fuck about trying to guess what he's into. 14 year-old boys aren't sentimental. Money will actually be appreciated. And give it to him in person, not the parents."
The father/son one is really bizarre to me. How often are the people who say that getting out their members for inter-generational inspection and comparison sessions?
I once mixed Crunchy Nut Cornflakes with banana milkshake and crippling depression.
"I'll give a serious answer, as I have seen one or two of her programs.

A good comparison is against Reggie Yates, and I'll start here. I find Reggie presents himself as having performed a significant amount of personal research prior to filming, and attempts to present a more neutral and well-balanced picture of reality.  He does not attempt to significantly force his prior perceptions onto those, but is more investigatory without causing offence.  (An example was his Australia documentary, as well as South Africa.)

Stacey Dooley is... almost exactly the opposite.  It feels like she performs negligible prior research, and lacks a distinct grasp on the situation.  Most disappointingly,  she enforces her prior opinion on individuals, which cause them to shut down (e.g. in Japan) and makes the documentary extremely poor.   It's deeply frustrating as the topics are actually interesting.  Compare to Reggie Yates who *listens* first, before asking questions in a manner such that the individual opens up and explains their perspective, even if he does challenge them later, we have gained a good understanding of their perspective (which is why I watch a range of documentaries.)

Bluntly, I feel she is so poor she should not be making documentaries for the BBC.  I understand they likely want a female presenter to appeal to different audiences, but surely they can find someone mildly competent.  My wife and I both joke that the BBC just keep sending her to the most dangerous places to see if she'll get herself killed..."
"""Oh this article looks interesting""

 ""Oh, this isn't for me"" "
"I cannot confirm this.  Was not taught Lithuania existed.

Your English is excellent OP."
"I view Feast ice creams as an exercise in archaeology.  The inner chocolate core must be uncovered in pristine condition.  Once revealed and appropriately regarded, it is then devoured."
"UK people don't tend to specify - they just say 8am. I think because the whole country is on the same time, it removes the need for specifying PST or East Coast or whatever.

However, when the time zone is referenced, say scheduling a call with overseas, we would use the appropriate version according to whether daylight savings is in effect or not.  "
"&gt; He is viewed by many Americans as a man who subjected Europeans to Hitler.

That's a bit harsh, especially from the country which stood on the sidelines not wanting to get involved until they were forced into it by the Japanese."
East Asians. 
"Americans have a whole load of myths about this too. It's properly ingrained over there that not circumcizing your kids is A Bad Thing and that they'll have difficulty cleaning themselves etc. - which is patently ridiculous, given that countries where the practice is rare get by just fine.

Yet another case of people in the US doing something a certain way and assuming that their way is both default and the only possible way of doing it."
I like sucking Mini Eggs till the outside loses its structural integrity
"Are you near any commuter routes?

Are there any public buildings near you (hospital, doctors' surgery etc etc)?

I can imagine someone doing a commute and then having a break before they drive on into their work, or whatever else they do.

Another possibility is that someone is watching someone who lives in one of your neighbours' houses. Stalker? Private detective? "
"you seem to be getting a lot of sarcastic comments, but heres my honest stake in it.

* 1) make sure you have the owners permission.

* 2) you will have to make sure the hole is structurally sound. you don't want it collapsing in on itself / causing subsidence. I think you might need council permission^ , might be worth asking your council if there are any regulations etc you are breaking

* 3) if you get below the water table you will need to pump the water out of it. this might cause issues if you end up with blocked drains. 

last of all good luck and have fun. best to explain its not a comercial operation if you contact the council and you are doing it for fun.

^ from memory Fred Dibnah dug a mine shaft in his back garden and it caused a bit of a stink when the council found out. best ask them if they have any regulations.

"It's shaken the country to its very core! He has currently disappeared from Eastenders and rumour has it that he is currently in the Low Countries, amassing an army of Flemish mercenaries to invade England and take back his rightful place on the throne.

In all seriousness, once you go back that far in your ancestry it would be more statistically surprising to find out he *wasn't* descended from Edward III."
"I did a History GCSE that did not include any USSR, let alone any of the history of the post-members. I don't think USSR was mentioned in the years before that either, just Romans and British monarchs mainly."
As a last day of term thing then it's normal. More than once a term is not right. 
Every school I ever went to did this on the last day of term. Chill your beans. 
I won a PS3 years ago. I had to mail my winning ticket in and wait about ten weeks for it to arrive. The best bit is I found the winning ticket in the bin outside lol. 
"same as New Zealand: ""spiders are somewhat rare, and are always very small and don't look very scary at all"" can be used to describe the UK."
"""I hate her please can you agree with me?""

I believe is what OP was going for, but now I just hate both of them."
"This woman behind me eats a fucking Apple at the same time everyday. At 11am exactly, give or take like 20 seconds. 

My eye will involuntarily twitch in the minute leading up to 11am. 

The inevitable crunch sounds like my soul being crushed by the inane routine of my life. 

Also she constantly offers me a crisp. I haven't take her up on the offer once in over 2 years. She is completely oblivious to this fact. 

**I DIDN'T WANT A FUCKING CRISP THE FIRST 600 TIMES SANDRA, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I WANT ONE NOW?!**"
"The bullshitter. At first I thought he was misunderstood, I only saw him in passing from time to time, then I was moved onto his department and now work with him regularly. He's a compulsive bullshitter, he has an answer for *everything*, you say something and he has an immediate fucking knowledgable response. Here's some recent gems:

* The door alarm was going off randomly, he claimed it was ants. They've come out because it's spring and the electric currents from them sets it off every year. It just needed resetting. 
* He's going to get a free mountain bike on the free mountain bike work scheme and it's got 16 gears and climbs up walls. It's not free, it's discounted, he hasn't even researched it enough to bullshit about it properly. 
* It was his idea for the restaurant staff to have tasting sessions of the new menu, but they won't credit him with it. 
* I was talking about wanted an expensive car but can't afford it, so he said he could whip up £35k+ in a couple of weeks easily, it's nothing. Says the man in the same minimum wage job for the last 10+ years. 
* He's always got big business plans involving gaming or computing, and he's on the edge of a breakthrough, he's going to make shitloads from it, see point above about being in same low paid job for decades. 
* I joked about wanting roller skates at work, he said we trialled them once and it didn't go well. We also had pogo shoes and he nearly shot through the roof. 

Literally anything you talk about, he has a genius response, no delay, no thought, just a straight up answer out of his arse. I can't cope with it any more, the more you argue the more he talks, he won't back down, he just goes on, and on...

"truly it takes the rest of your life.

it does diminish in intensity as time goes by.

i still think of friends who passed decades ago, though usually not with sadness, just longing to converse with them again."
In no ways.
"6 a.m? Could be someone coming off a shift, and having a nap for half an hour before going home, because they don't want to disturb the family who keeps normal hours.

When I have had time to kill in the car, I've often chosen to park near some houses rather than slap bang on the open road."
"It means one of the orphaned slaves forced to work there has escaped. 

When I used to work there, it meant manager's office. It may have changed. "
Of Mice and Men. Actually not a bad book. Curley keeping his hand in a glove was kinda confusing at the time but I understood it as the years rolled on. 
"&gt; But it's so strong that it even smells when he's not here.

Are you sure it's him and not you?"
"Don't flush the toilet in the middle of the night unless it's a poo, in which case you should shout loudly and clearly ""it was a poo, it was a poo""."
"Take it to the landlord as a complaint - ""I have moved in and the service you are providing to me is not as described"". The sooner you do this the better as it is not really possible to take this approach once you stop being a ""new"" tenant."

"It's very British humour.

You might argue that the English language is derived from a number of different sources, meaning there are loads of unexpected connections (and disconnections) between sounds, meanings and how things are written on the page.

So puns really suit us.

Or maybe we are just a silly people. 

Puns are really big in our sense of humour.... "
"I don't remember learning a single thing about Lithuania when I studied it at GCSE, sorry op "
"Probably the hypocrisy of it I suppose.

With regard the WWII it's pretty galling to have stood alone against Germany with a civilian population  under nightly bombing raids for years on end while the US was still profiting from selling to the Nazis then afterwards to hear ""You'd be speaking German if it wasn't for us"" from a country who until they were attacked by Japan didn't want to get involved in fighting Nazism and indeed even then didn't declare war on Germany themselves but waited for Hitler to declare war on them.

Those Americans who believe that their country took a moral stand against the aggression of Nazi Germany seem to forget that very many Americans were either supportive of Germany, sympathetic to them or at the very least apathetic while half of Europe was being razed to the ground."
"Yeah, they'll keep them in London to pave the streets with."
"I have an annual wage but I have never actually worked out what I earn per hour. After tax I would probably not be too happy.

I remember being on £6 an hour in a shitty job as a teenager. I was fucking amazed by it. Every ten minutes I would think ""I've made another quid!"". "
