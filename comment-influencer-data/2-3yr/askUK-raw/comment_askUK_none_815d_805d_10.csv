"1945-1979 Britain was a country that was working on reducing the wealth gap as social policies and public services came into being (see the NHS). However, there were also a lot of problems such as strikes and the public lost faith in Labour. 

Thatcher and her Tory government subscribed to neoliberalism and free market ideology. Basically, if you make the rich richer through a thriving economy then the money will spread down to the workers and they will be able to support themselves, i.e. no need for social housing or healthcare. This is what is known as Reaganomics, or a trickle down economy. The Conservative party today still follows it. 

What Thatcher did was to concentrate on turning Britain from an industrial nation to one where banking, finances and services reigned. On a grand scale this made the country itself richer and the wealthy certainly benefited. If you're familiar, think of the Yuppie culture that existed both in the US and the UK. But it also meant the poor got poorer as industries like coal mining were decimated. There were whole towns in the North where everyone's dad lost his job and children who were prepped for a life in industry suddenly had no prospects. For reference, think of the culture of films like Billy Elliot, Kes or Full Monty. These effects are still felt today in many of these communities as the money never realistically poured down. Many chose to leave if they could and so towns lost their smartest whilst those that stayed witnessed the collapse of these communities. 

Whether this was right is an argument that will always rage on. Those in the north and typically working class will argue that Thatcher destroyed them to make herself and her cronies rich and that she never cared for them. Those on the opposite side will argue that the country was ""the sick man of Europe"" (think the economies of Greece, Spain or Italy today) and that Thatcher made tough decisions to fix that. "
"In the case of Rolls-Royce, they were bankrupted by cost overruns on the development of the RB211 jet engine. 

So the government stepped in and bought the company, allowing the development to continue. The engine was a fantastic success, and it turned Rolls-Royce into the global leader in jet engines. 

By nationalising Rolls-Royce, the government kept the jobs and the expertise in the country, and the company was later sold at a profit for the government and taxpayers. 

I would say that even the most ardent capitalist can see how the nationalisation of Rolls-Royce was beneficial to the country and taxpayers. 

It wasn't an entirely different story for Jaguar: the owners made a series of bad decisions, and the government nationalised British Leyland to save the jobs, plants and expertise. This wasn't a great success like Rolls-Royce though.

In contrast, long after British Steel was privatised, and when the crisis hit, there was a huge slowdown in the sale of steel for construction (also prices were depressed by dumping by China). The government could have stepped in and kept those jobs and the expertise by keeping the plants running and stockpiling the steel. Instead, 10,000 jobs were lost and the infrastructure is now gone, the skills will be lost, and the plants will never reopen. 

The government used the excuse that the EU wouldn't let them step in and subsidise or nationalise the plants, even though this was clearly untrue as other EU countries did exactly that at that time. Another example of the political cowardice of UK governments (Tory and Labour are equally bad for this) blaming the EU for their own policies. 

I think what I'm trying to say is that nationalisation can be good for the economy, even if you don't believe in ""the means of production being owned by the workers"" (which I for one don't). 

Nationalisation and privatisation are dog-whistle words, and perhaps we should all be a bit more pragmatic about them. "
"Just to add to what is a fantastically balanced response by reddit standards, you also have to look at the world of the 1970's.

Things were nationalised even beyond Jeremy Corbyn's deepest darkest fantasies.  The government owned the trains, water, energy, the post office, the phones (it was actually illegal to use an non-BT sold telephone at home).  But then also companies like BP, Rolls Royce, Jaguar, British Steel, medical research firms and many more.

Some of these were maybe better off in public ownership (gas, electricity, maybe trains), some even a socialist would find it hard to argue weren't right to be privatised (Jaguar).

Whilst some of what Thatcher did was ideological, some was simply clearing out ""dead wood"".  Industries that only survived due to government hand outs and/or ownership.

The problem was that sometimes whole communities and regions (in the case of coal) relied on these industries.  Despite a lot of money since being spent by various governments, has anything taken their place, and is it these same areas who turned so heavily to Brexit and UKIP as they were sick of being ignored?"
"I'm advocating pragmatism, not ""nationalise all the things"". 

The RB211 wasn't a flop. And although the market for high-quality steel for construction and shipbuilding is picking up again, the UK is no longer well-placed to exploit it. The resources are being directed elsewhere into unemployment and housing benefits for ex-steelworkers. 

I don't know if nationalising parts of the steel industry would have panned out, but the government rejected it **because of ideology, not pragmatism**. 

The countries which nationalised banks early in the crisis have done *much* better getting the bail-out money back for the taxpayers than those who left it late (or didn't nationalise at all) and instead gave ""limited bail-out loans""."

"If I'm a tenanted landlord for Enterprise, for example and want to sell Heineken. I'm contractually obliged to buy it at their price. Currently £195.

If I'm a Free House operator, I can buy the same Heineken from an online wholesaler for £125. Assuming all other factors are the same, that one detail alone has just shaved off 70p off the price of the pint. 

Now, let's say I control the lager sales of 100 outlets. Heineken will be *very* keen to cut the middle man out. The price will be on a contract by contract basis. And they'll be more than happy to drop my price if I'm selling enough. (Although they're also likely to fit my crew out with uniforms, buy me a new set of taps, a self-cleaning line, and a fancy fridge to keep my glasses in so they look all that much more refreshing - OK, I've had to dribble cheap scarves all over the bar as well for the rugby... But hey ho)

Because Wetherspoons own their houses outright, they can even out compete standard free houses. They reached this position with the genius move of renovating old churches and theatres, and other significant public buildings that have fallen out of use, but are ideally located in the middle of the town, rather than buying and updating pubs. They are not tarnished by a poor reputation from the past, or price gouged by buying an existing customer base. If you buy a run down pub, it takes a long time to convince the public it isn't a shit hole any more. But it's expensive to buy a good pub. 

Basically, they've managed to nail every little inefficiency in the trade, and eliminate it. Then..  they can also afford to shrink their wet sales (alcohol) profit margin down to nothing, because they've rebranded the pub as a cheap family restaurant where you go with your elderly gran or your work team at lunch... Eating lots of high profit food, and drinking high profit soft drinks. "

"Tea can be a multitude of things.
In a family setting it's the evening meal you have at home with the kids - it's interchangeable with 'dinner'. It has absolutely nothing to do with the sort of tea with posh sandwiches and little cakes you can book in a hotel, or with a cream tea, which is a simialr idea but with scones and jam and clotted cream. Not something that we do everyday, very much worth doing as a holiday thing.

&gt;Just about every british tv show I've seen has a plot point of people coming into a pub that isn't their pub and everyone stares at them or the surly bartender refuses service. 

It's a trope, it's a visual shorthand for 'stranger in town', it's not a documentary.

&gt;How do I know what to do in a pub?

Go to the bar, order a drink, ask if they serve food, of they say yes, and it sounds like nice food, order some food.

&gt;Should I even care about going to a pub?

Yes, go to pubs, of course go to pubs.
"
"&gt; I would say that even the most ardent capitalist can see how the nationalisation of Rolls-Royce was beneficial to the country and taxpayers.

The problem is that this is a case of *we know that now*. What if the RB211 engine had been a flop? What if the government was blowing taxpayers' money on bad investments? This is, sadly, what the steel industry in the UK was. Even if the government had stepped in to save it, how long would that have realistically lasted? Should the government endlessly finance an industry simply to keep jobs and infrastructure; resources that could be directed elsewhere? 

Yes, in certain circumstances nationalisation, or, preferably, limited bail-out loans, should be used, but there should be clear rules about when and how this should occur, and, for the vast majority of industries, long term nationalisation is a bad thing in developed economies."

Being overtaken. If a driver is trying to overtake you, maintain a steady course and speed, slowing down if necessary to let the vehicle pass. Never obstruct drivers who wish to pass. Speeding up or driving unpredictably while someone is overtaking you is dangerous. Drop back to maintain a two-second gap if someone overtakes and pulls into the gap in front of you."
"My nearest near death experience happened this way - still get the shivers thinking about it. Picture the scene: dead straight road with one lane in each direction running across a very broad gentle valley, speed limit 60 - I can see every part of the road for about two miles ahead to the point where the road crests the next ridgeline. I'm on work duty and in a hurry but I've been stick behind some git doing about 40 for the last 10 miles or so.

This is a perfect overtaking opportunity, so I go for it. As I pull out a car coming the other way crests the ridge about 2 miles ahead. No problem, loads of space. As I come abeam said git, he starts to accelerate. I'm in a crappy little work Corsa or similar and giving it everything it's got. At 70 he's right beside me and I assume he just accelerating because it's a good stretch of road so I keep going for it. At about 100 crappy little car has nothing left to give, it's way too fast for me (under normal circumstances I never break the speed limit),  and oncoming car is getting a little proximate so I call chicken and ease off to tuck in behind. But as I decelerate so does he. From just easing off now I'm braking and he's still right beside me. Oncoming car is now getting really f-in close and flashing his headlights. I brake harder and harder and he's right there, to the point where the wheels lock up. I remember looking in the rearview and seeing a waft of tyre smoke behind me. Suffice to say that eventually I managed to get back into the left but we're down to about 20mph. So this f-r went from 40 up to 100 and back down to 20, basically to try and kill me and the oncoming driver. Once I'm back in he accelerates away while I pull onto the verge to try and get my heartrate under control. For several long seconds I thought my number was up, and the adrenaline feeling was physically sickening. I'd love to meet the guy to facilitate a thorough debrief on the events, but the last I saw was him pulling away probably back to 40mph with a hilarious story to tell his mates. Genuinely terrifying."

"And the reason trickle down won't ever work is that rich people just don't spend as much as poor people. Rich people might have a lot of money to spend, but actually tend to save more - $1m in the hands of 1 rich person won't get spent, but that $1m in the hands of 1000 poorer people, would ALL get spent. So trickle up actually works better because of that. "

"I work for NHS 111, the UK's medical advice helpline. In my experience it's fairly common for people with babies and very young children to have a thermometer in the house. From our point of view as a triage service, however, you've either got a fever or you haven't, the actual measurement isn't something we usually take into account.

Internet is good, mobile phone service is good, public services are good, roads are good (except there's lots of traffic), but you'd never think it because we love to complain about absolutely everything despite us having a very good quality of life generally speaking. 

Bear in mind that in cities and down south, people are less receptive to strangers talking to them even to ask directions, it's unusual.

"I made a few posts in the Thatcher thread last week, so can only repeat what I said there - the economic arguments for nationalisation are strong but my experiences of British rail were awful.

I used the trains a lot in the 80s as my family didn't drive at the time.  My dad also did a fair length commute to London.  Basically the trains were ancient but it was the staff and service I really hated.  No one seemed to care or want to help or even give you basic information as to what was going on.

Everyone who has worked in the public sector will reluctantly admit they know a fair bit of dead wood - people there for the pension and holidays and who do just enough not to get fired.  Well, British Rail seemed to exclusively employ them.

I should add I think a lot of the technical and engineering expertise was better then, but of course you never saw that (and even if safety was better reliability wasn't.  This was the era of delays from ""leaves on the line"" and the classic ""wrong type of snow"".)"

"It really depends on what your preconceptions of uni are as to whether it'll match them.

Studying is more self driven than in school and sixth/college. Those who put more effort in are more likely to be rewarded than school.

You'll have some people who know how to live on their own, and others that just think they do. Some people you'll be surprised they could get into your uni, some you'll be suprised didn't go for a higher-ranked one.

There are people who'll go wild, skip lectures, have constant parties and live a hungover life, which is mostly ok for first year as grades don't matter unless you're getting a placement, and you only need that 40%. There are others who'll work hard from day 1.

Uni will offer you a bigger social pool than ever before; in first year I was most involved with the drinking/party clubs, in final year I was representing the unis running team and an Esports team. As you can imagine, those groups didn't have much overlap with another and were full of completely different people. I didn't go to a big uni but there was still a stupid amount of diversity in the people and the activities.

"Some, possibly not all.

It's hard to untangle the politics from the economics.

A lot of things that went on in British nationalised industries won the Tories elections for decades.  Famous examples included the car industry, with Rover and others under government ownership releasing competing models at the same time.  Not only did they waste effort designing similar cars in parallel, the end results still managed to be light years behind foreign cars.  Inefficient, duplicating work slow and basically useless.

But...

Other things that were privatised were natural monopolies (utilities, rail), where the economic argument for private ownership is weak.

Other things were done specifically to curtail union power.  Whilst no one enjoyed the 3-day week, and blackouts caused by unions in the 70's, in these days of zero hours and the gig economy, did it go too far?

Finally, whilst some industries probably had to go, like coal, the way it was done was not exactly sympathetic.  Huge amounts of money were then wasted anyway in unemployment benefit and ""regeneration"" schemes (something I have first hand experience of, but that's another post) to try and rescue areas that had all their industry ripped out.

So yes, some of what Thatcher did I would argue had to happen.  Some made perfect sense.  Some was necessary, but had a political side.  And some of her privatisations didn't make much sense at all, except politically."

The problem is that in such a system the business owners have far too much power, and far too big a share of the profits.
