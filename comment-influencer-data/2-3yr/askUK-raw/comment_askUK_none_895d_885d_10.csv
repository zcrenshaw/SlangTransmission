As you wrote 'What should I make them buy me?' and not saying thankyou to the person who wrote you a extensive list.... perhaps a book about manners may be a good gift. 
"I feel that he's squandered a real opportunity in the last 12 months to be the voice of the opposition. I don't doubt his standing as a good man, but I doubt his ability to be a great politician and a force for change."
How's your gag reflex?
Honestly that sounds quite pathetic.
"...of meat.

Meat is cut from the animal, typically, at the joint of bones, and so each of the resulting pieces tends to be referred to as a joint of meat, or a cut of meat. "
"&gt;People of the UK, what do you do with your under 2 year olds?

I like mine grilled"
"If I ask my friend for a vegan meal and he serves leftover pork pie, do I still say thank you? It's not that I didn't like the answer, it was an answer to a question I didn't ask, that he didn't write."
Identify something you own that you can get £400 for. Sell it for £400.
"This confused the fuck out of me as a child. The Daily Mail had a column called ""A Question of Scruples"". Every week they asked a celebrity questions about their moral approach to things. One of the questions was, ""If a joint was being passed round at a party, would you partake?"" I didn't know anything about cannabis and could only imagine a roast beef being handed from person to person, which made very little sense."
Definitely a message from a spirit. Gin maybe. 
"For you, freedom of movement may be a plus - but for most people as they go through their late 20s and into their 30s, they establish family and career in a specific area and don't want freedom of movement anymore. Instead they want security, financial and retirement prospects. Who wants the hassle of having to find new places to rent, pay bonds and agency fees every few years if your landlord decides to sell up? 

For me, I want to put up shelves and a garden shed and make the attic into a spare bedroom. I want the freedom to do what I want with my property and know that I can live here until I decide to move - not always be wondering if the landlord is going to give me notice or decide to sell up. I want improvements to improve the price of something I own - not to pad someone elses mortgage. I want to have pets without hassle and feel secure in the knowledge that my son will grow up in a stable location without having to change schools or make new friends unless we make the decision to move. If you live in rented - that decision can be made for you, so you have loss of control.

There is a big difference between attitudes of someone single without a family in their 20s looking for freedom, and someone with kids and a career in a specific location looking for security."
"Those aren't insulting, they are just cringey and irritating. "
Manners cost nothing mate. 
"Hahaha, this is one of the best things I've read in a while. Tell your uncle that he is both a legend and a bastard."
"It's one informal way of saying ""thanks"". I don't keep a log or tally of every time I say the word."
"Why not do a blind taste test for yourself?  Buy a small box of each, get someone to make 3 mugs of tea, one of each type but don't tell you which is which.  See which one you prefer.

Is the liver deep fried?
Petrol station manager here. Trading standards. Rules on selling fuel are very strict. If they're selling standard grade as premium they're in a lot of trouble. Might be worth finding out who their supplier is and telling them too.
"The Sun and Daily Mail are shit.

No papers here are without bias. The Guardian and Independent are left of centre, The Telegraph and Times are right of centre. I would read a mix of these for an overall picture. 

"
I have no idea who to vote for currently. I feel like nobody properly represents my views. 
No Such Thing As A Fish.
The rules about TV were originally imposed when it was just the BBC around. They're a public service broadcaster and so have to fairly represent the interests of Britain as a whole. No such thing with newspapers. 
"I'd be surprised if they get you anything you ungrateful
cunt"
I would believe it if the convictions included speeding offences and such. I have a conviction for pissing in the street and paid the fine but does that mean I should consider myself as someone with a criminal record?
"Standard response to this type of sales bollocks is ""are you saying the other stuff is a waste of money? Why isn't this stuff given as standard if it's the only thing I should be having?"""
"You didn't say ""thank you"".

 It's just an acknowledgement, even if you don't like OP's list it's common courtesy to say thanks. "

Embarrassment?
"1) An Umbrella from the James Smith &amp; Sons
A short walk from Tottenham Court Road and Holborn tube stations, there is a shop that sells only umbrellas and walking sticks. James Smith and Sons first opened in 1830 and the original Victorian shop front remains largely untouched.

Everyone knows British weather is bad, so it’s hardly surprising that there is a shop dedicated to umbrellas, but did you know that, to this day, they make most of their umbrellas in the workshop below ground level? This shop is a London institution and hands-down the best place to purchase an umbrella or walking stick in the city.

2) Tea from Fortnum &amp; Mason
OK, so there are a a few places across the globe that stock Fortnum &amp; Mason’s tea, but nothing comes close to visiting their London store. Situated on Piccadilly, a stone’s throw from Piccadilly Circus, the shop has a wonderful clock that chimes every 15 minutes and again on the hour with an intricate display – the interior is just as impressive. Taking afternoon tea in Fortnum &amp; Mason is one of the ‘must-do’ things in the city, but if you don’t have the time, pick up a selection of their teas from the department store to take home with you.

3) An Oyster Card
Something you will probably need to get around the city anyway, an oyster card is something unique to London and a wonderful souvenir to remind you of your time here.

4) Anything from Ben’s House
This quaint little shop near Warren Street tube station only sells things that have been brewed, crafted, created or made in London. Here you can buy beer, wine, groceries, cheese, cured meats, homewares and magazines, all of which have been sourced from the city of London.

5) A cup of Monmouth Coffee
That Monmouth Coffee is the best in London is a pretty much accepted fact among Londoners. There is always a queue outside their shops, which are situated in Borough (at the edge of foodie haven Borough market),  Bermondsey and Covent Garden (where their shop has stood since 1978). You might be forgiven for thinking that you could pick up a cup of Monmouth Coffee in Monmouth itself (a town in Wales), but you would be wrong – you can only get it in London.

6) M&amp;Ms from M&amp;Ms World
It might not be the only one in the world but London’s M&amp;Ms World is the only one in Europe, and one of only five in the world (three of which are in the US). Inside you can buy an endless range of M&amp;Ms merchandise, ranging from soft toys to jewellery and bedding. You can also buy personalised M&amp;Ms to impress all your fellow chocolate lovers.

7) A Houses of Commons Notebook
The Houses of Parliament shop sells lots of things branded with the stamp of the UK government, and although they do have an online shop, we think it adds a certain element of authenticity if you actually visit the shop itself, where you can buy branded packs of playing cards and even a hip flask! The shop is opposite Big Ben, just around the corner from Westminster tube station.

8) A Hat from Lock &amp; Co
Established in 1786, Lock &amp; Co is the oldest hat shop in the world. A hat from here is so much more than a head warmer – it’s a piece of history! Lord Nelson ordered his signature hat from here, Oscar Wilde bought a fedora, Winston Churchill wore a Lock hat on his wedding day and Charlie Chaplin himself bought hats from here. Lock &amp; Co also lay claim to  creating the very first ‘coke’ or bowler hat in 1849.

9) Fabric from Liberty London
Liberty Department Store is a London institution. Originally opening in 1875, it is famous for its fashion, interiors and luxury goods, and above all, it’s in-house range of fabrics and textiles. Liberty have a range of classic designs as well as new ranges each season and are known the world over for their fashion-forward patterns and excellent standard of quality.

Edit: its about a 3-4 hour journey to Swansea so it might not be ideal to travel that far to get something you could probably easily get on eBay "
I know 4 people. And none of us have a criminal record. So no. 
Space.  Our houses tend to me a bit on the pokey side.  Many used to have outside toilets in sheds and have had bathrooms squeezed inside by converting the smallest bedroom or making existing rooms smaller to squeeze indoor facilities in somewhere.
"Didn't really do enough during the brexit campaigns, he almost seemed non existant. Plus he was elected because he's a MAN OF THE PEOPLE but hasn't really done much to live up to that"
"That's got to be one for the ""weirdest questions asked on the sub"" list.

Other than ambergris, and a few countries who eat them, I know of no value in whales, but I should leave answering to the subs many whale experts...

In the center of cities themselves it's exceedingly rare due to space constraints. In the suburbs it's fairly common
I like how you've put Scotland as if it's a town/city. Where are you going in Scotland?
"It used to be a fairly well respected print publication. Broadly left leaning, but known for good and worthy investigative journalism. 

But it wasn't making money. It went online only, save for a small print edition summarising the news over twenty or so pages. Then the Indy and the I (the print one) were sold separately and had different owners. 

I don't trust the independent anymore. It has terrible clickbait headlines, and the fact checking seems barely there. I've seen so many articles that have been rushed out where other outlets passed, or they were quickly debunked. A shadow of its former self. 

Its changes seem to be targeting wider audiences which is probably why it is more known internationally. But it used to be a lot better for sure. "
"It's difficult to put your finger on exactly what make him incredibly unlikable but I will try. He is stubborn, aloof, lacking charisma definitely. Also he has lofty ideas that most suspect wouldn't work when faced with reality. He seems to double down into stupidly rather than compromise. He has a complete lack of pragmatism you would want in an effective leader. Think left wing Donald Trump, mixed with the uncanny way of making people hate for no proper reason that hillery had"
"You do indeed have a criminal record, what you did is a crime and you were convicted of it.  

The conviction may be spent depending on how long ago it was and there are other rules governing crimes commited as a child. "
"As a sort of floating Tory voter (centre right, but Remain) I don't hate him, but I am pretty disgusted by him.

To begin with he was a fun joke.  The man who would guarantee us X more years of Tory rule.  The problem is, what we are getting is *uncontrolled* Tory rule.  We have no opposition, *because of Corbyn*.  The Tories can do almost anything, *because of Corbyn*.

As useless as Miliband was, Cameron at least gave him the respect to keep his house in order.  Well, Theresa isn't even bothering.  She is picking off the one political enemy she usually can't reach - the hard right UKIP crowd - even though it means dragging the country into the shit.

The country needs an opposition, and Corbyn is denying us it.  

The one good thing about this farce of an election is Labour might stop running off the cliff edge and sort their shit out for 2022 instead of 2025."
I think the word you're looking for is *thanks*
"Maybe poorly told. The seminal version attributed to Tommy Cooper was ""Apparently, 1 in 5 people in the world are Chinese. And there are 5 people in my family, so it must be one of them. It's either my mum or my dad. Or my older brother Colin. Or my younger brother Ho-Chau-Chou. But I think it's Colin."""

"Can you help me understand what I did wrong here, and why?"
I'm so curious about a brie dildo.
I would love a party that had roast beef being passed around. Sounds great.
"He hasn't been as vocal as he could have been, definitely.  But it's hard to focus on being an effective opposition when you're fighting off your own party every 5 minutes.

Plus, the media seem reluctant to publicise anything positive about the guy, so even when he DOES make an effective showing in PMQ or similar, we don't really hear about it.

I think his biggest strength is also his biggest weakness - he sticks to his principles.  When that principle is popular or people can relate to it (even if they don't agree) they admire him for it.  But if people don't agree with that principle he becomes a guy who won't be persuaded away from his line in the sand. And some of his lines are not very palatable for a lot of the electorate."
"The circumstances were kind of in his favour. He supposedly wasn't aware of exactly what was happening and when it was revealed, he owned up to it, paid all taxes owed and publicly admitted he was totally to blame. 

Did you see the episode of 8 out of 10 cats after it was revealed?"
