3 minutes past seven here.  I still trust him more than any other bastard currently wanting to represent us.
"* Flat Roof

* good selection of beers on offer, i.e. Carling, Carlsberg, Stella

* carpets that feel like your feet are attached to with Velcro.

* loads of kids

It would be called ""the moon under a stream of hot horse piss"" pure bliss. :) :')"
"yeah, if they say ""Don't bring anything"" that usually means don't bring any food so you should take some beers or whatever you prefer to drink."
The teachers knew how to do their job. Gove thought he knew better than the teachers on how to teach kids.
"There's nothing wrong with having a romantic something or other with someone who's under sixteen, as long as nothing sexual happens. So you could hold hands I guess? 

Sadly it would be illegal to swap sexual pictures of each other until you're both eighteen, but once the other party is sixteen you're free to *do* what you like. You're not going to get in trouble for just talking and having feelings though. 

It's so sad that someone has to even ask these questions, and that the answer is complicated. "
"Not as Labour supporter by any means, but I regard him as principled, idealistic, and painfully incapable of leadership.  He's like that nice well-meaning Geography teacher who can't control the class. Heart's in the right place, but..."
"He's the guy that talks sense, does the right thing, but gets absolutely nowhere in a world where banter and bravado mean more than integrity."
"If we do trigger article 50 and actually make plans to leave, it will solidify my plan to move to Israel. If I am going to live in a country that makes reactionary, right wing policy that seems grounded or largely influenced by xenophobia, I think I'd rather it be in a mediterranean climate where I can live on the beach and meet other Jewish lesbians."
"When in charge of education Gove seemed to have an agenda to challenge the professional status of teachers by changing teacher training from a process that involves theory and classroom training, to a process that was purely 'on the job' training, by encouraging academies and free schools to employ 'unqualified' teachers, by chucking hundreds of millions of pounds into support for marginal free schools ( including tens of millions into a free school run by a journalist friend and supporter Toby Young of the Telegraph), by having his SPADS abuse any teachers organisation that criticised him as ""marxists""....

There are quite a lot of reasons.  He saw education as a battlefield for his ideological war, and he created chaos in a public service that needs stability and long term planning."
"""Noo-gah""."
"Can I just say, '/s' can fuck right off. Every single time I see this I have to assume the person typing it is a complete imbecile. That comment was clearly sarcasm, it's not subtle or difficult to identify at all. I see it on British subreddits all the time now, do people really need markers to show where sarcasm is? Fucking hell."
I've decided to get some of that wallpaper that looks like a bookcase full of old books. It'll look nice on the wall in the under-stairs cupboard.  And I'm doing my hair a bit differently too.
"There are no legal risks of talking to a 15 year old. 

Is there something further you need to explain?"
An umbrella 
"He is terrible at politics. My opinion hasn't changed since he was elected. MPs are being a bit cunty but I can't blame them as I agree he is unelectable.

As for his actual political views, some are good, but the Falklands and nuclear deterrent comments are unforgivable IMO."
"Hold on here. Your parents have missed payments on the mortgage (I assume that's what they missed?) And they're pissed because you took out a phone contract? That's bizarre.

Secondly.. House prices are NOT affected by credit scores. And even if this was the case, there is no link between address and score in that way.. It's all in your name, and yours alone.

Thirdly, I hope you didn't get an extortionate (as most people do) contract, but if you keep up with payments then it will help your credit score, which will help you in the longer term."
"It's almost like instead of trying to contain a classroom of children, he's trying to treat the electorate like a group of adults having discourse."
"I hope you get to move out of there and get your own space. You don't deserve their rancid behaviour towards you.

Well done on getting accepted to uni."
I am particularly unhappy with the culture that led to a 'Leave' vote.  My partner and I are considering emigration within the next five years.
"Loud music. If I can't have a chat, what's the point in being in a pub? "
I think they were just to make the 80s even more grim. 
"It's definitely illegal!  Domestic cats are protected under law.

Former immigration officer here. I'm pretty sure you won't have a problem. We are trained to look at things such as the height of your ears in relation to your nose etc. Things that match your photo but won't really change with age. 
By bullshitting.
"He ignored the experts and teachers in favour of a ""School should be like it was back in my day!"" attitude. His changes were all the kind of thing that looks good in a Telegraph column, but doesn't work out well in real life. It was the Dunning Kreuger effect in action, basically. "
That's a typo.
"Not meant to be insulting, but have you tried some of the news sources for younger ages, such as http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround"
"Clearly opposite of everyone else commenting... no.

Maybe I'm a fool, but nothing is gong to change so dramatically that people need to leave the country. We'll negotiate a deal almost the same as being in the EU, maybe with one or two caveats. As immigration was such an issue, we might take less (note less, not none / no) Europeans, but I don't think we'll suddenly become an American-esque green card country.

I understand there's a lot of anger in people, especially those who voted remain, but I'd love to see this thread resurrected in 10 years and see who really did leave. Once the anger subsides (maybe 6 months) it will all go back to normal."
"I used to run a shop that sold, among other things, teapots. You could have all the fancy teapots you liked, be it china, steel or carbon fibre. The only thing the old ladies coming in for a new pot wanted to know was...

Does it drip.

They'd make us fill it up with water and test-pour it to see if it dripped when they put it down. It could be a Â£70 Le Crueset teapot in cast iron, but if a molecule of water dripped off that spout... it might as well be made of chocolate.

Choose wisely."
Thank goodness Brexit passed. Your hair was looking awful before.
"Either way, make sure its short and stout"
I know very little about cruises as well so could be wrong. But doesn't the fact that Paris is about 80 miles inland mean a cruise ship would probably struggle to get there?
"A bottle of (decent) wine is never refused.  Nor a pack of (again, decent) beer.  You'll get a ""Oh! You shouldn't have!"" and they'll be gratefully guzzled.

If you have specific dietary requirements (vegetarian, gluten free, nut allergy, etc) let the host know that you'll be bringing a few things that you can eat.

But, at all the BBQs I've been to - the host provides salads, snacks, and drinks.

Worst case scenario, once you arrive offer to pop to the local shops to pick up anything that's missing."
"Genetically, /u/BFG_5000 has more genes in common with crabs than they do with you and me. Now that is scientific fact. There's no real evidence for it, but it is scientific fact."

"If you're making porridge with butter just go the whole hog, slap it in the oven and call it a flapjack."
"The closest thing you have to compare with is Texas. Consider the sorts of culture and identity issues there that drives the secessionist movement. Scotland is *very* different in the sorts of culture, but a large part of it is an identity thing.

The next part is socio-political norms. Here you might want to consider the contrast between the ""blue-states"" and ""red-states"". Scotland has developed a rather different political culture to a lot of England, particularly over the past 30 years. (To say Scotland is left-wing is a gross simplification, but it's got a more functionalist approach, so even the Conservatives and right wing of the SNP have a different approach to their peers in England.)

The thing you don't have to compare with in the US is the deep history that we live with daily. Many people daily walk past buildings that predate the union, they are surrounded by place names steeped in history of battles and other events, their surnames are the same as those who were prominent 400 years ago. That gives a deep support to ideas of identity.

It's partly why people get upset by the Americans claiming to be ""Scottish"" or ""Irish"", you can't be both American and Scottish, and you can't be both Scottish and English. The concept of identity and nation doesn't allow for it. Being both Scottish and British is contentious. It works for some people, for others it triggers the same distaste as the other combinations."
"It's a BBBQ.

The extra B is for BYOBB."
June 16th.  MP Jo Cox was murdered.
butter with fucking porridge?
"It's empty apart from me.  It serves a brilliant Sunday roast with at least four Yorkshire puddings. 

It's vital that I'm the only one there "
