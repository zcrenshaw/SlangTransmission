"Bad teeth. They might not be white or straight, but they are rarely bad. Indeed I think I read an NHS report which said we have the lowest cavities in Europe. "
"They microwave, boil in the bag, deep fry and keep popular stuff on hot plates. It won't kill you and it's quality controlled. Not the best option but not the worst."
"Because the old, crappy houses have been knocked down. "
"You're not going because it something you agree with, you're going to show support to your cousin and their family, to whom it's clearly important. 

Being an adult is about sucking it up and knowing when to stamp your feet and when you get on with it - their child's special day isn't the time to start ripping apart someone's religious beliefs. 

Plus you might get free cake. "
"Do it.

If you want to do something like this, just do it.

I've had a few man friends give me cards with notes. You know, stuff that was important like the above. They meant a lot to me."
"No, of course not. "
"Check ups are more common among older people or those with chronic conditions. It's quite unnecessary to do so as a young fit person. 

&gt;It seems that in the USA there is more of an emphasis on prevention of illness compared to the UK, where the focus of healthcare is primarily on curative treatment.

Doctors in America make a fortune from people going to visit for no reason. In the UK the NHS loses out if people go to the doctor for no reason.

&gt;Are there any specific cultural reasons for the differences in the American approach to healthcare compared to how it works in the UK?

Money and narcissism

&gt;I think if I only ever visited my doctor when I was sick, I would dread visiting them.

Why? They are there to cure you..."
"Personally, I'd just break off contact and leave it.

Sooner or later, this person will twig that only people with the same beliefs want to be around him."
"Just follow ITV2's example, buy the rights to Hot Fuzz and the Matrix Reloaded and show them alternately every other night."
"You shouldn't go.

You sound like an insufferable schmuck, and everyone else will have a much more enjoyable time without you there."
"I think it's mainly Americans who think that, and it's because theirs are fake and bleached and ridiculous. Compared with those yes, ours look bad - but it's like saying old people are ugly if they haven't had plastic surgery. "
"I actually don't know. Let's look at Wikipedia

&gt;Gary Glitter, born Paul Francis Gadd in Banbury, glam rock star and convicted paedophile.

Oh."
Another one for his personal collection!
"I spent almost 3 months finding this out for myself.
Be a proper alcoholic and find out yourself.
As they say, the chase is better than the catch. ;)"
"Honestly, our rule is that if you can't work out how to walk down a pavement without walking into people, just stay at home."
"cider. If they've got old rosie on, it's like 2.50 a pint and it'll send you to fucking space."

"Yes. Total cow. Unredeemable.


You could have given us a trigger warning for this abusive behaviour..."
Like the Inbetweeners but more tragic
"That we are patronising.

I think maybe you mean *condescending*?"
Bad food. Yes there's some crap but we have a lot of fantastic cuisines and chefs.
not again!
"Sure. Everyone should pay their fair share of taxes but it's not reasonable to expect people to voluntary pay more taxes than they're required to. If society feels like someone isn't paying their fair share, and yet that person or organisation is paying what is asked of them, then the tax code should be changed."
It's not a thing here. You just walk. With the exception of escalators in london.
Is this the greatest joke ever told?
Yes. Bought a stethoscope from a car boot sale. The pint glass trick isn't very good anyway. 
"That we all speak with 'The British Accent' as seen on American TV shows. And it is so sexy. 

Mostly repeated on reddit by those from the USA, who would be vwry confused if trying to have a conversation with someone from Liverpool or Glasgow."
They're probably getting that many complaints about damaged or undelivered stuff they have no choice.

"It depends on what level of access she has and exactly where she works.

Even if she can, viewing anybody's medical record except in the legitimate course of your duties is gross misconduct and can even be illegal."
Both.
Why would you refuse to have one though?  You're just giving yourself heaps of bother.
"This is true, the old houses still around today tend to be the best of their era, the shit ones from the old days have either fallen down or been knocked down."
"Well done for having a functional tongue, American chocolate tastes like vomit.

Have you tried the obvious places like Amazon, or looked locally for any shops in your area that import British foods? 

I was in Ft Lauderdale recently and like the in UK supermarkets have started doing sections of imported foods from the US/UK."
"Unrelated, but I was reminded of this beauty

"A 2:1 is considered the target grade for most. I have never seen any employer asking for more than a 2:1. A first is nice and obviously a fantastic achievement but certainly not necessary.

Edit: Spelling "
Everything is microwaved apart from the things that are deep fried (fish and chips onion rings etc) or cooked on the grill (steak burgers etc)
You'll probably end up on some weird fetish website now 
"Developers are trying to maximise their profits.

Land is expensive.

There is a big need for new houses too, so want to fit more into the space for that reason too.

Everyone is always trying to do stuff for less money.

Not all old houses were big, just the nice ones. ""Railway cottages"" and so forth can be pretty small.

"
"There is no walk on left or right rule, walk where you like. If people are blocking the pavement don't dart out of their way turn a shoulder and smash into them (then say 'sorry!'), arseholes shouldn't block the pavements like that anyway

I think the reason you're having problems is that you're assuming people won't move out of your way, if they're blocking the pavement they almost certainly will. "
"No, but it's pretty much impossible to get access to certain services without one. In my experience, you can't log into any online HMRC services without a phone that can receive a code, can't get access to mental health treatment because the NHS services refuse to accept your info via email/post, can't register for most services without supplying a fake number as the form won't submit with a blank field...."
"&gt; fake and bleached and ridiculou

Exactly this.

Glow in the dark teeth are *not* sexy."
Which is fine until it's urgent. Bank suspects someone is fraudulently accessing your account? Let's write a letter and wait a few days to check before freezing it.

"&gt;In the UK, is it common to only visit a doctor if you're currently unwell?

Yes.  Certain groups may have certain limited check ups only.  

It's generally agreed that yearly checkups are of poor value (economically) with minor to no significant health benefits, in some case they cause harm.

&gt;General health checks **did not reduce morbidity or mortality**, neither overall nor for cardiovascular or cancer causes, although they increased the number of new diagnoses.

"Warm beer.

Sorry it's not super chilled to the point it becomes tasteless?

Beer shouldn't be warm, but neither should it be that cold. Cellar temp is perfect."

"Yes ou degrees are generally very well respected by employers.

Because you have to be motivated and organised to achieve at the ou students are seen to come well prepared."
It would be extremely childish not to go.
I do not want to be in your gang.  
"Nice try, Jeremy."
"I think you mean reserved, unless you hang out with a lot of clerics..."
"I think this comes from the fact that 'traditional' British food is rather easy to do and not particularly 'high brow' in terms of cuisine. Fish and chips, pie and mash, bangers and mash, roasts, pasties, stews etc. As much as I love this sort of food, it's all pretty easy to make. 

This stereotype is mostly coming from the French as well, those arrogant bastards never shut the fuck up about their cuisine. "
"First, there's a little bit of language confusion we need to clear up. In British English, *hunting* normally refers to hunting with dogs, *shooting* is shooting game birds and *stalking* is shooting large game. I think American English would call all of these *hunting.*

You can still use dogs to flush and retrieve game birds during shooting (""duck hunting"") as that's specifically excepted, it's using dogs to kill quarry that's banned. The legislation is often referred to as the ""fox hunting ban"" as that seems to be the main target of it."
Definitely both
"Do you eat Toad in the Hole because it's a really pretty meal, or because it's really tasty? Some foods aren't that visually appealing, but that doesn't matter too much if they taste good. Some foods, like cake covered in fondant icing, look amazing but taste disgusting. "
I would phrase it something like: It was always good to come into work and see a friendly face when life was getting me down
They catch on quicker if they are told outright.
