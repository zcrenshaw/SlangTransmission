Keep quiet and don't make a big deal of it.
"IMO your fear is totally out of proportion for the risk. So, you might wish to seek psychological assistance - Google *IAPT* and your area, or ask at your GP surgery (receptionist should know) about IAPT."

"That's not emergency tax.

What people refer to as ""emergency tax"" just means that the employer doesn't know your tax code, so everything is taxed at the Basic Rate of 20% as the Personal Allowance will not be applied.

If she was expecting £1200 but only received £600 then something is very wrong, because those deductions are far in excess of anything accounted for by Income Tax and National Insurance.

Assuming she hasn't got access to her payslip, she needs to contact her employer and find out what they have deducted and why."
"Oh dear.

Do you mean English people or British people?

If you are studying our politics then the absolute first thing you should learn is that English and British are not the same thing, and the two words are not remotely interchangeable.

In fact confusing the two could even lead to you being physically assaulted in extreme cases."
provisional drivers license?
"I'm not pro-gun, but I understand that guns are so ingrained in US culture that it would be close to impossible to exercise a level of gun control to a degree of strictness that's even close to what we have in the UK.

Guns are tools designed with the express purpose of killing things. I do not believe that gun ownership makes people safer, it just escalates situations where conflict could have been avoided but for the presence of guns. This goes for both the average citizen and for the police."
"It's a monumental pain in the arse, particularly if you're a veggie or have some other limitation on what you can eat, as you can guarantee that everyone else will order things you can't have and still nick half of yours, so you only end up having half a meal. Having a dish that's yours, serving yourself as much as you fancy, and then saying ""would anyone like a bit of this?"" is reasonably common in the circles I move in. It's the idea of a free-for-all that doesn't go down so well, because the fastest eaters and the ones who have no compunction about piling their plate 6 inches high do better at the expense of everyone else. 

If you're that keen to try a bit of everything then why haven't you suggested we go to a place that does buffet style? Then you can have a bit of everything without stopping me from having a reasonable quantity of the one or two things I can eat."
"Me, because I'm not fucking English.

Neither are 5.3 million Scots, 3 million Welshmen and 1.8 million Northern Irishmen but you know, just carry on and grossly insult over 10 million people with one ignorant comment."
"It was me.

I am the craptain now."
"&gt; Is there a significant difference in printing quality between this and my old inkjet printer, it stopped working last year, but the scanner works.

The initial difference will be readily noticeable because the new one will print whereas the old broken one won't. This feature is quite an advantage and probably makes it all the more worth the initial outlay "
"Staines, innit?"
"Part of the problem is the era in which he was 'active'.

I was born in 1971, Jim'll Fix It was one of the most popular TV shows when I was a kid, we impersonated his mannerisms in the school playground, and wrote letters to his show wanting to meet famous people and do cool stuff.....

It was also a very naive era, no social media, no internet, you were told 'don't talk to strangers' but you were not told what those strangers might want to do, as the adults just did not talk about that sort of thing.

I remember my parents discussing Savile - my mother always used to say 'He gives me the creeps' - however hers was a lone voice in our family, my father always watched his show with me and thought he was merely an eccentric showbiz genius.  My grandmother, who worked at the BBC, worshipped the ground he walked on - and was always trying to get me his autograph, or tickets to be in the audience for his TV shows.

For many people of that era he was simply 'eccentric'.  The perverts were the dodgy old men who watched kids in playgrounds, or who flashed at young women at train stations..... Savile couldn't be one of 'them'.  He was only messing around.

But it turns out he was, and it was all too real..."
"Reschedule. A lot of families will have plans on bonfire night, especially since it falls on the weekend this year. Often many of the massive firework displays will be on the weekend before or after Guy Fawke's - but with it being on a Sat this year a lot of people will have plans to go to events."
"You'll be surprised by how nonchalant and uninterested the entire population will be. 

Also, the sarcasm will likely still blindside you even with British TV to prepare you. "

"I've never been in a fight in my life and the local bars, pubs and clubs are basically my second homes. I've actually only ever seen two fights, one involved a police horse and the other was someone being a twat to a bouncer and getting decked. Basically as long as you're not a confrontational bellend, stick to relatively busy areas, don't try to break up another fight and avoid dodgy alleys you'd have to be extremely, extremely unlucky to get into a fight, and even more exceptionally unlucky to get stabbed. Random stabbings are so, so rare in the vast majority of the country. You should be less scared of any of this than getting into a car accident or being run over any time you leave your house.

These are my experiences after going out constantly in Liverpool for 6 years anyway.

As others have said, a therapist for anxiety issues seems like a good place to start."
"Hi,
    
I hereby tender my notice of resignation from my current position as `X`.
    
I have spent `A` years with Company `B` and have truly valued my time here, however I have since found a new opportunity that I would like to explore.
    
I thank you for the skills you have taught me and wish my colleagues that remain, the best with the future.
    
My last day will by `Y`.
    
Regards,

Doesn't really matter tbh, so long as you state you are leaving and when your last day is. The rest is just fluff to keep ties in case you need references. Don't burn your bridges!

Always worth speaking to your manager about it first, then tendering the paper copy (maybe a day later). They may try and keep you, who knows that they'll offer.

Also, don't hand the resignation in unless you have a contract in front of you from the new job. You can speak to your manager about leaving tomorrow - even before the paper copy comes in."
Do I do this before or after the letter? Not sure when is the most polite time to induce a concussion
"It's legal to have sex with them. But be careful if they send you naked pictures because that counts as underage porn. So you have to make sure all sexual activity is strictly in person.

Also there's the risk that they are actually slightly younger."

"You'd be surprised actually.  
The other day I was doing my weekly shop in Tesco, and once I got to the self service and scanned everything it came to £64.34. I thought I'd try my luck, so I went up to the assistant on the tills and whispered:  
 ""I'll tell you what, I'll give you £50 for this and that will be the last we say about it?""  
I wasn't expecting it to work, but you wouldn't believe what happened next.  
I was escorted out of the building.

This. It's not worth the risk. If Grindr had been around when I was 15 I'd have been on it, so it's not outside the realms of possibility that other 15-year-olds will be too "

I think you need to get better at interpreting at when people are interested in you.

Clearly you have made these individuals feel uncomfortable.

The idea that your 'finishing' is bad is clearly absurd, as it's your encounter before this that generates interest.

Eugh.  What a crappy attitude.

"Confusing Britain and England is a big faux pas, so let's get that out of the way first.

To answer your question, politics are a contentious subject in the UK and they don't get discussed much out in public or while at work. It's not that we don't have political views, but most of us prefer to keep them to ourselves for the most part."
"There will be a very small minority that actually hate people just because of where they are from but the majority of people are not ignorant idiots basing their opinion of people on where they come from.

If the people above have flushed something down there that's caused this then there's a good chance they'll do it again not realising what's happened.
