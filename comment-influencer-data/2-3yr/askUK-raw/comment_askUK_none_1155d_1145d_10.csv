I think Grimsby must do well in this.
"Probably about the same time that they last killed an unarmed white guy.

These protests have zero relevance in the UK."
"Yeah, pretty common.  Ours is 15 minutes and one ailment.  

It's to stop your gran going in an talking for hours about her lumbago and her knees and her hearing and her veins and her hips and her arthritis and her knees (again) and her sciatica and... and taking up an hour and a half while five other people are sitting outside waiting for their appointments while she rattles on.

[Not all grans rattle on.  The value of your gran can go down as well as up.  Your gran may be at risk if you can't make the payments.]"
"Slough. (For people who don't know how it's pronounced, the ough is ow like how or now.)

Lower Slaughter. Upper Slaughter."
"You're about 5 times more likely to be struck by lightning than to die following any form of police contact in the UK. And that includes stats like drug dealers swallowing their stash, or fugitives crashing their cars/running across train tracks etc.

Its such a fucking non issue."
"Call the police. Get the kid to log times, names, places etc. Don't be afraid, people are hitting kids ffs. "
"I think you may be looking for a problem where there isn't one... Here British people are British, not black or white: British. "
Probably stop touching them both at the same time ...
"The Black Lives Matter protests in the UK are part of an interesting trend that our increasing Americanisation is having. As our media becomes more saturated with US politics, their issues are beccoming ours via cultural osmosis. The traditional struggle in the UK has always been one of class, before race, but this is beginning to change (at least perceptually). Far be it from me to say that race isn't an issue in the UK, because it absolutely is, it's just interesting the way that we're going about it because of our exposure to US culture. "
"Hull.

Somewhere between dull &amp; hell."
I don't think you can claim someone is unarmed if they are walking around with an imitation gun. It's quite understandable why the police would shoot someone with one of those. 
"I can share my experience.

Last year was the worst I've been when it came to depression. I was considering doing myself in tbh. I went to my GP and said I feel utterly hopeless and completely broke down in tears in his office. He asked me a few questions to assess me, said I seem depressed, referred me to a counselling service and prescribed me some medication. That was it really. Then it was pretty much up to me to turn up to my counselling sessions and take my medication.

They won't let anyone else know about anything you've said unless you say they can (eg. referring you to another service) or if they have reason to believe you're going to hurt yourself or someone else. You'd basically need to tell them ""I'm going to do it tonight, I won't be here tomorrow. I have a plan and this is what I'm going to do."" for them to get the police or whoever involved. I mean, I've told my GP that I cut myself the night before seeing them and that I do it fairly regularly and they've just used that to say ""Well, here's a prescription for prozac, love"" 

Don't worry, they'll try to help. But they won't try and smother you if you're reluctant."
"Congratulations on being dry for a year. If your local supermarket has bottle banks in their car park,  I'd suggest filling up a carrier bag or two each time you visit and get rid of them that way. You may feel self conscious but nobody will be watching or judging you.

Basset's and Maynard's respectively
Can't believe nobody has said Scunthorpe
"In this case, reportedly means confirmed. Even his family accepted and admitted that he did have a gun on him."
"The King of all Hipsters. You should have knelt before him, almighty ruler of all things edgy."
"What separates us isn't race but class.

God save the Queen!"
"a) not really

b) because this is a movement I associate with Americans, it makes me (even) more irritated by Americans."
"Super Hans? 

I've owned reptiles,  certainly heard nothing about it being illegal to have them with you outside. Although  doing so sounds daft as."
"Canadians have a long and distinguished history both in HM Armed Forces and as valued allies of the United Kingdom.

Which branch would you enter, out of interest?"
"The cons are that unless you're a British Citizen or have a good degree plus strong, relevant work experience in a skilled occupation then it's not going to happen.

It's exceptionally difficult to just ""move to the United Kingdom"" unless you're an EU Citizen or the above applies to you."
"Because, unlike most of Europe, in a fit of idiocy we got rid of our state-owned public transport and privatised the lot."
"She teaches at your school? You won't get in trouble but she will. You will totally fuck up her career, and there is the possibility that she will get in trouble with the police depending on how they interpret the ""position of trust"" provisions.

Don't be a dick, tell her the truth and apologise for misleading her about your age but you thought it was a harmless ""I want to seem more mature"" lie rather than ""this is going to have major consequences"" lie. Explain you understand that you're going to have to cut contact for her sake and it's nothing personal, then block her. And if you see her round school next term act like she's any other teacher in the place."
"You could *maybe* speak to your local council recycling department and arrange for a special collection but they are almost certain to charge you a fee for doing so.

Just put up with taking them to the bottle bank. Do it once every few days and they'll be gone in a week or two.  And you'll get some exercise from doing it too."

"We sometimes hear stories from travellers of a fabled fruit known as the 'pine-apple'. If such a fruit exists, I would suggest buying that for them, if you don't need to ruin yourself in order to do so."
"&gt; it's for sale on ebay so i'm assuming its legal in the UK

lol"
I just can't tell who is taking the piss out of who anymore
"That seems to be a common thing for the yanks.

If they're not getting shot, they're being attacked in the street by cardboard boxes"

"Sorry to piss on your Strawberries mate, but it's simply not going to happen. 

With all due respect to you and your wife, car sales and cooking pizzas are nowhere near skilled enough to meet visa requirements. No company is going to sponsor a visa for either of those jobs because it really is a ton of hassle for them to do so and there are about 742 million EU citizens they can tap in to without the need for visas. 

You will not be able to have a middle class existence with those two jobs in London, it's one of the most expensive cities in the world.Â 

I'm really not trying to be negative, but it really is a non-starter. "
"Well, in the case you wish to complain about a company, it is usually recommended you write a letter to as high as possible in the organisation, I guess the CEO.

There are various consumer organisations and programmes, such as Watchdog, You and Yours, Which?, that you can try.

There is the Trading Standards office of your local council.

You can alert people on social media to the flaws of Barratt homes.

You may feel it better to cut your losses and get on with your life."
A pillar of the community and well liked young father. Who just happened to be participating in the ambush of a secure vehicle carrying prisoners at the time he was shot. Skin colour: irrelevant.

"Did a suntan lotion salesman make that recommendation per chance?

No of course I dont. "
"&gt;This is causing me significant depression as well as straining relationships with friends and family

This seems like quite an overreaction to what seems to just be an unreliable person messing you around over a few evenings."
send your selve a letter every day for a week and see when you get them

"No matter what the reason or religion, this is abuse. No matter what your elders or parents tell you, it is not normal and it certainly is not legal. Please ring the police on 101 or the NSPCC/Childline. Your poor brother. :("
I think phoning an electrician would be your best bet.

"Come friendly bombs and fall on Slough!      
It isn't fit for humans now,       
There isn't grass to graze a cow.       
Swarm over, Death!      
Come, bombs and blow to smithereens      
Those air -conditioned, bright canteens,       
Tinned fruit, tinned meat, tinned milk, tinned beans,       
Tinned minds, tinned breath.      

Mess up the mess they call a town-      
A house for ninety-seven down      
And once a week a half a crown       
For twenty years.      

And get that man with double chin      
Who'll always cheat and always win,       
Who washes his repulsive skin       
In women's tears:      

And smash his desk of polished oak      
And smash his hands so used to stroke      
And stop his boring dirty joke      
And make him yell.      

But spare the bald young clerks who add      
The profits of the stinking cad;      
It's not their fault that they are mad,       
They've tasted Hell.      

It's not their fault they do not know       
The birdsong from the radio,       
It's not their fault they often go       
To Maidenhead      

And talk of sport and makes of cars      
In various bogus-Tudor bars       
And daren't look up and see the stars       
But belch instead.             

In labour-saving homes, with care      
Their wives frizz out peroxide hair      
And dry it in synthetic air      
And paint their nails.      

Come, friendly bombs and fall on Slough      
To get it ready for the plough.      
The cabbages are coming now;      
The earth exhales.

"Why am I not surprised that these studies make no mention of the crime rates by race? If population X commits the majority of the crimes, a higher rate of arrests or stop &amp; searches is to be expected. If the studies don't look at this information, their claims have no merits. "
