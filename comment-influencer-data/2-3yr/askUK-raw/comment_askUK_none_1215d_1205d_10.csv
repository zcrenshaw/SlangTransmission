"If true, this is brilliant. Just fade out the lie. Start saying you're getting rusty, can't remember some words, forgetting it etc. Either that, or learn Chinese."
"Look mate, and I'm sorry to be harsh, but you need to suck it up and either ming bing or shee chow"
Yup only choice is to learn Chinese.

"Indeed.

It's a good job the OP picked a language which English speakers find easy to pick up, with the bonus of a culture so very similar to western Europe. It'll be a piece of piss.

Does the OP even know if they speak Mandarin or Cantonese?!"
"Who also lied on their resume that they speak Chinese and now both thinks one or the other speaks Chinese and soon they start to ""learn"" each others fake words and then end up creating their own language."
"You could say that you spoke to a friend you made there recently and he let you down gently by telling you that you had alright vocabulary but were almost incoherent - I.e. You were sure you were fluent, but you were shit and now you're rusty on top of that!"
"There was a similar situation at my previous place of employ. A guy claimed to be able to speak fluent Japanese when he was hired. Same jig as you. Except those people would then come to me (I do in fact speak Japanese fluently) and tell me these great new words that Bob taught them. (This differed from my own approach where when asked about how to say this or that, I would tell people that if they were genuinely interested in the language that they should take proper lessons.

I can't tell you how many times I fought back my laughter and puzzled expressions, but I let the rouse continue and feigned amazement. After all, I was getting some laughs out of it. Then one day Bob and I run into each other at lunch (up until then, I think Bob made it a point to avoid any interaction with me whatsoever). At this point, delighted at this prosperous union of two supposedly fluent Japanese speakers. Fellow colleagues pushed us to have a conversation in Japanese. So we smiled, did the usual greeting. ""Konichiwa"" he said. ""Hai, Konichiwa."" I responded. And then I just stared at him as he started to sweat bullets. I gave him the wide eyed ""go on, say something"" look. And he just muttered a few clickity-clackity vowels in a fashion that might have to an unfamiliar ear passed as Japanese. I of course returned the gesture and made up some clickity clackity noises too. And we carried on for the next minute clicking and clacking at each other with made up faces.

All of this, to everyone's delight. And I could see Bob was now immensely relieved that he was allowed to save face, and that I wasn't out to destroy him. Later on, he thanked me privately and we went out for drinks and had a mighty good laugh.

It has been years since we both parted ways with our previous employer, yet Bob and I still remain friends and laugh about that time we first met."
This was my first thought as well. Nobody goes around talking about how cool it is that someone knows another language anymore. It's way too common.
"&gt; so I've just been making random noises like 'ming bing' and 'shee chow' and similar 

&gt; People have been walking around the office making gibberish sounds that are the words I've 'taught' them.

I haven't laughed this much in ages. Thanks OP.

Or end up in the ding dung.
this needs to be a movie.
I'm at white guy who speak pretty fair conversational Chinese and people at my work look at me in awe when I speak Chinese. I work with construction workers though so it might not be hard to impress them. 
"Hey, you can sit next to Bob! He speaks your language!"
"I've been trying  but obviously it's hard to pretend you've forgotten everything from saying you're fluent.

I have tried learning it in a sort of mini-breakdown-panic week but it's bloody difficult and there's absolutely no chance of doing it, way over my head."
Until they employ a Chinese man.
Turns out that the new guy is Japanese...
I can't believe that not a single person has looked any of the words up and immediately realised that OP is full of shit. I reckon they all already know how full of shit he is and are now just messing with him.
"On the other hand, at least it's less likely that people will realise he's chatting shit."
只是告诉他们滚开，并管闲事。如果不工作，然后粉碎了这个地方。希望这可以帮助。
"It's a pretty bad Chinese translation but it says: If you can read this, then you know I don't speak Chinese, but I need to because of a lie I said once. If you speak Chinese to me, I will say a communist slogan/racist comment(?) back to you. Please pretend to understand, for it is definitely real. I will give you reddit gold if you do. 

"
"OP could play off that whilst he thought he had learned fluent Chinese, what he'd actually been learning was a hodge-podge of Cantonese, Mandarin, Hakka etc. It comes across as an honest mistake, he thought he was learning Chinese but actually learnt bits of the various types of Chinese. 'I'm so embarrassed, I didn't realise I was learning different varieties' or something similar thrown about in the lunch room could easily absolve him of guilt."
"Just say one day ""hey guess what guys - I fooled ya! I don't speak Chinese! You've been repeating gibberish! LOL! Joke is on YOU GUYS. You must feel so silly right now hey?"""
"Put a sign up with 

""如果你可以看到这一点，我不会说中国话，但我需要，因为一个谎言，我告诉帮助。能否请你说中国话给我，我会让种族主义的声音回你。请假装你明白，它是真实的。请。我给你黄金在Reddit上。"" written on. One day a random Chinese speaker will either save you or destroy you."
"What the hell am I gonna do Jerry!? I don't know Chinese!

Later in the episode a Chinese person visits the place of work and George pretends *they're* faking"
"I'm fucking dying at ""ming bing"" "
"I know, right. But not in the United Kingdom."
George Costanza?
Yeah but 0.4 billion of them are at Disney at any one time
"Hold my shee chow, I'm going ming ding!"
You're probably going to have to learn Chinese mate. Bit of a nightmare that.

"Which, unbelievably, works.  George arranged it so that Jerry was there to corroborate his story that this Chinese person was a notorious liar, and possibly just ""Mexican, or something"".

Jerry, uncomfortable with the lie, makes do with simply not contradicting George.  The members of the office are unconvinced, and George begins with the arm-flailing and shouting.  Things look grim until George points out the Urban Sombrero in the backseat of the Chinese person's car with a smug ""ah-ha!"".  Accusations fly and the office members tsk at the visitor's disgraceful lie.

Everyone in the office buys it. Right up until the point when Kramer bursts into George's office to track down the woman who sold him some stinky Chinese hair removal cream over the phone which gave him a rash, and ruined his latest scheme: to join the olympic synchronized swimming team.

Kramer is oblivious to George's increasingly desperate gestures and body language, and proceeds to have a shouting match with said Chinese person in Mandarin.  The Boss realizes George's deception.  George is fired."

"Oh, you mean like top of /r/bestof, on the frontpage?

Yeah, this dude is boned."
"If you're going to go with this lie make sure you have a Singaporean or Malaysian chinese friend, this is because our Chinese culture incorporates multiple dialects (predominantly Hokkien and Cantonese, and some even have a 3rd dialect)

For instance:
Mandarin : cao ni lao ma        
Cantonese : diu lei lo mou      
Hokkien : kan ni ne na bu      

all mean the same but sound completely different"
I would never lie about speaking Japanese bc of all the weeaboos learning it that will question you
"Possibly. However, with the various languages within the 'Chinese' umbrella, the myriad option for translation they might find, and the complications of scripts and of Chinese's tonal inflections, they would have no way of knowing that they'd not just found a different one."
"
If this goes viral you are in a heap of trouble."
Ming bing.
"Speaking any Chinese language is very rare, although less so now than in the past. It's still nowhere near as common as pretty much any European language."
"Tell them all that you played one of the kids in Jurassic Park (make sure to pick the one that corresponds to your gender). Soon they'll all be asking questions about that instead, as it's a far more interesting topic than Mandarin vocabulary. Also, unlike Chinese geography, your stories about your antics on the set will be pretty much impossible to disprove! Your colleagues might be able to use Wikipedia to point out that the Great Wall isn't really in Beijing, but they'll never be able to prove that Jeff Goldblum didn't used to irritate you by eating all the cucumber sandwiches off the catering trolley every day during filming."
"Don't worry about it mate, I would've bought and demolished that discounted lemon tart if you hadn't.

tl;dr: No."

"It's really a damn shame you decided to go out for a bike ride this beautiful holiday weekend, only to have some fool's dog run out in front of you and cause you to go over your handlebars.

Luckily you were wearing a helmet, but you still got a concussion and it appears to have caused some lingering headaches and affected your ability to speak Chinese.

Hopefully your colleagues will be sympathetic to your injury and not bring it up too often."
"'cao ni lao ma' (草你老吗) is a chengyu, a 4-letter traditional Chinese saying that literally says 'grass (草) you (你) venerable-one (老) question-particle (吗)'. 

It can be loosely translated to 'teacher, the earth you walk on deserves respect', but is used more of as a respectful greeting to any elder really."
"People were much more tight-fisted than usual.

We were scrimping every night, every day!  I had a particularly good scrimp in a charity shop I do recall.

We became hot, sweaty and were all really feeling the pinch.

At the end of the day, we all had to tighten our belts."

"It's either that, or he's taking the piss out of *us* with the entire fabrication.

But if it *is* legit, then given he's dense enough to lie in such a fashion (habitually, if ""Out of all the lies on my CV"" is anything to go by) I'd wager he'd be dense enough to not detect when they're taking the piss out of him too."
"吗 (ma) means question.

妈 (ma) means mother.

"Going to give an example of what /r/Belgravian said. I used to be fluent, speaking wise, in Swedish, couldn't read or write it though. Within a few months of not being around my Swedish friends everyday I was rusty, a year later I can just about count to 10 and swear."
