"If you recognise that your view of British culture and another Brit's view of British culture are different, then you have to conclude that there is no such thing as objective British culture. And if there is no such thing as objective British culture, then your question is somewhat moot."
"Just don't make jokes about the Incident. In fact, don't talk about it at all."
"Not quite a joke, but I remember when I was a teenager I never understood why in The Simpsons they made references to ""doing their taxes"" or why they paid to go to the hospital."
"*Driving* licence.

I'm not letting the Yanks take that one from us like they did with ""nail varnish""."
"I recall reading an american newspaper review of Shaun of the Dead that talked about how good it was that they decided not to set it in London, even though it was set...in London. They just didn't seem to realise that the vast majority of London doesn't look like Westminster."
"Horse shit is recycled hay and grass. Dog shit is recycled meat, processed food, and whatever other bollocks the dog has eaten."
"How often do you watch track and field events outside the Olympics or perhaps the Commonwealth games? Not at all, perhaps?"
"&gt; If you give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest of men, I will find something in them which will hang him.

"""Butt"" is a word we use. It refers to a water tank or the end of a cigarette. There are also several million words in our language, so we don't always use ""bum""."
"&gt; Our justice system is and has been for hundreds of years, considered very fair, but we see small Sharia courts opening for Muslim issues in the UK. 

That's bollocks mate. You perception of the world is being fucked with by people with agendas. What we actually have a quasi-legal tribunal things which both parties have to agree to submit to the judgement of before those tribunals have any power whatsoever, and even then any judgement they come could easily be overturned by a real court should it be found to be contradicting British law. 

The reality is that if we didn't give some kind of legal status to such courts people would just make them informally, which would mean you'd have people willingly following the decisions of Muslim religious leaders without any legal record or accountability, and we'd have no idea if what people were being instructed to do was contrary to British law or not. 

In Britain the only binding law on anyone is British law. The only problem is that deeply religious of people of all faiths will choose to have their religious authority decide things for them. They are going to do it anyway regardless of the law anyway, in the same way a Catholic couple might choose not to divorce despite it's legality. It's much smarter to provide some legal framework for this to ensure religious authorities aren't encouraging anyone to do anything that contravenes the law of the land."
"You can joke about anything so long as you're punching up, not down. 

Want to joke about Hillsborough? Fine, so long as the butt of the joke is the police or the Sun. 

"
"That's a very odd place to start. I've lived in Britain all my 37 years. Do you know how many 'country fairs' I've been to? Exactly none. I'm struggling to see that as a defining aspect of British culture.

The NHS, Shakepeare, pubs, Corrie, Dizzee Rascal, Sunday roast, allotments, the BBC and it's ""unique funding"" (terribly out-of-date now, but says a lot about how we've respected public service broadcasting), curries that are never eaten in India, pensioners taking coach trips, Amy Winehouse - that's the start of my definition off the top of my head"
Invade France!
*Candy* is crystallised sugar - as in *candy floss* [cotton candy] - but it's not used as a term for confectionery in general.

"On the 15th of February in 1971 the UK decimalised its currency. Before that, instead of having 100 pennies to the pound we used a slightly mad system with 240 pennies to the pound, with shillings being a smaller denomination of 12 pence. 

So the currency got reorganised and the old coins stopped being legal tender. There was also a period of overlap, I believe the old two shilling coin was used as a 10p piece for a while. So you wouldn't see a modern British coin from before 1971 because there aren't any. "
"I had some stuff stolen from me a while back. If it wasnt you, then i take it you dont mind me searching your house?"
"There was a post today possibly in AskUK about what was British culture. For some it would be having a back garden with a path down one side, a bit of lawn, a bit of a flower bed, a shed at the end and a small patio. I think there is a good amount of people who like having a ""bit of a garden""."
"Someone asked this a couple of weeks ago.

- They need to check your prescription is in stock.
- They need to confirm it's actually a legit prescription
- They need to dispense the stock and account for it on their logs.
- It's has to be checked and signed off by another technician/pharmacist 

And. Just in case you didn't realise. You are not the first and only person needing a prescription filled. There are also customers who came in before you, home deliveries and dispensing to the health centre for things like vaccines. "
Remain indoors.
"I honestly think the one and only topic you genuinely can't joke about in the UK is Hillsborough. I understand why it was such a horrible event but I cannot understand why it is, like I say, the only thing we literally cannot joke about. 
"
Not good enough. Needs much tougher sentences and the criminal should be banned from owning animals ever again. 
"I'm a comedy producer. Here's some advice; if you're only just starting out, avoid ANYTHING controversial. You wont do it justice until you're a more seasoned comedian. 

Nothing is off limits if done properly. "
If Jimmy Carr is your benchmark you may wish to reconsider that.
"You need to make this call and when you do you're going to get the help and advice you need. You need to be strong just for a moment and make the call, as soon as you've spoken to them they will put you at ease, that's their job. Before you call remember these things and keep them in mind....

Understand that the person you get through to is not going to judge you for a second, they're there to help you and they will want to help you.

They're not going to test you, they're not going to try and catch you out or anything, they're trained to help people, that's their job, to help.

When you call them say to them first ""Can i just say i get nervous on the phone so please be patient with me"" After that they'll treat you with extra care, i promise you.

I would make the call for you if i could but i know you've got the strength to do it yourself. Try not to worry, you'll be fine. Go and make the call."
24 hour clocks are objectively better. 
"&gt; you should be expected to integrate into that culture rather than expecting that culture to change for you.

When it's rather been the other way around, hasn't it? It wasn't too long ago that a penniless Portuguese immigrant started cooking up a dish from his native land and selling it on the street. From that point on, no discussion of ""British Culture"" would be complete without Fish &amp; Chips. From India we get Bungalows, Currys, Pyjamas, G&amp;Ts and Snooker. We say people are doolally instead of insane, we say things are pukka rather than good, Thugs instead of villains. We use an Urdu word for *foreign* when we're feeling patriotic about our island. Yes, even *Blighty* is an import.

Multiculture is a bit of a folly. But expecting newcomers to change without changing a little bit in return is absolutely insane. Britain wouldn't be Britain without the changes made by foreign culture."
I didn't realise that McGuyver was a real thing and not something made up for The Simpsons. 
It's Britain's class problems in poo form.
"&gt; I think there is a good amount of people who like having a ""bit of a garden"".

Of course. How else would we have a spontaneous BBQ during our 3 hours of summer?"
"There's a joke in a mid-period Simpsons episode about Krusty being such a bad gambler that he bet against the Harlem Globetrotters. 10 year old me took that to mean that the Globetrotters were the best team by far in the NBA, and win every season. You would also hear things like ""Real Madrid are becoming the Harlem Globetrotters of football"" when they bought all the greatest superstar players. I was probably 20 or so before I found out that the Globetrotters aren't a real team, they do like comedy and trickshots for exhibition shows. That's what the joke was. "
"Because every time local councils suggest that a particular area could be used to build a bunch of new homes, all the NIMBYs come out of the woodwork and block it.


Said NIMBYs are also usually the very same people that already own homes purchased multiple decades ago and are often out of touch with the reality of trying to buy somewhere to live in the current market. "
"I'm a pharmacist so I can answer this question for you. A quick caveat though, I'm a hospital pharmacist not a community pharmacist and I've never worked in community. That said, the basic processes are the same. It's is never as simple as just checking the drug is in stock. 

First things first, unless there is an extremely good reason, you dispense all prescriptions in the order you receive them. Everybody is urgent and everybody is in a hurry. So even if the pharmacy is empty there may well be several in front of you. 

When the pharmacist gets your prescription there is a lot of information they have to check. They'll verify the prescription meets all the legal requirements, so it's written correctly for a real patient by a real doctor. They might check that the prescription isn't from an fp10 pad that's been reported stolen. 

Then they'll look at the drugs themselves. Assuming it's a prescription for only one drug they might look at the patients dispensing record to make sure there isn't any major drug/drug interactions or significant co-morbidities that contraindicate that drug. They'll check that the drug is prescribed at an appropriate dose for a patient of that age, gender, weight, indication etc. Assuming this is all fine it will then go to a colleague, usually a technician or dispenser, to label it. Labelling has pretty strict rules although when I get my prescriptions from a community pharmacy I'm often dissapointed by the standard. The dispenser finds the drug, which can sometimes be trickier that  you think. Community pharmacies are often way too small to tidily stock the wide range of drugs they need to. They make the label etc. and stick it on the box. A decent dispenser though will be able to do this very quickly and a good one will also be doing basic safety checks to make sure the pharmacist hasn't missed anything. 

Then it goes back to either the pharmacist or a qualified ACPT to do the final accuracy check. This will involve scrutinising the label to make sure all of the legally mandated information is present and correct and they should also be doing a sense check on the how appropriate the dose is for the patient, how appropriate the drug is, is it a safe quantity to supply and a dozen other minor details that are legal requirements. Up until recently it was a criminal offence to make an unintentional dispensing error. If a pharmacist or technician made a dispensing error that resulted in patient harm, they could have been held responsible without vicarious liability protection. So even if the number one priority wasn't making sure the patient is safe, protecting your livelihood is a pretty good motivation for getting it 100% right 100% of the time. 

Drugs are serious business and whilst doctors have a hell of a lot of knowledge about medicines, pharmacists are the people they go to for advice on how to safely and effectively prescribe medicines. I think most people would be horrified to learn about the interventions pharmacists make every day that saves lives.  

I have skipped over a lot of very boring details here, the actual process involves quite a bit more.   "

"I've mentioned this in the past, but one of the things that stood out to me about the UK was that people don't seem to build ""up"" as much as I'd expect. I'm not just talking skyscrapers. Both my brother's townhouse and my former townhouse back home have the garage on the bottom floor. The rest of the house is then built up on top of it. I'm living in a similar unit here, but everyone has separate parking spots, which takes up more land that could be used for larger units or even guest parking.

I look at a lot of the new homes with tiny patches called gardens and I think I'd rather just do without it and have more living space. A lot of people probably have different feelings though."
They aren't a real team? Crikey!
"I find it to be much rarer that someone from India will take on an anglicized name than someone from China.

And when they do, its usually a shortening like Mohammed -&gt; Mo, or Parmaveer -&gt; Paz. Whereas a chinese bloke might go from Kong Wei to ""Eric"""

Sadly I would ask, why buy such nice new cars when you don't have a place to put them that is safe?"
