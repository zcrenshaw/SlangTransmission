"Her opinion on feminist is that men and women are equal. That everyone should be allowed to do what they wish with their lives without undue social pressure.

I don't see how belle or topless pictures is controversial. 

Her views reflect my own. Those who disagree with her are either sexist or don't understand what feminism is."

"I eat the chocolate ones first as they're the worst and I want them out the way. 

Then the yellow ones. 

Then the pink ones as they're the best.

"Their train station/airport shops are probably what keeps them going, they have a bit of a monopoly on it. Personally I go to smiths because I know what I'm getting, their stationery is expensive but it's good quality and I'm a big saddo who also loves to stand and browse books for a while."
"It's worth noting that wages in the UK are much less than the USA anyway. Doctors are paid less than half here than they are in the USA. Engineers, IT jobs - also are often as much as half the USA salary. It's not really a fair comparison because the associated living costs are different, taxes are different and we don't have additional costs such as healthcare, as well as our student fees and student debt system being very different so the investment into a qualification is perceived differently and thus the payment for having that qualification is not the same.


The NHS pays in bands and as you climb the rank you get a higher pay banding. My friend is a nurse, straight out of uni she was on 21k, terrible wage for high pressure 12 hours shifts, but within 3 years she was on £35k with the NHS. She is working towards specializing in the ultrasound / endoscopy department and should be on £40-45k in another 5 years. Considering that will be by the time she is in her early 30s that is a pretty good wage for the UK... but nurses have to endure a lot of long working hours and a very high pressure job to get there.

Entry level salaries for nursing should be much higher, when you take into account the long working hours, extreme pressure they can be put under and how essential their services are... it is no wonder that British nursing is in decline, with a lot of people not being able to put in the years required to actually get to a good career level."
"This isn't a full reply, but the Guardian had [a fantastic longread](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/16/what-happens-when-queen-elizabeth-dies-london-bridge) recently on the procedures which occur upon the Queen's death. It's also available in [podcast form](https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2017/mar/20/london-bridge-is-down-the-secret-plan-for-the-days-after-the-queens-death-podcast).

I listened to the latter, and whilst I in no way consider myself a royalist there were parts of it which did get me a little emotional and choked up. I guess it's one of those things which highlights how the world can change so much from what you are used to, and how nothing is ever 100% stable."

"Originally, most roads are built with the houses in order, evens on one side and odds the other. 

However over the years, properties get added. What do you do when number 33 gets split into two flats? You can't add 34, that's over the road. You can't add 32, that's there too - so the two new flats become 33A and 33B. 

Imagine there's one long crescent road but it has a little offshoot of a handful of houses. It's not worth making it its own road, so to make the houses easier to find, it'll often be signed ""35-45 odds"" for example, which just means ""if you're looking for an odd numbered house between these numbers, it's down here"".

Things like ""Rear of 100"" normally mean someone has built some kind of workshop or outbuilding in their garden; it's not a true separate property, but it helps delivery drivers find the right place. 

Units are normally on industrial estates - rather than using house numbers, you use unit numbers; normally because businesses change and expand and it's common to take over the unit next door. So a business might start running out of Unit A but grow, so take over the next door ones, so their address becomes ""Unit A-D, Whatever Industrial Estate, Something Road"".

Hope that helps. "
I have never heard of it or seen it

"If you look at the [latest figures](http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN04033), what you'll see is that the public spending per head is much higher in the rest of the UK than in England. That's what he seems to be alluding to. 

It's a bit disingenuous, however, since London also has a considerably high spending per head and no one says England ""sends London several thousand pounds per person""."
I'd be more worried about it being sold and a huge housing estate housing built on it.
Definitely a pineapple. A sweet luxury item. 
"&gt; It's a bit disingenuous, however, since London also has a considerably high spending per head and no one says England ""sends London several thousand pounds per person"".

Possibly because of how much tax London raises.  The financial services sector in London provides 11% of the UK's tax receipts on its own, so evil bankers have some advantages.

Of course Scotland would claim its North Sea oil paid for a lot of things for several decades."
I remember the time we rented a pineapple for my 21st. People still stop me in the street to talk about it.

"I don't know why you're getting downvoted as you are entirely correct. My wife is an A&amp;E sister; she gets seven weeks paid leave per year. Many would rather be paid £28k and seven weeks leave, than be paid £45k but have no time off.

"The NHS Blood Service is *specifically* saying [they don't need extra blood] (https://twitter.com/GiveBloodNHS/status/866915391616032768).  Just keep donating regularly, it's the best thing you can do."

"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!!!!

I borrowed £20 from Wonga several years ago on the advice of a friend. That started me down a path that would see me £10k in debt in just a few years.

At first it was fine, £15 here, £25 there, I could handle it, no problem.

If you are having to borrow those amounts, then it stands to reason you don't have savings or an emergency fund. What happens if you have an unexpected expense for £4-5-600? It seems you don't have the money and most in that situation would go to a payday loan.

There is ALWAYS a better solution out there than payday loans. Always!"

"Stoke-on-Trent 

Its really a great example of a British city that has seen its industry vanish and not replaced by anything. It has some of the largest council estates in the UK, some of the lowest percentage of educated residents, and some of the lowest house prices in the UK. 

I lived there for about 10 years as a teenager, and while I can honestly say I miss my friends from Stoke, I don't miss the place in the slightest. It is a total shit hole. "
"Make sure you don't send chocolate. American chocolate is awful, it tastes like vomit to us."
"I think people underestimate how popular the Queen is and especially for older people, she has been a fixture in their lives. Prime Ministers, celebrities, etc, have come and gone, but the Queen has remained.

For many, it will be quite strange for a while and hopefully Charles will not come under sustained attack from the media, who don't really like him."
"Always check the weight/volume of the product.          
Pound shops tend to sell special reduced size products which can make them more expensive then normal supermarkets.          
eg 5 pack of walkers crisps for £1 vs 2x 6 packs for £2 in normal supermarkets.

They are normally good for toiletries and canned food.
If they sell Nicky Elite toilet roll it's about the best toilet roll on the market and works out at about 22p a roll if you buy the 18 packs (normally £4)"

"&gt; Adderall isn't covered or prescribed by the NHS. The coverage isn't a problem - I can (probably) pay for it out of pocket - but I'm a little confused about the actual process of acquiring it, even if I pay for it myself.

Adderall isn't licensed in the UK. In fact, since it's an amphetamine it's actually a Class B controlled substance (like cannabis or ketamine). The process of acquiring it will be similar to how you would acquire other illegal drugs - something a bit outside the scope of this sub!

You can read the guidelines for treating adult ADHD in the UK here - https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG72/chapter/Recommendations#treatment-of-adults-with-adhd - but I'm afraid that if you want to be prescribed medication for it here then your choices are limited to methylphenidate, dexamfetamine, lisdexamfetamine, atomoxetine or guanfacine, as those are the only ones licensed here."

"&gt; Originally, most roads are built with the houses in order, evens on one side and odds the other.

Probably also worth adding that traditionally the lower numbers normally start off at the end of the road closest to the city/town centre.

---

This is why a good rule of thumb if you're lost in a residential area in a strange UK city it to always walk down roads towards the low numbers and you should (in theory) eventually get to the centre ...or more realistically you'll at least end up in a much more built up area where you're more likely to see landmarks, signposts, etc."
I've never heard that before but it's good.
This is legitimately one of the pettiest posts I've ever seen. You're both being ridiculous.
