"Arsenal fans are well known for their love of all things white.

As they haven't historically won much as a club they are really proud of the two times they reached the champions league final.

You might want to get some (white?) t-shirts made up with players names on the back, recent arsenal legends include Sagna, Nasri, Van Persie, Adebayor, Anelka, Fabregas, Kane and depending on how old your friend is, Lineker he was an 80s to early 90s footballer.

In terms of good London food, everyone here loves jellied eels, they're a really popular party food. No party is complete without cocktail sausages, they are tiny pork sausages on a toothpick stick that you serve in a bloody Mary (can be virgin or alcoholic) and scotch eggs (ignore the name not Scottish!) You wrap an egg in pork meat and cover the resulting ball in breadcrumbs. Some people leave the shell on for crunch but it's not generally popular.

Pie and mash is a popular London food, that should be easy to make, the liquor sauce is traditionally green and is made from gooseberries in gin that's simmered for a long while, but many people don't like the liquor, you may want gravy instead - meat  gravy not country gravy.... Plus I've never seen gooseberries on my trips stateside

I'm not sure how to best cover activities. We sometimes play London's burning. You put someone in a cardboard box and then light a corner of it and see how quick they can get out... Obviously don't use an accelerant.

We also play pin the tail on the welshie, you draw a comedy picture of a fat man carrying a sheep and you put a blind fold on the contestant and they have to put a pin on the tail position on the Welshman or the sheep.. Bonus points for the Welshman

Sorry I can't think of many more at this point

Good luck, I hope your friend has a great birthday!

"He was very popular when he was a regular on Mock The Week and other panel shows. Popular enough to have his own show on Channel 4, but that got a critical pasting and very swiftly cancelled. 

His popularity has waned a little since and he's been largely out of the public eye for a while. Couldn't even tell you what he's been up to lately. 

He's always come across to me as a bit desperate for attention, negative or otherwise. "
"Baseball is quite popular in some schools.

We call it rounders and it is played by girls."
"I suggest watching the Channel 4 TV series ""The Inbetweeners"" and attempting to recreate the parties portrayed in excruciating detail."
"Feign surprise. Act as if you were genuinely unaware of this, and as if it's news to you."
"Tell her to start googling 


""is spying on wifi traffic illegal""


 ""how to report cyber stalking"" 


""would cyber stalking cause loss of job""


 ""MoD complaints telephone number""


""[housemates name] I know you're watching me, fuck off""


If he is spying, then he'll be embarrassed and stop. If he's not watching then all good and he won't know."
"Firstly, based on my experience of America, lose the red cups and drink from glass like adults. 

If you know he likes Indian food then you already answered one of your own questions. If you want to be stereotypical and not bothered about realism, you could print off a red phone box door and stick it to the front door. Maybe a UK flag or two or the gunners logo. As for activities Google British drinking games. I don't know how different they are to UK ones "

I'd go pub
Uni sports teams are usually drinking societies that play sport at times 
"Work to contract. Shit will back up, stuff will break, then they'll give you more people.

Work to contract, always work to contract, unless its you *directly* who will be rewarded if something goes well. "
"+1 to the jellied eels. One of the most traditional London foods out there and one I always seek out when I'm going to the East End.

Yes, the big one: liquor v gravy, almost as big a local derby as brown sauce v red sauce.

I'd just add Ashley Cole to your list of Arsenal heroes, and perhaps some choc ices could be served for dessert."
Have a mock election and get people to crash their economy. We did it and how we are laughing now!!!!     :-(
He should be entering prison on war crime charges.
"It's the sort of thing that my mum, or teachers at school, might regard as slovenly. Total bollocks, then."
"Keep the lights low and make sure never to make eye contact with anyone, especially not the birthday boy. Never mention it being his birthday. Say 'we're having a legs up for you mate', and grimace at the ground. He will nod silently.

Sit in a circle around a coffee table, cover it in playing cards and empty cans. Drink. Continue to drink. Say 'I'm cunted' and order a kebab or a curry. Snog some bird. Drink more.

When he starts throwing up, you know you've done well. Say 'alright mate?' but don't expect a reply. Sleep. Awaken, now make eye contact to share how ashamed you are of both yourself, and more importantly, him. Say 'I was fucked last night', make him a cup of tea and kick him out of your place."
"&gt; His popularity has waned a little since and he's been largely out of the public eye for a while. Couldn't even tell you what he's been up to lately. 

He took a decision to step away from comedy for a while, especially from TV work. I think there was a bit of a burnout feeling, especially after having to take a tabloid to court for libel, he wanted to spend time doing some writing.

He's actually a softly-spoken and thoughtful person. The 'offensive' Frankie is a stage persona. One of the reasons he decided to stop doing TV work was that he became unfairly known for one-line shockers, whereas his stand-up routines work by gradually pushing boundaries further and further. I also recall him saying that he also started to realise his TV appearances were only showing one small section of his overall approach to joke-writing, due to the limits on both content and language used.

(IIRC it was The Mirror he sued? They called him racist, and he won, i.e. proving *beyond reasonable doubt* that he was not racist. There were reports of the jury having to be told to not laugh, while watching footage of his performances.)"
"They tend to report things without confirming them. Some people think it's worth it for faster news - i just think it's a shitty and lazy journalism.

Also its owned by the same guy as fox news in america , and while it's not as extreme, it often adapts similar positions. 

I wouldn't lend it money if it was a person."
"I don't hate Americans, but what I do find irritating is the sanctimonious national pride, how veterans are seen as demigods, how your politics is just mud slinging and discussions of kind of political nature just descends into kneejerk retorts.

However I find exactly the same stuff happens in the UK, its just a bit more extreme in the US."

"OFSTED independently judge schools effectiveness. A bad rating (labeled Requires Improvement) by OFSTED can set a lot of things in motion. Parents use OFSTED ratings as decision making tools to select a school to send their kids, which in turn leads to funding. 

The rain your teachers are on edge of because they are receiving a lot of pressure from senior management, who receive it from the head teacher, who receives it from the governors and public to do well. 

In reality, they will rush home and make sure all the books for the lessons over the next 2 days are marked, so if OFSTED ask to see them they can see feedback has been given. Your teachers can also be dropped in on and observed by an OFSTED inspector for about 10-20 minutes in any lesson of the inspectors choosing. No one likes having being watched doing their job, and is worse when an inspector come in with a clipboard who you've never met and based on just those 10 minutes decides if you are an effective teacher or not.

"&gt;Three times in two months we've put offers on flats in london, negotiated, had the offer accepted and then, after a short amount of time, had the estate agents continue to view the flats and continue to get offers, each time to get gazumped.

You just need to be a complete arsehole about getting the property off the market.

Firstly, put in writing that the offer is conditional on the house no longer being viewed.

Get timescales for how long it will take to get the property out of the shop window, and off Rightmove etc.

Go and check the Estate Agents window and websites the 24 hours later and raise hell if it's not done.

If they are still not playing ball, pull out.  

Unfortunately, what you can't do is stop a *seller* who wants to keep looking for better offers, despite accepting.  Remember, the estate agents mainly want to get paid quickly.  Selling a house for an extra £10k might be an extra £200 to them, but losing the sale entirely might mean £5-£10k commission down the drain.  

Depends how hot the market is, but I've definitely known estate agents refuse to keep viewing properties in a slower market, just to not bugger up what they've got."
"Fish and chips!! (Chips for this one being the fat chunky potato ones and not fries :) I think you guys call them jojos?)

You could probably find a good Brit-pop playlist on youtube. Or footy anthems.
Union Jacks everywheeeeeeeeeeeere. 
To recreate a legit pub feeling, have someone drop a glass and everyone shout ""wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyyyyyyy"" at the same time. I don't know why that is (still) a thing, but it's a thing."
"...that wouldn't actually be too bad

All in favour say aye"

"It's a very alien concept to the majority of the UK, I would say you're probably not going to get very much useful feedback."

"Just breakdown and start crying, whilst saying ""That happened a week ago! You never notice"""
Not making eye contact at all would be considered a sign of being socially inept
"Horribly conflicted.

Would I vote for almost anyone I think could stop the country I used to love going further down this selfish, fascist, self-destructive path? Yes.

But *him*? Blair is that very special kind of evil that never regrets its actions. They cannot be wrong, because he thinks he's a good person. 

My background is a socially liberal, fiscally capitalistic approach, fairly well aligned with the Liberal Democrats. I'm of the view that May's government is going to take this country to the point where I'm ashamed to call myself British.

Really don't know what call I'd make."

"I love him. He still pops up on Radio 4 quite often and I make an effort to catch him.

He's never been massive but he still has a loyal following.

He may not be as offensive as you think. There's an element of context to it that might be going over your head if you're not getting him or if you're watching YouTube highlights.."

"I use this. I've had 5 lodgers now and it's been great. Some tips incase you're new to this:

- get a deposit. No excuses.

- kick them out if they miss a payment. You don't have to give them any notice.

- write a contract. No personals in shared spaces, no candles, number of nights their partner can stay over, just general house rules etc.

- hire a cleaner. I pay £12 for an hour a week. Zero disputes about mess. They even take the bins out.

- I think you need a fire extinguisher by law? Get one anyway. And a smoke alarm &amp; carbon monoxide detector.

- CCTV for the front door. Worried about your TV going missing? Not any more.

- lock your bedroom door. Get a safe.

- change your front door lock after **every** lodger and don't leave the back door key etc laying around.

- repair things as soon as they're broken.

- a fully furnished spare room gets snapped up so much quicker, but be prepared to store furniture if it's not required.

- get a photocopy of their passport. Make sure they're legal.

Well I've finished my poop now, these are just a few things I've learnt, some the hard way. All in all it's totally fucking worth it."
