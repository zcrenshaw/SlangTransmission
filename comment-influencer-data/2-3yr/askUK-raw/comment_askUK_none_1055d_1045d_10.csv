"It's alright I suppose. We've got, err, Nectar points. They're quite handy."
"Bletchley Park might interest your dad but would recommend museum in London area, so that you can visit more than one exhibit."
"You're 17, some people would say your adult life hasn't even *started* yet, you can change everything.

I've been overweight-obese most of my life, and the only thing it really makes harder is your love life.  Most people don't care what their friends or colleagues look like.  So don't let your weight hold you back.  We're all a long time dead, don't let fear make you hide for any longer.

First things you need to do in my opinion:

- Eat 5 portions of fruit and veg a day (usually 80g is a portion, or like 1 apple, 1 cereal bowl of salad).  Drink 2 litres of pure water.  Eat and drink whatever else you want, but make yourself do that.  Just try and put some goodness in you, see if you feel motivated to fix your diet further after that.

- Walk.  Walk for 30 minutes a day.  If you need to stop, you stop.  If you want to go out late at night or early in the morning until you feel confident, do it.  But walk daily.  After a week or two, make it an hour.  It will help your mental and physical health massively.  And what else are you doing all day?

- Find some information about colleges for A-Levels (or GCSEs if you need to re-sit).  Research online or get a relative to make calls if you don't feel up to it.  Just give yourself the start of a future to look forward to.  If you need to lean on your family, let them help you - they can't enjoy seeing you like this.

Hope this helps."
"It's what? 10 years since we ran out? I found an old tin of the stuff in a cupboard last year. Some guy offered me £80 for it. But I thought the kids would like it, they've never lived in a time when that was really possible. They couldn't believe how good it was. 

I told them not to tell the kids at school but they couldn't help it. Some other kid ratted us out to the head teacher who had to report it, and we've had the full investigation, the works. We're due in court next month on pineapple smuggling charges. Seems daft but it's the law. I'll plead guilty, I just hope it's not jail time but the £5k fine will hurt. "
"Pretty much anything and everything.

Except pineapples. Very rare and considered a delicacy here."
"&gt; Or is it more of a family with kids occasion?

Oh no it's not!"
"Based on your commentary above I can say with 100% certainty that no matter what car you drive, you'll still be a cunt."
"Don't send American chocolate. You guys use an ingredient that makes it taste like vomit, and we're not used to that, as our chocolate is sweet."
crumpets is just a slang word for fish and chips.

"We've got understatement. We're tough on slogans and tough on the causes of slogans. We have strong prevailing southwesterly winds. Fifty two percent of our days are overcast so as a nation we're infused with a wistful melancholy. But we remain a relentlessly chipper population prone to mild eccentricity, binge drinking and casual violence."

"Cigarettes have no redeeming features. They are expensive, stink, highly addictive, and after the first couple don't even make you feel good. On top of that they cause cancer and other serious medical problems.

Alcohol is also a powerful drug but one which, if used in small amounts, is both more socially acceptable than cigarettes and less harmful to you. However it can also be very addictive, especially psychologically, and you should never allow yourself to be pressured to drink anything you don't actually want to."
A lot will buy stuff from the same frozen food supplier. 
"There's also [Irish Citizenship](http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving_country/irish_citizenship/your_right_to_irish_citizenship.html) which will give you access to the EU and the UK possibly until 2019 (or until we get trumped ^I'll ^see ^myself ^out ).

"The person from Newcastle clearly isn't because it's a well used term in the North East.

If you submit her to the grand board of the North East we will organise her to be retrained and mentally evaluated to see if she is ""from"" the North East or not."
"Your beef is with the Amazon seller. You don't have a contract with Royal Mail so that part isn't your problem.

http://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/regulation/distance-selling-regulations#delivery

Note when they say delivery, they mean into your hands and not some other home that isn't associated with you.

File a claim against the Amazon seller. Keep everything documented. Worst case would be to contact your credit card company and have the money returned to you that way (you did pay by credit card didn't you)."
"The problem with asking people to tell you who to support is that support for a team here is very rarely chosen by the individual. It's either your local team, the team your parents or just your dad supports or a mix of the two if you live somewhere with multiple teams like London and a few other places.

Obviously foreign fans get to pick a team but for most UK fans it's almost like being born into a clan."

Why are people cunts?
"I'd just say be careful that you don't have a romanticised 'Downton Abbey' view of the UK.

Yes, life IS great here, but it still depends on your life-situation and privileged people have fewer struggles than non-privileged ones.

We don't know if we are good at getting an effective government tbh.

Yes, the scenery is very nice in loads of places- of course the biggest thing is that things are on a smaller scale than the USA.

I'm sure others will fill in details.

Yes, it's true that you will be seen more as American than middle Eastern if you come over here (as soon as you speak!).

Also be aware, it is not easy to immigrate- maybe you are rich enough though to have independent means."

Have you thought about sending a pineapple? We don't get those here. 
Science museum in London?
"I found a tin in Tesco for 59p. When I took it to the checkout it wouldn't scan and they accused me of pineapple smuggling. When I was clearly innocent the lady called the manager. They offered to sell  me it for £65 ""off the record"" and when I said no they put it in a safe. 

I'm getting fed up of this pineapple smuggling law to be honest. It's getting out of hand. People have lost their homes over it! "

I'm sure it'll be fine but make sure you dress up.  I suggest one goes as Rolf Harris and the other as Jimmy Saville and you aim for the Saturday matinee.

I'd recommend Bletchley Park for anyone with a passing interest in Computing. If it's a weekend visit then you could stay in London and take the train to Bletchley Park one day and head to South Kensington for the (free) Science Museum and Natural History Museum the other day. Or the Imperial War Museum if he's more into military tech. 
The last thing the UK needs is more HR people I would imagine.
Oh yes it is!
"&gt;you guys seem to know what the hell you're doing in terms of electing and running an effective government as far as I can tell.

"You're presumably American, so the answer is that we eat pretty much the same things you eat, which is to say anything and everything.

Probably a different balance of cuisines though- we eat a lot more Indian and a fair bit less Mexican. Thai seems to be more popular in the UK than it is in the US too. French, Chinese and Italian probably about the same (though our Italian is closer to what actual Italians eat), Japanese maybe a bit less but growing fast. If you're in a city you probably have access to Lebanese, Nepalese, Vietnamese and a variety of other international foods, but they're not as prominent as the others I've mentioned.

As far as stereotypical British food goes, we really don't eat that much of it. I have fish and chips maybe twice a year.

"I think a pantomime is certainly a family affair but there is nothing wrong with two adults going alone. It would be like adults going to see the latest Toy Story or Finding Dory film, definitely family films but it's fine for adults to go. "
We do not mean any insult by it. It is just our custom to be ironic. All the time.

"Snoozing is a mug's game, you waste time and feel worse. I've heard of people doing so many snoozes they spend an hour pressing a button every 8 minutes. 

30 minutes from alarm to leaving the house. Bag is already packed, showered the night before, clothes are sorted. I just need to step into my clothes, do my teeth and take a shit. I make sure it is all out, I get two buses and I have had some really close calls busting for a crap at 7am in the dark on a bus rumbling along god knows where. "
