"&gt;Don't want to ask reception and seem cheap, any ideas?

You must learn not to be embarrassed to confront people about such things. This is how con artists and used car salesmen ply their trade. And apparently dodgy hotels looking to scam guests into using the minibar. "

"I'd still say Britain, I like America and Americans but they're a bit too 'wholesome' for me, you can't have a laugh as easily with them. 

Big thing for me is I wouldn't be financially better off there, I can understand people who move out there because wages are much higher in their chosen field. "
"I dont think anyone was prepared for Queen. 

Not only did they produce songs still played today, Freddie Mercury was so charismatic his image and story are still common in todays culture. "

"It's a bit more subtle than that - Ofcom, the communications regulator, have set aside a few different ranges of numbers for drama use.

"Definitely UK, regardless of the shiny fun things the US has that we don't. We're drunker and colder and wetter but we're better off; thanks to our NHS, no Trump, very little gun violence, very little violence in general by comparison to America, and everything here is close enough to travel to in a day.

"Only white people are allowed outside of the M25 I'm afraid.

But in all seriousness, you will be fine. Sheffield and Reading, along with many other large towns and cities in the UK, have multicultural populations. You will get bigots in all towns and cities, though."
"They'd hate me then, I'm not very good at ""reacting"" to stuff like that. I wouldn't jump up and down or scream or anything.

"I would recommend signing a second cat in the January Transfer Window. You know- strengthen the squad after some away defeats.

A kitten you know is projected to grow into a large cat (because a fully-grown cat will more likely upset your existing cat).

I'll have a better answer for you later..."
"Seems like a pretty shitty thing to do. 

Maybe next time phone them up and say you've just finished the bottle of complementary wine and wanted to know how much another would be. I'd be interested to know what their reaction would be.

Or to phone down and say you're a recovering alcoholic and found the 'gesture' highly offensive."
The cheeky bastards! 
"I was plagued with these calls for a while, until I started chatting with them and told them the accident (which didn't happen) was my fault. I made a big deal of telling them how the death of that child was tearing me apart. They hung up and haven't called since. "
"1) It has been going on for a long time.

2) Most people think things are worse now.

3) This is because there is more pressure on resources, especially because we have an ageing population.

4) It is always used as a political football - under a Tory government, they say they are spending more, and the Opposition says that in real terms, things are worse.

5) Coldest months of course produce the greatest pressure for the system, exacerbated by the holiday period.

6) A recent thread indicated everyone's personal experience of the NHS remained more or less 100% positive."
"Or just have fun. Answer the phone but don't say anything, just breathe loudly. Start breathing louder if they ask you something.

Or ask them what they're wearing and if they like hot chocolate on their body. 

Or you start asking questions about their accident and their money that's just sitting there.

Or try to sell them a blender.

Or try to convince them to change their electrical company.

Or try to get advice about this chicken bruschetta that you're making. Keep interrupting them if they try to say anything unrelated to your chicken, keep asking if yellow tomatoes are fine or if you must use red ones. 

Just run wild, it will be fun for both parties. "

"Supermarket pizza is cheap but take out and deliveries are heinously expensive compared to most of Europe. I don't know who these fools are that spend 20 quid on a Dominos when a Chinese or Indian would cost half that but they obviously exist as Dominos and Papa Johns are still in business. 

edit: I'll add that the local Dominos-esque chain in Germany was decently bought out by Dominos and they practically doubled their prices overnight. "
Not OP but I think he's referring to the puritanical nature of the US.

"They'd be a pretty terrible gp if they shouted at you.

They might give you a bit of a lecture, but not so much a ""telling off"" more like a serious ""this is what you have to do to be healthy"".

There there to help you, they want you to be healthy. I think sometimes GPs can be quite blunt about your lifestyle choices, but they're doing it with your best interests in mind."
"&gt; Irony is, of course, the key word here. Americans don't use it much. (I'm being ironic; they don't use it at all.) In most circumstances this is actually rather a nice thing. Irony is cousin to cynicism, and cynicism is not a virtuous emotion. Americans — not all of them, but a significant proportion — have no need for either one. Their approach to everyday encounters is trusting, straight-forward, almost touchingly literal. They don't expect any verbal sleight of hand in conversations, so it tends to throw them when you employ it.

&gt; We have a neighbour on whom I tested this hypothesis for the first two years we were here. It began innocently enough. Soon after we moved in, he had a tree come down in his front garden. I passed his house one morning to see that he was cutting the tree into smaller pieces and loading them onto the roof of his car to take away to the tip. It was a bushy tree and the branches were hanging over the sides in an extravagant manner.

&gt; 'Ah, I see you're camouflaging your car,' I remarked drily.

&gt; He looked at me for a moment. 'No,' he said emphatically. 'I had a tree come down in the storm the other night and now I'm taking it away for disposal.'

&gt; After that, I couldn't stop myself from making little jokes with him. The crunch, so to speak, came when I was telling him one day about some disastrous airline trip I'd had, which had left me stranded overnight in Denver.

&gt; `Who did you fly with?' he asked.

&gt;`I don't know,' I replied. 'They were all strangers.'

&gt; He looked at me with an expression that betrayed a kind of panic.

&gt; 'No, I meant which airline did you fly with.'

&gt; It was just after this that my wife ordered me to cease making jokes with him because apparently our chats were leaving him with migraine.

"I really value history and nature, so I loved living in England. I could walk down the canal paths or in the countryside, and it was just so clean and beautiful. Unless you're on a hiking trail, you don't walk in the U.S., really. People use their cars for everything. 

I loved the groceries; you can buy really fresh vegetables and exotic things I can never find here in Utah. Sainsbury's had (hopefully they still do) a fresh-baked loaf of bread for £1 or so that was still hot from the oven. Plus, you can buy really nice ready-made things at Tesco like trifle or whatever.  Our food is shitty here in America. I'm sorry, but it's true. There's a lot of it, but the quality and makeup of it is terrible. Just look at our waistlines as proof. We eat too much of the wrong things and don't have healthy alternatives. 

I like British people more than Americans, I guess, as well. You don't have people pushing their religion or their politics on you in the UK, it's considered vulgar. Perfect strangers get right in your face in America and demand to know why you haven't accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior yet. Plus, this recent election just has me disgusted. 

The healthcare was fantastic in the UK, yes. I had to have a blood test. They gave me a Lidocaine patch to put on my arm so I wouldn't feel the needle go in.  I was like, ""It's just a little stab, I don't mind..."" and the nurse looked at me like I had two heads and said, ""No, there's no need to torture the patient."" It was just so...humane.  I don't go to the doctor often, but whenever I called for an appointment, they would say, ""Can you come right now?""  When I came back to the U.S. and made a routine appointment, I had to wait four weeks to see the GP.  And no, that is not an exaggeration. 

I also like the fun little bits of culture, like Evening at the Proms or Pantomimes, mince pies, and mulled wine at Christmas. Everybody leaving for Spain in August. 

I traveled all over, from Inverness to Land's End, the Isle of Man and Kent. I just loved it all. When I get homesick, it's always for the UK, not America."
"That's genius. 

My approach was to keep saying in my best posh accent ""Terribly sorry old chap, but I'm afraid I don't speak a word of English. Not a peep. I trust you understand""

The confusion was palpable."
"I think so, I think it's in the rules. 

Someone I know won, they turned up at her house unexpected and filmed the surprise moment when they told her how much she'd won, and it was on telly for a while.  She said if she'd had known they were coming round she would have made herself look nicer but she was just monging about at home when they turned up, not even brushed her hair or anything, but she won of £20k so she said she wasn't *that* bothered in the end."

"Don't know the answer, curious to know.

A guess would be it is free, as I'd expect the charge to be detailed somewhere.

How about you ask reception what the cost is, rather than if it's free?

If you're embarrassed, you can always say it's for expenses. "

"If you use a crossing regularly, you get to know if the button actually does anything - there are certain ones near me which I know go green because of the traffic lighting not because of the button, so I wouldn't bother. 

There's another one where I know that I can make it across between traffic changes, and that pressing the button actually just slows everyone down by ages unnecessarily. 

Also sometimes people just assume someone else has already pressed it. "
Suit up. Make the effort. First impressions are everything and you want them to think you go above and beyond. If it's too out of place or too hot you can remove the tie.

"UK.

The cooking shows across the pond are just too intense. I just want to watch people cook for 50 minutes, not 45 minutes of drama and 5 minutes of wondering what an ingredient is.

As much as this sounds like a joke, it is. But the point is that it's a reflection of wider cultural norms. Why is everything bigger, intenser, louder over there? I can't deal with that."

"You seem to be mixing up wealth with class, which is perhaps where a lot of your confusion comes from. You can be immensely rich and still working class; you can be living almost in penury and still be upper class.

The following are  answers to your questions from a fairly traditional point of view, as others have said class is far less important in British society today than it was 30+ years ago.

&gt; Are people who have become very famous and wealthy (ex: entertainment industry) but started out working class still considered working class after much success, recognition, and wealth?

Generally, yes. Few would say that, for example, Cheryl [Cole | Tweedy | Fernandez-Versini] or Shane Ritchie are anything other than working class. In fact it's often part of their appeal -- the idea that despite money and fame you're able to remain true to your roots goes a long way to helping retain public support for some celebrities.

&gt; What class do wealthy doctors and lawyers fit into?

I think doctors and lawyers, regardless of wealth, would generally be considered middle class. Although of course if the child of an aristocratic family goes into medicine -- or any other profession -- then he/she would remain upper class, regardless of how financially successful (or not) he/she was as a doctor.

&gt; When you have visitors and tourists from other countries, how do people judge their class? By British country standards or the visitors' own country's standards? Ex: Which class does a visiting wealthy US lawyer fall into from the British perspective?

They wouldn't be judged as belonging to a class because they're foreign. The clues and cues that Brits pick up on subconsciously don't work for people brought up outside this society.

&gt; If a working class girl marries a very upper class man, does she automatically become upper class? Is it considered to normal to marry within your class or is that not a thing? Is it looked down upon for an upper class person to marry a working class person?

I think Kate Middleton (who was very middle class, not very working class) is the closest example we have to this. And I think most people would consider her a full, proper member of the royal family. So yes, you can certainly become upper class by marriage; it's not automatic, though -- it's all to do with how you behave.

&gt; If you are elected to the House of Commons and came from working class background, are you automatically upper class because of your position?

MPs aren't generally considered upper class. The clue is in the name -- it's the House of Commons. The upper class sit in the House of Lords.

"It's that wonderful time of your life.   


Summer: about 16/17 year old, you and your band of not-so-merry Emo kids drink cider in the park before realising you shouldn't get that pissed because your mum expects you home that night.   

A sober part of your brain tells you to text her saying you're at a mate's place. All good.    


It's going well. The sun is scorching, old people walk past in disgust, and before you know it there are a few empty bottles of cider around you.   

Then shit hits the fan.   


In the last few hours you believe you're with the best people in the world. We all love each other. But we don't.   


It only takes one person to say one thing.   

This is a teenage Emo time. Sexual liberation. Everyone is bisexual.   

Kate says she fingered Joanne once, her boyfriend flips his shit, then Jacob goes ""Oi I sucked you off t'other week."" Fight ensues. We all find out every one of us has done something with another person. Cheats. Lies. Scandal.   

You don't remember getting home but you remember your mum giving you a lecture.   

Then you check MySpace the day after and for some strange reason, Simon has put you as a number 2 friend instead of being number 1 where you usually are.  

Harsh times because you have a crush on him.   "
God no. 
"Well, maybe try to contact her directly. At the weekend?

Gang up with the other neighbours - Perhaps even send her a note together.

However, ultimately I guess you will have to go back to the management company, and if necessary, then see what your legal position is."
"How bad does it look?                 
Could be worth reporting it as looking unfit for the road.

Have you tried asking a friend/family to park in her spot just before she is due back?          
Only way she can complain is to confront you which would give you an opening as well as a perfectly valid reason for doing it (no visitor space available)."
You mean they're legit adverts??  I always thought that they were really really bad actors.  Maybe they pick only people who have enough money that they're not too excited about it 
"If you want to buy it, buy it. Houses are for living in, not just as giant brick piggy banks. A Victorian terrace house can be a great family home, and a bungalow can be a miserable one - the key thing is that you're happy in it. The 'investment potential' may vary somewhat but overall if you're buying in the same town you'll probably end up with a similar return by the time you want to move again whichever house you buy."
"Some will have short, sharp busy periods (not always when you may expect them) that make up for a lot of missed trade at other times. There is a curry house near my folks that I'd always wondered how it keeps going ... then want past mid-afternoon on a Sunday and it was packed. Weird.

&gt; Or are they just a front for something more nefarious......?

*maybe*"
"Way too much to consider. A lot of your points are valid, but I'd almost certainly double, maybe triple, my earnings overnight which negates a lot of negatives. I know someone who only came back because his wife couldn't get a job in her chosen profession but even so, they had more cash than they knew what to do with.

I wouldn't move because I'd miss my family and friends, but objectively I'd definitely consider it. It's a cool place and I enjoy going over there.

You also have to remember that it's absolutely huge and moving to NYC is a world away from moving to Alabama."

"The mistake you made was telling them you're the right person. 

If you keep saying 

""I don't own a car, never been in an accident, I'm 15 years old"" they'll start dropping you from their databases.

"I have that choice; I've been married for over 15 years to an American, so could easily get a green card.  But we've never done so, partly because she's an Anglophile anyway but also because from my point of view America is too ... well, foreign. I've obviously spent a lot of time over there and apart from the fact that they speak the same language it's otherwise a completely different culture. Whereas oddly enough most parts of Europe I've gone to have much a similar way of life to Britain."
"Speaking as a person of Chinese ethnicity, I think Chinese food is rather badly suited to takeway (or the all-you-can-eat buffet where the food sits around and gets cold). A lot of obvious things e.g. crispy beef, decay between coming out of the wok and getting home to your plate, and others e.g. sizzling things, are meaningless. 

But possibly:

Aromatic Crispy Duck.

Beef black bean sauce green peppers.

General Tsang's Chicken.

MaPo Tofu.

Hot and Sour Soup.

"Yes it happens, but it's a pretty bleak view of the world to think everyone's out to con you. If you're willing to give someone the money, then you've not been tricked or taken advantage of. 

IMO, it's not worth punishing every genuinely needy person in the world by assuming they're a con artist out to get you. But yes to answer your question it is definitely a thing, but when you see some guy out in the frost in January wrapped in a shitty old blanket at 2am, it's probably not a thing. "
