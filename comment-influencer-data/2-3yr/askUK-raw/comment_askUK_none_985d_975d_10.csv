"Hello there.

I see you are requesting information about controlled substances.

Are you planning to import controlled substances into the United Kingdom?

Please reply promptly to avoid investigation.

"You can get them on the black market fairly easily, but supermarkets won't stock them. Kinda like alcohol in the UAE. But if you're discreet and don't cause a fuss you can normally find a guy who'll sell you one. "
"To wash up in.  The bowl can be removed (with or without items) or filled with water (less water than the entire sink.)  It means you can soak items without blocking the sink entirely.

Furthermore, you can wear it on your head to parties and fashionable discos."
You guys are dicks.
"OP, if you're ever in the UK and a man comes up to you in the street and says he's ""from DelMonte, just say yes"".....then you say ""NO."" He's part of a group of pineapple importers. These guys are bad news, there used to be adverts on TV when I was a kid showing this guy saying ""Yes"" to Pineapple and other contraband fruit. "
People have a burning desire to get there...?
You have my sympathies.
"The problem with this, the irony even, is that what comes with a great pub is too many customers to be a great pub.
Heaven forbid your once perfectly acceptable local starts doing brilliant, reasonable priced food, has comfy arm chairs in an oak panneled room in front of a roaring real fire, masterfully kept real ale on tap, a barman who makes award winning cocktails, a massive south facing garden complete with babbling brook for long summer evenings, the worlds best free jukebox, the worlds best landlady, a friendly cat called tiddles and everyone knows Radiohead often drink in there.
This is a pub that's too noisey, too expensive, has tourists and students, you can't get a seat - let alone a table, takes ages to get served, a pub that busloads of lads come miles to for a Saturday night fight. This is a pub where you have to queue to use the gents - aka a really horrible pub experience.  
 This is why a 'great' pub should have no obvious redeeming qualities, and should probably be explicitly off-putting to the majority.
A 'scary' appearance can help, as can distugusting toilets and dirty-outdated decoration, but is by no means necessary. 

It's certainly a mysterious fine art.

"
"Of course you are! You'll need to do something regarding things like National Insurance and you may be subject to further taxation depending where your funds are so I suspect you'll have to do self assessment.

But yes, you can fill in forms as retired if that accurately describes you. Or, if it's easier, why not simply declare self employed :) 

The only thing I'll say, without details, given your questions it kind of implies you've lucked out somewhere along the line. Nothing wrong with that, but the rest of your life is a potentially LONG time - please please make sure youve taken professional advice regarding your money as you need literally millions to retire at this point.

Congrats though, if so."
"No, Pineapple is a controlled substance, a Class P drug.

Unlawful possession of a pineapple carries a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison (though first offenders usually escape with a caution).

However, it is legal to buy (and eat) pineapple slices in tins.

Suspicion of being a pineapple dealer automatically allows the authorities to search your property and subject you to the strongest surveillance.

You may have heard of the new Snoopers' Charter. That was mainly introduced to stop illegal trade in pineapples.

If you are visiting the UK, under no circumstances bring any pineapples in your luggage.

Resistance to these unjust laws led to the formation of the Pineapple Liberation Front.

here is a picture of their headquarters. in Scotland

"Being older than most here I remember a time when pineapple used to be available almost everywhere. Since the terrible events that happened in the late seventies though, you can barely even mention the fruit any more. Sad, but entirely necessary in my opinion."
"&gt;where would you go

"Live in London.

See her regularly, she shops at fortnum and mason but does her quick shops at the mini waitrose in Belgravia.

Only seen her twice at the cinema in the 30 years I've lived here"
Like London but dirtier
"You've just touched on a sensitive subject for us that's all. We try to forget about the glory days of when pineapples were thrown around like loganberries  casually are today, such is the heartbreak it stirrs to know we will never again taste the sweet apple nectar of the pine."
I've never paid to have a marrowfat pea on my face
"If you go during daylight hours, it won't be frowned upon. Anywhere that serves food, no problem at all. After about 7.30pm, a lot of places require/request that everyone must be over 18. Not all places though.

You will find country pubs much more welcoming, friendly and enjoyable than inner city pubs."
I'm a proud midlander. The south is full of wankers the north full of twats! The Midlands is full of down to earth people with decent jobs that make sense like building jet engines or trains! So to answer the question when thever purge starts I'll site withe the north till we've destroyed the south then turn on my former allies.
Either way.
"Pineapples used to be available in the United Kingdom, but only if you were royalty or seriously wealthy.  They cost a mint to import and preserve; most people would spend years saving in order to buy a pineapple.

An entire industry sprang up in the early Victorian period dedicated to, essentially, embalming pineapples so that they would last longer than a week or two on display.

As a demonstration of precisely how much we liked Pineapples, James II declared that St Pauls Cathedral would feature pineapples rather than crosses on the finials of the western towers:

[The towers in question](http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/24ef1d6b16b14b86b8b9b7f6b80830a2/saint-pauls-cathedral-west-tower-detail-b6e3mf.jpg)

In the second world war, however, pineapples became black market currency and were confiscated by the police on sight.  Post-war they continued to be confiscated, because the sight of a pineapple caused great distress to veterans and survivors who had had to sell literally everything they owned in order to obtain pineapples in order to interact with the black market which was the only way to get medicines, books and beer during the ration years of the 50's

A succession of Labour goverments, conscious of this stigma, enacted stricter and stricter measures controlling pineapples and ultimately declared them *fructus non grata* in 1973.

Since then, even the word pineapple has pretty much disappeared from normal parlance; using it makes youngsters look at you much the same way as if you called something 'hip' or 'groovy'.

As recently as last year, someone was arrested at Heathrow for trying to sneak some pineapple fruit juice concentrate into the country.  I recall he was sentenced to 10 years in HMP Merseyside.  Also, last week, an underground pineapple farm was found in Greenwich and shut down by the Police; apparently the pineapples were almost mature and had a street value of several million pounds sterling.

Basically, these days, unless you're the Queen or the Prime minister, you aren't getting a pineapple by legal means."
"I wouldn't recommend taking the risk as a tourist, however. Recently they've been doing the whole 'we'll let you off if you can help us catch 3 more pineapple consumers'. Remember that as class P, mere possession carries the same penalty as dealing."
"Since I have the memory of a true saddo, I am happy to say I remember an extensive discussion here 2 months ago:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/5b9toq/what_use_are_the_washing_up_bowls/

My answer was : 'My sink is made of a hard substance, so by having a plastic bowl, I do not chip crockery and break glass as I would if I had only the sink itself in which to wash up.'"
"Mate you need to chill out, nobody will care that you're Canadian. Just don't be a dickhead and you'll be totally fine."
"The main problem isn't the pineapple anymore, so much as all the synthetic pineapples that have come onto the market. A molecule tweaked here and there and suddenly it's legal. pineapples have been used as a remedy worldwide for centuries, but the long term effects of these new synthetic ones is unknown.

Some of the 'head shops' are selling fake pineapples for much less than a real black-market pineapple would cost, not that you could find an unadulterated black-market pineapple in any case.

So yes we do have them, but it's a complex and ongoing situation regarding legislation."
"There's only two types of milk. There's whole milk, and semi skimmed milk. There's this weird bottle of ghost piss they keep trying to pass as milk in shops too. Fuck knows why anyone would buy it."
"As someone a little older than the average Reddit demographic, who has attended crematoria rather more than I'd choose to, the reason is pretty simple. A crematorium is somewhere you tend to visit rarely, it's often a trip to a town you've not been to before, and you don't want to be faffing about with maps and phones trying to get there on time.   Signposting helps with all of that. They're also really busy, with lots of people going there every day."
"I don't think littering is getting worse but more that local councils are becoming increasingly bad at tidying up, probably because of budget cuts.

Some people just don't care and still throw things on the ground. Smokers are the worst for it because it seems acceptable, but it's not, to throw the finished fag on the ground."
"For planning purposes an opticians is a shop (use class A1), while doctors and dentists are non-residential institutions (use class D1) which explains why an optician won't primarily be in a converted house. Most towns have empty shops that an opticians can go in without having to make a planning permission application.

The generally lower use associated with a dentist compared to a GP's surgery would make it easier to get the change of use permission from C3 to D1.

But basically you can fit a dentists into a house more easily than a GP or an opticians."
"Yeah, haven't you heard about the new Digital Economy Bill? 

Read up on it, GCHQ really are very clever, I for one appreciate the UK government taking such diligent steps to protect me from saying or doing anything that may be wrong in their eyes."
"As an Australian who obviously lived on pineapple at home,  it was one of the first things I looked for when I got to the UK. I can confirm there is no pineapple to be found. "
"I honestly wouldn't worry about it. The fact that you seem self-aware enough to even be considering how best to not get on people's nerves is proof that you're probably decent. The dickheads are the ones who don't even realise that their behaviour is bothering other people.  
  
In my limited experience of Americans, they've all been delightful. The only thing I've noticed about Americans in general is how loud they are - some people need to moderate their volume a little bit ;)  
  
We're not too hard to please. Have fun!"
"Not really. It kind of transitions.

Towns and cities in the proper north of England resemble those in Scotland. For example, [Newcastle](http://hadrianswallcountry.co.uk/sites/default/files/Newcastle.jpg) doesn't look too different from places in Scotland. The scenery in the border region is similar, too. The scenery in the north of England merges into Scotland and the only real way you know you've crossed the border is that there's a sign to tell you so. There's no real hard border separated by a mountain or a river or something.

Even the accents transition. People in the far north of England often have a Scottish twang.

The same can be said for the English and Welsh border.

You will tell that you're in Northern England if you come in winter and you start to see people without coats on..."

"One thing I would suggest is to be careful with the whole ""I'll never need to work a day in my life"" thing. Having lots of money can make it easier to spend lots of money, and at 25 you still have probably another 60 years to go. While you don't need to work, it would not be a bad idea to use some of the money to invest in your own career development. "
"I disagree with some of the advice here, it rally varies from pub to pub. As a rule of thumb around 8-9pm for kids to leave is true, but if she is well behaved and quiet and it isn't a loud kind of pub most wont really be bothered. For Sunday lunch you'll see loads of families of all ages there.                           

&gt;  Are pubs welcoming to ""outsiders"" in general outside of the big cities 

Same as going to a cafe in a smaller town in NL. Most are friendly and welcoming places, you do still get the odd local only place where everyone turns to look at you as you walk in but you would be very unlucky to come across one. Most country pubs need tourist trade and food trade to survive. "
"Often when you notice this, it's because it's an American (or Australian or Canadian) advert, that they've redubbed with British voice actors (since that's cheaper than refilming a whole advert)"
"Yeah, it's if you are flirting with Pastafarianism but are not quite as holey."

"HMRC, have got under my skin recently.

Recently I got a letter threatening to take me to court because I had underpaid tax last year. (It was a follow up I missed the first letter as I was moving house.)

So two weeks of getting together various invoices, bills making sure everything is correct as obviously you dont want mistakes on a tax form.

I had underpaid my tax by 80 pence. It probably cost them more to chase it up. Fuck off and go after Amazon. "

"I work in a supermarket stacking shelves. Do you know what? I don't know if I enjoy it. It's easyish work, especially for someone like me who struggles with a lot of tasks that require any kind of brain power. The money's the best I've ever earned  - £10 an hour and so I can afford lots of nice things like books and dresses  - but people, especially on reddit (but also in real life) are so snobby about it. Reading bitchy comments about unskilled workers gets really fucking wearing all the time. Not everyone can go to university. Not everyone is competent enough to NOT stack shelves. This doesn't make them bad people, or someone to look down on to make yourself feel better. "
"That's not much less than the median household income in London and there's only one of you. Of course it's enough.
