"Man checking in

If it's a casual date, like ""for drinks"", you could get away with it.

If you've specifically invited her to dinner, book a fucking restaurant (not Nandos, Harvester, Beefeater or similar)"
Most people in the UK will have been taught cursive; pretty much none of us will call it 'cursive' (it's just 'joined up writing').
"I always win this. ALWAYS

It was about 4 years ago and I was on POF.

I matched with somebody nearby and after speaking for a few weeks and getting on really well I thought we should meet up, we arranged a date and a time and I said I would pick her up in my car.

She said something that seemed a bit out of the blue but I dismissed it initially, she said to me ""How big is your car?"" I told her it was a Corsa and she said ""That will be big enough."" Bit odd but she might just have not liked small cars. Over the few weeks we were talking I recognized her name but couldn't explain how exactly and thought it was just a happy coincidence as where I live isn't exactly a large town. We were getting on quite well and I didn't want to seem rude and ask her any questions that she may have already answered. So the date was set, I thought I may have known her and I was driving to meet up with her when I realised I knew her. She was the girl with spina bifida I went to school with who we called ""Count Cripula"" because she dressed like a vampire to school once.

I only realised this as I saw her on the pavement next to her house and I panicked, looked directly at her and drove off and back home, only then did I realise she was asking about the size of my car assuming I knew her and checking that her wheelchair would fit in my car. I was absolutely mortified and couldn't even look at my phone through fear of what she was going to message me saying.
As if things weren't already terrible enough one thing I didn't mention was her house was a typical English Terrace House, however to get to her front door you had to go up about 15 concrete steps. Of course she wasn't able to get up and down the steps and needed assistance from her Mum because of her terrible disability. So she would have needed to ask her Mum to help her down the stairs only for her 5 minutes later to have to call her and tell her the person she was going out with saw her, slowed down, realized she was in a wheel chair and driven off.

I am a horrible human being."

People generally have good experiences and respect the police. They are under funded and overworked.
"I'd think they were lacking in imagination or taste. You can find cheap and interesting restaurants in London, ones where they actually cook the food rather than blasting packets in a microwave. And if my date was broke then there are lots of options for a cheap afternoon/evening out:

* A wander around Holland Park followed by a picnic
* A visit to Hackney City Farm followed by a tea and cake at the cafe
* An afternoon playing games at the board games cafe, plus coffee and cake
* Spend Friday night drawing at National Portrait Gallery using the free supplies provided, following by a drink at the Chandos
* A slow walk along the Southbank, stopping in for ice cream or candied nuts
* Climb the Monument, then reward yourself for climbing all those steps with a coffee whilst sat in Trinity Square Gardens
* Go see some cheap (or free) comedy, followed by a pint
* Go to one of the many free museums, followed by a coffee

I'd rather my date used their imagination to find something interesting to do (and spend very little money in the process), than try to splash their cash at some flashy restaurant. 
"
Holy fuck mate that's the sort of memory that would pop out of nowhere into my head when I'm bored years later and make my ballsack shrivel out of long repressed shame.
"I'm shy and kind of reserved. I'm perfectly happy. I wouldn't assume she is unhappy at social gatherings based on this. I enjoy watching people having fun and still feel part of t even if I'm not the life and soul. 

It can also take a long time for reserved people to speak up in company. If that's her thing, it'll happen. 

If anything I'd get uncomfortable when people started overanalysing how I'm feeling about it. "
Biscuit packs that don't have the thin red line to peel the packet open. 
"My employers currently have over 100 unfilled positions paying over national minimum wage with reliable full-time hours (average worker does 40 hours a week)  

3-shifts, factory runs 24/7/364.  

We can't find the staff. Its not good work, it's hard work, it doesnt pay that well, the hours are awkward. we frequently get people refusing positions because we don't let people select their shifts.  If we were running the same roles with 9-5 5 days a week hours we could fill them.      

British people won't do these hours. Nor, it turns out, will a lot of immigrants do them either (about 80% of our workforce isn't even UK-born).   What's really comical is periodically, we all meet someone saying they just cant get work and will do anything.  I'm high-up enough in the business that I can go to HR and say *'give this person a job if they pass vetting'* so my response is always *'I can get you shift work paying above national minimum wage starting this week, and I can guarantee you full-time equivalent hours and as much overtime as you want at 10% markup.'*

Refusal rate so far is 100%"
"You've made a great start, just continue as you are and don't try to compete with others at your university. For a lot of them this will be the first time they have had money and will no doubt spend a load in the first few weeks on unnecessary things, you can quietly know that they will be struggling towards the end of term whilst you've been budgeting sensibly. "
Sarcastic and irreverent.
"Some will. Others won't. You are adults now, and by and large adults think people crowing about having cool clothes are wankers. Plenty of folk will be on a budget similar to you without any experience of budgeting. "
"It's available, but it is by no means popular. I think it's absolutely dreadful, personally. It tastes like carbonated 'Deep Heat' muscle cream. "
"*Maths* is singular in British English, not plural. We wouldn't say ""maths are interesting"", we would say ""maths is interesting"".

That aside, British English does have a bit of a preference for mass nouns where American English prefers count nouns. British people *pay their tax* and eat *mashed potato* and play *sport* but Americans *pay their taxes* and eat *mashed potatoes* and play *sports* and so on. So someone using *coin* as a mass noun where an American would would use the count noun *coins* is not unusual.

*Sea Parks* is probably a play on the name *Center Parcs* (a Dutch holiday company) and various sea life centres, so I wouldn't use it as an example of normal British grammar."

"First things first, will the company either support and sponsor the appropriate visa, or do you otherwise have the right to work in the UK?

you still need above min wage when its averaged. employer breaking law.
"We're a country where ""Always Look On The Bright Side of Life"" by Monty Python was the most popular funeral song in 2014 (and it's still in the top 10) and ""Another One Bites The Dust"", ""Highway To Hell"" and ""Ring of Fire"" (for cremations) are common choices - finding the funny side in even the bleakest of situations is what we do."
"No. Things aren't the same as they were when your mum was looking for work. Apply via the methods the company promotes. If you've already applied it won't help, and could even harm your application."
"Many moons ago one of my babies died, heartbreaking and extreme, while dealing with the grief, I was asked to lend support to another parent who had just had a baby die, it turned out there were no support groups in this part of the country, so I started one by accident, as I kept getting asked to help others, the first few of us were meeting informally, and for what ever reason we had called ourselves the Dead baby club, as you had to have one to be in it, it never occurred to us that anyone else would have any thoughts on this, eventually we had to come up with a more acceptable title as midwives, health visitors and doctors who were desperate to off load grieving parents need an acceptable name.  For those of us in the group it was matter of fact, to anyone outside the understanding of the process it was abhorrent. 

I think that we like to directly address elephant in the room, and don't shy from the dark or cringeworthy it may get.  "
"They offered a contract, you accepted it, it's tough shit for them if they didn't offer you the contract they meant to."
"I'm related to Lloyds staff. The aggression is probably down to the individuals you dealt with, but I do know that Lloyds are pushing their staff to get people to use the automated paying-in machine instead of a teller, presumably with the intent of phasing out the physical staff so they can make their managers richer. 

Part of me wonders if your particular branch is taking it to the overly-extreme end of things to get people to use the machine, but then maybe they're just twats and it turns out their twattishness comes in handy."
Wheely badly
"Well I'm resolutely middle class and I've worn football and cricket shirts on holiday because they're comfortable.  Shocking.  Most places you go on holiday are hotter than the UK, and a short-sleeved, highly breathable shirt is a great thing.

There are also some people who basically want to go on holiday to the UK, but with better weather.  You see a lot of these in Spain.  It's quite sort of comforting to be able to order English food and not worry about a language barrier, but it's not really travelling.  It will not broaden the mind or soul.  But not everyone wants to be broadened."

"The largest supermarket chain in the UK. Their products are nothing special; they're a very mid-range, jack of all trades supermarket."

"By society at large they're well respected. They generally pursue a policy of talking and de-escalation. Obviously there are certain sections of society that hate the police, but usually that will reflect more on them and theirs rather than reflecting badly on the police.

Nothing's perfect and neither are the police. However, I can truthfully say that in this respect, I can look at other countries and be genuinely glad that we have the police force we do."

I went on a Nandos date once because I told her I'd never been so she saw it as her duty to teach me the ways.
"I was never told it was called cursive. We called it joined up writing. 

I seem to remember we were taught it at the age of nine. It's basically all I remember doing for one school year. We had notebooks with the guidelines and had lots of repetitive practice and homework. But I think that may have just been one teacher that was obsessed with it. She was also obsessed with square dancing so we did that in lots of PE lessons. 

Essentially, I was expected to have joined up writing in junior school but nobody cared once I got to high school. I quickly stopped joining the letters together."
Hope you glassed the cunt.
"I think there should be a set of standard T&amp;C terms which have icons to represent them. Like how PEGI ratings for games have icons representing the reasons why it has that rating (e.g. ""Violence"", ""Bad Language"", etc).

So for example there would be an icon that tells you they will pass your data onto 3rd parties, one that tells you they take ownership of whatever you upload, and so on.

It wouldn't replace the full T&amp;Cs, it would just be a summary. And there would probably have to be an icon that says there are some non-standard terms in there."
"I met someone who made me cry on the first date. He was incredibly rude, really judgmental. He'd spent the whole week before sending me really sweet voice messages and videos acting like he was an absolute darling, sat down with me on the date and from the start like he was better than me. He was rude, arrogant, dismissive, anything I said he took as a personal attack including ''I really like your jacket''

 He kept insisting he was having a good time even though he moaned and grumped through the whole thing. I tried my hardest but it was genuinely exhausting trying to get him to be nice, it was so amazingly hard that my eyes just started filling up and I had to excuse myself. So disappointing. It was like Jekyll and Hyde. 

He then had the nerve to text me afterwards saying he thought I was the nicest sweetest person he'd ever met and I was like ''are you fucking kidding me?'' "

"5x8 is fine for day work.  But as soon as you factor night work in it's more complex.  My father did 5 night-work days for a long time and it was a complete killer, he's moved to 4 night-work consecutive days now and he says it's a *lot* better.

Edit:  And   there's basically no public transport at night in many areas, which is a pain in the arse."

"The reason rootbeer isn't popular is because of the wintergreen in it.  Over in the UK at least, this is only used in muscle cramp and disinfectant creams (ralgex and germolene)  so the taste of it is almost universally unappealing. 

When McDonalds arrived in the 70s they served root beer for a while but took it off the menu as no-one was buying it.  There are some people who like it but most of us associate the taste with either horrible medicine or muscle cramps so don't drink it.

I have seen it for sale in the US section of my local supermarket."
Not unusual. Would be rare to ask you to prove it.
"Eggheads are masters in general knowledge, questions like ""Who hosted BBC Radio Merseyside in 1972"". 

University Challenge asks academic questions like ""Which french chemist discovered element 63 in the periodic table"".

As for who knows more stuff, probably the Eggheads by a small margin as their job is literally to know as much as possible. 


I think the best quiz would be between the eggheads and The Chasers, I'd pay to watch that.  "

"I know this won't help your situation, but just because you see people out drinking it doesn't mean they arn't suffering from depression. I used to go out and drink every night, taking drugs etc etc. I didn't realise at the time, but I was suffering from depression and used alcohol and drugs as a way to forget. It was only when I stopped drinking and began a bit more of a normal routine that I realised. Just because somebody looks happy with lots of friends in photographs you don't know whats going on in their heads.

Good luck, self employment is hard, but can definitely be worth it."

"British people getting obsessed by US politics and following the ins and outs of it. Yes Donald Trump is an arse, but is that his press secretary resigned or the state of healthcare reform in the US really as newsworthy as things that happen here that actually affect British people?
