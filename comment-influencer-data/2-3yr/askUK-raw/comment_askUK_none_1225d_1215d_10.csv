"Usual etiquette is you agree to split evenly. 

Then Susan, says rather loudly to nobody in particular ""Oh, that's fine. Though I didn't actually have a drink. Or a starter. but okay, if that's what everyone thinks""

So, it's agreed that Susan will just pay for her main.

Then Simon says ""I didn't have a starter or a dessert""

And then Stuart says ""I had beer and a cocktail, it's only fair I pay a bit more, really I insist""

This goes on for half an hour until everybody is happy (i.e. seething inside)

Yes, the restaurant will take from cards individually. When all that is done and the waitress adds it up she'll tell you you're still £3.50 short and the chump who is left lingering fishes that out of their pockets in cash."

"It's cheap, warm and it's called plasteboard and you need some approprtiate plasterboard fixings.

But if I am wrong and it is digestives put the kettle on, i'm coming over."
"It's Pancake day.

Some people make pancakes. For many, it's the only time of year they do.

That's basically it unless you're Christian."

Probably the closest except Louis is much less political and a far better documentary maker.
"Lorries often flash you to let you know it's safe to go back into the slow lane after overtaking. Not that useful if you're going fast in a car, but a godsend if you are in something a bit bulkier or without a rear view mirror. They could have been doing that? "
No. *Nobody* should be expected or obliged to donate to charity.
CAMRA have run a very successful promotion campaign for around 40 years to get sales of real ale back up to where they were before continental style lagers became popular.
"Difficultly in pronouncing the English language in a coherent manner.

I kid, I like them both."
"By English standards, Alton Towers is NOT near London, but Thorpe Park is."
"This isn't so much ""swapping"" as it is two different things.

The first is *rhoticity.* Rhotic accents always pronounce ""r"" sounds. These accents are found in Scotland, Ireland and most of the USA and Canada. Non-rhotic accents only pronounce the ""r"" when it's before a vowel, such as your ""wata"" example. These accounts are found in England (with some exceptions), Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

The other thing you've noticed is called *r-intrusion.* This is a feature that some non-rhotic speakers have.

"It's the time when we celebrate the life of the great St Pancake, the patron saint of clumsy steam roller drivers. 

In the UK we like to celebrate by rolling the village idiot up in a giant pancake, throwing lemon juice and sugar in their eyes, and throwing them down a steep hill. "
"Nobody will give a stuff about any of these. He will be seen as American, not as Hispanic-American. Even a Martian-American will be seen as an American, not a Martian.

He can wear what he likes; it will be seen as 'what Americans wear'- those teams won't mean much here. We think of MLS as where European footballers go to retire. NHL isn't that much followed here.

However, he will get stick if he calls it soccer. Tell him NOT to do that."
"It's not a peculiarity of the area, because I also come from North London and I only partially agree with you.

If a *person* was described as Asian, I would assume it meant someone from the Indian subcontinent.

If *food*  was described as Asian, I would assume it could be any part of Asia, without anything more specific being included.

"There will be plasterboard, a gap, then brick. Either get some really long masonry screws, or get plasterboard fixings. If you're like me, you will then enjoy hours of frustration because NYLON FUCKING PIGTAILS ARE SO SHIT AND FUCK NOW I HAVE MASSIVE HOLES IN WALL FUCK WHY DID IT JUST COME OUT OH SHIT THE FUCKING THING WONT GO IN ANYMORE

I've had some bad times with nylon pig tails. I'd suggest metal."
I find it helps if you sing the theme to *Goldfinger* when walking along. How many bottles of windscreen washer fluid did you end up buying?

"People go to gyms and pools to do their own stuff, not find people to pick on.  Those places exist for people to get fit in, they are *for* people like you. Just go and enjoy yourself.

And start paying attention to what you eat NOW. There's no reason to wait, eating healthier now will help you with your exams. Make you feel better about yourself, more fruit, veggies, less fat and carb - better nutrition, better ability to concentrate."
"Back then people were just as full of shit as they are now. You owe the money, stop being a dodgy fucker and trying to avoid it. 

Living outside the UK has no affect on your student loan. It's a 30 year thing regardless of where you live."

"Not actually on my CV....

Back in the days when applying for a job involved actually going to meet a job agent in person, my agent asked me what I was earning. I told him £26k (which wasn't true, I was actually on £24k).

""£26k? Is that all? Any interviews you go to, tell them you're on £28k. We should be able to get you at least £32k.""

So I did what he said. A few weeks later, he'd found me a job earning £35k."
"Yes, I think Canadians are different to Americans.

"Absolutely, Canadians are our Commonwealth friends, Americans are also nice but they are weird."
"To be fair it's hard for those from the UK to suggest what you will personally want to wear, when we are as unaccustomed to your climate as you are to ours.

I'd say bring a rain coat, a jumper as well but leave the thermals at home. 

To give you some idea over a 30 year period the average high temperature in London was 20.7c and the average low was 11.5c for the month of June. The daily mean was 18.3c.

 What you will find is that if you are used to fairly consistent and stable weather where you are from, you might be surprised to see how quickly the weather of the UK can fluctuate. 

For example yesterday I woke up and it was cloudy, within 30 minutes it was beautiful sunshine, but at lunch time it was pissing rain and very windy. By 4pm it was lovely sunshine again.

I personally think you'll be fine with a rain coat and a sweatshirt.

Enjoy your trip. "
"To quote Terry Pratchett &amp; Neil Gaiman from ""Good Omens"":

&gt;""Note for Americans and other aliens:  Milton Keynes is a new city approximately halfway between London and Birmingham.  It was built to be modern, efficient, healthy, and, all in all, a pleasant place to live. Many Britons find this amusing.

Essentially, it was one of the first cities to be designed rather than to grow organically, and was largely designed to a coherent single plan. This gives it a very different geographical character to other UK cities (similar to the Garden Cities, but more so). It seems to lack any sort of history or character that other towns and cities have.

Similar criticisms are made of the other New Towns; Crawley, Stevenage, Harlow and the like. However, Milton Keynes represents the pinnacle of the style."
"Being homosexual wouldn't disqualify someone from being the monarch.

If that monarch had any legitimate children, the throne would pass on to them after death. If they didn't, it would pass on to their nearest relative (i.e. if we're talking about Prince George, it would pass on to Princess Charlotte or her children)."

'Better than Slough and Grimsby' isn't a ringing endorsement. It's like saying 'cholera is better than ebola and smallpox'
Qualifications that you have bought are worthless. There is zero chance of you getting a research position if you have one of them: you'll get laughed out the door. 
"As far as I know, the authorities would only be informed by a counsellor/psych/doctor if it were thought that people are still at risk.

Whoever enters first. You always give way to the cars already in the roundabout.
You sure they flashed and didn't just go over a bump in the road that made it appear they had?
"Not seen this suggested:

Take your negotiated pay, and pay it into a bank account as normal. Shuffle some into savings, pay your bills, act natural. Then, when it comes to payday each month (or whenever) all you do is pay your fair share of tax like you're supposed to you entitled money-grubbing prick. "
"Its the beige of the UK, extremely bland/unimaginative.

"Unfortunately not, after Prince Philip called them 'slit eye chinks' in 1992 the English and the Chinese have essentially been at trade stoppage.

You won't find anything made in China directly imported to England.

This is one of the reasons Scotland wanted to break away and a reason that many Brits want to stay in Europe so we can buy things from China from the European mainland.

Similarly you won't find anything English in China, they won't have full English, they call it 'American breakfast' you won't find British institutions like British Home Stores or Woolies or Argos."
Whoever is driving the Audi.
They usually come under 'soft drinks' or 'fizzy drinks'. Or we just say lemonade/coke/fanta and then they'll give you sprite or 7up or whatever kind of lemonade they've got.
"I went to see QI about 9 years ago. The filming ran for about 2-2.5 hours and it was basically just a really long episode of the show. They didn't pause at all.

At the end, they had to refilm some tiny bits where the sound quality was poor, but it was literally just ""Can you say that line again?"", not reshooting whole segments. "
"I would say that in the English-speaking world, Americans and Aussies seem the most different of any country.

Brits can relate to both on a fairly good level, we all have the same core values as societies and similar systems of rule, but they are very different people. The Australians are irreverent and enjoy shock humour where Americans can often be very literal and easy to take offence."
