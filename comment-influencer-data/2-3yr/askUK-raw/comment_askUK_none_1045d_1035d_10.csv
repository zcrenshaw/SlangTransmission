This is a blatant breach of the data protection act.  I'd consider talking to the information commisioners office and taking it from there.  Just make sure you explain the situation to your boss and get something from him in writing confirming the conversation with the recruiter took place if you can.
"It's a self-fulfilling cycle.  Big companies go where the talent and infrastructure is, and talent goes where the big companies are.

Unless you have one major industry - banking, civil service, journalism etc - that moves en mass to another city things will never change.

We opened an office in Bangor (North Wales) a few years back but we just couldn't attract the right amount of talented staff from the local area... we re-located it to Sheffield and had our pick of really good recruits.  Banks etc will take the same view - why open in Manchester or Newcastle when they can guarantee the pick of ~~internal~~ international talent by locating themselves in London."
"Aah the British colonial tradition is alive and well.

No it's absolutely fine unless you are taking the piss and paying entirely in 5ps or some such

Sounds like harassment if they're continuing to approach after being told you aren't interested. Report it to the council. You could also ring the Daily Mail and tell them there are some fundamentalists harassing people about saving them.

"From [Understanding Your Pay](https://www.gov.uk/understanding-your-pay/deductions-from-your-pay) on the government's website:

Your employer can't deduct your pay unless you've agreed to it in writing and they can't deduct more than 10% of your gross pay in any one pay period to cover shortfalls.

They say that if you haven't been paid properly then you should try and speak to your employer first and if that fails then you should contact Acas or Citizens Advice."

"When people talk about places having a ""secret menu"", what they usually mean is ""a way to irritate the employees by requesting substitutions"". Like, a daft friend of mine (who never uses soap and who shared a bed with his sister on a recent family holiday to Crete, but that's another story entirely) sometimes has the poor sod behind the till in McDonalds add a chicken burger and a fillet o'fish to his Big Mac and claims it's a ""secret menu"" item. He calls it a ""land, air and sea burger"" which is a deceptive name, since chickens don't fly in the air - and even if they did, expect McDonalds chickens are lucky to even see sunlight during their lifetimes. "
Slightly off-topic but when the fuck did we start having Proms?
"This reminds me of when I used to be scared of the Doctor. He'd say ""What's up then little fella?"" and I'd shyly look at my Mum who would tell the Doctor what I'd told her earlier.

You ask for their secret menu and they point you to the nearest place that sells food actually fit for human consumption.

That sounds like a remarkably good idea to every guy in every movie who inevitably gets his face clawed off. I might pass.

"Step 1 - get legal advice.

Step 2 - follow legal advice.

Legal advice is expensive, but it's far cheaper than potentially getting screwed. But you must keep a close eye on your solicitor to check *he* doesn't screw you. He will charge you for every phone call, every letter, and every half hour (or part) you spend with him.

Because of that, you should talk to your ex and agree between you, as far as possible, exactly what you are going to do. Ideally, get advice from your solicitor first about what might be reasonable (to ensure that neither one of you is asking for massively more - or less - than is reasonable), then speak to your ex without your solicitor because it's a) cheaper, and b) better for future amicable relationships with the mother of your child. Then, go back to your solicitor and ask him to do whatever needs to be done to put the agreement that you've already made into writing.

IANAL, but you will be expected to contribute to the upkeep of your child. The law has recently changed on how this works, and I'm not familiar with the details, but it encourages you and your ex to find an arrangement you're both happy with. If you can't do that, then whoever is the main carer of your child will be able to apply to have a decision made on your behalf, but you will both have to pay the authorities if it ends up going down this route.

You didn't mention maintaining contact with your child, so I don't know how high on your priority list that is. Again, if you can work out arrangements informally with your ex, and get them put in writing by your solicitor, that's great. If you can't, then you might want to check out [Families Need Fathers](https://fnf.org.uk/home) for support, and also for help which will be cheaper than your solicitor can offer you. You will not have any legal right to see the older child, but, once again, it may be that you can come to an arrangement about this which you're both happy with anyway.

Hope that helps. Good luck."
"No, you don't have any right. He has a right to privacy and if the police were to tell you anything they'd be breaking any number of ethical/professional codes. Just as an aside, me and my partner (both white) used to be foster carers and sometimes had black children placed with us. It does sound difficult for you so I don't mean to sound unsympathetic but that's the reality. "
"Secret menus sort of make sense when the food is made or at least assembled freshly for you.  

What the fuck are Gregg's going to do?  It's all pre-cooked.

""Anyone order from the secret menu today Doreen?""

""No, 2 dozen steak and marmite slices from the secret hot cabinet going to landfill again.  And the secret Nutella donuts we keep in the other implausible secret cake area, those too""."
"For a few quid once or twice a year it's just not worth the aggro.

"Yes, people like to have new sofas to show to their family.  It also means people justify the high prices as a 'Christmas purchase'.

"Oh do fuck off.

Edit: Nice edit. It originally said ""We're taking our country back"" or some other shite."
"I don't know if this is against the spirit of ask UK.

But for god's sake. They are both huge cities which are absolutely fine to spend a year in. Show some initiative and research skills and make your own decision. Geez. Neither one is really better than the other."
"As you've put ""in this country"" I feel obliged to point out this is one of the best countries in the world to drive in. One of the safest too. 

Go to Poland or Russia or almost anywhere, even in Western Europe then claim the UK is bad.  It's bloody brilliant and one of the best things about the UK.

I'm not kidding. 

This doesn't stop the UK having morons and idiots of course, but if you want to consider ""this country"" then frankly, we are angels. 

Perhaps you have road rage issues?"
"My main issues are:

1 - the warrantless access of internet connection records by not only the police but several dozen other organisations - even ones like the Charity Commission. What business of theirs is it what you browse?

2 - the fact that the databases used to store internet connection records will undoubtedly be hacked since they will be a treasure trove of information.

3 - you will be paying more for your internet and mobile services, for the privilege of getting spied on and having your data stored in a probably insecure fashion.

4 - it is likely to be ruled illegal by the European Court of Human Rights as soon as it gets there, just like several other similar schemes by other countries were.

5 - the ""I have nothing to hide"" rationale. If you have nothing to hide, would you mind if I looked at you while you're taking a dump? Would you give me your passwords too? It's like saying ""I have nothing to say"" therefore you don't need freedom of speech.

6 - it's entirely unnecessary. The people who the hacking, monitoring etc. are aimed at will know how to get around it so that little or no useful data is stored about them. If the police, by contrast, went back to proper neighbourhood policing, this would all be irrelevant.

7 - the ""double lock"" on intrusive hacking or surveillance is a fallacy. In reality it just means the judges rubber stamp the warrants as long as the paperwork is filled out correctly.

8 - what happens when all of these rights and data pass on to a dictatorial regime? What if an organisation like Isis came to rule and found you were visiting gay porn sites (not saying you do, but just imagine it)?

While you might not care about any or all of these, I do and that's why I'm being very careful about my online activity from now on, by using the safest VPN I can get, that's based in a foreign country."

Just trying to advance the narrative dude... It's stalling and we need a jump-scare or something to keep us interested... 
Christmas day
Please keep calling the police. I was in an abusive relationship and never got any help from the outside. Call 101 and report that he came to your door and potentially threatened you. At least then it's on record.
"Because the vast majority of people are very simple and are easily preoccupied. 

Think about it, millions of people watch Geordie Shore and TOWIE and celebrity juice or whatever. The majority of our country voted for Brexit, a good amount of them not even knowing why but they just YOLO'd it. 

People are idiots. Not excusing myself from that, I'm just a different kind of idiot. One not into pop culture."

"London has to be one of the great places to live in the world.  Given your overall tone, I imagine you find nothing but depressing stories, because that's what you are looking for.

You can always live outside London and commute in.  Or you can just about still find affordable places near the centre.  A friend got a 2 bed flat in Walthamstow for Â£200k 3 years ago, which is on the Victoria line.  And while that's not cheap, he probably earns Â£15k a year more than if he lived elsewhere.

There is a genuine point though, that statistically the UK is sort of missing a second city.  We should according to the model of most countries have somewhere about 1/2 the size of London.  We don't and that does make things London-centric.  Having said that, because office space is so expensive here, no one keeps non-essential staff in London any more.  I'm typing this from the City of London where I work in insurance, and I can easily name big companies with offices from Bristol to Glasgow."

"I had something very similar happen to me recently... I applied for a job, turns out the director I was going to interview with used to work with my current director so he rang her for a reference *before I'd even met him*. Pissed me right off and I told him I had no plans to ever work for someone so sleazy.  
  
Short answer, no it's not allowed. It's a data breach. What was the recruiter even thinking by doing that?  
  
Let your boss know what happened and then send a very, very strongly worded email to the recruiter."
"Yeah, they're in those mixed tins.
