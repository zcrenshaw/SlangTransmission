"Really? Well how about 

For goodness' sake

Method in my madness

Neither here nor there

All's well that ends well

A wild goose chase

Too much of a good thing

As luck would have it

Waiting with 'bated breath' 

Not the 'be-all and end-all' 

Breaking the ice

Refusing to budge an inch 

Cold comfort 

Dead as a doornail 

A dish fit for the gods 

Faint-hearted

Foregone conclusion 

Things coming 'full circle' 

Good riddance 

Heart of gold

In my mind's eye

The idea of being 'a laughing stock' 

Love is blind 

One fell swoop

Playing it fast and loose

Wearing your heart on your sleeve 

Being 'in a pickle'

Being 'in stitches' laughing 

The words rant, puking, bedazzled, obscene, swagger, zany

Not slept one wink 

Lying low

The world's my oyster

The naked truth

My own flesh and blood 

All of a sudden 

Come what may 

Each and every one of those is a Shakespeare invention, and the list could have been a lot longer if my finger hadn't got tired. Whatever your opinion of his plays, you can't deny his contribution to the English language. I can't think of another individual who's had more impact on how we speak today. "
"Embedded so deeply in our culture that people are quoting him all the time without even realising it ""a rose by any other name""; ""Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.""; ""loved not wisely but too well""; ""if music be the food of love""  ""pound of flesh"" etc.

A teller of stories and characters that still have currency - Romeo &amp; Juliet still the go-to for teenage love, Lady Macbeth the model of an ambitious woman behind the scenes, Iago the evil schemer, etc

"&gt;Each and every one of those is a Shakespeare invention

We don't know that. He's the first person who is recorded using those phrases and words, but that doesn't mean he invented them. They could have been in common usage in spoken English at the time."
"I may agree on this. 

In Italy we all credit Dante by calling him ""the father of Italian language"", while he simply used the *vulgar* language, which was the spoken language commonly used in his time. Of course he did use it with skill, with reason and in the most appealing way, though."
I think we're beyond the point where there is any reasonable explanation for any of this. Sorry.

"My view is that if your dog doesn't come when you call it, it needs to be on a lead at all times in public.

If your dog jumps at people then you need to call it and keep it under control/on a lead when there are others in sight, ""Oh, s/he's only being friendly"" does not excuse jumping at people. This is not acceptable unencouraged behaviour, regardless of how clean they are.

You picking up your dog is your decision and nothing to do with anyone else (unless I suppose you do it in some way that is harmful to the dog). I suppose it depends how far you took losing your temper (i.e. nothing wrong with telling them which it seems like that is all you did), but your opinion certainly seems alright."

"None of the Leave camp were willing or popular enough to gain the support of the Conservative party, and/or able to stand up to the scrutiny required of the claims and promises they made during the campaign."
"It may be to do with the fact that the school leaving age is now this mess: https://www.gov.uk/know-when-you-can-leave-school

Basically, in a bid to cut NEET rates (not in education, employment or training) among young people our lovely government decided that 16 year olds are no longer allowed to leave school and get a job. They must now leave school and find some form of further education. Except unlike with school for 5-16 year olds, the local education authority is not obliged to find you a place, and hence no sixth form, college or training institution is obliged to take you on. If you fail your GCSEs, you're basically fucked, because most of these courses require at least a C in Maths and/or English. You're actually now not legally allowed to work full time under the age of 18 unless it's an apprenticeship, and you're not allowed to work part time unless you're also in training as well.

So, yep - you got it in one really. Employers get this sweet deal where they can suddenly employ 16-18 year olds for about £2 an hour while ""training"" them. The government gets a nice big fat reduction in unemployment rates since 16-18 year olds aren't actually allowed to work so can't be classed as unemployed. The teens in question get a qualification which isn't worth shit, and a job which is shockingly underpaid. Tories! Not just screwing immigrants any more.

The scheme would make sense if companies were forced to offer decent training and/or that training was actually transferable but in the fashion we've become accustomed to, it actually just makes no sense except on the budget sheets of CEOs and the stats sheets of the government."
"the issue with fox hunting is hounds were used to chase the fox across the countryside to the point of exhaustion then rip it apart.

game hunting happens with guns. "
"If I was in a room with a Tory politician, I'd keep a firm hand on my valuables too."
"Fox hunting in the UK stereotypically involves a load of posh people in fancy clothing prancing about on horses running after a pack of hounds with the actual fox bit being something of a sideshow. As such reasoned arguments about the necessity of controlling fox numbers and whether there are more humane ways of dispatching foxes get mixed in with a lot of class warfare and passions run high. 

Other forms of hunting don't attract nearly as much ire as fox hunting. They're not as popular a pastime as they are in the US because getting hold of guns is a right pain in the UK. Generally people don't mind grouse shoots or duck hunting because there's much less ceremony, the use of firearms vs a pack of dogs delivers much cleaner kills, and you can consume the quarry so it's thought of similarly to fishing.

Gravy is typically made with the meat juices that drip to the bottom of the pan when roasting and therefore some bits and pieces of meat fall in too. Alternatively if it's made with gravy granules then it won't.

"&gt;is there widespread participation in hunting related sports

No.

Hunting is generally looked down upon as backwards and a little medieval, particularly by those that live in urban/suburban areas.  

I personally consider hunting for sport somewhat psychopathic."
"If I like you enough to get near your cock, I'm not going to care whether it's been circumcised.

Plus, so few males are circumcised I bet most women don't really know what one looks like in the wild. "
"Yeah pretty much, my teenage years(a few years ago) back in Kent was very similar. I knew a ton of Jays. And here's something pretty funny. When I first started secondary school, my dad bought me a briefcase to use. I was proper proud of it, thinking it would make me appear sophisticated. Nobody else thought so, and I was taken the Mickey out of for the two weeks I had it. Tired of the mocking, I used my own money to get a new bag. Took a while to shake off that reputation. I'm sure if the inbetweeners was on back then, I would've been called the 'briefcase wanker', haha."

"None of them expected to win the referendum and most of them did not want to. 

It was originally a cheap electoral ploy by David Cameron (2013) to try to stop UKIP stealing his voters (in 2015), and written into the 2015 manifesto with the expectation that the Tories would not get an outright majority but end up in coalition with the Lib Dems again. The referendum and the more vicious cuts were in the manifesto as bargaining chips with their more socially progressive, pro-EU coalition partner.

When they won the election they had to go through with the referendum. Osborne did delay some of his vicious cuts, now also mandated by the election, to try to avoid some of the damage that would do to the Remain vote, but the British political and media establishment live in a very blinkered bubble. There's a near perfect parallel story here with what has happened with Trump in the US. Ridicule to disbelief to anger from the commentariat when the voters completely upended their version of reality. 

It's the voters who got it wrong, in both cases, of course. (Don't get me wrong, I'm no fan of Trump, but I don't think you can defeat populists by telling the plebs to shut up whilst the grown-ups talk).

So, anyways, we ended up with a result that no one in the British establishment thought possible because no one in the British establishment has considered it necessary to listen to the voters for decades and the media only reports what it can see from its London-based windows.

What happened is roughly this:

- right-Brexit screamed ""immigrants"" and right/liberal-Remain screamed ""racist!"" back

- left-Brexit and left-Remain both got largely ignored by the media

- right-Remain preached economic prosperity as the reason to Remain, whilst somehow forgetting that we've had 6 years of pointless austerity which has driven millions to the brink. I think the straw that broke the camels back was Osborne promising even more vicious cuts to make up for Brexit if it happened.

Now Osborne has used the excuse to abandon his always idiotic economic policy, whilst pretending it is because of Brexit and not because he's an idiot. And the liberal/right-Remainers are busy declaring all Leavers racists, because apparently the best way to tackle the newly brazen confidence of the racists is to insist that 52% of the country agree with them.

It's a horrible mess. I'll leave you with an article from a left-Brexiteer lest you allow our media to persuade you it's because we're all a bunch of Little Englanders, it's much, much more complex than that but the media gave no space to nuanced argument:
