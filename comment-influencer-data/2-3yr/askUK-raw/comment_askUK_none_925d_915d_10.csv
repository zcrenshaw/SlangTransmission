"In my experience (3 kids), labour on TV is nothing like labour in real life. 

My wife was 'in labour' for a good few hours before the contractions were close enough together to warrant going to the hospital, we rang them and they asked how far apart the contractions were.

When we eventually went, we put the bags in the car and I drove, nice and steady. We parked and walked steadily in. I then had all the stress of waiting for her to hurry up and push the things out while she ripped my hands apart with her finger nails, I guess she was in a little pain or something.

Few hours later I drove back home, no ambulance, no sirens and flashing lights, no rush, no drama.

Ambulances have much more pressing things to deal with than women dropping kids."
"Fantastic technology. Builds on the principles farmers have been using for thousands of years, but speeds up the process of developing foods that are more nutritious, disease resistant, or faster growing."

"The hysteria surrounding GM foods is frankly embarrassing and indicative of the shit state of education in this country and the general scientific illiteracy of a public who care more about celebrities than anything else. I mean, one third of my fellow countrymen believe in ghosts. 

Jesus Fuck. 

In addition, plant biotechnology was an area that our scientists were really leading the world in, and its effectively come to nothing.

Maybe with Brexit there is a chance that things will change.

"Especially if it's my Dad driving. When my Mum was pregnant with me he was stopped by the police for speeding, but they let him off because she was in labour. They tailed him all the way to the hospital just to be sure he wasn't lying.

Except he was lying, he was speeding because he was late for the Aberdeen-Rangers game. He parked at the hospital and got a wheelchair to wheel her in before they were satisfied and left. He made it on time, if that matters.

"I don't know about corporate, I worked in a franchise. We did what we wanted. No one cared as long as we sold a lot of phones. When I worked in CEX:

 - we had to come in at  dead on 9, but got paid from 9:30am

 - management and franchise owners had an agreement with local shoplifters. Some of them would lift a load of stuff from Tesco or HMV and hand a bag full of stock (usually stuff on the Most Wanted board) to the manager on the till nearest the door. He'd empty it under the counter. open sealed stuff and buy all the stock in. Even on days we weren't trading for cash, cash would be scraped up from somewhere for the thieves. 

 - we weren't allowed to buy in phones with water damage (red sticker on charging port on iphone 3/3g/4/4s) but sometimes phones would come back from our repair centre with the water indicator red. We were told to shut up and sell them. I tried putting a note on the receipt and got a verbal warning. 

 - Everything was done to prevent cash refunds. At least 5 times a day a customer would be yelling at my manager and he'd be yelling back IT'S REPAIR OR REPLACE! (it isn't) and there'd be long email threads from customers, to head office, to us...giving people the runaround, to do anything to prevent a cash refund. I knew of a few customers who had their phones replaces about six times, the original cost going down each time they replaced as time went on. (voucher refund to get new phone went back to current value usually)

 - we'd have a competition to pick the most awful music. We never played metal, but we'd put on it's ""peanut butter jelly time"" or ""rock the dinosaur"" about 4 times an hour. The music would be so loud, too. 

 - Sometimes I wouldn't get paid for a fortnight later than I was supposed to. 

 - Christmas eve 2014 we all got stinking drunk on the tills on some money that the supervisor had found inside a dvd box that got traded in. he quickly slipped it out of the case and into his pocket before the customer saw and bought a load of Gordon's gin and tonic/JD and coke cans.

 - zero hour contracts. 


 - if a customer traded in something with intimate pictures on it, those pictures would be stolen and passed round the franchise and further. Once it happened to a member of staff, the pictures of his girlfriend went as far as some London stores

 - Was not paid any overtime. If anyone had a problem with their till, we were all expected to stay until it was sorted. Or a customer that wouldn't leave. Or a problem with a customers phone or console that took us past 6pm. If you were serving them, you stayed.

 - If you made a mistake, it was taken out of your wages. That includes you showing a phone to a customer and them nicking it out of your hands. That would come out of your wages. If it took you below minimum wage, then tough shit. Most of the staff were teenagers who didn't know their rights. The franchise owner liked it that way. This was changed a few years later to a 3 strikes system. If you made 3 mistakes in the space of a couple of months (bought in an iphone 6 as a 6s, till was down Â£10, sold a xbox one as a 360, etc) then you'd be dismissed, never mind how long you'd been there. I hear this happened in my old store and somone appealed. Turns out you're not supposed to do that. They had to give him his job back as far as I've heard.

So, that's why CEX is like it is. No one gives a shit. "
"Tea.  Everywhere else it's all yellow Lipton bags and weird milk and the wrong sized cups, and that's even if you get a kettle.  I have spent an afternoon in a New York hotel room seeing if you could make tea in a coffee maker (findings:  you cannot.  I don't why they gave us teabags).  Nothing - nothing - beats that first cuppa when you get home."
"Do you often cook lentils? Sometimes the smell of lentils cooking reminds me strongly of marijuana. Might just be nostaligia, though. :)

I think the best approach would just be to say to the landlord, ""I'm really sorry this is happening, and I wish I could help, but I don't smoke cannabis, so it can't be coming from me. Please feel free to check in with me when the smell happens and we can try to determine what's causing it."" Taking an attitude of helpfulness with a confrontational person often diffuses their anger. "

"Why would this be illegal...?

The real question is why bother doing it for a profit of 21p per unit if you're not shifting huge amounts? 

Edit... I see... The XBL token is separate and you probably don't hand this over to the Game geezers... Thus you're up 21p + However much XBL costs to subscribe to for 3 months..."

"It wouldn't be internationally recognised since no country wants to set a precedent. 

UK government would likely suspend the Scottish parliament.

It would be a disaster for the independence movement since people would be terrified of the chaos that ideology would have appeared to cause."
"It has hardly any following in the UK. Although there are some, it's not an issue. There was a scare in the 90s where people believed that the MMR vaccine gave kids autism and because of this cases of measles went from about 50 to over 1,000, kids died and got seriously ill. I believe the report it came from was pretty much slated as murdering these kids.

But, on a whole, it's not talked about much. The most I hear about it is when British people are commenting on views in the USA."

"Why not trust the British? 

We'd argue Americans are the untrustworthy people. You carry guns because it's your right to kill people, and you elected a known bigot and a failure of a businessman as president, because this billionaire is ""one of the people"" but he's basically the most corrupt and stupid president in your entire history. 

And Brits are untrustworthy? "

"1) I'm in a government funded position that lets me develop my passions from home.

2) I collect unemployment."
"Do what is best for you.

Unemployment is not an ideal state.

Take the job, but while you are there, do your best in it for the 'extremely nice' people.'

It will then be win-win for everyone. 

The professional world is extremely cut-throat. The situation you outline is extremely mild."
"How little they go out drinking.  Pub culture in part used to be sustained for fogies like me by the youth pouring money into pubs on a Friday and Saturday night.

Now of course you can chat to people on social media and don't need to organise a pub trip on a Friday to catch up with your mates.

My mum used to tell me about how when she was young they didn't have a phone (as in landline - mobiles weren't invented then).  To organise meeting people they had to do it every time they saw them, turn up at their houses or write letters.  Imagine that!"
"How much they are willing to do things for free, and how little they are willing to accept.

I work with young people in my job, and I see volunteers coming in to manage entire events that I would expect an events manager or co-ordinator to charge hundreds of pounds to do. They don't realise that in the past, they would be getting paid, or at least given a gift by the host organisation for doing such things.

I often think these unpaid internships and the like are propaganda in a way; teach people that they are the way things should be, and the following generations will just take it as the way things have always been. I find it a little taking advantage because often these people who are volunteering are much better at doing such things than us paid staff! and yet they do it happily for free for no reward!

In a similar vein, graduates who don't apply for high(er) level jobs that they're perfectly qualified for, and are too shy to talk themselves up, because of all the rhetoric around graduates not being able to get good jobs and having to restart at entry level. Again I'm not speaking for myself, but what I've seen in others. The cynic in me feels that these messages sent out are deliberate to keep the market for those jobs less cluttered. The people who pushed for a super-educated generation of young people in practice now also want to keep them in their place; admitting your own relative lack of education or skills is I think difficult. Even I find it difficult all while being impressed at how smart the young people I work with are compared to me at that age - or now!"
"A friend of mine lived in Kentucky and had this Fox-instilled fear that London was controlled by ISIS and that she would be beheaded live on TV. 

After she got here, she realised this is the best city on the world and didn't want to leave, much to the dismay of her parents. 

The point is, your media is rampant and uncontrolled which means they lie to get views. 

The answer is, you're very very unlikely - I'd say no more than you would in your own home town. 

The fact that you know the language obviously will help you become a part of your community a lot more quickly and easily which means meeting new people, making friends and generally a more safer environment as you quickly assimilate what's around you. 

There aren't criminals waiting in vans around the corner to kidnap you. Crime will happen anywhere you go, and I'd say you're safer in the UK than pretty much most other countries. 

That and no guns.  "

If you look around the shed, not sure which one... but one of them, you'll find a stash of pogo sticks next to her roller boots and chopper bikes.

"Oh, we had so much fun. My best memory is my friend having pleurisy and as there was no sick pay she came in and was high on Tramadol the hospital had given her. She was trying to count up her till but just couldn't grasp it and sat down on the floor and fell over.  I laughed until I cried


we also used to hide from customers by all crouching under the tills. They'd come in and say ""hello?""  ""helllooo?""and all six of us would be quiet as mice pretending not to be there, laughing silently, trying not to be heard"

"The US market is heavily flooded with all sorts of drugs, companies take a drug, make a minor change then spin it as a new drug.

Therefore, what's still perfectly effective to use for treatment today may seem ""archaic"" to Americans because in America drugs is a business - there's a new one every year.

If it works for you, then it works for you. Newer drug isn't necessarily better."

"There were King George VI (and probably earlier) coins still in circulation after decimalisation.

The old sixpence, shilling and 2 shilling pieces remained in general use with the values of 2.5p, 5p and 10p respectively.

The last to be withdrawn was the 2 shilling which lasted until 1992, when the 10p was reduced in size and weight."

"As long as they pass the same food safety regulations as 'normal' food, I'm not bothered at all.

Thinking about it, I'm not sure I actually routinely eat any food that hasn't been modified from it's original state. Wheat was selectively bred from a type of grass, same as rye and barley. Domestic pigs don't look much like wild boar, and I've never actually seen a wild chicken. Maybe vegetables are closer to their original forms, but I've only seen carrots that are orange, and nobody is going to convince me that apples naturally come in a fuck-tonne of differing varieties. 

I don't see any real difference in doing the selective breeding on a farm or in a lab, just that one of the methods is a lot quicker."
