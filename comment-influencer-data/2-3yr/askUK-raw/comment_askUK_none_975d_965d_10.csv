They are SO BEHIND it's ridiculous. They've only just introduced contactless at their tills 

Their PCs were using Windows XP until last year - when they upgraded to Windows 7.

They used Office XP until 2016, when they upgraded to 2010.

Their internal systems all use the old DOS/PuTTY based systems, so you can't use the mouse.

Instead of buying a custom application for labour matching, they got a guy to develop a spreadsheet and rolled that out across the business - it's all done on Excel with a few macros, with absolutely no flexibility built in.

They literally post out ""a blue book"" to every store with regards to their budget instead of emailing it - and the budget goes up every year, even when sales go down. They use this tactic to refuse end of year bonuses - the maximum of which is 3% for non-management staff - and 1 of those is if the entire company meets the sales bonus, which it never will because they keep upping the targets.

They invest no money in technology and give no forethought about future proofing anything.

"Yes, she is banned. The exact phrase is:

&gt;I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of [aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12)] for 90 days from the date of this order ...

~~Realistically I'm not sure there's a way for them to find out she's an Iranian citizen if she's using her British passport. However, on the other hand,~~ I personally would not risk it given the current state of the US; and in fact they will probably tell her not to fly at this end just because of all the uncertainty. The absolute last thing you want is to be detained for hours by those immigration officials at the US border. Also IANAL.

Wait for more information. There will be court rulings soon, and I know Canada and Australia are seeking clarification for their dual citizens and I would hope and assume we are doing the same. It's a fucking shitshow.

**Edit (15:41, 29/01/17):**

Just in from the Press Association:

&gt;Prime minister Theresa May has ordered foreign secretary Boris Johnson and home secretary Amber Rudd to telephone their American counterparts to make representations about the US travel ban, Downing Street has said.

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2017/jan/29/donald-trump-us-travel-ban-refugees-airports) says Boris is going to speak with Steve Bannon (Trump's chief adviser who incidentally just replaced the head of the US military on their national security council) to make it clear that the UK is expecting an exemption for its dual citizens. Trudeau has already got an assurance that Canadians are exempt so it shouldn't take long.

**Edit (01:13, 30/01/17):**

Just for completeness, the Foreign Office is now saying that anyone with UK citizenship is exempt unless they additionally have citizenship of one of the affected countries *and* you're travelling from one of the affected countries.

The FCO is also saying that the order *only* applies to those people who are travelling from those countries, so if you're not travelling from one of the countries you're fine regardless of nationality. Though I'd take that with a pinch of salt."

"Honestly? As a kid growing up in Greater Manchester, we'd get a bit of abuse on the way to Synagogue on Saturdays. Had some grief with an Iraqi kid at school (mid 90s). At uni, no problems whatsoever and I was in the Jewish society. In my 20s, I had eggs thrown at me in Golders green, the odd snip from a co-worker and some funny remarks from neighbours.

BUT.. it's hardly been much in my life. I'm not religious and I'm not identifiably Jewish. I don't wear a magen david (star of david) or yumulka/kippot. My kids do go to a Jewish school, and they've never knowingly had any anti-semitism pointed at them.

However, I live in a leafy bit of South Hertfordshire that has a large moderate Jewish community. I'm sure it's different for the really religious guys in North London.

Anti-semitism online is far more prevalent than in real life."

"1) Previously: Authoritarian Home Secretary, supporter of invasive surveillance, guilty of contempt of court as HS.   Now:  Prime Minister 'through the back door', has taken the most extreme possible interpretation of Brexit as her mandate, suggested she would attempt to undermine parliamentary democracy by triggering Article 50 alone (thankfully a case was brought.)  Seems to think 51.9% looks a lot like 100%.  Seems to be making decisions in the interests of her party and future electability, not the nation's prosperity as a whole.  Wants absolute control of negotiations, allowing her to independently, individually, and with no on-going accountability to strip huge numbers of rights from British Citizens.  Supports corp. tax dropping further but not funding the NHS.     Actively supported measures that stopped poor British citizens bringing their non-EU spouse to the UK (based on wealth/income alone)

2)  Three line whip enforcing all members of his party to give Theresa May the power to do whatever she pleases regarding Brexit, despite being a known rebel.    Far too left wing for a reasonable election campaign.  Flip-flops on the EU a lot.  Weak leadership skills.  23 Cabinet resignations since he's taken leadership (iirc?), many more.

3)  Seen as responsible for on-going failure of the NHS, supports privatisation, NHS privatisation has increased significantly since 2010.  Fails to provide sufficient funding.  Particularly loathed.  

4) Brutal cuts against sick and disabled whilst Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.  Later resigned for saying cuts went too far.

5) Huge supporter of austerity even when poorly supported by economics.  Huge supporter (and implementer) of cuts, including to the NHS.  Seen as 'slimy' and out of touch.  Concerns of nepotism (relationship to Cameron.)  Seen as cutting taxes to rich, giving disproportionately to wealthy elderly and cutting funding to ... everything!

6) War on teachers/schools, hugely pro privatisation of education (academies) no support for schemes like EMA (which hugely benefitted me personally), oh and ""the people of this country have had enough of experts""

If it's busy, and the only available seats are in the quiet carriage, then you have simple choices available:

a) Sit in the quiet carriage, and observe the request to be quiet.

b) Get up, walk out of the quiet carriage, and have your ""Naah, the signal's crap, you're dropping out ... what? Didn't catch that"" phone conversation while standing up in a part of the train not designated as quiet.

"'My sister will probably be ok with it' sounds to me like you haven't told her, and you're just planning on turning up at her doorstep? I'd be fuming if someone had done to me at uni, especially someone underage for an entire weekend. Have you not considered that she might have plans? She might be going out with her friends, she might have bought tickets for an event, she might not even be there - she might be using her last free weekend before lectures start to go and visit a mate. If my brother had turned up at mine at uni without telling me and expected to stay with me all weekend, I'dve told him to go home.

Also is she even allowed guests in her halls? Most unis you're allowed people to stay for one night, but they have to be over 18. Subwardens tend to turn a blind eye to boyfriends and whatnot, cos they could conceivably just be another student, but it'll be very obvious that a 12/13 year old is not a student and is staying the night.

"First let's understand what your friend might be annoyed about.

&gt;At Uber we've always believed in standing up for what's right. Today we need your help supporting drivers who may be impacted by President Trump's new immigration ban. 

&gt;Drivers who are citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria or Yemen and live in the US but have left the country, will not be able to return for 90 days. This means they won't be able to earn money and support their families during this period. 

&gt;It's important that as a community we do everything we can to help these drivers. Here's what Uber will do:

&gt;  	Provide 24/7 legal support for drivers who are trying to get back into the country. Our lawyers and immigration experts will be on call 24/7 to help.

&gt; 	Compensate drivers for their lost earnings. This will help them support their families and put food on the table while they are banned from the US.

&gt; 	Urge the government to reinstate the right of US residents to travel—whatever their country of origin—immediately.

&gt; 	Create a $3 million legal defense fund to help drivers with immigration and translation services.

Oh, well I guess he should walk then.

I guess he could walk/cycle/drive, get a taxi or minicab (so many companies), or use public transport"

"OK, as I am sure you understand, the people who hate each person are different but maybe overlapping in some cases.

1) Who hates May?

The kind of /r/unitedkingdom reddit demographic who are Remain, progressive in political views and quite libertarian.

Why? they see her as authoritarian, old-fashioned, and above all, as taking the referendum vote too literally as a complete repudiation of the economic as well as political aspects of the EU.

2) Who hates Corbyn?

Hmmm. Probably centrist Labour supporters and some older people who see his old-fashioned (some historic) leftist support for Castro, Palestianian liberation organisations and the old IRA as still a problem.

Why? a) many Labour supporters think that he is an elctoral liability, whose leftism and lack of leadership qualities hand future elections to Tories on a plate. (Because we have a centrist elecorate and also polls say one that does not see him as a leader of the country)

b) His recent fuzziness on the EU issue has annoyed a lot of people who feel it contributes to not knowing what Labour think.

c) A few people will hate him for his support for old left-wing causes.

3) Jeremy Hunt

This one is simple- he is the minister responsible for the NHS and therefore he takes the flak for any fear of cuts in it, deterioration of it.

Recently there has a been a long-running dispute regarding junior doctors (ones who work in hospitals) and it is also remembered that he at one time wrote about ways to privatise the supply side of the NHS.

4) IDS - again simple- those who hate him see him as one or both of the following:

a) harsh on ill and disabled people when responsible for their benefits.

b) an example of the hard-Brexit Tory group.

5) Osborne - now less hated because he is out of the limelight. Representative of the 'Notting Hill' Tory- very rich and privileged themselves, but keen to make the lives of ordinary people more difficult in order to balance the books quicker.

6) Michael Gove.

a) often thought personally repulsive

b) regressive views on education

c) another hard Brexiteer and as others have said, responsible for the famous 'people have had enough of experts' remark.

I should say plenty of people do like and respect May and Corbyn. Actually, I am one such- I see them both as very principled, although I don't agree completely with either at all."
"The entire MO of the Daily Mail (and especially the Mail Online) entire is pretty much publish any old shit in order to get as many pageviews (and so advert revenue) as possible.
