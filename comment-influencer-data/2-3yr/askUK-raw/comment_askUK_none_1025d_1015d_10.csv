Eat a kinder egg. 
Your colleague is a bellend.
"Tailgating in the UK means to follow someone very closely whilst driving fyi.

The closest equivilant is probably the car-boot sale, which is an organised event where members of the public can book a slot in order to sell unwanted goods out of their car boot.

We also have fetes and fairs and bric-a-brac sales, but again these are usually organised.

Also, don't look up 'dogging'. That's just pure NSFW.
"
"Pooed.

Or shat."
"They are hugely respected by people in general, they are known (by all the ex-forces people I've ever spoken to) as savage warriors who are fiercely loyal to the British Army.

They have served our country for over 200 years and 50k of them have died on our behalf, they have also won 13 Victoria Crosses. 

250k people signed a petition to give them automatic residency rights and equal pensions a few years ago

So I think your mate is indeed a bellend."
"Cross the street anywhere you like.
Drink while in a motor vehicle.
Buy alcohol under the age of 21.
Drive on the left.
"
"Yes, I absolutely would and do. I love it. Popcorn/sweets, a comfy seat, and no chat with anyone for a couple hours? It's brilliant. "
People usually go to the pub before a match instead. 
"Small damp country in the North Atlantic manages to bag a larger proportion of the world's area and population than any before or since.

It's an achievement of note, whatever you may think of the consequences.

I also think it's a bit rich to blame Britain for the mess that is modern Kashmir or indeed the communal violence surrounding independence. Most people involved on the British side thought that the timescale for partition and independence was far too tight to achieve a lasting, peaceful settlement but those that wanted independence were not prepared to wait and Britain simply didn't have the resources or the will to resist them."

"Sit down and watch all the 12 episodes of Fawlty Towers.

Then just act like Basil Fawlty tries to appear, not how he does, and you're set.

The word 'sorry' is also your new best friend. Slip it onto the end of as many sentences as possible, even if you don't think it will fit. It will.

Sorry.

See."

You can exchange them for goods and services to the value of five pounds for each note.
Has sadly  passed away.
"&gt; Derren Brown is the loveliest I've met   
   
was he, or did he just convince you to say that? 

"
I usually take them out before I eat my.burger. but I don't dislike them enough to specially request they're left off when I order. 
"You have to bear in mind that most sports stadiums here are in the middle of very old cities with no space. They don't generally have big open-air car parks, so what you describe would be impossible. 

Most people don't drive to sporting events anyway, parking is a nightmare in most UK cities at the best of times, and it would be even worse if there was a big match on. Way easier to get the train, and that way you can drink too. 

We go to the pub instead. "
"Because most people aren't very good drivers and have never done a theory test or read the highway code. 

Also the majority of people are seemingly unaware of the fact that there are other people in the world. "
"You're fucking nicked son... you'll end up in the UK's equiv. of Gitmo, the Isle of Sheppey. "
Like a passport?
"Yes they are, and under rule 170 of the Highway Code, that driver should have given way."
"This thread is proving how perfectly formed the word ""shat"" is"
"There's always some bloke down the pub selling stuff off the back of a lorry.

That lorry is your mate's house, I am sorry to say."
"Aldi, that way not only can I get bread, potatoes and the like, but I can also pick up a chainsaw and a microwave at the same time."
"London as a whole doesn't have a flag.

The City is the historical heart of London and is the nucleus around which modern London has grown over the centuries, and it's legally and politically distinct from other parts of London.

Given the lack of any alternatives, it seems quite appropriate to me."
"SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSHHHHH

You can't ask something like that in here - are you trying to start a rumble!?!?"
Definitely don't look whilst at work.
"""Would you please stop talking about the war?""  
""Me?! You started it""  
""We did not start it!""  
""Yes you did, you invaded Poland""  

I think that is my favourite dialogue of any comedy I've ever watched. "
"Met Richard Hammond when he was recording a TV show in my hometown, he was a nice bloke and stopped for photos but definitely prefers to keep a low profile (no pun intended)."
"It's a combination of someone famous, a well known disease, and dieing young.

Those writing the articles are probably around the same age so it's probably a sense of ""that could be me"" flowing through."
Yes. To both.
"I really liked them whenever I had to work with them. They were all very disciplined and hard working little nutjobs. Think of a load of angry little oompa loompas running around with bad ass looking knive's on their belts :)

When we were in Sangin they used to come back from patrols with goats that they'd killed while out and about lol, which they'd then make a curry with that was fucking delicious. 

I had a bit of bants with one in the commcen and used to ask him if he wanted me to grab something off any high shelves for him, his reply ...""fuck you round eye""

Your colleagues a dick, I used to think they were cool. I don't know if its an urban legend but their selection process back in nepal sounds fucking nails as well, lugging a load of shit up a mountain or something :/"
"This will be the most downvoted thing I ever put on reddit, but...David Attenborough was really cold and brusque with me as a child.  To be fair he was doing a signing after we had seen him do a talk, so maybe he was tired, but my memory is of being amazed and a bit sad how miserable he was."
"Colleague, not mate"
BBC Radio 6.
"Bloody hell yes! I have a wife and two kids under 5 and whenever I can, I go on my own. Bliss. 

I went to a mid week screening of The Arrival last week and it was just me in the screening. Like I had my own private screening of the film"
take a look what www.wickeduncle.co.uk has - but their prices are too much so buy the same things from amazon instead. 
"Have a polite word over the fence and say ""Those koi look way to big for that pond!"" in a fun, almost jokey manner and see what they say.  
  
If they're snide about it, glass them. (Don't actually glass them)."
"Yes, under the 'Nasty Words and Namecalling act of 2014' you are liable to be sentenced for up to 30 years in an isocube.

"Former cafe and restaurant manager here.

I can confirm what everyone is saying, as long as you keep quiet, don't make a  mess and have bought something you're good. That time of day there is no-one in anyway, so you shouldn't be a bother to anyone.

More concerned about you though, have you no friends you can talk to about this that have nice mum's that might understand? Maybe you could hang out there instead of having to wait in a cafe. Or an after school club? Remember, if you ever feel fed up about things, it really does help to tell someone how you are feeling. Sometimes it can feel really hard to reach out and that you are all alone, but you're not. People care and CAN help. I'm on mobile and busy but if anyone can find any links for OP that would be great."
"Me and a mate went hiking in the Yorkshire moors once. We went into a local pub and the locals were less than friendly but they did warn us not to go out at night. Anyway, long story short I can't wear silver jewellery any more and razors are costing me an arm and a leg."
"It really isn't.

The City of London has its own police force, its own mayor, its own administrative processes, all of which are different from those in Greater London. Even its voting system is different from the rest of the country."
A passport? In an airport?
"One of my friends quite literally bumped into Attenborough on the tube a while back, but said he was lovely. Maybe you caught him on an off day."
"*Debrett's New Guide to Etiquette and Modern Manners* covers the more formal things like British table manners, social customs and so on.

You might also want to check out *Watching the English* for the less formal side of things, such as making small talk.

Probably the best single piece of advice I could give is that [America and Britain have different politeness strategies.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jbu-eMcEF3s)"

"He's making the distinction between the [City of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_London) (which has a resident population of around 7,000), and [Greater London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_London) with a resident population of around eight and a half million."
"Widely respected. The UK's hierarchy of badassery goes something like:

SAS/SBS

Marines/Paras/Ghurkas

Yer nan when she's got the arse

The rest of the armed forces



"
"Yeah when you think about it....it's a couple of hours watching a film, it's not like you're talking to the person next to you or engaging with them pretty much the whole time. 

"
It's not the law but its recommended. 
"Not really, I should see more. It's often cheaper and quicker to fly to somewhere in Mainland Europe (there may even be abundant sunshine!) so I think that tends to win these days.

Trains can be really expensive long distance if you don't book a long way in advance, coaches aren't much fun unless you are a masochist. Although the UK looks very small compared to the USA it's still quite a drive to say Scotland from London, or the South coast to Manchester.    "
"""Darling, I'm afraid that Mutley has rather compromised the carpet."""
"My city has two professional football teams, one in the top division and one in the second-top, and neither of their stadiums even has a car park. People go to nearby pubs then walk to the ground."
"Place a bet at a high street bookmaker's shop. Eat real haggis. Eat cheese made from raw milk.

I would say ""wild camping"" but that's not an option in London.

Edit: I should have said ""camp somewhere without the owner's permission"" rather than just ""wild camping"" and ""eat cheeses that contain high levels of non-toxigenic e. coli such as Roquefort"" rather than just ""eat raw milk cheeses""."
"*checks in undies*

Nope. Still not a lad. Phew."
"Helena Bonham Carter, Stephen Fry, David Mitchell, Maisie Williams, John Cleese.

Mostly lovely, but John Cleese really wasn't very nice, rude and grumpy. Not 'comedically' rude and grumpy, just a rude old man."
"Saw Bill Bailey after one of his shows.
He was the nicest, most surreal bloke.
10/10 would meet again."
Oooh this is cryptic...Dundee?
Sorry.
