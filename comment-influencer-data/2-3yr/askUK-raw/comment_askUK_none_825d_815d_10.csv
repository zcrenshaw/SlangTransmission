You can tell estate agents are lying when their lips move and sounds come out of their mouths.
"You have every right to use the disabled toilets! A few of the supermarkets in my area have introduced bathroom signs reminding people that not every disability (or reason for using a disabled toilet) is visible - I wish more places would do it and then people might start to understand. You're doing nothing wrong, try to ignore people's reactions"
"Theres a documentary series called ""The Inbetweeners"" which does a good episode on this situation"
"I have friends who ride who wear these. I can only say they do it not out of some desire to be dicks, but out of a genuine fear for their lives from motorists who will only slow down for the police, and not out of common courtesy to other road users."
The primark in stoke on trent is a must see. 
"You will learn to budget and to be frugal. Prioritise your spending, and make sure you pay essential bills before splashing out on an expensive night out.

Do not look at the 'rich kids' and try to copy them - some (most) of them won't be rich but it'll be the first time they've had 'free money' and they'll spend it in the first few months, will then spend the rest of the year eating noodles.

Get a part time job in a bar, pub, restaurant, or shop whilst at uni which will help supplement your income. Do the same when you're at home during the holidays."
Ploughman's *salad*!?
"I didn't even know school reunions were a thing here. It seems rather...American. 

"
"If you are standing on public land then you can photograph anything.

Note that not all shopping areas are public land (but might look like it).

No one, not even police, can tell you to delete something. People can ask, but you don't have to.

Use your own judgement if it worth arguing the toss with someone who is talking shit, or just moving on.

"For the little extra commission they will get, the estate agent would probably prefer the house sold now rather than faff around for a few more weeks trying to find a buyer. 

I suspect its the vendor having unrealistic expectations of the price."
"You're not sure you're suited to academic life but you want to go back to uni and study something else?

Archaeology doesn't make you unemployable. I have an Ancient History and Archaeology degree, with a ""low"" 2:1 (which you'll never declare. You've got a 2:1) and I work on the railway in a great position. All you need to do is find the transferable, non-technical skills, that apply in many job areas. "

You can order it yourself but you need a meal and to be sitting with an adult to actually have it. So order a cheeky roast dinner and get gloomy dave to sit with you
"The missus loves to do that, my kettle doesn't light up when it's boiling and many a time I've set it to boil, went for a shower or something and the fucker's still been cold when I come back.

I feel your pain."
"You are 100% fine. Sorry you are receiving comments or odd looks; although it may be that you're feeling self conscious and perceiving things as odd looks due to your social anxiety (I know the feeling). Just remind yourself that IBS is 100% a legitimate and unpleasant problem that entitles you to use that toilet. You have a RADAR key, and there are many many many problems that require a disabled toilet but you can look perfectly healthy. For all anyone knows you have a colostomy bag strapped to you after bowel cancer - you'd still look perfectly normal so anyone judging people for using the disabled toilets just because they don't look physically disabled is an idiot.

"
"I don't think it will be a problem - you can stay in the UK for 6 months on a tourist visa, and that includes to and from europe.

Since you are only entering and leaving the Schengen area once, that also seems fine to me. 
"
"Say... thanks for the invite, you've prior plans out of the country, sadly cannot attend, hope its a good event...

no need to go, no need to drop the truth on um"
"In the first year of uni I lived in halls with a girl/woman who was from just outside Cambridge, and who wasn't able to point to England on a world map.  We teased her quite a lot, but then found out she couldn't even point to her own home town on a map of the UK.  Like, when the old school weather came on and the weather person stuck little clouds on the map of the UK she still had no idea whether or not it was going to rain because she didn't know where she lived.  BAFFLING.
"
"I've managed to reach my mid-40s, with several academic qualifications, without realising ""polite"" was a synonym for ""passive aggressive cuntyness""...

I normally slow down for horses anyway but, if anything, this would have the opposite effect on me."
"You've got to keep it on the lead, or it might run away."
Marks and Spencer does 7 decent-quality pairs for Â£12.
It's that button you press to continue watching your movie.
"I neither read newspapers nor visit coffee shops, but I work at one so I'll share what the proper code of conduct is. First remove the sports section. If your newspaper doesn't have one, borrow one from a different newspaper.  Then fold the newspaper in such a way the front page is burried about 1/3rd of the way through the paper. You don't want it too close to the middle or you run the risk of it being easy to reassemble. Finally, spill your coffee on it and pour some sugar on the floor while you're at it. "
I worked with someone who'd been to Eton. He was a condescending little prick who fulfilled almost every negative stereotype about posh people that exists
"He was talking out of his arse. If you're stood on public land then with the exception of certain government or Crown buildings you can film or photograph anything you want (for personal use). A high street would usually fall squarely in the ""public"" category.

Besides, security guards are members of the public so don't even have any legal power to check what's on your camera. If they try to gain access to your camera or threaten legal action then tell them you feel under threat of physical violence and if they carry on it could be considered assault."
no
"As long as the train you are on stops at Oakham and Coleshill Parkway then there is no problem. If you are on a train which does not stop at these stations then your ticket on said service is invalid.

I would be surprised if the guard had not come across a split ticket before."
"Because they don't agree on what to do.
If one party wants to raise taxes, and one to lower them, what's the compromise point? Do nothing?
"
"You can't. I refuse to purchase 3-door cars for partly this reason. 

I also feel really claustrophobic in the back of them and have a (probably largely irrational) fear of being trapped in an accident."
"M&amp;S is nearly always the answer to ""where can I buy &lt;standard item of clothing&gt; at good quality for a reasonable price"".

Marks &amp; Spencer might not be fashionable or have a glamorous image, but you don't keep the middle classes of Britain in underwear and shirts for over a century without having some idea of getting it right."
"I went to my 10 Year Anniversary with a lot of apprehension,  The plan was to go show my face stay for an hour and drive home. 

I rang the wife after the first hour to say I'm leaving the car and having a drink. I ended up staying out all night and walking past an angry wife as she was going to work the next morning.

It gave me a lot of closure, I'd gone in imagining everyone was going to be the same as they were back then. They weren't.  "
What's more worrying is the fact that this girl got accepted into University. 
"I worked with a guy from Kenya in a bar in the UK for three years. We didn't often work together, but one day I noticed him serve some kids a couple of beers.

I quietly asked him if he'd checked their ID and it turned out he thought the legal drinking age was 14 and had the entire time he'd work there. "
I see countless people who think we directly elect the Prime Minister.
You've made by evening. Can't help on them though. Are they all Geordie Shores?
"I had enough trouble persuading the wife to let me keep the router and sky box plugged in and turned on overnight, back when broadband and DVR were new and exciting :-)"
"Not really convinced that horse riders should be allowed on main roads really, too dangerous for both drivers, riders and the horse no matter how experienced the rider is. That being said I don't drive like a dickhead speeding past them because of some jerk effort to show them who's boss, people who do that are worse than horses.

As for the jacket, I can't begrudge them for doing it, but sort of think that if you have to fake being a poilce officer to have a chance of riding about safely maybe consider what you are doing isn't safe? Sure it's your given right to ride a horse on roads with cars, but is the risk worth it?! I wouldn't even cycle along some of the B roads round here, let alone go on a horse. People can be such bad drivers it's not worth it imo.

"
"My SO insists on switching *everything* off at the wall when we go on Holiday.

The other 48 weeks a year, everything can be on 24/7.

Because wall sockets only attack when the owners are on holiday."

get one of those. use it. "
"The Guardian, for example, has US and Aus sections with their own staff, as the common language means they can get more clicks. This might explain some of the articles. If you go the The Guardian site at certain times, there'll be Aus stories trending in the most-read list due to the time differences. "
"'Disabled' toilets are really *accessible* toilets for anyone who has a need that's not met by standard toilets. If an accessible toilet is easier for you than a standard, use it. Ignore the looks OP, and if anyone makes a comment then remind them that not all disabilities are visible.

If I may veer off-topic briefly: many accessible toilets have a red emergency cord. If you see one that's been tied up to 'keep it tidy', untie and let it hang loose. They're designed to be within reach of someone who's fallen and needs help, they're less useful 4 feet off the floor.

There are also many people out there with disabilities whose needs *aren't* met by standard accessible toilets. [Changing Places](http://changing-places.org) is trying to improve that. If you work somewhere with a facility with one of their signs, take a couple of minutes and familiarise yourself with what it means, it'll come in handy at some point. "
"It's actually frightening how many drivers are disrespectful to horse riders - I have known people openly admit that they beep their horn at horses etc. I don't think these people understand how some horses can react to that - the rider could be thrown off and killed in traffic, or the horse could kick and damage your car, etc. It's so so sad. 

I also know riders who have had dogs purposefully set on them, who have had rocks thrown at them, etc.

So I don't blame people for trying to get some extra security."
Most people won't stay until midnight. All of the important stuff will probably be done by 8pm and the rest of the evening will be drinking / partying. It's socially acceptable to leave at any point once the loud party music starts.
"AIUI the accompanying adult must buy the alcohol.  It is never legal for under 18s to purchase.

Also note that whilst the law permits it, it's down to individual premises whether or not to serve you.  I've no idea how widely it is done in practise."
An undertakers?
She's now a primary school teacher O.o
"You think that's bad - once had a traffic warden ticket me because I was stopped on a double yellow line along with 3 other cars - because we'd pulled over for 10 seconds to let an ambulance through. 

You have to wonder what planet they live on. "
I would want it shut.
"Bricks.  Usually little bricks on the outside, with big bricks (breeze blocks, or is it cinder blocks you call them?) on the inside.

We do find your wooden houses slightly amusing.  They're also pretty terribly energy inefficient I believe, without major insulation.  That's not so renewable.

Also, remember the size of the UK.  Transporting materials isn't such an issue here.  Other than some places like the highlands of Scotland, we don't really do vast wilderness."
"They employ people to stand in the door and ask me what i need today, instead of having a fucking cashier to actually take the money i need to pay in. "
