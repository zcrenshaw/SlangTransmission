"Even the phrase ""mixed relationship"" doesn't sit right with me.

It's just such an unnecessary adjective."
but pushups wont take me to the shops.
I find that I can usually make a sandwich without resorting to a recipe.
Probably because we have no history of racial segregation - there are tales from WW2 of British citizens standing up for Black GIs right to socialise with everyone else - see **The Battle of Bamber Bridge**
"We have much less of a white supremacy vibe going on here.

Plus, it helps that we're next to mainland Europe, so we're already exposed to people of many different cultures."
"&gt; I'm quite surprised and appalled.

I'm a bloke.  If I went into Victoria's Secret and asked to try on the panties they'd quite rightly tell me to fuck off."
"Before xmas dinner, my dad is insistent on all of us holding hands around the xmas tree and dancing around it singing ""the grand old duke of york"". If we get any line or word wrong, we have to start it from the very beginning. Last year it took nearly 45 minutes to complete it. He gets very angry and upset if we don't do it."
"&gt;I read somewhere she was Ill 

She had a sherry induced hangover. Liz will outlive us all. "
A little weird? You could just do some push ups.
"I've alot of experience in this. 10 Christmas' as a divorcee who  gets the kids on boxing day means Ive got creative about filling Christmas day up. 

Firstly do not sit at home getting pissed watching shit TV. You gotta plan ahead and get out of the house. 

So, first few years i just packed a back pack with some turkey sandwiches and a couple of wee bottles of wine and went on a huge 5 hour walk with the dog- who got sandwiches too. I've gone hill walking and beach combing on other years. But, I soon realised it was more fun to set myself a task. So a couple years ago I walked in a perfectly straight line accross the countryside to see how far I could go from my house (I live on the edge of a wee village). Turns out the answer is 5 miles and a hell of alot of cuts and bruises from hedge jumping. Another year I cycled around my nearest town taking artistic photos with my phone of things in alphabetical order from A to Z (Aldi to Zebra crossing it turns out). Then, last year i discovered a back way to sneak into my local zoo (dont do this at home kids) and take photos of the animals while dodging a couple of keepers.

Thing is -get creative and do something that will help you forget the loneliness and at the same time help you remember the day with a smile."
It doesn't mean we didn't have racism.. just not state-assisted racism!
"Hate to break it to you mate, but the CEO of Eurostar is a fucking huge springer spaniel."
If it was me a bottle of something nice and a card would mean more than money. If I'm already driving that way and you're always ready to go when I am and no detours then I'm not fussed about economical impact. A little present says thank you but money complicates it. 
"Are you **actually** being kicked out, or have you just decided you must leave in the morning?

Edited to add: I didn't mean to sound unsympathetic, but time scale really does make a difference. If you can stick it out for a few more weeks, you have more options. If you're being chucked out tomorrow, you need emergency options - which are never going to be good."
"I make food at home, saves a ton of money. "
"As they would a woman, you cannot try on panties before you buy because of basic hygiene.  

Have a go to prove the point - try a dress on. I think they would be embarrassingly helpful in fact, where do you think drag performers or cross dressers get their clothes? "
About 3 hours down the M4
It's always people who wouldn't have to do it who want it
"You absolutely could, you're going to have to swallow you're pride and tell them that you need help.
""Mate I need to crash at your flat for a few days while I sort some shit out""
Then for the next few days do nothing but apply to jobs speak to friends of friends chap every local businesses door and ask them if they have work. "
"Firstly, I've literally never heard of this in any shop. Then again, there aren't that many shops I am in that are purely women-only (I'm a guy), but even so I am surprised to hear this is Topman policy.

&gt;Women who identify themselves as gender neutral or as men, and this is judged by their clothing and 'lack of the use of make-ups'

Was this a real quote or paraphrasing? That sounds like an awful policy."
Hospital car parks. 
Give him a Fredo if u can afford one at today's rates.
"I've found the shittier the job, the more unreasonable detail they want."
"I mean, people are going to assume you're disabled and are going to treat you like a disabled person and might get quite annoyed if they give you concessions then find out you're able-bodied but just pissing about in a wheelchair. 

I know you're not actively trying to defraud people by pretending you're disabled, but that's how people will see it. "
Nearest town I think they will have heard of. 
"I really am struggling to find one single fuck. 

"
"This something I have also always noted. American tv always has a black couple and if there is a mixed couple then part of the storyline will be about the racism they face for being a mixed couple. 

It seems to me that despite have a far larger black population it isn't that common for white and black people to hang around together in the US besides the odd 'token' friend. I'm guessing due to the whole civil rights issues in the US  (which didn't really happen to the same extent here) there are still huge divides and mistrust from both sides. 

I mean even going back to WW2 the US had black only regiments whilst black troops from the colonies were treated just like any other soldier in the UK. There are stories of American GIs kicking off whilst in the uk because we let black people in our cinemas and cafes "
"That's it - if you've never really had segregation then you've not had years of anger and resentment building up on both sides, which invariably cause issues. "
Thrifty.... but a bit grim.
"We get absolutely hammered ASAP and then watch a really bleak non-christmas film in the afternoon. We take it in turns to choose the film. Recent years have seen Deliverance, Requiem for a Dream and Under the Skin. It's my turn this year, I'm hoping to traumatise my entire family with Threads.

Edit: My mum made us turn it off because she got too upset. I'm worried I've gone too far this time. We all had a good old giggle at [this woman's ](http://m.imdb.com/name/nm1856457/) IMDB page though. "
"I have seen on here a lot of people moaning about the fact that there was a programme on TV in the UK in the 60s or 70s called ""Love Thy Neighbour"" in which most of the joke was that a white working class family lived next door to a black family. What is not mentioned is that the joke was that the women got on fine and the white racist man was always on the losing side of any argument or problem because he was thick and racist. The lesson to be learnt from it was that only idiots were racist, - we were always on the side of the black family."
"&gt;It's none of their damned business 

It literally *is* their business."
"I am British, my wife is Polish.  Our relationship has only ever been called a ""mixed marriage"" in Poland, never in the UK.

We're both White, and we could easily both be Polish, or both be English based upon our physical appearance."
Are you trying to incite a riot?
Most UK town centres on a Saturday night are a pretty good bet. 
"&gt; they could have offered you a staff room

Yeah, no. That's where the staff keep their personal belongings and where they go to get away from customers. I worked retail for years and staff areas are strictly off limits to the public and with good reason.

Not saying the Topman policy is correct, btw. Gender-neutral changing rooms (and toilets for that matter) should be the norm, imo."
"If I was to pick three, in no particular order:

* [Lynn, I've pierced my foot on a spike!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj63LflLIwk) from _I'm Alan Partridge_
* [Jen bumps into Roy and Moss after the gay musical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49MnzqB28qQ) from _The IT Crowd_
* [Mark leaves a message on Sophie's answerphone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxO_wp0AQqY) from _Peep Show_"
"And both of them are in the same metal basket in the middle of the shop, next to the wetsuits."
"Perhaps we have safer road systems, rather than safer drivers. 

Some countries certainly are a nightmare to drive in *stares at Italy*."
I actually like your logic OP
"Yeah, that sounds illegal."
"Can they actually find someone though?  Is December a popular time to start courses?

"
"London... Polish.... Ealing? If commute is doable - let's get shitfaced and exchange gifts :) I'm in the same situation as you are, so why da hell not
"
"Tesco.  I used to buy a Sainsburys one virtually every day. Even if Tesco uses the same supplier, they're range isn't tiny like Sainsburys. "
"Well, yes.

A contract was signed.

Why should the university lose out on that income just because your sister decided to pack in her course?

"
"No, it's a reaction to you being a pedantic arse. I'm willing to bet a significant majority of this sub voted Remain."
That's not how anxiety works. Just the thought of putting yourself in a position where strangers may approach you can be enough to induce an attack in some people.
"Legally speaking, Charles will become king at the exact moment of the Queen's death. There is a very specific and rehearsed protocol for what the groups who need to do something will have to do.

[This](http://royalcentral.co.uk/other/what-will-happen-when-the-queen-dies-70953) website has a lot of detail"
"Those aren't in the UK, so yes."
"Mate, just wash your clothes or put some clean ones on if you're a weed smoker.

Failing that, if you can't stay off the drugs long enough to get a train then you've probably got bigger problems in your life to worry about than sniffer dogs."
"*Which one of you bitches wants to dance? Hey, you know when you're doing your usual threesome thing you do on a weekend, and the moonlight's bouncing off your heads and your arses and everything, does that not get a bit confusing? Right. This is you, okay? Tra-la-la!  Millwall! That's the one! Do you know this chant? ""Millwall, Millwall, you're all really dreadful, and your girlfriends are unfulfilled and alienated...""*"
"It's a direct quote. I asked the person to clarify how one would define another as gender-neutral in their store, and that was the answer she gave me, based on these physical appearance. "
We build a giant wicker man in the back garden then phone 101 and report that someone has nicked the lawnmower out of the shed.
"As others have said, the succession happens at the moment the monarch dies. Someone will go to Charles (if he is not at the Queen's bedside) and tell him he is King (the Queen was on a foreign tour when her father died, so she had to be informed).

There is sure to be at least one public holiday day for mourning.

Do I care? Yeah. She's all I've known, and that's a long time for me - I'm in my mid 50s- so I shall be sad in a sentimental way.

Am I a Royalist? Kind of, but I think it's mainly to do with the Queen and thinking she's done a good job; I am not so keen on any other Royal. I did like Princess Diana, but as we all know, she had a troubled relationship with the other royals.I also do like Prince Philip because he clowns around and says unacceptable things that he can get away with, no doubt to make the Queen's life less boring."
