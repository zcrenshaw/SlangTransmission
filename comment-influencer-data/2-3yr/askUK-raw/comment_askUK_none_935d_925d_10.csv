"Everyone had loads of money then they didn't. The Olympics happened: Mo Farah ran fast, Dizzee Rascal had his moment. Blur got back together and did blinding sets at Glastonbury and in Essex, an average Hyde Park gig, and a great one in Hong Kong -where they began recording a new album. The Libertines were the Future Of Rock And Roll for a while. Pubs banned smoking. Tony Blair was instrumental in a package of lies that led to about half a million deaths. C&amp;A, Woolworths and a few other shops went bust. David Cameron is a cunt. Ronnie Pickering is a man to be respected. Purple Aki actually exists. Young men have beards and pay a fiver for coffee. Howard Marks died. John Peel died. John Martyn, Davy Graham, John Renbourn and Bert Jansch died. Grange Hill and Brookside ended.

"The only reason the school doesn't want you to make a police complaint is because it reflects poorly on them and their inability to maintain discipline and deal with issues, although the school itself probably doesn't have the means to do this anyway. They do not have your best interests at heart here. One of my cherished childhood memories was the absolute state my PR-obsessed school headmistress was in when a mass racially-motivated brawl in the playground had to be broken up by about 9 coppers, which obviously made it into the local papers and made the school a laughing stock in town for a few weeks. 

There's probably not so much the police can do but it might scare the bully into leaving your child alone if she/he is dealt with by them, anybody of secondary school age is considered wholly responsible for their actions in law. "

"Greetings from /r/ukvisa

If she is in the UK on a Tier 5 Youth Mobility Scheme visa (which I'm assuming because it's so common for Canadian citizens), her employer actually doesn't sponsor her visa. Canadians aren't required to have an employment sponsor for this visa type, so she can leave employment without immigration consequence. The visa is granted for 24 months and gives the holder free rein to find employment or study at their leisure. The Canadian government is technically her visa sponsor.

"Actually the desserts on GBBO are rather toned down compared to what we usually eat at home, the reason being that it is considered extremely rude to appear boastful of ones talents. This evening, after dinner my mum rolled out a three-tier cheesecake topped with grated truffle, flakes of gold leaf, and a miniature iced figure of everyone who was sat around the table. That's pretty bog-standard for us, but if she went on the telly she'd probably just do a victoria sponge or summat so as not to look like a show-off. "

"Good news! There are lots of Swedes here (hej förresten). There's a really active Facebook community for Swedish ex-pats if that's your cup of tea. (Do you enjoy tea? You better get used to tea. It's not like coffee is illegal or anything but it's not commonly on offer unless it's instant. I'm thinking workplaces and people's houses, not cafés here. Anyway, back on topic!)

I moved to the UK ten years ago and I've lived in various places: Bournemouth, Cardiff, Manchester, Dundee, Cambridge, and now Rotherham. I've spent huge amounts of time in lots of other places as well (having friends all over the place really helps you get a feeling for the regional differences here). 

Big differences: 

1) Brits aren't very health conscious compared to Swedes. I'm not meaning everyone is obese but there's not the same attitude towards healthy living and taking good care of yourself that there is back home.

2) When looking for a place to live NOBODY will tell you how large a room, flat or house is (in terms if square metres or any other measurement). That's not how it's done here. They'll tell you about how many bedrooms (i.e. rooms that aren't a kitchen, bathroom or lounge) a place has, but not how large it is. Living spaces here are TINY compared to Sweden, regardless of location in the country (although some places are worse than others). Prices vary wildly. For example: in Cambridge we got a crappy flat at 50m² (we measured it, adding in alcoves and other bökiga utrymmen) for £950 per month, but in Rotherham we get a 90m² house for £500 per month. See the difference? Levels of insulation also vary a lot, so prepare to buy blankets.

3) Walls. It really freaked me out when I moved here but Brits love their walls. Brick walls or solid wooden fences (tall ones too!) to give you maximum privacy in a cramped neighbourhood. Don't expect to see your neighbour's nice garden like you do in Midsomer Murders! 

4) You can get groceries delivered straight to your door by the supermarkets in a van. I love this because we don't own a car, so lugging home groceries is tiresome. As far as I'm aware Sweden hasn't caught on with that trick yet. Britain is pretty multicultural and it's catching up with food culture in general so most things can be conveniently found in most larger supermarkets. If you want special Swedish things you can order these from specialists like Scandinavian Kitchen (think Kalles and sill). IKEA also sells Swedish delicacies so you'll be alright if you live near one!

5) Brits love cash as someone already mentioned. It varies where you live: where we lived before we rarely needed to carry cash but in our new area we often pay by cash (and always carry change for buses). Also 'Swish' (which to me is a newfangled mode of transferring money) doesn't exist here. Internet banking just about does. Contactless is taking off though!

6) Perk: you can buy alcohol anywhere. Any old shop stocks alcohol (well nearly). 

7) There is no fikakultur here so brace yourself. Some workplaces don't even have breaks for tea/coffee let alone anything as elaborate as fika. Just an observation!

8) If people like you they will take the piss out of you. Mercilessly. That's how Brits show affection! If people are overly polite to you... you should worry. That's when they hate you.

I'm sure I can think of more but throw some questions at me if you'd like! :D"
"Our newspapers come with fairly overt biases, unlike our TV channels. BBC is probably your best bet for UK news that is (mostly) unbiased.

Also, a lot of newspapers have got quite clickbaity in their reporting online nowadays. The Times, Telegraph and Guardian are probably the best, but none are perfect online."

"Go to the parents. Go to the police.

The school will protect their own ends to the nth degree - show some courage and show your child how to fight for their rights. 

If the Police and parents aren't interested you may be able to bring a civil case in small claims for the costs. If nothing else, you can make life hard work for them. "

"Llangefni on Anglesey, North Wales.

Hear me out on this one as well. Yes north Wales is lovely, and I like Anglesey for the most part (though living there and visiting there are two very different things...).

But Llangefni is properly, truly shit.

Holyhead is also shit but you kind of come to expect it from a port town, they are frequently shit.

I had the misfortune of living in Llangefni. A population of just over 5000, easily the most depressing and rundown place I've ever lived. And I'm originally from some of the worst parts of North Manchester.

Firstly, I have never seen drug abuse clearly visible at all times like I've seen in Llangefni. Needles on the floor are so common it isn't even a talking point. When walking about back alleys and such you don't say to your mates ""watch out for needles"" because you are always looking about for them at all times.

The crime was rediculous. We had to put metal bars on our windows. The corner shop next door to my house was robbed at gunpoint (sawn off shotgun) 3 times in the 2 years I lived there. The owner had to put up thick metal boarding over all the windows, there was no natural light inside at all, because it was broken into and vandalised so often. The owner gave up with it all after being attacked by some cunts shouting 'English scum"" and having ""Wales not Britan"" graffitied all over the outside of the shop (spelling is a direct quote).

Every week you'd see or hear of a police raid. My next door neighbour got raided for stolen goods I believe. The same week his girlfriend came banging on our front door in tears because he was beating her.

I saw at least 5 burnt out vehicle in the fields of a special need school just down the road from my house. The same school was vandalized, stolen from and set on fire in the time I was there.

I was physically attacked for wearing and England shirt during one of the Euro's, some might say ""well what did you expect in a very Welsh part of wales"", and an offhand comment or a bit of banter and I'd agree. But physically attacking, spitting at and pretending to drive a car at a 12 year old kid? It takes a special sort of cunt to do that (this was on a trip to the shop nextdoor. My parents didn't let me wander the streets at that age don't worry).

Cars in the local Asda would frequently be scratched up by kids. So often that my mate who ended up working there after I moved away actually purchased a crap little run around that he wouldn't have to worry about.

And the place fucking stinks on a warm day. Not only is it surrounded by farm land which smells bad enough in the sun after poo spreading, but it had an abattoir, chicken processing place and a sewerage works. I would go out of my way to avoid going out on calm warm days because it smelt so bad.


You might be thinking ""yeah alright that's bad but go to many rougher parts of cities or towns and you'll get this"" and I agree. But this isn't a city or big town, it's Llangefni. 

Llangefni has a population of just over 5000. I've seen people on UK subreddit say time and time again that they are from a ""small village with only 5000 people"". Llangefni is small, but it's the second most populous settlement on the whole island.

How so much shit can be compacted into a place with 5000 people is beyond me.

Easily the worst place I've ever been. And I've been to Luton AND Bradford..."

"If you've lived in London for a year then you will be in a better position than most on here to answer your own question when comparing aus and U.K.

I guess be prepared for much smaller accommodation, more temperate climate, better internet, some household goods are cheaper, lower salary, cheap flights to Europe, more congested roads, more choice for cars, horrible coffee, crowded trains, short distances (but not necessarily quicker to travel due to congestion), worse hospitals, less racism, less macho-lad-sport crazy culture, much better TV, dirtier cities, boring/lack of wildlife, better access to cultural stuff such as art/classical music/theatres.

Just a random selection of differences that struck me from my short time in Aus. Being Reddit I know people will disagree but this is my own personal experience and I accept it is different for other people.

Also I disagree with the other respondent that London is the ""worst"". London is a dream city to live in if you have the cash. Especially the nice suburbs such as Surrey where you get the best of relaxed country life and a world city. If you earn less than 60K though then you will be more comfortable away from London."
"First of all, have you spoken to your home insurance company? If not, you should do that straight away, find out if you're covered, and decide if you want to go through them. If you do, then all further communication must be through your insurance company, and once you've passed the details of your insurance company on to them, you should not contact them or reply to them any more.

If this isn't an option, I would offer to make payments of £50/month, only after you've had confirmation from BMW that all of the charges are directly related to your incident. Make sure you keep a record of this communication with them, as well as all other communication.

If they are not happy with that, then it's up to them to them to take legal action to claim the money from you. If you've already made a reasonable offer then they are unlikely to be successful in this.

DO NOT let them bully you. They are already showing signs that they are going to bully you. Their profession should NOT be relevant, and they only reason they've mentioned it is because they hope to intimidate you into paying them. DO NOT FALL FOR THIS."
"Tell them to fuck off, and carry on your way, same as anyone else who insults you for no reason in public.

Obviously this advice will vary by area, in rural Suffolk you are all good, but I wouldn't advise this in certain other areas where it's probably best to stick to ignoring them!"
The Economist is quite good as well. It is fairly open about its editorial bias but the reporting is incredibly detailed.

"It is very easy to cut down your calorie intake while still visiting McDonalds. There are over 200 items on the McDonalds standard menu under 500 calories and only 11 items over that, 4 of which are milkshakes. 

So a Big Mac Meal:

* Big Mac - 495 calories
* Medium Chips - 340 calories
* Medium Coke - 170 calories
* **TOTAL** 1005 Calories

But you can nearly half that by swapping the Coke for a Diet coke and swapping chips for the side salad at no extra cost:

* Same Big Mac - 495
* Diet Cola - 10 calories
* Side Salad - 15 Calories
* Optional Balsamic Dressing - 20
* **TOTAL** - 540 calories

You still get your reward (the Big Mac) but feel less guilty for it because salad beats chips. It is not such a sudden change of habit but it is a new way of thinking about food and recognising what is ""good"" and ""bad"" and what is perfectly fine *in moderation*. 

It pretty much means you can have any sandwich on the menu with a diet drink and salad for 500 calories or less. If you want more than 500 calories you can easily stick the chips back in, or add a different side, or change the drink, or add a dessert, or a bigger sandwich. you can have a meal in McDonalds from 250 calories to 2500 calories just by changing which 4 items you buy. 


**things to avoid** 

* MILKSHAKES - McDonalds do 4 flavours and they are all 500 calories or more for a large and 390+ for a medium. Frappe are just as bad. 
* Milky Drinks - Sugar loaded hot chocolate is expected, but a medium Latte is almost as calorific and a mocha is almost double! Switch from latte to White coffee for a 112 calorie drop.  
* Cheese filled sides - from time to time McD do mozzarella sticks, chilli nacho balls etc. These are not much worse than chips but deep fried cheese is never going to be a healthy option. 
* promoted items - Big Tasty, Taste of xxx, limited time xxx, McChicken Overlord etc etc. They are always large, they are always full of high calorie sugar filled burger sauce, filled with cheese and most of the time they have bacon. These usually sit around 600 to 900 calories just for the sandwich (Still can add salad and diet drink for less calories than a Big Mac Meal!). Eat sparingly!  
* chips - A large chips is 470 calories. That is more than a McChicken Premier, Double cheeseburger, McChicken Sandwich, nuggets, filet-o-fish or bacon cheeseburger.  Even the medium chips is more than a cheeseburger! Chips are used by every fast food outlet and restaurant to make sure no patron leaves still feeling hungry. Naturally this makes it very easy to over eat and the generous salt content makes a large drink all the more likely. 
* dessert - pretty much everything here is a baaaaad idea. If you want something extra you can get a small pack of fruit for cheap.
* breakfast - pancakes with syrup are over 700 calories. A latte and hash brown are almost unavoidable companions to an already unhealthy McMuffin. Bacon rolls, toasties and oats are better options especially if paired with an orange juice or black/white coffee.

A lot of people will say ""go to subway"" or ""get a Tesco/Boots meal deal"" but they all hit the same trap of high calorie drinks and sides. A 6-inch sub, sandwich or pasta pot will be less than a Big Mac, but once you add Coke, packet of crisps or the cookie for the meal deal you are right back to around 1000 calories. 

If you can stick to diet or milkless drinks and dodge the cookie/cake/crisp trap you can eat pretty much anything from anywhere you want *in moderation*.

Over the past 4 years I've tried switching to Subway, Costa, Starbucks, Spud-u-like, Burger King, Pasty Co, Tesco/Sainsburys/Boots/Superdrug/M&amp;S Meal deals etc etc and McDonalds has always been the most available, most customisable and no more unhealthy than the alternatives.

"In terms of newspapers you've got:

* The Guardian - centre-left bias, but it's much less pronounced if you stick to the actual reporting and away from the opinion pieces. The Guardian's particularly well-adapted to the internet.

* The Times - minor centre-right bias, and it's probably the best of the main broadsheets you can find. As you've already pointed out however, they have a paywall online.

* The Telegraph - right-wing bias, but like the Guardian it's not so bad if you stay away from the opinion pieces. Some have said it's deteriorated a little recently, though on the whole it's still good IMO and it can be accessed online (but they have a limit on how many times you can access articles in a month).

* The Financial Times - as far as I'm aware it has a minor centre/centre-right bias, but the quality of journalism is excellent. Their website is a bit weird, because you can access an article by clicking on a link from google but you can't access that article once you're already on the website, if that makes sense. 

* The i - This one's not actually broadsheet like the others, as i's designed to be concise and politically neutral (probably the most neutral newspaper we have). It's good for reading the important news. You won't find many opinion pieces or the more obscure news stories there. I don't use their website often, but as far as I'm aware it's free.

Just so you're aware, you should make sure you avoid the tabloids (Daily Mail, Daily Express, Sun, Daily Mirror). They're all very sensationalist and take bias to a whole new level, particularly the Express which is very prone to just making stuff up. The Independent probably deserves a mention here too. It used to be another broadsheet, but since it went online-only it's become another tabloid.

Edit: Don't forget the BBC. It's not a newspaper but a TV, radio and online outlet. Most would agree it's the most neutral (it's legally bound to be neutral) and also agree that it's one of the most reliable outlets."

It's probably not the worst but it's definitely in the bottom of the pile. I don't know why I am still here.

"Are you sure you weren't looking at the timetable for a weekday, or for a Sunday? It's extremely unlikely that trains were departing earlier than normal.

Remember the rail network isn't like a motorway -- a train can't pull over to let a faster one through. The country's train timetable is worked out extremely carefully to ensure that express trains don't get stuck behind stopping services using the same line, and if trains leave stations whenever they feel like it then basically the whole network would grind to a halt."
