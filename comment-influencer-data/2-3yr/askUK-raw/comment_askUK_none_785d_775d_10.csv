"Yes they should ask. 

"
You're 26 and happily living with your parents.  I'd have thought the answer waa obvious...
I'll order you a takeaway if you're stuck (and you don't mind sending your home address to a complete stranger on the Internet).
"The first time yes but not every time. I tend to ask ""Where is the loo?"" Rather than "" Can I use your loo?"" As I feel it sounds less like asking the teacher for permission."
"I'd make a complaint to the council each time it happens. If you know what university they are attended I would make a complaint there too. I was on a couple of disciplinary panels as a student rep, and I've seen pupils be expelled from their course for refusing to follow requests to be quiet. They are adults at the end of the day, and their actions have consequences, they need to learn this."
"He can't legally be physical, and verbal abuse is unprofessional, so I'd seek alternative employment rather than stay here. 

Unfortunately, ""I'm tired from working two jobs "" is unlikely to go down well with any employer. They hire you to do a job, and will expect you to turn up fit to work. "
"Tip wherever you feel comfortable tipping. Even within the UK many people will tip and many people will not in various different situations. My husband (who is American but has lived here 10 years) will tip in all of those situations and often tips 20% which I think is excessive. I personally would only tip properly on a meal (around 10%, maybe 15% for exceptional service), and perhaps a small amount in a taxi (usually just a keep the change jobbie then) or a food delivery. I might tip bar staff in my regular pub at the end of the night; not per drink. If a coffee shop has a ""tip box"" then I might chuck my small change in mostly because carrying around loose change is a hassle. 

If you do tip then it will be greatly appreciated, but so will a smile and a polite ""Thank you very much."" You will not shock anyone if you do not tip and it is not usually expected.

In higher end restaurants check the small print at the bottom of the menu. Some include the tip as a 10% service charge."

"https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information-and-support/holidays-and-travel

I'm a few years younger, underwent DBS Last year.  

I limited walking to my mail box, about 200' from my front door. That was about it. Started working out with a Rock Steady Boxing program, and with a faithful Golden Retriever.

One of the biggest issues I had was falling down. Silly things like missing a curb. Perception is ""drinking at 7AM, leave the fellow be"" Sigh. With my Golden it is more ""What a pretty dog, I wonder if SHE is ok"". [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/WnwWSL3.jpg)

We now take a two mile walk four times a week. Good excercise for both of us.

Do stop in at /r/Parkinsons to let us know what you did for Holiday."
"Even as a friend, I'd always say ""Mind if I use your loo?""."
I think a thank you card with a thoughtful handwritten message inside would be perfect. It's something the surgeon can keep without it taking up too much space.
"Gonna have to learn sarcasm if you're gonna live here, mate."
"Dogs usually eat meat products as their main source of food, whereas horses eat grass or other plant based food. So basically the risks/sanitary considerations make horse ""unloadings"" less horrible"
Spaghetti is 20p for 500g in Lidl. Get that and a few things like tinned tomatoes etc and make a huge amount of pasta.

Yes they should definitely ask
"You weren't, I offered :-)"
"... What was the question, and why on earth would you edit it out?"
You'd round a 7.50 taxi fare up to 10 quid? Mental. I'd just round to the nearest pound. I'm not made of money.
I've smiled at people on the tube.
"Nope, we wear 3-piece suits all day every day. Even to bed. Although when in bed you are allowed to take your shoes off."
"Warning: people who moved are unlikely to admit they made a mistake because it is often too costly (not only financially) to have another attempt. You will need to factor that in when looking at the stats and comments if this is what you are after.

I moved to the UK long ago, and I genuinely believe I made the right choice, but to a certain degree my own opinion is also influenced by this difficult-to-control bias."

"In my experience it is highly variable.
 
&gt; Do I tip on a meal?

Not in a fast food outlet (McDonalds, Subway, local chippy). Usually yes in a medium to high end restaurant, though some automatically add on a gratuity to your bill. 

&gt; Do I tip on coffee?

No, not usually in a Starbucks, Costa, or other chain. Occasionally you can in independent coffee shops. 

&gt; Do I tip at a bar?

Not in my experience. Maybe yes if you're in a high end bar. 

&gt; Do I tip drivers?

You can, though it's not expected. Though most taxi drivers I've encountered are usually happier if you round up to the nearest £5 or £10 for change reasons. "
"Nope, if you find a better job leave. Its an employees market and if employers want to retain staff then they know what they can do."
"If I heard *any* noun used as an adjective, I'd assume it meant 'drunk'; from ""he's armchaired"" to ""he's John Majored""."
"If I heard ""lorried"" I'd assume it meant ""drunk"" "
"Tabloid shit-stirring, I reckon.

""Why aren't you flying a flag at half mast?""

""Well, there's no flag flown when the Queen is not resident (like now) and if she was resident, it wouldn't be appropriate to fly the Royal Standard at half mast.""

""But, but... Flags! The People's Princess! Saint Diana!"""
"You get used to doing 8 hour shifts, your future is going to be filled with a standard working day whatever job you do. Truth be told you just get on with it, hopefully you're busy and it goes quicker. "
"""Can I go to the toilet please?""  
  
""I don't know - can you?"""
"People are going to get triggered by the 'Apart from London' bit, I'm sure.

Bristol for me. Lovely balance of just about everything. Could have a house there without feeling excluded from too much. "
"I'm usually quite easy going with quick driving but if, like you say, it was too dangerous to stop, the driver was going far too fast for the conditions .

Even at a couple of mph over the limit, there's a 3 second activation time on all red before the red light camera will catch you, to alleviate the ""dilemma"" zone you have when it's at amber and you have to make a decision. 

The driver would either have to have had the world's slowest reaction time, or have been driving too quickly for the conditions. These kind of things are exactly the reason why it's mandatory to have a supervising driver as a learner.

Unfortunately I doubt there'll be any leniency around it whatsoever, if it's any consolation, it's only 3 points and a hundred quid fine or so."
"Halal on the street, hareem in the sheets"
"Reliant on an internet connection, doesn't have the full roster of box sets and films, limited number of live channels. "
"Yes!

Austria, and then Germany

Good job prospects, nicer cities to live in.

I'm unlikely to come back I spent a few months back in the UK between moving from Austria to Germany and I just can't see the opportunities back home. All the good jobs are still down in London and I don't want to pay through the nose to live in some box with an hour long commute in to work. 

Either that or I take a half decent job on a business park in the middle of nowhere which isn't exactly appealing. The political climate of the UK isn't exactly to my taste either. Don't get me wrong i'm not a fan of the CDU here in Germany either but i'd take them over the Tories any day. "
"If I saw a grown man hugging a teddy in public, I'd probably assume he had some form of developmental disability and think nothing more of it.

EDIT: That's not necessarily a bad thing, my wife and I have a vast collection of bears and rotate which get to sleep in the bed at night."
yes.

"&gt;a Tesco sandwich tastes the same as a Pret one

Sorry to say it, but something is seriously wrong with your taste buds.

Pret is probably over-priced, and I will often use a supermarket for lunch to save money, but the difference in quality is massive.

Pret makes sandwiches I would eat in a decent cafe and be happy with, Tesco makes...fuel."
"1) NationalRail

2) You don't get a choice for each journey normally (OK, so between Birmingham and London you have two choices, but unless price is a big deal really you only have one.)

3) Yes, there are tickets for effectively unlimited travel but they're very expensive.  See BritRail.  You'll likely want a TwoTogether railcard, you can Google this.  It can be bought on arrival.

4) Standard class is fine, for most journeys if you book in advance you'll have a seat reservation.

Bath and York are surprisingly similar (and both moderately far), if you can choose one over the other it might be easier (this applies to Oxford vs Cambridge too!)

Stonehenge is pointless imo, a wasted day.

Cotswolds will likely need a car, what do you actually want to see?

Tourists generally like: London (4 days+ easily), Bath (1 day), Bristol (optional, but 12 mins from Bath), Oxford (1 day), Stratford-on-Avon (1 day, see a Shakespeare play), (maybe even Warwick Castle (1 day)!).  

That's already *plenty* for a week.

Oh, and driving to Bath, Oxford, York, Cambridge is a hilariously stupid idea (FYI!)

You'll want to see the 2for1 rail offer in London, could save you a lot if managed correctly."
"A thank you card would be perfect but if it was done on the NHS the surgeon might not be able to accept a personal gift. You could always take a crate of soft drinks, some chocs and biscuits for the team break room, that always goes down really well."
"sure, but imo doing a road trip and stopping at edinburgh is bonkers - some of the most beautiful scenery in the UK is to be found in the scottish highlands - if it was me i'd be planing 5 days there at the very minimum, out of 3 weeks. "

"&gt; Sorry I am very bright. :)

Like the confidence. :-)"
"&gt; If the driver got me to destination promptly and in comfort, sure, I would consider it.

Isn't that the very basic level of service you would expect?

The level of my tip is far more impacted by the quality of the driver's banter, which is where the value-add comes into it."
They'll need to keep a noise log too.
I thought this was all one suggestion for a second then but realised it was just the sleep deprivation kicking in 
"Bite the bullet and seek professional help, make an immediate appointment with your GP and explain the situation and how you feeling and don't sugar-coat it. The fact that you made this post shows that you have a willingness to reach out for help so roll with it.

Remember that you are legally required to attend some sort of education or training(you can not fully drop out). This is the kind of thing you will really to discuss with your family and some professionals but you need to think if 6th form is the best environment for you, perhaps at least think about what else you could do.



&gt;If I were a girl, and I have poor attendance and grades were falling, they would presume something is bothering me and made sure I'm OK. Because I'm a guy, they will presume I lazy and don't care.

Look mate I appreciate that you are having issues, but that really came out of left field and you making a lot of baseless assumptions. This kind of thinking isn't going to help anybody especially you. 

P.S. Stay safe and look after yourself and remember you have people in your life who do care about you.

At the end of the day mate, it's 40 minutes.

I understand that it's an inconvenience but what exactly are you hoping to get out of them other than a profuse apology?

"Don't be a pushover and shut that shit down immediately. You have every right to peacefully enjoy your property, they have no right to disturb others constantly. I don't think you should excuse them because they're students, by the way. You can be a student and not disturb those around you.

"Take this as a learning experience.  Never allow your future employer to contact your current employer before you speak to them, make that fully clear at the interview too.  Also, its really bad form to let your employer know about a new job by receiving the reference request.

"The UK is going to be colder than you're used to, but it's not freezing cold all the time. It will almost certainly be wetter than you're used to, though. Summer and winter waterproofs will serve you well; there's nothing worse than winter waterproofs on a warm day. It's currently summer, which means that the rain gets warmer. Many people are wearing shorts and t-shirts now.

Regarding electrical items, you need to check. Our electricity is 240v at 50Hz (US being 110v at 60Hz). Many things will work - toothbrushes and other things intended for travel tend to be fairly universal, as do a lot of electronics like laptop power supplies. Many appliances will state what they can work with on the label. If you get it wrong, it could be expensive and/or spectacular."
"Personally....


&gt;Do I tip on a meal?

Only if the service was really good

&gt;Do I tip on coffee?

Not a chance 

&gt;Do I tip at a bar?

No way 

&gt;Do I tip drivers?

I'd let them keep the chance if they're friendly, usually not though

"
"I was in the NHS for over a decade; there's very little that raises team spirit more than a nice thank you card and some biscuits, donuts or cakes.  If you want to go crazy, chuck in a nice jar of coffee, and some nice tea bags.  They'll love you forever.

Make it for the whole team, rather than just the surgeon - *generally*, they're very conscious of the team they have behind them.

Don't feel like you have to spend lots of money...I wasn't even on the medical side, but had to take myself off for a quiet couple of minutes after getting a genuine thank you card once or twice.  Being acknowledged really does mean something when you spend most of the day being shouted at!"

"&gt; I was insulted (f words, stupid, lazy)

Absolutely par for the course on a building site or in the manual trades, although even now that's starting to change.

Anywhere else is probably unprofessional and unacceptable.

&gt; he grabbed my skinny arms

Sounds like assault, which is illegal.

&gt; but are bosses allowed to legally rude and physical?

Under no circumstances can a line manager assault you - that's illegal in every scenario.

As for rude... in all honesty there's a somewhat fine line between workplace banter and workplace bullying, and it's going to depend on the culture of the individual workplace.

In your own situation that definitely sounds like workplace bullying and something that I'd be wanting to speak to HR about if I were you."
