Take some class A drugs
The traditional British way - beef dripping
"McDonald's has a quality standards program comparable to the major retailers like Tesco, M&amp;S and Sainsbury's. I know the food itself is not great for you, but I'd largely trust the hygiene and food safety of McDonald's. "
"I'd just call them by their name to be honest, seems the most polite and least likely to offend. "
Your local food bank 
I'm so glad I don't go clubbing anymore 
"Nah mate, he'll phone the old bill and your mum will be getting locked up for a long time."
"Really gets on my tits. Stubborn bastards who hold their ground when there are people waiting four deep behind them, getting served one at a time.

I know locals all have their favourite spots etc but I encounter it in busy city centre pubs all the time too. Just get fucking gone, I'm thirsty!"
This [scene from Peep Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jihNDjeQGSE) will give you a pretty accurate vision of how your night is going to turn out.
Living in a coastal place I usually donate to the RNLI.
"1) It is fair to say its politics will appeal to a lot of people in this country, though to a very small minority of /r/askuk or /r/unitedkingdom. For such people, it is there to confirm their prejudices.

2) I'm going to say that most people do not buy papers for the politics, but for a package of stuff such as you find in a magazine.

The DM has a good mix of things that appeal to a lot of the population- I do not know what the average age is, but I'm guessing not young.

It has enough words that you are reading something, but not so many as to require any concentration.

We often buy it for car journeys (well, my other half reads it, I am driving) or for light reading. We never ever read any of the political articles or news."
"The problem with not trusting mainstream media is that you can easily end up with something worse.

A lot of people have conspiracy theories to sell, or political views way out to the left or right, that distort more than even our newspapers do.

It's not perfect, but we are lucky to have the BBC.  I think the best way to get news is combine that with a range of sources, across the political spectrum, and apply your own critical thinking."
"Get Ed Sheeran to come to her Mum's house with you.  Sorted.

(But if Ed is busy, I'd probably do some fairly naff ""fake ticket"" thing in Word or Powerpoint and print that out)."
"It's great, provided i can afford to import a pineapple to spread it on"
"I'd send her a bottle of wine with a thank you card or something. And being a man doesn't make a difference, it's just a nice gesture."
"If you do this, prepare yourself for pilly willy.

If anyone offers you any k, don't do it til the after party, and definitely don't do it if you're drunk, it will ruin your night."
"Write on a piece of paper guess who's going to see Ed sheeran. Tie it to a brick and throw it thorough her window. 

Or make a fake ticket saying eddy sherman and say they were surprisingly cheap. I've got one for both of us. "
That's not a local. That's when you've attended the same hovel since birth and one of the bartenders is your godfather. 
I'm not sure I could actually describe it but I reckon I could point out the American in a group of people with accuracy
"It's largely a myth that charities spend ""a lot"" on things other than the causes they are devoted to. Some things cost money - staff, renting charities shops, organising fundraising, managing many tens or hundreds millions of pounds of money is difficult and needs good people. It can't all be done by volunteers or on the cheap.

I can't speak for all the ones you list, but for example the BHF and Cancer Research UK both spend about 80% of the money they raise on the causes they back.

But, if you really are concerned about most effective bang for your buck, then I suggest checking out [GiveWell](http://www.givewell.org/), which has done studies and analysis to work out what charities can improve people's lives the most for a given sum of money. I did some research a few months back, and I now have a regular direct debit with the [Schistosomiasis Control Initiative](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/schistosomiasis-control-initiative) - unglamorous but they do good work."
"Because it represents the morals and views of a lot of people in the UK, that's the uncomfortable truth.

Edit:  Below is a long and rambling point that will just get me downvotes, but I do think is true.  

I believe that also there is an element of echo-chamber hatred of the Daily Mail, that gets out of proportion.    It's not a BNP newsletter, it is mostly a pretty decent quality newspaper.  I have *never* bought it, before you break out the downvote pitchforks, but we did used to get it at work.  Most of the paper isn't hate-spewing bile, it's a tabloid newspaper with some good columnists and some decent writing in places + some unpleasant political views and weirdly Victorian moral tone.

I guess my point is that I am no fan of the paper at all, but could find enough in it I did like to fill 30 minutes on some days.  I suspect a lot of people buy it for many reasons, columnists, sports, habit etc.  What gets highlighted online is the worst of it's content - which I do not condone at all - but that's actually just part of what you are buying for your £1 or whatever.

Ed Sheehan cd with fake ones inside. Oh god why did dad get me a cd doesn't he know I use my iPod and I already have all the songs oh ffs well he tried I suppose OPENS CD whaaaaa yaaaaaayy!
"As a result, I have also been triggered."
"It'll be fine. It's not an ideal thing to do and you may have burnt your bridges with that particular company, or a part of it, but you've got to do what's right for you. They wouldn't hesitate in pulling the role if they needed to. It's just business.

Recruiters are liars. Take everything they say with a huge pinch of salt. She's pressuring you because she'll lose out on the commission etc - she's got a right to be irritated, but guarantee she'll forget all about it within ten minutes.    "
Nah its cool as long as im not being locked up its all good
"Bear in mind that most of these massive companies are absolute dinosaurs behind the scenes; their systems are made up of a hundred different IT and non-IT systems bodged together over decades, so it's often the case that the person dealing with your case simply does not have access to the information they need or can't make the changes required. 

Quite often all they can do is put in a request with a different team, which is often no more than an email to a team's inbox. That sits there forever, gets assigned to someone who hasn't been given all the information and, as they have no access to the original system, have to send it back to get it, that kind of thing. 

Newer companies can be a lot more slick as they just don't have so much legacy crap as the old ones do. Even now the Orange and EE systems haven't been properly merged, even though as far as the public are concerned they've been the same company for years. 

The larger and older the company, the less efficient their systems (not just IT, but procedure) and the harder it is for anyone to get anything done, which often results in a bad experience from the customer's point of view. "
I'm more concerned about what dirty shit that dodgy censored chimney is up to 
"McDonald's seem to be pretty fanatical about cleanliness, I definitely agree with you on that.

Their chips aren't crispy on the outside like the BK ones though."
"Anything the yanks took over.

&gt;Cadburry's chocolate since the Kraft take over.


*Also any company blaming this and that for a reduction of size or using cheaper ingredients. 

And now I've found out Tesco will stop selling Heineken because of brexit. 

It's all went to shit. 

And an honorable mention to Amazon, after they started using their own couriers my stuff gets later and later.

"
"I get my gen from Barry down the pub.

His cousin's girlfriend's brother is in MI5 so knows what is going on."
The Scots have to keep him and his brother and their bloody Mother.
Probably the elderly and anyone else that hasn't transitioned to using the internet for everything.
"The answer is balloons mate, lots of fucking balloons..."
"John Smith for the UK, would have saved us the Blair era most likely"
All butter custard creams and water based lube? Someone's in for a good night. 
"I really enjoyed Brian Blessed as a guest host. Was a lot of fun.

I have to agree with you on Miranda Hart, the woman is a chore to watch, haven't seen Tom Hollander on it so can't comment.

I still cringe when thinking about when Piers Morgan was on as a guest and just failed abysmally to understand comedy."
"I've always preferred McDonalds chips, specifically because they're a bit droopy and soggy


/drool 


It's been too long "
Pot noodle sandwich. WTF.
"Near me, an elderly lady left 5 or 10 acres to the RSPCA with the instructions that it should be left wild for birds and animals.  The poor woman was barely cold when they had put in a planning application for houses.  Lots of protected trees but somebody turned up at 4am in the summer and felled them all in a couple of hours.

Red squirrels?  Fuck 'em."
"BBC &gt; Sky.

No ads, doesn't report rumours, and probably reliable (as every time I complain i think its biased, someone tells me they think it is biased the other way)."
Mixed race I guess? I don't really have a problem with being called white or Indian. I just call them racist anyway just because I can.
Take her to the supermarket. I don't know why but you have to start somewhere.
"You'd be sectioned, and held under the mental health act if you went into a hospital saying you were going to kill yourself.

I think you guys say ""committed"" instead of sectioned.

You'd be released when it was safe to do so, which would be a doctor's call. 
"
"Drink plenty of water (but not too much), wear layers of clothing so you can regulate your temperature. Don't get too excited and declare undying love, but don't be paranoid or aloof. 

Tell everyone the dance scene was better before Norman Cook came along."
Hold a raffle to win £600 worth of Amazon vouchers. Sell at least 121 tickets for £5 each and profit. 
"Bringing curry and/or fish as lunch to be heated in a communal microwave is a bit of a faux pas. I'm not saying it's something that you'd do, but I've definitely noticed it is done more by my colleagues from your region of the world.

One guy I work with, a second generation Bangladeshi, *always* brings fish curry for lunch. It taints everything else heated in that microwave after it. And he's always the first up to the canteen at break time, do that's *everything* anyone cooks that break."
"&gt; So should i tell my driving instructor that i have had practice so he isnt telling me stuff that I already know?

At 16 and driving round a (hopefully empty) car park, you know virtually nothing about driving. I really wouldn't worry about this. Tell him you've been behind the wheel a couple of times and you think you have a feel for driving your mum's car, but thats about it. Chances are, you'll sit in your instructors car and it'll feel different anyway."
"I worked there last year, so I can answer this.

All the tills in the pub are linked, and each employee has a till key to access them. Orders are tied to the till key, not the till itself. So if I start putting through an order on one till, I can bring it up and finish the transaction on another just by placing my till key on it and carrying on from where I left off.

While you can start placing orders and do card transactions on any till, the on duty manager has to assign you to a till before you can do any cash transactions. It literally won't give you access to the money unless you've been assigned to that till. Each person is usually assigned to only one till per shift, so that's the only till you can use to finish the transaction if they're paying by cash.

Hope that answered your question."
What the...
Jeremy Clarkson immediately after he was 'released' by the BBC was an interesting show
Alan Turing. 
"The [abortion support network](http://www.abortionsupport.org.uk) gives direct grants to cover travel and procedure costs for northern Irish and Irish women, who would otherwise be forced to continue a pregnancy and give birth due to not being able to afford to come to England for an abortion. It also gives information to women in that situation. It's a small organization that focuses on helping individuals when they are in need, preventing them from getting even further into poverty by being forced to have kids they can't afford."
"Why are you asking us? There's no law, it depends on the company. Ask your boss."
