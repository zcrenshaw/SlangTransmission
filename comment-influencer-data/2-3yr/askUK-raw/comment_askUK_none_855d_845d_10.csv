"Check out Mr Big, here. Get him. Just had to drop it into the conversation that you had a pineapple, didn't you? After Brexit we'll all have pineapples, Boris won't let us down."
uni most of europe is mainly self directed work. student have to manage the workload and do the work themselves to make the most of it.
"I would try to resolve this as best you can, but really, if they treat you like this about your wedding, they are fucking evil.  Get a new job even if you can resolve this.

And you're boss is off with stress?  Wonder why?  I would do the fucking same, from the beginning of September to after your honeymoon.  Planning weddings can be a stressful time.  (also maybe someone up the food chain will notice their staff are disappearing)

Fuck em, they're being cunts, you should too."
How does a scrub like me learn better manners **please**
"She was totally in the wrong and overstepped her authority. Next time you're there, ask her what medical training she has. If she says she hasn't got any, tell her that in the future, she is to mind her own bloody business and leave the diagnosis to the people with the letters after their names."
"I can't believe that you'd just give a pineapple to your host family. I'm not surprised you looked like a dick, waving a pineapple around like you're the big ""I AM"".  *shakes head* "
Consider contacting other relevant people in your line management as appropriate.  Generally senior approval overrides HR.
"Well if your friends don't want them I'll take em off your hands for 30 quid a pop. I can get £7 a chunk for quality pineapple on the mean streets of Henley-on-Thames. 

Just name the time and the place. "
"Get a Brick.  Door stop, foundation of a house, projectile, Fitness equipment; the possibilities are endless.

This country was built on Bricks, who wouldn't want a Brick?

You might as well buy a Brick now from a UK artisan to ensure you get a proper British brick from a a proper British Brick-Maker  instead of those cheap plastic Bricks from Denmark 'Cause when Brexit happens those Europe types will try to flood our market with cheap foreign Bricks.

Support Strong And Stable British Bricks In Brexit."
Supermarkets sell DIY kits nowadays.
"The ban is in place for a reason if you ask me, although this being a UK sub I expect massive downvoting. It's for everyone's safety and those who flaunt the prohibition are endangering not just themselves but their friends and family too. So I'll be voting for whoever upholds the ban, NHS and wars will have to take a back seat this election"
"Firstly people on Facebook are idiots generally, I mean it's a general faux pas not to stand up when someone comes to see you. But that's trumped by the ""your kids in hospital because of a thundercunt"" factor, anyone who doesn't see that is a moron. "
"Down a bit from me, somebody put a large bird box up in their front garden, and painted it yellow.  For some reason."
"Are you a union member? If so, get your union involved to assist you.

Look at your works employment policies concerning disciplinary and Grievance Rules and Procedures; Equal Opportunities Policy; Anti-Harassment and Bullying Policy. Might be worth looking at the Sickness Absence Policy; and Health and Safety Policy; as this situation sounds very stressful for you, and you might need to have the doctor sign you off for stress! Those are the policies they need to have by law, if they are a competent organisation they might have policies that cover thngs more specifically like stress etc.]

Go above HR. Talk to a sympathetic manager. Management often trumps HR. Remember that HR people often don't actually know (or care) what your specific job is. You're numbers on  a spreadsheet to them.

Ask around for precedent. Have they allowed other people time off for similar reasons. Find out why they were they allowed it and you weren't? There may be a fairness at work issue.

Finally; I know it might not be a perfect fit for you and your partner, but if you don't want to upset the HR ghouls; you could consider a midnight wedding, or a romantic sunset setting after work has finished?"
"&gt; Also does life get harder after year 11

Currently, it's likely someone else pays the rent/mortgage, bills, puts food on your table, washes your clothes, and all you've got to worry about is paying attention in school long enough to pass some exams.     Your life will never be as easy as it is now."
"My dissertation module was called ""advanced independent research project"". The whole point is for it to be your own work, so your supervisor won't necessarily help you without being asked. That said, mine was very helpful when I did ask for it "
How on earth did you get it through customs?!?
"No, God no. Onion rings go with a burger not a roast. "
"All this.  Also, leak the story to the press."
"350 pinapples A WEEK for the NHS. That'll sort out our acute scurvy. We used to eat limes, but then America made fun of us and we got self conscious... but then our teeth started falling out from the scurvy and they made MORE fun of us. 

AMERICA WHY?!?! "
"That does sound fairly typical. Your grades for the first year don't usually count towards your final result, you just need to pass (typically 40% is a pass). So some people don't try very hard in their first year and spend a lot of time partying instead. The second year does count, but only a relatively small part of the final grade. Mine was only 10%, but it was a 4 year course. I think 25% is the usual for 3 year courses.

"Tourists from many countries have a similar reputation - e.g. [Germany](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/germany/articles/German-tourists-arrogant-boring-and-nude/), [USA](https://www.quora.com/How-bad-are-American-tourists-in-other-countries), [China](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1671504/rude-awakening-chinese-tourists-have-means-not-manners). 

Some people are unpleasant, that's a universal truth. The superiority complex that many British people seem to have certainly doesn't help."
Yes
"Go to your managers manager, they're the stand in."
I noticed that this is a big difference between American and British uni. I was shocked by how little support there is from lecturers or advisers when it came to writing a dissertation. The self direction probably helps prepare students for the real world better honestly. 
"Under the Equality act 2010 it is unlawful for a company to prevent employees discussing their wages.

It's lawful for the company to ask you to keep your salary confidential to those outside the company."
"This is probably the case for, as you say, the mediocre universities. Other unis and courses, you can still have a great time, but the work starts from year 1."
"Just don't feel bad about it, they are happy as Larry to screw you over and have made it clear they don't value you, why do you feel you owe them something?"
"I think I might have the council knock at my door if I don't suggest the Isle of Wight. Lovely beaches, quiet walks, plenty of places you could stay and get away from people, (My Dad often uses air bnb to find a quiet little somewhere instead of staying in a hotel/holiday park), loads of great pubs and local historical stuff if you're into that, public transport's pretty solid in the summer, the only issue might be ferry costs, but if you're not bringing a car that'd knock it down quite a bit. 

You could jump on the train in London, be in Southampton in an hour, then on the island 45 minutes later, with a direct bus to the ferry included in your crossing fee). "
"The joke there is that Hull is shit.

Is Hull actually shit? I don't know, I've never been there, but people say it's shit.

Some other stereotypes:

* Welsh people have sex with sheep.
* Scottish people deep fry everything.
* Scousers (people from Liverpool) are criminals.
* People from Norfolk are inbred.
* People from the south of England are posh.
* People from the north of England are poor.
"
"Yeah, all of that **please**"
"Could it be that you lost weight very rapidly recently? It is not just BMI that matters. 

I am glad that you fit into ""healthy"" BMI, however perhaps she noticed something else?

Ninja edit: Perhaps something that she did not want to voice to you?  I would go in if I had time and discuss the situation with the doctor. Maybe she's just a cunt, maybe not. "
"&gt;Classes/modules seem to be toned down specifically to cater to this party lifestyle.

No.  Classes/modules are designed as part of an overall package.  If the expectations are low, it's because if you make them high, then half the students fail/drop out and your ranking as a university course slips. Drinking culture depends on the student: there are plenty who follow this 'panic in the final year pattern' and plenty who work solidly all the way through.  For every one of the latter there's a welfare tutor or a module convener or a lecturer somewhere with their head in their hands wondering how the hell they can convince young people to behave otherwise without getting bad ratings on the student surveys that have a knock-on effect for their funding.

OK, I'm half joking about the surveys/funding/reputation, but only a little.  In all seriousness, it's worth remembering that UK universities are massively more standardised than those you are used to in the USA, so in theory modules etc. are supposed to be the same amount of work in terms of hours regardless of where you study.  They are even audited, and people from outside your uni have to approve them.  But even with that in place, it's really hard to stop young people partying if they want to, and there are some negative repercussions to making them pay for the consequences.

Plus, bear in mind that most of their lecturers/tutors are the aged remnants of [Generation Peak Booze] (https://mosaicscience.com/story/peak-booze), who drank more, and partied harder, than any generation in recorded UK history.  So we get it, we really do ;)"
just take it to the college director's office. 
"&gt;In years gone by, will this be one of those great moments, like the Berlin Wall coming down?

Yeah, you might be alone in thinking that.

Good for them for having a concert, and in general the response to that horrible act has been fantastic.  It's really not in the same league as the Berlin-wall history-wise though, and I can't stand the music, so..."
You'd still be able to hear it though
"Smoke me a kipper, I'll be back for breakfast."
"The Aeropress if you drink coffee. It's £24 on Amazon at the moment but it has been under £20 before. https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Coffee-Tea-Espresso/Aerobie-AeroPress-80R11-Maker/B000GXZ2GS

I don't really understand how it makes such good filter coffee, it's magic or something, but it's really easy to use and makes great super-fast one cup coffee for those who want to use filter or grind their own beans but don't want to run a full coffee maker / make loads of cups / wait around."
I'd be incredibly wary of anyone who decided Instagram was the best place to do car insurance deals
"Ex-police.  Any political party short sighted enough to repeal Section 542A of the Tropical Poisons Reform Act (Pineapples) 2002 is asking for trouble in my opinion.  Pineapples were scheduled for a reason, trying to take us to those dark days immediately after the ""incident"" is political suicide, even for the Greens.  "
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
"""Millions of free operations carried out successfully by some of the best doctors in the world"" doesn't exactly sell newspapers. "
Obviously the Green Party are going to take a very hard line on it - I also wouldn't be surprised to see substantial prison sentences for offenders if Labour win.
"i'd mention it to the doctor too

but, its really strange OP got an appointment next day for something like that. sounds like they might be trying to fill up appointments... which is odd..."
"Because they're arseholes. It can be the only explanation.

Oh and it's *braking*, not *breaking* btw."
"In his ass, obviously!"
Every morning and then possibly in the evening depending on what I have done in the day.
Wouldn't it be awful if you developed a bout of D&amp;V a few days before your planned time off... Awful shame...
"Okay - everybody ""on the internet"" seems to have concentrated on the fact that the receptionist shouldn't have told you to make an appointment, but you did and now you're questioning it.

If you have unwittingly lost a lot of weight recently - without intending to - and it's been so much that somebody who probably doesn't see you often has noticed, then it's worth seeing your GP."
God I hope this is true 
Slow cooker. Great for dumping a load of ingredients in and having a meal ready after a long day. Very tasty to!
