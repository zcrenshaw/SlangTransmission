"The correct and full name for that sort of place would be the frolicking romp emporium, but the youth of today tend to just call it a club. "
"&gt; I got American style bacon.

Filthy heathen"
"My friend Billy  
Had a ten foot willy,  
He showed it to the girl next door.  
She thought it was a snake  
And hit with a rake,  
And now it's only two foot four."
"no.

generally quite grating. "
"We just call it a nightclub or club. I don't think the term ""dance hall"" has been commonly used since the fifties!"
Pingu was kind of a cunt. 
"I love an American accent, especially when the mouth is closed"
"It's not very vulgar, but that Spicegirls song. I'm sure there's more but what I remember is:

""If you wanna be my lover, sex is 50p, condoms are 1.50, buy one get one free-eeee"""
'Nightclub' is not a slang term.
Cheese and beans can't be beaten. 
"Seems a bit of a coincidence that your bag with iPad, Kindle etc was the one that was handed to someone else; I'd be inclined to ask them to check staff on CCTV to see if they helped themselves. Unless it was a massive misfortune it's unlikely someone would accidentally take your bag (presumably they give them back only with tickets, not 'thats mine with the iPad sticking out') so my guess would be dishonest cloak room staff rooting through bags to decide which to pinch. Too obvious to just take the contents if no-one else is behind there but them, so best to just say they lost it. Possibly that's why you haven't heard back from the owner too. "
"If I'm at home, I'll have pudding. If I'm eating out, it's dessert."
"Royal Mail will take it seriously, they alway have when I've contacted them. Contact HQ and your local delivery office. 

But, state it as 'missing', giving facts. Don't say 'theft' unless you have actual proof. Let them investigate. 

Get your neighbours to do the same if they have experienced it.

You could let local rag know?

BTW, my bank cards never come with RM, always with a courier."
Are you talking about the discotheque? People don't realise how many loan words we took when the Normans invaded.
"I dunno, that's a bit formal. Even if we were being a bit posh we just called it the Frompium. I agree most would probably just use ""club"" now though."
"I am not a lawyer but consumer law states that the nightclub must take reasonable care.  They didn't and are liable.

https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/dec/04/what-are-your-rights-if-a-cloakroom-loses-your-coat

&gt; When you pay for a service, like a cloakroom service, under consumer law, you enter into a contract with the provider, which means theyâ€™re required to take reasonable care of your goods and perform the service with reasonable care and skill
"
What narrative are you trying to spin OP? If you rewind to the 12:00 mark you can clearly see the seal got what he deserved. 
"Pingu was just a product of his environment. His parents blatantly favoured his younger ~~brother~~ sister, which can have long-term effects on a penguin's mental health. 

Pingu wanted nothing more than his mum's approval: http://imgur.com/tuJwoeu.png &amp; here we see Pingu being forced into child labour: http://imgur.com/cWfZY9I.png

Kinda lucky he didn't grow up to do ice.

"To the Barney ""I love you"" tune:

&gt;I hate you  
You hate me  
Let's tie Barney to a tree  
With a knife through his guts  
And a bullet in his head  
Sorry kids, but Barney's dead."
"They have to be approved by the highways department of the council before you do it as well. Some friends of mine managed to get their house named as ""Far Corfe View"". Only once the approval went through did someone say it outloud (fuck off you) and complain to council - but by then it was too late. "
"It's pretty fucking stupid, that's for sure"
"I can find them annoying to be honest. And if I'm brutally honest, people from the south can sound uneducated..."
"I wouldn't necessarily go in and say 'I have anxiety' straight off the bat. It's up to the doctor to make that diagnosis. You may find it more productive to say 'I'm concerned I may be suffering from anxiety because of these symptoms. I have tried to cope with them by doing this, but I no longer feel that is effective and the problem is affecting my life in this way'. You want to get across three main points:

* what your symptoms are

* how it affects your daily life

* what you have already tried to help

Obviously going to the doctor can make you anxious in itself, so you may find it helpful to jot down a reminder to yourself and take it with you, and to make a double appointment if you feel you have a lot to say.

Often they then want you to fill in a self survey to formalise what you've said. Don't be surprised if they also ask what social support you already have in place. They should then discuss the options available to you and probable waiting times in your area. This may involve referral, or they may decide with you that this is something they can help you manage. Don't be afraid to ask questions, and remember to ask what you should do if the problem worsens."
My mum's fucked if the police ever go round and look through my baby album. 
"If you want to see this to its conclusion then you MUST inform the Police asap.

Without a 'crime reference number' there's little you can do...

https://www.gov.uk/your-rights-after-crime

... report this to the police, gets your crime reference number, then call the club back and then finally write your letter including your crime reference number to them."
"It's fine but if there are other cars around you should be doing a little light breaking, just enough to put the lights on as a signal you are slowing down"
"&gt;My dad is telling me that ""a degree is a degree"", and that I should finish it.

kinda correct.

now that you've sunk in cash for two years, it would be a good idea to complete the best you can, then find a job. lots of jobs just need a degree not always in a specific subject.

bail now, and that cash is wasted. (plus not sure you can get a loan to start another degree ?)

do another year, and it opens up better jobs or post-grad in a different subject which you'd prefer.

work your balls off, this isn't meant to just be ""fun"", a third year is hard work and you have to get down to it, nail a first.  do extra shit, get to know the teaching staff and see if they can open up opportunities. "
"No- those are NOT the right kind of sausage, because they are cured.

Where are you? Are you not in the UK? If you are in the UK, you can just ask any employee person in a supermarket.

You do get the odd named terraced house. But its mainly detached and semis usually
This is not true. OP: please ignore this
Not sure I'd take a gift at all if it's a casual verbal invite and your SO isn't invited...! A card would suffice IMO.
"&gt;an unnamed person had money stolen and transferred into our new account, and withdrawn

I very much beg your pardon Mister Bank manager, but could you explain *how* someone other than myself drew money out of *my* account? Oh, you don't know? Well why don't you go an find out? Right fucking now! And while you are doing that, perhaps pull up the CCTV of the person that made the withdrawal, like you should have done before you called the police?"
"There was one that went something like

&gt; When it comes out your bum like your pedigree chum

&gt; Diarrhoea! Diarrhoea!

&gt; Jingle Bells, Batman Smells, Robin flew away

&gt; Uncle Billy lost his willy on the Motorway

and 

&gt; Beans, beans, they're good for your heart

&gt; Beans, beams they make you fart,

There was also something that started with:

But I can't remember the rest of it

Edit 2: Not particularly vulgar but just remembered this one:

&gt; On top of spaghetti, all covered in cheese

&gt; I lost my poor meatball, when somebody sneezed

&gt; It rolled off the table

&gt; and onto the floor

&gt; and then my poor meatball rolled out of the door

&gt; it rolled down the garden

&gt; and into a bush

&gt; and then my poor meatball, was nothing but mush"
"&gt; BTW, my bank cards never come with RM, always with a courier.

Who do you bank with? I'm with Nationwide and everything comes through Royal Mail"
"No, assuming the context is non sexual. Nudity is not necessarily pornography.

If a parent has pics of their kids playing in the bath tub, its not sexual so its fine. But if someone completely unrelated has those same pictures in a large collection of pictures of other naked kids, hidden away on their hard disk, then its a lot more suspicious."
