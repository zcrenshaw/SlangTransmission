"How about the fact that Shakespeare coined the most words in the English language, including coining the word 'coin', which has a literal meaning of creating a new term to define an unnamed concept. "
I thought all Italian was vulgar when spoken.
"There were three POWs together in a British prison in the Second World War, a German, a Japanese, and an Italian.

The British began by torturing the German. After long hours of silence infected by bloodcurdling screams, he talked, and was sent back to the prison, ashamed. He told the others what he had done and urged them to be stronger than he was.

They next began torturing the Japanese man. Through all the pain and agony, he stayed strong for three days, but in the end, talked. He was sent back to the prison, having brought shame to himself, his family, and his country.

They finally sent in the Italian. For an unending three weeks, they tortured him, until they realized if they did anything else to the poor man, he would die, so they sent him back. When he got back to the prison cell bloody and battered, the other POWs asked him, ""So? Did you talk?""

""How could I talk with my hands tied behind my back?"""
Don't describe yourself as Scottish/Irish/whatever just because your great great grandfather was. 
"Only imported ones, as indigenous European buffalo don't have wings."
"Even if he didn't invent them, they're in use today because of him, which is a pretty monumental achievement, considering its been 400 years"
"I don't tip. I don't believe in it. I don't tip because society says I have to. Alright, I mean I'll tip if somebody really deserves a tip. If they put forth the effort, I'll give them something extra. But I mean, this tipping automatically, it's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned they're just doing their job."
"Electorally, England is softly conservative. Generally. Labour victories happen when they shift right or the Cons cock up. 


The country is full of people who want us to be fiscally conservative but socially make right noises about helping people (but only the right type of people). The public are shockingly influenced by the News Corp narratives, though this is not aided by the Labour party's utter incoherence and idiocy. 


On that topic, Labour party members (of which I am one) are morons. Students, socialists, delusional ex-commies, pointless hippies and some decent people thrown in for good measure. Unfortunately, a good chunk think they can win elections by preaching to the converted, rather than to the 10m undecideds. Sadly, this will now consign Labour to the political dungheap for the next 9 years as people would rather protest a Tory government than form a moderate Labour one.


Oh, and with the imminent breakup of the union, Labour may well be fucked for all eternity if they don't veer right."

"BEING REALLY FUCKING LOUD IN PUBLIC.

Seriously, turn it down.

Then turn it down again."
"You can wear carrier bags for socks if you want, dress how you like.

BUT I had it drilled into me when I was a kid to not wear white socks with black shoes and I still live by that"
"Lots of Americans don't realise quite how loud they are compared to Brits. In tourist hotspots you'll see a lot of American tourists obliviously yelling at each other in a cafe and drowning out nearby conversations. 

You might want to bear that in mind, especially if you're visiting anywhere people tend to be hushed, like an art gallery or a church."

"As a Brit, this is really illuminating. I'd likely normally complain of too MUCH ice put in drinks, it dilutes the beverages - and I'd never really noticed the lack of choice in shops until going to the States and I'd never stand up and call our public transport ""amazing"" for fear of being laughed out my house!  

The rest of your observations are completely on point though!"
"Not necessarily *rude* but if someone says they're from Yorkshire, don't say ""Oh I know a guy called John from London, do you know him?"". Everyone will think you're disturbingly stupid. They won't be offended, they'll just laugh at you."

a Routing Number is a silly American invention.  Real banks don't use it.
"The quality is generally excellent. Also lots of strange/interesting stuff (which is where most people get carried away and spend more)

Most stuff is about the same price for the quality. They have the Essentials range but this is better than Tesco Value in quality, so isn't that cheap, its about normal price.  

Bakery is same price. Milk same. Normal veg same. Deals on beer/wine.

They [price match tesco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waitrose#Price_matching)

It *appears* more expensive because they don't stock the cheap nasty stuff.

Plus the [staff get treated like proper humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waitrose#Employment_practices_and_benefits), which is worth it alone by my book"
"I love how these ""coined"" terms are now regarded as [household words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_Words).  Now, who do we credit for making them so?  Shakespeare or Dickens?

"Mostly he's fucking awful at everything a modern professional politician needs to be able to do

He wears a suit like someone who's borrowed one for a job interview

He can't manage to craft a sound bite suitable for modern media

He has employed a team of ideologues with no experience running a political office, making it hard to tell if it is actual malice or simple incompetence to explain the messes they keep on making

He's what happens when you give a hard job to someone who's never had the experience to be ready for it

"With the greatest of respect, Medicine is massively competitive and massively stressful - I've known people in the best of health who have struggled with the workload and the pressure.

If you have active depression, anxiety, dissociative disorder and are currently self-harming then - and I mean this with the best of intentions - I don't think that studying Medicine would be the best and most positive decision for you at this moment.

The Occupational Health screening is there to benefit you as well as the University, and it's designed to highlight people who not only might need extra assistance, but people who might not be able to cope with the workload and the pressure in general.

The institution will know more about the workload and the course than you will and they really are best placed to make a decision as to wether it will be in your own best interests or not to allow you entry on the course.

Please don't lie, because you won't be doing yourself any favours if you lie your way onto a course that you're not medically fit for.

I know this is likely not the answer that you are wanting to hear, but I would encourage you to fill it in with honesty and openness and be prepared to discuss all your current conditions and treatment plans with the University.

Mental Health problems aren't the end of the world and I know many people who have overcame theirs and went on to be highly successful in their chosen careers, but that's because they took the time to focus on their recovery first before jumping headfirst into something that they weren't ready for."

"The word quaint is offensive.

Sharing your opinions on religion, politics and other hot topics is also rude. If you must talk, you can discuss the weather."
"Fanny is as old as the hills, but people don't tend to use it in polite conversation."
If there's a problem with your food you *should* complain. It would be ridiculous to put up with it for fear of causing a scene. Just be polite about it.
"Saying the word ""fanny"". "
"&gt; The variable number of lessons seems very confusing. How did you keep track of which lessons you had on that day?

You get a timetable every September and have to carry it round all year, referring to it most days if you don't learn it. I'm 29 and still have nightmares about forgetting my timetable sometimes."

"There's a lot more colloquialisms from that era than Shakespeare recorded, but the ones he used have a far higher preservation rate than those he didn't; generations upon generations reading him in schools as one of the core bodies of work within English literature can't help but keep those specific phrases in our collective vocabulary. "
"If this a a reoccurring problem, get help. Professional help. This is above our pay grade."
Nope. It feels weird.
"Based on most of my interactions with hr departments over the years if you're able to be as awkward, unhelpful and condescending as possible you'll fit in nicely "
I've always been told that white socks with trainers is fine. But white socks with any smart/smart casusal shoe is right out. And no socks with sandals... Or you look like a British Tourist.

"So I moved to London to do a one-year MBA program.  While I was here, I met my husband, got married, and stayed.  I've been here three years now.

I was super excited to go, I had visited Europe before but never lived there, but also at the time assumed it would be something temporary.  For me, London didn't feel all that different than a big American city at first.  The difference between American and British culture are subtle and it took me a while to see them.  I didn't really start to miss the US until I'd been here about a year, when all of the little differences started to add up.  I occasionally still get pissed off about something minor, like:

* You have to flag down waiters if you want them to bring you anything - water, food, the bill, anything.

* No one, not even the movie theaters, ever puts enough fucking ice in my drink.

* Portions of food are smaller, and the carb to protein ratio is way higher.

* Grocery stores have a much smaller selection of foods.

* Even in a house, you will share walls with your neighbors and hear all their music and television.

* The sidewalks are too small!!

But there's tons of good things that make up for it!  Like:

* The public transit is amazing.

* People are super friendly and accepting of every culture and lifestyle.  I get into conversations with strangers at pubs all the time.  

* Towel warmers!!

* The healthcare system takes some practice to navigate, but works quite well once you have it down.

* The lifestyle is nice.  Way more vacation days, and much more emphasis on the work-life balance.  

* The government is actually really easy to deal with.  gov.uk is actually written in English, not legalese like the US govt websites.    

So for me anyway, the only tough part is missing out on minor conveniences that are common in the US but rarer here.  I don't really miss living in the US.

"OK, this is a second hand story. My friend worked at a Sports Direct in Middlesbrough in the late 90s. He said that Paul Merson came looking to buy some boots for his son. He selected the cheapest in the shop and then asked for a discount because he was Paul Merson. He also stank of piss.

This doesn't really have anything to do with Sports Direct, I just love telling that story."
"Say please, thank you and sorry. A LOT. More than that. "

"The idea that Labour hasn't managed to get elected with a fully left wing leader in a long, long time while Blair sacrificed that with ""new labour"" and got elected. "
"Just to add, don't panic with any of these though. People will realise you're American and cut you some slack/not judge you too harshly if you're e.g. overly friendly or upbeat. It's not neccessarily how people behave here, but we expect it in Americans and it can be charming."
"Nope. I paid for the pizza. How the business distributes money to its employees is its business.

I might feel different if pizza wasn't so damn dear."
"It sounds insanely patronising when an American tourist calls your home town or something where you live ""quaint"". It sounds like you're talking to a child about a story they just told you."

"Calling someone/something out. Eg, if there's a problem with your food in a restaurant, *don't* go loudly complaining and making a scene. 

The British way is to eat the food, tell the waiter it was great, then go home and complain to friends and family. 

If you *really must* complain, wait to catch a waiters eye, gesture them to you, and quietly explain what the issue is and what you would like done about it. Basically, if the table next to you gets the idea you're unhappy, you're doing it wrong. "
