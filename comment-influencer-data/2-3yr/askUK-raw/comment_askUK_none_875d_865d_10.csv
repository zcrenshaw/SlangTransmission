"&gt;Does anyone seat you? 

No

&gt;Do you pick a random empty table and hope someone notices you? 

No

&gt;How do you get food? 

Ask for it at the bar

&gt;The invisible waitstaff, or ordering at the bar? 

Don't try to order from invisible staff, many of our pubs are haunted and you'll just get bread rolls thrown at you by poltergeist

&gt;If the latter, how do I get a menu (I don't want to admit I've e-stalked this place for 4 days, and already know the menu quite well)?

Ask the bar staff


&gt; Is anyone going to look at me funny if I order a drink that isn't alcoholic while in a pub?

No, not at all.

Don't be stressed - just walk up to the the bar, and explain what you want."
"Theresa May would obviously be May-tilda.

"They didn't want to- as in any thorough textual analysis, context is key. In this instance, the addition of ""psyche!"" to the end of the line serves to highlight that they recognise that damaging their equipment would be a hindrance to their performance- they said it as a joking comment to ""psyche"" you out, as was the vernacular and popular phrasing of the era. This can also be seen in the use of ""...not"", as popularised by the hit comedy movie series ""Wayne's World""."

No guns. Free healthcare. No radical Christians. Real football (not hand egg). Don't have to drive approx 7 billion miles to go where you want too.

"No, what you got was a talking to. 

A Police Caution is a formal warning, and there's no way you could be given one without fully understanding that you were getting one.

"OK, I am the token Theresa May fan from /r/unitedkingdom.

tl;dr older people find her familiar, sincere, trustworthy and reassuring. The words 'strong and stable' come to mind, dunno why.

Here's an edited copypaste of my answer from this thread 2 mths ago:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/5vvrvd/with_more_than_6_months_in_office_what_is_your/

For me, she's doing her best in unimaginably difficult circumstances, and I can't imagine any other British politician doing better.

I continue to believe she is fundamentally a C of E (after all vicar's daughter) blue-stocking, 19th century one-nation Tory, and that her concerns for social justice are genuine.

For reference, I am older than most in this sub, I suppose I am centre-left, I have voted Labour every election except 1992 (starting from the 1979 one) and am voting Labour in June. I voted Remain and think Brexit is a scary disaster. I am not white. 

May was a type of girl I was very familiar with growing up (she's just too old for me to have had any chance of knowing her as a student). Elsewhere, I have enlarged on how when I was young, I saw a generational shift in public policy and beliefs (interesting article recently in the Guardian, discussed in /r/unitedkingdom, on all the many people who did PPE at Oxford now prominent in public life) on which Blair (though older than May) and Cameron and their ministers were very much on the more modern side, and May is on the more traditional side.

So for me, she has been a very reassuring and dignified figure. I especially like the fact she keeps her distance, does not tell anyone anything, but I can see that this can only be seen as positive if one starts off with the intuition that she is trustworthy and trying to do the best for the country.

She has actually been my favourite PM of my sentient lifetime (starting with the first Wilson government). So far she still is. But anything could happen in the next few years.

What will I feel about her if the UK does badly out of the Brexit talks? Will I feel she was personally to blame or will I feel she was dealt an impossible hand and the weakness of the opposition did not help? I do not yet know.

"I almost called in. I was flipping through the channels and paused on one of these. Amongst the wall of text around the edge of the screen there was a 'sexy' message-

"'anti-social noise hours' in the UK are 11pm-7am.  That said, if you cut the lawn at 7am I will scream at you like a fishwife from the bedroom window.

I once saw what I thought was a pineapple but it turned out to be a zesty hedgehog with a funky haircut instead. 
"I think people underestimate just how *insanely* cheap shipping at scale is.

If you want to read about the technicalities of shipping pineapples (you smuggler!), the Germans have a good (English language) document: http://www.tis-gdv.de/tis_e/ware/obst/ananas/ananas.htm"
"One thing I've not seen other people mention: people like this thrive by pushing boundaries and not having anyone else push back. The more nobody says anything, the more normal his behaviour seems and the less people will worry about it. ""Oh, that's just his way."" ""Yeah, it makes me a bit uncomfortable, but I don't think he'll *do* anything."" I've seen this happen in my wider friendship circle and am ashamed I didn't stand up to it sooner - no individual instance of creepiness to far enough to call out in the moment, but each one is a tiny bit creepier than the last. 

On top of all the other advice on talking to HR and trying to ensure she has family looking out for her and such, I'd recommend that you start directly challenging this guy. Next time he says that she's ""The most beautify *her job title*"", look him dead in the eye with an expression like he's just said something crazy or disgusting (which he has) and call him out on it. ""What the hell makes you think that's an appropriate thing to say at work, K?"" or ""That's a really creepy thing to say about someone a third of your age.""

He may try to deflect, or he may get angry. Whatever happens, stand your ground - *he* is the one breaching the social contract and trying to twist other people's inaction to his gain. *He's* in the wrong. Don't put up with it. And every time he does it, make a comment. Escalate your open disgust at what he's saying. Make it publically clear that you think what he is doing is *wrong*. 

It doesn't take long of someone making a stand for all the other people who think this is wrong to break out of their shell and agree. But it takes *someone* doing it. So do it. Break the spell. "
"Do your manual licence unless for some reason it's not possible; having an auto licence is extremely limiting in the future if you ever need to rent a car or van, for example. "
"He's saying keep your religion as a personal thing. There are many religious people in the UK but as a rule it's something they do quietly in their own time, without forcing their beliefs upon other people.

In my experience many Americans do exactly the opposite, it being a country where the religion you belong to is almost as divisive and important as the colour of your skin."
Wait till after 10. People have being looking forward to that lie in all week. People who make a noise before 10 on a weekend are inconsiderate pricks.
As I mentioned on a thread about what people miss from the UK I'd say you can't beat British pubs. 
"If you're making that sort of noise at 7am you've waived your right to politeness.

ETA: maybe also look up 'hyperbole'.."
"Because as soon you kill immigration you expose the nasty truth that it wasn't that big a problem and just a convenient scapegoat for lack of proper investment.   The NHS would grind to a halt because we don't train enough Doctors and Nurses, and those we do train we undervalue so that use their new found skills to emigrate to countries like Australia that'll pay them what they are worth.  The housing crises will remain because we're still not adequately investing  proper social housing at the bottom of the housing ladder.  Crime won't suddenly decrease because, frankly, most crime is committed by the 60 million already in this country.  And, of course, it's hard to point a finger a blame the evil EU for all these immigrants if we don't have any in this country to point at. "
"Go up to the bar, say you want to eat.

I don't know what will happen next because pubs have different practices.

Some (such as the Wetherspoons chain) require you to first find a table, on which there is a number, and then to tell them which table number you are. 

Other pubs (upmarket ones, informally called ""gastropubs""), will come to you if they see you sitting at a table. They won't at all mind you approaching the bar first (they're used to it), but they might well then expect you to go and find a table, or even direct you to one. "
As much as I'd love to try one I wouldn't dare buy a whole pineapple. Sometimes a Polish shop near me sells rings in unmarked tins and even buying those makes me nervous. Whoever runs that co-op isn't going to have a job for very long
"Me too, thanks"

"The reason people think she's a 'strong leader' is because they keep repeating the phrase 'strong and stable'.

Those people who are susceptible to such tricks will end up believing that the Tories are the only ones who can offer strong and stable leadership of the country. Unfortunately, that seems to be a good proportion of the population.

EDIT: Alright, downvoters. Watch the next interview with any Tory and count how many times they say the phrase 'strong and stable'."
The system works!
"You'll be arrested, definitely."
"About a decade ago a couple of friends of mine rang babe station after a night in the pub just for shits and giggles. There was a couple of girls on the screen and my mates were just asking random questions like What did you have for you tea? and What's your favourite biscuit. The rudest question was Has either of you farted while in the studio? Where one proceeded to laugh and point at the other saying she'd been at it all night. My mate said it's the least sexual thing he's ever done with a girl with just a thong on.
"
I believe your ticket price barely covers the cost of the film that the cinema pay to show it. At least in the first week or two anyway so they use food/drink to actually make money.
"They will presumably also have overheads that you haven't considered. The price seems fairly reasonable to me for a couple guys, a van and at least 2 hours labour"
You'd have to balance that with the fewer lane closures due to accidents and fewer queues forming due to the effect of someone suddenly braking having a ripple effect on the car behind.
That's because you're at the bread counter. You need the pizza counter right next door
Take a Vitamin D supplement. 
I think we need to let the good people at r/nca and r/policeuk aware.  You're putting us all at risk you selfish bastard.  Pineapples were banned for a reason!
"No, in fact, *aww hell no*.

There is some basic economics about what makes a good currency area.  Definitely stuff an A-Level student would cover, and arguably GCSE too.  The Euro was meant to help meet these with tests for alignment of economies.  Well, they missed them, so they lied and fudged the tests or ignored them.

Whatever problems the UK has had in the last 7 years would have been far worse in the Euro.  For example, the Eurozone never really got behind Quantitive Easing, because of the historic German fears over inflation.  As such, the UK recovered from 2008 much more quickly.  And if you think our austerity was bad, see what Greece/Ireland/Spain/Portugal had to live with.

I imagine if we had gone in the result to get out would have been a landslide for Leave.  

I write this a Remain voter, albeit one who has always believed the EU had major flaws.  In fact, the Euro (tied with the CAP) is basically the worst part of the EU for me.  It's politics over intelligence and reason."
"Loud, obnoxious, and prone to glorifying violence... But thats enough about people from Liverpool. "
This is a scam the coop have been doing for a while now. It's probably a pinecone with a bit of grass stuck to the top. 
I like flying back to the UK from holiday and seeing our green patchwork quilt of a country. The people are cool for the most part. We have a police service not a police force. Our dry whit and sarcasm is legendary. Most shit can be solved with the application of a cup of tea.
Oh no. You're not getting away with it that easily.

"I'm from Jersey (so not a _true_ B.O.T but still not part of the UK, so I'll answer anyway)

I am very heavily patriotic towards the UK xD I'm Scottish by blood but am a Unionist &amp; Royalist. The vast majority of people here look favourably on the mainland, but we quite enjoy having little to do with many of the mainland's issues.

If you're interested to know roughly where I think Jersey lies on the political spectrum, I reckon it would be the _ultimate_ tory safe seat."
"&gt; Some historical places? A cozy pub? Some nice parks may be?

......are none of the things you will find in Luton. 

My advice would be to get on a 25 minute train to Central London and spend a couple of hours there instead :) Kings Cross station in London is a 10-15 minute walk to the British Museum.

"Oddly, the weather. Each day is a surprise. All types of weather bring back good memories of when the weather was similar, kinda like smells. "
"As a 32 year old Brit (primary school from 88 to 95) who grew up poor as fuck. Pretty much every single school meal contained chips. At least at secondary school where I had a choice. Primary school if I recall correctly was things like shepherd's or cottage pie and some kind of veg. Desert was king, jam Roly poly with custard. As I say secondary school was pizza and chips, burger and chips, turkey fucking twizlers and chips. Basically some form of shit deep fried battered protein and chips, often served with baked beans. Not the beans you know, Heinz baked beans (although school would serve a cheaper variety.) As for home, my mum was Glaswegian and we're from the north. Sausage casserole, mince and tatties, bacon hot pot, corned beef hash. Basically British peasant food. To be fair a lot of it is pretty tasty but it's really fucking not good for you. Findus fucking crispy pancakes! Poor people in my experience who couldn't cook like my mam (and with that said thinking back we are a lot of this shit too) ate a lot of cheap processed food like the afore mentioned pancakes or potato waffles or frozen pizza or chips, so many fucking chips. To be honest I think I probably had it pretty good for a council estate lad in the 90s. A lot of what I ate was basically carrot, potato and onion with bistro gravy granuals and cheap cuts of meat and it can be pretty tasty but it's not great for you. I don't really crave any food I ate as a kid except for some winter nights when it's dark and cold and raining nothing will quite hit the spot like corned beef hash, pickled red cabbage and some thick buttered crusty bread. I find it hard to see a character like me looking back of the food of their youth with passion and excitement talking about how it made them want to be a chef, more like looking back with shame and disgust and wanting to be a chef so they'd never have to eat that shit again!   
  
On a Sunday we would have a proper full English breakfast. Fuck yes. And before school my Grandma would make French toast, or at least what I call French toast which is a piece of Warburton's bread dipped in egg whisked with milk and shallow fried and then she'd mix ketchup and brown sauce in a side dish and you'd dip the bread in. Damn that shit was tasty. Honestly most of my adult life has been spent trying to learn how to eat better because that kind of diet does not leave you in good shape! I should point out though this answer is going to be very regional and will differ a lot from family to family. I am from the North West but the diet I grew up on would be most likely considered Glaswegian or more broadly Scottish. Also cabbage, lots of slimy fucking disgusting cabbage."
"The 'perfume' (bergamot) may be unfamiliar for some, the tea wouldn't traditionally be drank by those in the lower classes during work (e.g. detectives.)  It's more traditionally associated by 'upper' classes relaxing.

Regardless, it's a decent enough tea and enjoy it if you like the taste, don't get hung up on historical associations.  You may also like Lady Grey."
