Australia is actually pretty nice now.
"Mum. 

Mama only when I've killed a man. "
"You lot couldn't successfully invade cuba, let alone a nuclear armed state"
"Black Friday. 

That shit needs to die."
Our government isn't perfect but there is absolutely zero reason that we would ever want to become a US state. More chance of Donald Trump opening the border with Mexico
Mate I can smell you from here
"Personally, I don't recall a single occasion - no matter what the group involved - on which the question ""Are we going for starters?"" has not been asked by someone shortly after the menu arrives.

There will then be a short discussion and some kind of consensus reached long before actual choices are made and orders are placed."
Welcome to adulting.
"WTF are you babbling about?

There are far more than 3 parties. You clearly have absolutely no idea how commons works, suggest actually reading up.

&gt; Would the UK join the USA as a state?

hell no. no way. never. 

ugh"
"You should call the police straight away on 101 and report that your father is continuing to drive obviously he is a serious risk to himself and others, they may impound the car but won't prosecute your father if he has diminished responsibility.  

You should also contact your local council and refer him to Adult Social services as this is an Adult safe guarding issue, they will carry out an assessment and hopefully provide support and services."

ON purporse, BY accident"
I like that the Atlantic is between us and them.
Why would anyone in their right mind want to join the US?
Oi
"""Could care less"" really gets on my nerves.

One of my friends refers to her fringe as her ""bangs""

On the other hand, I think that British English should scrap ""Zed"" for ""Zee"" as the pronunciation of the letter Z. That's the only thing I'm going to give them though."
"Set both of your mood lights to ""calm"" and wait... 

Amazon are pretty good with this sort of issue..."
"In all probability, she'll get a nice headed letter from a Civil Servant, which probably won't be entirely bland insomuch as it will directly refer to her message.


That said, you never know... "
No idea what you are talking about. 
"We don't want to join your shitshow thanks.

And you've completely misunderstood. "
"In ascending order of panic

MOTHER"
"No, she's been wanting to push through something like this for years. Now 'call me Dave' Cameron is out of the way, she's pressing ahead. 

She's always been like this. A pushy moralist with an authoritarian streak. I can't find an exact quote but she famously complained that ""human rights"" get in the way of government. Showing that she perfectly understands the purpose of human rights (to stop the government doing whatever it likes) and opposes them for that very reason.

And she's terrible at following legal advice. The only home secretary in recent history to have been found [in contempt of court](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/9345345/Theresa-May-accused-of-unacceptable-and-regrettable-behaviour-by-judge.html). She nearly went to prison just so she could keep some guy in an immigration detention centre after a court had ordered him released. She's pressing ahead with an appeal on the Brexit case despite members of her own party telling her to stop embarrassing herself.

She's not the political genius people make her out to be. She's very clever but she has huge blind spots."
"Inside, baseball is a bad idea."
"Change the radio station you're listening to.

I've got a mate who lets me use his Costco card... 
"In my experience it means they're willing to pay the market rate, but they'll gladly give you a shitty salary unless you push for a decent amount. 

That, or they'll pay the going rate but they're underpaying someone else in the role right now. "
Witches can't smell me if I am dirty
"Use a similar domain name and stick some Google Ad spending behind it. Make sure you verify the pub on Google My Business, get it on Google Maps, etc so Google ranks it highest as the legitimate website in searches. Also helps having an active Facebook and Twitter account and following, which again will appear near the top of search results."
"Make your classmates go on a 'quiz show' you host where they have to guess whether or not something was invented/created in the U.K. (Telephones or toilets or Harry Potter or lord of the rings or whatever, do fact check the first few cause I'm not 100% on them) Give out British sweets to victors. Done. "
I'm not sure what the NATO rules are on one NATO country invading another. Maybe America will go to war with itself to protect the UK?

"Are you 7?

I hope the quality of Americans we get on /r/AskUK is not representative of the population, they're always so stupid."
"All they're listing are the sites visited, not which pages etc - this can be good and bad. No, they can't see what pictures you've been looking at on Facebook, or that you've been stalking your ex on Instagram. 

However say for example on Reddit, someone posts a link to an article on howtobuildexplosives.com and you click the link to see what they're on about - it's now on file, for a year, for pretty much any government service to see - that you visited that site. Nobody knows why, but that's now on record. So there's that. 

Secondly, there's the issue that sooner or later, they *will* end up monetising it by selling your data to third parties, it's just the way all these things go. 

Thirdly, the government are absolutely awful at implementing systems like this properly, which means it'll be woefully insecure. The fact it can be accessed without a warrant means that your internet browsing history might as well be public knowledge. Say you've been looking at job sites, dodgy (but legal) porn, whatever.  Would you want people being able to hold you to ransom with that info? Because it's technically possible. 

But my main gripe is that it's a sledgehammer to crack a nut. What are they trying to do here? Yeah possibly you could keep tabs if people visit certain dodgy websites or be able to track someone with a warrant if they're suspected of a specific crime, but to store the records of every person in the country for a year without their permission is some real moronic 1984 nonsense.

Write me.

"Lipton..... that's

Only those in their alt-right minds.  (sorry couldn't resist)
"""In 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them....maybe you can hire The A-Team."""
So basically she works in a shop and wants to fly home for Christmas?  No manager with half a brain is going to believe that for a second.  If going home is that important to her then she needs to quit and just go.  Its not as if crappy minimum wage retail jobs are hard to come by.
"Day-drink like *druuuuunk*, or day-drink like a couple of pints?

The latter, probably nearly every week.  A pint or two of a Sunday afternoon in the local pub is a damn fine way to relax.  (Can replace ""Sunday"" with another day as my schedule suits"")

Ditto a Sunday lunch with family with liberally flowing wine.

Riggedy-riggedy-wrecked day drunk, basically never - but I also have kids."
"If you're hoping to make money it's not a hobby.

Hobbies are supposed to drain you of all your spare cash. You spend hundreds if not thousands on rare lego sets, old or modern radio transmitting equipment, model trains, remote controlled sailboats, camera lenses, rare books, etc."
"I trust them to be incompetent, in fact so incompetent that any attempt to set up a truly oppressive system would not work."
addicting
Mum is the broadest used term.
"Caw me an Englishman again, I'll rip yer baws aff"
"I love how they're totally not sexist at all, and never get confused about the difference between the UK and England."
"Boring answer, but for me it's got to be the chicken tikka masala."
"No that's something different again. Craic is fun or good  banter, more used in Ireland "
"Personally, I must admit to more or less lumping them all in together.

I guess you just see the big white caravans appear where caravans should not be and ""it's the gypsies"".

Near my wife's parents house, there are often some painted wooden wagons with horses next to them grazing by the side of a (fairly busy) road.  Believe they are genuine travellers.  I'll admit to being shallow enough that I've thought they are probably OK, because they've got a nice twee wagon.

New Age Travellers aren't really a thing, are they?  I guess maybe if you count couch-surfing or squatting ""crusties"", we all probably vaguely know a few white guys with dreads who fit that bill.

"Your thermometer is broken. Either the one in your house or the one in your body. 10C is freezing, you couldn't be comfortable at that temperature.

Why do you have a social worker? If you live with vulnerable people you really need to put the thermostat on at 16 or 18 as an absolute minimum. 20 is average.

Personally I feel like anything under 22 is too cold for indoor temperatures."
"No idea.

But just have your daughter send the card (directly to TM, not to the Conservative party). Warn her that TM is really busy running the country and probably won't reply, but tell her she'll appreciate a card even if she doesn't reply.

Then, if she *does* reply (and I expect ""she"" will, even if it actually comes from an aide, but I've got no evidence to back this up) it will be a really amazing surprise for your daughter.

(I have a daughter of a similar age, and I know she'd be happy with this reply, except that she hasn't got the politics bug yet.)"
K11 W11 surely?
"Burglarised. 

Seriously, it's not a word. And sounds firking awful."
"Yes, but they're pretty closely supervised by medical professionals."
"I've done time in Saughton (HMP Edinburgh - but no one calls it that and even court warrants refer to it as Saughton) on remand, in the seg and in the Jungle there.

Drugs are easy as hell to get. The Jungle at Saughton usually reeks to high heaven of good quality green and I knew a few guys on remand for serious charges such as murder and armed robbery who were smoking smack daily for example.

American shows and the stories I've seen on reddit bear no relation to my experience of the Scottish prison system."
"Basically, repeat back what's said to you.

""Hi!"" ""Hi!""

""Alright?"" ""Alright!""

""Morning"" ""Morning"""
"There is NONE.

Factories and stuff have to follow strict anti-pollution regulations.

Old people who used to live in ex-mining areas tell me it was bad long ago- but 1960s and before...."
"Two warnings and you still didn't learn your lesson/approach them for support? Yeah, you'll get canned.

"It means they want you to be the first to say a number, so they don't accidentally pay you a penny more than then have to."
I was with you all the way up until the squat 'n' blast.
