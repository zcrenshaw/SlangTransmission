Being the target of ignorant hatred.
I'm from the UK and I hate us right now :-( 
"Honestly we don't know because nobody thought we'd be this fucking stupid.

Sorry, and I am really really sorry"
"TalkTalk, who still have no idea how all those customers details walked out of the door."
"When I was growing up, Poles with university degrees picked carrots in the fields around me, rain or shine, form 4.30 am until 5. Can't wait to do that."
Bow before president Johnson. Long may his floppy hair bamboozle people. 
"He's one of the self-appointed privileged elite. When he was a journalist he was sacked for making up quotes and was [caught on tape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDJWkS2A9T0) giving details of a fellow journalist to a friend so the friend could have the other journalist beaten up.  

He's a self-serving, promoted beyond his talent, shifty, untrustworthy embarrassment to the nation who lent his inexplicable popularity to a cause he'd never shown any interest or belief in before because he saw it might be a way to damage his old enemy Cameron and get him a shot at the job he craves and fuck all the consequences for anyone else, including the entire nation."
Just half an hour a day? Lazy bloody foreigners!
"No, seems appropriate."
"They will definitely give you some kind of warning, but I'm just failing to see how you made so many poor decisions consecutively. "
All of us who are eligible apply for our Irish passports.
"TalkTalk, who couldn't understand why I couldn't get my recently-deceased mother to come to the phone."
"I live in the most Little England place imaginable. And even here, full of rich old people with enormous Leave signs up all over the shop, people seem subdued.

School run Friday was an experience. Lots of quiet talking with drawn faces from the other parents, heard Cameron mentioned a few times as I went past but tbh I was in no place to really take it all in.

Lots of people under 30 are furious, and you can tell everyone's on eggshells around each other. I personally find myself side-eyeing people I walk past, thinking ""did YOU vote to fuck my life up when it was shit enough already?"", and I hate it but I don't know how to let go of the rage =("
"I reckon there's a solid chance we retain freedom of movement through joining the EEA or something, so I think they'd end up campaigning on eliminating that. "
David Cameron could do 1 genuinely great thing in his life and keep UK in EU.
"Options include:

- Strap in and ride the wave of recession.
- Bide your time for a couple of years, then arise to point and laugh as people realise the Leave campaigners can't follow through on their promises.
- Buy gold.
- Go somewhere else.
- Do nothing.
- adopt a hobo lifestyle"
"I just moved to an EU member state, at the start of my career in an industry with very few jobs in the UK. If I'm kicked back to the UK from the fallout of Brexit (if it happens) I think I'll find it very hard to forgive Leave voters... Like my parents. Sigh."
TalkTalk... Total shower of cunts.
"Yep, seconded on all counts. We've fucked ourselves over just to prove that we can. We deserve all the vitriol that's coming our way. "
Perhaps if it gained over 17 million votes.
"I'm a woman. Sexual harassment is a thing. Two recent incidents stand out in particular: 
1) Walking through town at 8am and having 3 drunk guys a foot taller than me blocking my path, stopping me moving on my way, making highly inappropriate comments about my body, stood maybe 30cm from me. I felt unsafe. 

2) A man three times my age on the train sitting next to me making inappropriate comments to me about how I look, if I'm dating, who I should be dating, suggestions about he and I.

That sort of stuff doesn't happen that often for me, though there has been work based sexual harassment in the past. Comments when I go running etc."

"I wish he wouldn't perpetuate outdated stereotypes of his home-country. Also, I wish he wouldn't shout as a replacement for having a punch-line."
Touch everyone.
"No idea why you're being downvoted, I think we'll probably end up following all the same rules as we are now, but with no power to influence them."
"Well I've got to pay the campsite fees for France today, which now costs a fucking fortune. 

But really, the face on Farage. Its a nightmare. These fuckers won. Its sickening. "
They really need to change their logo - it looks like something a cheap supermarket would use.
"Nigel Farages wife.

(Not really)"
"Elections are always on Thursdays.

Apparently this is why, according to wikipedia:

Election Day in the United Kingdom is by tradition a Thursday. It has been suggested that this tradition arose as the best of several circumstances: Friday pay-packets would lead to more drunken voters on Fridays and weekends; having the election as far after a Sunday as possible would reduce the influence of Sunday sermons; many towns held markets on Thursdays, thus the local population would be travelling to town that day anyway. "
"&gt;Someone on r/worldnews is trying to sort through the facts 

Poor guy"
"* Craft beer  
  
  
You mean ""real ale"", that stuff we've been drinking since time immemorial but that you've only discovered in the last couple of years and decided to call something different?"
I work at a company that exports. Our yearly turnover targets just got a lot easier to meet :)
"People will be broke but at least there will be no immigrants coming to steal all the lost jobs.

I'm worried more about workers rights. Since Cameron has been in power we've seen a massive Attack on them and I felt only Brussels was stopping us going full US "
"Looking out the window at my neighbours, wondering who voted and how. Start to think I'm genuinely aggrieved at the ones who voted leave.  Could it get antagonistic? Could there be violence? My other half is right now googling about other countries and where we could move. She's the last person I would ever think would want to live somewhere else. Or leave her parents behind , and they voted leave. She actually cried a little when she found out this morning. I actually feel sick. I'm in a country where Nigel Farage just had a significant win. The thought that my country feels like this makes me feel it's not my country. I've never felt particularly patriotic, its just the place I was born in, its irrational to think that makes it special, but I've always defended it from those who sought to knock us, but not now. I'm embarrassed. "
"&gt; If a country like Peru can negotiate freedom of movement within the EU countries for its citizens

A visa waiver is not freedom of movement. "
Or wait for Scotland to get a second indy ref and then get a Scottish passport! 
"I doubt they were.  If the guy was willing to work, he'd have taken the offered lift.  She would simply have rang back a few minutes later and said can't get the lift, come back in on your next shift.

Now she's established that he was not willing to work, whether that is true or not."
"That 30% can go and fucking drown themselves in a ditch, as far as I'm concerned. Anyone who didn't vote has no right to say anything at this point. They can keep their opinions to themselves, just like they kept their vote to themselves."

My boyfriend bought me a big bag of Cadbury Giant Buttons. For some adorable and naive reason it is resealable.
Don't get hard but if you do hang your towel from it like a peg.
"I feel sick.

Everyones careers/life depend on this.

The whole thing is a farce."
"not really.

We asked to be invited to the party, and when we were we then we tried to burn the  house down."
It means parliament can ignore the result of the referendum if they wish. To do so would be going against the will of the people and would not be politically wise
Don't throw around words like tyranny lightly? What tyrannical laws were put forth by the EU that the UK government was forced to accept
"If it helps I made a [word cloud](http://i.imgur.com/QcobyBd.png) of this thread.
"
Well we're already being fucked by him.
I can't work and I'm reliant on the Governments good will as to whether or not they feel I'm ill enough to need help. The thought of leaving Europe makes me feel even less stable. I also suspect if leave wins it might spark some nasty hate crimes against foreigners.
No touching.
"Parliament still has to make the final decision. The referendum is not legally bound, however parliament is equally split as per the votes. 
"
"Ah yes, getting rid of our MPs and being able to choose between Trump or Clinton. How wonderful. /s"
"We do have armed police, they're just not all armed with a gun. Some carry tasers or batons. They are trained in how to tackle and restrain people in dangerous situations."
"if we only fucked our selves it would be ok, but we damaged the whole EU with this. I also feel this is deserved."
"I'm Indian. I've lived here for the better part of a decade, for a while north of London, for a long time in the south-west and now on the south coast. I've always lived in small villages or tiny towns. 

I've yet to experience any racism. Not one incident so far. I've endured a few jokes about Indians / brown skin people from good friends because I know they're actually great people and have had my back, and because I can talk shit about them to their face too. 

Random people in the street have been nice, strangers on the bus and train, staff at supermarket checkout counters, garage owners, cafe owners, landlords... no problems. The few nasty people I've met were universally nasty, equal-opportunity misanthropes.

Not saying there aren't racists in the country, just that I haven't experienced any."

"&gt; What would you suggest be my next step in finding out if I still have a job?

Get your self into the office and apologise profusely."
"I think it's because the timescale of the campaign means that it will be over before any legal challenges can get investigated. (E.g. Nissan wanting to sue the Leave campaign.)

I feel it's disappointing that both sides have, to put it at its most neutral, grossly exaggerated things, and really avoided saying the tough things about what might happen in the event of both Leave and Remain.

Fortunately, the public seems to have realised everyone is lying or at least distorting the truth. But it's a big big waste of time and resources when the actual issue of in or out is a pretty critical one for all our futures, IMHO.

"
"TalkTalk, my internet and phone have been offline for me at least one night a week of the last three weeks. I get regular interruptions where parts of the internet aren't available. I would not be with them but I let my wife sort out our internet connection.  The previous time I was with them they lied to me on the phone, took three times as much out of my account as they were supposed to and only stopped when I played them a recording of the conversation(at which point they did refund me the money they owed me plus a couple of hundred for my inconvenience).

That's aside form their terrible customer service and lackadaisical approach to security.


They also ship routers susceptible to attack."
"'The best argument against democracy is a 5 minute conversation with the average voter.'

'Think of how stupid the average person is, and then realize that half of them are stupider than that.'  
\- George Carlin"
Ooh just thought of one. All the farmers with Leave signs up will lose their Common Agricultural Policy funds.
"Let's start by pointing out that this wasn't voting. It was a public opinion poll. It's not a final decision, it's more of a guide for the parliament, before they start discussing the implications and whether they should invoke Article 50 or not.

It's entirely possible that the parliament will decide to stay in the EU, seeing how everything's going to shit after this poll, and how pissed all the future workers are. "
* Die of dysentery
"absolutely. My entire job sector massively depends on big businesses right now, and of the 20+ different huge international organisations I've worked with over the past year, they are almost all planning massive relocations in the event of an exit vote. They've spent *decades* aligning their businesses to fit with EU law , and it's cheaper and easier to relocate than to stay and start over. They might still do business with the UK, but most of it will be done from an EU country.

on top of that, of those that do stay, they'll be reducing their budgets for external consultants as their cost of doing business suddenly doubles (suddenly you need licenses from a ton more government organisations, legal contracts need redrawing and so on), as will their clients and partner companies. 

I can see what has been triple digit company growth every year turning into redundancies over the next few years as this kicks in. There's a raft of other potential problems as well (We do a lot of international travel which will be more expensive and a lot with visas which will be more complex), but that's the main concern.

I hope very much that i'm wrong, but I've not seen anything to indicate that I am. "
