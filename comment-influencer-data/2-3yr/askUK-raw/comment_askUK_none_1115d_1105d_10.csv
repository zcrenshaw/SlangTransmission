"Yeah, my brother just gave me a couple in exchange for a tenner.  Frankly not that impressed.  Feels like cling film on one side with a really low grade picture of the Queen, looking more like a wonky photocopy of Shrek.  The other side looks just like a Monopoly £10 note onto which they've added a hand drawing of someone called ""Famous Dude"".  The whole thing looks like it has been edged with sellotape which is still sticky.... oh hang on.  Bastard!"
"Very seriously. We will take you seriously, support you 100% of the way and try our best to do as you wish. Please have a look at [NCDV](http://www.ncdv.org.uk/) it's the National Centre for Domestic Violence, they can offer civil support and counselling referrals, I can't rate them enough."
"John Lewis/Waitose. Worked for Waitrose, loved how they ran the company, they have good polices about returns etc, the quality is great.

John Lewis - the quality is great, you can return it if you aren't happy with it. 2 year free warranty and price match make it the only place I'll buy my electronics from. "

"Customer service wise Amazon. Stuff doesn't usually go wrong, but when it does I don't dread contacting their customer service department. 

John Lewis because of their price match and warranties.

Premier Inn. Every one I've stayed in has been clean and comfortable and well-priced. Recently stayed in one that didn't have air conditioning and the room temperature didn't dip below 27. I complained and they issued a full refund with no quibbles.
If you don't like picking up the phone perhaps you should be my GP's receptionist.

"A chip butty. I'm in Cambodia and I met these two New Zealanders, and they both ordered chip buttys and say to me and the waiter that it's kinda just a New Zealand thing. I'm like 'hold on a second! After fish and chips or bangers and mash that's like one of the most British things out there!' This is in my opinion of course
TL;DR I didn't know anyone liked chip buttys outside the UK"
"I call myself British, although I'm from England. In my opinion, English people who make a point of self-identifying as English, bemoaning St George's Day isn't a bank holiday and calling for an English national anthem at sporting events are usually saddo facebook wankers. "

"Discreetly - probably. Legally, not allowed to.

It does happen, an employer will look at your name and think ""can't even pronounce the name"" and that puts them off the rest of the CV.

Unless you have something that really stands out, it may be a detriment.

Sorry!"

"Ebuyer. 

Sent me a motherboard with bent pins on it, and kept refusing the RMA because of the bent pins. 

That's the problem, you sent me a dud motherboard! "
"Any American attempting a ""british"" accent always sounds awful. "
"A few years ago I had Virgin broadband. I won't recount the full soap opera of how they behaved when i had a problem, the phonecalls I had to make every day, the ridiculous non-solutions they suggested, the rudeness of the call staff (I had a 20 minute row with one who refused to pass my call on to someone more senior after he admitted he didn't have a clue what to do).

So I terminated my contract. They, however, kept taking money from my account. More soap opera. For months. It only got resolved because I took the 'contact the managing director' route, and the PA of someone high up (can't remember the actual title now, MD, CEO, something like that), personally saw to it.

Never again. If Virgin became the only company supplying broadband/fibre /wifi whatever, I'd learn to live without it."
"Shelter and Refuge may be options for you, they will at least be able to offer proper advice on what to do next. Best of luck."
"John Lewis are great if you work in the store, because then you become a partner and get all the great perks and bonuses. Their online side of the company, which when I was there made more money than all the physical stores combined, is outsourced to a third party. All the parters voted to see if those in the contact centre dealing with irate customers via phone and email all day, should become partners and they voted against it. I worked 42.5hrs a week and got £12,995 per annum  before tax (in 2010) and got a cheap bottle of wine as a Christmas ""bonus"" when the partners all got £2000. Then I have to sit on the phone and deal with a customer who was unhappy about something but thinks I'm getting a 2 grand bonus cause they don't know we weren't partners. Fuck John Lewis. "
without underwear. get some nice air circulating in there and let your bits breath.
"There's a local carpet fitting service to us and, one day, I was driving into a carpark for a supermarket when one of their vans had stopped in the middle of the road. The lane they were in was to turn in front of us so I stopped and waited for them to turn in. But they didn't, they just sat there. So, after about 5 or so seconds I said ""Oh, for fuck's sake!"" under my breath and kept on driving, found a parking spot and got out.

Next thing I knew the driver of the van sped right up next to me, squealed his brakes and shouted, very loudly from his window, ""Did you just call me a fucking twat?"". This was in a very public area and a mother and child were apparently also closeby in earshot. Their van also also very clearly emblazened with all of their company details, name and website.

""I didn't call you anything!"" I shot back, and just ignored him as I went into the supermarket to pick up what I needed. Later, when we were leaving, we drove past where the van had originally wanted to turn into and they were there. As soon as we drove past they revved their van up and started driving and, honest to God, I felt like they were planning to follow us. I drove out and immediately took a different route, winding through many roads and turns and then eventually decided to get back on the main road and home.
Fucking twats..."
"Countdown.

They could have jazzed that shit up, with big electronic boards, decimal numbers, and punctuation. But fuck all that, let's keep it exactly the same forever."
I think the whole Brit food shit food thing came from all the yanks being over here during the war while the food was most certainly a bit below the current standard
"British. I'm from England (Yorkshire), but I don't like to place a divider between myself and other parts of Britain, I'd prefer we be together. "
"The divide is between London and the rest of the UK.

London is very different from any other city in the UK."
"Yep. Thought all schools did, to be honest."
"&gt; What sort of trouble might I be in? Can I expect repercussions? 

Technically none; you're allowed to look for other jobs.

However, if your company and it's staff are spiteful, they might spread the word and make it difficult for you in the current company."

"Cost, autos are almost always at least a couple of grand more. On really cheap cars having auto can add like 20% onto the price. Traditionally most cars sold here are small and auto gearboxes were traditionally heavy so it makes less sense.

Americans spend on average many more hours in their bigger cars so autos caught on and became a standard feature, similar to how cruise control is way more common over there."
"Shit food.  

Some how we are renowned globally for dull and shit food.

It is not unique to us at all most of the world offers terrible food much if the time, we have not cornered the market on unadventurous or bland, nor do we have it cornered on just generally bad food."

"Went to see Lost Prophets at Leeds Cockpit &amp; a pre-convicted for sexual assault Ian Watkins was 'round the back afterwards. I was young, drunk &amp; not a fan so I casually asked him to sign my cock. He refused.

In hindsight I was probably too old for him."
"Your last shot?! Do you plan to live only until you're 30! If you already have a degree I believe it's only 1 year to qualify as a teacher, by then you'll be 25 and still having to work for at least 40 years, it's definitely worth trying for something else to make you happy. It'd still be worth it at 50, for those next 15 years in a job."
"My mum met the Queen twice, in the 50s and in the 80s. The second time, I was astonished that she said to HM, 'Do you remember meeting me last time?'

My mum was also a Buddhist. When the Dalai Lama was around, she used to go and meet him and take a scented geranium for him to bless. She'd then give cuttings to her friends.

Bumped into Nicola Adams at the vet last year; her Pomeranian puppy was getting its first vaccinations. She was a very modest, gentle person. Impossible to believe she could easily knock one's block off. Seeing the family in interviews now, the dog is not as nice-looking as it was as a puppy.

Did live in West London for many years, so did see people off TV and film walking around all the time. I suppose was most star-struck by sitting at the next table from Richard Attenborough in the restaurant, and funniest was when was eating a perfectly OK but not special Chinese meal, and Heston Blumenthal came in, ordered and carried out a take-away.

A certain number of people I knew at college are now famous. And in each case, exactly like they used to be. I taught Stewart Lee, who was a bit of a wag even then. Boris, who I used to sit next to in the common room, is exactly as much a loud buffoon as he ever was.

Anyone into WW2, Leonard Cheshire gave me some school prizes once on Speech Day. I hoped he'd talk about the war, but no, of course it was about the Cheshire Homes.

C S Lewis - I mean in person- converted my sister (who is a generation older than I am) to Christianity. He gave her some Narnia books. As a small child I could not understand why they were kept separate under glass and I had to read paperback copies."
"Halifax banking lost my business when I was upset and withdrawing the last of my meagre savings because I was awaiting a benefits investigation that had suspended all payments for up to 12 weeks. The sneering woman was not interested in helping me and openly scoffed at the amount I wanted when I said I needed all of it. So I closed the account and left with tears because I was embarrassed, stressed and just wanted to get it done discreetly. "
"Or the tourists who go to central London, see the first pub with a ""best fish and chips in London"" sign outside and end up getting served an Iceland special.

It would be like me visiting New York and only eating in the cheapest chain restaurants and then complaining that you can only get garbage fast food in the city."

Points of View. People write in and complain because Downton Abbey used a model of train that was released in June 1923 when the episode was very clearly set in May 1923. What's more British than pedantry?
Equally British *and* Scottish. Scottish people who insist they aren't British confuse me.
"Hi BillySears,

Yes one bathroom is pretty typical. Lots of us have a downstairs loo. Some posher or newer houses have en-suites on the master bedroom, so that would count as two bathrooms. 

If your really posh you would have multiple guest bathrooms.

We call clothes dryers ""tumble dryers"". They are pretty common. You would find one in the utility room, or in the garage. some people have them in spare bedrooms that are kinda converted into laundry rooms. 

So in short, one bathroom is pretty normal. Downstairs loo is a bonus. Posh or newer have en-suite. 

Id say that a family of four can cope with one bathroom no problem. Having seen american homes on telly, you are very likely going to have a much smaller home &amp; garden than you are used to."
"Can't help you as a local (I live hundreds of miles from there) but I have to ask ... why?!

According to [its Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warbstow) it seems to be a wholly unremarkable small village, pretty much identical to thousands of similar places all over the UK, and looking at it on Google street view it also seems to have nothing notable about it at all.

So I'd love to know, just to satisfy my own curiosity -- what on earth has Warbstow got to fascinate someone on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean?"
"I don't know how to feel about this, as I worked for Jessops before administration (got out way before they went bust!).

While it's obviously a crap situation for you, there was no conspiracy, Peter Jones just stepped in and bought the brand and re-opened a number of the shops, only a couple at first, then expanded. He basically just reused the brand as it had some customer good will, he saved and brought back a lot of jobs, etc, but obviously some customers got fucked by it. A hell of a lot more staff did, mind. There's people out there who are going to get 2p on the pound for vast amounts of owed redundancy/holiday.

I suppose the horrible lesson is to never use gift cards."
"Official routes like Shelter, Refuge and Women's Aid can help you for free but if you have good friends in your course someone might need a roommate or be willing to loan you a sofa until you can afford to go into a proper house share. If you can get financial help from family there's no shame in asking for their help either. You can also report the abuse to the police and ask for protection against retaliation in the form of a restraining order.Your uni support service will absolutely provide you with guidance and the SU can help too. Maybe the financial help is just for home students but there will be resources to help any student that is suffering. 
I hope your situation improves soon."
"We will respond to 999 calls within 15 minutes or earlier, if possible. We don't have to witness violence to take action, you could ring 101 now and book an appointment to see an officer to make a complaint of assault."
"There's been a few articles that've semi seriously floated the idea that the Japanese are culturally very similar to us (industrious islanders, still a monarchy, shaking off old very rigid class distinctions slowly etc)."

incompetence.

You'll get over that amazement pretty quickly."
