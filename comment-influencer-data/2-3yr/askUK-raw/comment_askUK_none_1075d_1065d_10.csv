"This is a well known con in Edinburgh, they take the 50p as a loss but what you don't know is they've marked you, within a week or so you'll be snatched off the street and taken to a secret location whereby you'll be intravenously fed greggs pies until you burst. Only a transfer of £100000 in Bitcoin can stop it.

RIP."
"Southerner here. Don't know what your friends are on, it's ""can't be arsed"". "
"No, nothing. One of the competencies tested is turning up in a car which is fit for driving. Vehicle failure = automatic failure of the test.  

However since your contract with the instructor includes him providing a car, it should be his responsibility to pay for the next test."
"If you are not overtaking you should be in the left most lane. 


If you are just sat in the middle lane, you are lane hogging which is an offence and you can be pulled over for it.

 
If there is nothing in the left hand lane, or there is a significant gap between you and the vehicle in front, then you should be in the left hand lane.

I drive on the motorways on a daily basis. I'm not saying I'm the perfect drive but I can't stand people who sit in the middle lane at 70. The amount of times I've had to move from the left lane to the right lane to avoid undertaking someone is far too often. The other day there was someone sat in the middle lane at 60mph, besides being very annoying its also dangerous.  "

"""I'm a Brit that moved to America when I was a kid"" "
"First go to /r/london and read the wiki, its in huge letters at the op of the sub and in the sidebar.

I'm concerned you don't have accommodation booked or even a shortlist. London gets busy. The wiki has recommendations. Good budget hotels are travelodge, tune, IBIS, premier inn to name a few.

It irks me when people don't want to see the touristy things. You *are* a tourist. It would be foolish to not walk past Buckingham Palace*, Big Ben and Parliament. It's potentially a once in a lifetime holiday, and they are iconic around the world.

*You said Buckingham, which is a town around 60 miles outside of London. Dont truncate place names, we don't do that here. if you ask for directions to 'Liverpool' You will be sent on an intercity train for a couple of hours far away from 'Liverpool Street' which is in London. A lot of Americans have trouble with this."
"There's the famous (possibly apocryphal) story of the American lady who stopped a local close to Marble Arch to ask for directions ""to Oxford"". Being a helpful bloke, and knowing that the express bus to Oxford picked up passengers from a nearby stop, he helped her on to the coach and waved her off. It was only 90 minutes later as they pulled off the M40 into the city of dreaming spires and she asked the driver ""is Selfridges near here"" that she found out she should really have been asking for ""Oxford Street""."
"Will be going for a nice meal followed by drinks. Will hopefully end up shagging the company secretary*

*Am married to company secretary "
The price for the meal deal is three pounds. He made a mistake. It's an extra 50p if you get the sandwich not the other way round. If you bought the sandwich first then the drink afterwards then you could've given the 50p. He should've asked you for 1.80.  
"Because there's a metric fuckton of rubbish CS grads out there.
 
Tons of people study computer science in hopes of securing a high paying career but few are willing to put in the additional effort - internships, side-projects, etc. "
"In an old job, I used to go down 2 floors to the Sky toilets, because they were far nicer and it meant Rupert Murdoch had to pay to take my poo away."
"Just like my old man used to say; ""Always make sure you're up to date with your poultry legislation."" "
I just use my phones built in speaker. 
I'd probably put a pair of trousers on too.

Antibiotic use in livestock to promote growth has been illegal in the EU for a decade.
"1. Temporary friends will be easy to find. 
2. If possible remember to bring pineapple &amp; pineapple based treats! Pineapples are incredibly rare in the UK, and virtually unknown in places. If you have a pineapple, you'll have no trouble getting people to approach you and ask about the interesting and humorous fruit.
3. I would book a decent hotel personally. You're here to have a good time, surely? Not be in some grotty hostel.
4. If you want country views, try the lake district or peak district. "

Demand they pay for it! It's pretty unacceptable that they sent you out to do a test in a car in that state. 
"That letter is just scaremongering, and realistically they can't do anything if you don't let them. That said, if your flatmates watch live TV/iPlayer then you should pay for your TV license. If not, then don't worry about anything."

"British people do all of these things.

Some notes:

You don't legally need a car seat if you're travelling in a taxi. You do if it's a private car. It's the driver's responsibility, not the parents.

It's much easier to travel on London buses instead of the tube with a buggy. Most tube stations are not very accessible. The TFL website (and presumably they have an app) is extremely helpful, use it.

Nobody cares if you drink alcohol around children unless you're getting horribly drunk.

Nobody uses breastfeeding covers. You'll probably get more looks if you use one. It's considered normal to breastfeed up to about a year, then people occasionally seem surprised about it, but really nothing serious. It's less common in NI than it is in London, but for a 6 month old, nobody will bat an eye. You can breastfeed wherever you want unless the baby is not allowed to be there.

In case people use terminology you don't initially understand:

A stroller is called a buggy, pushchair or pram.

A crib is called a cot. British English crib is a smaller version which will be too small for a 6 month old. A pack n play is a travel cot or a playpen, depending on whether you're using it for sleeping or containment.

A onesie is a vest. The one with sleeves and feet is a babygrow. Maybe a sleepsuit.

A pacifier is a dummy. The soft flexible top part of a bottle is called a teat. If you call it a nipple people will think you mean your breast.

Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is paracetamol, the most popular children's brand is calpol and can be bought at any supermarket, Boots, or Superdrug. The baby one comes with a little syringe. I expect you'd bring your own, but just in case! If you need urgent medical care for the baby when you're over there, just take them to an ordinary emergency department (A&amp;E) or GP surgery, there's no separate paediatric facility (sometimes there's one in-house). Pharmacists can give medical advice if your problem is minor.

Have a great trip!"
"You have the legal right to breastfeed anywhere you and baby are allowed to be, no need to cover and generally people will just leave you to get on with it. Some pubs don't allow children, some only allow them before around 7pm, some only allow them if you're eating. If using a stroller on the tube, it's worth looking out for which stations have lifts."
"Tell people you are American then. If it quacks like a duck, who gives a fuck?"
"Luckily we don't really bother what people with babies do.

Remember all the puritans left here to setup 'Murica"
The prices are just a gateway into the sausage rolls - which are almost certainly laced with crack.

You've got as good a chance as anyone then.

"Electrons move in a wire, it's kind of weird actually, imagine a big chain of marbles in a tube, each marble is an electron, at one end you have a negative charge which is like a vacuum sucking the marbles and at the other end is a positive charge which is like a blower, pushing the marbles."

I'd be alright with that."
OP basically just robbed a Greggs.
Just go to Primark and get a cheap one. It's not *that* cold in London. 
Lol... You really think the HMRC would use a hotmail address and even then a hotmail address with nothing related to the HMRC in it?

you'll have to delcare it at customs though or they might hit you with a hefty exotic fruit fine if discovered undeclared.
