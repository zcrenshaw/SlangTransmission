"Yes, he absolutely does. Landlord and Tenant Act. This is dodgy as fuck. "
I don't like Oreos.  Not a scratch on a Bourbon.
"&gt; I was struck by how ""American"" her accent sounded

No she doesn't you wazzock."
Oohh I hope some queueing is involved!
"Change your wifi network name to ""Number xx are bin stealing scum"""
fucking bollocks do you shit down the drain of your bath
"Football violence.

A fella who says get out of my pub in cockney tone.

Stab a roadman with a dull tesco value kitchen knife."
"The fact that you pay him in cash and don't have a toilet makes me think this is something that will be featured on some TV show.

This is dodgy as hell

What do you do for a kitchen? What does your contract say?"
"At least she was honest. There will be people secretly hating presents and then resenting the gift giver, although that is quite a terrible way to behave."
"TGI Fridays. Just nasty. I've been with friends there and not ordered food myself just because I know it's terrible, but tried bites of theirs and it was as expected. Dry, greasy chicken fingers with a greasy flavourless dip, and grey rubbery burgers. I'd say the food is better in Wetherspoons."
"To be honest, if you can't even talk to women I would work on getting female friends before you worry about dating."
Find somewhere better to live then report him to your local authority
After meeting your cousin for drinks you have to try and stay awake on the tube by repeatedly pressing x.
"&gt; I just piss , brush and shit in the tub (and force it down with water, so its clean), as i'm too lazy to walk 2 mins. 

wat"
"Just say ""No, they don't do that at the charity shop."" "
Flat roofs are a no no.
The comparison site one with the builders/guys in hot pants dance off. Makes my teeth itch.
"Next time after it has been emptied get in the bin and hide, then when the thief comes and tries to take it jump out and scare the shit out of them.

Or tape a passive aggressive note to it, informing them you know who they are and what they are doing. If they're a lot bigger and scarier than you and look like they may beat you up then don't do this though."
"I would say Frankie and Bennys but that abomination of a restaurant isn't even an import, it's just shit. "
"A really good place to start would be have a chat with Shelter as they'll be able to give you some good advice on what to do next:

"Probably my new shed. I actually did the unthinkable and treated it with three coats of Cuprinol *before* assembling it - the first documented case of this in human history. 

Reinforced the roof with 2x4 as well to avoid the same collapse the previous one had suffered. Also built my own base for it to stop the floor going through.

"Ah, Oreos, the biscuit import absolutely nobody wanted or asked for."

I really hope this whole thread is a 'prank' but I have heard some real renting horror stories before. GTF out of there.
"Krispy Kreme donuts. I'm just not a fan.

My local 5 guys are expensive but alright quality and they give loads of toppings. That being said Burger King and Mcdonalds are both USA chains too and I think 5 guys is way better quality meat. I think most of our big takeaway chains are american imports - KFC, Dominos, Pizza Hut etc.

Oh.. how about Starbucks? Pretty over-rated imo. Easily accessible and good wifi so often good places to meet up but to me the drinks are meh and the prices are ugh."
"You have to drop the kids at school and then get to work on time, using the M25 at rush hour. It's tough, but doable occasionally."
Yes. Crazy idea but different people like different things
Our presumptive Head of State doesn't get into pointless arguments on twitter.
Attend a flat viewing with 40 other people 
"Although I wouldn't personally care, I  imagine people constantly using your driveway as a turning point would get annoying, with the noise, lights, possible damage to your driveway etc.

It's the people who put ""no parking"" signs outside of their property who are more annoying. They don't own the road and can't stop people parking outside just because it's where they like to park (except if it causes an obstruction, of course). An old neighbour of mine wrote ""no parking"" in white paint on his wall. It looked a mess and just caused more people to park there."
"Not being funny like, but how the fuck does your shit fit down the plughole?"
"A lot of them can be very local and not welcoming to tourists or outsiders but then there are a lot that are very welcoming.  
If you're planning on visiting a pub try looking up what people say on Google or social media to get an idea."
"You say DAWNCE, I say DONCE! (plinky plonky plinky plonky) You say FRAWNCE, I say FRAAÀNCE! 

Nope. I say Dance and France. "
They're terrible sun lounger stealing criminals. 
"Everyone has an accent.

Her's is a specific upper class accent that has become more RP in recent years. The American transatlantic accent is based on RP so maybe that's why you feel like that. Have you listened to any other members of the Royal Family speak?"
You shit in the bath for God's sake.  You need a kennel not a flat.
The Haribo adverts with the adults talking in children's voices. I physically can't be in the room while that advert is on. 
Starbucks. They purposely burn the coffee beans and every time I get a coffee in there it just tastes like crap. There are so many much better smaller cafes I'd rather get a coffee from.
Waffle stomp.
Any advert by bastarding Oak Furniture Land.
"I've seen people get wheelie bins vinyl-wrapped with pictures of leaves or whatever to disguise them - I say you get it wrapped with a massive picture of your face on all four sides, and maybe the top for good measure. "

"Yeah, sounds like a massively dodgy unlicensed HMO set-up."
You should be more careful

"When I was... Oooh... 8 or 9 I entered a ""count the number of spots on the giraffe"" competition one summer holiday. Apparently I was the *only* child who noticed that there was a spot on the tail, so I won a box of FIFTY Cadbury's Curly Wurlys. 

Nothing I've ever won since has lived up to that childish feeling of glee I got from seeing a HUGE box of chocolate which was MINE! ALL MINE! 

My intention was to live like a king and eat nothing but chocolate for the foreseeable future. 

Of course, that didn't last long. My mum made me share them with my little brother (did *he* count the spots? No. But that argument fell on deaf ears.).

I also had to give some to my school friends (something about socialism meaning we had to share our good fortune with others).

My dad ate some (for quality control purposes, he lied).

In the end, I think I was left with around ten. Less than a dozen measly chocolate bars. I'd started with millions and now only had a handful. 

After eating the third one in a row I felt sick, and my stash remained uneaten throughout the summer. 

There's a lesson in there somewhere… "
Parents in law gave us a gift certificate via email for a US only store despite them knowing we've lived in the UK for the last 10 years.
"The advert for Sauvage perfume with Johnny depp.    
  
I gotta get out of here.  
Which way?  
I don't know.  
What am i looking for?  
Something I can't see.  
It's magic."
