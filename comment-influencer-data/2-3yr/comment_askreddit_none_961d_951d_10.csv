"This is my reason for saying no to a second date 9/10 times. On the first date, I found out that they didn't do anything interesting or unique with their spare time. "

"Not Mexicans, surely? Wasn't he referring to Mexicans who had illegally hopped the border?

&gt; Second he's denying RE-entry to the country to people who have already been through all the legal checks required and have a visa to prove it.

That isn't racism. Stop calling anti-Islam sentiment racism. Islam is a religion. Someone's race does not tell you what they believe, what their ideology is, or anything about them beyond what they look like. Disliking a race is wrong for this reason. It is not wrong to dislike a religion. I dislike  all of them myself.

So... nazi.
"Depending on your age, it's harder than you think. If you are below the age of 25, your body makes it real easy to be healthy. Eventually you have to exercise constantly to stay healthy."
It's not obvious.  This *was* a teenage driver recounting this incident.  Teens are not renowned for their awareness and consideration of others.  
"Jesus fucking, fuck....

People like this are fucking horse shit.  Although, if it was one of those things where you both were drunk and he thinks you had sex with him for fun and claimed rape later on, or even just couldn't deal with it is to break up with you for irreconcilable differences."
"If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny how wrong you are."

"yes because its never the special snowflake's fault when the sun shines on it

If I stopped or toned down whenever some douche told me -- never mind a fuckin elementary school music teacher (clearly the pinnacle of creative achievement)-- my life would be more about blaming them than being me.

you wouldn't expect to get paid at whatever dipshit hobby you happen into, downhill tire sledding, so recognize music for the talent filter it has.

and give me the tempo

"I disagree. They are either feminine men (which is fine of course), or have an identity disorder (which is probably fine too, but should be recognized as such.)"
Could be the US
No it isn't. Why can't America lock its doors and decide who gets in and who doesn't? Every American does that with their houses. 
"I know! I hate being able to talk to people at any convenient time, while also having the freedom to choose not to. "
Not Making America Great Again. But he will.
"Yeah, things are complicated, but if you refuse to tell anyone, you're a selfish piece of garbage. Grow a backbone and stop letting this shit happen. If you don't, you're only letting others get hurt like you did. I understand some people have terrible negligent parents, but go to authorities."
hello
"Not always, but it is sometimes. It can't hurt you to try and work out what you're not happy about and do something about it. Now, finding the power to do stuff about it is hard. But being able to focus on something and do something actively towards a goal makes things better for a lot of people. 

edit: I'm getting downvoted for this because people don't like the idea that perhaps there's work that you can do. I know that it's not that simple. There's more than that that drags you down and makes everything worthless. I've felt it. I nearly dropped out of university after going home before I could rent the room I was supposed to live in because I had a bit of a rough conversation with a prospective landlord and fucking lost it. I kind of feel it now. And yet, there's still something you can do. Even in the darkest times, getting something worthwhile done makes life a little better. And when it doesn't, it still means that you've done something positive. And often positive things will help you even if you don't feel like it will. "
"&gt; Did you miss the entirety of The Clone Wars, where he's a high ranking military officer constantly in direct contact with the Jedi Council? Or Revenge of the Sith where he was on the Council himself?

were talking about movie ONE those happened in 3, maybe YOU should rewatch them, none of Anakins training happens in the jedi order"
"He's no longer president. He is our dictator.

"Except that if you read the stories people present you find out they do something really stupid and suspicious or they break protocol. Like finding a child lost in a grocery store, you don't drag them around with you looking for their parents. You take them to the front desk or customer service; nobody will think poorly of you for doing that. Stores often have lost child protocols for a reason, and they are virtually all uniform so you have no excuse not knowing them."
"It seems like many of the stories here center around people's belief in ghosts.  Look, when a creepy incidence like some of the stories here happens with you present, do yourself a favor and Google about the scientific evidence supporting ghosts (hint: it's lacking).  Education is king.

Edit:  I get downvoted for telling people to educate themselves on a scientific matter?  Lol wow, okay.  "
It's a very overused meme but people seem to still like it for some reason.

"Nurses have up to 13 patients each. Nurses are busy people. Cancer is not something that will kill you in a day. And like you said, it's just a button. So why was it such a big deal? Between your machine and the IVs that need to be refilled and bed alarms, there's a lot of noises to deal with."

Wrong. People going temporarily insane and kill accidentally all the time.
Riiiight... The Canadian supreme court didn't declare it a violation of human rights or anything... Forcing the government to allow private healthcare so people could stop dying while waiting in line for life saving treatment they needed...
