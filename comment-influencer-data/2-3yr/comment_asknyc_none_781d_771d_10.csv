"There is so much money concentrated in Manhattan that there are many different kinds of rich in New York City.  
  
Exclusive ""old money"" lives on the Upper East Side. Think internationally-recognized politicians, old infamous oligarchical families, Illuminati master of the world types. Money is orgiastically spent here for status more than anything else. Features include Barneys and Sothebys, which sell handbags that cost more than your car and art worth more than the GDP of a small nation.  
  
The Upper West Side is the conservative UES' liberal foil, with some of the most inexplicably high rents in the city despite being a pretty 'normal' Manhattan neighborhood. These types don't like to admit they're wealthy or display it outwardly, and unlike their eastern counterparts have no problem colonizing north of 96th street to save a buck. There are a ton of restaurants that cost a lot but are low-key, and a lot of money invested in public venues like theaters, grocery stores, and schools. Columbus Circle station even has a shopping mall in it.
  
SoHo and Nolita are the cutting-edge fashion district, you will find tons of $15 salads and tiny boutique salons and clothing/jewellery stores with costs that will boggle the mind.  Be careful bringing a girlfriend here. If you see a bunch of skinny white girls in their late 20s with black dresses and wide brim black hats looking like they going to a funeral on Spring Street, you're in the right spot.  
  
Tribeca, Battery Park City, and Fidi are a bit soulless and corporate. Most of the wealth here is concentrated up in expensive high-rise condominiums and office buildings, out of your reach. There's very few businesses on the ground that reflect the kind of money they put into residential and financial real estate here, but there are a lot of fancy tourist attractions like the World Trade, Oculus, and Battery Park.

My favorite wealthy neighborhoods to recommend to visitors are the West Village and Chelsea. In addition to their status as a gay cultural mecca there's beautiful unique architecture and winding streets, and tons of places to see and spend your money from Chelsea Market to the High Line to the Whitney to the great bars and restaurants in the West Village. 

One more added bonus is checking out Williamsburg to see what happens to a neighborhood when hipsters make six figures."
You're never gonna afford a house.

This is a complete lie."

"So I normally support working things out with neighbors and dealing with shit with the offender in person and not calling the cops on people, but fuck it, call the cops on them. I'd also write letters to the co-op board, your city council member, whoever else you can raise a stink with. You might even try writing a letter to de Blasio since he's invested in routing out shitty AirBNB stuff. "
"Bostonians are convinced there's this huge rivalry between NYC and Boston and will often comment on restaurants or culture in their city and how it's easily as good as anything in NYC.

New Yorkers are vaguely aware there's a city called ""Boston"" somewhere north in the vast expanse of the US that they refer to as ""other"". Some New Yorkers might know people who have been there, daring ones may have even visited themselves."

"I think OP isn't offended by tipping, but wants to support businesses that pay their service staff a fair wage."
"Nah...back in the '90s the UWS was mainly agricultural. Columbus Avenue was used to bring cattle to market, and anything above the 80s was considered Indian Territory. Lincoln Center was called Fort Lincoln in those days, and this is where many of the films known as ""Westerns"" were filmed. That's why they were called ""Westerns"" ...because they were filmed on the west side. 

Everybody knows this, it's a well-known fact. "
"I'm nice as fuck to customer service people, cashiers, bartenders, waiters, bouncers, the staff I supervise, the neighborhood people, the regulars at the bar, my mechanic, fellow concert goers and museum attendees, the people on my block and in my building. I don't go out of my way to be nice to randoms on the train or the street, but I also don't default to major cunt unless someone does shit makes it seem like they deserve it. It's working fine for me. "
you didn't overreact and bedbugs ABSOLUTELY travel between apartments. i'm pretty sure that's how i got them when i had them once. wouldn't wish the experience on my worst enemy. 
Bring it back to the airport and visit the lost luggage counter. 
"IIRC, there were actually at least two episodes about dealing with alternate side parking. "
You're a fucking saint for having this much patience. I would strongly consider increasing the urgency of repairs by continuing to use the sink after nearly a year.
"whaaaaat.  Are you sure they didn't say ""13.5% of the annual""?  That refers to the annual rent. To get the fee amount, take the monthly rent x 12, then take 13.5% of that. 

Edit: It comes to about 1.5 month's rent. "
Parks &amp; Rec was pretty much a documentary on their depictions of community meetings.
I highly recommend getting on the subway and going to a different neighborhood.
It worked for me: cameras and motion activated flood lights. 
 If you need to ask a question like that here - I think you are under qualified for the job. 
You need a sublet where you rent through the tenant/leaseholder.
"I know someone whom I can't and won't introduce, sorry. Partially because I will say you need to approach it with more nuance than immediately framing them as 'defectors' before even meeting them. That term carries a lot of shame and politicized rhetoric that assigns a ton of value judgments, by which you're stripping your subject of their own agency and beliefs.  
  
You can try Asian-American groups, but show a lot more deference if one puts you in touch. Shut up and listen to your subject without asking loaded questions and narrating who they are. They would be doing you a massive favor, North Koreans do not like to talk to Western reporters about their experiences and nobody wants to be used as a political pawn."
You're in LitinatownCa. 
Going to the Cloisters.  I didn't move away but it took me 29 years of my existence to finally listen to everyone who said you have to go.  It's beautiful up there. Go see it and then walk around Ft Tryon park afterward.
"When I'm near Halal Guys, I go to [Adel's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/adels-famous-halal-food-new-york) instead. $6-7 ($1 cheaper), tastier, and usually no line.

In Chinatown my favorite is probably Wah Fung #1 Fast Food (huge plate of roast meat and rice for $4-5).

Or a sandwich from a bodega. My go to is chicken cutlet, toasted hero, american or pepper jack, grilled onions, cucumbers, avocado, Russian dressing, and (sometimes) bacon."
"You work at 10 am. Wake up earlier to go to the gym. Spend week nights making dinner together, watching GOT, etc. Spend weekends going out."
This is a noise complaint. Call 311.
"&gt; they are (almost) always empty/close to empty

Then you aren't looking that often."
"you can walk through Central Park  
catch up over some coffee"
"That is not the tip. If you don't want to tip on top of a totally insane delivery fee, order from a different restaurant. Don't screw the delivery guy. "
"Live in NY, grew up in Boston, visited DC 10ish times. The biggest difference is that in New York people do not give a FUCK. You do your thing, sunshine, and enjoy it. Nobody cares. We're all busy with our own shit.

Compare that to Boston, where wearing a Yankees hat will get you at minimum verbal abuse in virtually any neighborhood. Wearing swag for any team in New York won't get you a second glance."
"$1 or $2 per drink, yeah"

"This is an awfully broad question. 

Queens has the shortest wait for new books because they hardly ever have that many holds.

Some of their videos have a 3-day checkout period. Usually you can renew them, but not always, so be careful.

Brooklyn lets you renew items the most times.

NYPL's website is the best one.

The Mid-Manhattan library checks your bags when you leave. Don't act offended about it. (Though, it's going to be closing August 1 for renovation and their items disbursed to other locations, so check it out while you still can.)

Worldcat isn't linked to Queens.

Just because the catalogue says an item is on the shelf doesn't mean it's actually there. 

Queens is good about buying books if you suggest ones that they don't have.

In all three systems, many staff members have an unfortunate tendency not to be that friendly or helpful. But if you need help, ask anyway - it's their job, make them do it."
B&amp;H Photo Video is closed on Saturdays.
"Lots of people own cars in Manhattan, as illustrated by all the cars parked in Manhattan.  It's a royal pain in the ass, but lots of people do it."
"If you could get a friend to come with you and split the cost you could book a hotel room for a night at a place with an outdoor pool. A quick look at hotels.com shows The Watson Hotel and Travel Inn Hotel for about $150 a night. You could probably even show up the morning of the reservation and ask if you can hang out by the pool until your room is ready to be checked into and get 2 days or more out of booking for 1 night. Or search around more than i did and find a place for $80 a night, maybe priceline. "
"It's because it's not actually weed. It's just weed flavored. Like how you can call a sleeve of ice with sugar ""Strawberry"" or ""Grape"" regardless of the absence of strawberry or grape in either. "
yo that shit's gone
"The short answer is, it is illegal to lock out a tenant without an eviction order, and doing so can entitle the lease breaking tenant to triple damages. "
Is Guy Fieri's place still open? Cause that. 
"Never too paranoid. You do not want to deal with having bedbugs, it's a fucking nightmare. My ordeal ended almost 2 years ago and I still freak out every time I find a bug bite on me."
"Greenwich Village is shortened to ""the Village"" not to ""Greenwich."" When someone here hears ""Greenwich"" they tend to think of Greenwich, CT."
Woorijip (which is down the block from Hmart on 32nd stret) specializes in grab n' go Korean.  They have a range of prepacked banchan. You can also buy prepared food by the pound.
