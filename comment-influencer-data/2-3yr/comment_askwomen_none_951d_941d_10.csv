Other people proposing.
"One of my sisters is a bonafide walking rom com stereotype. And for a long time didn't understand why she couldn't find ""the one"". Always has had relationship issues. Doesn't know why. 

A few years ago she was dating this dude. She tells him she loves him. He doesn't say it back so she freaks out. Calls me. Tells me she feels like an idiot. Like she's vulnerable. She's gonna have to break up with him bc she's mortified he didn't say it back. He was gonna have to make a grand gesture to prove it and motivate her to stay. I tell her to give it a few days to see what happens. 

Dude tells her he was caught by surprise. Didn't know she felt the same. He was in love with her too. Asked her to move in. 

Then she breaks up with him, bc it was *too* grand and moving too fast. 


Repeat this cycle for years. "
"I know he keeps a little list somewhere of things I mention I would like to buy for myself but can't justify so he can buy me these things.

Whenever I mention something like that he'll ask very specific questions about it like ""Oh really, where exactly would you buy it? Do you have a color preference?"".

I've gotten things that I've mentioned once in passing like a year ago so there is no way he could just remember. He thinks he's being *so nonchalant* with the questions but I'm on to him. "
Or announcing pregnancies.
I went to one where the fathers of the bride and groom (both well off) went around during the reception with baskets asking people to contribute cash towards the cost of the wedding. 
"I had one several years ago. I was in college, the father said he had other things he wanted to do first.there was no sense of wanting it or impending motherhood. It was closer to being diagnosed with something fatal. I just wanted it gone.   

We went to a planned parenthood nearby. They're both friendly and stark lonely places. The receptionist was behind bullet proof glass but she asked me if it was okay to call the number I had provided or should they pretend to be someone else. They care, truly, about the fate of the *woman* and understand she may not be coming there from a safe and understanding place.   

The doctor was a woman, a Catholic, she told me. I hadn't learned yet to tense myself mentally for the hate and the shame catholics or conservatives would causally throw at me. I would, but then I didn't need to. She was so kind. She said someday I was going to be a wonderful mother but that just wasn't right now. She told me I was going to be okay.   

I was 6 weeks. She did an ultrasound and assured me the fetus was maybe the size of half my pinky fingernail. She asked if I wanted a print out. My boyfriend at the time said keeping evidence like that lying around was a mistake. I said I did. I remember thinking I needed a marker. Someone needed to stop and take notice.   

Under 9 weeks and you just take a series of pills. The first blocks progesterone which halts the pregnancy in its tracks. The second (taken the next day, in my private dorm room with only my then boyfriend to supervise) contracts the uterus expelling everything. The doctor took great pains to tell me I'd see clots, maybe some as big as my fist, but that it absolutely was not the fetus. It would be too small to pick out.   She said it would be painful and prescribed me pain pills to help with the pain. I resolved mentally not to take them. It's never too soon to start nailing yourself to your cross. 

I took the pill. I remember thinking I should ask for alone time so I could say goodbye. I felt like I was letting it down. I had this one job and I wasn't up to it. I didn't ask for alone time. They also give you antibiotics to ward off infection as your body sheds a bunch of dead tissue and blood. We stopped at the stop and shop for soup and other sick-in-bed foods. Part way through shopping I became violently nauseous. I shoved my debit card into his hands, blurting the pin, and running for the car. I made it to the car and managed to get inside and lean out the passenger door in order to vomit.   

Back in my little dorm, I took the expelling pill. The pain made lying still impossible,are staying silent impossible. I had roommates (suite of private rooms) and one of them had already called me evil for my pro choice views even before that day. I was terrified of anyone finding out. I took the pain pills, I couldn't stop shaking, I was cold. My then boyfriend topped me with all the blankets I had and then when the didn't stop the shaking, he got laundry and piled that on.   

I needed help going to the bathroom, I stood as straight as I could to walk to the bathroom so no one would see. It fucking hurt so much. I don't remember much about that day  except I think we got Chinese food first. And he put on Indiana Jones while I was in bed.   

Things go on. If I had to give you one piece of advice, it's this : don't go through this alone. If you're struggling to cope go find someone to talk to. I never realized my behavior, hiding liquor bottles, binge drinking, drinking alone, were problematic until much later. My failure to cope appropriately nearly killed me.  I let myself be walled off and I was too proud to seek help. I'm lucky to be alive today.   

You are going to be okay. Nearly 10 years later and I believe it to be both the best and the worst thing to have happened to me. I don't regret the choice at all, never once. "
"Yell at my kids.

I planned to be nice and kind always, to have empathy for them 24/7. But the reality is, sometimes I'm exhausted and they are being jackasses, so yelling happens."
"DAE weddings are worthless and too expensive? I had mine for 3 dollars and some pocket lint, I'm so much smarter than all those other people! /s

But like these people also often save money by having a friend be a hairdresser, using someone's large back yard, and using a restaurant as caterers. Some people don't have those opportunities/friends and few restaurants cater here. Also after a life of working weddings I want a swank wedding with my own money and you can fight me "
"&gt; Then she breaks up with him, bc it was too grand and moving too fast. 

What.

"My brother and his dating life. 

He does not want to date a girl less smart than him because he wants someone who can keep up intellectually. 

He does not want to date someone smarter than him because it makes him insecure. 

So his dating requirements are someone exactly the same amount of smartness as him. "
"How much better I would feel immediately afterwards and how much worse people would make me feel about it later on.

No regrets though!"
"HOW HAS NO ONE SAID GARTER TOSS YET?

Seriously, let my future husband dig up my skirt in front of all my closest friends and family. So uncomfortable. I understand if you might think it's sexy or fun, but it's always struck me as creepily exhibitionist. "
Fights. Just please don't fucking start. 
"Gonna go with Ross. Largely because he lied to Rachel about their divorce and let them stay married for months without her knowledge.

Plus he is whiny as shit."
"I've never dealt with it from coworkers, but clients on the other hand..

If I can't fix it right away it's because of my gender, if a guy can't it must be really broken. And just lots of variations of that. "
"A good (male) friend of mine is in such a relationship. The girl was brought up to find a rich guy to take care of her. He always wanted a piece of pretty arm candy. From his perspective, he works a demanding job at a business he co-owns with his mom. His mom is demanding, constantly on his case about this, that and the other thing. His mom constantly wants updates, to know what's going on the business and is always focused on the next new big thing. Mom is demanding and doesn't know when to quit. Friend wants to go home to a woman who places very little expectations on him. Basically, he wants to go home, be taken care of and enjoy his very limited free time with a pretty girl.

The girlfriend wants to be taken care of and be a super-wife. She enjoys cooking, looking pretty, making small talk, and the nice life. My friend enjoys his gf's close family relationships and laid back attitude. 

Honestly, they're perfectly matched from my perspective. Their relationship may have arisen from shallow beginnings, but 6 years later they are happy. They meet each other's needs and there is genuine caring between them. 

Would it work for me? No. I'm too focused on my career and career goals. But I can see the appeal for both parties. "

"Someone posting a question asking women for their opinion on something (usually related to dating/men), women answering honestly and then the majority of the replies being butt-hurt men trying to invalidate and pick apart their answers."
"I get so, so tired around 9:30-10:00 most nights. I've left two different social events around 10 this past week, because I just wanted to go home and get into bed. "
"lol, i feel like almost every guy who wants a ''smart woman'' has this problem, at least in my experience. smart enough to understand their brilliance but no more than that. same goes with being funny. funny = laughs at my jokes but never outshines me in social situations."

"Maybe not the *worst* - but definitely one that is consistent: The friend who complains people don't like or confide in her - but as soon as someone does, she makes fun of them, tells them why they're wrong for feeling/doing/thinking that, then talks bad about them behind their backs (""I mean, I'm not judging or anything, but...""). She does it indiscriminately, so it only takes a couple weeks of knowing her to realize she's doing it to you, too. 

She was furious when she felt like I wasn't ""including her in big things in my life"" - but I'd decided I don't need that kind of negativity. If I felt like I could trust her with little things, I might try trusting her with big things, but that's just not the case."
"The hacky-comedianish circlejerk about how sex ends the second you get married. 

And the STEM circlejerk. You know, ""oh you have an arts degree? I'll have a latte"" thing."
"i'm about to turn 30 and have no career, no savings, and a mountain of student debt (but not much outside that, thankfully). my friend and i were at a mall recently at like 11am on a tuesday and it all just sank in like... jesus, why am i such a loser?"
"my friend: ""I'm just a super chill girl, you know? Like a guy's girl.  Hate drama, love sports, don't play games.  Guys are always saying how chill I am.  I'm not like other girls!'

my friend: *obsessively stalks the social media of her (now ex) boyfriend for any signs of contact with other females...shows up at his apartment without an invitation late at night when he takes too long to text her back...drives across multiple state lines to 'surprise him' when he is on vacation with his family because she is worried his family is trying to talk him out of being with her...can only communicate through arguments and picks fights over things as small as what he orders on his burrito (yes, seriously)*

my friend: ""Why do his friends and family think I'm crazy?  I'm such a no drama girl! I hate fighting! He's always picking fights with me...why doesn't he want to spend all of his time with me when I'm so chill????????"""
"This is definitely going to get downvoted, but from a person who generally *really* likes babies, I think it's tacky to bring babies or children who are still in diapers to a wedding. Or at least the ceremony part. It's not like they're getting anything out of it, and babies aren't exactly known for being silent.

And if you must bring your baby to a wedding ceremony, at least take them outside to soothe them when they begin crying during the vows instead of letting them wail for the rest of the event."
"I used to work technical support, and the graveyard shift manager used to be a woman. One time a known sexist client called in, and got one of the female reps. He immediately refuses to work with her because she's a woman and hung up. He calls back in, gets another female rep, and the same thing happens. At this point the manager has been made aware, so she passes the number around to everyone on the night shift and tells them not to answer unless they are female. Guy apparently went in circles for ages before finally accepting he would have to work with a woman if he wanted to solve his problem. That manager was my hero."

"My SO, when we have to go to any place he began to do things then we don't have enough time and we have to hurry to not being late.

It's been like 7 years and I still stay up at night sometimes thinking about how crazy she is. This is just the tip of the iceberg "
"- I got my first liver spot on my hand a few years ago. That made me feel pretty old.

- I often walk by a mirror and see my mom in the mirror. No big deal. But a year or two ago, I saw my grandma in my face and was like, ""WHOA! Hold up there!""

- Not exactly a physical thing, but I want to add it anyway: Being older than nearly all of the other parents of my daughter's classmates. I was only 34 when I had her; it's not like I was 45 or anything! "
"""Because I said so."" After the 18th 'Why?'"
"Workplace is fine. But what I have noticed is my boyfriend and I both develop, but when we meet people (especially men) they ask what he does, but don't bother asking what I do. "
"Choreographed dances, especially during the ceremony. I don't know why this bugs me so much but I find it super tacky and cringe so hard from second hand embarrassment."
"More of a past surprise than a secret, but he spent countless hours working on an incredible handmade christmas gift for me and made me promise not to look in the room it was in because he wanted it to 100% be a surprise. I was good and never went in the room, but one day he wanted to show me something on facebook and opened it on his phone...you know how the app sometimes displays the most recent photos from your phone for quick and easy posting? He had taken a picture of it in progress and it popped up for a fraction of a second. I don't think he realized, but I saw it and pretty much instantly recognized what it was going to be. I'll never, ever tell him I knew exactly what he was making me. He worked so hard on it and wanted it to be a special surprise. "
"Dogs do not live as long as humans.
You know it, I know it, I conveniently blocked it from my mind when I got my dogs six years ago.

My girl Freya's medical issues got the best of her this week and I had to hold her while she went into the big sleep. I know my boy has - at most - two to four years left (he's a Great Dane).
I feel like of all the animals in the world dogs deserve to live the longest. I miss my Freya so much."
Dressing provocatively or wearing club wear to a wedding. Especially in a church. It's just weird to be attention seeking when the day isn't about you.
Have you considered having the right opinion? 
"Mine was easy! I took the pill route and while the day of was painful and the hormones left me a little batty for a week or two afterward, I expected it to be some heavy serious soul-crushing experience and it wasn't. Not in the least. I've had more stressful dentist appointments. 

That said, fuck anybody who tells you how to feel or makes you think you ought to think or feel about it in one way over another. "
"I can imagine him coming downstairs saying ""look what I found in the attic"" holding pristine boxes"
Wow. Cringed hard reading that. 
"I'm gonna stay up tonight thinking how crazy your sister is now. 

only tonight though. "
"I don't know if this counts as keeping a secret from me in particular but oh well; while everyone else's boyfriends have cute secrets, mine bought a subscription for a porn site and I found out through an email notification on his phone. 
Why not watch porn like a normal person....?
For free?

"People getting really really drunk.  

One of my SO's friends got super drunk and climbed on the roof of the reception hall at our friends' wedding.  *That* is why people are wary about open bar."
"This is a weekly conversation in my office:


Me ""This isn't going to work because of these reasons""

Male coworker ""Nah it's fine not an issue at all.""

Male boss ""Yea it'll be fine""

A few days later.

Male coworker ""Hey this isn't working because of these reasons""


Male boss ""Oh no. That's a huge problem. Let's arrange a meeting so we can talk about the issues and potential solutions""

"Several years ago, I looked over at my boyfriend and in a major moment of clarity, I realized I HATED him. Not just as a boyfriend, as a human being, I HATED him. I hated everything he stood for, I hated how he treated me, I hated how he was a misogynist ""feminist"", I hated when he touched me, I hated having to bring him anywhere, I just hated his face.

I broke up with him a couple days later and didn't tell him all that, just that we were going in two very different directions and I didn't see us working out. Afterwards I insisted on being single to figure out who I was and what I wanted in life, because I sure knew then that I didn't want some idiot man telling me what I should do and think. Also, you insult my Dad, and I'll fucking cut you."
"I went to one in which the pastor not only went off the script to talk about gay marriage but also talked about how men are different than women and have urges, so that's why they cheat sometimes and women have to understand. The pastor's wife was there, btw"

"My face looks like my mom, and my mom is a highly narcissistic person, so I have had trouble with that."

"You won't make it ahead of all the people who started out with advantages that were snobby when you were a kid. There are no Biff's, even if you're smarter and hard working, advantages of wealth and caring parents with time and education really snowball effect your success in life. 

And, of course, a lot of those people do grow out of being spoiled bullies. It serves no one to begrudge them of their success. It's just better to fight for better for the upcoming generations."
"I wish I had known how much havoc hormones can cause to your emotions. I knew I needed to terminate but I wasn't prepared for my body being like nooooooo we need a baaaabbbbyyyyyy. I really had to listen to my head over my heart. Years later, I'm SO glad I did!"
"I've never liked the ""stealing the bride"" thing. Fake kidnapping the bride, and people have to chip in money to return her to the reception. I don't see it often, fortunately."
"Here's what I got:

I was added to an FB group that was specifically for the wedding. All part of the ""announcement"" and ""planning for The Big Day!""

Then there was a link for the ""finance our honeymoon"" thing where I was supposed to donate to the honeymoon. 

When the bride updated the site, we all got a notification that a new ""honeymoon"" item was added, along with a reminder from her to buy the couple a hotel room, a dinner or drinks after the Big Day on their two-week trip to Jamaica. 

If she found gaps, she posted in the group that ""no one bought anything for Tuesday evening if you still want to donate!""

I was added to the Facebook event when my donation of two drinks at the resort showed up. In other words, the event was already there, but I wasn't added until I bought something. 

I was fuming at that point and declined -- something came up and I couldn't attend. 

That was my dignity. 

My friend who attended said the wedding was ""ok"" but less than half showed up and it was clear there were tables and food planned for more people. She ended up taking home about 150 chicken wings. 

"
"""Describe your dream guy."" I describe dream guy and get downvoted because they don't fit the description. Welp."
"Oh God. This almost happened at mine. I had a *beautiful* wedding. Live jazz band, amazing cocktails/bar/apps/meal; I tried for an effortlessly classy (but laid back) feel. Everything was great. The ceremony was perfect. The band learned a jazz number my grandfather had written, so we danced our first dance to my grandpa's music. The flowers were gorgeous, etc. Everyone was having an absolutely amazing time. 

Until my alcoholic uncle slipped his hand up my brand new brother in law's girlfriend's dress, grabbing her vulva!! Apparently it happened out of sight to most guests, but things escalated to the point where my shitfaced uncle denied everything, accused the gf of lying to make my BIL jealous, and then challenged my BIL to a fight. Note- my bil is super fit and in the navy, he's also a paramedic. The dude is not to be messed with, despite his boyish good looks. My husand is a cop. Their father is a cop. My uncle is a zoftic middle-aged  alcoholic. Thankfully, my FIL was clued in to the issue very quietly and escorted my uncle away, giving him the option to leave in his own, or to leave in handcuffs. 

I didn't find out until the day after, because my new family didn't want to ruin the otherwise perfection of the day. I suggested for my BIL's gf to press charges, that I backed her 100%, but she didn't want to. The uncle has been cut out not only from my life, but from my entire family's. My brother, all my cousins, my parents, and my aunt/uncle do not speak to him anymore. He isn't included in family events at all. 

I'm so thankful there wasn't a fight, but I will always have the knowledge that a woman, a friend, felt unsafe at *my* wedding. It's tainted. I can't imagine if there actually was violence. It would have absolutely tarnished everything. "

"23 years later, I still consider it the best decision I ever made."
"I got a text about a month ago from my landlord telling me she was selling the triplex I live in. She jokingly (I think) asked if I wanted to buy it. Well.. I just put in an offer yesterday! So not only am I going to buy a house, on my own, at 28 years old when I never wanted to own a home, with barely enough money in the bank and tons of students loan debt and a full-time hellish job - I'm also going to be a landlord. I feel like I'm setting myself up to fall flat on my face and ruin my life. :)"

"My friend Paul dates the women who give the reddest of red flags. I'd understand if he couldn't catch them but the women TELL him themselves. The last time he dated a woman who had an entire blog about, with her words, what a mess she is about relationships. Before that it was a woman who told him she couldn't move on from her last relationship. I think he has ""I can change her"" hero syndrome but I'm shocked this still goes on after 10 years of the same things happening over and over again."
I do this to my husband because he loathes it and the acrobatics he does to get away are delightful 
"They are just crazy after awhile.

She told everyone she had diabetes.  Most of my older family (mom, dad, 3 aunts) work in the medical field.  One aunt - who is the head of her department in a major hospital - asked her which type 1 or 2.  Sister responds that it's not like that.

Aunt tells her those are the medical definitions of diabetes.  

Sister says western medicine has her fooled.


She comes home for a visit, our dad makes her take like 6 diabetes tests.  She doesn't have it.  She then tells us it's because her husbands spirit cured her.


~~~~~~

She got married in secret, didn't tell anyone.  Left her husband, came back to our country. Just called him her boyfriend, so we didn't know. One of our aunts happened to be visiting at that time, and I had just gotten married as well.  Aunt gave me this really pretty necklace and matching bracelet because I was her first niece to get married. 

Sister gets jealous, angrily interjects that she got married 4 months prior to me.  

Without batting an eye aunt goes, ""first niece that was honest about her marriage""


This is also how I found out my sister was married."
"Ugh, and the cake toppers that show the bride dragging the groom. Really anything that implies that one party isn't there under their own free will. Shit's not funny."

"First of all, you're not alone. Many of us have walked this road before you. I know it's scary, but please know that it will be ok. I'll share my story, but if you have any questions, please let me know!

Over the summer I had an issue with my spine which left me unable to sit upright. We found out it was a herniated disc. We tried all non-surgical options first (physical therapy, steroid injections, narcotic pain meds, etc). Eventually it got worse, so we ended up having to schedule surgery to fix the issue. The day of the surgery, my parents and boyfriend were at the hospital with me. They did a pregnancy test (routine procedure before an operation). After a while, they had asked everyone to leave and spoke to me privately. Turns out my test came back positive. I asked them to bring my boyfriend (now fiancé) in. I told him. We both cried (happy tears). It was a shock, but I wasn't scared. We want to have kids, so I think initially we were going to keep it. My mom even said she was thrilled. Not the best timing, but a happy surprise.

After speaking with my doctors, it was clear that they would not move forward with the much needed surgery. If I were to keep the child, I was risking permanent nerve damage to myself. Additionally, we met with my OB, and she explained that with all the meds I'd been on, and all the procedures I've already had done, that it was unlikely that the fetus would be viable. We scheduled the abortion for the following week.

When in the room for the procedure, there were several nurses with me, getting me ready. I turned to one of them and asked if I would remember the procedure. She responded ""it's my job to make sure that you don't"". That is the last thing I remember. Afterwards, I had some cramping and general discomfort, but that passed within a few days. Physically, the procedure itself wasn't too bad. I'm lucky that I had really good care-my doctors made sure I was comfortable. 

For me, it was an extremely hard decision to make. I'm still pretty heartbroken about it. Luckily my partner has been supportive. I know it's different for everyone, and some women are not as heartbroken about it (that's OK too!). Just remember whatever you're feeling is normal, every woman handles it differently. Do what's best for yourself and your future. 

If you have any questions, I'm more than happy to answer. Sending you big hugs and wishing you the best of luck.
"
"Right. People like this don't really want an intelligent partner. She would be hard to control. They just want someone ""smart enough"" to agree with him and tell him how right he is and how smart he is. These are the kinds of guys who can't handle disagreement or debate, because their egos get wrapped up in their opinions, so they dismiss everyone who isn't on board. They determine who is ""smart"" by who agrees with them 100% without question. 
"
"&gt; Guys are always saying how chill I am. I'm not like other girls!

People like that are a huge red flag that screams ""STAY AWAY I LOVE DRAMA"""
"To add to your point, there are a *ton* of people who think that only women want to have weddings with their whole family there. I was ready to go get hitched at a courthouse with 1 person there, but my husband wanted to make it a big family thing, and so we did a ""normal"" wedding. Vendors and family members would not allow me to me redirect them to my now husband as we made plans. It sucked. 

 only mentioning this because no matter what, it just *does not register* to anyone that maybe the groom is pushing for a big fancy wedding, not the bride. 

Edit: I don't mean to imply that wanting to have a wedding is stupid, just that only women are treated as being stupid for wanting it. 

"
"Ugh, this. To rant about a different story. A group of my friends went to Vegas to celebrate a friend's birthday. One of the girls proposed to her girlfriend and then decided to have their wedding the same night we were supposed to go to dinner for our friend. I was actually really mad that some of the group was willing and excited to go to the wedding and forgot the original reason why we were all in Vegas in the first place. Only 4-5 out of like the 20 people went to dinner and celebrated with our friend. You could tell that she was sad about it. Everyone's​ attention went on the couple as they were getting dolled up for the wedding. The girl that proposed ended up ruining and leaving the other girl later on so it all just seemed so selfish. She was just a really selfish person and I'm glad she's gone.

"She followed a dude she just met to Canada because her spirit guides - one of which is our dead Ohma - told her that she would meet her soulmate there.  How did she find out what her spirit guides said? She went to a psychic, who could talk to *his* spirit guides, who then talked to hers, then relayed the information back to him, so he could tell her.

What was the guys job you ask? He built bicycles out of bamboo.


Annnnd while there she met another dude in a cafe and ditched bamboo boy for him"
"Moisturizing their face.  I know a lot of guys won't do it because it's ""gay,"" but it's actually very good for your skin, can help slow aging, and feels great and relaxing.

"Oh my gosh this! My best friend in college  (we don't speak anymore,  oddly enough) thought it was SO CUTE when the video of another guy proposing to a bridesmaid at her friend's wedding made it around Facebook.

Get your own. "
"Planning that doesn't take into account guests' basic needs or comfort. Examples:

- There's over an hour between the end of the ceremony and the beginning of the reception, and guests aren't allowed to hang out at either the ceremony site or the reception site during this time.
- The guests have to spend a significant amount of time outdoors and aren't informed of this ahead of time, so everyone is uncomfortable because they dressed for a wedding, not for two hours spent outdoors. "

"""He asked you out and seems nice enough, give it a shot!""    
    
The worst date of my life came from me saying yes to a guy I was never attracted to (physically or on a personal level). I never should have said yes, but was persuaded by friends and family to go out with him because he had asked me out. It was just a terrible experience all around."
"I also think that things have changed socially.

Our parents had a clear definition of the path to success - get a job, get married, buy a house. Some went to school, some didn't. At the time - it wasn't as horrific if you did or didn't. And most of this happened well before you hit 30.

But now - the social climate has changed.
School costs a lot of money - and the loans are predatory. So pile on the debt. 
Not to mention skilled labor isn't as acceptable as it used to be - now everyone ""should"" go to college (spoiler alert - no they shouldn't). 

People are getting married later - we don't rush into it, we have premarital sex (and it's not that big of a deal). We move more slowly. Despite the fact people always say ""oh half of all marriages end in divorce"" - that statistic is from like the '70s or something and isn't as true anymore, I don't think. 

Then - buying a house? First of all, it isn't like it used to be from a financial standpoint. The equity just doesn't have the same impact on your financial future. 

Yet - we all learned that ""path to success"" from our parents and their parents - that says we should have all of these things in line by now. That by 30, we should be solid and functioning just like they were - and if we aren't we are losers. Nah.

The truth is, our children - and the next few generations will learn new definitions of success - new timelines for achieving what is important, and this feeling will get less and less. Just like everything else. 

We are just of a series of generations caught in that gray are where we believe one thing, but are living another.

Also - let's not forget that social media heightens the effects of all this. We see others, we compare, we get information at an insane rate. Even if things have ""always been this way"" people were more cut off from the comparison that occurs at rocket speed.

You are doing fine. It's society and the rules that have shifted - but no one told you.

The life you are living - it's cool, it's worthwhile, and it is awesome.

If you've got time to spare and want to feel better - check out [Volunteer Match](http://www.volunteermatch.org/). Find something fun to do once or twice a week that helps out. It will make you feel better and might actually open you up to new people and opportunities. 

Just keep trying to move forward. You got this."
"I skipped this and the bouquet toss at my wedding. Both my husband and I were weirded out by the tradition. 

So instead, we had our MC ask the audience how long they'd been married, narrowing it down until we got the couple who had been married the longest. 

Then we gave them the bouquet. It was really sweet, they were so surprised and adorable.

This is a real problem that people need to be made aware of.  Intermediate spirit guides are absolutely terrible at relaying messages.  It's like a paranormal game of whisper down the lane.  She was probably supposed to meet her soulmate in Grenada.

"That's not.. a great psychologist. You don't hit an age barrier and suddenly grow out of self-esteem issues. You still need to learn strategies to mitigate these issues, and actively work toward over coming them.

I'm in my late 20s, and I have tons of self loathing. Is it necessarily diagnosable? It depends on the perspective of the clinician, but it's definitely something that's not limited to an age group."
"I got really drunk on my birthday and a friend smushed half a cake on my face. I hopped in my friend's shower to wash the cake off myself and I fell in the shower (because alcohol) and hurt my back/hip.

"This is a traditional thing found in Eastern Europe.  Think Macedonia, Serbia, Hungary, Romania.  I'm getting married in Romania next year and my fiance already warned me this would be something that happens.  

Basically, groomsman fake grabs me and I run to go have a coffee or a drink or something.  Best friends of my fiance will then be offered increasing things to bring me back.  Usually the end is a case of beer or someones suit jacket or something in good humor.  It has historical roots, but now isn't anything more harmful than wearing a veil or something"
"My friend is in a relationship with a guy.  Has 2 kids with him.  He works,  she's a stay at home Mom.  Turns out he's cheating on her,  not paying the bills etc.  They get evicted,  kids go to her Mom's.  She gets help from the state &amp; /or Red Cross (can't remember)  because she's homeless. Staying at a motel with a voucher.  He's off doing his thing.  Until he turns up because he ""has no place to go"" . 
She lets him stay with her because he's her baby daddy blah blah blah. They move from one motel to another together.  Paying weekly. 

She's upset because he still has girlfriends.  Even tho she swears to me that they ""aren't together"" 
She works.  So does he.  They decide to get an apartment together so they can co-parent better. 

Lasts roughly 6 months because he has a more serious girlfriend and isn't contributing.  So she's homeless again.  Kids are back with her mom who is now battling  cancer.  She is upset because he can't be an adult and take care of his kids. 

She now has a roommate and I hope she's going to be ok.  But he moved in with them because he ""has nowhere to go""  and she thinks he's banging the roommate.  And she's bothered by it. 
But I want to grab her and shout ""What did you expect to happen? “"
"Crying. I never understood why my mother always cried when me and my sisters were accomplishing stuff at school or during sport events. Especially if we had a show at school and had a solo. She's so emotional and would always feel proud. + during weddings and other ""emotional"" events - she would be the one sobbing.

Now I cry all the time. Thanks mom. "
"For example, I have a weird disinterest in anyone who poses with a fish they caught. I'm not a vegan or vegetarian, it's just a turn off. I admit that it's very weird and superficial. "
"When I graduated from college and got my first adult job and moved into a shitty apartment, my dad looked me in the eye and said very seriously ""Live here as long as you can.""

A year after I started working at my first job, I said ""Hey dad!  I got a raise!""  He said ""Congratulations!  Pretend you didn't!""

It is so, so, so hard to roll back your lifestyle to something with less luxury.  But try as hard as you can not to roll forward.  Once you get a smart phone, you're never going back to a flip phone.  Once you move into a nice apartment, you're never going to pay $300 a month to live in somebody's basement.

The fact that I was living paycheck to paycheck was all the indication I needed that I was a person with the tendency to live beyond my means.  And the only way that was ever going to change was by pretending my means were less, mentally treating any windfall as if it doesn't exist and sticking it directly into my savings account, and setting up an automatic transfer in the amount of my raise into my savings account every month.

Now, after 10 years, I've gotten enough raises and job growth that I don't need to worry about money anymore.  But I know that if I ever move into a nicer house, or get a new car, or take on any other recurring expense that I don't have the cash to cover, I'll need to worry about money again.  So I try as hard as I can not to do those things."
"Now this is just my theory, but I'd say that the reason they all end up too far back is because of butts/snug undies. Unless I'm wearing underwear that's right on the verge of being too big, the gusset is too far back because I need more of the undies on my booty than in the front, so all the fabric is kinda shifted and pulled that direction. Judging by the sheer number of pantylines I see on a given day, I'd say that in general women are wearing their undies pretty snug. 

Again, I'm no underwear scientist but that's my theory. "
"2 things:

1- feed my kid like shit. Sometimes you have to give up on your dream of a spinach salad for your kid because it's either mac and cheese or nothing because they won't eat. 

2- buy a minivan. I don't have one yet but 100% if I have a third kid no doubt I will get a minivan. I thought they were lame and that I'd never be ""that mom."" Now I could give a shit if they're lame; they're awesome and there is a reason families all buy them. "

"This happened to me several years ago when I was with my ex-boyfriend and it was one of the most genuinely terrifying experiences of my life. 

Several times a week during this time I would stay over my boyfriend's house. It was quite old, like most houses around here, nothing special about it. But what did stand out about it is that every girl who visited it picked up bad vibes about the place. 

At the time 3 other guys were living there too and their girlfriends stayed over, same as me. None of us liked being in the house alone, which ended up being quite often as the boys all played in a band together. If I was alone there, I would hide in the living room with the tv blaring trying to distract myself from how utterly creeped out and watched I felt. 

My boyfriend's job involved him getting up very early, often before 4am and then returning about 10am. I was doing my MA at the time so I had plenty of opportunities to sleep in, which I did. This was one of those mornings. 

I was woken first by someone touching my hair. I assumed it was my ex and looked up expecting to see him, but there was no one there. I was quite creeped out but not enough that I was going to get up early so I brushed it off as me dreaming and went back to sleep. 

I woke up again lying flat on my back, which I never do. I always sleep stomach down. 

Standing over me was a very tall, very well-built woman of maybe 50 dressed in clothes from the around the late 70s. She was going absolutely fucking ballistic at me, screaming with total rage at me whilst pointing her fingers at me. I couldn't hear her words; it was as if she was speaking to me through a wall of water, but I lay there absolutely terrified with tears of fear in my eyes, watching her scream. 

Finally something snapped and she was gone. I was hyperventilating. Absolutely petrified, I got up and dressed as fast as I could, grabbed my stuff and left the house for the train station. I was horrified. I couldn't believe what had just happened. Normally I'd put that down to sleep paralysis, but it was so real, so vivid, that it was nothing like any sleep paralysis I'd ever had. 

I found out shortly afterwards that a woman had died in that house, in her 50s. I never stayed there alone again. 

Sometimes though when I'd be in bed waiting to doze off, I'd feel this column of sheer cold next to my side of the bed. I'd have to shut my eyes and imagine (for some reason) a white light surrounding my ex and I and eventually it would get warmer, as if whatever had been there had left. 

Awful, awful house. "

"People forget that the default is invisible because it's the default. The majority of rich kids do very well; that's why the Worthless Asshole Trust Fund Kids are so noticeable.

More insidiously, people think that weathering hardship, in and of itself, makes them a better and stronger person. ""I had to work full-time through college, and that makes me better than the folks who just had to study."" It doesn't work like that. The folks who got to study full-time get to learn the material even more thoroughly while you're flipping burgers.

Having obstacles to success might make you work harder and do better than the lazy kids, but it puts you behind the kids who work hard *and* have zero obstacles."

Blurry/dark pictures. Pictures of them with 8,000 other guys that all look the same and you can't tell who is the owner of the profile. Shirtless pics. Pics of them with dead animals/hunting/with guns or knives. 

Empty profiles, phrases like ""I'm not like other guys"" or ""I don't like myself, I'm crazy about myself."" ""Texting"" talk instead of using full words on their profile. 

I could keep going but I think I've covered about 95% of the profile out there."

"I don't know if this comes under undervaluing as such but at my work, many men show up early, dick around for a long time in the name of ""discussing ideas""(they fucking don't) and start working only after around noon, they stay late till they finish the work. Since the clocked in&amp;out time is considered they regularly clock 10+ hours a day. This is seen as ""hard-working"" by highers up. 

It's infuriating because when women leave exactly after we clock the time we're paid for, we're seen as ""soft"", ""fragile"", ""weak"" - basically not hard working enough. They throw dirty looks when we get ready to leave for the day. (But I personally don't give a fuck. That's all they can do). We work smart damnit. We try to minimise wasting time because most of us would like to go home as soon as we can.

Many of the women have children/family/something to attend to. They can't afford to dick around like that. 

But that's hardly acknowledged. Men get all the credit because they are ""working their asses off"". What the actual fuck? I wish I was in a position to reprimand such people. 

What's with middle aged white men and ""hard-working""? Isn't what you do more important than the hours you put in?"

"abrathatfits, i'm looking at you. i used your bra calculator. i had faith. sure, my ''true size'' (75F) gives me amazing boobs and lift because having a band that cuts into you keeps those things defying gravity. but they're also 50+ euros apiece.

i just went to a sale yesterday on whim, tried on the biggest bra available (85D). and you know what? it fits just fine. yes, the gore is flat against my chest. no, the band is not so loose it is riding up, though i did have to hook it on the second of four levels. and it's in a smooth, simple, T-shirt style that is so hard to find at the speciality shops.

not amazing cleavage like with my others, but much more comfortable for daily wear. and i got 4 of them for less than the price of one ''true size'' bra. sure, i knew about sister sizes (and this is a sister size) but the gospel says the band will be way too loose and you'll regret it, and the boob fat will punish you by becoming back rolls, or something.

i CAN shop where normally-boobed women shop! i'm freeeee!"
"All those ""Personality matters more to women"" or ""The only thing that matters is looks"". How about a combination of both? I don't know many women who don't take into account both their attraction to a man and how he treats her, etc. when dating. I don't see why it has to be one or the other that's the formula. Sure, some women only care about one or the other, but a lot take into account multiple things when looking for someone. "
"I have one co-worker, the head of another sub department, who always comes to me asking questions, then second guesses my answer, but if my male counterpart tells him the same thing he takes it as gospel.

"For men, toxic masculinity is the pressure for men to act a certain ""masculine"" way (that they may not even want to) that ultimately ends up hurting them and those around them. ""Toxic feminity"" would probably include the same pressure but with reciprocal behaviors of toxic masculinity. 

For example the pressure to be polite and ""assert your femininity"" by staying pleasant to men. This might include staying quiet when a work colleague takes credit for your work, not asking questions, saying yes to a man who asks you out because it is ""nice"", and ultimately **staying in situations where you are uncomfortable because you do not want to appear impolite.**  "
"Oh god he's even jealous of her spending time at WORK instead of with him.

"I know he bought albums for artists he'd never listened to before so he could pretend to be into what I liked. I always suspected but the jig was truly up when he asked me things like who a track off the Kanye album he owned was and being confused by cat noises when I put his Meow the Jewels album on. I'm pretty sure he'd never listened to Queen either, still in the plastic wrap, he immediately listened to them obsessively for 3 months after we opened them.

"Last year I knew my boyfriend saw the shirt I was cross-stitching for him even though he tried to cover his tracks. I decided to put it aside, in the hopes he would eventually forget it so I could surprise him randomly, and work on something else for his Christmas gift. Christmas rolls around and he's super excited to unwrap his gifts! He's happy with everything... until he unwraps the last one, his face drops, he asks me ""Is that it?"" I'm like, ""Uh, Is three gifts not enough now?"" He got embarrassed and ended up admitting he was expecting the t-shirt and was looking forward to seeing how it turned out. Oops 🤷‍♀️🎉 "
"Same, my coworkers are chill, but other people I deal with are not. I'm on the support team for a big company. Most of the time if a man drops by the office for help and I'm in there alone, he'll ask where the IT guys are - and sometimes after I say I am IT, they say, ""Oh, I'll come back later.""

I know this is fairly common but I always felt the whole bouquet and garter toss were tacky as hell. Especially pairing up the friends who caught each object. When is it not awkward? Also the groom fishing under the brides dress in front of family has always just been so cringeworthy to me. Just why? I left the whole thing out of my wedding. No need to make single friends uncomfortable by throwing shit at them. 
"Girl I used to sit across from at work - she'd constantly be on/off with her ex (for about 1.5 years after she broke up with him).

"When my childhood best friend got married, we were sent an announcement with instructions to send money to a travel agency for the bride &amp; groom's honeymoon.  Then it was included on the invitation that space was very limited and they wouldn't be inviting me to the wedding and something like ""Since you are such an important part of our lives, we know you will understand.""  It wasn't hand written, they sent the same thing to other friends of ours too.  Unbelievable.  

tldr: send us money but you can't come to our wedding "

First one was far enough that we had announced it to everyone, I was showing, etc. My nephews engagement party is coming up around the time I'll be 3-4 months and I show early. I honestly don't want to tell anyone I'm pregnant until I am so far I'm about to pop... it will probably be obvious but even if they ask, I don't want to confirm.

"She's much better now but my best friend did it with money for 2 years. She first rented a flat that was above her budget. She also continued to hang at expensive bars and order not-the-cheapest-drink and almost always drank more than a glass. So she had to move in with her older sister, her husband and their toddler when she got into debt. She was really unhappy there but to move in on own her again she had to save up money. But because she was unhappy at the house, every week day after work, she went to a pub and drank couple of drinks which cost a small fortune. (The booze is quite expensive in our country.) She also went to her FWB's house on the weekends and again hung with them and had booze. One of the main reasons why she was unhappy at her sister's house was her sister was annoyed she was never home, but she still went out every day, spent the money she needed to save up so she could move out."

"Why would the parents being well off have anything to do with it? 


My partner and I are quite minimalist. We don't want a bunch of stuff. But many people still do want to give gifts at a wedding. We are saving up for a down payment on a house - so we are saying ""your attendance is all the gift we need but if you want to provide a gift, help us with this instead"" but in a nicer way. 

My folks being well off has nothing to do with it. They aren't paying for the wedding or honeymoon or buying us a home. "

Joey may have been gross by constantly hitting on people, but I don't think we *ever* saw him do something to intentionally hurt another person, or sacrifice another person for his own happiness. Joey's misdeeds are more ignorance/his upbringing than anything. And at least even though Joey hit on everything that moved, he always got enthusiastic consent."

"My ex husband and I lived in the house where his mother died. She literally died in the house and then it was probated to him and we moved in. Nothing creepy happened for the first several years. We slept in a different room than the one she died in (she died in her sleep, very peacefully, but she was only in her 50s). She died in 2002 and I didn't start to notice creepy stuff until about 10 years later. One morning I was awoken by the sound of running water. I checked the sink in the master bath, nothing. Went down the hall and found the guest sink running full blast all the way on ""hot"" with steam coming up from the sink. Odd, but I tried to not think about it. Another time I was sitting in the living room and started to smell coffee. I went into the kitchen and the coffee pot had turned on by itself and was running - just water since there wasn't any coffee in it, but you could still smell the coffee. It was an older pot that had a flip switch too. There were also times when I would fix things around the house and when I finished I would feel this overwhelming sense of someone be thankful to me. It's hard to describe but it felt like she was saying ""thanks for fixing that"" ... it was the house she grew up in. "

"Uk here and this is the norm. Quite often there just isn't space in the ceremony room for tons of people so you have to choose your nearest and dearest. My wedding venue only allowed 35 people in the ceremony room itself. And often for the reception you want your work friends, and those who may just not be close enough to you to be at the ceremony. The reception is the best bit anyway, that's where the food, drinking and dancing is :)

"Pretty much anything involving extorting money out of people. At one wedding I attended, there was a cash box by the door that said ""please contribute to help cover the cost of the wedding"". As a guest, it had probably already cost me $500+ to attend that wedding. Clothes for husband and I, 3 gifts because I was invited to bridal shower, kitchen shower (wtf, since when is this a thing?? It's just an extra gift grab) And wedding. It was made very clear that gifts were expected at all three. What made the cash box even worse was the sister standing by it screeching ""you forgot to put money in the box!"" if someone dared  to walk by without dropping in cash. The groom was a close family member so I couldn't just refuse to go, and he didn't care about the wedding at all. The bride also registered for things that cost $2000+ then cried when she didn't get them, until her daddy bought them for her. 

Recently, because people live together now for a long time before getting married quite often, I'm seeing people register for things like flat screen TV, handbags???, video game systems, etc. What the hell? Wedding gifts were supposed to be things to help get you set up in your new life together. Sheets, towels, kitchen stuff, dishes, etc. And the trend of groom registries is incredibly tacky as well. No, I'm not going to buy you a tool just because the bride is getting a food processor. 

Edit: just clarifying, I don't think they have to register for household stuff, but registering for basically toys is tacky to me. Especially the handbag thing... that seemed insane."

"In defense of Ross Eustace Gellar (alternate title = Hello Downvotes) :

- Ross is such a sweet guy. Did you see the episode where he was supposed to be on TV and he was all excited but Rachel needed his help because she was broken or something but ROSS WAS THERE? He dropped what he had to do because he loves Rachel and he would have done that for any of the other friends. What a sweet pea. 
- He is respectable. The one where Rachel tries to get Ross to sleep with her because she's upset about her dad being in the hospital..... he doesn't do it! Because he wouldn't ever want to take advantage of her. Try to tell me that's not the right way to handle this situation. He's just the best. 
- He's adorable. The one where Rachel doesn't think her prom date is coming so Ross's family tries to get him to take her to prom. So he gets all ready and he looks all crazy with his mustache and he's so excited to take Rachel to prom and then her freakin date comes. ROSS... WHAT A MAN. He was so awkward and shy but he put Rachel first (are you sensing a theme yet?) and he was trying to step up to the plate for her. He did step up to the plate. And we're left feeling bad for Ross (as per usual) because Ross is adorable and SO under appreciated. 
- He gets into the funniest situations - leather pants, teeth whitening, tanning, PIVOT, the dancing with Monica at Dick Clark's NY Rockin Eve, and I just love it. 

And if all that isn't enough of a reason for you Ross-haters, Ross showed me I'm not the only one who would defend their sandwich to the death. Touch my sandwich. I dare you. "

Suddenly the driver hit the brakes, she lost her balance and had to take a step forward, and accidentally stepped on the hem of her dress... which then caused it to slip all the way down to her waist. She wasn't wearing a bra.

For the next 3 years she went to work 30 minutes early, to avoid getting into the same bus."

Studying to become a teacher now that Betsy DeVos is secretary of education....
Being told I'm being too aggressive just for being direct. If I don't pepper my message with emojis people assume I'm being angry. I've worked both in ops and as a dev. 
"I'm a web developer in the SF Bay Area (though now I work remotely). About 10 years ago I worked at the same company as my then-boyfriend; we met on the job and started dating 6 months after I was there. I was interviewing elsewhere for a new position and it turned out the interviewers knew my boyfriend through their network. They strongly insinuated that I had only gotten my current job because I was dating him. It didn't register right away; it wasn't until I was walking out of their office that it hit.

Now I would have confronted them professionally but firmly on it. Back then I just thought that I'm glad I dodged that bullet. Had I actually needed that job, it would have been a definite case where sexism has actively harmed me. Thankfully I had several job offers to choose from, though not from them, or I could have stayed at my existing job."
"I almost didn't comment here, because it is frustrating and exhausting as all hell to describe your experiences in response to a question and then have them systematically disbelieved, brushed off, and picked apart by people who definitely know less about my own experience than I do. That said, though, I do have some thoughts to share.

When I started my first dev job, I was the only woman on the engineering team, and honestly, I thought everything was amazing. I never doubted sexism happening in the field at large, but I was convinced that despite the homogeneous nature of the team that I had found a beautiful refuge where sexism didn't reach me. It wasn't until more women joined the engineering team and I had a chance to talk with them and more critically examine my interactions that I realized not everything was as perfect as I thought. Both I and other women on my team would be routinely talked over in meetings, interrupted in presentations, ignored when answering questions on things that we were the most knowledgeable about in favor of less experienced male team members... we do a lot of pair programming at my company, and the difference in experience of pairing with a male colleague vs. female colleague was huge. I had never realized just how little I was allowed to touch the keyboard when pairing with my male colleagues, how frequently my ideas were ignored, how frequently we'd end up going with whatever *his* plan was regardless of my input.

Since then, the company has definitely grown and taken steps forward as a place where we're able to have these types of conversation, and to acknowledge as a team that implicit biases of all types happen, it doesn't mean anyone's  bad person, and we can all work on it together. It's been a slow road, and is still far from perfect, but it's growth!

The shocking part to me was how invisible all had been, until I had other women as peers to be talking and sharing experiences with. It is so easy to feel unvalidated when noticing a little interaction that feels off - so easy to brush it aside as ""your imagination"" or something you had done wrong yourself. Women and femme-presenting people are trained to do this since Day 1, and socialized into habits that make every piece of this harder to notice and harder to resist. Men, on the other hand, are socialized in a way that also makes it hard to notice and avoid, for completely different reasons.

I mostly wanted to offer this perspective as way of speaking to both sides of the experiences shared in this thread - ""I never experienced sexism!"" vs. ""Yeah, things kind of suck"". Two years ago I would have been so solidly in the first camp, but it turned out I was just not allowing myself to acknowledge some of the less-perfect parts of my experience. Not saying this is true for everyone, but it was for me!

(Also, just want to give a shout-out to my P.O.C. coworkers, who have it just as rough or more so - it's easy to get lost in the gender conversation when it comes to the tech industry, but racial injustice is very prevalent and just as deserving of discussion!)"

"I've recently moved into my boyfriends familial home, and they really love to grow their own fruits and vegetables. I'm talking brocolli, corn, pumpkins, strawberries, watermelon, anything you can think of - it's there. One day, I thought that the cat had gotten outside because she was nowhere to be seen. while I was looking in the back yard I noticed a nectarine tree, and I went closer to have a look at it. I lifted the nectarine slightly and it was so ripe that it just fell off the branch, so I decided to eat it. 

And my god. That was the best fucking nectarine I have ever eaten. It was a white nectarine (my favourite) and perfectly sweet and ripe, but not too ripe. The flavour was incredible, and it was slightly sun warmed, making it even better. 

Unfortunately the nectarine that I ate was also the one that his sister had been watching grow for weeks, had given a name, and was really looking forward to eating. RIP Burney the nectarine, no other fruit will compare to you. "
"Not a woman, but I can't resist on this one. So this girl I'm dating tells me she's not looking for a relationship right now and we should be friends for now, because of school work and she recently got out of a bad relationship. And she tells me she needs some time on her own to figure things out. She goes into great detail and explains why she is feeling this way. So my initial thought was okay no problem, and I tell her I'll give her space and I am glad she brought this up before her and I were to continue. 

Then I go on reddit for some reason looking up what someone saying she is not looking for a relationship means (very bad idea). Apparently most people especially guys associate the not looking for a relationship sentence with her not being interested in me. I kinda got freaked out and bought into this despite my initial feelings of her sincerity. I ended up not contacting her for a while despite her never even denying me to spend time with her once. And I eventually started dated someone else not long after because I felt I was being played/a rebound for the previous girl. 

Not long after I started dating the new girl the previous one contacts me thanking me for my patience and being understanding about her situation, and that she is now in a good place to continue. So now I'm feeling really shitty because I really liked the first girl and have rarely ever met a girl that fit my personality as well as she does. So because of Reddit's a advice I am currently in a pretty shitty situation that is going to result in someone getting hurt by me :("

Their marriage was shit, she was lazy and racked up 45k of secret debt. He eventually divorced her, she took him for everything. He finally got out of that mess and kept talking to us about this friend of his from college, then sprang the news that he was going on a vacation with her, and oh yeah she's married. 

We are like wtf dude. And he's all she's unhappy anyway. So we do or normal ""if that's what you choose, but be careful"" speech. 

He completely cuts us out of his life, except fb, and find out via his status he's married to the married chick. Not really married, just a ceremony. And a huge diamond ring.

So her and her 14 year old son move in to his house, found all this out via fb. 

9 months later she's pregnant and moving back in with her actual husband.

Paul texted a few months back. We didn't respond."
"""Save"" is a very loaded term to use, because it implies that people that have sex before marriage have wasted or squandered something."

"I made an appointment at planned parenthood and when I showed up they gave me a big, scary packet, about what to expect. Mentioned fun things such as ""lemon sized blood clots."" 

I went into a room where the nurse went over pretty much everything from the packet. Made sure nobody was forcing me to be there. Then I watched a movie about the same information. 

Then they gave me a transvaginal ultrasound. They asked if I wanted to see the fetus on the monitor and I said no. Very glad I didn't. 

Then another person talked to me about what to expect and gave me the pill, which I took then. She gave me the second pill and a prescription for pain meds and told me to take them if I felt sick. 

I took them right away when I took the second pill and sat on the couch with a heating pad. I honestly felt fine. I bled, but nothing near lemon sized. For about five minutes I was incredibly nauseous and threw up, then felt fine. 

I went back a week later for a blood test to confirm I wasn't pregnant any more, which I wasn't. I was surprised it was far more emotionally difficult than I would have guessed, and far less physically taxing. 

Edit: I can't say enough nice things about the people at planned parenthood. Everyone was so kind and caring and treated me with respect at such a hard time in my life. Highly recommend. "
"There were like two months where the Marilyn Monroe quote was a thing, then like five years of people whining about it. Yes, it's stupid, but I think we've established that."
Ugh Emily is so terrible. I can barely watch the Emily episodes because I just want to yell at Ross through the tv and ask what the heck he sees in her. 
"Handing in my undergraduate thesis. I had to bring three print copies to the department after submitting a digital copy, and when I got there, no one was there. At all. I slid them into the secretary's mailbox and stood there a moment. It was the culmination of my degree and I didn't have anyone to tell at that moment, and I felt empty and flat, rather than excited and happy. "
God I would be so mad. The day is about the bride and groom. Don't take that away from them! Argh. I don't understand how people don't see it as rude.

"My kid wasn't a cute baby. I know it's practically illegal to say that as his mom, but he was not cute. But you hold your breath and you just hope it all evens out over time. And obviously, you never tell them. 

He started getting a little cuter around age 3. He's older now and he's not exactly a movie star or model, but he's cute in his own way, and he's *nice* and loves animals, and he's already got his first ""girlfriend"" and all that, so he's obviously not a lost cause. "
"Living in Denver, CO. He's a pretty successful graphic designer and artist. He absolutely loved to draw and paint. I am so proud and so happy for him. We were each other's first loves and I always encouraged him to pursue his talents. I'm glad that he is living his dream. I'm glad that we both broke up though in the end, I feel we both were just holding each other back. Now we are both pursuing wonderful career paths and have new, beautiful families but he taught me so much. I will never forget him. "

"Oh god, the ""civil debate"" bit. They'll be really condescending and insulting, but as soon as the other person objects or responds in kind even a little, it's suddenly ""why can't you be civil?"" I'm a mod of another sub on another account of mine. I constantly see exchanges where user A will be really rude and constantly putting user B down, often with outright name-calling. But as soon as person B says ""what you're arguing is racist/misogynist/nonsense/whatever, person A will start crying about how they're being attacked and person B is so uncivil and will often even report it to me as harassment as if I can't see the whole exchange. I can't even imagine what it must be like to deal with people like that in person. Gets really funny in cases where I am person B and people try to report me to... me. Like, they can see my name in the side-bar. How are they expecting that to go? "

"30 months ago, I was in stellar shape, had an amazing career that was well paid, lots of friends that I was seeing frequently and two cats I adopted from a refuge. Then, an aggressive breast cancer showed up. I lost my left breast, had to stop working and my running training, lost some friends and my two cats (they fell ill and died). After 18 months of fighting breast cancer, I went back to work and a few weeks in, my boss announced me that he was not giving me my job back because I was absent for 18 months. I was demoted to a job I hadn't occupy in 7 years with a drop in salary. 

So nowadays, I frequently ask myself what I'm doing with my life. It's like a forest fire wiped it all clear. "

2. Don't put all of your energy into making someone else happy. After some time you will realize you are no longer happy since you haven't focused on yourself. 
3. Relationships will never be perfect or a fairytale. You have to be willing to work on what is after the fairytale. 
4. Don't rush into marriage. You and your maturity will change a whole lot in your 20s.

"Ehhhhhh, I think the issue I find with it is really the smugness about how much 'better' they perceive themselves with money. If you have the money to spend, you're really not better for spending it on a vacation timeshare or games or whatever than a wedding. 

But really, the topic is what convo on reddit has been exhausted. This one definitely has been. And it's not like people saying that they loved their picnic wedding, it's people bashing others for not having a cheap wedding that's the issue. "

"Pampering or caring for themselves. It shouldn't be seen as a bad thing to take care of your skin, get pedicures and keep feet healthy, use good quality products, enjoy massages, baths, etc.

"I haven't experienced any cons at all. For me, switching to a menstrual cup has been amazingly easy. I empty the cup twice a day in the shower, have never had any leaks, have no more irritation (like from the dry tampons), and better understand my cycle by a lot (like how much is being expelled overall, etc.). I know the cup isn't for everyone, I sincerely wish I had made the switch years and years ago when I first considered it."
"I always did the ""right"", safe thing growing up through to now.  I worked hard in school, got into a good college, went after competitive jobs and internships, graduated from college and took a well-paying job, saved up a good chunk of change.... and in the process I never really stopped to evaluate why I was doing any of it other than ""because I should"".  I'm in my late 20s now, with a good job, good benefits, and in a good place financially, but lately I have been getting on myself for not taking more risks while I'm still young.  Lately I've been thinking about the fact I don't really know what I plan to do next, but I know that the conventional 9 to 5 life is really starting to chafe, and I can't fathom just continuing doing the ""safe"" thing until I retire.  I've saved up the money to go to gradschool loan-free, now, but I have no idea what I'd even study at this point.  

So, yes, holy shit, what am I doing with my life!?"

"One of my high school friends was dating my roommate for about five years after we graduated. She had broken up with him a few times but eventually he'd had enough and broke up with her.

She lied to her family saying he'd cheated on her (never happened) and called him a few times saying because of him she was going to commit suicide. When I heard the last one I rushed to her house crying thinking she was serious and when I arrived she was confused at why I was making a big deal out of her threatening suicide. 

She became really attached to me because she could use seeing me as an excuse to be at his house. After a couple months I became sick of going out of my way to make her feel better about the breakup, while she would spend our time together telling me I was an uglier version of her and flat chested. I told her I needed a break and she became pissed off that no one ever invites her to stuff anymore. "

"I went on a blind date with this guy I met online. We were to meet at a restaurant downtown, about a 45 min drive for me. Parking was a nightmare and I ended up having to walk 3 blocks in heels and sweltering summer heat. Waited about 20 minutes at the bar before I called. He apologized, said parking was rough and he was right around the corner about to walk in. I order the cheapest drink on the menu at this point, a $20 cocktail. Finish that, call him and he sends me to VM. After 5 minutes I walk out and go back to my car. He calls and apologizes, says he's in there now, sends me a pic to prove it. I see the same people I was sitting with, I re park and pay the meter, walk back to the place. 

He had left already. Said I looked like the type of girl who had stood up countless men before, so he was just getting even with me. He had the nerve to ask for make up sex too. I blocked him from everything."
"I'm hairier - that's about it. I have a little more time and money on my hands, too. Otherwise, life carries on pretty much the same. Do you have any specific concerns or things you want to know?"
"I don't really run into it with a weekly consistency but it does happen fairly frequently.  I seem to at least every quarter find myself resending emails that were originally ignored where I had pointed out potential problems I saw.

Not at all. Most people saying that about themselves aren't actually nice and are the assholes they seem to be complaining about all the time. 
"Due to the recession, I spent my first 6 years of employment working as a Programmer Analyst, fixing and diagnosing bugs, rather than as an actual software developper.  I was the only one in my department who actually had a CS education.  Everybody was pretty good at writing some basic code, figuring out why this variable is set to that, etc.  But I often found myself helping my coworkers to write software in a way that makes sense.

But without fail, every single time review time came up, I'd get mediocre scores in areas like ""Coding skills"" and ""Project knowledge"" but perfect scores in areas like ""Teamwork"" and ""Documentation"".  It's not that my bosses didn't notice I was fixing everybody's code.  Like, somehow they figured I was fixing everybody else's code, and thoroughly explaining to customers and coworkers why they were wrong in really concise ways, not because I was knowledgeable about the software, or good at writing software, but just because I was so gosh darn good at people.

By the time I was able to escape that job, my salary was in the 3rd percentile for my job title, experience, and location."

The other day I saw a thread where the wife posted it asking for advice. They had been married for 12 years and she was having issues with getting her husband to put his clothes in the hamper instead of the floor. The top comment was saying that he doesn't respect her or her boundaries and it was time to re-evaluate whether or not their marriage should continue. Like what???

"I think it's all cultural. Something that's normal in one's culture can appear tacky in another. For instance, bridal showers aren't a thing in my culture and I find the concept tacky but whatever, I understand people from different culture do it. Fundraising / crowdfunding for your wedding too. Cash bar (just provide the beverages you can afford or invite the people you are able to host) and selling entrance tickets to your wedding too. Cutesy poems don't make any of that better.

The garter toss, especially associated with a money game, is one I find tacky regardless of culture. ""No bring, no ring"" is rude as fuck IMO.

In general, not a fan of how demanding and unaccomodating some couples can be of their guests - and/or the guests of the couple sometimes."

"Somewhat important. Being a super picky eater or having an immature palate is a deal breaker for me. I love being adventurous with food and trying new restaurants and recipes. However, dietary restrictions or allergies don't bother me too much. "
"I would not.  I could not marry someone without knowing that we were sexually compatible.  And just so we're clear, I also would not marry someone without living together first, because I would want to know we were compatible that way.  I would not marry someone who's family I had not met, or who I have not traveled with at least once.  Basically, before I marry someone, I need to know that all parts of our relationship are either great or that the compromise is not a dealbreaker.  

I also would not casually date someone who was waiting until marriage for sex.  I, personally, like to have sex in my romantic relationships.  If we are never going to get married, AND we're also not going to have sex, then there is little point in ""dating"" them.  I'd be friends with them, for sure, but would not let it go past that point.  

If religion is the reason for saving yourself, your best bet is to date people in your religion who hold your same values.  When religion dictates the decisions you make for your life, you need a life partner who also wants religion to dictate their life choices.  Any other choice will probably end in resentment and heartbreak.  "

"For me, around age 30, it was when I'd be kneeling down and suddenly couldn't get back up as easily as I once could.  Now several years later, it takes longer for small wounds to heal.  My hair is also becoming rougher in texture.  OMG I'm old."

"Personally I'm sick of the women focused subs jerking about how much they don't want kids, how much kids suck, why it's such a stupid idea to have kids, and how haaaard it is to be asked by your mother in law when you're having kids. 

We get it, you don't want kids. You're not morally superior. They're both valid life choices.  Respectfully let other people do what they want and move on.

And I'm a childless 35 year old who has been asked many times when I'm having kids, so it's not like I'm being personally defensive. I just think the haughtiness about choosing to be childless is baseless and disrespectful."
"I honestly think it has to do with my past. I have been raped twice, and conceptually, I don't feel comfortable sharing my orgasm with someone else. So I fully acknowledge that half of it is my fault."
"For me... how fucked up it would make me. I just had the simple pill type abortion, didn't want a baby and still don't feel any longing for one, but I suppressed my sadness over it for so long that eventually I exploded and now have an anxiety disorder. 

I wish I'd known it was ok to tell my mom (was 20, lived apart from her cos of uni and I just thought she would be disappointed) and I wish I'd known how heartbroken it made my boyfriend as well as me.

 I wish I'd known that I'd get a major infection and become hospitalised and have to relive it again by telling male doctors who just didn't really give a shit whilst sobbing that I had a termination so that's why something is up with my uterus.

But most of all. I wish I'd known that it was the right thing to do because me and my boyfriend are stronger than ever and I am about to get my bachelor's degree. It would of saved a lot of random crying, screaming and locking myself in the bathroom because I thought my life was never going to be better again. 

I'm pro choice and about as atheist as you can get, so nothing external influenced my decision. I'm jealous of people who can be like ""yup, ask me anything!"" about their abortion because tears still prick my eyes when I hear that word and it's been 2 years. I wonder why I reacted like this. "
"&gt; There's over an hour between the end of the ceremony and the beginning of the reception, and guests aren't allowed to hang out at either the ceremony site or the reception site during this time.

I went to one with *four* hours between ceremony and reception.  Granted, four is enough to rest in between or something.  I could have gone home, but I was already dressed/made-up for the event and out and felt awkward about sitting around at home until the reception (fortunately, I was at least local) so my SO and I just went to a theater to see Guardians of the Galaxy instead.  We still arrived to the reception a little early and just sat in the car and waited."

I don't know how it keeps happening- I'll think I've figured it out and then she pulls me back in. Logically I know I'm an adult, and that her opinion no longer matters, but in the back of my mind all I want is for her to be happy with my life. I don't even care if I'm happy with it. As long as everyone else is satisfied, I feel like I'd feel okay. But I'm so constantly afraid of hurting or upsetting the people I love that it kills me when I mess up (which I always do) and I'm constantly terrified I'll wake up and have nobody left. "

She fucked a guy outside in the bushes. Towards the end of the night she started throwing up all over the place. She was in bad shape and couldn't get on the hotel shuttle in time so WE (yes as in we the bride and groom) were forced to house her in our wedding suite. 

That's right, we spent our wedding night cleaning her up and making sure she didn't die. I'm still a little bitter maybe 😂"
"Relating to woman-related subjects and posts:

"My sister married her terminally ill boyfriend almost 9 years ago.  She wanted to marry him before he passed away (quickly from a brain tumour) because they always thought they had time to plan one but sadly ended up with two months if he wanted to walk on his own. 
Everyone pulled together to make it happen and part of it was a potluck supper. My sister's stipulation was that anyone wanting to come to the supper HAD to provide food- no one eats for free. The wedding was honestly a gift from the community to my sister and brother-in-law. It was done well in that everyone came together, not that it *looked* good. "
"He thinks I don't know that he forgets to buy me anything for my birthday/Christmas every time. A few weeks before my birthday I have to make a comment about how ""hey it's my birthday soon"" and he'll suddenly cancel plans the weekend before my birthday and go shopping that day. He also always buys the same thing - chocolate/candy (often his favourite variety) and a book. This year he forgot to buy me a card until a couple of days before when his mum called to say she'd just posted mine and he suddenly panicked. He bought a card for me while we were in the supermarket together... 

I don't mind - after all, it's only gifts - although I'd much rather he baked me a cake or cooked me a nice dinner than spent money on clearly thoughtless gifts, but he really thinks I don't notice how terrible he is at gift giving. He always acts like he planned all along to do it the last minute - really? You planned to shop two days before Christmas? Even though we had other plans? "
"Thanks. There's a quote that goes something like ""no woman wants an abortion like she wants a Ferrari or an icecream cone. A woman wants an abortion like an animal caught in a trap wants to gnaw off its own leg to escape."" And that is the exact truth of it. I felt cornered and trapped like something small and unintelligent. Had they not been available to me, I would have tried to self abort and very probably would have died.  Pro life people simply don't account for that level of terror and desperation.   

The closest I can come to describing that level of fear is imagining you have an aggressive  form of cancer and being told there are no legal treatments in the US. How many would go to other countries despite bad hygienic conditions. It sucks to compare pregnancy to cancer and I don't view babies as tumors or parasites but it's the *feeling* I'm trying to get across. The utter panic and desperation. "

It doesn't happen all the time. I know plenty  of dad's and single dad's and none of them have had anything like this happen to them ever. In fact it's the opposite, if anything, they get lots of positive attention and inclusion, and women swoon over them for being an attentive father. But according to redditors, it happens alllll the time. "

"I lived with a girl named Sara. She was awesome the first three weeks - we made dinner together, she was on top of her chores, and we just had a good time.


The fourth week Sara tried to kick my bedroom door down. I called one of my friends and told him to come over. I could hear her smashing plates in the kitchen. 


Friend came, Sara had left in the meantime. We sat down, I explained that there's something wrong with Sara. Then Sara came back home. This is when I found out that Sara was a drug addict, and she freaked out when she realised she wouldn't be able to get her fix after paying rent, so she flipped the fuck out. 


As we were talking (""I can't give you back your money, I already paid the landlord"") she took a glass and smashed it on the floor. Then she grabbed me and tried to punch me. The rest is a blur. Sara ended up with a busted lip, two black eyes and bruises everywhere. I was picking shards of glass out of my body for days afterward. I sent her away with only a toothbrush and a change of clothes. The rest of her stuff was on the curb the next day. Her facebook wall was all her going ""I'm going to break that b*tches legs"" and ""I'll fucking kill her."" Her sister even messaged me and accused me of stealing from Sara, as that was what she had told all her friends and family is what happened.



I still have a restraining order against Sara."
"Not at all. Works great, never a complaint from a visitor."
"The trouble with these people is that they can't handle being told the problem is with their premise, not their argument. When they say ""but I logicked you so good!!!"" and your response is ""sure you're logically consistent but I fundamentally dispute your premise"", they completely lose the plot because they can't control the dialogue anymore.

They read this as incivility."
"A: -says intolerant thing-

B: That was intolerant

A: EXCUSE THE fUCK OuttTA ME, were you just triggered, PC snowflaeke ?? You need a safe space to get away from the truth????k?? Typical leftist censorship smh! Free Spach MAGA

*You have been banned from Guess_Where*

A: Lol hyper sensotive PC cry babies can't handle us real winners"
Good relationship \&gt; single \&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt;\&gt; unhealthy relationship
"I still don't understand why Ross, the largest friend, doesn't simply eat the other five."
"My extreme inability to judge when people are being rude. I'm HYPER sensitive to when people aren't 100% completely considerate of other people. Drives me nuts. Lots of the time people aren't being rude, I'm just being overly sensitive."
"""I own my own house and have a decent salary""

It's not that it's in any way unattractive to have a mortgage or a decent job, it's that the fact the sentence is there suggests they think these are the things women want....and on that basis, I don't think we'd get along."
"I've never even met a fat person who actually wants to be fat or is proud of it. All the fat people I've ever met have really wanted to lose weight, but some have just found it too hard or haven't got the motivation. "
"Job hop.

Seriously, the best way to get paid more is to leave.  I know a lot of people that would rather have the comfort of working in the same place, with the same people, or have misplaced loyalty to their employer, and just collect their shitty 2% raises every year.  I know women that have been doing what I do for as long as I have and are making $30k less a year than I am.


Get out of your comfort zone and get rid of that misplaced ""loyalty"".  "
"This Paul got married at 18 to a 34 year-old woman. His parents was country-style loaded (read: Southern rich folks), supported the whole thing, paid for the wedding. 4 months later, she left him for another 20 year old man, after racking up a 30k credit card debt. He promptly moved back with his parents, gave up school and his internship at a law firm.

Kept telling me and my SO how he wished to have a relationship like ours, loving and supportive. Then proceeded to hit on me privately (told SO right away), we cut him off. He slandered us on social media. Other friends cut him off when they learned the truth.

Weeks later we learned that he's dating a 14 year-old girl, claiming that the younger deep end is better than the older. Both got into meth/coke, is now in rehab. He hit us up the other day, asking for money. We blocked his number.

What is the deal with Paul?"
Bullying and drama ! Like actual adults having high school level drama spats OVER Facebook etc.
"I can't stop laughing at Big Panty.

The Panty Council scheming in a semicircle in a darkened room atop thrones, muttering, ""the gusset... yes, push it further back... we can increase liner sales tenfold..."""
"Especially when the groom makes a whole show out of it, dude your grandparents are there, her grandparents are there, really not cute. I hate it, then he flings it at his group of single friends, the whole thing is gross."
"I mean, I don't do it without warning and permission. I'm not lady saliva fingers, here to violate your personal space. "
Lol are you going to tell him?
"I'm American but I live in Germany. A friend of mine is trying to get me to make the 9-hour plane trip back to attend her bachelorette party in the spring, but I'm not invited to the actual wedding.

Uh, how about no? "
"You ran into the corn field while being chased by a ghost?  Yeah, that is some straight up horror movie shit right there.  You are lucky to be alive."
"It's all about attitude and context. I don't find it tacky to be drunk in the wee hours of the morning when others are too, assuming you aren't an obnoxious jerk. Being drunk at 2 pm when everyone else is on their first beer, hitting on all the male guests and showing your underwear as I've seen at the last wedding I've attended is extra tacky."
"People who don't clean up after themselves, like their parents are still around to do it for them.

Was working at the reception for a company for a couple of weeks, and this scenario was so common I was baffled: person comes in behind the desk, says ""I'm just gonna borrow a pair of scissors,"" I go ""Sure, they're in the drawer"" and return to my stuff, the person leaves, and when I look up, the scissor drawer is open and the scissors are on top of the reception desk. This also happened with paper tape, parking permits, and other office supplies. Amazing how so many grown people can't put things back from where they took them."
"You're spot on. Every time a man starts to explain something to me on a date that I understand and I keep the conversation going with him he gets excited.  


Then if I talk about something in the same subject that they don't understand? Wow, I can see the shutters closing across their eyes. Suddenly they aren't interested. Won't answer, he'll start looking at his phone. 


I've started asking what they're interested in a few days before a date. And I'll research it. General knowledge, nothing huge. I want to be able to talk about what he likes right? I'll watch them and see if they get upset that I'm smart. "
I gusset was worth checking this thread then!
"I went to a wedding where the mother of the groom had on this super tight, super short, very cleavage-y white dress, and while we were waiting for the ceremony to begin, she kept getting up and just sort of walking around, standing at the front by the podium, etc. It was weird. "
My sister in law went to school with Demi Levato in Dallas. Said she was a total brat back then while she was on the Disney channel. 
"Just about all the ones about women who do, or do not, wear makeup. "
You'd get Snoop levels of high if you were to smoke me. 
"Yes, four, actually. Two apologies letters, two hello-how-are-yous. I met up with one for coffee (ex-fiancé), and sent fairly nice replies to everyone else. High school ex was the sweetest; he was worried about seeing me at our ten year class reunion.

My relationship goals after the second apology letter changed to: never stay with someone long enough that they need to send an apology letter later."
"and wildly not true. If you ever hear a dude say that, it's probably because HE'S a creep, and assumes other guys are the same as him or at least wants to tell himself so."
"My SIL had a ceremony like this. Their pastor went on about how the groom was the head of the household and would lead her through life and her duty was to take care of him. 

There was a nice bit about her virginity and how the wedding night would glorify God because she was pure.  So, so icky."
"TIL what a gusset is. 
FWIW mine is also always too far back. I think they just need to be longer. "
Because fuck that guy.
Or do the dollar dance. You pay a dollar and dance with the bride  if you're a guy or groom if you're a girl. Seen that a few times. 
"Oh Lord so many things. The number one thing I've learned about parenting is never say never. My mom even warned about it ahead of time.

I said I would work out and be healthy my entire pregnancy but a combination of things made that impossible and I gained 65lbs. I said I'd never be a stay at home mom and now I wouldn't have it any other way. I said I'd never bribe or yell but there are days I am l mentally drained. I said I'd never wipe something off my kid's face using spit on my finger yet we are walking into preschool with toothpaste on her cheek so here goes. The list goes on haha. "
"Can you tell me if you've asked ""What do you think?"" I hypothesized this'll make them shut up"
"That by 2020, 60% of the species on our planet may be gone. 

That if we continue treating the planet the way we are now in general, there won't be anything left but us, and even that will be short lived."
"This hasn't happened to me in the workplace. I'm quite highly regarded and my opinions are always considered, although I'm the only woman on the dev team. "
"I think that a lot of women in their 20s end up sleeping with men out of obligation, or it's hard to say ""no"", etc. and end up feeling regret after hooking up but have no one really to blame but themselves and the fact that they were never taught to be assertive in situations like that.  

BE ASSERTIVE.  Say no.  Don't just say no, get up and leave.  Don't feel guilty about getting up and leaving.  Forget about being polite, if you are uncomfortable, or things are progressing too quickly, JUST GO.  Demand they wear condoms every time.  Don't just trust them when they say they are clean.  I made so many terrible/risky choices when I was younger, and I was lucky enough to come out of it without any long lasting health issues.  But you never know, and trust me the stress of it all is not worth it.  No man is worth the couple hundred you'll have to drop getting an STD screen to have peace of mind, or if you end up testing positive for a high risk strain of HPV, and have an abnormal pap, and have to get a biopsy, or surgery, all the money, so much money.

"It's a step worse than 'annoying'. They often are aware they're annoying, and are doing it to bother you."
"Being called pet names while doing tech support is so frustrating, I'm good at my job dammit! Being a girl doesn't mean I must not know what I'm talking about! Stop talking down to me and let me help you!!"
Men would benefit from shaving their underarms. Deodorant just isn't as effective when there's a ton of hair and hair retains smell.
