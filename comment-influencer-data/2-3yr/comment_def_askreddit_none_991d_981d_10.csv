"I've eaten mushrooms a bunch of times. They call it tripping because it really feels like you are taking a trip away from yourself. In my experience, there is no tripping a little (think alcohol buzz or a little high on pot), you are either tripping or you're not. Once you are, get ready and enjoy the ride!

Your mind will race all over and you'll think of, and imagine things that never would've occurred to you. Things will ""make sense"" in a way that they never have before but you won't be able to remember them unfortunately. (I've tried writing on shrooms and come back to scribbles and incoherent babbling that was life changing when I wrote it, oh well)

Visuals:  You won't see random stuff that isn't there. No creatures or things. What does happen though is everything takes on a ""sheen"" like water. Patterns become very cool because they seem to move and shimmer.  Tile floors, carpets, tapestries can occupy you for quite a while. 

Do's:
•Have a friend with you or someone you can call. 
•Have some music available along with other activities (coloring, drawing, video games, instruments)
•Have a cozy safe place to go if you start to bug out. 
•Have comfy pillows and blankets around. 
•Smoke a lot of bud. 
•Have water or juice available. 

Don'ts:  
•Daytrip (too many people, def not good for your first time)
•Be around a lot of people. (It will just bug you out)
•Stare at yourself in the mirror. 
•Drive!!!
•Get too worked up. If you start getting whacky just remind yourself to chill the fuck out and try to relax. 
•Drink alcohol. They don't mix well and you'll probably puke.
•Go near any law enforcement type people or authority in general. They are very scary when tripping! 

Now I gtg find me some shrooms. I'm all worked up about it!!

Edit:  alright, the mob has spoken! Day tripping actually sounds pretty amazing from a lot of you. In my experience day tripping, there were too many people out and about for me to be comfortable. 

Edit2:  Just saw this posted and brought me right back. Saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/5k2ogg/fatboy_slim_weapon_of_choice_big_beatelectronica/?st=IX3FFDF8&amp;sh=785c4450)  first time tripping and lost my effing mind! 

Edit3:  Ok about the weed. If it's your first time tripping and you are not an adept smoker, lay off and letting the shrooms do their thing, seems to be the consensus. Weed definitely increases the visuals and can strengthen the trip. "
"Nah, he's def pot-sexual.  Close tho.  "
