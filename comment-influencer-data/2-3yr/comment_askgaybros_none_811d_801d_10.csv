Yes. It was nice knowing you.
"This is why you don't go a few months before having sex. Whether we like to admit it or not, sexual chemistry can make or break a relationship.

He showed me all the plaque build up on his teeth and wanted a kiss 🤢
this one time three years ago someone made brief eye contact with me hahaha^im^so^lonely
"No shit. But this thread is kind of useless, as trump himself said, his supporters will defend him even if he is caught beating a toddler to death with another toddler while dressed as hitler and chanting satanically in french. 

He'll keep doing stupid trump stuff then someone will make this thread again, everyone will be circlejerking each other(not literally unfortunately), his supporters will be at the bottom with red daggers in their names(hopefully) and this will go on and on..."

"Until he saw me turning into the neighborhood i lived in, followed me home, and got out of his car jerking his dick at me

Worst thing is, he's one of the main dudes on probably the most popular radio station in town, every time his goddamn voice comes on when I'm riding with someone I have to turn it off"
Not at all. Imagination and anticipation can be very exciting. 
"I think they're tacky as fuck.

Also, in my experience, the chance of someone having them increases exponentially the camper they are. 

As for why people get them, the people I've asked always give a ""this ones for me nan, this ones for me mum, this ones for me pet hamster"" reason. "
"I made myself a seafood salad, it was lovely too"
"Yeah, of course


EDIT: Good lord"
"I was 12 and watching porn with my neighbor (who was also twelve). Straight porn btw. He was jerking off but I was looking at his dick and I guess he noticed, because he then grabbed my hand and placed it on his dick. I came right then immediately just by holding it. This went on for a couple years but never went past just giving him a handjob. He told me to suck it a couple times but I was too nervous. He has a girlfriend now but with me the rest was history. 😉"

"Grunting in my ear when I'm on my stomach and a guy is banging me from behind. Also when I can really feel a guy's orgasm build up while his dick is in my mouth after a long sex session, him getting harder and harder, just aching to orgasm, and then the releasing grunt/moan while he shoots my mouth full of cum...that's just heavenly."
I just wanna get the dick in mi mouth so idc.
#If I say that you're hitting the spot you had better not stop doing exactly whatever the fuck you were just doing. 
"Boxer briefs, all the way!

Boxers look so unflattering, and theyre usually plaid or some other manky design. Briefs just remind me of childhood, but the tightness is nice. Thats why boxer briefs are such a good intersection, theyre tight, cover more than just his dick. You can get a nice view of his ass in them.

I like simple graphic designs too, like hawaii style florals or more simple lines and shapes and stuff. Any colour but white. "
"Until they shoved the dog off the couch. Didn't happen to me, but a friend of mine... almost 1 year in a relationship; his dog (an old maltese) wasn't feeling well and was being more needy and clingy than usual. His bf casually shoved the pooch off the couch because he was getting annoyed. They broke up.

EDIT: There's been a disturbing amount of people who don't think this was the least bit odd, so I'll try to explain why this act was a total deal breaker. Note that it won't have anything to do with the dog itself, or its health, or whether it was actually hurt or not, or whether dogs are sentient, or whether some people treat dogs better than they treat people, but it will only focus on the relationship and interaction between the person who shoved the dog and the dog's owner.

Dog owners, as any other pet owner, can form strong bonds with their dogs. Dogs especially have been humans companions since forever and, through selective breeding, have been tailored to our wants, needs and even emotions - so much so that they can [recognize human facial expressions](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/12/1/20150883). Some people own dogs purely for practical purposes and don't have strong attachments to them, and that's fine, but it's important to recognize just how strong of a bond it's possible to form with them.

So now you have my friend, who has had his maltese for almost half of his life, and he understandably loves her to bits. The dog is important to him, as is its happiness and wellbeing. This is the crucial part: the dog is important *to him*. And then you have his boyfriend, who is also important to him, act aggressively toward his dog completely needlessly.

At the very least, this is a sign of complete disrespect toward your partner: you act aggressively toward something/someone that is important to him. You may say 'it's just a dog', but to a person who's had the dog for almost half his life, it's not just a dog, it's a family member; you might as well shove his mother or sister, since the reaction you get is going to be very similar. 

Another option is that the boyfriend just doesn't get why the dog would be important to my friend, in which case it shows a complete lack of emotional empathy for his partner: an inability to put yourself in another person's state of mind and understand why someone would feel differently about something than the way you do. Both of these reasons are more than enough to end a relationship over in my opinion.

If you still don't get it even after reading all this, then I recommend you google 'sociopathic behavior' and read up on some of the symptoms (showing no regret for your actions and harming animals are symptoms, btw) and try to see if you recognize yourself in what's written, then seek therapy if you do.

"I think you should take a moment to breathe. You’re just 22, there’s so much more of life ahead of you. Throughout your post you’ve mentioned that your family won’t let you marry someone you like, so fuck them! That is not their decision to make. It’s so hard to make everyone happy, and it’s easy to forget about your own happiness.

We can make our own family too, you know? You should start looking into building your own independent life. Get a job, try to move out, meet the right people that like you and want you regardless of who you want to be with or who you like.

It can seem impossible now, but you can be happy, just make sure you find the right people to surround yourself with."

On my 19th birthday my best friend and I went to my local gay bar's drag night. She left early and I kept dancing. Ended up having my first kiss with this hot guy. When he found out it was my birthday he decided to tell me he was a drug addict and didn't want to take me home to see him and his friends getting high.

"Fuck it dude. Don't go. You your buddies go do something else. That ain't worth with. Nothing should be a division between friendship. Especially ones that care for you no matter the differences between sexuality. 


I would never tell my boys they can't go to something because they are straight. I'll tell them what is happening - but make the ultimate decision that you won't go and would rather chill with them.

"That said, it's probably smart to learn about the actual risks of BJs (i.e. other STDs) before plunging a stranger's dick into your mouth. "
"A lot of those guys are usually circuit boys. I've met a few and...well..they're the same guys who wear cut t-shirts with the sides exposed to show off their gym bodies, wear tight shorts, and big clunky Nikes with the tongue sticking out.

"Absolutely, if it was necesary(fortunately its not).  My career always comes first.  Being gay doesn't put food on the table."
I was pissed at the time but now I thank my lucky stars that I didn't loose my virginity in a crack house.
"We were watching Friends and he started going on a rant about ""how Jews were over represented in media"" and how much it bothered him. Byyyyeeeee "
I thought this was going to be something about drag queens from the title lol
"I said this before from another post somewhere else:


I known him when i was 11 (Lets call him B)he was the first friend i have ever made when i moved to mexico, we went to the same schools and lived in the same neighbourhood and he speeks english, he told me that he is bi when he was 14 at that time i wasnt sure about my sexuality so i did not pursue him.


When i was 16 i had my first boyfriend, i would have loved it if it was B but he had a girlfriend at the time, my ex started to be very abusive he forced me to no longer have communication with B or any other guys without his consent and when i was 18 he outed me to my family and got me to be kicked out of my house.


When i was kicked out all of my other friends turned me down and would not help me in any way except for B, B helped me by letting me stay at his house and helping me cope with my depression, he also took the time to train and helped me get back at my original weight and i love him beacuse he take the time to help others, sure his love for anime gets a little bit weird but he looks so cute when he talks to me about the show he just watched.


The first time we had sex was when it was my 20th birthday, my mom was working at the time and the rest of my family lives in the U.S.A so i thought i was going to be alone but then B called me and asked me to come to his house.


when i got there he got me a cake and got me some old gamecube games, later we were listening to music and he just laid on the couch and i laid on top of him, i thanked him for everything and i just put my hand under his shirt and i dont know if it was my drunken hornyness that did it but i stared to grind him and he grabed me and asked me if i wanted anything else, i didnt say a word and insted i started to grind him untill he took off my pants and we jerked each other off, sex with that day felt so right and better than any other person i had sex, i did hookup with other people before him but he makes me feel needed and special to the point that i don't want anyone else.



we talked about being official in the past but i got scared of the idea that he will change like my ex did and everything will go back the way it was, i knew he is not like that but in my mind i  felt that way sometimes.


It took a long time for me to give it a chance and on the day we became boyfriends we had sex and just out of the blue i said ""i love you"" and he looked at me and told me ""i love you too, i want to be with you."" and that's how we ended up being together. sometimes i wonder what i did to get a guy like that but i'm glad we are together.

"One of the realities of pulling the lever for a party is that you are endorsing the entire platform, and you need to own this. 

I have zero respect for gay Republicans.  I met a lot in my time in DC. A significant ""leg"" of the Republican stool makes the reversal of LGBT civil rights a major policy platform. If you are the stereotypical DC dwelling gay upper middle or upper class Republican, I don't care if you are primarily concerned with a slight drop in your marginal tax rate. I don't care that you see gay as a small part of your identity.

Does this really happen, or is this just a popular sjw trope?"
"One. My favorite thing is when you go up to your guy from behind or front. You go in for a kiss and put your hand down his pants to his limp dick and slowly feel it get hard. Ugh. That's seriously amazing.  

Two. Then you slowly move together wherever you go to start having sex. Kisses everywhere and you take each others clothes off and the first time of that session you touch naked bodies. 

Three.  The pulsing of his dick when he's cumming in your mouth. There reallly isn't anything else like it. It's so foreign and different than anything else that you would normally put in your mouth. Makes you wanna cum forever. 

"
Send him to me. Uncut dicks are my favourite.
"One time while weeks into traveling I was quite horny and on Grindr looking to break my dry spell; get hit up by an okay looking guy who is super hot to trot for my D.  He wants me to come over and fuck him raw and breed him.  We worked out that we're both negative (and I'm on PrEP) and after a few minutes deciding just how slutty I was gonna be, I decided to go for it.

10 minutes across town later, I knock on his shady apartment door.  He answers, totally bare-ass naked, clearly terrible hygiene, and about 50lbs more overweight than his photos.  And...he's just standing there jerking off, clearly super into the idea that I'd even think about coming over.  The whole scene was kind of pathetic if I'm honest: trashed apartment, tons of weed everywhere, and the dude reeked of desperation.  It was quite a sad state of affairs...but the things we'll do when horny!

The inner monolog that flashed across my little lizard brain in less than a second: ""Well, he's terribly unattractive and I'm not sure I'm into this.  But, meh, a nut is a nut and I'm already here, so let's do it!""  And I walked on in.

He shut the door and I sat down.  He stripped my clothes off and hungrily sucked my cock for about a minute to get me hard.  Then we stepped into his bedroom where I tried not to touch anything for fear of a staph infection.  He jumps on his bed and spreads his ass atop sheets that probably still haven't been washed, tells me to spit on it and get to work.  Less than two minutes later of moderately enthusiastic pounding, I unload about a week of cum into his ass.  Three seconds later the wave of NOPE hit me.  I ninja'd into his bathroom and rinsed off my junk.  Then I hastily get dressed while he's still basking in the glow of a filled hole.

As I'm leaving, he's all proud of himself and thanked me, saying ""I'm going to love feeling your cum inside me all day at work.""  And I peaced out with a loathsome shiver.

Needless to say, I had a long and strenuous shower immediately afterward but I'm not sure the shame will ever wash off.

1/10, would not repeat.  Definitely my sluttiest moment.

TL;DR: Guys do dumb shit when we're horny.  Not recommended."
What was your yearbook quote?
"Then it seems like this isn't really about the underwear. 

Edit: and that seems like a great birthday gift for a bf."
He doesn't like it when you push in but he wants to be raped? I suggest a good long conversation about what each of you wants and how that can fit together. But maybe it can't. Sometimes otherwise decent relationships end because of such issues.
I'm a native English speaker and I have no idea what this is suppose to mean.

"Until I realized he was a damn liar. Not even little lies to cover his faults. Lies about things that don't make no damn sense. ""Oh you went to that bar before it existed?"" ""You say you're a Daddy-Dom Trucker when you're 19, submissive, and ain't got a car?"" ""You don't smoke weed but your cum tastes like a Snoop Dogg concert?"" GTFO my face. Thank God I only fucked him 3 or 4 times. "

Mornings 
"I went to this weird free street puppet show in LA. Interesting mix of people. There was one guy wearing worker's overalls and you could tell he has never done hard labor. That might have been a deal breaker, but either I was thirsty or being more generous then usual. 
I started focusing in on him and he eventually moved closer to me. He sat in front of me next to his friend. This guy who was talking to the friend introduced himself and the cute guy pulled out a notebook and started writing. His friend then chimed in, ""oh yeah. He's taken a vow of silence."" I noped that real hard at that point."
"Lol, its not just the same gay dude, it is almost exactly the same, you have the macho idiot, good looking and sensitive, girl with big tits but decently smart, really blond girl who is supposed to be sweet but only because she is ignorant, a short girl who is always a little bit pissed, an older man or woman who is a parental figure, nerd who is really really nerdy looking, a normal looking dude who is a closeted geek.

Basically, the whole point of the show is to put stereotypical dramatic people in a confined space to stir up a lot of drama.

Maybe in the future they will throw in a masc guy who is closeted (which they already did in bb canada), but you will never see a normal gay dude... thats like putting in a normal straight dude. When you only have 16 spots for contestants, you are not going to waste a spot for a normal drama free contestant. "
"love guys in just boxer brief, or just a tshirt 😍"
The reason we're seeing more and more gay people is because coming out as gay isn't a death sentence anymore.

Im sorry. But on the other hand you don't have to waste any more time on a failing relationship 
"So, ""duly noted"" and ""I have been denied an open relationship"" are informing you that your relationship has been opened up. He made that decision without you. 

Tell him he can fuck whoever he wants to. Tell him to enjoy the gay baths. Tell him it is totally up to him where he puts his cock, tell him you are not denying him anything. Tell him  that you aren't his boyfriend or your opinions would matter, and decisions about sex would be shared. "
You are the one that asked. About gay stuff. On a gay subreddit.

"That'll be sure to change a bunch of minds and flip a bunch of votes in 2018 and again in 2020. Because we know how well Clinton referring to Trump supporters as ""Deplorables"" worked out for her. 

People like you, who can't see that there are real people out in the world who voted for Trump for a variety of reasons are why we lost in 2016, and likely why Republicans will win a supermajority in congress in 2018 and Trump's second term in 2020. I'm not saying I want it, I certainly don't, but we seriously need to take a long hard look at how we talk to each other or we're going to keep on losing over and over again. 

I would never tell somebody who voted for Trump because their hometown was destroyed by globalization that they were pieces of shit. They voted for the candidate who was concerned with bringing back industry which puts food on the table. Just because they have different concerns than you doesn't mean they are bad people. 

So in the future I might ask you to look into the Trump phenomenon before labeling everyone who did the same thing as you, i.e. vote for what they thought were their best interests, pieces of crap, think about it some more. "

As hot as those ""closeted straight boy"" fantasies SeanCody passes out are, the fact that he nonchalantly disregarded his girlfriend was a total dick move. I told him no thanks.

However, none of this applies to this baker because they didn't even get around to discussing the decorations. They were just flatly refused. 

On a more personal note, its funny how this is the one sin that makes you ""un-cake-worthy"". Every last customer that walks in that store has repeatedly broken some christian commandment. If you're really applying your religion to your cake making business in this fashion, then your customers should have to swear to a lot more than being heterosexuals. "

"No. Conservatives have been out to make life worse for LGBT people for all of my life from ignoring AIDS to HB2. At this very moment, they are cooking up bills to try to limit our rights. If you live your life benefiting from from all the progress that's been made despite the best efforts of conservatives to block it at every step and, at the same time, you support those conservatives who would roll back that progress if they could with your money and your votes, you have no right to demand that people be nice to you. 

For gay conservatives to be the targets of harsh criticism is the very definition of fairness. They are getting *exactly* what they deserve.  "

"This is not about a cake.

This case is about what constitutes a business and what rules a business should follow in order to serve the public.

"I would agree with you, but anyone who can listen to Trump and justify half of the things he is saying and not worry about the other half are very stupid indeed.  The man invited Russia to hack us. He sexually harassed women and talked about it on camera. He promised things that he has no intention of doing to one group of stupid Americans that he knows would fall for this bullshit and turns around to his corporate donors and tells them he won't actually do any of that. He has sold us out to big pharma and supports a repeal of a law that brings healthcare to millions of Americans. He says he supports marriage equality and then when he takes office won't even acknowledge our community. 

He is a con man. And people who get tricked by con men are stupid. I have no problem being polite about it to their faces, but when someone tells me they voted for Trump - I have no problem telling them they are dumb and they are the reason our country sucks. (Again, I am a little more polite about it than that, but generally speaking that's the message.)"

"I was dating this guy who come from a pretty well off family, who basically was still paying for a lot of his living expenses as he went through law school. He was pretty smart and interesting admittedly, and also pretty hot. But the longer I dated him the more I realized he was kind of a prick. It took me a while to realize how bad it was because he was incredibly nice to me personally, always complimenting me, treating me, buying me shit. Telling me how much he enjoyed being around me. However he seemed pretty rude and impatient when it came to anyone else (such as waiters or just making random comments about strangers or whatever) 

 I remember the moment it finally fully registered to me that he was definitely just an asshole and only nice to me because we were banging. A married couple I was friends with threw a little dinner party thing and my ex and I attended. It was super nice and chill. Had some drinks, my friend made a super good, homemade meal, and we played some games. Then on the drive home, my ex said very casually in an off-hand way, ""they seemed very nice, I didn't know you could still be happy when you're that fat"". I was floored and super, super pissed. She had just had us over, cooked us dinner and was (as she always is), extremely nice to him and went completely out of her way to talk to him and get to know him and the only thing he focused on was that fact that she is overweight. I held it all in until we got back, then told him off, more hardcore than I have ever done to anyone in my entire life, and then never spoke to him again. "

"i definitely wouldn't want to find out right before we had sex.  it should definitely be in a non-sexual setting long before we actually got sexual.  just because i think it would be really awkward if they told you right s you started taking off their pants,  and then you are in  position where you feel like if you stop then you are saying you have a problem with it or being transphobic and they might get their feelings hurt.   so definitely should tell before it gets in any way sexual."

"Mine was junior year of high school on a church youth group trip. Me and who was my best friend at the time were sharing a bed when he reached over and touched my dick. I was surprised but was instantly rock hard. He kept grabbing it through my undies and I said to reach down under them if he wanted. Well he clearly wanted to because he reached under and the feeling of his hand directly on my cock made me blow hard. As soon as I did he retracted his hand like it was on fire said he was just curious, rolled over and went to sleep. Keep in mind that we were sharing a room with two other guys so I had to get out of bed with my soaked underwear and go to the bathroom. Well apparently he was still curious because the next night he crawled under the covers and proceeded to suck my dick. I blew my load after like three head bobs because the first time my dick was ever touched by someone other than myself was the night before and so I wasn't prepared to be able to last. 

Needless to say this opened a sexual awakening both in general and to my curiousness because about a month after we got back from the trip I got my first girlfriend and within the month we were fucking like rabbits. My friend and I ended up hookup twice more, once I sucked him and the other we 69ed. We have grown apart since and I can't say for certain that this wasn't the reason but I'd like to believe that it wasn't. Either way he's the gayest person I now know which is good because he was always kind of confused about his sexuality.

Edit: I identify as hetero-romantically bi, so basically I like girls when it comes to romance and relationships but when it comes to sex anything goes"
