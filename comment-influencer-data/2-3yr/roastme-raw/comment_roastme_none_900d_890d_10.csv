0,"You look like the kind of guy who has a ""rare pepe"" folder filled with common pepes."
1,"Wow, 26 year old single Mormon. As an ex-Mormon, and based on your unfortunate looks and general lack of seemingly any decent qualities, I have a pretty good idea of your future:
Desperately trying to find someone to marry you so you can finally get your dick touched, desperation sets in. Finally, you find a homely, equally desperate, 30 year old Mormon divorcée. She already has her obligatory 5 Mormon kids, and has little interest in fucking you. On the rare occasion she does, she is openly unsatisfied. You have no experience. No clue what you're doing. You'll never live up to her ex's performance, and she lets you know. Her kids also resent you, and look forward to the weekends they can spend with their real father, and away from your sad, lifeless eyes and rants about ""cucks"" and ""MAGA!!!"" at the dinner table. 

The sexual frustration slowly builds, and finally you turn to porn. You love it, giving you an outlet to explore everything you've been taught to repress. It consumes you. You start paying for it, as Redtube is no longer enough. Spending more and more, it becomes impossible to hide from your wife. After weeks of fighting, she finally forces you to talk with the bishop. She tells some close friends. They tell their husbands. Soon, everyone in your ward whispers about you. Your wife either leaves you, or, perhaps even worse, stays with you in a loveless, trustless marriage for the next 30 years of your life. You eventually die, having had sex a grand total of perhaps 20 times, only leaving behind a wife who regretted being with you, a throng of step-kids who hate you, and family and now distant friends who are embarrassed by you. In your last minutes you reflect on your life. After reflecting on your lifetime of embarrassment and poor decision making, your final coherent thought is ""But her emails....."" It brings you little comfort as you fade, alone and naked, into the cold, black void that is death. "
2,"What's the difference between you and Obamacare?

You were easily replaced."
3,After seeing this even most conservatives would agree: abortion should be legal up to 312 months
4,Your mom had the opportunity to make America great again 26 years ago when she could've swallowed you.
5,"Your future, ironically, involves being cuckolded by your wife."
6,You look like a group of friends in a sitcom that never made it past the pilot episode.
7,"You look like the kind of guy who would ask, ""so what are we"" after the first date"
8,I see you're waiting under the stairs for the football team again.
9,The biggest bamboozle here is lordtuts thinking he's famous in 2017.
10,You look like the type of girl to go ask the mentally handicapped kid in high school to prom just so you can look kind and humble when in reality you're doing it just to boost your popularity rating. 
11,"He clings to her to keep from sinking in a sea of self loathing. While she is a four if the judges are feeling generous, he is a 2, and thus validation buoyancy is achieved. In the long term, she allows it because he at least has the sense not to draw on his face. 

Asian girlfriend and slovenly IT guy know their fate is sealed. They have the expression of the guests of honor at an arranged marriage. She sees a lifetime of disappointing sex, he sees a lifetime of disappointing dinners.


Some ghost hunters point out that there was a sixth member of their crew who tragically died in a case of auto erotic asphyxiation gone wrong. If you look closely, in the background you can see him."
12,"You look the same, but she chose him. I'd ask you to draw your own conclusions, but drawing doesn't seem to be your thing either. "
13,I thought this sub was for roasts not straight up murder.
14,I saw your wife's post about his miscarriage last year. Looks like you have a long history of not being able to follow through with things. 
15,It truly takes a special type of person to date a girl for a year as a young adult and SOMEHOW REMAIN A VIRGIN!?! WHAT?
16,Have you ever just felt like running?
17,Pence doesn't really like your kind does he? Shocking really
18,Too far 
19,"I'd make a joke about dropping the soap, but you clearly don't wash your face."
20,I'm going to go watch Requiem for a Dream so I can feel better after reading this. 
21,It looks like your hairdresser bamboozled you.
22,"You have an attitude that says, ""I'm bored, but also boring."""
23,"How many years were you held back?
"
24,"And then ""good team work"" after sex"
25,"You all look like a staged PSA from the mid 90's.  All that's missing is a black kid, or someone in a wheelchair."
26,You look like a stock photo found on Google images. 
27,"If you think *for a second* that your ex wasn't fucking that dude while you two were still together, than that wouldn't surprise me seeing who you voted for"
28,"TBH you've got more the ""amateur magician who rents himself out to children's parties so he can pull a penis out of a child's pants"" look more than anything."
29,his girfriend did
30,You look like you'd be really fucking annoying 
31,The only thing worse than making jokes about the brave and selfless men who protect our nation is your teeth.
32,"I bet she's a good instructor, guys in her class will not be distracted."
33,Her mouth was full at the time
34,"Pack it up boys and girls. dis niggah aint going to church ever again .#feels. grats on leaving the cult. ps you are now the moderator of r/exmormon
"
35,That's what the rain boots are for.
36,&gt; implying he ever gets married
37,Tfw you swipe left and then remember you're on Reddit.
38,The most culture you'll ever have is that yeast infection 
39,Your grasp on the needs of the American political system is that of your hat: ill fitting.
40,🔥🔥🔥
41,Does your grandmother know you stole her least favorite shawl?
42,I'm not at all surprised that his ex didnt let him hit for a year. What surprises me is that he hasn't raped anyone yet
43,"You're the guy, the guy behind the camera in those ""BBC Fucks My Wife"" videos."
44,I love how you tidied up your room and everything before shooting.
45,Well maybe he has a sister or something 
46,I'm guessing your boss is too scared to talk to you about your pore job performance.
47,Gotta get that 4.9 somehow.
48,"You're too sensitive, I'm sure everyone there thinks you're the bomb."
49,"Of course, the infamous bamboozler is a ginger"
50,"This guy looks like a first draft rejected muppet. I'll bet he has thought out, quasi intellectual explanations on why nothing will go his way, but in reality he's just the epitome of sucking mediocrity. "
51,"If I knew you looked like this before the bamboozle, I would have expected the bamboozle. Can't trust a ginger."
52,"Most girls under the staircase will go bareback, but not bared kneed  "
53,She's getting trump cared as we speak.

56,There's another one of you out there?  Fuck.
57,"You look the type of guy with rich parents who only has ""friends"" because you'll buy them stuff if they're nice to you"
58,"Judging by the fact that I don't recognize you and you don't even have modo on your computer, I'm guessing you're the worst kind of magic player- a mid level grinder who calls himself a pro so he can act really douchey and condescending to the noobs who don't know the metagame very well because they have jobs and families and have sex sometimes. "
59,"He looks like the guy that still dates 15 year old girls at 26. He walks around town with his skateboard while school is in, and hopes that if he buys underage kids beer they'll stick around, since all of the people he went to high school with grew up and did something with their lives. "
60,"Pepe the frog is an Internet sensation. Originally a few variations were circulated and people started to make their own changes with pepe doing a variety of endearing or disgusting things. More often than not Pepe images would be drawn to be wearing different outfits or showing different expressions.

As Pepe proliferated the search for rare or infrequently shared Pepes reached an all time high. Shortly after reaching this new peak the Rare Pepe market collapsed after an archive of hundreds of Pepes was dumped online.

Given Pepe's appeal and the untold variations created, images that break the monotony of smug Pepes and sad Pepes are still of high value. 🐸👌"
61,You probably use that safety pin to make sure you can still feel.

65,"Your parents will say they ""love"" and ""support"" you. But they will never tell you how much of a disappointment you are to them. They ask themselves, ""How is it possible we raised such a pathetic son that spends hours watching Japanese cartoons and then spends hundreds of dollars on his dumb card game that will never amount to anything."" 

Then they see your shitty desktop background and consider suffocating you with a pillow in your sleep just to end what should have ended 2 months into your mother's pregnancy."
