4,Damn with a face that anemic I'm surprised youre not IV-bound already
5,"You're one of the countless girls who spends ages trying to take the perfect selfie for r/RoastMe, convinced that she's the first ever person to be unroastable. You took this picture and thought, ""What could they possibly roast about this?"" The truth is that you're right. There's nothing to roast. You're unbelievably boring. There is nothing noteworthy or interesting about you. You'll probably grow up to lead a normal life with  normal, menial jobs that you'll keep you occupied until your retirement. Then you'll coast until you die in your 70s or 80s. If you died today, not much would change. All of these comments will just be lame, nitpicking criticisms of your weird, shitty face moles. I guarantee that there will be 30 more of you today and 30 more tomorrow. Your existence is a cliche. Enjoy today's attention. Hope you feel pretty."
6,All the other white girls are so jealous of you. You are your own dog filter
7,"On the bright side you'll look young when you're 30, if your heart doesn't give out by then. "

29,The only chemistry you guys share in that fraternity is combining gallium and yttrium.
30,"I gotta be honest here. You gotta dig down deep and stop licking ass and eating dick. Its going to be hard, like really hard as you're probably addicted to being a slut. But its not only your brain thats addicted, its also the stale cum in your vagina - so you're going to have to flush it out with water  and a douche. 

Seriously, every time you're thirsty - suck a lollipop or a Popsicle. Thats it. And every day before school or work - grab yourself, a dildo, or a vibrator on your way out the door. 

Throw on some turtlenecks and walk around the block in the morning, every morning, to get the guys uninterested and your self esteem down. 

The sooner you start the better it will be, and it will get easier - fast. Faster than you think so just work hard with no excuses through the shitty first week. If you don't then you're probably going to have a pretty shit life. Its up to you, and no one else.

46,"Your life is worth living,."
47,"I gotta be honest here. You gotta dig down deep and stop drinking water and eating rabbit food. Its going to be hard, like really hard as you're probably addicted to starving your body. But its not only your brain thats addicted, its also the bacteria in your gut - so you're going to have to wash it out with protein and fatty foods.


Seriously, every time you're thirsty - drink soda or soylent. Thats it. And every day before school or work - grab an enchilada, donut, or chocolate bar on your way out the door. 


Throw on some headphones and laze around the house in the morning, every morning, to get the fat building and your metabolism down.


The sooner you start the better it will be, and it will get easier - fast. Faster than you think so just work hard with no excuses through the shitty first week. If you don't then you're probably going to have a pretty shit life. Its up to you, and no one else. "

97,I doubt it.  He'll probably go straight from looking like a kid to looking 50.  
98,Future witness in a priest molestation trial
99,The only bandwagon that you're on is the one that drives through a crowd

103,Looks like your only friend is diabetes 
104,"You two look like the kind of assholes who bamboozle a subreddit.

Let's start with Yoga Pants on the right with his Pizza Hut stained cowlick. You look like you swallow Lucky Charms with chocolate milk and repeatedly binge the entire 3rd generation of My Little Pony for the nostalgia of the pathetic childhood you never grew out of. It's really the stupid-looking cartoon mascot ass lean you've got going on like you've got attitude. The only attitude you have is when you get grounded. Seriously, do you manspread like that all the time? Because that might be the reason you are single and still masturbating to Digimon porn. Your thigh gap is yet another unrealistic expectation of women's bodies and it backs up your puberty issues, too. You fold your arms like you desperately want to be called Daddy but your face screams power bottom. Can your shirt clarify if it wants to be a polo or a tee? Your frame is underweight and your neck is *still* too thin for it. Your head looks like your mom accidentally sat on it before the doctors could pull you through. Your forehead looks like Dr. Frankenstein made a second attempt. Your eyes are sunk in and full of lies, like all the times you reassured your parents that you don't tab between League of Legends and World of Warcraft. Are your knee caps made of golf balls? What do you drink at your parties, RedBull PBR cocktails or just plain nothing because you are still grinding? You're so white you skip Halloween and Thanksgiving and go straight to Christmas. I'd pin you somewhere between Hellman's and Great Value mayonnaise. You look like you collect your wank in a shoebox and are proud of it.

Alright, let's move on to mister Golf Tournament. Are you just as fashionably challenged as your fellow wii fit enthusiast? You look like you put your gym shorts on inside out, get that checked. You look like you speak in monotone. The problem with Gumby-legs here is that he was given more than one job: holding a piece of paper and remembering not to blink at a camera. I genuinely hope your wedding photo is exactly the same, no really, I'd find it endearing! You already dress like you want to retire. What today made you think ""White, grey, and maroon, but the worst arrangement possible?"" Your goddamn earlobes make a parabolic curve are you seriously this destined to live your life as a sad nerd? I can see that you manually resized your windows on your laptop, but don't lie to us; you did it to hide the fact that you do in fact know how to do it with the Windows key. I wouldn't be surprised if the hat was hiding a parasitic twin. At least your actual neckbeard friend takes care of his neckbeard. Where did you get $10,000 anyway? Did you both win it in a Minecraft YouTuber's contest by mistake? Are your eyes closed to shield your vision from the shame? And by the way, this subreddit is called roastme, not raastme. At least get out another piece of paper! I see your professor drew some pretty sweet mountains on the chalkboard. Does he join your Dungeons and Dragons sessions, too? There's a chair right next to you and of course you're the type not to just use it. You look like the supporting character to an annoying protagonist. Behold the entire roster of the local Circlejerk Club."

112,You look like an anime version of Caucasian people. 
113,Holy FUCK
114,Tim Kardashian. 
115,If I request a roast on /r/roastme it is my responsibility to take it. I'm not gonna berate people for having a little fun at my expense which I voluntarily put myself up to. That is the whole point of the sub anyways.

124,"One redeeming point you have is that it'll be easy for you to lose weight.

wash your face and you'll drop 10 pounds."
125,"Hey honeylove, I have a girl your age. I'm going to be a harsh mom  for a minute and you're going to think I'm a judgmental cheesy asshole. Because I fucking am right now. 

Please know several things:

Being a young lady-person is not about being either physically attractive or worthless. There are a lot of ""fat/ugly/dude"" insults here, and they do not dictate your worth. You have inherent value, just as much as the prettiest person you see. You're no doubt bright, you have your own interests, thoughts and personality. When you invite a roast, it should be in good fun. Commenters show their own worth, not yours. 

Whoever your guardian/s are, they are failing you utterly. I'm fucking mad at them, to be honest. I know most teenagers think their parents don't know what's best for them, but it's clear that yours do not. You no doubt know that it's not normal for adults to ignore their children's health, emotions and needs until their child has endangered themselves. 

At your age, your health is a symptom of your home environment.  You are not broken or permanently stuck. You have been trained to fill your life with food where necessities such as mental, physical, emotional connections are neglected. Some parents give their kids a snack and screen to keep them busy when they are unable for whatever reason to do something active with them. Once you start filling your time with things that interest you, you will not even have time to be preoccupied with food.

You are as young as you will ever be. At 13, 16, 19, 25 none of us could accurately imagine being different in a few years time. If you start this minute telling yourself to eat something healthier, take a short walk during a depressing night, walk the stairs a few times every day, talk to someone new and learn something new -and actually getting up and doing it instead of later- you can be thinking, feeling and living much better. 

You deserve to be healthy, happy and yourself. You deserve friends and role models who care about *your* emotional, physical and mental needs. Cutting people out of your life can be difficult, as can bringing new people in when you are feeling unworthy of even your own positive attention. It is absolutely worth it. When you get rid of selfish people who do not care about your needs as much as their own, the relief is unbelievable. You are responsible only for your own behaviour. Do not ever feel obligated to keep people who do not improve you.

This will be your past no matter what you choose to do. This will be your future if you choose to keep procrastinating. In two years you will legally be an adult. If your home situation is making you hate life, work toward being an adult you can respect. You have two years to build friendships, support systems, skills and goals that will leave you free to be what you want, then the rest of your life. You can leave this version of yourself behind if you want.

 When an able-bodied young person stops caring for their body, there is something off mentally, emotionally, and now physically. 
I do not hate overweight people, nor do I think they're broken. But this girl's guardians have utterly failed to provide healthy outlets for her. If any of my young people were inactive, alone, online and eating the majority of their spare time, I would be neglectful at best and abusive at worst to let that go on. 
I hope she sees that she does not have to be alone, depressed, and surrounded by people who aid her in destroying herself."

221,You‚Äôre a prime example of why you should never nuke a country twice. 
222,"Ok, story time.  I'm a 50 year old white guy, married, and we have two young daughters.  I'm not a fine physical specimen, but I'm within 20 pounds of my ideal weight.  I've never had any weight issues.  I have 6 siblings who also have never had any weight issues.  Our mom always made balanced meals, we snacked (popcorn, chips, ice cream, whatever), but never overdid it.  I honestly never understood how people got so fat.

About 10 years ago, my wife and I considered adopting or fostering, so we took classes that were required by the county.  There was about eight couples in the class.  The couple at the table across from us, who were in my line of sight all day, were fairly young, maybe early-30's, and they were both obese.  I would say morbidly, but I'm no expert.  I'm not exaggerating when I say these two people never stopped eating.  They came into class in the morning with fast food, huge meals with extra large sodas, and a backpack full of junk food.  Once they got done with their breakfast, they would immediately crack open the backpack and pull out candy (starburst, m&amp;m, chips, etc.).  They would eat junk non-stop until lunch. We had an hour for lunch, and they would always come back to class with more fast food. They were gone for an hour, so I assume the food they brought back was second lunch.  They would eat that food then dive back into their backpack until the end of the class.  I watched this for four days straight.

Your sex life will be average: punctuated by the occasional pair of Mildly racey knickers, once-a-year bathtub fuck sessions, and a sexual repertoire of predominately cowgirl and exceedingly long and unpassionate blow jobs.

In therapy now, and going on 4 months without a binge and making a regular habit of exercise (on my way to the gym now!). I don't know if I've lost weight because I am not allowed to weigh myself.  I'm trying to gain a sense of worth divorced from a number.  It's slower, but seems to be working.

They eat crap, their blood sugar goes up, they dump a lot of insulin, and the blood sugar gets hoovered up and stored as fat, and they feel hungry again because their blood sugar is too low.

It's a viscious up and down cycle and the only two constants are hunger and an ever increasing store of fat.

They need to change what they eat, and cut out the sugars. Exercise helps but not that much. You can't outrun a dietary problem. "

/u/1LWag1 please listen to this person.  I was the male version of you when I was 16 - 350 pounds.  I was drinking multiple 24 packs a week - usually 4-6/week.  I did that for 7 years.  I'm now 31 and weigh ~~615~~ 607 pounds(Decided to weigh myself while looking for typos).  I was heavier, but losing weight is fucking hard.  One of my best friends in the world was ""chubby"" but I wouldn't call him fat, and he got into health and exercise after high school.  He's super fit now and I'm 100% mad at myself that I didn't follow his advice and his suggestions.  /u/brakamow is one of the kindest and caring souls I've seen, and I'm in awe of what he's done every time i hang out with him.

Anyway, it sucks getting this fat.  Don't let it happen to you, seriously - you have time after school.  Join a school sport, ask if you can lift and exercise with one of the teams if that'll keep you motivated.  See if you can join ROTC.  I promise, promise promise you'll thank yourself in later years.  "

355,"The real tragedy here is that OP is 16. You never even had a chance if you were raised to this level of obesity. It must have taken years for you to get to this point. If I had to take a guess, you've been fat your whole life. 

That isn't your fault. Being healthy is something you must learn to do. How can any kid know better than what their parents tell them/give them to eat? 

You've probably known for a few now though that there is a problem with your health. But how do you change it? You're likely limited to what your parents buy and if your family eats together, changing your diet could mean changing your time spent with them. 

This wasn't your fault and you're in a tough place to change it. I hope you do find the strength and determination to get through things. It's amazing what even just kicking the sugar will do for your body. You could be a whole new person by the time you turn 18. Wouldn't it be great to show up to college and be attractive? To get to go to a party, have a guy hit on you and it NOT be a dare? 

Wouldn't it be nice to not hate life, but instead take control of it and be proud of who you are and how you look? 

So you can keep wallowing in your self pity and making excuses. Or you can realize that, for probably the first time in your life, you can DO something about it. Everything changes once your attitude changes. "

For me, keto is better but that is just my opinion."
