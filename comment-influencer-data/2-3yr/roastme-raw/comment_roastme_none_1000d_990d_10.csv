Soon that attention will be the only thing that will get you out of bed in the morning. You will find yourself not giving schooling enough attention instead opting to party and have fun. Eventually you will end up with a minimum wage job and probably pregant at a very early age wondering why life sucks. You will probably end up dying from breast cancer because you couldn't afford health insurance and die at a young age. Statistically speaking you don't stand a chance.

But she didn't want her summers to end, so she got herself a fake I.D. and a push-up bra and started hanging out at the local bars. Right. Developed a nasty coke habit, 'cause she loved the way it made her feel. Mm-hmm. Extreme highs gave way to extreme lows and she fell into a depression. Had herself a kid. Thought it would give her a sense of purpose. And it did, for a while, until she started using again. Mm-hmm. And then social services came knocking at the door, and now the kid lives upstate with his grandparents, 'cause she can't take care of this kid. And here she is festering away in a one-bedroom apartment waiting for the HIV to turn into AIDS. And wondering what the hell..."
