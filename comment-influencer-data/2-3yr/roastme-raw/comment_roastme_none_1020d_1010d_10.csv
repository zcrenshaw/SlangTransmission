0,Your Steven Tyler cosplay is on point
1,If date rape was a fuckin person.
2,"President of the single women's book club maybe
"
3,I guess your radio station doesn't play soul music.
4,I'm guessing you're the one with cold feet since all your fiances  wore Jordans to the wedding
5,"When your mom told you she wished you were a Miss, she really meant Misscarriage."
6,"""Hey I found a picture of a wife beater."" 

""Yeah, but what's he wearing?"""
7,"No forehead jokes, really? I mean, it doesn't even fit in the photo..."
8,He was the successful recipient from an eye donor?
9,"you look like a chipmunk with down syndrome

"
10,I don't know why everyone is being so mean. I think you're Precious.
11,You look like you fix potholes on Fury Road
12,That phone looks older than your boyfriend
13,"Roses are red

Violets are blue

Your head is empty

Your bra is, too"
14,He chose to cosplay your hairline and slowly recede from your life. 
15,You look like every defense against the dark arts teacher merged into one
16,"Just FYI, being bought by a 55 year old Saudi man doesn't count as being engaged."
17,Because he wanted a one-penis relationship
18,Do you dream in Imax?
19,  #ImWithHurr
20,""".. and actually do your worst this time!""
I assume you tell your hairdresser the same every time you go."
21,"You look like the stripper that dudes can't figure out why you're stripping, until you strip and they see that your asshole looks like a balloon knot."
22,"By the time you make it to 35, you're more likely to be thinking about running from your problems. "
23,"Is that a Bridge stamp on your wrist? If it is do you go ironically or because you actually think Bridge is cool? You probably pretend to enjoy Cellar every week, whilst regretting every moment of your time there.

You look like you don't enjoy actually going out but only do so to 'network' in the smoking area. This is in the hope that when every one else has got their internships, spring weeks etc you can get by with your 'contacts' and 'friends'.

You look like you go to on of the colleges that claim to be near the center of Oxford, neglecting to mention that the center is all the other colleges. You claim to have a history but the truth is that they all look the same, are a bit boring and are very insular.

Then there is your degree. Yes it hard to get into. No you don't actually gain anything from it. You've got in, its probably your peak in life. You'll graduate with an average 2.1, nothing special on your CV, some vague 'friends' from all the hacking you do but ultimately look the same as everyone else on your course. You'll go and work in the City, have a mild drugs and booze problem, end up divorced, friendless and burnt out by the time you are 50.

Overall you are the human equivalent of the Purple Turtle. People know you exist, they might even go there occasionally, but no one loves it, its no one's favorite and is ultimately pretty shit. "
24,You're like the great value version of Kim K.
25,"You know, I've never been a fan of landing strips on pussies"

29,Her face tells that's the only hole you know how to finger.
30,"I hope you're bisexual.

You're going to need all the chances you can get."
31,Fake post. Not even a mother who hates her daughter would name her Ross.
32,"You look like a guy that would try to walk on at a D1 college football team, not make the cut, and then talk about how you played college football for the next 10 years. "
33,"Well, if it makes you feel better he's *probably* been done with you for months and you only found out on your anniversary. The fact that he waited until your anniversary to tell you means he's *probably* a fan of symmetry, and looking at your face, that's *probably* a big reason why he dumped you. 

Or you're *probably* just a bit of a cunt."
34,Your head looks like an octagon with a comb-over. 
35,"If your piercings are properly aligned during the solstice, does your head open up to reveal the Ark of the Covenant?"
36,I think I saw this pic on the cover of my company anti-discrimination policy book
37,Being trans would at least make you interesting.
38,Is the radio your only legal way to speak with kids?
39,You're the only top heavy girl I've ever seen with small boobs
40,"Wow, less attractive than Hilary and same result."
41,You should already know people are mean. You've clearly had three different people propose as a joke.
42,Typical Asian girl with no boobs
43,"I'd say you look like Kevin Hart, but it's more like Kevin Hartfailure. 

Edit: wow my highest rated comment is a very bad insult"
44,tbf I'm sick of roasting all these basic bitches
45,"Don't lie, you're not at a radio station, you're locked in the closet with all of the other useless junk your family doesn't want. 
"
46,"Jowels at 16, looks like you'll be the first female president to be inaugurated while riding a mobility scooter."
47,"[Here's a better picture of you](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fcdni.condenast.co.uk%2F426x639%2Fg_j%2Fgjones_gl_29jun12_rexfeatures_b_426x639_1.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.houseandgarden.co.uk%2Fbeauty%2Fhair%2Ficonic-hairstyles--most-classic-hair-dos-all-time%2Fgrace-jones&amp;docid=D3WB_xx0sHUjiM&amp;tbnid=9yAjgN4jcrx5PM%3A&amp;vet=1&amp;w=426&amp;h=639&amp;client=ms-android-hms-tmobile-us&amp;bih=615&amp;biw=360&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDwLfg08DQAhWDRSYKHV72CVMQMwggKAUwBQ&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8)

49,I swear to god I can't tell if this is a woman or a man
50,if fury road was a gay porno
51,"&gt;  my sister advised me not to post this

Looks like she got the brains, and by process of elimination also the looks"
52,For a second I thought this was a mug shot. 
53,"You two will bang once, lose touch and marry other people.  Then in the most pathetic circumstance,  a suburban Starbucks bathroom, you two, now both 40 pounds overweight will bump uglies,  ruin eachother marriages and move into a one bedroom apartment together furnished with defective ikea furniture. There you will live. Watching daytime tv and giving eachother insulin shots until you eventually die in a colliers mansion type fire started by a microwave burrito. "
54,Didn't your ass already get roasted in Fast and Furious Tokyo Drift?
55,"Having to use paint to write ""roast me"" because your fingers are too fat to type singular letters"
56,You look like a real life bad guy from a mid 90's beat 'em up video game. 
57,Of course the asian guy has the smallest banana
58,It looks like she's suffering from male pattern baldness.
59,I found that baribie doll my dog used to chew on.
60,"Let's find the most useless thing in the picture. 

HINT: It's blue"
61,"Jesus, don't you look in the mirror and think ""At my age, I look like a fucking tool with this haircut"" "
62,I think we're the ones suffering from it 
63,"&gt;I'm Quincey And I'm running for president in 2036

That's great, honey.  And yes, my order is correct on the screen.  "

75,BUCKLE UP BUCKAROOS 
76,"I'd hit you, but your Dad would probably sue me."
77,The Purge is a movie not a diet plan. 
78,"This was the comment I was looking for. 

There's a reason his friends call him ""Special K"""
79,Hit you with something new? How about a bar of soap and a paycheck? It looks like that would be very new to you.
80,Oh great now the White House will have a cat problem. 
81,"You look like the type of guy who would raise the price of drugs for terminally ill children 5,000%"
82,I think he would have to be a woman to fill that role...
83,Kirkland Kim?
84,Gucci uses the bags under her eyes as inspiration for his next spring line. 
85,This is why community college shouldn't be free
86,You've been roasted a few too many times.
87,You guys look like a couple that would do fake incest porn on the internet 
88,Best roast here. The rest are horribly executed racist jokes.
89,You look like the lesbian hipster version of Alvin. Who knew that cartoon chipmunk could be more annoying. 
90,You look like you bring doughnuts to work just so people make eye contact with you. 
91,"That depends; are you post-op, or pre-op?"
92,"You know, eating disorders went out of fashion in the 90s. "
93,Your your hair looks like a tasered dog.
94,"In other words, a chipmunk with down syndrome."

Your body's flatter than the side of a washing machine."
96,"I'm thinking your dad is the one having the issues:  disappointment, shame, grief..."
97,You look like you wake up out of breath. You went to the doctor and your blood pressure was 120 over gravy. Your blood type is Creme Filling.
98,The camera put the band aid on itself so it didn't have to watch. It's all it could find. 
99,You look just like Kim K . . .by that I mean a washed up whore who's only talent is taking dick and taking pics.
100,"You're the kind of girl who's convinced she's very attractive but still smears herself in makeup to hide all the flaws she thinks are obvious. You're the worst mix of incredibly confident and fingers-down-your-throat insecure, but between puking up carrot sticks and smearing yourself in makeup until you look like a genetic experiment gone wrong, you forgot to develop an actual personality. That means that, while men may occasionally come knocking - even if they can stand putting up with the rank odour of heavy makeup and faint vomit - they soon leave when they discover they may as well be talking to a badly painted wall."
101,"It would be better if you were trans. She convinced you to let her 'make you up' and then convinced you to post this photo on r/roastme. Dude, you're not getting any. "
102,I thought 0 multiplied by 2 is still 0.
103,Ya'll look like that weird lesbian couple in high school that one try to hide the relationship while the other all ways talks about it.

105,Hilarious B.I.G.

110,"""Here at sunshine orphanage, we value diversity!"""
111,It's nice to be reminded that all races have losers and undesirables.
112,"True. She looks exactly like the last 50, same oversized eyebrows, same dead but attention-seeking gaze, same attempt to distract with cleavage. I guarantee she has the same stupid Han Solo vest, yoga pants, and tasseled boots as all the rest. We should just link this basic clone to the hundreds of dull roasts of exactly identical women."
113,she also secretly hates you and she just proved that to you 
114,After some detailed forensic analysis I've concluded with 100% accuracy that this image has been digitally altered to remove a pocket protector from the left shirt pocket.
115,Football practice ended hours ago you can take your shoulder pads off
116,You can never catch them all when playing Pokémon because you get stuck when the Professor asks you if you're a boy or a girl.
117,Where is this Ross you speak of ? All I see is a Sally.
118,It didn't contribute anything to the roast.
119,RemindMe! 20 years
120,"I won't go after the hair. Not because you asked me too, but because it looks lank and matted, like it was stolen from a decomposed horse and I don't really want to roast a horse. It frames your androgynous face like pubic hair frames a testicle. I don't mean androgynous in a good way either - you have just enough masculine and feminine features to make you equally unattractive to either gender."
121,"I literally can't tell if you're a weird 20 something who looks like shit and does all the drugs, or a weird 40 something who never grew out of their rebellious, unhygienic awkward phase. "
122,That's the best cosplay of Gary Oldmans hair from The Fifth Element I have ever seen.
123,yeah but then he just smokes more meth and feels 19 again
124,Probably a bit of both.
125,I could fly to Hawaii and then to Japan by the time you finish getting ready in the morning. 
126,"Post op, but the hormone therapy isn't going as well as planned :/"
127,I think the validation you're looking for will best be found on r/gonewild.

130,"N.W.A.

Nerds with Aspergers "
131,The only two women Bill has said no to
132,"Yeah, I could see you in retail management. "
133,You're like the slenderman of Chernobyl 
134,"Either way, it eats a ton more chicken sandwiches than it makes."
135,Nothing makes me want to discriminate more than seeing the ugliest people of each race represented. 
136,You forgot to wash the stamp on your wrist to the gay nightclub you went to last year
137,Which belt does dad whip you with when you tell him you're still not a doctor?
138,Your smile is as unconvincing as your need for a bra

149,"I know it nags at you.  This vague sense that something isn't quite right, but you can't quite articulate it. 

Those moments where you're in a car with a guy, and you're chatting away, and you can sense his participation in the conversation is forced, almost phony.

Or when he looks at his phone and chuckles, and you ask what's funny and he just sort of shrugs, but doesn't really answer.  Part of you wishes it was another girl, but it's not-  he just doesn't want to have to explain what's funny, to actually have to engage with you.

Because, at the end of the day, the truth is exactly what you fear:  You are nothing but a series of reasonably pleasant looking holes, and every man who you've been with or will be with is perpetuating an act to continue to have access to those holes.  But, someday, they'll want an actual person and not a blow up doll that requires maintenance. 

So start reading up on sex tricks in Cosmo- that way you can stretch out your artificial relationships an extra week or two."

183,"That is the dumbest looking haircut.  No joke.  There is nothing to be proud of there, and this is coming from a bald man.  Invest a bit more money and get someone other than your mom to cut your hair"
184,"I guess it's ""Bring your house to work"" day."
185,Jesus.
186,You again???  There are *still* bigger pineapples on your blouse than you've got on your chest.   
187,"This is the stupidest fucking title I've ever seen here. As if I needed any more reason other than your pic, which I'm sure took you somewhere near 50 tries to ""perfect"", to be 100% convinced you're a total goddamn retard."
