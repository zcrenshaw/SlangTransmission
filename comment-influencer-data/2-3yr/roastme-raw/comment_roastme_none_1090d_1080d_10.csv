2,"Results of your date: persuasion check -1, roll d20, 1.  Persuasion 0, you try to make a move and he learns that he's gay."
3,Welcome to Earth. 
4,"The various forms of English you speak depending on how tight your braces are are not ""multiple languages""."
5,This is the real life equivalent of r/iamverysmart 
6,You spelled cholesterol wrong. 
7,I didn't know Air Force has a League of Legends team.

15,You look like Bert from the Middle Eastern version of Sesame Street.
16,"Too lazy to flip a photo, but 4 hours to make sure you look as unique as an extra in an AFI video. You lie as well as you groom your eyebrows. "

22,"If Bruno Mars and Jean Ralphio had a baby, you'd molest that baby."

&gt;the Star Wars T-shirt 

&gt;I like ""youtube"", ""poetry"" and ""satire"" xDD    

&gt;""LOL I'm so shyyy guiz :33""    

I can't describe the amount of cancer your post gave me.    

Some day you'll grow out of this ""I'm such a geek for liking videogames everyone plays and movies everyone watches"" embarrassing attentionwhore-phase and realize just what a cringeworthy walking stereotype you were during this phase in your life.     

That being said, congrats on your good grades. It's not often I find a """"""omg I'm sucha geek xDDD"""""" person, who's actually smart. Usually you people are beyond retarded."

30,"* Interesting that there's an entire box of books there that, due to your inability to mirror an image, you're definitely far too stupid to read.  
* Cards Against Humanity in the back? I'm sure the creators would think about renaming it if they saw what kind of drain on society and humanity as a whole put their game on their nightstand.  
* They say those chokers are the black belt of sucking dick, but something tells me you don't have the kind of long-term mindset of getting a black belt in anything, I really doubt you're used to anything lasting more than 15 minutes one night.  
* The eyebrow piercings are interesting, it's like a highlighter swipe showcasing the fucking Sharpie job you did yourself in your friend's dirty spotted bathroom mirror since your step-dad doesn't let you have the bathroom to yourself long enough to scribble those on over your eyes while you try not to shake too much from the emotional distress of having to fucking live with yourself for another day.  
* Oh good, small lobe stretches, because you wanna be different from girls who have just pierced ears but, like, not really.
* Your eyeliner is just as creative and well formulated as your shitty faded hair dye, I bet you'd be a huge hit at a sixth grade dance if you managed to blow all the security guards in time to get into a kid's event. I'm sure you won't have trouble with that, though, since...  
* Sweet fucked teeth there, how many bouncers and anonymous partygoers in an abandoned bedroom had to blindly plow your mouth (in a pitch black room so they don't have to look down at just another scene girl reject in denial, mind you) to get those bad boys? Or did you lose track by your 14th birthday?  
**EDIT: this is the end of the comment, the part that says** *permalink embed save report give gold reply* **is NOT, in fact, part of a roast you asked for. Figured I would have to clarify for you, girl who probably has a common noun for a name since her teenage mother couldn't think of anything better between white lines and black cocks**

41,"Just cause granddad was a kamikaze pilot doesn't mean you have to be one too.
"
42,"Look at me! I'm so unique, I do quirky things and I'm such a closet narcissist that I actually had to put my talents in my heading on the thread before I got roasted. You probably say that header line to people as soon as you meet them so they don't instantly walk away from you. Too bad people can't see inner beauty eh?"

71,"First person I've seen that has one eye intrigued and the other eye sleepy. Your face is stuck on ""about to sneeze""."
72,"Your hair says ""I'm the young, cool mom."" But your face says ""I just drank an entire box of wine and pleasured myself to Dancing with the Stars."""
73,"You have lovely eyes, trouble is theyre so far apart I can only stare into one at one time."
74,"Ultimately, you appear perfectly fine, its difficult to really find much fault. 

Really Nothing to write home about, nothing to get excited about, nothing to be ashamed about. 

You will likely make a guy pretty happy some day and the two of you will be married - you will probably find happiness for the first eight years - have the standard two children - then realize that you don't love him any more, and after more introspection that you never really did. 

You will divorce this man and take your two children, certain that you have as much to offer the dating worlad as the day you posted to Reddit back in 2016. You will look to reenter the world of dating but by then you will no longer be the standard acceptable girl you once were because time takes beauty from all and only the truly exceptional are spared the viciousness of time's brutality.

Really though, you look fine now and you should be happy about your current situation as many people are not as fortunate as your currently are. Yes, you will probably end up loveless, unhealthy, and unhappy but that is just the hand you were dealt so live it up now."

And then you bragging about how much of a nerd you are... this is bait and I'm not biting. You still aren't sure about who you really are, and it's sad. I can see the pain through your stupid fucking glasses. You're so hollow and empty. Trying your hardest to fit in, somewhere. -anywhere. And still, wanting validation that you are in fact a nerd, cause if we criticize you about it, then it just adds to the mantra of being one. Which ultimately gives you an identity, something you've been searching so hard for. I won't give you the satisfaction, good luck on your date"

(any reason is a good reason, even if you just need a job, but just remember that the motivation will fade). I love my job, love my tours, deployment, the people I work with. I'm blessed to be where I'm at, and I always remember that there is someone else who would kill to be in my shoes. oh yeah, and don't be that guy who post pro-trump political shit all over Facebook and say that you're a reborn Republic because of your new occupation."

178,"Sorry I'm late, traffic was bad. AHEM. Let's start off with your parents. Your dad has to be at least 60 to allow you to wear a mullet that disappoints the entire era, your mom must not love you enough to tell you ""girls will like you more clean-shaven,"" your dad must not have taught you what it was like to love a woman, your mom probably coddled you as a kid to make you have your huge ego about your intelligence (which is lacking, as you, in fact, look retarded. Seriously, you look like a rebellious autistic kid.) Lets move on to yourself. You think you're smart. You're not. You're in high school, so you may be smart for your age, but once you turn 35 and look at your decisions you've made in high school, you'll agree with me and say, ""Yeah, I was retarded."" Also, anyone with any sort of intelligence knows women like men who are either dumb and rebellious or smart and clean-shaven. A grungy-looking nerd is stupid. The only girl you'll ever get is the eventual one who will use you just so she can enter her own ""rape support group"" so she has someone to talk to. You think wearing dress-casual Polo shirts or whatever off-brand your mom can afford and dad refuses to shop for is cool. You just, again, look like even more of a retard, since I can imagine you also wearing khaki shorts, sandals, and socks. Finally, when you die, your body pillow of whatever anime character you want to have sex with the most will not cry over your dead corpse, only your mother will. Your dad will be too drunk to even know what's going on. 

Edit: you also look like a more retarded version of the streamer CarcinogenSDA. "
