0,"I gotta be honest here. You gotta dig down deep and stop drinking soda and eating processed foods. Its going to be hard, like really hard as you're probably addicted to sugar. But its not only your brain thats addicted, its also the bacteria in your gut - so you're going to have to wash it out with fiber and water.


Seriously, every time you're thirsty - drink water or tea. Thats it. And every day before school or work - grab an apple, orange, or banana on your way out the door. 


Throw on some headphones and walk around the block in the morning, every morning, to get the blood pumping and your metabolism up.


The sooner you start the better it will be, and it will get easier - fast. Faster than you think so just work hard with no excuses through the shitty first week. If you don't then you're probably going to have a pretty shit life. Its up to you, and no one else. "

12,"No, sweetheart. No.

You're a kid, and you clearly need some help. I know it's hard right now, but it usually does get better.

I'm gonna be honest here: I've not really seen girls be able to get as large as you at 16 without having either an extreme problem with waaaaaay too much refined sugars or a relatively severe hormone imbalance. 

Try cutting down on soda and other things high in refined sugar like bread and such. If you don't find the weight coming off even when your start exercising a bit, I'd advise you speak with your parents about going to a medical professional. That could be an early marker for PCOS or a thyroid condition, and it could be relatively severe in your case. PCOS is genetic, so if you have female relatives with it, I would advise you just go to a medical professional straight off.

Don't do any serious dieting at your age without going to a doctor as well.

Basically, you've got a lot of worrying signs. Please get medical help pronto."

Edit; because I'm tired of having to say this 10 different times to 10 different fucking people I'm not using this as an excuse. I've already started losing weight and I've been losing weight for over a year now."
33,That's exactly how I feel about this.  This girl does not need more people dumping on her.  Having people insult her will just make things so much worse.

Guy in the hoodie is a walking example of why birth rates in parts of Asia are plummeting. There's no way to get the anime body pillow he lost his virginity to pregnant. 

Guy with bag on his head should go with plastic the next time. Other guy is so utterly forgettable, if he died, his family would donate his body to a medical school knowing no one wanted his ashes or would visit a grave. "

78,In an alternate universe where Jon snow is retarded
79,"I'm surprised you ever got a ring on it, and lets break down why.

Before even looking at your photo, we need to address that user name. Already I can tell you're a horribly egocentric person. You're obviously very proud of having green eyes. That's probably your biggest accomplishment in life despite having no control over a genetic trait. But you relish in that as if it somehow makes you ""special"" or ""stand out"". It does not.

You also refer to yourself as ""girl"" despite the fact you're clearly pushing 30+. You haven't been cute for over half your life now. Give it up, it's just sad now.

But those aren't even the worst parts of your name, and not by a long shot. Giving credence to your star sign immediately tells us all you are both grossly ignorant and painfully annoying. I bet you try to excuse your bad life choices and personality flaws on your horoscope.

Now lets move on to that mess of a picture...

Your complete lack of body tone leads me to believe you've never even pondered the benefits of personal discipline. Why would you? Your life has been as empty and vanilla as the walls of your shitty apartment. That's why you need to see cliché quotes on wood instead of real art, because you have no life experience from which to appreciate impressionism.

Thick-rimmed glasses and cherry lipstick? Really? That look has been a stereotype of the whiny snowflake pseudo-feminist for YEARS now. So you either are as ignorant as your username suggests, or you're embracing the most deconstructive and self-harming subculture of our generation.  But I guess you need those because without overeager and gaudy accessories you would blend right the fuck into the wall behind you. Putting a cherry on top of vanilla ice cream doesn't make vanilla ice cream any more interesting. It's still so, so vanilla.

So to finally answer your question, you're divorced because you cornered a coward who was too afraid to break up with you. You probably proposed to him/her to which they reluctantly acquiesced. But even a spineless shell of a person would rather face life alone than at the side of something as annoying and unattractive as you. Vanilla."
80,Maybe if you cleaned the chocolate off the side of your mouth men would be more willing to approach you 
81,unroastable? your hairline must shrink backwards every time you tell a lie
82,"Water is the best part of that advice, most of the time hunger is a mixed signal. You drink some water and the hunger goes away, that stops you snacking on crap all day. "
83,I think the nose is drunker
84,"Genuinely surprised by the lack of gone wild posts in your history.  You seem like someone who really is desperate for attention.  
Your shirt says ""look at my tits"" and your eyes say ""Look me in the eyes.  Well, one eye, the other is going to wander off and look slightly to the left"" 
"
85,I would still bet mammal. Just not a land mammal.

Please let these comments be a wake up call for you. 
We don't know you or what you've been through. But you need to get healthy, change your habits. It will all play a part in you not 'hating life' anymore. 
Please stop wallowing in self pity... Don't you think it's better to feel proud of yourself? To make a true effort to change the things you don't like and feel proud of yourself?
I really wish you all the best. And if you need someone to talk to, just PM me. "

Well, you're not wrong -- but it's not for the reasons you're probably thinking.  There is absolutely nothing interesting about you.  Your one defining characteristic is that you're a pretentious douche bag... and that's not even that uncommon.  There are a million dudes out there just like you who will live and die and leave absolutely no mark on the world.  

Here is a gift from me to you since it is likely that no one else will write your obituary when you finally check out:

Today a basic little shitstain left this world.  He left no loved ones and no positive impact on humanity.  His remains will be cremated and flushed down the nearest public urinal.
