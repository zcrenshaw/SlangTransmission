0,"Your implants and cry for attention on here only highlight what you and everyone else already suspect... you are insecure.

Likely your insecurity stems from always questioning if you really ever earned anything by merit. Most people probably hand you things because they like looking at you. But that's made you vapid, shallow, and unable to perform  in any way that adds true value in the world.

Your relationships are superficial. Your romance life always has the shadow of doubt. Does he love you... or how you look? If you were disfigured, would anyone give you a second glance based on personality?

That nagging feeling will keep you looking for validation. It keeps you in the gym. It makes you post photos online looking for praise or positive attention. It keeps you going back for a nip here and tuck there. Before long you'll look like Donatella Versace with the personality of one of her handbags. 

You'll shift from being the center of attention to being part of a gaggle of women who make rude comments about younger girls because you feel jealous and rude comments about men who no longer pay attention to you.

You'd be better served working on being a better person than hunting for attention on Reddit, but you'll likely die young and your grave will be about as shallow as your personality.

**Edit**

Well this blew up.

First off, thanks for the gold. 

I do want to ask for the folks being vitriolic in the comments, please give this girl a break. She deleted her account. She was probably just marketing herself and didn't know what she was doing. Other posts outside of a roast someone asks to participate in are a violation of the /r/roastme rules and are generally just not cool.

To those who think I went too far, or was mean and out of line with the nature of the sub... sorry. My sense of humor is dry and I enjoy saying unexpected things. That combination came off as more mean spirited than I generally am. 

A few of you have been doxxing me or the girl who posted this. That is a clear violation of Reddit's TOS and is creepy and possibly illegal depending on how far you're taking it. Don't harass that girl on other accounts if you find her. Just leave it at what it was, a roast."
1,"We don't care lady.
You were amusement for a day, now it's the next day.

But I imagine you're used to that."

3,"Are Ex's allowed to post? Well, here it goes:

You wish you were a real actress so people couldn't see right through you. You look like your major in college was gold digging. You might be able to marry rich if you knew what to do with a dick when you see one. You're so desperate for attention you've gone from self-posting on r/prettygirls and r/goddesses to r/roastme. Your little shit of a purse dog is the only true loyalty you'll ever find, and even that is contingent on you continuing to feed it. Your tattoos of guns pointing at your vagina are probably there because the dumb-ass guys you've had to settle for need instructions in finding it under that Demi Moore-inspired bush of yours. You flossed your eyebrows more than a dentist flosses his teeth. Your nipples look like they had a fight with each other and are hiding on the opposite sides of your boobs. You obviously can't take criticism. You will die alone."
4,"You look like someone who would spend 2 hours on your hair and makeup and take about 50 selfies just to post on r/roastme because you think you'll be the first person in the history of this sub to be so hot that nobody can think of a bad thing to say about you, but that has never happened.

You look like the kind of person who frequents loud dance clubs because the loudness puts you on a level playing field with people who are interesting to talk to."
5,If only your IQ was as high as the number of hours you've neglected your daughter
6,"Wannabe Instagram model looking for work. Has GED and likes how everyone is always so nice. Talents include: PICS. Skilled in taking 3hrs to set up a selfie to look spontaneous, and makeup. Will do ""whatev's"" for money or coke.

10,That's not cleavage it's the Silicon Valley. 
11,The best Roast would be to not give her attention at all.
12,I was going to jerk off to this photo. But now I have to jerk off to this comment. Jesus. 
13,"Lady, you came to /r/roastme and are defending yourself in reply to negative comments. Do you not understand the purpose of this sub?"
14,It doesn't matter what you say. This will go down in the history of Reddit as The Great Roast
15,Jesus I'm from /r/all and enjoy RoastMe posts that pop up here and there. But I have never once read a roast this fucking savage before.  
16,"Jesus Christ, this isn't Chaturbate. Reddit gold doesn't give you actual money."
17,"shit... the other ones were personal, but this one was *personal* personal"
18,"Her: Gimme that I have no skills and need to marry for money look 
 
Team of plastic surgeons: Say no more"
19,"I don't know why you insist and doing  Q&amp;A videos on Instagram. No one gives a shit. We follow you because you're hot, but you're not interesting. Stop deluding yourself.  

Edit: No I won't give you her instagram. Stop messaging me."
20,That ring light you used for your selfie makes your eyes and narcissism really pop.
21,"""Apparently I make reddit very angry.""

Guys, I think she's mildly retarded.  "
22,"I'm not sure the mods have big enough quotations for ""*Celebrity*"""
23,"Everything about this is way too intentional for the ""fuck it"" pageantry. You want people to think you just wrote some shit down on a card, snapped a quick photo, and threw it to the virgins to shout out your fake tits as masked compliments? It takes more bravery for some regular ass teenager to snarl their brace-face in homeroom than it does for your fake fuck it Instagram lite compliment fishing trip. 

[Private message update](http://imgur.com/a/cWsiO). And as a response: stop using your real name for everything you silly fuck."
24,The definition of a depreciating asset. 
25,"Like passing a taco bell and going ""oh yeah I was gonna grab chipotle"""
26,Damn.... You made her delete the account ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
27,"You came here to get low-key complimented, then when people actually roasted you you feel the need to explain why they are wrong, because you're too insecure to laugh it off. 

Roll with the punches. It's a roast me, not secretly compliment me in the disguise of an insult. "
28,I always issue my apologies in full lingerie.
29,Goddamn
30,You can't take a roast on twitter how the hell can you on Reddit?
31,Deleted her account when it hit r/all
32,[deleted]
33,"Was she expecting everyone to throw their hands up and say ""oh how could we possibly...""?"
34,"Could be worse, she could have Keemstar as a father figure."
35,"You look like every basic ass Kardashian wannabe in this world, draw your eyebrows in thicker please. Just the sight of you screams insecurity to me, you hate yourself so much compliments only serve to devalue the person giving them. You spent two hours getting ready to take this picture and have no plans to even leave the house today. You'll fuck your fill of badboys and then right at 30 settle down with a chump who has been chasing you for years. He'll think he has hit the jackpot, but we both know you aren't worth the sheets he fucks you on. You will continue to get your fill of sexually satisfying attention from men you actually prefer over social media and private messaging apps like kik while sitting in the Mercedes your mealticket bought you. Eventually you'll have his kid, locking in this lifestyle forever. You'll end up fucking some of your meal ticket's friends or worse, family, because the dirty validation seeking slut that comes out after a few drinks is the real you. He'll forgive you because he's a bitch. 

edit: gooby pls"
36,"I'd roast you, but I don't have the $350 you charge per hour."
37,"""deeply disturbing *penisgraphic* DM's"" "
38,what about that girl so fat that the top roast was a heartfelt advice about how to get help?
39,tfw your r/RoastMe thread doesn't even reach top spot bc some girl with fake tits wanted to get compliments and we made her delete her account
40,"If this were a game of marry, fuck, kill I'd fuck the girl, marry the comment, and kill myself because I'd know I've peaked.

Edit: Holy shit my first gold!! Also I fixed my misspelling of peaked because I am a weak, weak man."
41,"I bet the title of this post is roughly 66% of your active vocabulary. The other 33% being the word ""me""."
42,"I don't know why you posted here, honestly. Plenty of other prominent ""e-celebrities"" have roasted you with more thought and care than any one Reddit comment ever could. Maybe it's your hubris and fame-mongering that leaves you to continually scrape and claw at your own venomous, vapid relevance knowing more than anyone that your clock is ticking, both as someone in your career field as well as a father. Your daughter will grow-up see how you presented yourself to others and probably feel a great amount of disgust at the idea that her life was built on a foundation of the superficial goings-on of superficial people. Most likely she will cut contact with you as she matures much like a majority of people who take an interest in you, and as your once primped and pointed beard becomes grey and withered you will realize what you really are: Old and a-gnome."
43,People who roast like this have peered into the abyss and have had it stare back.
44,"* deleted.

You guys won.

56,"It's ridiculous that Roastme celebrated. The point of this sub was not to drive people to deletion by doxxing and saying hateful things. It was meant to be light-hearted humour all in jest. People were taking this way too seriously, and it's detrimental to the sub as less people are going to want to participate."

67,"we get it, you learned contouring"
68,"The ol' ""Bae caught me..."" model. Nobody cares enough to actually invest time since she screams ""don't stick your dick in crazy"" so she just spends all her free time coming up ways of trying to take creative selfies until she finally to start going full instagram model and shows more and more before finally just becoming a cam slut."
69,"I agree it was getting toxic and Reddit's angry virgins were definitely showing ... but I don't agree that roastme comments always have to be light-hearted ... I mean, the best roasts tend to cut straight to the core, you know? That's part of what makes it fun."
70,Agreed

81,Yeah she already got nuked of the planet.
82,"deleted her reddit account and went back to the Periscope echo chamber where she's showered in compliments by white knights and orbiters. Guess she never expected what she thinks about herself deep down to be posted here by random people. 

Probably still reading here while the losers on periscope go unanswered and can't figure out why they never get the attention they deserve. 

EDIT: She made a new account and PM'd me around 2AM CST. Definitely still here reading the comments. "
83,It's the only ring she'll ever get. 
84,Remember to wash your finger next time after ticking your prostate and trying to convince yourself you  aren't the sole reason why YouTube has gone to shit.
85,"Seriously, did she expect people to not completely shit on her in a subreddit dedicated to insults?










Edit: I did not expect so many replies to this comment. Doxxing is unacceptable and the mods all over Reddit do an excellent job at trying to prevent it. However when posting your photo on a public forum and using the same username as your other accounts, you should realize the risk that comes along with it. Especially if you are an outlier (i.e. Someone especially good looking on a subreddit that's encouraged to rip you a new one.)"

131,"This subreddit is hilarious. I found this sub like a year ago when this ""roasting"" thing became internet popular, and I left after a week or so when every semi-attractive girl got told the exact same things about her. Daddy issues, shallow, no personality, insecure, gold-digger, vapid, some insults about her eyebrows and makeup. Every post, without fail,  the same comments

Come across this sub again from an /r/bestof post and surprise, this ""omg the most epic roast in this sub's history"" was basically a conglomeration of the same stereotypes this place was giving girls over a year ago

And then to top it all off, this girl is a ""fashion model"" who knew how this subreddit would react to her pics and would get her a shit-ton of attention. And, like clockwork, she starts posting about it on her Instagram because she got the attention she always wanted and this place gave it to her, and of course makes her post about in a lingerie shot with her boobs and ass out in the open.

She even says ""Yes, I did ask for this"" because she knew what would come from it, and this subreddit gave her what she was seeking and is too stupid to recognize it. She'll probably get even more Instagram followers and modeling work strictly because of this.

Great work fam."
132,She probably couldn't go wrong making a horror comedy picture book out of all the weird fucked up shit she probably got DM'd

217,Holy shit you guys killed one. 
218,How many times do I have to tell you that doing a Gay porn ad for $50 doesn't make you a model?
219,Really? What did she say? I'm kind of hurt I didn't receive a message.
220,She even has a professional light rig just for this kind of attention. You can see the circular led lights in her eyes. 
221,No. Look up for a bukkake. You'll like it.

225,The only difference is hookers get paid :(
226,"That private message.

Damn, who posts a pic in r/roastme and then sends pissy PMs fighting back? That's just weird."
227,i don't think it was the insults as much as the just utter insanity that followed. let's not act like she was the retarded one here.
228,"There's no need for reddit to roast you . . . There are plenty of people who have already done a fine job of that on YouTube. You do know that you are the most hated fuck on the internet, right?"
229,Thank you. (Just the tip)
230,"""Literally just took a pic""

After slathering on tons of makeup, setting up a professional light rig (you can see the LED ring reflection in her eyes), blowing out her hair (probably professionally) and Photoshopping her underboob to give it more lift and make her waistline look smaller.

But sure, ""just took a pic"""
231,Your cleavage betrays your fake self esteem... nice try.
232,Leafy's chin is more prominent than your entire channel.
233,holy shit she did.

240,She couldn't bear with the honest truth in the comments so she deleted her account LMAO.
241,I knew I smelt burning plastic 
242,Vote this as one of the best roasts out there 
243,Has the internet ever lost against a roastee?
244,"Na man, she is really attractive, no one can say otherwise. That is why it is so pathetic for her to post here. "
245,You look like the only thing you know how to add is more makeup.
246,Your tits are so fake you're not even eligible for the pink ribbons.  
247,Holy fucking shit. I haven't seen such epic obliteration since NYC at the end of the first Avengers movie. God damn.

260,You know you're fucked when gay people send you back over the rainbow 
261,You're trying to cover your chest hair aren't you
262,"&gt; but I'm broke

This is what I see that is roastable. Hating on your because you are hot and learned how to do make-up, groom your brows, and know how to pick out flattering clothing is easy. But I can tell from that pic that you are living a cookie cutter apartment. Maybe a one-bedroom, but probably sharing with some roomies; 2 of whom are equally as hopelessly lost in the here-and-now and maybe one who will get out, get married, and move on with her life. You will continue down the path of buying what you want right now and build no equity in your life. Hopefully you will find a rich professional willing to put up with your poor sense of humor long enough to make the mistake of proposing, so you can get out with his house and a kid you will emotionally neglect. "
263,"She deleted her account! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

267,I can't believe you gave yourself credit for superimposing words on... that...
268,She handled that way better than the devs for No Man's Sky. Didn't even have to wait several months for a response.
269,"Exactly. Right after what the guy above you quoted, she said thanks to the majority who were actually funny. It would seem people are now doing again exactly what she was talking about, being assholes and not just making jokes. "
270,"&gt;Many people ~~would~~ have.

"
271,"""I HAVE TO ROAST HIM FAST!!!11!111"""
272,Those dumb science bitches couldn't even make her more smarter. 
273,I'm glad that the dollar I donate every month finally got you a meal
274,This is the response of someone who suffered a heavy duty ego check but realizes she's past the point of no return in terms of the image she's crafted for herself.
275,I think you're unroastable because the fat content is too high.

282,Was she famous or something?  Like.. instagram famous?
283,How's this supposed to help you stop fondling kids? 
284,Thankfully at least your tits are big enough to draw attention away from your face.
285,Underneath the three pounds of makeup and pushup bra you are just another boring bitch that probably likes The Chainsmokers and insisted on the unicorn frappe from Starbucks. Also known as basic. 
286,Was thinking exact same thing.

291,"Stop linking her Insta. Stop linking the sub with her name. Stop linking her in any way, stop asking for the links. Come on guys, you saw the sticky comment in the roast thread, if you have shit to say then say it here.

301,"lol he wasn't even defending her, he just said people reused the same insult over and over.. member this https://www.reddit.com/r/RoastMe/comments/3h03sd/validate_my_insecurities/ .  That was one of the best thread ever created imo. Most of the insult was on point, even the OP herself actually responded with witty replies.. I've never seen anything better than that thread in this sub again unfortunately."
302,A suicide girl who we'd actually rather see dead
303,I have no idea who this is. Can someone fill me in?
304,This is fake news. I'd NEVER allow 4K video to be taken of me. I'd consume my entire medicine cabinet.
305,"Reddit really can't handle teasing.

RoastMe is a fine idea, but some people really can't stand pretty girls -- and no matter how you slice it, she is pretty. From the tenor of her instagram post, she seems like a chill enough person too. Some people managed to make up jokes (that tread the same territory they always do with pretty girls), while others really did just spew their own insecurities -- ie ""get mad.""

But RoastMe isn't alone.

The concept of ""cringe"" started out with some sympathy for people, but it turned into ""make fun of socially awkward people, people who embrace liberal views too strongly, and ugly people.""

PC Master Race started out tongue in cheek, but it's full of real arrogance now (and bragging about multi-thousand dollar computers while championing the idea of a $300 gaming machine)."
306,Peaked. Just sayin. 
307,"Why is this tagged as ""Celebrity""?"
308,"I'm not going to lie though, if I was given a chance I would still slam that like some pogs back in 1996."

315,"Man, there''s a lot of people here who *care a little bit too much* about saying how much they hate her or how horrible she is."
316,I rotated the phone and your forehead took up the whole screen.
317,"HEY

318,Keep up the hair grease and you will look like you actually just had a shower.
319,"It's not a roast, he straight took a flamethrower to her."
320,"When you posted in r/friendzone asking for advice in making friends because you don't have any they told you get a hobby. Posting in r/roastme every few weeks is not a hobby, it's a sad cry for attention. 

Congrats you have fat tits and a mouth, that's why your ""boyfriend"" is still with you. Time to go get a personality, read some books so you'll be able to contribute to conversations that aren't just about video games, some bangs to cover up that land mass above your eyes, and you'll be ready for society.

Her whole ""I don't care about this, never heard of you, but I'm going to take the time to PM you and everyone else who talks shit on me"" reminds me of a certain celebrity... "

335,"These are what I come here for. The pedo jokes and usual stuff are low effort static. For me, this is the heart and soul of this sub."
336,"The human incarnation of narcissism. You spend 2 hours on your makeup every morning because deep down you know that without the plastic facade that is your attractiveness, people would see that you are as empty, shallow and worthless as a garbage bag. And at least a garbage is good for putting trash in, what good do you do for the planet, or humanity? You've probably never thought about it. All you ever think about is how many likes on instagram you can get, as if that's some measure of worth, as if it justifies the Oxygen you take from the air, and the resources you consume that could go to people who actually have something to offer to humanity.

337,"This is the truest thing I've read all day, and I've been reading math proofs. "
338,"What's going on in your forehead region, ghost eyebrows above your real ones? "
339,"Seriously. Even if she is actually vain and vapid, the vitriol getting thrown her way is ridiculous."

430,"Reddit will believe anything as long as they want it to be true. 

I'll watch people link comments from questionable subreddits as 'proof', but because it sounds nice, it gets treated like some kind of undeniable fact by far too many people. Then someone will come along and point out the obvious and they get immediately downvoted because it doesn't fit in with the current grain.

It's the same thing with the hate-bandwagons that so often surround popular people. You get one person who says that they met or knew someone who met [...] and they weren't very nice to them that one time, so clearly they're just an awful person. 

And everyone consumes that information like a fat kid with cake, because cake is fucking delicious, despite that it's completely devoid of anything actually useful to you.

Half the time I feel like I could say something that people want to believe, create a link that doesn't go anywhere except to some 404 page, and people would probably still upvote me anyways.

536,"One of the few reasons I prefer to look at men getting roasted over women is the fact that people are actually funny and creative when roasting men. The majority of the comments on a woman are about how she has sex a lot (which is somehow bad), or is plastic looking for attention. With 3 or 4 actually funny roasts lingering in the comments. All the rest will be unfunny, and almost mean to the point where I'm wondering why these people lash out so hard. The prettier the woman, the worse it is too. Medium attractive girls get some funny comments, and the disfigured and plain ugly are the ones that actually get funny roasting comments (with the additional side of ""lol u can't get laid"", which confuses me because they ream the prettier ones for having sex)."
