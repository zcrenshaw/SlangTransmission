0,I've always wondered what Macklemore looks like with down syndrome
1,Your uncle had very good legal reasons for breaking it off
2,"Not sure if it's just bad eye makeup, or bad boyfriend eye makeup."
3,You look like a nazi propaganda poster if nazis were also [argonian](https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/elderscrolls/images/d/df/Argonian8.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20111211092032) 
4,Awesome that you can paint your face blue and be the guy from Avatar every Halloween. 
5,As a gay guy I had a hard time figuring out why someone would dump you. And then I realized you were a chick. 
6,I'm sure this isn't the first time you've drank a bunch of Kraken and had a penis on your stomach. 
7,because you look like lindsay lohan's face stretched over jean claude van damme's skull.
8,"Cant roast you for turning ur life around , good job."
9,"The markers are for the board, not your brows!"

22,You look like ed sheerans retarded brother
23,"Because although you're sufficiently attractive enough for girls to be interested, you're too big of a pussy to actually smile or look at one, let alone actually speak to one without stumbling all over your words and coming off as a complete freak-show. 

I'd recommend picking up a drinking habit. The slurred speech and blatantly artificial courage will be far preferable to the stuttering mumbles and lack of eye-contact that you're currently working with.  "
24,You look like the teacher we all thought was hot in middle school but in hindsight we just hadn't discovered the internet yet
25,"How in the world did you pull off getting that shirt in what... 5 hours?

37,Probably because you look like you make lampshades out of human skin
38,"When making eyecontact during a ~~conversion~~, how often do you have to tell people to just pick one eye?

EDIT: conversation, not conversion."
39,Wearing a picture of yourself? Wow. Narcissist. 
40,"Don't worry, you'll meet plenty of nice guys in rehab."

85,"Damn, I knew I SAW that face somewhere"

224,You're less convincing than the Parkinson's Disease Foundation's mannequin challenge 
225,"The worst part of having someone you love become addicted to meth is that they won't acknowledge their addiction and you're forced to watch them spiral until you have to make the decision to cut loose or they'll pull you down with them. And then you have some who have a moment of clarity, start rehab, and shortly thereafter decide that they don't need rehab and they end up back on it worse than they started. This shit hits me too close to home and I really feel awful for anyone who has also gone through this. 

It's easy to mock an addict of stuff like meth because people think ""well goddamn everyone knows how bad it is it's their own fault"" but I can promise you, every meth addict you meet had pretty much one of two starting stories:

1- they had a bad medical problem, got addicted to opiates, couldn't afford them, and ended up going for meth or heroin

2- someone they were close with told them it wasn't nearly as bad as made to sound and that they'd like it. That person wasn't too far gone at the time and by the time the person they started on it gets to their level, the original person is hitting the glass dick two times as much as they once were


First hand experience with meth: if you have a mental illness or pain or severe depression, that first hit will take it all away immediately and you won't feel it again for ten or twelve hours. You're gonna be up another eighteen now. It's the first time in years your depression hasn't been pushing you down every day and you're now functioning again and you have energy and you don't have pain. You're gonna keep doing it because the cognitive association with ""meth is bad"" isn't your experience because you're actually happy now and people like you again. 

Over the coming weeks, you find the right combination of cologne or perfume to hide the ammonia smell from how you're deeply dehydrated, you double up on your concealer or you buy some aviators to hide the circles that show you're sleeping three hours a night. You're driving across town at 3am because your plug doesn't operate in the day. You have to spend twenty minutes inside a house that reeks of dog piss and cigarettes because you're not allowed to just come and go because that gets you blacklisted. You miss your first hit for some reason and have to go a couple hours without t and you can feel your eyes get jittery in their sockets when you try to look out the corner of your eyes. You take a nap and every ten minutes you are startled awake by something you imagined. You start talking to yourself late at night and get fixated on single sentences. You grind your teeth. Brushing the back of your mouth makes you gag because of how dry your mouth is so you start neglecting hygiene. You stop showering 30 minutes a morning like you used to, opting for quick washes so you have time to clean your bowl for the coming day. 

You start falling behind on bills and ditching your friends. You see stuff that isn't there. You think you're being followed all the time. You break your high end phone you once loved and are now rocking a four year old cracked up phone you bought off Craigslist. You stop seeing your cousins at your weekly dinners because they might notice. You stop going to regular events because you don't know if you'll be able to take a hit there. 

Your last friend has to leave your life because he's cried too many nights watching you stumble around in a zombie state. 


Hopefully tonight you don't get arrested or killed. 


Edit: if you know or suspect someone you know or love has stated using meth, please, fight kick and scream to get them away from it as quickly as possible. By the time they might notice the negative effects, they're already hooked and not in the right mind to pull away from it. "
