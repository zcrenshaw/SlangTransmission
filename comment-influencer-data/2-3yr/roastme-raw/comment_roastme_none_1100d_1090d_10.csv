&gt; 9 confirmed mental illnesses

Self diagnosed for attention just like your made up date of birth

&gt;roast me harder than life has

=""Give me more attention based on fabricated facts about myself.""  

Not only does everyone see *around* you because you're too self-obsessed to treat yourself to a square meal (let me guess, ""anorexia-nervosa related body dysmorphia,""), but everyone sees *through* you because you trumpet your ""uniqueness"" and ""struggle"" from the mountain top of your depression, despite having never faced a real life challenge, hardship, or slight inconvenience.  "
19,The nose is for crayons.
20,"When white people say they have a black friend, they mean you."

40,"You're insecure enough to insult everyone whilst proclaiming your virtues. You must have very thin-skin. Perhaps any insult at all will deeply upset you. 

While I cannot insult your physique, I can insult your intelligence. You've already established yourself to be lacking in self-awareness, and it's known that most philosophers and inspirers don't boast of themselves in order to gain internet sympathy. 

You're likely a pedantic and third-rate philosopher who may have a collection of mediocre writing samples and thoughts as token evidence. It's more than likely you are the opposite of an inspirer, seeing as inspirers are confident people who can believe in themselves without putting others down and boasting themselves up.

In short, your statement has persuaded me that you are neither a capable philosopher nor inspirer. A thin body doesn't equal talent for abstract thought and interpersonal skills. But, because you lack self-awareness, you may indeed be a capable software-developer.

45,"You look like the kind of guy that tried to join a frat, got kicked out for making an ass of himself, and still tries to act as ""frat""  as possible to hold on to the one point in your life you thought you were somewhat popular. "
46,"You're a rapper? Sorry, dude, but the Special Olympics is the only track you're ever going to be on. "
47,"&gt; ""Philosopher"" = ""**Pot-smoking** High School Dropout""

Probably more accurate."
48,Holy shit
49,"Good idea: going on a date in a poorly lit place so he/she/it can't get a good look at your face.

Bad idea: being so attention starved that you have to make a roast thread while out to eat.

Worse idea: wearing an ugly ass shirt on a date that bunches up around your almost nonexistent tits.

50,He walks too fast for me to keep up. You'd think all this mouthbreathing I do would get me enough oxygen to catch him...
51,"Dear Amanda,

Jesus, you must have a mattrass as pillow."

one of these people that all they do is talk about the 'mental illnesses' they have - she hides behind these because she has no substance otherwise - she's not interesting or different or special and she knows it so she latched herself on to all this bull shit  - look at her post history haha omg - its literally her taking every fucking chance she can to tell people about her 'mental illnesses' fucking get over yourself. Id love to know what the fucking PTSD is from - your grand mommy pass away when you were 8? did someone micro agrees you out front of the thrift store? you never been thru a fucking struggle in your life and probably have 2 parents paying for all your bulshit docs and therapists and meds etc. what a fucking disappointment. In all fairness even if you gained weight you just look like another regular thick eyebrow white girl normie with zero fucking flavor but I'm guessing you know that so you try to be the 'damaged and ruined manic pixie'. i know I'm ranting but this chik is such a literal fucking cliche if i saw you as a character in a movie i would be like -''jesus christ they're really over doing it and trying to hard with the 'omg look at me I'm broken and damaged and issues and problems' edge dyke character - this is too much''
sad part (not really) is you will never grow out of this bc you made it your identity - thats why you'll be alone for ever bc its not that people don't want to be around people with mental illnesses - that would be mean - its that people don't want to be around an empty human with no personality so they created one by acquiring as many fakeable 'disorders' as she can manage to google. no one wants to hear you talk about that bullshit when its just for attention. your parents know its for attention. everyone around you does. thats why your on the internet looking for more attention. now that you got your self pity fuel take that old wooden box from under your bed - the one decorated with shitty emo band logos you doodled and other 'dark hot topic-alt girl' fodder, open it up and take out your favorite blade or knife and get to slicing up those inner thighs. then don't forget to take pics of it to send to who ever pretends to care and talk post all about it on tumblr."
