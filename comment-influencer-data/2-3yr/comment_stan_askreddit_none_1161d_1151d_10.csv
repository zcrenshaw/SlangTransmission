"I'm surprised this hasn't been said yet, but

Eminem- Stan

And 

Eminem- Bad guy

Bad guy is literally a continuation of the story of stan, but told through the eyes of stans little brother, matthew, instead of the eyes of stan/Eminem in the song ""stan"".

The beat change in ""bad guy"" is pretty intense too, as it's basically Eminem explaining the point of why he made this song and what stan/matthew actually represent."
