"Excellent work, inspector.
You have served Arstotzka well.
Glory to Arstotzka."
I'm guessing her trip was cancelled and she needed a reason to return the items (in her mind).
It should be illegal for people this stupid to drive cars. 
The only thing more satisfying would be having one of those giant red stamps for it. ENTRY DENIED!
Passport not required for Arstotzka! Arstotzka best country!
"&gt;Important Foreman: ""Well, we start at six.""

""Great, then you have time to get coffee and doughnuts. See you at seven."""
And now to decide if we're going to be cold or hungry this week...
Just like her friends probably invented that it was cancelled to avoid the giant bitch.
"Sounds like buyers remorse, and just using you as a reason for a return."
"&gt; I couldn't come in until now

I hate that excuse. At my shop I have a 30 day window in which people can come back if my sewing fails and I will redo the work. I had a guy in a little while ago with two pairs of jeans that I replaced the zippers on. The new zippers were MANGLED. He tried to claim that they broke the first time he put them on but couldn't come back in until now... which was at least 6 months since I did the job. I didn't believe him, so I charged him again... but did give him a microscopic discount to keep him happy."
"Weird, sketchy behavior with lots of loud, distracting children? I peg it as an 80% chance she was stealing, using her kids as either cover or as mini thieves themselves.

Remaining 20% is she's just batshit crazy."
What idiot can't remember 1234 5678? That is such a convenient number. Some people.
I can't tell if this is a foiled thief or if there really was a customer this stupid.
I work at a bank now. It feels like Papers Please all the time. I found a phoney check the other day. Unfortunately they haven't given me the key to the gun cabinet yet. 
"You're both making my head hurt with multiple tickets and draws.

I'll just take my one Power Ball and leave."
"Back in my bartending days I had a guy show me a photocopy of his passport as ID. 

His passport photo was also taken when he was 8.

I declined to serve him. He was confused as to why."
"&gt;slicing and serving customers

I'll have a pound of sliced customer please. "
Trapping someone against a fridge to yell at them sounds like something worth calling the police over.
"A little known fact..

According to the FAA (this comes from safety training for pilots), ""only 30% of verbal communication is received and understood by either side in a conversation.""

I'm suprised this concept isn't more widely understood and taught to customer facing employees. It explains about 99% of the crap we see and deal with on /r/TalesFromRetail, /r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk and other such subreddits.

TLDR; it's scientifically proven people don't fucking listen 70% of the time"
"Why are people so dumb? I've read stories where there's storms of huge accidents and customers are still milling around trying to shop even though they should have evacuated a long time ago. Like, if they want to die, then let them have at it, but it's usually our butts on the line trying to get them the hell out so they don't. "
"
&gt;Yeah, you're going to want to open at six instead

Actually not at all."
"Oh, Jorji."
Ah people who don't plan ahead....
"My money is on thief. 

Also, OP really needs to get some door locks!"
Should have detained her. Would have made some extra cash.

To those curious: an expired ID is one of the most common forms of fraud so most states make it explicitly illegal to use for alcohol and other times where valid ID is very much required at checkout. I like it when clerks explain that they would lose their job and possibly get sued on top of it if the store loses its liquor license and I would add that these customers should be redirecting their anger into political activism if they feel it's wrong as the stores really have no power here; heck I bet the big corporate stores already lobby to get the ID check penalties lessened or removed so they're already technically on the side of the IDless.
"Why do people think dominance requires lying and other under-handed tactics? How about being honest, fair, and stand your ground too? Not enough of a man for that, Mister Foreman?"
"When I worked at a university library we had bomb threats a couple of times, and I was one of the ones in charge of clearing the floors. Without fail, there would be someone in the computer labs, typing away and ignoring us when we told them they had to leave. I couldn't leave without clearing the floor, so I'd have to call the University PD - who were actual cops, not just security guards. 

I took to doing it right in front of them. The students would inevitably get mad, but the police always came quick and chewed them a new one for ignoring the fire alarm lights, the people in safety vests telling them to GTFO, and endangering the officers for making them have to come and remove them from the building.

I loved watching their haughty little faces fall when that happened."
Good work Comrade. Your family will be upgraded to a class 7 dwelling.
"*slips note*

&gt; Someone will stop by tomorrow to remedy this situation. Look for the man with the red scarf and tan hat. Await further instruction. "
"&gt; Me: 'Alright, when would you like to pick it up?' CFL: 'Tomorrow afternoon.'

Since I like to troll sometimes just to see how people react, I likely would have replied, ""That's fine, ma'am, but we need two weeks notice. However, we can rush this for a fee. Due to the high level of complexity, that cake will now be $12,642.17. What time would you like to pick it up tomorrow, ma'am?"""
"I hadn't thought of that.. Hopefully that was it. Didn't have to drag me into it, though :/"
Haha what a goober
"Is not about time, or money, friend. Is about glory for Arstotzka. "
"One of my regulars is this tough looking little pitbull of a guy. Probably in his late forties or so, looks like a complete badass, tattoo across his throat making it look like it's been slit, the whole nine yards. Started crying to me a couple weeks ago because his two year old grandbaby has a brain tumor. I gave him a big hug. Every once in a while, retail really brings on the feels."
"Not only the haircut, but the body posture to go along with it"
"What is he doing to these jeans? I've never had a zipper fail on a jeans, or even any other pair of pants. Buttons come off, belt loops get ripped off, asses get ripped out, etc - but I've never broken a zipper.

"
"#*ERR ERR AH, AH AH EE*   "
"Starting at 6 means your crews don't get out until 7. Crews need to be briefed on their jobs, grab the tools from the warehouse, get breakfast and coffee.

I worked for a pool company and we'd get to jobs at least an hour after we clocked in."
*Warning: 40-something Soccer Mom detected. Immediate evacuation is advised.*
"I thought a lady was ignoring me once. Even rolled my eyes and muttered ""good talk"" after asking if she needed help a few times.

She was deaf.

I felt so bad."
"You no like passport I understand, 

I come back with better one 

~Jorji Costava"
Cobrastan is not a real country.
"Finally an OP who says English isn't their first language who's writing isn't better than mine!  

But really OP, your English is definitely good enough to get the story across and give me a couple laughs.  Like many people from the US, I don't even claim to know a second language.  "
"""Hi, I bought these a couple of weeks ago intending to eat them but didn't because I don't plan ahead and ended up wasting food. I would like a refund so that I tell all my friends it's totally cool to waste everyone's time and your company's inventory, because I never have to pay for my mistakes."""
"For the record, it was also 11:00."
"Who keeps a folded up sale sign in their purse for 3-4 months? And she saved less than $3 with her little trick, how can that even be worth looking like a complete jerk to the people working there. I swear, I wish some of these people could see how they look from our POV."
"Oh man. When I ask my customers ""So when do you need this for?"" they love to answer ""Oh, I'm in no hurry. Tomorrow afternoon will be fine!"" I want to punch them. THAT IS A RUSH YOU DINGUS! lol It gets a +40% rush fee added to it."
"""Oh, maybe you'll need some sage as well.""

I almost spit my soda everywhere"
Does she have that type of haircut?
Then a terrorist attack cuts your day short and you don't receive government compensation and your son starves to death. 
"I'm reading a book at the moment called ""Being Mortal"" about the crisis of elderly/geriatric care being pushed aside in our society, and the contrast of that against your act of love for this old woman makes me so happy. A lot of people think retail is just a pushover job you do for the cash, but it truly is possible to bless people in your role!
Go u/picklebugboo !"
"Why are people so stupid, why?"
"""It calls upon the Dark Lord to smite your enemies.  So if you purchase it, tomorrow, I shall be dead."""

But that makes it *your* emergency!!!
"&gt; When I worked at a university library we had bomb threats a couple of times

Finals Week, was it?"
"Babies are extremely sensitive to scents and chemicals, and scented wipes would likely cause skin irritations or other issues for her child. I hope someone tells this woman that before she harms her baby by trying to make them smell pretty. As long as a baby is kept clean and healthy, they won't smell bad, and that's far more important than her having a baby that smells like this months star fragrance. "
"No lie-  I'm a school psychologist, and I just met with a 7th grader who did this same thing because the principal gave her a detention after the student called her a bitch. So your customer had the same emotional reaction and made the same poor choice as a middle school girl. "
