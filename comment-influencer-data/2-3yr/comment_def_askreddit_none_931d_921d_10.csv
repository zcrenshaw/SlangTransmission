In my defense I was in my early 20's, only my second long term relationship. I should have seen these as giant red flags, but .... yeah. Lesson learned. 

**Edit** : Yep, I do know this isn't 100% a solid test for fidelity. Yep, you could point out any one of these ""signs"" and by itself it def doesn't mean cheating. Yes some people are just private people - it's more important if these things listed are changes from the norm. This is just what I noticed from personal experience. The more boxes get ticked the more concerned I would be personally.

"0-12: Oh look at the boy and girl playing! They're boyfriend girlfriend def!

I never understand why people complain about the over-sexualization of children, then when babies play together they insist that the boy is a ""ham"" cause he likes playing with the girls or whatever phrasing they want to use.

Edit: For proper spelling"
"Bleached tips.  Saw all the boy bands doing it and thought, ""yeah, I''ll def look just as good"".  I didn't."
