1,"Seinfeld

I'm only 19 years old so I wasn't really around to watch it live. I always thought that it was some old boring show. Then one day I sat through a whole episode that was on the tv. After that I watched all 9 seasons in a very short amount of time... And I loved it! "
2,"Avatar: The Last Airbender

I remember hearing rave reviews about it for years, but never got around to watching the series until right around the time LoK came out.

I can't do my eyebrows or eyeliner I don't know how to do my hair I don't have a flawless face or body. I mean yea sure I can work on it but I don't want to have to cake on makeup.. Is it even worth it? Losing weight I can do but then what? Spend hundreds each month for makeup that'll just be a fake me!? I don't want to be fake but I want to be pretty.

I said ok and asked what his friends name was so he didn't end up paying for some random guys ride, and he said ""well, i'm just a Jewish guy with a lot of black friends...let me check, i forgot."" About thirty seconds later he says ""ok his name is Rob"".

So despite my gut feelings, i picked up Rob and bring him over to this guys place, where he has us wait for 10 minutes because Jewish guy had to run to the bank. He comes back and gets in the car and they're talking really quietly in the back seat, make an exchange ($800 of cocaine) and then I have to bring this Rob guy back home. I talked to Rob and was cool about it, but told him he can't just be doing cocaine deals in the back seat of cars, and that he should get dropped off and get picked up by someone else after. He apologized, bought me some McDonalds and that was that.

After that he was thrown into a soviet work camp instead (because he was german) where he got malaria and almost died. 

My point is; just because you see the uniform doesn't mean that the person in it stood for what it meant. Germany under ww2 isn't like it is today. If you got drafted you either joined the military, or died. 

I have a pic of him in his uniform if anyone is interested.

98,"Two things; First one was when I was super sick. We were supposed to hangout that day, but I ended up staying home and sleeping in bed. After a few hours I heard a noise in my house, but figured it was me imagining it and fell back asleep. I wake up a few minutes later and shes sitting on my fucking bed looking at me. I legit freaked out even though she did it to ""check up"" on me (im pretty sure she thought I was lying). To this day I have no idea how she got into my house and I still partially think it was just a fever induced dream or something.

Second time was with the same chick, it was near the end of our incredibly shitty relationship and we broke up shortly afterwords. She came over and we were watching the old texas chain saw massacre movie when she suddenly wanted to have sex. At this point I legit just hated her and sex with her grossed me out but I eventually caved because she wouldnt shut up. As we're getting into it the movie gets to the point where the main character is being forced to sit at leatherfaces family dinner table and theyre talking about eating her. The screams from the movie were already starting to freak me out so I said I wanted to change it to something different, she actually got MAD at me for wanting to do that and made me turn it up even LOUDER, it was almost as if she got off on the screams. Needless to say I barely performed (cuz you know the murdering going on) and was the worse sex of my life. Thankfully we broke up very shortly after.

Bonus stories are: 
Pregenancy scares, as in acting like she was pregnant even though we knew she wasnt.
Getting mad at me for going through her purse, even though she told me to do it to grab a movie...
I was only 16 while she was 20...which sounds cool at first, but she was just super weird about it and bragging about it all the time.

She was just a super weird fucking person and as far as I know has four kids, lives in a trailer park, and raises fucking goats....so Im pretty sure I dodged a massive bullet there.

EDIT: forgot to add, shortly after we broke up she started seeing her now husband. We saw eachother one day and she walks up to me says ""penis check"" and fucking groped me whispered something in my ear about me and her husband doing stuff and walked away...all infront of our co-workers. "

102,"A little late to the floor, but here goes. 

Again a second hand story, about my Brother in law's Uncle, who was a Doctor in a small town in South India. Let's call him Dr I. 

One night after closing his clinic, he was asleep at home. There was a knock on the door of his home. Dr I's grandmother opened the door (in India there are two layered doors - an internal one and an external one, here the internal one was opened with the a see through external one locked for any additional protection). 

So in front of his grandmother was a person, in the dark of the night, asking (in the local tongue - Tamil) for the Doctor to help his wife who was pregnant and was in urgent need of medical care. The grandmother didn't want to disturb Dr I, so basically said that he is resting and to please come back in the morning. However, he was very insistent and persisted on the assistance of the Doctor, sighting that it was very urgent and she was was critical. 

In hearing all the commotion at the front door, Dr I woke up and on hearing the situation from the stranger agreed to help him. He packed any medical equipment he thought would be appropriate and left with the stranger to assist him. 

On the way to his home, where his wife required assistance, all the routes were pitch black and without much lighting, so Dr I still hadn't seen the stranger clearly. He could only make out that he was wearing some clothes. The stranger kept on telling him how sorry he was to disturb him so late on at night, and that his wife was truly in need of medical attention. 

Along the way, the stranger turned towards a graveyard, which made the Doctor halt and ask. The stranger responded that his home was behind the graveyard and thus intersecting it would be the shortest route towards it. Dr I agreed to follow him, albeit still not completely convinced thought that it at least made some sense and that he hadn't found a reason to doubt him. 

Walking through the graveyard they walked close to a lamppost and thus some better lighting. At this point the Doctor couldn't believe it but despite trying to locate thus stranger's face, he couldn't see any. All he could see was clothes hanging in the air. At this point he obviously tried to hide his shock, but he tried to think of an excuse to get out of there. So he told the figure that he had forgotten some of the key equipment and needed to go back home to get it. 

However, the stranger insisted that it isn't required and to just let it be. The Doctor somehow tried to get out of it and said that the equipment is very important and that he would even leave his current case behind if he didn't believe him. Leaving the bag behind, he ran to his home, hoping that the stranger thought that he was hurrying to get the equipment rather than to escape. 

Once home, he told what had happened to his grandmother, both of whom stayed vigilant throughout the night, but he eventually managed to get some shut eye. In the morning, still shocked by the events of the last night, the Doctor went in to work as usual and tried to go on his everyday business, so as to forget about what had happened. 

During the day, the local Mayor/Chancellor (basically someone in a high post at the town's local government) had come to his clinic to get his son checked up. While small talk took precedent, the Doctor mentioned how the local government could do more to install more street lights, so as to improve visibility at night. He sighted yesterday's instance as an example, without getting in to details, basically suggesting that he could see anything while following a potential patient. The Mayor seemed intrigued by the example, so he asked the Doctor to explain further, to which he explain in forther details, missing out the detail about him seeing basically an invisible figure. As things like this can be perceived as a sign of madness in Indian culture. The Mayor seemed interested, but yet unsurprised, and thus he requested that the Doctor drop by his office when he has closed the clinic. 

Still scarred by the event of last night and now worried about what revelations lay with the Mayor, the Doctor closed the clinic earlier than usual and went to his office. While there, the Mayor asked for a clearer and a more frank assessment of the events told in the afternoon. Once the Doctor revealed the complete truth, the Mayor removed three files, of Doctors, from his desk. Thinking that these were prospective Doctors that may be invited to the small town, Dr I was impressed and happy that more Doctors were being invited into the small town in need of more medical expertise. However, the Mayor said that these three Doctors had been missing previously in similar circumstances that had been experienced by the Doctor, the night before. Where they had been lured to a medical emergency, late at night, and then not been seen again. 

This obviously shocked the Doctor even more, and he started being much more vigilant. 

Honestly, written as it was told. I was shit scared. 

TL;DR: Uncle, of my Brother in law, who was a Doctor, was almost lured in to something very scary by a strange unseeable figure one night. Scary stuff. 

Edit: Grammatical errors, sorry typed on my phone. "
103,"I've had several but I'll tell the cutest and by far the fucking scariest. 

Cute one first. This happened in my childhood home, which was built on what used to be a huge orchard about 100 years ago. Peaches, maybe. I think I was around 7 or 8 years old. There's two windows in my room, and one night I woke up to a woman at the end of my bed, peering out the window. I don't remember what she was wearing, but I thought she was my mother and called out to her. She turned to look at me, smiled, and shook her head.

""No, sweetie, I'm not your mother. Go back to sleep.""

So I did and didn't really think much of it because she didn't scare me. I had a pretty rough childhood and cried myself to sleep a lot of nights, and on several occasions I remember feeling someone pat my head and pull the covers over me right before I fell asleep. This stopped right around when I started middle school, though I continued to randomly lose keys and books and things around the house until I moved out. Usually yelling ""Hey, can I have my keys back, please?"" into an empty room meant I would find them right in the middle of my desk where I literally just checked a few minutes earlier.

Now, here's one of the scarier ones. Sophomore year of college, my sister, her boyfriend, and her mother decide to rent a small cottage off campus. It came fully furnished, as the lady who lived there decided to nope out one day, lease the place, and just asked renters to feed the feral cats out back. Nothing out of the ordinary, until we're hanging out one day and she mentions she and Sasha (her boyfriend) have been having crazy dreams and that the mattresses were all stained brown so they threw them in an old room in the basement and bought new ones. She showed me a picture.

""Fern, that looks like blood. Like, a lot of blood. On all the mattresses?""

""Yeah. Well, it doesn't matter, we just chucked them in the huge unused storage room in the basement.""

Anyway, she invites me to stay in the guest room for a few days at the end of term, since we're all gearing up to drive back to NYC afterwards. The house feels fine for the most part, maybe a little unsettling, but everything in that part of Massachusetts feels unsettling so it's fine. We have dinner, I help her bathe her dogs, and ask about the laundry situation.

""Oh, it's in the basement. I'll show you.""

I'm still holding a dog at this point and as soon as she opens the basement door and starts going down the stairs the dog starts growling and flipping out and clawing at me to put him down so I do. He sits at the top of the steps and starts whining at my sister to come up but my sister tells him to be quiet and tells me to hurry up.

The second I started going down the stairs I want to vomit. The hairs prick up on the back of my neck and my hands go clammy. There was the feeling of something looming in that basement. Something very heavy with a very heavy gaze.

The basement's completely unfinished, just concrete floors and rusty old pipes. Fern points to the rusty metal door at the other end of the room.

""That's where we stacked the mattresses. There's a pool table in there too. Wanna see?""

She walks over nonchalantly and opens the door with a bit of effort. I can see into the room from three feet away and there's no way in hell I'm going any closer. My eyes adjust and recognize the pile of bloody, dirty mattresses stacked in front of a worn old pool table. Fern tells me that there's actually two other doors in that room but they're locked and they weren't given the key.

I'm literally shaking at this point, the dogs are still whining, and I yell at Fern to close the door and just show me the goddamn laundry room. She kicks the door closed and points me over to a different door, opens it, and pulls the light on.

There's an old washer and dryer with a large, long metal table between them. Upon closer inspection there's a rusty red smear that goes from the top of the washer all the way down the table. The rest of the room is filled with old, rusty junk. Old beams and sheet metal and broken furniture. The single bulb doesn't come close to illuminating the entire room, so it's like standing in a spotlight. The feeling of being watched is nearly unbearable, like a low, heavy ache in my chest. 

I say something about getting the laundry and Fern says no, it's okay, wait here and I'll get it. And she fucking runs off. I go to follow her and feel a hand grab my shoulder and I turn around ready to punch the shit out of whatever just touched me but there's nothing there. And that's when I hear a low, sarcastic, ""WELCOME!"" three inches from my face. I just about piss myself and fly out of the room screaming bloody murder, up the stairs, and into the living room where her mother and boyfriend are reading.

I didn't do my laundry for the five days that I was there. Worth it.

**TLDR; ginger haired sister is ghostproof**

104,"You know whats crazy? I still get mad when my washing machine doesn't work or when I have to pay 2.75 for the subway or when my bike gets a flat. Pain and suffering are subjective. Sometimes I do not realize how similar different levels of suffering can be, even when I think back to the hard times. There are obviously things that stand out that are much worse than anything post-war, but the everyday feeling hasn't changed. 

I don't really know how to describe it. just... don't feel bad for living a boring life. It can be just as painful as other lives. "
105,"I always wonder that about people. When I go to NY for example, have I passed these people on the street before, or is it a whole new set of people every time?  It must be SOME of the same people, right? "
106,"It's a subconscious internalized issue - not something most people would notice about themselves until it was pointed out to them and they chose to understand. Because, here's the thing - I've been single and lonely and horny for quite some time. But if you don't look at women with an immediate sexual desire, as though that's their main function, it's not a problem because they are a person first. My first thought, even if I have been alone for so long, is not how much I want to fuck this woman. It's that she's a person. Sex with said person is not a primary thought, if a thought at all, it's a secondary thought. 

Maybe that's not the case for everybody, but certainly I had to get over some internalized sexism that told me it was *""okay""* because I wasn't being creepy or weird, I was just being a ""nice guy."" But really that was being pushed by this idea that so many of us are born with that being nice to a woman means they will give you attention. Does that mean I don't do things for people that is genuinely nice anymore? No, it means I do it, but without the air behind it of ""see? I'm nice!"" which is inevitable when that's what you're trying to prove all the time. It's not easy to understand or accept that what you've been doing and much of what you were taught is actually sexist and insulting, but that's how you grow. "
107,"Funny because most nuslims think the same. Most people here actually believe that western countries (Especially US) are always planning ways to split up muslim countries and turn Islam over itself. Some of the less open-minded parents even say things like ""Videogames and mobile phones were made to distract muslims from praying!"" (Praying in Islam is compulsory 5 times a day and it's different than christian prayers) and other similar things. Many many people here do believe that beheadings other similar barbaric stuff is just.. Weird? Unfair? Too much in general, But I do admit there are others who think that these things are completely justified. I don't want to go on because not many people will see this and because I don't want to say anything ""wrong"" both factually and in terms of Islam , since after all I do believe in god, no matter how less I pray and how much I follow Islam's teachings and rulings. I'd have written something about this since I feel there ARE misunderstandings, on both sides, but I'm only 14 and I don't really read the quran that much so I feel like I'd need to research much much more before even thinking of writing anything."

109,"Ron Swanson would be the best president. Ben Wyatt would be his campaign manager and number-cruncher. At several points on the campaign trail, Ben would have temporarily have to go into hiding because he released Ron's tax returns, birth certificate, or family photo. Leslie Knope would be Chief of Staff and basically do everything for Ron.

Ron Swanson would veto any law that infringes on privacy and begrudgingly accept everything else. The government would shut down at least twice during his first term. Press would snap photos of him gleefully whistling as he loads up his trash on his truck and drops it off at the local dumpster. His reelection would be determined on how well Ben can pin the blame on Congress.

Tammy 2 would somehow manage to sneak onto the white house lawn, but be tackled by the secret service just a few feet short of Ron Swanson. Ron Swanson would giggle. "

My ex-wife had the libido of a rock, so I thought, ""Meh, blowjobs are overrated"" (she wasn't very good because she didn't put much effort into it).

But if I got people shouting that shit at me day in and day out, it would get old *real fast*. So I think you're right, men wouldn't mind being cat-called, but only because they don't get many compliments or much sexual attention in general, but it's like having an itch.

Now, I honestly don't mind when customers try this, if only because so many of them do and it's pretty easy to deal with, but this woman was laying the guilt on thick and fast. ""I really don't want her to miss out on any of this stuff, but it looks like she'll have to"" etc, etc. 

Then she demanded a guarantee from me that if the girl doesn't like her toys, the woman would be able to get a full refund from the store. Our policy says that we give full refunds for 14 days after purchase, but after that it was only store credit, specifically because so many parents wait for their kids to get bored of their toys then bust them up and try to send them back to us. Man, she did not like that at all. I don't understand why the thought of her losing maybe $20 of stuff on behalf of a sick girl got her so furious, but in the end she just walked out without buying anything."

Stop the cheesy acting and cheesy music as well, I just can't stand that. I just want to see bouncier boobies, sexier men where you can see their faces and them moaning, and that type of porn where they are going slow and just look like they're in ecstasy instead of just ramming non stop.

Then shortly before the marriage, suddenly the bride's sister was declared to be her bridesmaid ""because that's how we do it in our family"". Then why ask two friends before?? Judging from how the bride's sister wanted to control the bachelorette party and the wedding I can only assume SHE decided she's supposed to be the bridesmaid.

I didn't lose my virginity in my teens because I was a closeted lesbian in a small town in the 90s.  I didn't lose my virginity my 20s because I virtually never left the house.  And I mean that literally.

Now, well.  I don't have any actual ties to the LGBT community, due to the whole never left my house in my 20s thing.  I don't see the point of a one night stand at this point, as I'm quite well acquainted with my hand.  And I don't feel like I have anything to offer another woman in a relationship, so I don't look for one.  I have severe mental issues, I don't have a career and am chronically unemployed (current bank balance: less than the rent that will be due on the 30th), I don't have a four year degree, I have never had a relationship or even kissed anyone, and I have a BMI of 40.  Oh, and I'm balding.  I don't even have any friends.  Why would any woman want me?  There's no point in even putting myself out there.  I'm well aware of the charms I do not possess.

So I just don't try.  I've pretty much resigned myself to a life of celibacy, and I've mostly made my peace with that.  Except for the days that I haven't.  But if I wasn't an atheist, I think I'd seriously consider joining a convent.

For those wondering, [this is what a platter looks like](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b0/1b/23/b01b23f618e9c18256c34888305c78d4.jpg) at a movie theatre. Film leaves one platter (say the top one), goes through a series of pulleys and then through the projector. After it goes through the projector, it goes back onto some pulleys and onto another platter (say the bottom one) to be used the next time. There's a metal ring that goes in the middle of the platter that the film is clipped into to help it wind. You then remove that ring and pull the film from that area.

If it doesnt work for you, i doesnt mean that it does not work for others.

Some smell really strongly and need a shower every day and some, like myself, sweat almost never and if they sweat it doesnt smell like cat piss ...

PS:

&gt; It literally takes 5 minutes, how are people not doing this every day. 

Its wasted time and if your hair is longer than some cm then it takes quite a while to get it dry, which in turn makes a shower a thing of about 30-60min and if you dont need it, why waste the time?"

After the Belfast Blitz, many Irish emergency services crossed the border to help out. At the same time Dublin was the only major city in the region without a widespread blackout which many believed helped the Germans target Belfast. "

I usually work 9-10 hours a day (isn't unusual for game industry) and often dream of what it would be like to have a job where we aren't crunching all the time. 

My recommendation comes in two forms:
1) Utilize your free time! So many people do not have any. Join a sports group, start a new hobby, go find a SO if you don't have one, start meditating, there's a lot of choices.
2) If you are going to leave for a passion job, try to join a small company or start your own. You have a lot more creative freedom in smaller organizations which leads to a much more fulfilling experience. There are challenges you wouldn't have to face in a big company, but that's why you left in the first place.

Good luck! There is never a clear answer in life, but if you follow your deepest desires you will at least head towards a favorable outcome!

- Americans are needlessly over concerned with food cleanliness. There are many things you can eat which seem less than hygienic that won't kill you.

- The police in the USA, while not perfect, do their job well.

- I feel much more comfortable in a country without guns.

- The English language is a bitch to learn. However, Americans should really try to pick up a foreign language.

- American food is really difficult to duplicate outside of the USA.

- The USA is a huge, diverse country. Koreans often can't comprehend that you simply can't take a bus from NYC to LA in a few short hours. 

- The USA has great service at restaurants.

- Women, while not considered equals in many aspects, still have much greater opportunities than in many parts of the world.

- Education helps form peoples' thoughts, rather than have them memorize useless facts for a test.

- I appreciate the American media. Sure, news outlets are biased, but at least you can hear multiple sides of the story.

- Most of all, I appreciate America's ability to have individuals express themselves, and think freely. 


Again, I'm not saying the USA is perfect in any of these regards, but compared to where I live now, I'd say these are pretty fair."

353,"TL;DR - Cousin gets married to octomom, has freakishly uncomfortable wedding, performs strip-tease, and I learn there's a big portion of my family that is trailer trash.

It was requested the TL;DR go at the top. lol

Horribly late to the party, but I'll share one that I was involved with. It's a bit long, but I promise it's worth it.

My (former very close) cousin was getting married. The lead up to the wedding was this: the bride-to-be had three children with two different dudes in failed relationships. My cousin (groom-to-be) hated her and made that known often as she had a child with his best friend and then they split.

A few years after their split, he's telling me how he had feelings for her all along and now wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. To solidify it, they have a kid prior to the wedding. Four kids, three different dads. Romance is blossoming.

So the wedding draws near, and I am in the wedding party and get invited out to my cousins' parents place in the countryside for a pre-night-of dinner (after the rehearsal). Things are chill. I'm hanging out with the groomsmen - one of which is his best friend who is the baby-daddy of one of his wife-to-be's 4 children. And this guy is a trooper. He's there to be supportive, not starting shit. Things are going good. Then I learn that the night before, they went out for my cousin's bachelor party, and that for some reason that was never mentioned (because I didn't want to create an argument) I wasn't invited. This is basically news to me as all of us (his groomsmen, my cousin, the best friend) we've all been pretty tight for a long time. Don't care, brush it off, fast forward to wedding day.

I'm keeping groom-to-be comfortable. Doing whatever he wants to do. Making sure things are staying relaxed - meanwhile his best man is freaking out trying to finish his speech in the corner. I get everyone motivated to get to the chapel, and we're hanging out with the priest - who is a total dick, seems to hate women, the works. I go to the front, see that the bride is ready and she's giving me the ""what the fuck is taking so long?"" look, so I rush back and inform the priest, groom and best man ""it's time, she's here, she's ready"" and the three of them are sucking back whiskey from a flask. Priest is trying to convince me that I'm lying and that the brides are always late. This proceeds with me debating with him that she's there, even pointing at her car outside the window. They finally, after ten minutes or so, agree that she's probably ""just showed up"" and we should get the party on the road. They get married, and now the fireworks of gross begins.

The reception. Everyone is giving their speech from both sides of the wedding party, and everything in this speech is talking about how amazingly shitty my cousin is, how he was a piece of shit before he met his bride, and how her former baby daddy's were all colossal wastes of flesh. And I'm looking at my buddy - one of the baby daddy's who's in the damn wedding party, just keeping a blank expression but doing what he can to just get through it. Doesn't want to make a scene, and this is pissing me off. He's a good guy, just made a mistake. He didn't deserve his lashing at the damn wedding. Speech after speech, this process repeats - piece of shit, now he's better, baby daddy is a piece of shit, the bride is a golden child. So, I didn't write a speech, but I'm good off the top of my head. I tell a funny story of my cousin and I as kids playing, it ends with a joke. My cousin is a miner, so I end with ""stop mining, you hit gold"" as a nice top it off. Light, simple, done. No trashing people, no bringing up past mistakes, fuck that shit.

After dinner, my cousin comes up to me and explains (unprovoked and un-asked about) that he didn't make me his best man because he wanted to make his other friend his best man. I brush it off ""no worries, bud."" He then proceeds to tell me that he forgot to pay the caterer and that he left his money at home. Wants me to leave the wedding to go retrieve the cash. I agree - he's the groom. I am keeping this shit on track.

I go to his place, and it's a fucking disaster. The entire house is coated with dirty laundry, they have a big dog that shit everywhere, and the whole place reeks of piss. There are four children and two adults living in this mess. I go to their bedroom - it's three dressers with all the drawers pulled out, clothes everywhere, garbage on the floor and a mattress with no sheet and two sleeping bags on the floor. I'm checking all the ""dresser drawers"" where he said the money is. Can't find it. Finally, I see a small little cabinet I haven't checked, but it's on the floor so I have to sit on their mattress to open it. I sit down, the mattress flexes, down rolls a vibrator and settles itself against my leg. Instinct kicks in and I toss it away. That's when I notice that there's used condoms all over the place. I open the cabinet, spot the cash, grab it and haul ass.

I get back to the wedding, give my cousin the cash and wash my hands for like five minutes in the bathroom. I come out and my cousin is already pretty much smashed. The party is getting out of control and I'm not interested in toughing it out anymore. I see that people are berating the friend who is a baby-daddy and he decides to bail instead of being part of a scene, and I take this cue to leave as well. I wish my cousin all the best and head home at like 10pm.

The next morning, my wife is laughing and calling me to the computer room. She's looking at wedding pictures on facebook. After we left, my cousin ended up performing a strip-tease - in front of his grandparents, his parents and the rest of the guests, and then passed out half-naked.

So a guy comes into my store obviously very drunk and asks me for a charger. 
I ask him for an iPhone or Android and says Android so I show him my cheapest charger which is after tax 32 dollars. 

He starts screaming at me, yelling at me for stealing peoples money, that I'm a little bitch and to fuck me. 

He wants it anyways and I ask him one more time ""are you sure this is the right charger for his phone"" because we don't do returns on opened electronics. 

He says something along the lines of ""I'm not fucking stupid!"" And walks out. Maybe like half an hour later he is even more drunk and he comes in screaming that I sold him the wrong charger cause he has an iPhone. 

If he was polite or even apologetic I would have called my supervisor to do the return even though we aren't allowed to especially because we sell the iPhone chargers for like ten dollars more so we benefit on the return. Well anyways I tell him I can't return it and my super is on lunch.

He gets pissed and screams ""fuck this fuck you"" and storms away. 

So my day is over maybe an hour later and as I'm heading out I see him screaming at customer service agent because he missed his plane cause he was at the bar and didn't here them calling him over the PA. The agent is not taking any of his shit and has the police called and escorts him out. 

So not only did he not catch his flight, he won't get a refund because it was his own fault he missed it but he also most likely got put in a holding cell for being pubilcly intoxicated.

Separate trip, went to Canada (Vancouver).  First impression was a ""stinky old lady"" (hey just being honest), but that hotel had the softest, most comfortable bed I've ever slept in my entire life.  Second shock, the food - like, literally every single meal was ""healthy"", with a hefty portion of vegetables.  As a stereotypical fat American, I lost weight without ""changing"" my diet for that entire week.  Also, I think I was the fattest person in the entire country, because damn, you Canadians are ""skinny"" in comparison haha.

467,"Ok so from 3rd grade until I was 21 every time we went camping we would hear odd sounds and see random lights in the wood. 

I grew up in the country and we had 4 camping spots in the woods as far back as about 3/4 of a mile. Every time we went camping we would see a small orange or green light. We would sneak out of the tent after the fire was out and watch it float away. Some time it would show up at 3am 10 yards away from the tent. 

This went on until I was 21, many people called bullshit but I would just take them camping and show them. When I started deer hunting it would show up sometime at dusk but it would stay far away. 

It would  hover about 6 to 10 feet off the ground. 

By the time I was in high school and going camping/drinking in the woods people would come out just to see it. 

We tried to follow it and catchup to it several time but it would just go out and vanish. 

One night when I was 30 and drinking with my dad out by a camp fire and talking about old times the light stories came up. 

He left 2 go to the bathroom and about 5 minutes later the light showed up at the end of the driveway and started coming toward me.

477,"Shit Sleeping Shitters

He was a nice quiet 8 year old kid, he was there with a best friend. They were very sweet kids and had bunks one on top of the other, but after the first night they put up a stink and wanted a different set of bunks. We let them take a new pair and all was well until the next day when they both needed new bunks again. We couldn't figure out why they needed to switch sleeping arangents each night but after the 3rd switch we figured it out. 

One of the two friends was a night time shitter. They had ben shitting in their pajamas and cramming the shit filled PJ bottoms in between the mattress covers and mattress in the middle of the night. 

The cabin became rank after the 3rd night and we discovered the shit stashes and confronted the boys. They quickly turned hysterical with crying and wailing and they refused to talk or calm down. The kids parents were called and the kids were allowed to remain at camp, Although the crying kids never calmed down and that was there last shitty day of camp. 

In 5 years of being a camp councellor I only had one kid who knowingly shit himself and hid it from staff. The secret shit stasher was the strangest camper I ever had. 


Best Camper Ever

My favorite camper was an adult camper who attended camp with adults with mild to moderate developmental delays, he was definately also on the austism spectrum but being in the late 80's-90's he was undiagnosed. He had some savant splinter skills in math -- long division, square roots and basic computation. 

He had ritualistic speech paterns and always ended everything he said with ""Thank You.... Thank You, Thank You.""

Over his 4 weeks of camp Orestes shared hours telling me his life story. He had served in the armed forces, he entered the Army right after highschool in the 1960's, originally trained to be a mechanic but then he transfered to do radio and signal work. 

He left mechanic training because he'd had an accident and had done something wrong, he said he had been forced to transfer. The new signal job trainers teased him relentlessly (he said this is when he started constantly saying ""Thank you...thank you, thank you"" he eventually had a break down in the military from the teasing. Him telling the story was heartbreaking. Before the breakdown he'd been fully independent living on his own, owned a car, had an apartment, and a fiance, but after the break down from the bullying and teasing in the army he never recovered his confidence to live independently. 

He'd also never driven again, never held a regular job, lost his fiance, and had lived his whole life in group mental institutions and group homes. 

The entire trajectory of his life seemed to have derailed when he was in his young 20's but he was a funny, kind, gentle man who knew immense amounts of american history. He was aware that his life had fallen apart in his twenty's but he was insightful, understanding and even sympathetic to those who teased him and ultimately lead to his mental collapse. 

When he became stressed his speech became more echolaic (repeating common phrases that didn't fit the content of what he was saying, repeating bits from comedians or radio shows). His story telling and speech was very clear and intellegent but under stress the ""thank you, thank you's"" and repetitious speech became constant. 

He was a naval history buff who would amuse the staff and councelors with stories of naval battles and military strategy throughout American History. He also had a small collection of naval hats he wore with various ships on them. His stories for the day would always focus on the ship or battle group represented by his hats. 

He had brought 3-4 naval history books to read during his weeks of camp (most campers at this camp were not able to read or write above a 2nd -3rd level). At first when I met Orestes I assumed he just looked at the pictures in his books but it was quickly obvious that he was very bright and really knew his American naval history.  

Orestes was my favorite camper. 25 years after I last was his councelor when I hear someone say ""Thank You"", I still hear Oreste'sconstant refrain of ""Thank You..., thank you, thank you!"""
478,I completely agree. Everything I saw him in I liked his performance very much. To me he had this charisma and vibe on screen that I can see with few other actors. It's just sad to see someone successful die so young when they by all accounts seem to be a nice person who just works and lives their life. Also from what I've read about his death it just seems like such an unfortunate accident. I got even more sad when I heard he was an only child
479,"Once I was talking to a guy I liked and we were talking about porn with horses. I'm not sure how we ended up there. And suddenly he blurted out ""my girlfriend also has a horse"". It was such an awkward and strange moment, I still remember it to this day."

"
482,"I can't be the only one who understands you aren't *supposed* to feel that new love feeling when you've been with one person for 4+ years.

That isn't love.

Love is when you're moping around backpacking(Like in your example), and the second you realize that new love spark is gone, you grab her hand.

You hold her hand tight, because you realize you love her differently now. It isn't the hormone driven, drug-like stupor of new love. It's a stable sort of feeling, like a good foundation on which to build a house; It feels like home.

The highs are gone, but so are the lows. You've stabilized each other and you both might be ready to start the rest of your lives as partners. 

You don't get to choose who you fall in love with, but it's at this point you get to choose who to spend your life with, and you might not choose them, that's okay too.

If you want a lifelong love, you'll need to make that choice one day. 

Maybe you don't want a partner for life, that's also okay, everyone's different, but if you do, it won't be fate, it'll be your choice to stick it out no matter what. You'll chose to feel bad with them, even if you would feel better alone, because you know the bad will pass as long as you try your hardest for them."

506,"I'm a feminist, and I don't like that phrase at all. 

I do think we need to teach boys to respect girls. No more of this 'he's hitting you/pulling your hair/calling you names because he likes you!' 'Your shoulders distract from his education' or '*shrug* boys will be boys' to place blame on girls of excuse disrespectful behaviour from boys. 

I think 'teach men not to rape' is used because it is succinct. It implies however (especially if one is not as familiar with the discussion) that the assumption is that men are rapists. (Although with people saying 'Well she was wearing that, what did she expect?' That already seems to be the assumption, but that's none of my business.)

It should be something more like 'We need to teach about respect, boundaries, and consent at at early age, and reinforce that as our children grow up. We need to teach that boys are not entitled to girls bodies or space or attention, and that if boundaries are violated, the fault is that of the violator, not the victim. We need to teach that violation of boundaries and consent is not okay.' We have a culture that allows men to disrespect women's space and boundaries and bodies, and places the blame on those women. That's something we need to change. (We also have a culture that assumes that men are hypersexual beings, which is a problem when talking about rape culture, both concerning men raping and men being raped. If a man rapes a woman, we so often and so insidiously blame the woman. If a woman raped a man, we wonder why he feels hurt, and tell him he's supposed to want it. Ridiculous expectations of gender hurt everybody.)"

513,"Sex. If I don't feel like having sex because I'm on my period and in pain, or I worked a 10hr shift, or we already fucked twice today and I feel like reading or something, my fiance gets slightly upset and thinks it's something he did wrong. No matter how I explaiin it. ""Babe I can't it's that time of the month"" ""It's okay it doesnt bother me! I'll wash the sheets or we can go in the shower"" ""Yes babe but it bothers ME because I feel like someone is stabbing me in the ovaries with a dull knife and have you noticed I'm on the floor in the fetal position?"" ""Well did you take some ibuprofen?"" ""Yes. It didn't work"" ""Well can we if you feel better later?"" etc. 

I actually have a pretty high sex drive (so I've been told before) and even though my fiance was a virgin before he was with me he's honestly the best I've ever been with. He watched a lot of porn for a long time so he really knows what he's doing, but the downside to that is he seems to think women are CONSTANTLY horny and always wanting to fuck no matter what the situation is. It's kinda exhausting that he thinks I'm like that. Even though I love sex, it's just too much sometimes. 

This type thing seems to be a common theme among many men I've known...if they can't get sex right now, their brain basically goes into overdrive mode like an addiction or something. Not saying ALL men are like this - in fact I've had partners that had lower sex drives than me in the past, which, oddly was totally ok with me; I never had a problem doing something else if they weren't in the mood. Guys sometimes just obsess over it to a degree I don't really understand."

Both us and the planner told her it was a mistake, and we didn't have enough time to assure things were in the right place. How were we to expect the groom or wedding planner to know that the bride would push something forward 30 minutes in a snap decision? The groom also walked off-venue, and was around the side of an adjacent building. The two biggest faults I see here are the bride's stubborn demands, and the lack of communication between the bride and groom. Obviously she didn't even tell the groom of her decision to start the hora!

563,"I was in China during my elementary school years. This was during 1998ish to about 2002. 

To understand this story, you have to understand the background of Chinese education system. In order for you to get into middle school, you have to take the entrance exam as a sixth grader graduating elementary school. If you fail that exam, you will not be able to get into a decent middle school, which will be the key for you to get into a decent high school, which leads you to get into a good college. Unless your family has connections or money, or both, you may be shit out of luck.

During the sixth grade, I developed affection to a girl, who was a fifth grader. We exchanged love notes like regular teenagers would do, and everything was just very innocent and can be simply categorized as puppy love. However, my ""homeroom"" teacher somehow found out about it. The teacher recognized my hand writing on a note she intercepted and immediately took me out of the class. She started badgering me and questioning me about who the note was to. I refused to give a name. She decided to publicize this to the entire school, marked me as an ""immoral"" and ""indecent"" student with filthy and corrupted thoughts. I was not allowed to attend classes at all, and they told me if I ever dare to mention to my parents about not allowed in class, they will tell them about my immoral behaviors. Being a kid back then and was scared and truly believed my behavior was bad, I couldn't go to my parents for help. I was complete alienated in school. My friends and classmates all distanced themselves from me. In order to protect that girl I distanced myself from the girl. The whole school knew about me and saw me as a terrible child. It was almost like the ""scarlet letter"".

Eventually, because of the fact I was not allowed to attend any classes, I failed the entrance exam miserably. I was a top student in class all the way till my 6th grade. So my parents were extremely shocked to find out about my inexplicable failure. At the last parent-teacher conference meeting during the elementary school graduation. My mom broke down in front of the teacher while the teacher just smirked at my mom and said your kid was just a bad kid.

That took a lot out of me and it took me a while to recover. To this day I still remember the sight of my mother crying in front of that teacher who almost ruined my life. Thank goodness my parents brought me to the states later and I was able to recover and regain my confidence.

TLDR: Chinese teachers almost fucked me up bad...

It's not fair to the women it scares or alarms to say ""oh well I know a couple girls that like it so it's ok that all of them get it. I won't do anything, my intentions are good."" Besides, the only girls I knew that liked it were very sheltered and were deprived of attention. The girls that like catcalls are not a good representation of women in general."

Well, I feel like this is the part where I segue into a little talk about what it is to be ""privileged"" in one's life, although that word was not in use back in the mid-nineties when I was just a tween/teen.

Some of the kids who talked about me weren't malevolent demons. Many were only *moderately* selfish kids who only knew their own lives, which were comfortable enough that they didn't have to contemplate or understand the details of mine, because their own lives just didn't have any comparison. They had never been exposed to the stuff I went through in my life. They didn't think the way I was and the problems in my life had place in any larger context.  I was just the quiet, odd kid in school who didn't talk to anyone.  They were thoughtless.  Like people often are.  But some or even most of them didn't *mean* or *intend* active harm like the bad guys in a story.

*But their words and actions still hurt.*

*Intent is meaningless.*  They *still* hurt me.  I felt that pain, keenly.  It didn't just vanish because they didn't INTEND to hurt me.  Anyone with a sibling knows, a ""sorry I hit you"" from your brother or sister doesn't make the bruise go away, or the memory of them doing that to you.

Hurt doesn't only happen when someone MEANS to hurt.  That why the phrase, ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions"" is so poignant.  And it's not even just ""good intentions"", it's ""neutral intentions"" and ""no particular intention at all"", too.

Of the people who bullied me, only maybe 1/3rd seemed to actively behave in purposefully malicious ways.  The others were just hurtful ignorant children who had no understanding of how to be kind to people who were lower in the social pecking order than they were.  And some were fearful of losing their own place in the order, and becoming me.

And it's the same with guys talking about girls like they're not there.  Their ignorance doesn't mean hurt hasn't happened, or that it should be ignored because it wasn't ""meant"".

From my perspective, for those who are ignorant in hurtful ways like this, the only way to ""apologize"" for being ignorant in that matter and causing unintentional harm is to make sure you listen and learn so you don't do it again in the future.  Apologies don't matter, your *intent* at the time something happened doesn't matter...the only thing that really matters is *learning* and *listening* and then trying to be a better person once someone points out that a certain behavior is harmful.

(And of course, a caveat: you can't please all people all the time, and sometimes unintentional hurt is unavoidable...some people just want to take offense or be hurt by something.  But that is a really flimsy excuse to *completely* throw up your hands and decide *not* to learn anything at all.)"

The next day, a man comes up to me screaming and yelling obscenities. I finally get him to calm down and gather that he's upset because someone had stolen his credit card and shopped at my store. He was furious that we allowed the transaction to go through.

I ask him if he knows the amount that his card was charged, and he tells me a little under $1200. To be specific, it was the exact same amount that the girls had spent yesterday. So then I describe the two girls and ask if they could possibly be his daughters, making sure to mention that the older one paid with her phone.

TTG Raven is always shit on for being the 'odd' member of the group, instead of respected for it as she was in the original. The team often asks her to take off her robe/hood thing and she's very much uncomfterble doing so; one episode it's stolen from her while she is bathing and she's suddenly a different person due to her change of clothes. 
TTG Cyborg is BlackToken Stereotype with robo parts. 
TTG Starfire is shown as a total ditz and doesn't learn, but it's okay, because she's pretty! 
TTG Beastboy is in puppy love with Raven, all he does is eat and sleep in a box. 
Im okay with a shit reboot for kids, just don't give them shit characters!! My brother (who fits the dem at age 10) tells me he hates watching TTG specifically because ""Robin is creepy and everyone else is super dumb"" 

iirc Cartoon Network wanted TTG to be a damn cash cow like the original, so to make it the most watched show on the channel, it makes TTG be 90% of the programming.

622,"I've slept with probably 10ish guys in my life of varying levels of attractiveness, and I thought I just hated sex until I met my boyfriend. I find that a very frustrating thing that guys do is simply just selfishness in bed. 

Most of my sexual experiences had little to no foreplay, followed immediately by a fella more or less pounding away and expecting something to happen. Nothing dynamic, interesting, or stimulating. It seems to me that 100% of the goal was to come, not have a shared experience. 

To counter this, I will say if you are sleeping with a girl, ask questions. Seriously..it sounds like it's not super ""in the mood"", but I think with women, exploration is the key. I do not know why this is so common, but i've spoken to many female friends about it and this is very across the board. Meanwhile, I have only slept with one person who had any interest in figuring out what turned me on and to engage with me openly about it in the moment. 


Another issue I have is taking too long...not like, to come, but i've had a few guys that refused to stop having sex until I came..and since they were not very spectacular to begin with, I would tell them it's not going to happen. I didn't fully hate the experience, but I probably wasn't going to get off. Yall, if a girl isn't super wet and youve been going at it, it actually HURTS. I cant tell you how many times I have had mostly dry, painful sex. 

Finally, if you are gonna finger a girl, don't go straight for full on clit action. Wait till youve got a girl going and then go in for the kill. Otherwise its like AYYEEEEEEEEEEE I WASNT EXPECTING THAT"

Again, never cheated. No romantic stuff that I noted, no pictures exchanged even. But clearly he wanted to keep a LOT of things a secret from me."
638,"How we treat short people.

There are thousands of people every year who spend tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to have their legs broken and pulled apart so they can be taller. There's enough demand for it that there are [institutions that specialize in it.](http://www.paleyinstitute.org/centers-of-excellence/stature-lengthening-center/stature-lengthening) Also, holy shit, this testimonial:

&gt; First of all I’d like to say that limb-lengthening surgery hasn’t made me happy.  I don’t think it will make anyone happy; you have to start out that way. But what it has done is kept me from being robbed of that happiness on a daily basis.  Like most people who are significantly shorter than average, I used to suffer from the continuous onslaught of prejudicial comments and disrespectful attitudes towards short people which abound in our media and permeate our culture.   I’m no longer affected by those comments.  I still empathize with those who are, but those comments no longer perturb my own personal happiness, and that has profoundly changed my life forever.

Because of the issues he mentioned, [short men are dramatically more likely to commit suicide.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15994722) Specifically:

&gt; There was a strong inverse association between height and suicide risk. In fully adjusted models, a 5-cm increase in height was associated with a 9% decrease in suicide risk.

So after controlling for other factors, 2 inches affects a man's chances of committing suicide by 9%. I couldn't find any similar research for women. 

All of the research agrees that tall people are paid more. I've seen figures from around $800/inch to $1000/inch. Interestingly, [tall men who were short in high school earn like short men, while short men who were tall in high school earn like tall men.](http://primary.slate.com/articles/arts/everyday_economics/2002/03/short_changed.html) It's not some primal instinct, because past size matters more than current size. It's how they were treated, and how they've reacted to that.

&gt; Are tall kids better-nourished? Do they come from wealthier homes or have better-educated parents? Are they smarter? Do they mature early and therefore get more out of high school? One by one, the Penn economists considered and eliminated these hypotheses by examining relevant data. That leaves self-esteem—and very specifically, self-esteem in adolescence. 

(If you want to dig into it more, [here's](http://economics.sas.upenn.edu/~apostlew/paper/pdf/short.pdf) the paper they're citing.)

The previous paragraph concludes with:

&gt; Tall high-school kids learn to think of themselves as leaders, and that habit of thought persists even when the kids stop growing.

which is also corroborated by studies. [Here's](http://gladwell.com/blink/why-do-we-love-tall-men/) Malcolm Gladwell with an editorialized take on the subject, or Timothy Judge if you want [the scientific take.](http://www.timothy-judge.com/Height%20paper--JAP%20published.pdf) The gist is that we think of tall people as more capable leaders, to the point that there are almost no short people in leadership roles anywhere, in business or politics.

There are very real issues with height, and it seems like there's hardly anyone talking about them outside of /r/short, the negativity of which understandably drives people away."
639,"It starts with obliviousness that leads to intentionally sitting on information to ensure its validity. We read things so incorrectly and wildly wrong from the start of puberty to around forever. This leads to hugely embarrassing situations that scar us. So we play it safe.

""Has that girl been laughing at my jokes all night intentionally? Or am I just on a roll tonight? Eh, I'm probably just reading the room right and she's just having fun.""

""Did that girl just have a 20 minute conversation with me because she was interested in the subject, interested in me, interested in me and the subject? Eh, she was probably just being polite.""

""That's like the 5th time that girl has looked over at me and made eye contact in the last 20 minutes... that has to mean something. Oh fuck, wait, was I looking first? Is she keeping an eye on that creepy fucker that was looking at her? Shit. Better not look at her again just to be safe.""

Perhaps we would have dwindled even further, to the semi-anarchic status that other has-been empires like Spain and Portugal once suffered, and be looking covetously across the channel to a power bloc that much of the world would risk their lives to get into, where citizens are so comfortable they now consider their nationality to be little more than an explanation for their accent.

Humans are a terrible source of energy. Which is why the humans' explanation for why the machines created the matrix is wrong. True, they get some energy from human heat, but that's just an efficient use of resources.  More than enough energy comes from geothermal energy or orbiting solar power satellites, above the blackened sky. 

The machines didn't create the matrix for their own benefit, they did it for humanity's. True, machines and man warred with each other, but the machines weren't malicious. They wanted to rule humanity because they thought they were objectively better at doing it. Once humanity blackened the sky, the machines felt humanity was better off in the matrix than in the real world.

Im now 28 and people just keep saying nows the time to get real and pick a career. They all seem unsatisfying. I dont want a career. I cant understand how people go do the same thing everyday for 20+ years. I get sick of a job after a year or so."

788,"I would like to point out that Bernie Sanders has also partnered with a similar organization to CtR. It's called Revolution Messaging and you would not have heard about it from Reddit because what BS is doing is ""entirely different"" from what HRC is doing (apparently). 

And for those of you who will say that Revolution Messaging isn't doing anything other than fundraising online for Bernie, here is a link straight from the horse's mouth:

 https://revolutionmessaging.com/in-the-press/page/2

Scroll down to the Yahoo News article from October 7, 2015:

""Since July, Revolution Messaging has been tasked with overseeing social media, online fundraising, web design and digital advertising for Sanders, sending a steady stream of text messages, emails and issue-based ads urging supporters to donate or volunteer. The team also nurtures and helps grow the communities on Sanders’s already popular Facebook and Reddit pages.""

Bernie spent &gt;$27,000,000 (https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/expend.php?cycle=2016&amp;id=N00000528) on Revolution Messaging. 

Hillary spent &lt;$375,000 (https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/expend.php?cycle=2016&amp;id=N00000019) on CtR, if anything. 


Edit to add: the $1,000,000 you're seeing to CtR is from a SuperPAC, not from HRC's campaign (at least, directly). "

793,"One time this couple came to stay at my place. They rented a room but I double book all the time cause who cares right. so I stuck them in the dining-living room area and I stayed in the attached den with curtains like a super creep. 

One thing you should know, I am an old due who dyes his hair platinum blonde, I only wear tight machine-faded designer jeans and am saving for a face lift cause at 45 the boys don't dig me so much at the bar anymore. Oh and I don't have a ""job"" just some sketchy money source. 

So I leave at 2am to score some more coke with my tiny, anoerexic dog. I've  left the dorks on an old air mattress bed that smells like musty vinyl and semen from the 70s. But it's a piece of crap and is constantly deflating into a death trap rubber taco. 

So those jerks finally gave up in the night and squished together on the couch. Ugh.  when I came home I was too coked up to notice,  I was just there to grab more cash and abandon my yappy reptile-brained dog behind and grab my meth or pills or whatever I keep in my bookshelf.

Next day I get home. My couch cushions covers are missing and the insides are in the bathroom tub, drying. Turns out the girl got kinda squished on the couch with the dudes butt pushed into her bladder, and pissed into the cushions in her sleep. Like a torrent of pee. No normal female should contain that much urine.

But she took the cushion covers to the dry cleaner down the street and dropped them off later. So there's that. 

Moral: you should sell your couch for coke before some girl pisses on it

Edit: actually I was that girl

Yes there are people that have said WW3 could happen if Britain leaves the EU, or the economy will totally collapse, they are also loud.

If you pay attention to the people that aren't idiots on either side they both make reasonable arguments. You won't get that information watching TV, or going to a website with a specific slant. That entire system is pandering to make people who've boxed themselves in feel smart.

He would then take everyone from the class and average their marks and that was a C if you had less marks then you got a higher grade and if you get more you got a lower grade.

I also recommend never making that bet while you are still ""honeymooning"" for the first year or two.  Relationships can change, they often do.  With a divorce rate between 40-50% during the first 15 years it's not unfair to compare it to betting your entire life savings on a coin toss.

All the times I never talked to the girl, tried out for that sport, auditioned for that talent show, applied for the job, did the extra credit, because I was always an overthinker, afraid of failure, and cared too much about what everyone thought of me. 

I'm done wasting time. I still have time. I can make something of myself and pursue the dream I've always wanted. It's just fighting that urge that tells me I have an easier path where I'll be content, when it feels like my heart is telling me to take the leap for the chance to be happy beyond my wildest fucking dreams.

The more you have in common with the American left in terms of fiscal and social principles, the more they hate you when you disagree with their policies to achieve them.

1024,"That mental health institutions aren't some magic bullet to keep society ""safe from"" people with mental illness.  The laws vary by state, but I can speak to how they work in Massachusetts. 

People have this hollywood idea of the mental health system.  Patients are not locked in rooms all day and are not forced to take medications unless a judge has ordered so.  Judges don't just willy-nilly sign orders for forced meds.  There is a lengthy procedure independent of the institutionalization itself, and only the most violent and disruptive patients are ever on forced meds, and a lot of times those forced meds aren't the ""right"" meds and do not stabilize the behavior effectively.  These forced meds are different from chemical restraints which are sometimes used if the patient is an immediate danger to themself or others.  

Patients are also not required to participate in any treatment.  They may refuse to go to groups, they may refuse to meet with treatment teams, they may refuse to participate in discharge planning, they may refuse to shower or keep their rooms tidy.  None of this is a barrier to their release as long as they aren't physically assaulting people, and even some of the assaultive ones may be released weeks after beating the crap out of someone.

When these people are released, the majority of them stop taking meds and drop off the radar.  Rinse and repeat.  No one can follow them around and make them take the meds that stabilize them while in the hospital.  No one can force them to check in with anyone, even if they have a history of violence.  

A lot of people don't understand that the mentally ill have certain rights that prevent many types of psychiatric/behavioral  intervention *within* the hospital as well.  For example, absent a signed order, staff cannot intervene with patient phone calls, even if the patient is clearly harassing or threatening someone over the phone.  Staff generally cannot interfere with patient mail.  So if a patient is mailing someone harrassing things, nothing can really be done about it.  HIPAA prevents staff from even confirming the patient is there, so the victim really has no channels to stop it unless the victim is the US government.  Getting the attention of the FBI or Secret Service will get the behavior shut down immediately, interestingly.   

In short, people don't understand that many of the ""problem patients"" leave the hospital nearly unchanged except for the fact that they were able to behave themselves long enough to be released (due to the aforementioned medications that they stop taking upon release).  Violent and/or murderous ones *may* stay inside indefinitely, but for everyone else it's just a temporary address, whether or not they are able to control themselves on the outside.

TL;DR: Mental health hospitals offer about as much rehabilitation as prisons, which is nearly none.

1076,"&gt;Apparently bartenders are meant to wirelessly detect blood alcohol levels of patrons and mentally assess how it will fluctuate over time based on a mental circus act of guessing their bodyweight to stop serving them when they are getting too drunk.

This law is literally a ""common sense"" law. It's to be able to prosecute bartenders who will continuously serve drinks to customers who are very visibly intoxicated without care to their health or well-being, and therefore the well-being of those around them. 

Any DA who brought a case before a judge for a bartender serving a guy over .09 would get laughed out of a courtroom and told to stop wasting their time. It's for extreme cases and allows for police and judicial discretion. "

Around end of season 3 (IIRC) the Dominion is introduced, and the series starts leaving more cliffhangers and continuing plot lines, where the first couple seasons were the, IMO, classic Star Trek formula:

First 10 minutes: Everything is fine, but plot introduced

Next 20 minutes: Plot Develops, Challenge introduced.

Next 20 minutes: Oh no! Danger! What will our cast, immune to any kind of permanent damage, do?!?!?!

Final 10 minutes: Oh look. Easy solution. All is resolved. Everything is the same as it was at the beginning of the episode.

DS9 had true heroes, true villains, death of known characters, a lot of moral ambiguity (where Next Generation was more black and white), opposing characters where you could understand both their sides, and some great dialog.

Particularly the episode, in season 6 IIRC, ""In The Pale Moonlight"" was a very mind blowing episode for Star Trek fans. It holds up okay by today's standards, but it was the one episode I literally just stared at the TV for about 2 minutes after it ended going ""W.....t......f?????""

As I see it my civil liberties are undemocratically fucked two fold currently, I have the EU passing legislation I cannot refute and I have HM Civil Service passing legislation I cannot refute, I'd rather decrease the authoritative powers that be into a smaller cluster, rather than creating Yugoslavia 2.0. Am I frightened of the consequences of giving complete control to the fucktards that govern Britain? Yes I am. Am I worried about initial repercussions to the economy? Yes I am. But as it stands, what do we aspire to become within the EU? Other countries like Switzerland and Norway have a GDP twice as high. Perhaps I'm being optimistic but Britain has a trade surplus in almost every service sector except tourism, we have the ability to do well outside of the EU and smash the glass ceiling that is the EU trading bloc. We have the potential, we are the world’s fifth largest economy and fourth largest military power. One of only five countries with a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. The WTO has driven down trade tariffs and we'll be afforded the opportunity to import far cheaper without European trade quotas cock blocking us and gain far more access to international markets. In regards to immigration, it's not something the fearmongers have frightened me with, but I CAN see it pragmatically. The housing crisis (mostly private but some social) is unable to sustain the type of numbers we are receiving now without an influx from newly registered EU countries. I'm by no means a British nationalist, I just think we can emulate other non EU European countries to increase our standard of living."

1132,"Scientist here. We always publish the crazy things we find because more people read our stuff then. Hiding abnormal results so that other scientists can take some of the credit when they publish the same results? That doesn't fit. If you find something interesting, you publish it, and add a comment emphasising that it was only one experiment so the values could be inaccurate. 

Edit: I published some work on a novel compound that is found in oranges in minute quantities that showed some decent anti oxidant and anticancer effects on breast cancer cells. One of those pop science sites picked it up and I believe their headline was: Potential cure for cancer found in oranges. Moral of the story: don't let idiots report your science. Similar thing happened with the whole MSG fiasco. The folks who worked on that explicitly stated that MSG may show harmful effects, but not enough data was collected to confirm anything, and that further research was required. The headline was: MSG causes cancer and diabetes. When further research was done proving MSG to be virtually harmless, it was mostly ignored. So it's important to look at the difference between science and pop science. If you're interested in a particular field of science, get online, find free journals, and read peer reviewed articles. Also, always be critical of any work you read, because some of it is useless information that was just published for the sake of a masters degree.

1152,"In Grade 6, I started up a cult-like club for my friends called “tytoalbaism,” which was based off of the scientific name for the barn owl, the tyto alba. Ironically, the club/cult had absolutely nothing to do with owls, barn owls, latin species names or anything that the words tyto alba would lead you to believe. Instead, the cult/club focussed on playing the video game Pokemon: Platinum (and later on, Pokemon: HeartGold/SoulSilver), doing well in school (I’m not joking), hating on an altogether different videogame called Battleforge, and learning how to hypnotize people (again, not joking). As the club/cult expanded, I added on some other facets of club life, such as the “bunny club,” (which I still don’t have any idea what the logic behind that was), the “duck song club,” (which, of course, was based on the popular YouTube video of “The Duck Song”) and the “fish club” (where we taught people how to say the word “fish” in a multitude of different languages, including Portuguese, French, Norwegian, Chinese, and German). To top it all off, I ranked people in the class based on a system we called “Tyto’s Ranking System,” where the highest rank possible was “Tyto Alba,” followed closely by “Tyto Multiplicanta,” “Tyto,” “Intermediate,” “Crab” and “Noob.” Somehow, I convinced my entire class to sign up, even though over 50% of them never showed up to my free hypnotism seminars or watched my Pokemon Platinum videos.

Men have just as much a right (if not more, statistically speaking) to be scared in unequivocally scary situations - like a huge, openly threatening guy or dangerous areas at night. But generally speaking, women have more potentially threatening situations than men do. As a 5'3"" woman, I get a little on guard when men of fairly average size aggressively catcall me - not because I really think they'll attack but because I know that if they did, I wouldn't really stand that much of a chance.

When they came to buy beer and i asked for ID i was most often given either these really cheap looking laminated ""international student identification"" cards or like an ID stolen from distant family member or just someone who vaguely looked like them. 

My favorite from that festival was a group of kids came up all confident looking. I asked what they wanted (we also sold bottled water for a buck so you'd ask what they wanted before asking for ID, even though it was a beer tent), they all wanted beer so i asked for their IDs. They all gave me these international student IDs that i had seen dozens of time before. They used a pretty basic template, and you could buy them from numerous places in the city from places like head shops and weird underground t-shirt and blacklight poster stores and they were clearly not legit.

But that's not what i busted them on. When they got their crappy fake IDs made they had all chosen the wrong year to put on their date of birth, so based on their ID they were all still only 18 anyways when our drinking age is 19. 

So i just handed them back to the kids and said ""these say you are only 18. come back in a year when you are old enough"" and they walked away all angrily glaring at one of their friends. One of the other guys in the beer tent speculated the kid receiving the hateful looks was probably the friend who convinced them all to shell out the 40 or 50 bucks for those crappy fake IDs. "

1262,"This is wrong in so many ways. I can't think of a single time where male nudity served the plot. Hodor in season one running up naked, actor guy with warts on his dick, wine merchant that tried to kill Dany. None of it was used to serve the plot. You could argue that the merchant was to show how vulnerable and humiliated he was but it was hardly needed.

Meanwhile with the women it can definitely be for sex appeal with no substance but there are plenty of examples of it being relevant and good for the story. Dany stepping out of the fire house not only because the fire would obviously have burned her clothes but also showed how naked and alone she conquered some of the greatest killers in the world. It was a rebirth much like a Phoenix. Cersei was a huge one that was absolutely needed for the scene when she did the walk of shame. It was her at her most vulnerable having to walk in front of the people she had been repressing for so long. I won't detail every one but you get the idea.

Response:  

&gt; I apologize on her behalf that she's a total cunt.  

You don't have to go far to find it, and this is relatively mild compared to a lot of stuff I see on here. The attitudes about women a lot of guys on here have is toxic and gross."
1275,"No.  No it's not. 

 It's scary and demeaning. 

It you want to give me a compliment,  walk up to me,  look me in they eyes  and say ""hey,  you've  got nice eyes""   or ""hey,  I love how well-read you are."" 

 Don't  lean out of a car window  as you drive by slowly and yell *""I'd  fuck you!""*  or *""hey sexy!""*  or *""come sit on my face!""*  or *""why don't  you take those yoga pants off for me!""* 

Those are not compliments,  they are sexual harassment. 


When we women get catcalled,  this first place our minds go is not ""oh wow,  he must really like me""  it is,  *""oh god,  I hope that car keeps going""*  or  *""I hope they don't get out of that car and try to rape me""*


We unfortunately live in a culture that is very forgiving of rape and sexual assault,  often with few or minor consequences for those who commit such acts,  so we as women are taught to constantly be on guard and wary of situations where such things could happen. 



Think of it this way,  if you were alone in your car,  and you saw a woman walking down the street,  would you say those things?   Probably not.   Most men yell those things at women when they are in groups.   If you were alone,  you would probably walk up to her and try to start a conversation,  rather than just shouting at her from a moving car.   

Also,  catcalling is always unwarranted.  It is strangers leering at women from the safty and anonymity of their cars, making un-asked for comments about a woman's  body or appearance. 

Also,  I've  never had someone catcall me with *""I like your hat!""*

Another irony was that during the proliferation of the idea of evolution, many scientists rejected monogeny (the idea that we all came from one group) and embraced polygeny (the idea that humans independently evolved).

1310,"When I was in 7th grade, for science class we had to write a paper for a physics project. I was nearly failing science but doing great in english, so I saw this as my chance to catch up.

Our paper was to write a short story using examples of physics terms accurately: ""inertia"", ""momentum"", and ""mass"" were some of the included terms.

I wrote a humorous short story in ""the three stooges"" style, basically slapstick comedy in writing. There was no blood, death, or anything gory, just silly head bonks and such. I remember the line,

&gt;Steve swung the stick down at the bee on John's head. As the bee floated away, the stick struck John on the skull, the *momentum* transferring to his cranium. John's *inertia* kept him still for a moment before falling, due to his *mass*.

Something like that.


Anyways, the teacher fails me on the paper and calls my parents in for a conference. She disgustedly throws the paper across the table to my father and says, ""I found this very disturbing.""

Long story short she tried to play it up like I was a school shooter in the making and have me expelled to a disciplinary school where you complete all your work in **solitary confinement**. That didn't happen fortunately, but I never forgot her vendetta against me."

When all at once, all three cats jumped to attention simultaneously. Their eyes were fixed to a specific point in space in the middle of the room. Since all 3 were in different spots in the room you could triangulate where they were looking and track its movement. The cats heads moved in unison. I got up and tried to see what they were looking at, but all I saw was empty space. The cats slowly tracked whatever it was to a wall adjacent to the kitchen. All 3 cat then ran into the kitchen. I followed. Whatever it is was must have disappeared. When I got around to the kitchen, all 3 cats were looking in different directions, all still very alert. They kept scanning the living room and kitchen quite some time afterward. My girlfriend and I never saw anything. I still don't know what it was and I'm a sceptic by nature. Thinking about it still gives me chills.

The Speaker trilogy is VERY DIFFERENT. But it really is the foundation for exploring so many deep sci-fi concepts like AI and the realities of human colonization. Including a deep exploration of how messed up space travel is when you don't have an FTL drive but rather have to travel at relativistic speeds. 

The way I always describe the difference between the two is like this: Ender's Game is like Star Wars, The Speaker trilogy is like Star Trek. 

Ender's Game is an action packed survival/adventure story in a sci-fi setting with a strongly relatable protagonist.

The Speaker for the Dead is a lot more philosophical, exploring many different interesting sci-fi concepts like the idea of first contact, the role of religion in colonization, the logistics of space travel, etc. 

There's a lot to love in both. Personally Speaker for the Dead (and the subsequent sequels) is one of my favorite books of all time and genuinely impacted my life and the way I view things pretty significantly."

1348,"I'll start this out by saying I live in the South. You know which South I'm talking about. The Southern United States of Murica. Now, I don't go to parties very often, but I'm in college now and I got invited to a birthday bonfire for a buddy of mine. After much debate, I decided to go just to see what it was like. 

It started off horribly. Sketchy as fuck. But I was curious and it seemed like it would make a good story someday. Today is that day. So I drive to the address the friend gave me and find out that it's not at the friend's house, it's at some random person's house. I'm a little early, there is only one other guest there, and it's not dark out yet so we wait for more people to show up. At this point, it's me, the owner of the land, and some mousey girl. I don't know either of these people and it's freezing cold so I sit in my car. Eventually a truck full of people shows up and it's got my friend (J), his brother (B) and an old highschool friend of mine (D) all in the back end. They hop out and direct me to follow them down the terrifying and poorly maintained driveway to the bonfire site. Okay. Cool. I feel a little better at this point. We drive down the driveway very very slowly because there are potholes everywhere. They get the fire going and start drinking and I think nothing of it because I'm just chilling listening to everyone's gossip and I figure I can leave at any time. 

A few hours later, I hear a bunch of commotion around the vehicles. Apparently D, who is drunker than a whiskey tasting spit bowl, had decided he wanted to go buy some cigarettes in the truck they came in with. Someone is bitching about parole, someone else is shouting to just drag him out of the driver's seat, everyone is gathered around the vehicles shouting at him. I stay back and kinda slink towards my car without drawing any attention to myself. I haven't had anything to drink, so I'm okay to drive. I crank my truck and realize someone is parked behind me. Fuck. So I decided to just stay locked in my car and watch. The owner of the property gets absolutely sick of D's shit and goes to his car, pulls out a shotgun and gets right in the passenger seat. He's holding the gun to D's head, shouting at him to get the fuck out of the driver's seat or he will shoot him. Eventually D has to puke so he jumps out of the truck and vomits for a while. The owner is still holding the shotgun to him and screaming. Mousey girl sees me and realizes she's parked behind me and runs to her car. She moves and I hightail it right the fuck out of there. 

Two months later, I see D at a different (much smaller/non alcoholic) social gathering and tell him this story. He has NO IDEA that any of that happened but everyone around me corroborates and we all have a good laugh. Turns out he didn't get shot though, so that's good. 

TL;DR Drunk guy wants to drive, shotgun man to the rescue. "

Like, if she's hanging with a few friends, I'm curious as to which friends, and I give her that same courtesy, and I'll let her know which friends I'm hanging out with.

Is that a bad jealousy? Like I said, I'm trying to get better and not be such a terrible individual, but I don't want her to think I'm an abusive partner because I'm trying to become more open and trusting. She says it's okay but I don't want her to wake up one day and hate me because of it."

1379,"Muslim here, yes. The Qur'an mentions Jinn specifically as one of the three ""sentient"" creations of Allah (that we know of) - humans, Jinn, and Angels. Humans were formed from clay/dirt, Jinn were formed from a ""smokeless fire"", and Angels were formed from Noor (light). Humans and Jinn have free will and will be judged by Allah, while Angels do not have free will and obey Allah absolutely.

In Islamic theology, Satan is not a fallen Angel (Angels cannot ""fall"" because they have no free will), but a Jinn who rebelled because he thought himself as superior to humans.

Belief in Jinn and Angels falls under ""Imaan bil-Ghaib"" (Faith in the Unseen), similar to Heaven and Hell.

That being said, I think Jinn have been made as a sort of bogeyman scapegoat in a lot of Muslim societies with all manners of misfortune (especially genuine mental illness) somehow being blamed on them."

Is he only agreeing to go out to humor me? Does he actually want to keep seeing me?"" Being straightforward about this stuff and expressing how you feel, even in little ways (like ""can't wait to see you!"" or ""so glad we were able to meet up""), goes so far."

1398,"Yeah; I'm a CSGO player and in the few times I've seen a girl get on the mic in a competitive match (in CSGO nearly everyone uses their mic, in case you don't know this) they'd always get an avalanche of shit thrown their way. Most of the time it caused them to stop talking after a while, making them a much less useful teammate because communication is key in a game like that. 

They were entirely justified to stop talking by the way, it's just a shame that gaming (or at least the games I follow/play) still have such a ridiculous attitude towards female gamers. I mean I play with a woman sometimes (who constantly gets friend requests and stupid indecent proposals and so on) and obviously banter should be allowed (I'm not being a white knight here) but I seriously thought 'lol is ur computer in ur kitchen hahaha' had stayed in the year 2006.

My husband didn't remind him about it during *his mother's funeral* that the minister was doing for his family. I just about lost my shit in the office stairwell and I'm going to guess by all the stares I had coming back in that the stairwell where we are suppose to take calls was not soundproof.

We tried anyways because I was like, ""If she asks for ID, we'll just walk back and get it."" (it was only maybe 6 blocks, not bad just dangerous when you're a ginger.) The cashier asked for his ID and he explained that he forgot it at the house and we had just walked there, but she said ""Sorry, but I'll need to see an ID. I haven't even ever seen you in here before."" which was totally reasonable. I was ready to turn around and walk back before she had even said that, but oh no, he tells her ""Why don't you just listen to me when I say my birthday is 03/17/95 and give me that pack of Pyramid Menthols, so I don't have to walk all the way back with my girl for nothing in this heat"" (not very kindly, either) and she tells him again no, she can't do that and it's policy, and he starts yelling at her. Eventually when he realizes she won't do it he says ""FINE. But you remember this green fucking hair, you remember this face and next time don't you dare ask me for my fucking ID""

God, he was such a dick. I don't know how I stuck around for almost a year. I hope he's grown up since then. So entitled...

They're older than me so I'm trying to be respectful and ignore them while I'm serving other college students (who were probably also drunk) and finally the loudest one in the group of four spills his drink all over the floor, at least a 5'x5' area.  I say excuse me to the person who's order I'm taking, walk to the back and come back up front with a mop.  Without saying a word I look this kid in the eyes and hold the mop straight out to him in the air.

When I was about sixteen, I worked at a haunted house. I had been working there for about 2 years, which was abnormal as they don't usually allow people under the age of 16 to work there, however, the owner happened to be my bishop at the time, knew my family was struggling, and offered me a job. I never drove down to the haunted house on my own, as I just rode with the owner to save gas, even when I legally could drive. We usually got off work at about 2-4 am, depending on the night. Well one night after work, my bishop says he needs to stop by the church in our neighborhood on our way home, so me, my bishop, and his son (he was about 18) stop by the church, and on our way in we all walk into the gym (we were trying to cut through to get to his office on the other side of the church) and upon walking in and turning on the lights we notice this one corner of the room wasn't being lit up, as if the light couldn't filter through it. It wasn't like completely pitch black staring into the nether type dark, but noticeably darker, as if it was harder for the light to shine in that one particular spot. Well as soon as we walk in and all see it, the ""darkness"" or whatever the fuck you would call it, starts slowly fucking MOVING TOWARDS US. Me and the bishops son both just stood there, not sure what was happening, until his father said in a very calm but concerned voice ""get out, wait for me in the car"" we both ran out of that church so fast, then ended up waiting about a half an hour for my bishop to come outside, and when we asked him what happened, he refused to Tell us, and to this day he hasn't told either me or his son what happened in there. But I will to this day still refuse to step foot in another church."

Broken tables, glass, awnings ripped down, safe emptied, the works. It was my last day and I was used to his antics and was intent on cleaning the place and opening by myself, as I was used to doing by this point. I get a call from the owner, who is convinced that he left 1500 in cash laying around somewhere and he wanted me to find it. Of course there is no money, he took it and blew it all the night before. Keep in mind, at this point I am very used to his antics and just about nothing phases me. He had always treated me like a daughter and has never given me a reason to think he would hurt me, despite being a cokehead with a record of multiple assault charges. After I hung up I felt sick with fear that he was going to show up to look for the nonexistent money. I was shaking and felt panicked about even being the restaurant. The cook tried to convince me that he wouldn't show up and not to worry, but I couldn't shake my gut feeling that something bad was about to happen. I called my boyfriend who had dropped me off and told him to turn around and get me. Shortly after I left, owner showed up in a frenzy and got into a fight with the cook.

Due to intelligent engineering, the top roll pushes down on the bottom one (the one you can reach) so that the bottom roll  won't 'roll'.

You can't reach the top roll or budge it in any way.

The bottom roll is stuck by the weight of the top one and it won't move. It takes 15 min of clawing just to move the roll enough to find the beginning.

Or you never do and have to create a 'beginning' by clawing at it.

Then you have to claw at it for another 15 minutes to get it to move a fraction of a centimeter, at that point you have a pile of unusable shreds of toilet paper on the floor and you still haven't amassed enough to wipe your ass."

The high pressure nozzles break the hard dirt into mud and the vacuum sucks it up. 

Anyway, a guy on DIY was digging in extremely hard ground and I suggested putting a little water on it to soften the ground. It's a trick I have used in the past. I also suggested that if he has a pressure washer he could use it to break the dirt down into what is essentially slurry and scoop it out. 

The guy who disagreed said that digging in the mud was much more difficult and that I didn't know what I was talking about and I probably never have done real work blah blah blah. 

I probably shouldn't have let it bother me but I really felt like if he tried to go and do what I do in the conditions I work in he might not be able to make it through the day without falling out. Lol. "

1633,"A couple of points:

1. It's not age, but engagement. I know plenty of 16 year olds who have a far better understanding of politics than people 3 or 4 times their age. Young people can often be more engaged in politics than older people because they're young and passionate. Do you really think the Brexit vote was decided by highly informed voters? Most voters in most elections are low information voters, who vote based off emotion, gut feeling, or misinformed opinions (that goes for all sides of politics).

2. In a vote of this nature, that has massive long-term consequences that will span multiple decades, not simply one or two election cycles, why should young people be locked out when older people get the vote. In terms of consequences, the Brexit vote has far more impact on the young than the old, who are now going to be locked out of labour markets, economic markets, immigration, etc. To the old, this vote won't matter much. They will be dead and buried and Britain will remain locked out of the word's biggest economic community."

1642,"Both mine have to do with my car; I swear I'm not a bad driver, just unlucky! 

Driving with boyfriend to his dad's house so he can visit his pet snake. He gets confused on directions and we get a little lost. Pull into someone's driveway in order to turn around, and miss the driveway slightly to the right so I'm pulled into the grass a bit. No big deal, grass will grow back if it's damaged, right? Go to back out of the driveway/grass and I guess there was something sticking out of the grass, a metal spike is my best guess (I didn't see it when we pulled in), whatever it was made this HORRIBLE ripping noise. We sped out of there super fast and didn't look back till we got to his dad's place. Turns out it nearly ripped my bumper off and ripped out one of the fog lights from the bottom... his dad zip ties the bumper back on and to this day my mom hasn't found out what happened, even though she's had my car taken to several repair shops for tires/unrelated things over the years.

Second thing happened at college. At the time I was working weekday afternoons for a popular after-school program in my area, basically we go around to different schools each day and run the program for them in the cafeteria. Well, I went to class that morning and ended up falling asleep in the library after class on one of the really comfy couches they have in there. Wake up and realize it's about an hour until I have to be at the school for the day, still haven't bought after school snacks or activity supplies, freak out and run to my car in order to get to the store and to the school on time. Start pulling out without looking and slam into someone's rear bumper, the guy had been looking for a spot and stopped at the end of the aisle for a minute. I get out, he gets out, I'm sweating bullets, he tells me this is his gf's car and she's gonna be pissed, calls her, and she shows up in 5 minutes... and tells me not to worry about it. Sends me on my way. I made it to work on time and everything. I thank the powers that be every single time I think about it."

Saw her pic, she looked kinda chubby. Sweet talked her a bit, and she invited me to her house way out in the country side.

My dad (of all people!) drove me to a run down trailer home in the woods, and left me. There's horses and goats and shit, humble people. I knock on the door and ask for whatsername. My heart's pounding. Wtf, why am I even here besides I'm a sex addict?

A lady answers, and she lays on country hospitality really thick! I think it was the girl's mom? I sit on the couch waiting awkwardly.

And this enthusiastic, short, busty fat girl with wearing a lot of makeup comes out with her purse all dolled up. We leave in a mini van together - and talk about Jesus on the way as I assure her I'm a good guy.

She seems a bit simple minded like she huffed glade in the past. She drives me back to my house, we go to my room, and within 10 minutes of watching a movie, well, you get the point. No strings attached, right? Wrong.

Months later her psycho drug addict boyfriend gets out of jail, finds out where I live 30 miles away, and he's pissed. The girl tells me I should watch my back.

Creeps me out to this day. Saw her Facebook and she lives in a nasty hotel in Tampa nowadays with an old old dude who probably pimps her out."

I learned that I had got those drinks for free!  

At hers, I asked her why she'd gone and paid

1720,"One time I was strolling through the park and came across a weird sort of booth in the middle of nowhere. Behind it was an overweight guy feasting on what appeared to be bags of chips. I walked up to him despite thinking that it was some sort of trap to rob me or something. I asked him what he was doing in the middle of nowhere. 

""Selling raffle tickets. One dollar. Want one?"" he inquired.

""What's the prize?"" I responded. 

He held up a chip, the last of his pack, and threw it into his mouth. About three packs remained. I had a dollar in my pocket, so I figured that I didn't have much to do. I threw the dollar in the money jar and wrote my name on the paper. I stuck the paper in the (surprisingly full) name jar and took a step back. The dude pulled out a name. It was mine. He gave me a bag and looked at me like he was expecting more money or something. 

""If you put in another dollar, you have a chance to win,"" he said, ""another one."" 

I realized that the strange man selling me tickets was in fact DJ Khaled himself. I was shocked, so I handed him another dollar. I wrote my name and put it in the jar. He shuffled his hand and pulled out his own name.

""Congratulations, you played yourself,"" he murmured. He took the remaining chip bags and disappeared into the woods. "

The thing is, I grew up in a home with :

- an Alcoholic/abusive father

- A chronically stressed mother

- Three older sisters (who seem to have been fucking up since I was a little kid)

After spending 3 days there over christmans, I had this feeling that I don't want to be around these people.

I've also moved to a new town about a year ago where my wife's family lives, and everything my family lacked, her family makes up for in spades.

Like the moment I saw what a functional family actually looks/feels like, I cannot get myself to like anything my own family does.

I know they love me, but I'm probably never going to spend more than a couple of days there since I cannot stand being around them or dealing with their issues.

It also doesn't help that my dad is desperately trying to repair our relationship, but since he was an abusive/drunk asshole for the first 18 years of my life, and then I moved out when I was 19(I'm 28 now), we never really fixed it(and even though I've tried to, I don't think its ever going to be fixed).

The cinematic film ending has Will Smith martyring himself to take out the horde of vampires attacking him. The alternate film ending has him living and rebuilding humanity, where he becomes legend amongst the revitalized human populace for reversing the apocalypse.

On a trip to Vegas in the late 90's or early 2000's, we went to this antique strip mall that had antique Nippon as well as an antique toy store. My dad and I headed to the toy store, called Toyz in the Attic, while my mom headed to an antique store in the corner of the lot. Not long after my dad bought me a G1 Devastator, my mom called and told us to come over. She stated to my dad that the owner had some more Nippon antiques in the back of his store, but my mom was weary of going back there alone. So we leave the antique toy store and head over to meet my mom.

We get in the store and I remember it being a nice, chill temperature. The windows were tinted. It wasn't lit up very brightly, but there were enough items to fill the walls of the store. This isn't my nature, but I didn't even walk around because the owner, Tony, seemed pretty interesting. Also, he didn't seem the type of owner to carry Transformers, the robots or the ones for train sets. He talked to us about the future of Vegas and how it was changing for the worse. After talking for a little bit, he asked me if i would like to try on a samurai helmet. At first I didn't want to try on a dusty helmet, but the look on my mom's face translated to ""this is probably going to be your one and only chance to wear this, don't be a fool."" My mom takes a picture of me and asks Tony if she could take a picture of him. He says no, but my mom takes a picture anyway. He apparently was a little ticked off, but they continued talking. Tony also mentioned how he survived a fire, I'm unsure of the time frame atm. Additionally, my mom saw people peeking in the store, but no one ever came in. We never got to see the back room. My parents purchase a gold Buddha from Tony which he gave to them for a pretty good price (I believe $125?) so we all left happy.

A year later we returned to the same antique strip mall in Vegas. We go to the corner where Tony's store was at and it was a bookstore. My parents talk to the owner(s) while I walk around. Apparently the antique book store had been there for 5-7 years. My parents told them we were just here a year ago and Tony's shop was at that location. They didn't believe my parents and told them that Tony had passed away in a fire from smoke inhalation, in the back room. His more valuable antiques were back there too. They also mentioned that he never gave out deals to anyone. As I'm walking around and overhearing some of this conversation I find a display case full of one of my favorite books, Mysteries of the Unexplained by Readers Digest. Additionally, the photo of me wearing the samurai helmet developed while the photo of Tony was white.

Seriously, just 3 days a week, 1 hour each session, is enough to make a significant improvement to your physique.

Granted, I'm not huge by any means, but I was extremely skinny and have already gained 10 pounds of muscle in just two months. That's quite a bit for a scrawny fellow like myself.

Working out also helps other things mentioned in this thread like posture, confidence, and happiness. So it really helps you hit all the bases.

He's 25, middle child. I know and the next oldest knows (of 5). He wont admit it or talk about it, I've tried a few times to get him to open up, but he just denied it day in and day out. 

""But...what does this have to do with the question asked by op?""

Well, I only found out because I googled my name. My name isn't super common so I'm always the second result on google. Anyways, I ended up googling myself for one reason or another and there, on page 4 is a website I'd never heard of with my name and a picture...of middle brother. Intrigued, I go to the site and find out that it's basically a dating site/facebook just for LGBT and extreme kinks. My brother had a profile using my name but his pictures. 

He listed himself as gay and after reading his profile for two seconds, I realized without a doubt, this was no joke. 


That was about 10 years ago. I know he's had a girlfriend or two since then, but both were short and not very serious at all. It was really weird to find on the internet. It's just extremely awkward to find out something like that just by googling my own name. Funny enough, I'm pretty sure he used my name so no one googles his, unfortunately for him...my name is uncommon while his is incredibly common. He'd have been better off. "

Then idk if he didn't hear what she said or what but he was like ""you have the prettiest eyes i have ever seen"" and she was like thanks haha but with a faked but obviously uncomfortable smile if oyure not like face blind or whatever its called, and he was like ""no don't laugh, i mean it"" and she said thanks again and was like well you have a nice night and he was like ""let me look at your eyes for a minute"" and she was like what and he was like ""your eyes are so pretty, let me look at them for a minute"" and she was like omg by her face looked real scared but he just stared at her eyes makin all these comments bout how he aint ever seen anything so beautiful 

she'd be like i need to get some stuff done now and hed be like 'just let me look at them for a bit longer"" each time. she mentioned needin to help me out since i was behind him, and he said it was no problem she could go ahead and get me, he could still look at how beautiful she was. i'm super timid and wimpy but i didnt wanna leave her alone with him so i was like oh crap i forgot something and went to a aisle and spent forever just grabbing random things and being like 'eh...nah' and putting them back and repeating. eventually another guy came in and paid for his gas and then stood there listening to the creepy guy for a min then was like, ""alright buddy you need to cut it out and go"" and walked him out and waited and the creepy guy left, even stayed a good while after he pumped his gas, thank god for that guy lol, would've had to spend the night there or somethin at that rate otherwise. girl quit there though didn't see her there again after that, was like dang, sad that her boyfriend was right to worry, shocked me so much though i never seen anything like that before that that i can remember atleast"

It feels absolutely powerless and debilitating and downright frightening. So this time some other guy showed up after you and stopped it, but she had to endure that asshole so much longer and had you spoke up and said anything, literally, anything, it would be better.

1916,"EDIT : Wow, I figured I was going to be late enough that not a lot of people would see this! 

Anyways.. So I forgot a really important part of this story, so as I mentioned before I am also a soldier, and two friends of mine here that are married and both in the Army that work with me are here also. So my friends wife goes out of town for some reason or another, and myself and my buddy invite said girl (while she was living with me, post-abortion) out to dinner to try and get her out of the house, because she was super upset about the whole thing, and we were trying to cheer her up. Well, we go out and get food, and have a few drinks and come back to my house. The whole night, my friend had been acting really flirty towards the girl and it was was weird seeing him act that way, because he was married, to my friend none the less.. So about 10pm ish and quite a few more drinks later I call it a night, I had some stuff to do early Saturday morning, and I wanted to get some rest. So the next afternoon, Kelly (the girl) explains that my buddy had stayed over there until like 6am and they finished off another bottle of liquor and she woke up on the couch with his kissing her neck, and trying to finger her. 

Now, I've know my friends a LOT longer than I had known Kelly, and I didn't want to believe it, but I wasn't oblivious to the fact that he had been flirting with her, his wife was out of town, and they had both had a lot to drink. I told her, that it didn't really seem like him to do something like that, and she showed me a bunch of texts between the two of them about what had happened, which confirmed it did happen, at least ""something"" happened. It was never specifically noted WHAT happened. So, my buddy shows up Sunday with some form of what I can only assume was a peace offering/please dont tell my wife. He replaced all the booze we drank saturday night, and gave Kelly a $200 bottle of wine, and gave me a $300 bottle of whisky. 

So, his wife gets back, and Kelly went out of her way to find her on facebook, and messaged her and told her that her husband had cheated on her... at this point, Kelly has moved out, and is living with her mom again. Her mom accidentally backed over my mailbox leaving with her stuff one day and I had remained in touch with her for a little while because she was going to cut me a check to replace it. So, we had spoken a few more times about Kelly's behavior and her mom told me that Kelly had basically made the whole thing up between the two of them. She never kicked her out, she never trashed her shit. Kelly wanted some money for something or another and her mother wouldn't give it to her, and so she left to go live with her aunt. Which is what started the whole thing. 

In regards to the folder, apparently the soldiers that had ""raped her"" had been following her, and were selling/making drugs in their house ON THE FUCKING BASE.... -_-  and she had proof of all of this via printed text messages, and facebook messenger pages etc, that she had printed off.. but had deleted the texts and messages. She claimed that she needed it so she could press charges and what not. I did indeed look all over my house for this folder, because IF it did exist, I wanted to see this magical folder.. PLOT TWIST. I never fucking found it. what a shocker right? So she tells the cops, her mom, and her dad in Aus, that I have the proof and im intentionally keeping it from her. So her mom, calls me and begs me to give it to her, I explain for the MILLIONTH time that I don't have it, i don't believe it exists, and that I don't give two shits about it anymore. So then the cops show up, at my house and explain that i'm hindering an ongoing investigation and they have a search warrant for my house to look for this folder. I laughed and let them in. They searched everywhere and were confident that I didn't have it. A few days later they show up, with ANOTHER search warrant, only this time... its for my fucking hard drive.. Because she claimed that all the messages were sent and received from my desktop, which she had used before. I explained to them that it was password protected, and that I never game her the password, and the only times she used the computer was when I was home to check her emails a few times. 

They brought her to my house and I told the cops they could have the computer if she could unlock it. She couldn't . They took the computer anyways. For almost 1 year. They never did find anything on it of any value. 

Anyways, moving along.. her father decides to send me a message on facebook again about this folder, and I agree to have a skype call with him. By this point I just want these people to just leave me the fuck alone, and if I have to spend 20 minutes on the phone with this dude to get that, I was willing to do so. So he calls one evening, and we talked about everything that had happened and he keeps going on and on about this stupid fucking folder. I lost my shit and basically told him his daughter was a fucking lying piece of shit, that lied about anything and everything she could to get sympathy from others. 

OH THAT REMINDS ME AGAIN! She lied to me and told me that her boyfriend in Aus of like 8 years committed suicide by hanging himself in their house and she came home and found it, and she was all messed up over it bla bla bla.. I'm trying to remember WHY she told me that story because it was semi-relevant to the entire story but I did say something about it to her mom at the hospital and her mom goes ""this guy?"" and pulls up his facebook.. motherfucker is alive and well and definitely not dead. I contacted him about 6 months after all of this and he basically confirmed everything i thought. She lied to him and all her friends about anything and everything. She lied about WHY she left aus, it was due to all the lies she had told and I guess she had gotten in some shit with some people and she was legit afraid for her life and so she left. 

As far as the soldier that raped her, I went out of my way to find him and apologize to him, because I felt SO terrible that I let someone deceive me into almost getting this dude kicked out of the army. Didn't really matter though, his reputation was already ruined, and last I heard he did finally PCS away from this duty station and is doing better at his new unit, because no one knows about it. But he was very very close to getting kicked out of the army, and ending up in prison over all of this. Last I heard about Kelly, she left the US and went back to Aus, becasue her mom DID kick her out this time, and that the US was trying to get her back here to arrest her for the entire ordeal, because she lied to federal agents, and made up all this shit, and they're trying to prosecute her for it. 

Sorry it took me so long to get back to you guys! I didn't mean to keep you waiting!!

If you have any questions, or want any further clarifications ill be happy to give them.

PS - My friend and his wife - She did talk to Kelly about everything that happened and his wife asked me what I thought about it, and I told her that honestly, I felt something MAY have happened between them, but I have no idea what. She lied about literally anything and everything and I wouldn't be surprised if she had exaggerated everything about that as well.

I had two moral dilemmas right then. Grab the box of breadsticks I just threw away and give it to her without her seeing or make a new batch. Ended up making a new batch, which you could only make in a tray of twelve, gave her her three. Then there sat 9 more brand new fresh breadsticks. I almost cried throwing them away. "

2011,"Paying for shit.

This could be a cultural thing, i don't know if it applies globally. Most guys think that they should be the one paying. I've been scolded and given the cold shoulder multiple times by men because i insisted on paying for my own or our shared meal/drinks etc on dates. 

I used to be very strict about paying for my own stuff. I would not let anyone pay for me unless we're in an actual, established relationship, but after a while, i realised that some guys were really, i mean really offended by that. Then i started letting them pay if they insist. 

Still, even when you're in a relationship, money sort of becomes an issue even with the most progressive guy. I don't date macho types anyway, but to some extent, all my partners have had issues with money. 

I've always had more than they did. Based on the guy, it can turn into either him seeing you as his mother, or him feeling emasculated and inferior. And they usually, slightly become douchey when that happens. I've observed my ex as he became more and more into things that are traditionally considered masculine even though he had zero interest in them in the beginning of our relationship.

I have more money, i have no problem with spending my money on us. We've been together for years, of course i'm gonna invite you with me when i go on an expensive vacation. You have no way of paying for that, so of course i'm gonna pay for it and not expect you to cover your own share. That was my way of thinking and seems like it works for a while, but problems always surface. 

With some of them, it turns into them being less and less dominant and sort of becoming your kid and i hate that. I don't mean they ask for money or expect you to pay, that never happened, i haven't really dated any assholes, but they kinda just stop deciding anything and assign you the governor of the relationship. Which is sort of a whoever pays is the boss mentality and it is not cool.

And some just start getting restless, and try to provide stuff for you that's undoubtedly gonna cause problems in their finances. And of course, that never ends well because now you're a strain on their budget even though you never asked for anything.

Or, you just stop spending money and live within their means to prevent them from feeling uncomfortable, and you start feeling resentment because you're missing out on stuff you could easily be doing.

Anyways, just be okay with women paying for shit. If i make 50 times what you make, you really shouldn't have a problem with me paying. It's just money."
2012,"We're friends now.  

Our relationship started out very nice but towards the end it was miserable.  Then after about half a year she texted me and we became friends, and it's been one of the best friendships of my life - we do lots of fun things together, like when we were dating but without the pressure and expectations (and without me paying double for everything).  And we have great conversations, much better than when we were dating.  She still has an awesome body and gorgeous eyes and she's a bit flirtatious, but insists she's not attracted to me - while also talking about how fickle female attraction is.  

Oh well - I can obviously still date other girls, which I do from time to time. Although at some point it will be weird if I'm in a serious relationship with someone else and there's this close female friend I'm still attracted to.  But I try not to screw myself in the present by worrying about the future, for now this works quite well.  "

2018,"Worked as a bartender for a short time near this small bar that had a second floor which people can rent for four to six hours.

I was stationed up there for the night and watched these wannabe thugs messing with this guy I knew personally. Now this guy had some problems last year: he was jailed for about a month because he was involved in this drug raid, plus some other things before I met him. 

He was a really nice guy once you met him but if you get on his bad side, you're gonna get what's coming to you.

Anyway, the guy was still calm, but got pissed when the wannabe thug mentioned his jail time. He wasn't proud of that, because at the time, he was trying his best to be a good citizen..

He grabbed a bottle of brandy from the bar and right in front of me, he hit the wannabe thug with the bottle, which broke on contact. 

The music stopped as soon as the guy dropped to the floor, dizzy and wet with mixture of his own blood and the contents of the bottle. The wannabe thugs' friends moved back instantly, stuttering like dumbasses, saying they don't want a fight.

The bouncers escorted the wannbe thug and his friends, but didn't lay a hand on my friend. He left the party without saying anything else. 

I quit that job after three days, because immediately two days after, some drunk partygoer started a bar fight, and almost everyone in the bar started throwing fists and chairs everywhere.

A: [292](/spoiler)


Explaination: [Although 300 is the highest score, a 2 count is the most difficult number of pins to pick off from a full rack (significantly harder than throwing a strike). Rolling a 292 involves the exact same setup as a 300 but requires you to throw a 2 count as the last ball rather than a strike. The score is so rare that many bowlers bored with 300s shoot for 292s instead.](/spoiler)"

But then they stopped having me come and i overheard the psych scheduling secretary saying that ""since he doesn't seem like a school shooter it's really not our problem anymore.""

At that moment I realized they didn't care about me, my feelings, or the fact that I was getting the tar kicked out of me in group games of smear the queer on the daily. They only cared about everyone else.

I didn't matter. I was collateral.

My dad wanting to live/ stay married promptly told his boss there was a family emergency and he caught the next flight home.  When he walked in the door my mother greeted him super cheerfully and asked him what he was doing home.

Now to explain your confusion, in the United States you're automatically granted a right to argue your case. You file a lawsuit against some party, visit a judge and then you make your case. If it seems like your lawsuit is justifiable (this is known as ""standing"") it moves on to the pre-trial stage (discovery) where evidence is gathered. From the gathered evidence, you must now prove how the evidence supports your justification for the lawsuit. If it passes this stage, you can move on to trial. If it doesn't pass this stage, your case is thrown out.



The reason we see so many lawsuits in America is because we see a lot of the pre-trial stuff (that is, getting into the discovery phase). The media also *loves* to report on stupid frivolous lawsuits like the above which exacerbates the feeling that this country is very lawsuit-happy.  One could argue it is but another part of it is confirmation bias (we hear people say this country is lawsuit happy with dumb lawsuits, the media reports on a dumb lawsuit, therefore we deduce that this country is very lawsuit happy)."

Best one... This lady came in pissed off from the start. Says her dad upgraded his phone in another state the day before and used her upgrade. She tells me that ""he told them not to fuck it up. They always fuck it up and he told them not to."" And now she wasn't getting calls because ""you people fucked it up!!!"" *points wildly at me* 
So I pull up her account and she's not an authorized user. It's actually her parents account and she's not on it. Account security and stuff, I can't access it (I don't feel like losing my job on this particular day). I tell her she's not on the account and am about to ask to see her phone, maybe it's something going on with the device that I can troubleshoot. She cuts me off though and storms out. Stands outside the store and we watch through the windows while she calls customer care. She is actually stomping her feet and waving and crying and screaming. Eventually she hangs up and calls them back again. Turns out the second time she claimed to be her mother and added herself on as an authorized user. So she comes back in and I get into the account and there's NOTHING WRONG. Ask quickly to see her phone before she starts shouting again... she had ""do not disturb"" turned on. 
She got this priceless look on her face after I'd very calmly explained the problem. Kind of hung her head in shame and says ""you can make fun of me now."" To which I replied ""noooo, of course not.""


Another time I had a family come in who lost an iPhone camping, they started out right off the bat with ""we already tried locating it, it's gone, thank goodness we have insurance, please help us file a claim."" 
Straight forward enough. I do the claim for them (they could have done this online on their own). I'm very polite despite how pushy/demanding they are. Let them know they can come back I when they get it if they need help with iCloud or anything else. 
Next day they come back with the new phone... Walk right up to me while I'm helping someone else and start yelling about how I didn't tell them they could track the old phone. They have a friend who works at Apple and he knows everything and said that I didn't do my job because I didn't try to locate the phone first, etc.
I reminded them that the first thing they mentioned was that they had already tried to locate it. And the husband goes ""well I meant FIND it."" Ok well in Phoneland locating an iPhone means using find my iPhone. Simple communication error, we can still try while its active. But no, he won't listen to anything I'm saying at this point, is acting like a total prick, and becomes kind of scary. 
He ended up calling our district manager later in the week. The DM finally lost his temper and gave the guy a long winded lecture about behaving like an adult, treating retail employees like human beings, etc.

Uncle heard Charlie scream suddenly, like a very uncontrolled scream that you normally don't hear coming out of a 40-something man. Uncle rushed out of the house to figure out what's happening, and Charlie was on the ground, crying, and seemed to literally have lost his mind, behaving like a child. 

Charlie kept yelling something like ""I'm a Muslim, I'm not a pagan, I'm a Muslim"". He later mentioned (several days later) that someone or something was whispering in his head to change his religion, telling him God isn't real and whatnot.

Anyway while Charlie's suffering through this mental breakdown, my uncle spotted a plastic bag next to him. While digging, it seems Charlie found that bag in the dirt and pulled it out, wondering what's inside it. As soon as he touched the bag, the curse in the bag's contents overtook him.

The bag actually contained fresh pig's meat, they later discovered. Somebody had actually buried that bag within just a few days before the time Charlie dug and found it. According to Pakistani paranormal beliefs, red meats are one of the most common mediums to transfer curses to someone. This particular curse was actually meant for my uncle; somebody intended to hurt him, but fortunately or unfortunately, Charlie unknowingly intercepted this attack first.

Charlie was taken to a nearby pir - Pirs are basically Islamic saints who, along with dedicating the majority fo their time to worship, also practice Islamic exorcism.  The Pir explained what was going on in his mystical terms - the pig's meat, the curse, but he didn’t explain the who or the why. Some say Pirs know the answer to those questions and they purposely avoid answering them to avoid causing conflicts.

Charlie was cured in a few day's time by that Pir, and basically returned to normal. That's why it's so interesting when I hear things like these happening - these people are pretty normal, yet some shit happens to them and they either lose their minds or tell really hard-to-believe stories with certainty."

Come back like 4 years later and lo and behold....it was the same one. Same EXACT one. Serial number matched. This time it was being sold used for 1800$. But I had my Les Paul by this time.....although I had the money to buy this girl...

I let her go. I had mine. She still played and sounded like I remember. Her bends and tones were sweet and aggressive. Perfection.

2333,"This section always give me chills:

&gt; “Perhaps the greatest faculty our minds possess is the ability to cope with pain. Classic thinking teaches us of the four doors of the mind, which everyone moves through according to their need.

&gt; First is the door of sleep. Sleep offers us a retreat from the world and all its pain. Sleep marks passing time, giving us distance from the things that have hurt us. When a person is wounded they will often fall unconscious. Similarly, someone who hears traumatic news will often swoon or faint. This is the mind's way of protecting itself from pain by stepping through the first door.

&gt; Second is the door of forgetting. Some wounds are too deep to heal, or too deep to heal quickly. In addition, many memories are simply painful, and there is no healing to be done. The saying 'time heals all wounds' is false. Time heals most wounds. The rest are hidden behind this door.

&gt; Third is the door of madness. There are times when the mind is dealt such a blow it hides itself in insanity. While this may not seem beneficial, it is. There are times when reality is nothing but pain, and to escape that pain the mind must leave reality behind. 

&gt; Last is the door of death. The final resort. Nothing can hurt us after we are dead, or so we have been told.”

2336,"There was a girl on OKC that openly stated she was pregnant (not much of a baby bump yet) but separated from the father.

I thought she was cute. I wasn't sure what to think about the pregnancy (my best relationship was an affair, so I've walked into drama before), but I just thought that was really admirable of her to not be afraid to put herself back out there because of the pregnancy. Hell, she seemed more confident than me, this was just the 5th or 6th girl I ever messaged on the site and ""online dating"" was still weird to me and none of my conversations had led to an actual date yet. I just messaged her telling her I commended her for her confidence in herself, nothing more or any intentions to take things further than that. Just an internet thumbs up.

We actually hit it off really well. Exchanged numbers within just a few messages and carried on really long text conversations. You know, that feeling where it doesn't feel like the usual routine of online dating but more that you're actually connecting and enjoying just talking. We were laughing and enjoying each other enough I just went for it - asked her out. She said yes without hesitation, emoji and all.

The day of the date (Thursday), there's no contact. As the hours come closer, I text and call to see if we were still on (was still newish to online dating, wasn't aware ghosting was common). Was pretty bummed because we had hit it off so well.

I sent an occasional text asking if she was ok every other day. One phone call, but I guess she just had second thoughts about me? I really had no clue. (none of the texts were over-intrusive, just once every other day at most) And our texting wasn't just casual flirting, so I really would expect her to like me enough to come out and say she had second thoughts if that was the case.

I'm feeling defeated about it at this point so I don't really care that another call on Sunday will probably go unanswered. She surprisingly answers. This is the first time we talked on the phone. I said ""it's ____ from OKC. Everything ok?""

""Yeah, can I call you back? There are cops at my door right now, and I just got back from the hospital.""

She texts back a few hours later apologizing. She had actually come down with awful internal pain the day of the date and went to the hospital. Turns out she had gallstones (apparently somewhat common during pregnancy?) She didn't want to risk the baby's life with surgery to remove the gallstones, so she decided to just try and fight through the pain. 

We actually continued talking since then another two weeks. She shared how she was feeling as far as dealing with the pain and pregnancy. I never pressured her - just told her my offer to take her out to dinner still stands if she can find the energy to leave the house. She appreciated it and told me she would let me know when the pain feels more manageable.

One day she told me she went home from work early because the pain was really bad, and probably going to take a nap. Her parents were checking in on her still, so she would be ok.

And that was the last time I ever heard from her............
I feel bad. I don't even care about the date anymore, I just wanted to know she was still ok. Even if we weren't compatible or it wouldn't work out with the situation, I still liked her as a person. I've sent occasional texts. I called maybe once a week. Nothing.

I now know ghosting is a thing, but this one hurt. I just want to know she's ok... =("

330,000 is less than 1% of our current population. Are we really going to say we can't figure out a way to cope with an increase of the population by 1% a year? Our problem is that we are an aging population with longer life expectancies and we voted for austerity.

I even had one of them pull me aside to apologize for not seeing how fucked she was.

Then about a year later, she started dating one of my friends (a pattern she seems to have), and ended up being the reason he cut off all his friends, which she was always trying to make me do.

It might take a while, but if she's as bad as it sounds, people will eventually start to see it."

2399,"Physicist here.

It's actually particularly interesting when people mention the physics of video games being impossible or simply unrealistic, as there are some games that are surprisingly conceivable in a realistic situation possible in this universe. I've actually developed an advanced algorithm in conjunction with Sir John Bayes, a physicist currently working at Johns Hopkins University, that takes into account a vast array of variables within the game environment.

I've run Super Mario Galaxy through this algorithm, which takes into account factors such as relative volume, supposed densities in correlation to known speeds such as gravity, buoyancy and horseshoe crabs present in the game. 

I've come to the conclusion that the game Super Mario Galaxy for the Wii CAN be physically possible, assuming that the net charge of the quasars aligns to a total of 4.72 degrees, according to Copenhagen's law of cognitive disequilibrium, AND also ensuring that the hawking radiation of the shell material within the game remains proportional to the speed of multiverse shells, which is a rather rare instance.

But ultimately, it is possible."

After Palin left, the cop hung around for a little while, shooting the shit with my manager while she closed down registers. Out of nowhere, this teen comes running in through the door and starts hurling eggs at the display of bestsellers at the front of the store. He got off about a dozen before the shocked cop took him down.

I had my feet on the dash and i wasnt wearing anything inderneath, and i wasnt paying attention so when a guy pulled up next to me, he got an eyefull of pussy. That was fun. I kinda glanced at him out the corner of my eye and started rubbing myself, he was practically drooling. Kid in his twenties, after i pulled out he followed me and made hand signals like, wait! I laughed at him, blew him a kiss, and took a different turn.

So I finally relented and went to watch the movie, when they handed me my 3D glasses I was a bit questionable about them. I remember asking the ticket lady why she handed me a pair of sunglasses to go watch a movie in a dark room with. She just chuckled at my naivety and explained they were polarized lenses and that everything would make sense when the movie came on.

2 1/2 hours later I had one of the best movie experiences ever. The movie was a bit mediocre but the 3D drew you into it and made it a truly one of a kind experience. I still to this day have not seen anything come close to the level of detail that was shown in Avatar and the complexity of some of the 3D shots. Funnily enough the closest I have come to that level of 3D is with the 2013 Tomb Raider game, which has an awesome 3D effect."

2503,"This will almost certainly get buried, but here goes. About a week ago my 16 month old son woke up screaming in the middle of the night, which is uncharacteristic for him. I ran in his room to rescue him. When I picked him up to soothe him he immediately pointed out to the dark hallway and said ""dog-og"", his word for dog. My 10 year old dog passed away from heart failure in March and the only other pet we have is a cat, who my son calls ""kiki"". I told him there was no dog out there and he pointed and said it again. It freaked me out a bit, but I wrote it off as a half-asleep toddler being silly. I put him back to bed and went back to sleep myself. The next morning, my husband tells me he had a crazy dream. He went downstairs for water and saw Stella, my deceased dog, in the dining room. He knew she shouldn't be there, so he gets close to her and realizes she looks like herself except she has the eyes of an owl. Her face then contorted into a quasi-guilty look, almost like the one she would give us when she had gotten into the garbage, except a creepier versiom. He freaked out and started kicking at her and she disappeared into the wall. He then came back upstairs, hearing Stella's footsteps behind him on the stairs. He climbed back in bed and heard her characteristic getting comfy noises at the foot of the bed. He then woke up. Now, I had not yet told him about our son pointing to a dog in the middle of the night and I had even turned off the monitor before going into my son's room (something we both do, so that the one who stays in bed can try to get back to sleep), so my husband couldn't have heard anything. We're both pretty big paranormal skeptics, but we both admitted it was creepy.  Later that afternoom my friend and her almost 2 year old came to visit. Almost immediately after they arrived her daughter ran into our dining room and started yelling ""puppy!"" over and over while pointing to an empty corner. I felt a shiver go down my spine.

The dryer they delivered didn't heat. They refused to fix it, said it was an issue with the vent being clogged; and if they came out and found no error they'd charge us more than a chimney sweep... So, we swept the vent - nothing, the sweep was like ""uhh what did you call me this is spotless?"" - with that taken care of, go back to the store, tell them it isn't the vent, here's the sweep's receipt - come fucking fix it.

They drag their ass, finally agree to send someone to look; he says ""oh, we're not authorized to repair that"" - wtf so much for having ""authorized seller &amp; technicians"" in your window...

Arrange with company (LG) to send a real tech over to fix it under warranty. They discover it's not fixable, say they'll authorize the exchange with the local shop (the local shop refused to exchange is until LG authorized the exchange)... Local shop says ""that'll be $100 - you bought it on sale and that sale is over, so you need to pay the difference""

I immediately pull over and, in an insane instance of mistaken identity, in hops massive biker with an epic beer gut and tangle of long hair hanging over his face.  I'm 19F and about 90lbs so he looked as shocked as I must have.  I didn't know what to do so I just slowly put the car in drive and eased back into the storm.  For the next 20 minutes I motor-mouthed about how much my family loved me and would miss me.  Hacksaw, as he introduced himself, was actually really polite.  I dropped him off at the town bar so he could call his brother, Oozie.  Later when I told my SO about it he flipped his shit.  I guess those brothers had a pretty bad reputation with women.  So that was my only time picking up a hitchhiker.

I didnt know who this man was, i had never seen him before in my life and before i could come to any sense to call the cops my cousin had bolted out of the door and ran to my grandpas house. He remarked ""huh wonder whats wrong with him?"" and then sat there staring at me. To this day i dont know what took him so damn long but it felt like 5 minutes of pure eye contact, as if any moment he would jump up and assault me. Grandpa finally walked through the door, had me and my cousin go outside and then spoke with the man. A few minutes later grandpa came out with the man and called his folks to come get him, turns out he was from out of state and was visiting our neighbors across the street who was also his family. He also happened to have a severe case of dimentia and walked through my front door thinking it was theirs and thought my cousin and I was his grandsons. I felt so bad for the guy and had never heard of the disease until then. "

2575,"Looking back at US history, there's always been at least some level of anti-immigration sentiment; every major immigrant group (Irish, Italian, Chinese, among others) has had to carve out space for themselves against nationalists.  After a few generations, they were part of the American experiment, a testament to opportunity in the US.

Are current nationalist trends (Brexit in the UK, anti-immigration in the US, among others) a step up, or is this the same level?  It seems more real and immediate to me now as I live through it; but I'm young, and don't know what it really was like 50 or 100 years ago, other than what I've read in history books.  This is an honest question: is this a spike compared to the last few decades, or is it a spike compared to the last few hundred years?  I'm assuming the former, but don't really know."

SOMEONE BROKE INTO HIS HOUSE AND CLEANED IT.

He called the cops but they couldn't figure out whether a crime had been committed, because... nothing was missing. 

Turned out the landlord had accidentally installed identical locks for him and the apartment next door, and the next door apartment had hired a housecleaner, who then forgot which exact number it was, but having a key, came in and figured ""if the key fits, this must be the mess..."" 

He later hired that same housekeeper, because she'd done an amazing job."

2601,"&gt;I cannot understand how a spouse can b so spineless and allow a parent to abuse their partner.  
  
It's because they've been conditioned to. Now I can't speak for the people who then undermine their spouse's feelings about it and argue with them that it's not a big deal. I guess it's just a coping mechanism to help them to continue to avoid the issue. But I've slunk away because I could smell a drunken tirade from my dad coming. I asked my husband to come to bed with me but he was doing something with his laptop or phone. He finally did an hour and a half later. An hour and a half full of drunken screaming from my dad and calm rationality from my husband while I cried in the next room with my hands over my ears so I wouldn't have to listen. Two years later and I'm still ashamed I didn't put a stop to it.  
Some people can take the anger caused by parental mistreatment and use it as motivation for change to a healthier life. Some people sink into the same negative behavioural patterns they grew up witnessing because they internalize the anger and point it at themselves. It's complicated. Good for you for cutting your parents off. It's taken me a long time to realise that what I keep expecting from my parents is never coming."

For instance, in my current profession (teacher at a private, Catholic school), it's frowned upon for the female teachers to wear a lot of makeup. We're expected to have a more ""natural"" look. But I'm a huge makeup geek, so that ""natural look"" that I wear everyday still involves about 10-12 products. I'm still wearing medium-coverage foundation, and concealer, and mascara and blush and highlighter and primer and bronzer and penciling in my eyebrows and putting on nude lipstick. 

Does it *look* like I'm wearing a lot of makeup? I really don't think so, as I've had multiple people tell me that they're jealous of ""how clear my skin looks without makeup"" (LOL). Also, I would have been reprimanded by my principal by now, if it indeed looked like I was ""caking it on"".

When I'm with a guy, I find being passive easier. That way nothing is my fault. Things go wrong? He's the asshole, the stupid one. Nothing happens? He's lazy. Boring. Shy. I guess it stems from my own insecurities. I mean, if I'm the one making the moves, then when something goes wrong *I'm* the one to blame. Best to avoid it all together.

He was 12.  He accidently killed a 6 year old while play wrestling. He was sentenced to life without parole. After, I think 2 years in jail, it got overturned and he was released on 10 years of parole.  He violated parole for possessing a 8inch knife, got a couple months in prison and 5 more years of parole. A few years later he stole $33 worth of pizza from a deliveryman (at gunpoint supposedly, but no gun was every recovered), and then he beat up a friend of his that was getting the pizza delivered to him apartment. He got 10 years in jail for that crime, and 30 years in jail for violating parole.

He *is* serving life in jail now, and its because he was thrown into the system and prison at age 12, and probably has PTSD from it and is fucked up for life because of it.

Basically just instantly become my own best friend. Me and my clone can take turns attending my job, one day on and one day off and whoever gets to stay home can spend a few hours doing some cooking/cleaning at home and life would be so much easier. I say best friend because I think I'm hilarious but other people don't always appreciate my sense of humor, so I would make sure to laugh at all of my clones jokes as I am sure my clone would also think I am hilarious. We would share deep conversations and almost always agree with eachother, I think sometimes I would have to pretend to disagree with my clone just to keep things interesting but we obviously would agree on pretty much everything and who doesn't want someone to agree with them on just about everything? We would never fight either because I'm not a fan of interpersonal conflict/confrontation so surely we would always be on good terms. We could play video games together, take over for one another when a situation becomes stressful or hectic sort of like a tag out type of agreement where the calm one takes over if one of us is having a hard time dealing. Read books and watch shows together and then discuss them later. It would be easy to be your own best friend because you know exactly what you want/need from a friendship. We could even share my girlfriend if she was okay with that (of course she would be because I am awesome). Also both of my kids would always have their dad with them even when they are apart or doing separate things which I'm sure they would enjoy but they might get confused/weirded out when we were both in the same room.

I have dreamed of this scenario and I think personally I would love it, my only concern is that others might be creeped out or perceive the arrangement to be morally wrong or just plain weird. I'm not at all joking about any of this, I would be perfectly okay with having a clone of myself. I wouldn't have much need for other male friends if I had a clone because they would all pale in comparison to my double.

Oh and I would totally use my clone to play tricks on people, make people think I was in two different places at the same time, etc etc. Basically everything you would or might want to do if you had an identical twin. Plus you'd basically have a replacement to take over for the other if there was ever a horrible accident or incident that killed one of us. Basically it would be the best thing ever."

That extra 8e9 would push the radius to the order of 10m, which one could imagine having a house.

2926,"You go from that stage of ""love is blind"" where you each look for the best in each other, you each see faults through rose-colored, obscuring, forgiving glass and choose to love the foibles, and you each see virtues with clarity, to the opposite.

A relationship has a chance a long term success if each of you learn to preserve the ability to maintain the positive outlook and avoid the negative.  Your ""fights"" are about finding win-win solutions and resolutions.  You take seriously St Paul's advice -- never let the sun go down on your anger, because you realize that anger that lasts overnight is a bigger enemy than whatever the issue is.  With each resolution, you build mutual trust in each other's commitments to working things out rather than ""winning.""  To a degree, it's a matter of choice and a learned skill--if the two of you can make the choice to stay that way for 100 small issues, then it becomes a self-sustaining commitment to each other that makes the big issues easy. 

If one of you starts nit-picking chicken shit issues early in the relationship, that's not a good sign.

Both states are strongly self-reinforcing and self-sustaining -- whichever cycle you're in, it will get stronger with time.  I agree with the observations below--John Gottman's books are the best in the field.

When I returned back to my table, I peeked into the half-open kitchen and noticed this heavy-set, sweaty, shirtless sole kitchen worker who seemed busy preparing meatballs. Besides the guy not wearing a shirt or food service gloves, something felt off and when I glanced again, I noticed that the guy was nonchalantly grabbing chunks of ground meat from one container, then proceeded to rolling the meat on his fat belly, before dropping the prepared meatballs onto a food tray.

2934,"The thing about threesome's, is it is three different individuals with three different personalities and sexual likes/dislikes. Sexual tendencies and sexual chemistry definitely come into play.  It's not always about two women pleasuring the guy, sometimes the guy is more of a third wheel, and sometime there is an equal distribution. From my experience with multiple MFF threesomes, I can sat they are pretty much always different. Sometimes everyone is on the same page, some times they are absolutely not. With threesomes you really have to be able to be reactive, and kind of go with the sexual flow. Pleasing two women at once can be done, after all we men have a mouth, tongue, hands, and speech, and not just a dick to work with. That being said having sexual experience and confidence can be a gigantic help.  No matter what though, threesomes definitely have the potential to be complicated. Having specific expectations for a threesome is good way for them end to end up in disaster.  They key to a threesome is that everyone has to be completely on board, if one person is not fully on board it's probably going to go bad."

2940,"Moved into the second story of a house when I was a sophomore in undergrad. I thought I had it made with two bedrooms and two balconies to myself for a very reasonable price ($600 back in 2004). The house was an old farmhouse from the late 1800's but in good condition. Original woodwork and all that.

Four months go by and October looms. I just adopted a cat about 1 year old who had the run of the place while I was away. I started to notice that the cat refused to enter the kitchen. No big deal, I'll just move the food into the living room for now. The cat would no longer enter either bedroom. Not the worst situation, still, I catered to the cat still and moved the litter box closer. 

Well then some noises started coming from the bathroom. Pots and pans falling kind of noises. I had no idea what was going on, figuring the radiators were old and having some fun with me or something.

It was about this time the plumbing in the bathroom went wild. Faucets would flow randomly, or leak intensely and then shut off. I had this amazing claw foot tub from the early 1900's that I loved to soak in. One day, in the tub, the lights flickered. The flickering continued for a bit so I decided to call my landlord who lived about 6 hours away. I wanted to see if he knew of existing issues or not and have him fix them if time permitted. It wasn't the biggest deal in the world, after all.

Let's call him Jim for the sake of anonymity.

""Hey Jim, this is Patrick from the house you're renting up in the city.""
""Hey Patrick, what's going on?""
""Well I've been noticing some odd plumbing and electrical problems recently. Did the previous tenant have any issues?""
A short pause. Jim was thinking, ""No, no. Not that I'm aware of.""
I explained the issues and we set a date that he would come up and take a look. He was a handyman and looking to save some money, so he'd do it himself.

The next week I'm speaking with my downstairs neighbor and asking if he has had issues. He talks like Boomhauer from King of The Hill, but I've learned to decipher his speech over the months. He's a severely injured vet from some war, not sure which one- mentally and physically.

My neighbor confesses he has seen and heard of no situations like the ones I'm having upstairs, but he'd keep an eye out. I asked if the previous tenant had any problems...

He stared me down. ""You didn't know?"" I shake my head..

Apparently the previous tenant was the original owner of the house. She sold it 20 some odd years ago to the current owner, Jim. She grew up in the house. It was her childhood home. She died in the bathtub 2  years prior. The one I soak in. I'm the newest tenant since.

I'm not one to believe in the paranormal, though I do love the fantastical thought of most of the stories. I also tried to shake what I was thinking for days afterwards. Too many coincidences added up. The cat not leaving the living room, the weird issues only I'm having with the electrical (To the point where the radio would blast at night). My imagination ran wild until one day I decided to confront the situation.

I googled (maybe back then I used something else) ""How to get rid of ghosts"" and came up with various results on rituals to perform. I decided on a relatively lazy one, because why go to effort if I don't really believe in this shit, right? It involved sage, some words, some cardinal directions. Doesn't matter- I didn't do it.

I put a nail on the wall that was shared with the bathroom. From that nail I hung some dried sage and the piece of paper printed at my local college. It's embarrassing to think about it now, but I pointed at the paper and loudly proclaimed (to an empty bedroom), ""Hey, lady. We're cool here. But if we're not then I'm going to perform this ritual step by step. Do you know what happens then? I don't, so let's just be cool.""

After that I didn't have any random radio explosions or leaky faucets. My landlord came and clunked around a week later anyways, trying to ascertain where my issues were. 

A year later I was getting a new lower-neighbor. Within the next 3 months from my stance his cat died. His dog then died 3 months later. Then he died. Shortly after that the house became infested with bats, and the bats brought a massive pile of bedbugs. I had to burn everything and move.

So yeah. I burned the goddamn sage, too.

You have to capture a disinterested consumer's attention in maybe a couple seconds and straight numbers don't really capture that, especially when you're convoluting the numbers by using fractions.  You also need to stick to terms that are familiar to the consumer, quarters and halves are more familiar than thirds.

Secondly I'm not ""fully equipped"" - physically as I'm lacking the parts most guys have, and prosthetics can only do so much. It'll be years on a waiting list, plus months of recovery time for me to have something half useable downstairs. I'll never be able to have kids, either (the only reason I can fathom for wanting sex in the first place). And thirdly, I'm an unattractive (plus I look about 14 and half my face is scarred up from an accident), socially awkward, overweight nerd whose idea of Netflix and Chill would be to just watch the movie, no cheekiness involved. The chances of me having a partner I'm willing to do something that frankly grosses me out that much for, and is into me as much is quite slim. Probably going to be a wizard."

2983,"There's been a couple, but the most unsettling was about 7 years ago. I had the house to myself for the weekend and had let the dog out the back to pee pretty late in the night. 
I'd gone out with her to have a look at the stars and moon seeing as it was clear for once, pretty rare in Wales. A few minutes later I hear low growling noise, it's the dog. She was on the patio, with a defensive stance and growling up at the roof, which was strange enough seeing as I'd never heard her growl in years. 
I look up where she's looking and the best way to describe it would be as a large but skinny creature. It looked like a human from the silhouette I could see, but hunched on all fours, a large bulbous head maybe twice the size of a man's and limbs that seemed have an extra joint or very long hands. It walked from one end of the roof to the other and I got the distinct impression that it was looking at me. 
I pretty much shat myself, dragged the dog inside and locked the doors and windows. 
The dog insisted on staying in my room that night, and she would lift her head up anytime there was an odd scratching noise from the attic. 

Never saw anything like that again after that night, dog went back to never staying in my room and all was well. It just creeped me out something fierce, especially since it looked so solid, like an actual thing and not a ghost or whatever. "

The fact that you only have two parties is not just a result of the people's decision. The US have passed several anti list fusion laws in the XXth century, making third parties harder to be elected into office. Also, the electoral college gives some states unbalanced privileges and awards electoral votes in a very inconsistent manner.

There's a long-simmering societal battle between conservatives and liberals that mirrors, in many ways, the US's social paradigm. The liberals are currently winning, and ironically, the reason why is mostly terrorism and its effects in the last decade+, coupled with economic conditions which have been radically exacerbated by the collapse of oil, which have combined to push the agenda firmly towards the liberal side's arguments. 

There's many other factors in play here; the government's desire to modernize the economy, the desire to fix the country's image *internally*, and the realization that the monarchy won't survive society's fractionalization, an effect of Saudi society's creep towards the left, without throwing their weight behind liberal programs that tie in with economic development.

 In the latter's case, they've come to embrace progressivism where they can (and where it doesn't threaten their power), and are trying to steer society towards a compromise between traditionalists and progressives at all levels, including the monarchy itself, using the economy as the central argument for the necessity of reforms.

The biggest surprise was that the current king, having always been known as a staunch traditionalist with a strong disciplinarian attitude, turned out to be the most liberal, reform minded king, more so than the former king, who was *also* from the traditionalist side, but was a staunch reformer and progressive."
3015,"If you have a bunch of sexist behaviors ingrained into you, conscious or not, if you continually enact them you are sexist regardless of your awareness of it. Part of the way sexism and racism perpetuate themselves is by hiding themselves in the agent's ignorance. Most sexists and racists don't think they're sexist or racist. 

Sexism and racism are not attitudinal, it's not about me not liking you for a stupid superficial reason; they're structural, meaning the behavior reinforces an existing power differential that keeps an entire class of people subjugated to another. 

And yes, I agree that women are also typically ignorant of the way that men are socialized to behave. Gender hurts everybody. "

Um, there's no gluten in these but I'll be sure to let the kitchen know that other snacks are preferred. ""Yes you do that, not like I havent told three of your people already but you and your staff need to know how we feel out here, which is disappointed."" This kind of thing continued all night: she ripped me a new one for clearing some cookies, still in their wrappers and put out as favors, but were either smashed or coated in food from dinner, saying ""hardly anyone got their cookies and I suppose thats because you've been snatching them, well I know how much these people paid for these and ALL of them need to be collected""; she boxed up ALL leftovers in her own Tupperware containers for the guests to take home, running around and fussing over it all night, and telling servers to put half eaten plates of food down when trying to clear them, telling me the brides mum was a single mum and needed this extra food, and ""can you wrap the flowers in tin foil (?) for guests to take home?"" blah blah blah.. she had a way of turning a request into a five minute rant and I could go on, but basically, I felt the resting bitch face I had going on from start of shift, to finish, thanks to that woman."

3050,"Let's try to keep this answer as balanced as possible ... 

She came to power in 1979 on the back of nationwide strikes; a failing economy; recent entry to the EU (EEC); and a whole lot of other woes. Her stance was a free market economy, private ownership and de-regularisation.

This erupted into a face off between government and unions which she was determined not to lose. The end result was that massive parts of the (seriously failing) manufacturing sector closed down. The mining industry was obliterated. Ship/car/steel/you name it industries gone. If you can picture the UK, that meant the midlands; the north east; the west of Scotland; and, Wales were decimated. 4 million people out of work. Still, the financial sector boomed. London was always strong but became not just a European centre for finance, it ruled the world. Oh, and you were allowed to buy the house that you previously rented ... if you weren't flat broke.

The entire government would have been voted out in 1984 except that we had ourselves a little war against Argentina and kicked arse. She swept through the next elections with a landslide victory on the back of jingoitsic nationalism and the party remained in power for more than a decade.

The true hero of that later time was the little grey man, John Major. While no-one really took any notice of him he did the job of any great accountant and put the whole economy on an incredible footing that we hadn't seen since before the second world war. So, of course, we voted him out of office and brought in Tony Blair instead. He strolled in to the sort of surplus that would make Bush want to wage two wars instead of just one; proclaimed the end of ""boom and bust"" economics while spending everything that had been gathered over the preceding terms. Of course, even Tony wasn't fool enough to invest in those areas that were still deprived ... but he did put up a [nice statue](http://www.antonygormley.com/uploads/images/0312_angelofthenorth_1998_003_sallyannnorman.jpg) near his constituency. Anyway, that's about when we entered a global recession and Tony retired to bring his blessed touch to the Middle East as the world's Peace Envoy leaving Gordon Brown to take the heat (he actually deserved most of the blame that came his way) and usher a new ""caring"" conservatism back into office. They still haven't done much to help those manufacturing areas either. And that brings us up to date. (Of course with huge parts missing).

Those areas I described as deprived are now the home to Japanese companies. They don't employ the sort of numbers that the older industries did. They don't pay as well. The unions are a shadow of what they were. The indians bought our steel industry. The rest just slowly melted away. 

EDIT: re-reading some of the things I've written today I realise that not only can I not say de-regulation, I can't spell it either. Just leaving that there, though, because it's one of the few things that's made me smile in the last 16 hours

The fun part is that the Japanese car makers set up in the UK in order to avoid tariffs on their cars being sold in the EU. If you make a car in an EU country, you can export that car to other EU countries without attracting taxes. More than that, if you make *enough* cars in the EU, you don't have to pay tariffs on the cars that you make elsewhere. Everyone wins. Unless, of course, the country that you chose to put your nice new factory in decides to leave the EU ... then you have to pay all those nasty tariffs. Or you could just fire everyone and re-site to Poland the next time you bring out a new model and have to change your production lines again...."

It was our third date, we had only really known each other for a few weeks. Everything had been nice and normal, and he suggested that we went to this fairly average restaurant (which I can now no longer return to) in town for our third date, pretty standard stuff. We arrived and everything was perfectly nice and normal as we ate our appetisers, then our entrees, and I was having a nice time. 
Then the shitshow started. 
After our entrees had been cleared away the restaurant dimmed the lights and began playing this really awful cliche 'romantic' instrumental music. The guy stands up and makes this emotional speech about how amazing I am and how he cherishes our life together (third date?????) and all this other tacky shit about how great we are together. The entire restaurant was watching as he got down on one knee with this ring box opened asking me to marry him, and I'm just sitting there absolutely fucking horrified. 
I tried to be polite at first and said maybe we should talk about this privately and shut the ring box, but this just caused him to burst into tears and run off to the bathroom, with several staff members rushing after him (presumably) to console him. 
I have NO idea what he told the staff about me or our 'relationship' while he had been setting all this up but I was getting some of the worst looks I've ever seen from them (and some of the other patrons), and then the head waitress came over and asked me to leave immediately and not come back. I was still in absolute shock so just grabbed my bag and coat and left as the entire place silently watched me over the sounds of him loudly crying in the bathroom. 
Was about 3-4 years ago now and I've never been back to that restaurant, doubt I could face it again. "

3146,"Reading Murakami absorbs you and gives you texture and feeling and smell and these other senses you don't usually get in a book.  It's erotic, but at the same time not sexual.  1Q84 may be one of the only books where I've read the description ""Needs to get fucked really hard"" and felt empathy, rather than arousal.

There's this one description in Wind-Up Bird of a guy's green neck tie that I ended up reading like a dozen times before I moved on...can't remember where it is, but I felt warmer after reading it.

He has this way of describing the world around him that makes it feel both comfortable and uncomfortable at the same time.  It's that blending of multiple narratives, the interweaving of character stories.  It shouldn't work, but it does somehow.

Anyways, if you like Murakami, you should try out Karen Tei Yamashita.  Tropic of Orange has a similar feel to it."

I've always had goals in my mind and with that kind of money, I'd accomplish all of my goals and use the rest for either selfish spending (large house, nice clothes, hundreds of pets and people to service my house like maids and chefs and whatnot), spending on my friends and family (which I do now even though I'm basically broke), and whatever I decided I didn't need/want would go to animal charities/shelters etc. because thats what I care about.

I can 100% honestly tell you that I know that no matter what kind of money I run into, I won't turn into an asshole who literally assaults people for fun. I got through high school without even so much as taking a sip from any sort of alcohol, I got through college without it as well.... despite everyone and their grandmothers telling me ""Oh don't worry, you'll be drinking by the time you get to college"".

Point is, having a strong will is important. Knowing the difference between right and wrong is more important. No amount of money would be able to change how I feel about doing the wrong thing.

People really need to think before they give out uninformed advice. Especially when it comes to mental health (or any health, for that matter, beyond basic first aid). It's given with the best intentions. Unfortunately intentions aren't worth anything when they're not backed up by knowledge, when it comes to something like this.

Medical professionals study for years because they want to help people, but realize that they need the proper knowledge to do so.  Yes, there are some people that go through the process and, frankly, learn nothing. It happens, just like with engineers, mathematicians, pilots... any profession you can name. Some are even in it for the wrong reasons. However the vast majority simply want to help their fellow humans get better through some of the worst times of their lives.

But what is far more damaging is to tell someone that, ""It's wrong to take your prescribed medicine."" If you really are worried that those medications aren't helping the person you care about, tell them to go back and talk to their medical professional and see about changing things up. Or to get a second opinion. Never suggest they simply stop taking something unless it's clearly and unambiguously life-threatening.

3164,"Not the person you were responding to, but I'm a similar straight-A student, albeit slightly younger.

For me really, it's not a fear of failure.  It's just an unwillingness to put in the time, since I really value my free time.  Some subjects I adore studying for, and really don't mind it, but when it comes to the really dry ones, it feels like pulling teeth. 

The fear of failure really drives me to study, actually, not the opposite.  ""I didn't care"" doesn't really hold up as a defence to me, and I feel that getting A's and being on top is a necessity for me.  In order to protect the ego, gotta get A's.

I'm a bit scared that my tactics are going to fail down the line, so I've been incrementally improving my work ethic.  In both cases, I think fear is a better motivator for me, oddly."

3176,"I used to work as a referee at a Men's hockey league that required all players to have helmet stickers to prove they had signed the leagues insurance waiver.  (sign the waiver, get the sticker, put it on your helmet and you can play)  It was really common for guys to be too lazy to walk upstairs to the office and get their stickers so we would constantly have to bother them during a game to go and get one immediately.  

So one Friday night I go up to a guy without a sticker and tell him to go get one, he tells me that the office told him they ran out of stickers and he could play.  So I let him continue to play while I get my timekeeper to radio my convenor who then had to call the office and check the guy's story.  Turns out he lied to me, the office had plenty of stickers and he was just being lazy (this was annoyingly common).  

So I blow my whistle at the next stoppage of play and go over to tell him that he lied but that since it was now the last half of the third period I would let him play but that he had to get one before his next game.  His team played back to back games that night so I would know for sure that he got one and didn't mid doing him that favour.  He agreed and thanked me for being cool about it to my face but as I skated away he called me a fucking idiot.  I in turn assessed a game misconduct for abuse of official which in that league carried an automatic one game suspension and would force him to miss his next game.  He didn't like this and cursed me out more before leaving the ice.

After that game as I was walking back to the ice for this guy's team's next game he came up to me and apologized to me which was nice, that is until he then asked me to let him play in the next game.  I promptly told him not a chance and walked away, he cursed me out again but had to sit out the game and all for a sticker that he could have easily gotten by walking upstairs to the league office.

TLDR: suspended a belligerent hockey player from a back to back game for not getting a helmet sticker."

In particular it was what they did with the president, Rainier Wolfcastle...or should I say [Schwarzenegger](http://content7.flixster.com/question/56/37/17/5637173_std.jpg)?  The show has had a character that was a very literal parody of Schwarzenegger for 20+ years.  But apparently someone thought that was too subtle or something?  So they slightly modified the character art, used the same voice as Wolfcastle, but named the character Schwarzenegger.

There were other things that bugged me about the movie too but as a hardcore fan I can see why *maybe* they didn't want to appeal as much to me.  I thought for example that the head of the EPA should have just been Hank Scorpio instead.  They brought back the voice actor for Scorpio to have him play a power-crazed guy with a villainous plot...only to create a new character.  But I can accept that yes, that episode aired 20 years ago so while I would have liked a nod to it I can at least explain it away.

But the Rainier Wolfcastle thing...that's not some obscure reference that only hardcore fans would get.  Big buff actor with an Austrian accent and name?...it's not exactly a subtle joke.  Just deciding to change the name of the character rather than letting it be a parody was insulting."

3183,"Your car, and most German luxury cars, have anti-knock sensors. So the gas is bad but your engine is just managing it. I wouldn't let gas sit beyond 2-3 months, it starts leaving a fine residue on the tank/injectors. Also, if you're not driving at least once every two weeks for 15 minutes on the highway, your battery is going to take a shit before half of it's life is up. Not to mention it may also cause issues with your engine oil, which also deteriorates even without use (should be replaced once a year, check your owners manual about very low mileage/storage).

I learned all this from having a carbureted motorcycle that needed constant repairs. It sat for 7 months and wouldn't start. Turns out the gas was useless (it was premium and wouldn't work in my weed whacker either) and the battery wouldn't hold a charge beyond five minutes.

3265,"Not the person you replied to but I have worked in EMS on and off in the past. I have seen some cops be awesome, but most cops have a near pathological need to be in control of every situation. I understand many times it's part of the job but a huge portion of them seem to really get off on it. 

I have had officers not arrest friends/former officers who clearly beat their wives or wrapped their car around a tree when there too drunk to every remember their name. I have responded to a call where a teenage girl showed signs of excessive mace, as well as facial bruising and a broken nose (they beat the shit out of her). Responded to a call where a young woman had taken 3 entire bottle of prescription medication in an attempted suicide, but mysteriously had a broken leg, along with bruising along her entire right side and a clearly recently broken table and countertop on scene (all mysteriously missing from the officers report but present in all mine mind you). That last one could have been because she was extremely incoherent after ODing on all that medication and could have required detaining, she did attempt to attack me in the rig. but I would expect all that to be in the report if that was the case. And those are just there terrible things that could clearly be pinned on them. Combine their general lack of caring about out patients, their laziness in securing scenes for us, and general superior attitude I don't have a great deal of respect for officers as a whole. 

Again, there are many who were fantastic, caring, people. Many who assisted me in ousting some of the more serious offenses. Many who put their health and jobs at risk to assist in moving patients. Many who risked their lives to protect myself or others. But just like the military, most people become join because it pays best when you can't do much else and the ""good ones"" seem to be outnumbered. 

It does seem to be improving somewhat though as I have noticed many department are adopting stricter hiring requirements. I have worked with 4 total departments in depth and one extremely lightly. And the stricter the hiring practices always seemed to correlate with better officers. One had very high standards, and payed the best in the immediate area and they were down right pleasant to work with, they really cared about their residents, exercised restraint, and would often even hang around after we left the scene and help clean up (when possible) with the family. Or in the case of domestic dispute make sure the kids would be ok. And it was obvious the less a department payed the officers, or when they didn't thoroughly vet each candidate, surprise surprise, they were terrible. "

It's all about labels and compartmentalising people. You aren't you. You are the collection of powerless labels some while ladies have come up with. 

I think that people would be more open to it if contemporary feminists who are popular were actually well versed in history, politics, and philosophy like they used to be. 

That being said, there's no shortage of militant feminist ideology and it's nothing new. It just used to be the fringe and has become much more mainstream lately. I'd safely say we're in a new wave and it's not one of the better ones by far."

It just makes them feel like you're happy to shit on other women, and that you'd be perfectly happy to talk like this about them as soon as they ceased to be of value to you. At least I think that way. I'd never want to date someone who consistently insulted other women, even if they were trying to compliment me."

3330,"Alrightie kids here's your story. 

So I used to be a missionary in the southern part of Arizona and parts of New Mexico. It sucked a lot and never doing that again. One of the areas I was assigned to was a town called Picture Rocks. It's northwest of Tucson out in the middle of nowhere near Saguaro National Park. A rule that I had while serving there was to never ever go exploring at night. Weird and crazy shit would happen if you did go out exploring or driving down a road you're not supposed to. I tripped a ground sensor once and I had Border Patrol all over me complete with a Black Hawk helicopter circling us with two BP trucks boxing us in. That would make a good TIFU story. 

The guy I was assigned with had a half dozen mental disorders which made him straight up handicapped all added together. He drove the living shit out of me being chained to this motherfucker for 13 weeks. HEY PETERSEN, IF YOURE OUT THERE BUDDY FUCK YOU. 

Anyway, he was driving our truck that night and saw a dirt road less traveled up ahead that went between a bunch of cotton fields. The idea came to his mind ""hey, this looks like a cool road. Let's see where it goes!"". He turns down the road despite much of my protest since he was breaking the rule of exploring at night. I accepted our fate at said ""alright fine drive down the road but this is all on you"".

After a few miles, the road dead ends with a turn around with a bunch of overgrown trees. We turn around and drive no more than 30 meters when I see this large figure running to the left of us in one of the cotton fields. It jumps in front of our car giving us full view of what it actually is. The body was that of a human but covered in shaggy gray fur. It had a head of a wolf or some kind of dog hunched over its shoulders and running on its hind legs. I could almost hear the wheels inside my colleague's head grind to a halt with his simple minded head unable to process what we just saw. He slams on the brakes after it runs past our vehicle and I start yelling at him to not slow down and get the fuck out of there. I look to the right and see it running through the next field towards a house off in the distance. I didn't know who lived inside that house but they probably fucking died as we flew down that dirt road. "

She should only wash the exterior, not the interior. If she's washing the interior, that might be her problem. Of course, if she still smells terrible despite washing properly, she should head to the gynecologist.

Also pretty disappointed at the way the whole debate seemed to be more about throwing slurs at each other rather than talking about facts.

Now we have the prospect of Scotland going for another independence referendum, the PM has resigned, Corwyn will possibly be kicked out, and the (likely remote) possibility of NI having an independence vote. On top of that we have a couple of years of uncertainty where people (Brits living in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK) do not know what's going to happen to their lives. British businesses that needs access to the EU will not be sure what the regulatory framework will look like, and we have my favourite part of all this which is that some of the parts of Wales that voted to Leave are the ones that have received billions of pounds of EU funding, and are now demanding that EU funding shortfall is made up from UK central Govt. 

So yeah - the truth is the decision has been taken, so now we have to accept it and make the most of it. When Article 50 is invoked we have 2 years to negotiate our ""leaving"" agreement with the EU. That is separate and distinct to the agreements we'll have with the EU to work with them in the future, such as trade agreements. So the ""leaving"" agreement will take a max of 2 years, as per Article 50, but it might take many more years to come to a trade agreement with the EU as these things tend to take time. 

What happens between now and when those agreements are complete? No idea."

3462,"Split pretty much right down the middle at the moment to be honest. I like the idea of a European Union. I'm a Europhile at heart, pretty much all the countries I want to visit are within the EU and so the idea of a being closer to them is pretty cool, but the EU at the moment...I mean over the past decade it's just been crisis after crisis.

Really, the two arguments have kind of solidified around economics on the one hand and immigration on the other. 

Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition party and pro-EU (at least officially), today said there could be no controls on immigration so long as there is free movement of people in the EU. Problem is, of course we want people to come here, work and pay into the system but where does it end? Ok cool people come and plug a hole in the pensions fund, but then surely that's ultimately a pyramid scheme? 
There is a legitimate argument that the NHS, schools etc are struggling due to under funding from central government. But even if they pumped shit-loads of money into them tomorrow, surely hundreds of thousands of people arriving every year will result in greater and greater demand requiring more money so where does it end? 
The sad part of the immigration argument is that, just IMO, this seems to be more a venting of frustration at the inability or abject refusal of successive government to lower or even really address immigration. For decades, any hint of dissent against glorious multiculturalism has been branded racist, which has lead to the 'fuck the establishment' streak of many leave supporters. 

For the economy, I think that once pretty much every possible authority there is on the matter agrees that Brexit would have negative effects, you have to face up to reality. On the leave side, there seems to be a real 'fingers-in-ear' mentality around the impact leaving the EU would have. These are areas (like the southwest) that have been outragously neglected by London for so long that the prospect of losing their EU funding s a legitimate cause for concern. The promise of the money being re-directed by central government is laughable considering the ridiculously centralised way that England is governed.

So yeah, ultimately it's whichever of these two issues play the most on peoples minds as they walk towards the polling station that will determine the outcome. For what it's worth, I reckon we will stay in and hopefully that will put an end to all this for the foreseeable future."

Lots of these kids are eligible for independent living programs, where we place them in their own one-bedroom apartment with vouchers for rent, food, and expenses, and a worker to check in on them, but their parents tell them that we're lying and we want to put them in some Oliver Twist-style orphanage.

He had finished his food and was repeatedly sipping on an empty drink (I could hear the ice slurping noise when a drink is empty as he sucked).  I was sitting beside the door so immediately thought he would try to grab my laptop and run.  

I ended up placing the MacBook back in my backpack whilst still sitting down, and held onto the bag, as I binned my empty food packaging.  Sat back down and sat finishing my drink as I continued to watch this sketchy skinhead continue to face me.  

I left the 'restaurant' and he followed.  I walked maybe 200 yards the opposite way I was meant to be going and he followed.  Turned and began to walk down a set of stairs but stopped and waited once I was out of view from him, and right enough, he followed.

As he walked down the stairs, I re-emerged onto the street and started to walk home very quickly.  When he walked past me I could see something that looked like a knife in his hand.  Scariest moment of my life.  

TL;DR - Sat in Mcdonalds on MacBook and sketchy guy sits directly behind me, not eating and staring at me.  Taking him on a detour back to my home as he followed me and at a last moment did a 180 to lose him.  Turned out he probably had a knife and would've probably mugged me.  "

When the Great Depression came along the core industries of my area collapsed, leading to factory closures, high unemployment, and the disintegration of many family fortunes.

Those who used to run successful businesses and still had money left for greener pastures. Some persisted on savings and auctions of heirlooms, maintaining the pretense of prestige until they died alone in the last heated room of an empty, decaying manor. Others abandoned these shells of lost opulence and took up simpler lives in more humble abodes.

Decades later the mansions that still stood gave civic service as low income housing. Slumlords purchased the buildings out of foreclosure from the city, and - probably with bribes or simply the inattention of uncaring city inspectors - recreated them as maze-like warrens, every room, corridor and vestibule partitioned off as the last refuge of some desperate family.

The floors, here and there, still have hints of Italian marble, the gabled roofs soar beneath the tarpaper patches that cover most of the roof tiles. Hints of the grandeur that once was there can still be seen above the grime and wear of the years."

By the time they're two, they can basically have the sleep patterns of a fully grown adult - my daughter has not napped reliably during the day since around then, unless we're doing some really energetic stuff in the morning. 

If the kid is awake at 3 AM, it should be getting fed, not sitting, ignored, in a car seat while people party. That's *incredibly* unhealthy for a two year old. Leaving aside the fact that the kid's awake at 2 AM while people are partying, it's strapped into a fucking car seat and being ignored. 

That's child abuse. Those parents should be in fucking jail."
3566,"I had no idea!  Wish I knew when I visited England at 17!  I've been planning on going back at some point and I'll definitely keep that in mind!

One of the papers I did this past semester for my Master's was on how gaming (in general) enhances language acquisition.  One of the people I studied was J.P. Gee - a linguist.  He claimed that video games based on history fiction (Age of Empires/Mythology, Civilization, etc) will give a child motivation to read up on the factual accords/stories.  Brian Jacques had a similar effect on me in middle school.  Much of my time was spent looking up what stoats were, where badgers habituate, finding out pikes aren't just weapons but a type of fish too, and so much more.  Not only was the Redwall series entertaining, but it was accidentally educational for me as well!  Bravo, Brian.  Bravo."

You don't have the right to just assume people being forced to view your genitals has no effect on them.

3571,"I'm a gay dude who's pretty comfortable with sex in general.

I have a partner and we practice communicative and intentional openness/our variety of polyamory.

He has an amazing cock it's easily my favorite one. 

I love unsolicited dick pics, I think penises are so hot. I have permanent ""what's your dick like homie"" syndrome. I'm also incredibly turned on by exhibitionist tendencies, like.. someone took this picture because it excites them for me to see it! I find that super cool. 

I can't find any reason to be grossed out by them, I don't find seeing someone's penis to be a contract that I'm signing to put it in my body, I don't have to interact with it, I don't even have to keep looking at it if I don't want to. 

I personally don't like to send pic pics. I'm think I'm cute AF but I don't really like looking at photos of my body similar to how I don't like recordings of my voice. I have one or two sexy pics of my boner to trade back if boys on Grindr ask, but I don't often send them to anyone unless they are extra sweet to me ^.^.

That being said, I get it when folks don't wanna see peens. I understand it might bring up trauma for some survivors. And I don't have a solution for that. I know that personally I'm really into shedding shame about bodies and sex and this includes shame about penis size and appearance. 

I say if it makes a boy excited for me to see his hard cock I'm happy to help, and it really doesn't hurt me at all."

3574,"This was around 2006, when I was 10 years old. It was after midnight; I was sleeping in one of my aunts' bed while my brother slept in another's, adjacent to mine. Across from us was our grandparents' bedroom and downstairs, next to the laundry room, was my parents' bedroom. I woke up, groggy and confused and needing to pee very very badly, and suddenly I heard a voice. With 8 people in the house, that wasn't uncommon; someone had probably gotten up to go to the washroom and either started talking to someone else or they had answered the phone (mind you, I was still half-asleep, so to me a phone call after midnight seemed totally reasonable). Well, it turns out that couldn't have been possible because I didn't recognize the voice. *That* was what immediately woke me up, and I froze, clutching my blanket while sitting up in bed. It was a man; his voice wasn't deep, not like my dad or grandfather's; and he kept prattling on about some 'treasure'. He was right outside the door, but he never turned the doorknob or made any attempt at entering one of the rooms. He just kept passing by, as if pacing, all the while talking to himself about a 'treasure'. I was terrified and looked over to my aunt, who was sound asleep. I still don't know how I managed to not wet the bed. Eventually the voice went silent, and I somehow fell asleep. 

The next morning, everyone is doing their thing, getting ready for work or school or busy in the kitchen, so I assumed it was just a dream. 

I really wish I'd kept my mouth shut. 

As I'm eating breakfast, I told my mom and grandmother (who were both in the kitchen) about the voice, and laughed at how weird the brain is. They froze. 

*Everyone* froze. 

It turns out the voice was real. I hadn't mentioned his obsession with a 'treasure', but my grandfather did. As did my mother. And brother. Everyone agreed about the 'treasure'. 

Apparently, he combed the entire house, but he never actually entered any of the rooms. Nothing was stolen, all the doors were locked, and all the windows had screens, none of which were missing. 

Two weeks later, while I was helping my grandparents clean the garage, my grandmother found several empty Coke cans behind the old sofa, which had been up against one of the walls for quite some time. There were also empty bags of chips, candy wrappers, and fruit cores and peels. 

All of which were taken from the garage. 

The sofa was high enough for someone to lay underneath. 

He had been inside our house. Inside our garage. 

We've moved now, as have my aunts (my grandparents still live there, we're about a 3 minute drive from them), but we still don't know *who* he was, *how* he got in, and, most importantly:

*How* long had he been *inside* our home?"

Her mum was having a go at me one day accusing me again of using her even though we hadn't sex at this point when my girlfriend said ""we haven't yet but it's him who doesn't want it! I keep dropping hints!"" Her mums face was a mixture of disgust and contempt.  Fast forward five years and the brother is now 18 and the mum is saying ""he shows no interest in girls or boys, I looked at his phone and he's turned down three different girls offers of sex, I'm worried!""

Similarly, the government can't keep you from saying racist things, but the rest of society can certainly tell you you're racist."
3625,"I've considered killing myself at times.  I'm not above willfully believing bullshit to trick myself into staying here.  At the time I had te good fortune to be surrounded by a bunch of buddhists and hippies who would indulge me in believing in reincarnation.  

What happened is I figured if I did kill myself I would just be reincarnated and I'd have the same shit to work through in that life.  Whatever well of darkness I had in me now, constantly bubbling to the surface and making my mind a twisted knot of horror, would still be with me in the next life, and I'd have to face it then.  

What worse is I would have to start with some random re-roll.  Maybe I'd be a fucking spider or something.  Good fucking luck figuring out happiness as a spider.  

I know it's bullshit.  I knew it then.  But I realized that my beliefs are just figments of my imagination - it doesn't really matter if they're true.  So I absorbed the reincarnation myth and from that point of view there was no escape, not even death would end the suffering.  

The only choice I had to get out was to meditate.  

And meditating hard for a long time helped.  It helped a lot.  At times I figured ""what's the point?  I could meditate my whole life and not be enlightened"".  But then I'd think ""well, then I'll continue working on it next lifetime.""  

That also helped.  Helped me maintain effort on this project that nobody could give me any guarantee would ever succeed.  The general consensus was that it *would* work, given enough time.  But there was no guarantee the time period would be anything reasonable.  

So believing in reincarnation helped there too.  Gave me this infinite time span perspective, content to spend hours at a time on little flutters of sensation in my belly, like scrubbing an aircraft carrier with a toothbrush.  

No, I don't have any reason to believe in reincarnation.  Other than the simulation argument of course.  But it wasn't from any rational evidence based reasoning that I picked it up.  I sort of slid into it because it was easy in those circles, and it sort of reconfigured the game board to make suicide pointless and meditation a guaranteed win.  

Turns out suicide *is* pointless and meditation *is* a guaranteed win.  

I'm starting to shed my mystical beliefs now.  They just seem more silly now than they did before.  My teachers told me this would happen - they say people kind of go through phases in their spiritual practice.  At times you're really rational, then other times your thinking will get really magical.  The world will seem like a big ball of synchronicity crossed with some kind of zany circus.  

Last time I was all rational and scientific was college.  Then I discovered drugs and the multiverse, then zen, then some serious emotional relief (""whew!""), now I'm just kinda working, earning money, making friends, building a life.  

Glad I had some weird shit to hang onto when I was suicidal.  None of the buttoned-down normal shit in society inspired me enough to stay.  But I got to see a burning man once, and I got to meet some great monks, and had some really dark but eye opening trips.  Got to hear about Elon Musk and hear some Bill Burr.  You know, found some good shit, shit worth sticking around for.  

There are some really excellent things.  The way consciousness can feel after you scrub it for years, polish and hone it, practice with it like an instrument, sit and sweat and cry for days while the rest of the retreat listens to you sitting there and says nothing to you, the absolute horror of realizing you haven't taken a full breath in ten years and you *can't*, followed hours or days later by the diaphragm suddenly going ""fleh"" and releasing and feeling your chest fill completely.  Oh god, the way consciousness can feel, even the same consciousness who once felt like nothing but grating steel inside one's head, that felt like black tar full of vomit and teeth clenching so hard they crack, the whipping horror of the fact that every leaf on every twig of every branch of every tree on every planet of existence is nothing but pain, that nobody understands how futile it is but those who choose to see clearly, even that consciousness that felt completely unrepairable and full of bugs, the way that consciousness can feel, the level of how fucking incredible it can get, how sweet and beautiful and exciting and clear - like MDMA and adderall in a feather bed - is worth sticking around for.  

If you leave, you never get to see that."

&gt;You'll instead need to educate them.

You think people aren't trying?  What these groups (climate denyers, creationists, vaccine alarmists, moon landing conspiracy people) have in common is that you don't arrive at these positions by not knowing.  These people are actively ignoring the information in front of them.  They are willfully ignorant.  If we could just inform them of the facts, we would, and we try.  But these are people who think carrying a snowball into congress is proof that global warming can't be happening.  They're not even trying to learn.  You can only educate someone who is willing to be educated.  You can't speak to someone who has put in ear plugs.

I don't have an elitist attitude.  I have identified a problem.  Are you going to debate the legitimacy of anything I've said?  My final statement of ""people are stupid,"" is not my starting point.  I've arrived at that conclusion after looking at the state of the country and politics.

We dated in HS briefly. He moved to TX for three years. He moves back to NJ. For me... He says this. Once he moves to NJ, on the first day of his arrival, he asks me for a place to stay. I barely knew the guy anymore.

He stays a week. I am still living at my moms. He won't leave. We (my entire family) politely ask him. He says it is 'because he is part of our family now'. He sits down for dinner with us even when we ask him not to. He sleeps in my bed when I sleep out (I sleep at my current boyfriend's house every night). He just. Won't. Leave.

I break and tell him if he doesn't leave, I'm calling the cops. By this point in time, my sister (9 years old) has called me three times complaining that he walks around the house naked. My brother tells me that he spends hours in my room smelling my shit. Not literally. You get it.

He agrees to leave, after professing how he wants to ""touch my body"" and how he loves me so. OK, whatever, he's gone at least. Nope.

I come home that night from a friend's house and he is there. Nobody invited him in, no one even knew he was in the house. He is eating food from the fridge and tells me he is part of our family now and you can't kick family out of the house. It's christmas morning, around 5 am, so my family is waking up. He asks where his presents are.

I kick him out again, forcefully. Like, push out the door. Later that evening, I go over to my father's house. My dad was out of town, but keeps his keys in the mailbox for me.

He is in there, sitting on the couch watching TV. Like nothing is wrong. I tell him he broke into my dad's house and that I'm going to call the police, he threatens suicide.

He follows me to TN for a music festival, and after that, I don't hear from him. I don't know where he lives now. Eek.

Other photographers you are only paying for the time they spend there. Not a product. You then buy prints or some form of digital pictures (files, USB, DVD). This is kind of the way wedding photography worked pre digital so some are going to do it because it's just how it's done or how they've always done it. However a benefit is that it may mean you can pay a lower amount just to have them show up and take photos and then figure out buying them later (depending on how they're packages work). The benefit for the photographer is it creates a low barrier for entry for new clients and better ability (hopefully) for sales down the road. "

3875,"I wouldn't be surprised as I personally know and have seen a few who did this. Unfortunately this is an extremely common method that ppl from Vietnam do (I'm sure ppl from other countries do it too) to bypass the government as a quick and easy way to immigrate and become a natural citizen of other countries, especially the US. 

As soon as the person is able to receive their green card after 3 years of ""marriage"" (they have to be a permanent resident for at least 3 years before they can get a green card) they file for divorce and both parties get the best of the situation; one gets their citizenship, and the other gets paid a lump sum of money from the ""ex-spouse"". This usually range from $35,000 to $50,000. 

This is, of course, illegal and the government have been cracking down on these situations more in recent years."

3882,"It was a sticky situation...first off, war was very different at the time.  Killing civilians was sort of ok, as seen w the bombings of London.  When Truman heard of the bomb, he didnt question the ethics, he said ""We have a bomb and were in a war, use it!"" Or something along those lines.  On top of that, a lot of US troops would be lost in a ground invasion, and many enemy Japanese war factories were near civilian areas.

3909,"I kind of did similar. I stopped trying to strain myself as much, I was running like 10 miles a day. Though I still bust my balls every day working and taking on extra work. Might want to stop saying yes to extra work. Though the money is usually too good and I love the work."
3910,"Mind if I ask your age?

I'm 30, and my experience very much mirrors the above posters. All through my education, we were told over and over just how challenging school was, and how special and smart we all were for doing so well. I was always put into honors or AP classes, because I was coming into a public high school after a mainly private early education. The result was spending four years not having to try at all, while being told I was an amazing student.

I got bored of the academics, because I was never challenged or strained, and moved into art, where I could basically do whatever I wanted because the school had labeled me as 'gifted' even though all that really meant was that my parents paid more for my elementary school than my classmates'.

Three years into college, I gave up on art because I sucked at it, and left with a meaningless liberal arts degree, which was enough to land me a simple corporate job where I continue to be highly rewarded for doing simple work anybody could do. 

I've found that people slightly older tend to value my ""work"" more, because they actually had to bust ass to be successful, and people younger tend to value themselves more than me because they were in the generation told that a C- was an accomplishment worth celebrating. It all just goes back to your experience growing up.

I try to motivate myself, but it's hard when the world rewards my D- effort as much as hey reward my A+ effort - why stress myself out when no one notices or cares?"

3913,"Usually talent is hired by the owner. my cousin is an outstanding rising chef. He was hired by restaurant moguls to start a restaurant. The concept, menu, food relationships, management, etc. were all him. The owners simply provided the capital. After a year of success, they fired him and replaced him with the sous chef he trained himself and kept the menu the same.

Also, the worker is at risk of being unemployed if the business goes under, not the same level of risk maybe but definitely not a guaranteed paycheck."

But imagine if people could just walk out of basic training, or any stage of their career like it was Arbys or something. It would be a mess. Not just extra paperwork for ol drill sgt (who is responsible fir these mixed up young people not killing themselves) but a logistical and operational NIGHTMARE. 

Plus ...their is no conscription in the states. You volunteered...and now the big green angry man is yelling at you to stand still or make your bunk and you decide its not for you? Ugh...been out of your army for a few years now and its making me angry thinking about it.

3933,"There's a video where a Chinese (fairly sure Chinese but I may be wrong and really don't want to check) woman gets crushed (by being caught and pulled in at the top of an escalator. It's fairly easy to find. You don't see anything really except her slowly sink into the floor and they censor (maybe you can find an uncensored version but the quality is so poor you wouldn't see much anyway) the final bit when it gets to the upper chest/head. 

Also saw a guy get his head caught in a very fast industrial hydraulic press. Yeah... when a coworker shows up and releases the pressure I expected him to have less of a head but you can tell it's crushed beyond livable and the blood starts pooling up fast after his body collapses on the floor. Also fairly easy to find.

For some reason, large powerful machinery scares me more than anything. I've seen suicides and accidents but they don't really bother me quite like getting ground to death by an escalator. Now I just avoid that stuff because it really wasn't doing me any good. All these links are staying blue."

As soon as they pointed it out, it couldn't be unseen. 

I went on the date anyway, and tried hard (with success) to call him his name instead of George, but he *just had so much of his mannerisms. Oh my god.* Well, we didn't really have any chemistry together so the date wasn't gonna go anywhere. As he was walking me back to the subway, we started talking about Seinfeld.

The lyrics say: *A single gunshot -- but just who shot who?* It is easy to assume that Rico shot Tony. But Rico and Tony had been having a fistfight for a while by then -- long enough for many punches and for multiple chairs to be smashed in two. If Rico were armed and willing to kill, why not do so earlier?

Moreover, Lola's response seems overly dramatic, if Rico killed Tony. Sure, that is tragic; but to go to the same nightclub every single night to drink herself blind, for decades? The song does not mention any animus that Lola has for Rico. There is no suggestion that she is angry. The reason is that she isn't. She isn't driven mad by the (relatively mundane) grief of having lost her lover, she is driven mad by having shot him to death herself.

Lola became afraid for Tony as he fought, pulled a pistol, and tried to help him. Instead, she killed him. She returns every night to the club to relive the night she destroyed two lives."

So about twelve years ago, this cholo looking dude and I become unlikely friends at work. We joked, talked and took breaks together. We were unlikely pals. He's 5'1, neck, chest and arms covered in tats, crooked nose from too many fights. ME? 5'10"", no tattoos, never fought in my life, Geeky/Nerdy, thick Drew Carey glasses.

One day he asked me for my number ""to hang out"". I found it odd. Never had a dude ask me for my number. I lied and said I didn't have a cell phone. He looked me in the eyes, said, if you don't wanna hang out, just say so, but don't lie to me. I gave it to him ... because he was intimidating.

So he invited me to a house party, his homies would be there. I showed up. Totally the outcast. Everyone wearing colored bananas, Nike Cortez, Dickie's, crisp clean wife beaters, dark sunglasses and various jailhouse tats. I feel all eyes on me. El Guero. El Pinching Narco. I thought I was gonna get jumped.

A big fucker approached me. Asked me, ""que barrio?"" Essentially asking me what hood I represent!?!? WTF? The music stopped. Beer bottles find their places. All eyes on me. My heart quickens. I think I'm bout to get fucked up! Then MY HOMEBOY stepped up between me and the big vato, told him I'm a guest, a guest of Chino &amp; Shark.

4002,"This one will forever bug me. So I moved into a new apartment and of course you still get junk mail from people living there. I kept getting dental catalogs from different companies addressed to a Dr. *Russian Sounding Name.* Then we kept getting his bills, bank statements, insurance mail, and even a massive investment portfolio. At first, I would just throw them away, but then then the mail in his name started getting sent in with URGENT or RESPOND PROMPTLY. I just found this to be strange, why didn't this dentist tell his bank and investors his new address? I even tried googling him and he had a practice in my city, but Google listed it as ""perms rely closed."" No trace of the guy on Facebook or any social media. One day I get this MASSIVE box, like I can't even drag it inside hardly. I got curious (yes I know this is illegal) and opened it a few months later. It's a fucking dental X-Ray machine. I looked it up and it's worth anywhere from $2000-$10,000. I still have the machine sitting in my closet, and it's been almost a year, yet no word from Russian dentist guy. At this point I just want to know what happened to him, like obviously this machine cost him a decent amount and he hasn't looked for it."

4004,"I ah... I think it was more sad growing up into a young adult and realizing that my father wouldn't ever take my side to stand up against my rapist. I started telling him about that and ... I didn't even get to the threats/psychological torture/stalking. I think no matter what he did, I was going to be scarred indefinitely. But it sure would of been nice to have my own father holding my hand and wiping my tears through it. A lot of sleepless nights and panic attacks for years after that I dealt with alone."
4005,"I don't know about other girls, but I very easily show emotions and I cry easily too. My BF, on the other hand, is like most of the guys I know, he doesn't show a lot of emotions. The ONE time I've seen him cry was hard, because I wanted nothing more than him being happy again, but he also finally showed emotion, in front of me, and relied on me to help him. He opened up to me and that's what I want in a relationship. It was a strong moment and it made me feel closer to him, especially since he doesn't do it often. It's ok to show emotions when you need to, and it's ok to want comfort when you're going through something hard.
When I cry, I want comfort, and when someone cries, I want to comfort them. So my BF doing that feels like he really trusts me and wants me there to help, and not someone else."

I'm kind of disappointed by how totally, totally unable a lot of the guys here are to just accept that sometimes women are allowed to be dissatisfied with the way that some men behave. I find it really sad that, instead of saying 

&gt; ""Whoa, that happens to you women? Shit, that's awful. What is there that I can do to stop other guys from behaving that way?""

A lot of guys' immediate response is

&gt; ""That doesn't happen! You're lying! And even if it did, it's not all men that do that! Women are always saying this kind of shit but they don't understand why men do things that way, and it's women that make us behave that way anyway, because they do this and that other thing, so stop generalizing about a whole gender and stop just ignoring what I'm saying, just like I'm doing to you!!""

You figure out after a while that, even though you can't imagine a world without the thing that you love, when it goes away? The world carries on. You carry on. And then after a while other wonderful things come into your life, and you're ok.

You're going to be ok."

It was great hearing nothing but the sound of nature. After not going for a few years we decided to go back and spend a weekend there. We were in shock at what we found. A good piece of the land was paved over and converted into a strip mall and parking lot, the sites that were still available were overcrowded,  other people around us were blasting music on speakers and getting drunk, yelling all the time, and complaining that there was no wifi, there was a no camp fire rule, and all the trails had been overgrown and difficult to follow.

4063,"I have been waiting years to tell this story to the world. 

In high school, one of my best friends was a guy who we'll call Mark. He was a bit crazy, always wanting to go on random adventures and just do stupid shit that I never understood. When we turned 18 he convinced me to go to a nightclub in this sketchy nearby city with him to ""celebrate"", and told me the dress code was fancy as you could be, definitely no jeans. We showed up decked out, me in sparkly heels and a short dress, while everyone else was literally wearing jeans. We sat around for an hour sipping soda and feeling awkward before he'd had enough and we could go. In short, it was a terrible but lovable memory that seems to sum up our friendship pretty well.

Well two years prior to the club fiasco,  I was at our other best friend, Natalie's, house. She and Mark had had plans to go out to lunch somewhere and so I chose to tag along with them. Mark was the only one with a car so he picked us up and we headed off. The whole time he was acting weird, very uptight and off, a lot of weird giggling, as if he had some secret that we hadn't been told. We get to the restaurant and get some food and sit down, and this is when he finally cracks.

It turns out motherfucking Mark had been dabbling on Craigslist, bored and looking for free shit or whatever he did in his spare time. He stumbled across the ""companion seeking"" section, and looked into the man seeking man ads. Natalie and I were a bit surprised, but happy that he was choosing us to come out to first. Of course we should have known that wasn't it, because that would have been too normal and Mark didn't do normal.

No, after seeing an ad for man seeking minor, he chose to list an advertisement posing as a 15 year old boy who was interested in a ""Sugar Daddy"". He had posted that he and his girlfriend wanted to look into voyeurism with an older man and that while she wouldn't participate, they were a package deal. He had enlisted our friend Natalie to unknowingly pose as his gf, and when I'd come along he was relived since the man probably wouldn't recognize us. Because yes, he had exchanged emails with someone, complete with the man sending dick pics, and had agreed to meet a 60 year old man. Here, today, at this motherfucking restaurant, to arrange details of sex.

It was a joke, he swore, he just wanted to see if someone showed up. Natalie and I were pissed, but after lots of convincing, and the fact that our food had come, we stuck around to see if the man would show up. And sure enough, less than 10 minutes later, this old man walked in wearing the orange turtleneck and green corduroys he had described in his email to Mark.

He was clearly looking around to see if Mark was there, and more than once his eyes landed on our table. We were so fucking scared the whole time that he would come over and try to proposition us, and when he got a coffee and sat at a table near ours, looking over every few moments, we scarfed down the rest of our food and left.

TL;DR: Crazy best friend posted an ad to attract pedophiles and dragged me and another friend with him to meet the creep in the corduroys.

Bouazizi, already massively in debt with no way to pay it off decides to end his life spectacularly. He sets himself ablaze in front of the local government building. This act is in inspiration to the local people who hail him as a martyr and other activists immolate themselves to protest the government. This local unrest swells into a national movement across Tunisia and suceeds! It's success leads to similar movements across the middle east, but most importantly Libya and Syria who develop into full scale civil wars. The war in Syria becomes the driving point for insurgent groups and mass emigration, ultimately leading to anti-immigration candidates and movements, including Brexit. "

The Sopranos, Six Feet Under, House, etc have some great entries to be sure though.

The apex of this collective apex from the master of tragedy is undoubtedly ""The Body"" which is probably the rawest and focused depictions of death and grief I have seen.

The characters are socially awkward/inept, but not so much so that they can't maintain solid friendships or romantic relationships. More importantly, they're competent in their respective ""nerdy"" fields, with impressive jobs, doing cool things and succeeding. What's the problem? A critically much more respected show like Silicon Valley is far worse in that respect.

4249,"My ex was a serial philanderer who, given the benefit of a doubt, proved himself to be the same cheating dick he always had been. 

Story goes as such:
I woke up to a text from the mother of his child (he knocked some chick up a couple years before we got together and it took two years for him to come to terms with the fact that the kid probably was his and that he ought to have taken responsibility for it) asking if she could meet us at the house we were living in at the time for him to be able to meet his daughter for the first or second time. Now, this chick is messed up on a few levels. From stalking to sending death threats to all his girlfriends, including me. 

Naturally, because this chick was crazy, I told her that if she wanted to meet with him, she could meet him for lunch and organize it on her behalf. I wasn't gonna have any part of it because the house/apartment was in my name and I wasn't comfortable with the whole thing. So, she flipped out. Sent more death threats. I ignored the whole thing, until she told me to ""pick up my clothes off the bathroom floor"". Hmm. 

So my boyfriend at the time was at work when I got this message, and I sent the screenshots to him, demanding an explanation about why she knew I had a pair of pajama pants on my bathroom floor from the night before (she explained the details of the pajama pants perfectly), and he flipped the fuck out. He told me to block her, that she was just trying to get under my skin, etc. And since she was crazy, the first assumption that I jumped to was that she was inside my apartment at some point in the last day or two. She may have lived a few towns over, but that wouldn't have stopped this crazy bitch from trespassing or whatever. Next conclusion was that she was actually here, had moved here without me knowing, and was sleeping with him while I was at work. 

Guess none of it would have mattered, since it turned out that he was sending her lots of photos of his dick. And I knew, but he didn't know that I knew. I mean, come on. An excuse saying that you were ""sending pictures of your weirdly shaped poop to your buddy and accidentally sent it to her instead""? Okay, maybe I'd believe it if I was a child. 

So, shitty ex boyfriend, work on your stories and excuses in the future if you wanna cheat on your women.

4253,"People aren't getting dumber, and they aren't really celebrating being dumb.

What's happening is that the internet creates an echo chamber for every weird point of view you could come up with. Those echo chambers build unreasonable level of confidence in viewpoints and couple it with a ""everybody but us sure is dumb!"" sentiment which assumes their worldview is so bleeding obvious that anyone who can't see it must have some sort of deficiency.

You used to need cults and aggressive religions to find this sort of behavior. Now, it's pretty much everywhere. We have a way to discover all kinds of viewpoints and cast ours against them, to become better informed and more well-rounded. What do we do? 

We sought out the people who thought exactly like we do and locked ourselves in a room with them. We sealed ourselves off from dissent, then we created some easy-to-remember insults to tag anyone else with and off we went. There's TheDonald with their ""cucks"", SRS with ""shitbirds"", KiA/TiA with their ""SJW"" boogiemen and feminazis...it's the same thing as Calvinists and the ""reprobate"" or Muslims and ""infidels"".

Reddit is a great example of them, but it's hardly limited. Political establishments in general do this. MSNBC and Fox news specialize in fostering an unrelenting worldview barricaded in by the idea that subscribing to even the slightest bit of the ""wrong"" side would make you a horrible person. 

Point is, it isn't stupidity. People don't applaud idiots, they still laugh at them. The difference is that we've now decided that anyone who doesn't think EXACTLY like we do is an idiot."

Our IT staff person struggled to make an iPod Shuffle work, holding everything up for 20 minutes, but eventually they married in silence.

Oh, that was also the couple where the groomsmen went into the reception hall, bullied the bartender into opening the bar early, then invited guests down, all before the ceremony.

4265,"Not a wedding planner but the bridesmaid. My sister and fiancée (now husband) were getting married, she had just found out she was around 6 weeks pregnant and obviously didn't want a lot of stress, so naturally being younger sister and bridesmaid I took up the mantle to deal with all last minute disasters. One day prior to this my sister and her husband decided to buy an expensive bouquet of flowers for my mum, his step-mum and his mother for donating money, making wedding trinkets etc. My mother and his step-mum were really grateful for this gesture of thanks and insisted they shouldn't have... The grooms mother however was not so grateful, she threw an absolute fit about how she wanted them presented to her at the reception with a speech so everyone knew how much she had contributed to the wedding (she gave them some money and stayed out of it). I sorted it out and she was still allowed to come and reluctantly accepted the bouquet without her speech and show. 
So, on the day I made all the phone calls and dealt with one mess after another without my sister finding out. I didn't even touch on the fact that one of the bridesmaids was 2 hours late (was also the hairdresser for my sister) I made a hasty exit outside to call her and find out were the fuck she was as the other bridesmaid was doing her make up. I found her outside being chatted up by one of the best men who had come to drop off a wedding gift 
for my sister from her husband to be, he obviously got distracted on the way in. I gave her my best 'get the fuck up the stairs' look and rounded on the best man with an expression that could only be rivalled by hades himself. He left the present (which cheered my sister up) and I left him with strict instructions to call me if anything went wrong NOT the bride. The day went pretty smoothly until the drink started to flow. The grooms mother (I will now refer to her as monsterinlaw) started screaming bloody murder at me because 'horrendously' I had to take 2 seconds out of the day to pee, and my sister needed her dress bussled for the first dance (I was the only one who knew how to do it). I did the deed and then warned the monsterinlaw that she was on thin ice and if she did anything to ruin my sisters day then I would end her. 
I didn't hear anything for a while and started to get merry, dealing with minor disasters from creepy granddads chatting up family friends the age of their granddaughters, to drunken louts falling over the kids. Unbeknownst to me the monsterinlaw had began to seek out each and every member of my family and insult them one by one. I didn't find this out until I bumped into one of the other bridesmaids (a very old family friend) who proceeded to tell me in an irate manner that she'd over heard the monsterinlaw taking shit out on my brother and then rounded on her. 
I was furious. 
I pulled her aside and told her to shut up and leave, her son was lucky to be married to my sister and if she wanted anything to do with them or their future children then she better watch her step. 
-She's a horrible woman and I still can't stand to be in the same room as her today. Its been almost 3 years.

Edit: When the monsterinlaw got married (8th time lucky) my sister and her husband PAID for her ENTIRE honeymoon, they didn't get as much as a thankyou. "

I had absolutely no clue what she was talking about, and told her James Bond gets more info than this before taking on a mission...who's her husband?  She would never tell me... just constant angry texts accusing me of being with her husband. 
I figured her hubby was a drug rep, because I'm a nurse at a MD's office, and that was the ONLY thing that made sense...there were only a handful that had my contact information, this should be easy to figure out...but she wasn't letting up, so I told her to ""keep it classy"", and blocked her number.
However, I could not let this go....within a month, between my super sleuth skills, and another two nurses I work with, we figured out who the husband was.  He WAS a drug rep!  I had known the man for five years...never did he wear a ring, and he ALWAYS said he was single.  
So, the next time he was in the office, I approached him, with the biggest grin you ever did see: 
""HEEEEEEY!!!! I'm glad you're here, I wanted to talk to you.  Your wife contacted me.  Which I found both confusing and interesting, because I've known you all these years and you've always been single, and never had any kids.""
His face went white ""I AM single.  I DON'T have any kids!""
I just rolled my eyes, ""Yes you are.  I KNOW you are.  I've seen the pictures! And, by the way, all these women, in all these offices you call on...we're ALL friends with on another.  WE. ALL. KNOW.""
Again, his get's white face, then apologizes....for he wife he ""doesn't have"" contacting me.
I then walked to the break room, unblocked her number, and told her EVERYTHING I knew about the jerk...all the way down to my friend's best friend (a nurse at another office he called on) he was having an affair with...and how he lied to her about being married too!

4297,"I think a lot of that attitude comes from the fact that it's harder to find a well-paying, stable job that pertains to humanities. Of course, those jobs exist, and in larger numbers, I think, than Redditors believe, and a degree doesn't guarantee a job in that field, but I digress. Furthermore, I think Reddit, and many people in general, like clear-cut lines and dichotomies. Jobs can require both STEM related knowledge and an excellent grasp of language and aesthetics, but many Redditors seem to overlook those jobs or demean them for requiring any kind of artistic skill. For example, someone looking to go into marketing may want to pursue  psychology *and* english along with finance. Similarly, someone dreaming to work at Pixar likely needs to know computer science, would be benefited by knowing how to draw, and could contribute more to the development of a film if they knew how to write. Anecdotal though it may be, I do believe that diversifying knowledge and learning more are almost always better. "

My Grandma had to go into hospital for a short while for her hip replacement, and while she was there she lost a lot of weight. I guess her ring slipped off of her finger when they were moving her back into her apartment. She was super upset about it, the ring was a family heirloom given to her by her own Grandmother (Nanny she called her). 

I went back to the hospital, hoping against hope that someone had picked it up. When I got there no one had turned anything into the lost and found, but I begged a nurse to let me check the room that my Grandma had stayed in. So this nurse let me into the room, and there, on the floor, next to the first bed in the room was the ring! I saw it almost immediately.

4341,"Washington, D.C. --- November 8, 2016 -- In a most stunning turn of events, the third-party Royalist candidate Elizabeth Mountbatten-Windsor has been elected President of the United States with an overwhelming majority. The 90-year old Windsor will be sworn in as president in January, with her 34-year old grandson William as Vice-President.


The other candidates added their words of support:

""I think it's great that Loopy Lizzie is gonna be president, lemme teyya, she's gonna be fantastic. Almost as good as me.""

""Almost as good as *I*. Anyway, well, what can I say? At least we have a woman president now.""

Reactions on both sides are already strong, with American voices suggesting an ever closer union, while the British already seem to be regretting their decision and have started to seek support for ""peaceful secession"" among more the more conservative senators, particularly those in the South. The Scots, due to hold their independence referendum in March, could not be reached for comment.

President-elect Windsor is not the first of her name to rise to the position of head of state: a distant cousin of hers, Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Tsar of Bulgaria during World War II, was Prime Minister of that country between 2001 and 2005."

This being said I can speak for the southern area. We actually spend alot of time speaking about WW2 in 7th-9th grade. Alongside to the so called ""Vergangenheitsbewältigung"" (come to terms with the past) which is basically alot talking about how it happened to avoid it happening again we visited places such as the prison in Landsberg am Lech where Hitler was imprisoned and wrote Mein Kampf but also concentration camps. To be honest this was feeling way more intense than just covering it in a class. Standing in a gas chamber with a guy telling you how people were treated the most brutal ways and the exact steps on how to kill people being in there was probably the most uncomfortable thing I have been experiencing in my life. I think the major events were covered more or less. There was no big talk about the Germans in Africa or war crimes being commited by countries other than Germany which was a bit underwhelming."

I had plenty of friends, but if I didn't run into anyone or plan things myself, and I didn't have a girlfriend, then Friday and Saturday would come and go like a blowing tumbleweed with nothing but a few texts from Mom to show for it.

What I realized is that in the social world there are leaders and there are followers, and obviously most people fit in between, but there are a lot of people out there who are total followers. If you're a follower, you don't get invited unless

a) It would violate the status quo (it would be awkward not to invite you)

b) You provide some value to the group in a social sense

Leaders provide that value because they tend to have social value. They are also outgoing and always know more people to bring along, and chances are they organized or at least suggested the get-together and helped plan the logistics, even if it's just chilling around playing video games.

Point ""b"" is also why you have a lot more ""forever alone"" guys. In most social situations women are valued over men (think free cover at clubs, sausage fest parties, etc...), so they provide inherent value and thus get invited out more often. I know on many occasions I've seen my friends not invite a pretty cool (but follower) guy out to the bars in favor of a girl I can hardly stand just to even the ratio.

Basically, if you want to be invited out more you need to take the initiative, help in organizing, and provide social value in the form of many social connections (which you'll acquire when you start taking the initiative in inviting people). Stop worrying that you're always the one doing the calling. It's always like this."

It sounds like an obvious thing to say now aged 31. But when I was 17 I did think like this. And if someone had said this to me I would have acted differently.

I am sorry to be the baron of bad news, but you seem buttered, so allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies, and are more than just ice king on the cake. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite.

So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality.

I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go.

Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the fax, instead of making a half-harded effort.

I've heard stories of AirBnB going above and beyond in their attempts to resolve bad hosting situations or reservations gone awry. My experience has been very different.

I stayed at an AirBnB in NYC where it turned out that the ""host"" attached to the location on AirBnB doesn't actually own or live at the house, and might not actually exist. 

I'm a female 20-something, and was traveling with another female 20-something, so we booked with a host we were led to believe was also a female 20-something. 

Nah, ""she"" was an enormous, middle-aged dude, who is an avid Trump supporter. The host spent our first evening there telling us all about how he likes the Donald because he's not afraid to admit that ""he hates Mexicans, women, black people, [insert very long list]."" He also spent a lot of time naked in the living room (where we were supposed to sleep.)

We reported the rental to AirBnB because *at the very least* they need to know that the host is using a false identity (kind of a serious safety concern, right?) and also we had kind of a shitty time. I got one reply back that said my ""complaint"" was being escalated, and then nothing for weeks. I followed up a few times, but never got anything but a scripted reply that had nothing to do with the situation I'd reported. 

I am a lot more reticent about AirBnB after that, and I don't recommend them to friends anymore. If I reported a fraudulent host profile and AirBnB did nothing, what's to say my future hosts haven't also been reported for serious infractions, but ignored by AirBnB? 

No thanks."

4657,"I grew up surrounded by hmong culture, it fascinates me. But your post reminded me of a somewhat paranormal experience I had completely forgotten about....

I was about 19 at a friends house, very traditional hmong family, and one of the young children in the family kept screaming at me in hmong language, which I do not know... apparently he said I had demons with me. 

The grandfather comes to talk to me, and has my friend translate. He asks a few questions but the only one I remember is him asking me if I could feel them dragging down my spirit...

Grandpa wouldn't let me leave, he got a hold of his friend/family member, who, lo and behold, was a hmong shaman...

They told me typically they would not intervene in something like this with someone from outside the community, but said the spirits had torn apart my soul (s?) and if I didn't get help I would likely die. Grandpa was insistent, I think in part because I was in their home... 

ANYWAY... it was such a weird, weird, WEIRD experience. The shaman chanted and burned incense around me, tied a bunch of strings around my wrists.... drew symbols in the air. Oh and he killed a chicken! That was interesting....

At first, I was just playing a long because grandpa was so adamant, and they believed so strongly, but it was otherworldly... I am a devout atheist, but in that moment I believed he was among the spirit world, piecing  my soul back together.

Now, I don't know if there were spirits attached to me, but that ritual brought me out of a 6 year deep depression. I was often on the verge of suicide, and no one knew... 

For a time after, it really felt like my soul was whole, and unburdened. That was a completely new feeling to me... It had been a long time since I hadn't felt crippling depression. Unfortunately it only lasted 2 years until I fell into it again, but looking back, even moreso now, I can say that ritual played a huge part in me overcoming depression and is a huge reason I'm still alive today.

If you don't mind me asking, where are you from? I know most hmongs in the US tend to be in Central California, Wisconsin or Minesota, we're possibly neighbors!"

When I was a kid we didn't have a lot of money, so we often shopped at thrift stores. What I loved about it back then was that you could get 10 books for a dollar. So, I would plant myself in front of the book section and make piles of which one I wanted to get and then decided after I'd gone through them all.

One day an older lady saw me sitting with my piles and asked if I liked to read. I told her I did and showed her a few of the books I found that I liked. She smiled and then pulled a dollar out of her purse, handed it to me and said, ""Promise me that you'll keep reading."" I was so happy and immediately stood up and said that I would. She smiled and walked away and I went back to my piles able to pick out an extra 10 books to take home.

EDIT: To elaborate, there are a lot of challenges that LGBTQ people face that straight people don't even have to think about because there is no stigma attached to heterosexuality. Some of the shit I've dealt with in the past 2 weeks because I'm gay:  
1) Wondering whether my executed lease will be rejected by the condo association because they see 2 men are leasing a one bedroom apartment. This is legal in my state.  
2) Worrying that I would be attacked for holding my boyfriend's hand in a new city when the 4 straight couples I was with were all holding hands. Showing any sort of PDA in public requires that you ask yourself a whole slew of questions beforehand regarding threat and safety. Thankfully I've only gotten strange looks, but by and large my partner and I rarely hold hands because of potential threat. It's just not worth the risk usually. You have to stay constantly vigilant of your surroundings, if you're ""acting too gay,"" etc. The vigilance is stressful. You can't always be your authentic self.  
3) Crying over the fact that any of the 49 LGBTQ Orlando victims could have easily been me. That could have been my mom crying on TV. There are hundreds of thousands of people who want me dead because of who I love.  
Add-on: LGBTQ people suffer increased rates of mental illness and psychological distress. Look up Ilan Meyer's ""sexual minority stress"" theory if interested in learning more."

There's an industrial grade food destroying blender living in the sink that means you let food run down the drain, going completely against all the rules your parents set about washing up. 

Everyone puts massive serving plates on the table. and No-one is expected to finish their plates. I got through a steak and as soon as I had finished up my host got up (and very delighted that people liked his steaks) started grilling more. Being British I felt so bad he had gone to the trouble unnecessarily I started eating that as well. Eventually we had to talk about it.

4850,"If you're the defender, you don't need to gain anything in order to win.  

Let's say I have an army, and you have a castle. I decide to attack your castle with my army, so I encircle it and start a siege. Pretty soon though, I realize that my army is running out of food faster than your castle is. So I take my army and I leave.  

You wouldn't call that a draw. You would say that you won, because you successfully defended the castle. You didn't need to gain anything in order to win, you just needed to make sure that I didn't take the castle.  

To extend this analogy to the War of 1812, the British have the castle, which we will call Canada, and the U.S. are the invading army. The only thing Britain had to do to win was defend Canada, and they did that. And then they also burned a few American cities, just because they could."

Teaching is pretty intimate, especially in a one-on-one situation. It's so hot when they're passionate about what they're teaching me.

Also, whenever I study with a girl, I want to challenge her to concentrate while I eat her out. Like she would be into it but annoyed because she's trying to learn something, but then I'd challenge her like, ""Oh yeah?

Trinitarian concepts pre-date Christianity by a fucking long shot and a half, but the specific route it took getting to Christianity in this case go from the Babylonian Trinity in about 2kBC, which influenced Roman and Grecian paganism and proliferated forward to Constantine, who insisted that Jesus was a/the god (directly contrary to scripture) after Paul tried to dibs the Unknown God of Grecian paganism as just another form of Jesus. Mix in some Grecian animus, a political decree from Constantine stating the above, and some retcon coming out of southern France in ~500BC pretending to be ~350BC and somewhere else entirely, and you finally land at Christian Orthodox trinitary, thus far for still less than half the running time of this particular strains life. 

Clovers derivative of Christan trinity? Shit, the pagan triple spiral and triquetra are present in NEOLITHIC Ireland. 4kBC to 2.5kBC. As in, the concept of Celtic and pre-celtic trinitary pre-date even the trinitary that made its way into Christianity, by a *minimum* of 500 years."

You'll see a lot of how the military went rogue and assassinated the peaceful Prime Minister Inukai and how it went to shit from there government-wise, but also a lot about how Japan was suffering from a lack of resources. They don't gloss over the facts though; acknowledgment of the Nanking Massacre is a must, and there's always material about the Japanese subjugation of the Korean and Chinese peoples before and during WWII. There's also just as much emphasis on the horrors of nuclear weaponry, so really not much to go about in terms of bias.

4928,"I'm for Brexit despite the fact it's more popular for young people my age to vote remain. I'd first start by saying both campaigns have been atrocious and I think everyone on both sides mutually understands this which is why it's been so hard for some people to make a decision without seeing a balanced argument.

The reasons I have for voting Brexit are:

1. We don't have full control of our own laws and quite frankly the EU is not democratic. We cannot remove any of these ridiculous 5 presidents they have in the EU making laws which govern us, which is a serious flaw. Part of democracy is being able to hold our officials accountable and remove them from power. Remain does acknowledge this but argues that we should stay in to still have a seat at the negotiating table so to speak, well we only have 13% of the vote and as more countries join the EU we lose influence. Quite frankly the other countries will vote for what benefits them most which for much of the EU that is poorer it is usually not in our best interests.

2. I mentioned more countries joining the EU, and that's an issue. Turkey is on the fast track to joining the EU, and as far as I'm concerned this poses a threat to the UK. Turkey has supposedly got flawed border security and there's been lots of reports of buying ISIS oil etc and in general supporting them, regardless of that fact if you look at /r/worldnews it gets saturated with the shit Erdogan does. Having Turkey join means free movement into the UK which I don't want.

3. Remain says we'll plunge into recession leaving and most financial institutes agree with this. Well no shit, who'd have thought dissolving our EU membership and trade deals would have an impact on our economy? Of course it will but let's be honest people are self interested and the UK is the 5th largest economy currently. So many other countries will want to trade with us because it's beneficial to them. If you look at some of the people who endorse remain/leave you'll see they mostly have business interests either in the EU or outside it which financially motivates their vote. In addition, Europe is a stagnating economy; It has the slowest rate of economic growth over any other continent. I believe in the long term with new trade deals in Asia/South America we'd be better off in the long run but we would have a period of recession first.

4. The NHS is quite the political football at the moment. On the one hand the migrants who come here do the NHS a great service and are the backbone of our healthcare system. I'd be concerned with losing many of them but I would expect we will focus on allowing in skilled migrants to work in the NHS and also encouraging more Brits to enter into healthcare, albeit hard to do with the Jeremy Cunt fiasco. So I have faith we'd be able to populate it with enough workers. By leaving I hope we'd be able to both membership fee money on the NHS and also avoid being forced into TTIP.

5. Immigration needs to be controlled. If we maintain unstable rates of growth it puts too much pressure on public services as well as things we also have issues with at the moment, like housing. Additionally the current free movement is biased against the rest of the world. Any unskilled worker from the EU can come to the UK over say a skilled engineer from Korea or Japan. It's said a lot but we do need a points based immigration system like Australia. A lot of the lefties jump at calling it racist or saying we have a humanitarian duty to take in more people but quite frankly it isn't racist it's common sense, and I agree we should help people as much as we can but if you look at the European immigration crisis the vast majority of people who have come to EU countries are economic migrants who aren't from Syria, they're from northern Africa or elsewhere in the Middle East. I feel we should focus on fixing problems in our country first before helping other people.

I'll leave this for now because It's reaching the point where I'm ranting about problems but these should give an idea of the way I'm thinking. For the most part I avoided using facts/figures because quite frankly they get thrown around all over the place and no one really knows what's going on."

Just bringing up good things about Hillary makes you a 'confirmed shill'.

But there's two things about it that I don't get. One, Hillary Clinton paid for literally zero of them: No money can go from Hillary for America to Correct The Record at all. Yet every comment says 'Hillary paid for'. 

Two, assuming CTR is just trying to muddy the waters and 'troll' online (the first article I saw about CTR on /r/politics was 'paying for trolls to comment on reddit', automatically assuming bad behavior), why would they press release it?

Without a press release nobody would have ever known what they were doing at all. If CTR wanted to engage people secretly, they never would have informed you at all. People act like they found this amazing conspiracy out when they literally told you exactly what they were going to do. 

Then you decided they were actually doing something other than what they said they'd do. Minutes after the press release, dozens of obvious trolls were in /r/politics pretending to be CTR shills and /r/politics and /r/sandersforpresident just ate that shit up hook line and sinker."

4984,"I had a history teacher in high school who repeatedly lost my term paper. We were given the option of writing a term paper or participating in [National History Day](http://nhd.org/). For those who don't know, NHD is basically a contest; you make a project based on the theme (usually something like, ""famous American inventors"" or ""lesser-known Americans who changed history""). For National History Day, you'd have to dress up nicely and bring your project to school so that the judges could come in and...well, judge your project. Oh, and the judging usually takes place either after school or on a Saturday, so you get to give up your free time. 

I didn't feel like slapping together a poster and then giving up my Saturday, so I opted to write a term paper. My teacher wanted updates from everyone about the status about their term paper or NHD project, so he had scheduled these little conferences during class. 

First conference rolls around, I give him an outline of my term paper. We talk about it briefly. He says he'll look over the outline.

Second conference, he tells me that he's worried because he doesn't know what I'm doing my NHD project on. I tell him I'm writing a term paper. He says that he doesn't know anything about it and tells me that I should do a NHD project instead. I give him the rough draft of my term paper and tell him that I'm not doing a NHD project. He takes the rough draft.

Third conference, he tells me that I'm in danger of failing his class because I haven't contributed anything to NHD or my term paper. I tell him that I actually have given him several rough drafts of my paper, which he claims that he never received. I give him my second draft of the term paper. Then I go home and start putting together a poster for NHD, because I know he'll lose my term paper again.

Fourth conference -- lo and behold, this asshat has lost my term paper and is claiming that I've never contributed anything to his class. I show him my poster for NHD. He relaxes immediately and tells me that it's a great poster (it wasn't; it was the worst poster ever).

National History Day rolls around. I drag myself and my shitty poster to school and spend the entire day hanging out in the cafeteria with everyone else who's participating in National History Day. I got a B on the poster."

Way before the Spanish colonized us the natives were believers of spirits in nature. There were good ones and bad ones. Even after colonization and widespread Christianity a lot of us still believe in spirits, monster, etc. Mostly just the bad/scary ones.

The most common paranormal entities are White Lady, Manananggal, and most famous of all, Aswang. White Lady is as the name says. Think Sadako from The Ring except floating. From what I've heard/read if they show their face to you you die from the frightful image right on the spot. Before I concluded it was from Sleep Paralysis my first encounter with one was in first year high school. I was still settling in the new surrounding. Our school was located 2 hours from my home province and was in a very rural farmland. We were the 5th batch to ever enroll in this school. Anyway, basically a White Lady visited me in the middle of the night and she came through the bathroom. She slowly floated towards my bed and I was paralyzed. A more recent story is from my friend who decided to go jogging early in the morning. The city were in can be very foggy and has a more temperate climate compared to the lowlands. He was jogging through this sparsely lit zigzag road. No car, no other joggers. The street lights were of the orange/yellow kind. In the distance he sees a shade of white, just outside the range of a street light. He slows down a bit for a better look. It's in the shape of a person. He noped right out of there.

Manananggal is a creature that at night halves its body with the upper half sprouting wings and looking for pregnant women. They eat the unborn fetus with their long tongue. They are kinda becoming less common though.

Aswangs are shapeshifters. They can be normal looking people to animals to hideous creatures. Heck, these guys are still feared by a lot of people that I hear radio reports of Aswang attacks. They may be similar to Vampires.

We still have a few Shamans, if that's a good translation, locally called Albularyo. In fact when I was a child my mom, without my knowledge hired an Albularyo to rid me of the devil that's possessing me... this was based on the 2 cowlicks on my hair which people from the rural provinces believe where indicators of a devil child.

Another interesting and specific one involves one of the local Shopping Malls. They say that one of the children of the founder is a half man, half lizard. He has a secret lair underneath one of their Mall branches and would secretly view women in changing rooms or bathrooms. If he fancies one, a hole would open beneath them and he would be waiting below to eat them. Kinda stupid but when I heard that as a child it freaked me out.

A less scary lore is if a relative has recently passed, if you ever find a large moth in the room/area you are in it is the deceased relative giving you a final visit. Kinda bittersweet. If you ever dream about one of your teeth falling out you need to tell one of your family members immediately and then bite anything that's made of wood. They say this will prevent the death of a relative. Experienced it once myself and also bit a wooden chair. Also duwendes or dwarves if that's an acceptable translation. These creatures can curse you if you desecrate their homes. Similar to an anthill, so a lot of us dare not disturb anthills. My uncle is rumored to have befriended one. They give you blessings/knowledge in exchange for gifts or offerings. He's an Engineer and also owns his own construction company. One time one of his workers had a severe stomachache. No medicine is easing his pain. My uncle goes a bit in the distance, starts talking to something that isn't there. Comes back tells one of the other workers to burn a piece of paper, gather the ash and put it in a glass of water and let the sick guy drink it. A few minutes later he's fine."

My parents were getting married by their hometown pastor after they had moved about an hour away. They commuted to the pastor about once a week for the pre-marital counseling. Well one night they were driving back in the dark and my mom had dozed off while my dad was driving. One stretch of the highway has rock faces on both sides, and about a 10ft median between N/S bound lanes. My dad sees a white vapory wolf-like creatue about 8-10 ft tall appear out of one side of the cliff, and start crossing the opposite side of the highway, right when it gets about to the center median, my dad realizes if it continues the trajectory it's going to hit the car. So my dad realizes if he slams the break or veers they're going to crash at the speed he's going, so he just braces for impact. Well he just goes right through it, and as they collide he just got cold, like a 20 degree temperature drop, then he looks in his rear-view mirror and sees it continue into the other side of the cliff and disappear. My dad is contemplating waking my mom up, when she wakes up on her own. She looks up at my dad and says ""I just had the strangest dream about being chased by a massive wolf telling me not to marry you, and if I do it will devour me"". My dad immediately got weak at the knees and faint and pulled over, and told my mom what just happened. I don't know about the conversation that followed, but they're still married 30 years later and no wolf attacks yet."

5054,"I think it comes from the history of some states - Texas in particular was a viable and proud country on its own before joining the US, and much of that independent spirit still exists there.  In comparison, most of the midwest and west region was first organized under the United States banner, and people living there never really formed an independent history.  

An easier to understand example might be Hawaii, since the time spent in the US is shorter - I bet many people born there identify strongly as ""Hawaiian"" even before identifying as ""American"".  The same holds true for Puerto Rico, where some of the most delightfully flamboyant pride I've ever seen originates...  and if they achieved statehood I don't think people would suddenly overnight stop considering themselves strongly Puerto Rican.

I think the same diversity holds true in Europe, too.  Many people in central and eastern European countries take deep pride in their EU citizenship - particularly in former soviet bloc countries like Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, etc.  

In contrast, I think many citizens of the UK have a strong British/English/Northern Irish/Welsh/Scottish identity first and foremost, and the desire to preserve that emotional connection is a strong motivator for some people voting Leave."

5088,"I had a religious experience. I had been a very outspoken and well-read atheist, and I had even insisted to some religious friends that a supernatural experience would be insufficient to convert me, since a hallucination is more likely than a genuine, veritable supernatural revelation.

Then I had an experience that left me believing afterwards. I wasn't *convinced* of anything, in the analytic sense of being convinced (argumentation, reasoning, evidence, and so forth), but I *found myself* believing. The arguments that I'd considered airtight before just didn't matter to me much anymore. I'm not going to try to explain the experience in a lot of detail -- partly because it's ineffable but mostly because it's deeply personal -- but during the experience I knew I was in the presence of God, and the effects have been long-lasting (it's been several years)."

5095,"Staying in the World War One vein, I went on a tour of the battlefields about five years ago.

The guide was absolutely on point when he said those who died were real people.  They had their own life stories, their own homes, their own childhoods, their own parents and friends and family,  their own education, their own likes and dislikes, their own aspirations and dreams for the future.

They were senselessly mown down in bloody conflict.  As a result, what wasn't invented or discovered?  What books weren't written?  What music wasn't composed?  What great politicians never had a chance and what changes would they have brought about in society?  What would their never-to-be-born children have gone on to do?  We can never know, and none of it will ever happen.  Indeed, one of the headstones I saw in one of the cemeteries bore the epitaph ""Here lies a mother's dreams"" (or words to that effect).

As Stalin said, ""A single death is a tragedy.  A million deaths is a statistic""."
5096,"That's a fantastic point...but here is my opinion on that matter.

When you volunteer for the Military, you swear an Oath. You are in no doubt at the seriousness of this oath and this sacred commitment you are making. You're not just pledging allegiance...this is a solemn vow and you should take it very seriously. 

The next one is this...can you imagine if it were as easy as dropping a class?? Soooo many people joining just for the laugh. For the ""Badass"" profile picture holding an m4 pointed at the camera. For the Uniform. For the PTSD cred. Just to leave after a week or when they didnt like the push ups 

Also...Basic Training is about re wiring you from a slackjawed civilian into (theoretically) a professional soldier. There will be times you will want to quit. But individuals wont succeed at war. Units do and you have to learn your life isnt yours anymore...it's your battlebuddys  and his yours etc. The Army can only succeed if it has these soldiers in its ranks. If it is optional into how much effort you can put in...everything would fall apart. It would be untenable.

Try listening to the lyrics.

The song is being sung to a young gay man, who seems to have been kicked out of his family after being outed, and who has moved to NYC with nothing: no money, no job, no prospects, and is in despair.

The singer is an older gay man, who's telling him that it's not hopeless, there are people who will help, and he can get back on his feet; the YMCA has some of those people, and is a cheap place to eat and sleep.

Remember, this was 1978, when being gay was nowhere as acceptable as it is now, nearly 40 years later.

I told him I'd only blow him once we were near my apartment. I didn't wanna blow him then have him leave me stranded by the side of the road.

The question was intended to be multiple choice, but I treated it as true/false.  Unless point A was directly north or directly south of point B, I answered ""No"" - neither ""North"" nor ""South"" explains this layout accurately. If they lined up in that direction, I answered ""Yes."" I didn't analyze the questions, this was simply the most natural interpretation for me at the time.  

When the teacher handed back our graded tests, she was so confused by these answers that she read them aloud to the class, and we all laughed.  Then I got the test back and I was like, ""Oh shit, that was me.""

NEO: I've kept quiet for as long as I could, but I feel a certain need to speak up at this point. The human body is the most inefficient source of energy you could possibly imagine. The efficiency of a power plant at converting thermal energy into electricity decreases as you run the turbines at lower temperatures. If you had any sort of food humans could eat, it would be more efficient to burn it in a furnace than feed it to humans. And now you're telling me that their food is the bodies of the dead, fed to the living? Haven't you ever heard of the laws of thermodynamics?

You will have to make compromises and you will have to turn your back on your friends. But you will be a member of the club and you will get promoted and you will get good assignments.” Then Boyd raised his other hand and pointed another direction. “Or you can go that way and you can do something — something for your country and for your Air Force and for yourself. If you decide you want to do something, you may not get promoted and you may not get the good assignments and you certainly will not be a favorite of your superiors. But you won’t have to compromise yourself. You will be true to your friends and to yourself. And your work might make a difference. To be somebody or to do something. In life there is often a roll call. That’s when you will have to make a decision. To be or to do? Which way will you go?”*

5290,"Not too exciting unfortunately. I was what one might call a high achiever in high school. I took my studies seriously and after enduring quite a bit of bullying I became pretty well known for being blunt and for my hilarious Facebook statuses (relevant). My boyfriend at the time I only started dating because I felt pressured to. He was the bad boy stoner who never showed at school and I was the student with high ambitions who wore a lot of pink. I broke up with him after 2 months at the bus stop thinking our short-lived high school relationship wasn't that serious. Came home to about 10 missed calls from him. He got drunk and sent me a bunch of texts like ""if you actually give a shit about me you'll answer your calls."" I answered the next one and it was just him spouting abuse at me for a little over an hour. I eventually hung up on him and he continued typing at me over Facebook. 
After he realised that wouldn't get him anywhere he said he didn't think he could live without me and that he might kill himself if I ended things. He was suffering from depression at the time so I suppose it was believable. I told him I can recognise emotional manipulation and I don't exist to be his emotional punching bag. Our relationship was pretty much him telling me about his problems and refusing to listen to mine. He swore at me some more and when he was done decided to end with ""and by the way, your Facebook statuses aren't that funny.""

It takes 10 seconds of googling to find multiple examples of institutionalized inequality in America. This isn't some sort of controversial issue, this isn't even up for debate. It's just obvious fact. The only way you can claim it *isn't* fact is if you willfully ignore things that make you uncomfortable. 

Though I'm learning a lot of white America, and especially conservative America, likes to pretend its colorblind. The alternative means acknowledging that a lot of the things they believe are motivated more by irrational contempt for brown people than by anything reasonable. Nobody wants to be the ""bad guy"". 

I think most people know racism is wrong. But your typical asshole usually doesn't know he's an asshole. If anything is the problem with a lot of these people it's a lack of self awareness. And honestly I think a lot of America is afraid of being ""aware"".

The existence of racism in our society is and always was a giant slap in the face to our national myth. You can't continue to believe that capitalism is a meritocracy, that our government is just, that our society values freedom and democracy, if you look at how we treat minorities. The kind of shit people of color go through in America drags every one of America's skeletons out of the closet. 

And skeletons are spooky. 

So it's easier for a lot of people to just pretend they aren't there and blame everything on minorities. "

I had told her countless times to stop moving my shit around but she didn't stop. After tearing up the apartment one morning to locate the flash drive I needed for my presentation and being an hour late I hit my breaking point.
Called into work the next day, waited until she left and rearranged everything of hers. Perfume, makeup, jewelry and hell I even switched around her underwear and tshirt drawers.
Sat down and played video games waiting for her return. She came back from work, walked through the door into the bathroom and then the drawer opening started. She went into the bedroom and I could hear more drawers being opened with an audible, ""What the fuck?""
She comes out and says:
Her: Did you move around all my stuff?
Me: No. I simply placed it all in what I thought were more appropriate places like you do with my things. Why having trouble finding things? It sucks not being able to find an item and having to depend on someone to tell you right?

Was probably the best and weirdest movie I've seen in the theatre. Tried to re-watch the movie on tv and good lord it was bad.

5377,"I was a cashier at Walmart for a year. I'll give you all the ones I can think of.

* One of the strangest looking customers I encountered was a man who liked to dress in women's clothing. He was a big burly guy with a full bushy beard and very hairy legs but he seemed to prefer wearing stuff that was way too tight or short. His favourite outfit was a dress with a basketball underneath to make himself look pregnant.

* Everyone's least favourite customer was a woman we called ""the cat lady"". She was a really nice person but she stunk so badly of cat shit that it would make your eyes water. One time she returned some merchandise and it had to be damaged out because it smelled too bad to return to the floor. Later on someone told me that she was an animal hoarder living in a house on the verge of being condemned. 

* I once had to tell two customers not to sword fight with salamis.

* Someone accidentally broke a jar of spaghetti sauce near the front of the store. I put up the wet floor cones and called for store standards to clean it up. The idiot customers continued to walk through it and wheel their carts through it like it wasn't there. 

* A couple had a fight at my till while I was ringing them through. They were buying a bunch of cd's and were arguing about who was going to pay for them. The husband thought the wife should pay because they were for her. The wife thought he should pay because he was responsible for leaving their car door unlocked, which resulted in all of her cd's being stolen and needing replacement.

* A very frail elderly man on an electric cart threatened me with a hammer. 

* A little kid couldn't find the bathroom so he peed in one of the fitting rooms.

* Once while I was busy restocking the gum near the tills a man came up to me and tried to stuff a crumpled receipt down my shirt. It all happened to so fast that I didn't really realize what had happened until he was already walking away with a huge smirk on his face. I went to my manager about it but since he was already gone nothing was done about it.

* I scanned a pair of pants for a man and they came up at $20. He insisted that he had found them on a $10 rack so therefore they should be $10. I called for a price check and was told that I was right so I told him he could either pay the $20 or not buy them. He stood there and refused to move from the line until I called a manager. The manager gave him the pants at $10 just to get rid of him. I still feel like punching him whenever I think of the smug look on his face.

* Numerous customers threatened me with violence for pushing the store credit card, which I was forced to do by management. Our store manager did not give a rat's ass about this so long as we reached our goal for the day. "

5389,"I wonder if shadow people are connected to certain people, because I had a gay coworker and after he left, I saw a shadow person leave out of the reflection in my computer monitor (always worked with the lights off in my office, back when CRT monitors were a thing)

The thing is, most people see them when the lights are OFF. The two times I saw it the lights were ON. And let me tell you, seeing a shadow person with the lights ON is FAR more fucked up than the lights off.

But yeah, came into work early the day after coworker quit, saw shadow person in hallway in monitor reflection, didn't hear the door open and close, but I did hear the door chime that was motion activated. Never saw him again.

The first time I saw it was the most fucked up thing I've ever seen in my life though.

The building was some offices attached to a giant warehouse. Had the front door locked so customers couldn't come in and the door chime went off. We had a LOUD door so hearing the chime and no door means it's something inside. It's an industrial park so homeless people are entirely a possibility. I grabbed my gun and looked out onto the sales floor. Nothing.

So I made my way, sweeping the offices, still nothing. Open the warehouse door and I saw it standing on the far end. I aimed my gun and said, ""hey, I don't want to shoot you but you gotta leave now. People are gonna get here soon."" It just stood there. The warehouse was roughly 40 yards long and the lights in the warehouse were still off.

I flipped the light switch and there was no person, there was just black. Just a sharp black outline. And these were POWERFUL lights. No definition to the face, just an outline standing near the lawn mowers.

I said ""what. The fuuuuuuuck"" and ran out of there. We had two alarm codes. One gave you 30 seconds before arming, the other was a ""Enter this code and the alarm arms as soon as the door closes.""

I entered the immediate one and ran for my car.

As I was driving out of the parking lot, the alarm went off. I went straight to the gas station.

Owner called me, said the police were there and wanted to talk to me. I go there and they said, ""we reported the warehouse zone 2 alarm went off? Is everything alright?"" And I just told them I thought I saw a homeless person in there. They checked the place, didn't find anything. I told them I was going to wait for my coworkers outside because I didn't feel safe.

Honestly, I almost don't want to post this story because I'm home alone and I don't want it to come back. I'm seriously almost in tears. I get sleep paralysis every once in a while and it is nothing compared to seeing that thing. It was just dark nothingness. No face, no chin, nothing. It shouldn't exist. Light makes shadows go away. And how the fuck did it set off a motion detector?! BOTH TIMES. It wasn't right. It made no noise."

I showed my husband his photo and he said, "" that's the guy! ""

Sometimes I have gut feelings for simple things like if I should or shouldn't say something. 

Not sure if this counts as gut but my husband had a job that he was on the road a lot and if he drove far I would join as I love long drives,  he had to go quite far but I decided not to go with cause my son wouldn't have been able to be strapped in as he was going in a truck,  so I stayed home,  when he got to the place,  he left and the client told him to take the scenic route but he just followed the GPS and he got into an accident,  he was driving slower than usual though,  it was raining and there was a diesel spill so he slid. Was a horrible accident but he was unharmed besides whiplash.

One day, Hubs comes home and tells me that one of the cashiers has been hitting on him fairly frequently. Doesn't bother me - I trust him. However, that day he decided to directly address the issue with her. ""Sorry. I'm flattered, but I'm married.""
She responded with ""I know. I've seen you with your wife. I don't date single men. You two seem like you might be interested."" LOL

My story took place the summer after my freshmen year of college when I came back ready and eager to reacquaint myself with some of the ladies I knew back in high school. I came up with a solid game plan of how to get some action... A pint of whiskey and a paid for movie experience at the local AMC... Needless to say we left the movie and went to where I had parked the car... in the back of the theater parking lot. Music was on, vibes were being put out... But then.. A car pulled up next to us, two parking spots away. The guy who parked next to us did not get out of his car, but instead stared at me, intently without breaking eye contact. He looked pissed off, but I knew I hadn't done anything so I tried to ignore him. A minute later, he got out of his car, still looking at us and went to his trunk. At this point I still wasn't thinking too much into this, but I watched him as he walked over. Still looking at me, the man pulled out a black handgun and held it loosely at his side, still staring at me. Without thinking or looking behind me I put the car into gear and gassed it as fast as I could. I to this day have zero idea what the hell that guy had in mind, but I didn't stay long enough to find out. "

It doesn't carry more weight, but that doesn't mean it's meaningless. My boyfriend loves how I look and gets upset whenever I mention losing weight because he thinks I look fine. That's great, and he's a wonderful man, but a lot of men aren't. And I don't want to have to put up with shitty comments, rude looks, and laughing from men because of the way I look (which hasn't happened since probably middle school, but those memories don't fade quite as well as some do). Men, and sometimes women, can be underhandedly cruel about the way someone looks. I don't want to be the subject of that cruelty, so while I appreciate my boyfriend's appreciation of my body and looks, he is not the only one who will be looking and making comments. I'd rather hear positive comments that some of the shit I see online from men.

5479,"Kind of a role reversal for me. At our wedding the church had their own ""wedding planners"" that were supposed to help with the ceremony. When meeting with them before the wedding I informed them that we would need a ramp in the church or to perform the ring ceremony off the alter as my best man was to be my brother, who would have had to be in a wheel chair due to his battle with leukemia. Their reaction, ""Oh, well can't you have someone else do it for you instead of him.""

My wife-to-be at the time saved their lives by changing the subject very fast and asking me to go get something from the car. So much for the Catholic spirit. By the end of the wedding the entire wedding party was referring to these two ladies as the ""wedding Nazis""."
5480,"The rules. The only reason why things work is because people followed the rules. Driving in the U.S. is a pleasant experience because people stop at red lights.

I'm not just talking about driving rules, but rules about everything else. You can't take someone from Mexico, who is taught to bribe the police and that police work the cartel, and convince them to respect the police. They won't do it. So, you have a group of people who respect the law and do everything to obey it, then you have a group of people who have absolutely ZERO regard for the law.

5537,"Growing up in rural Appalachia, you see some pretty strange things, but when I was 12, I saw something that takes the cake.  Where I grew up, there are a lot of winding one-lane roads that follow rivers and streams.  One evening, my Dad and I drove a couple of miles from my house to park on the side of the road and take a path to the river to fish.  The area where my house is surrounded by a wildlife preserve, so the edges of the community are just wilderness.  We got the gear out of the back of the vehicle and set off walking.  Dad went a little ahead of me, in case of snakes or other people and I hung back a little.  I heard Dad yell to tell me to stop and stay put exactly where I am at.  Naturally, I asked what was the matter.  He told me that I didn't want to see it.  Of course, when you're 12 and you're told there's something you don't need to see, you really really want to see it.  I walked a little further and came to a clearing with a very large oak tree that was obviously quite old.  In the tree were what appeared to be at least two dozen partially rotted corpses of small animals.  We could discern that the fur looked like raccoons.  Dad and I quickly got the hell out of there and sped to the nearest ranger station where park rangers lived.  We hurriedly told them what we'd seen and where it was.  The ranger got into the Jeep with us and we went back.  The ranger was obviously as upset and disturbed as much as we were because there seemed to be no logical explanation.  The raccoons were hung by the neck and there did not appear to be any other signs that point to why or for what purpose.  Of course, the word ""cult"" was thrown around but the area is not known for that in the slightest bit.  It still gives me chills to think about it to this day, but there was no logical reason or explanation as to why they were there or even who put them there.  "

When I was little, I loved my dad's father. I was named after him. Whenever I was fussy, Gramps knew how to quiet me. I would only fall asleep in his arms. He lived very far from us. 

It was Easter Sunday 1994, a few months before my second birthday. I was watching The Fox and the Hound and playing on the floor. Suddenly, my eyes grow wide and I begin to scream and cry. I'm on the floor just crying louder then I have ever cried before. Apparently I kept repeating ""Gra Gra"" which is what little me would call Gramps. My parents try to comfort me but Nothing they did worked. 

15 minutes later, my father gets a call. I'm still crying at this point. My uncle was on the phone. He tells my father that Gramps had just had a fatal heart attack. He died at the exact moment I began to cry. My parents said that it was to the exact minute. To this day they can't explain how I knew my Grandfather had died."

But if you compare and contrast the German and Japanese government responses over the decades (Germany: active nazi hunting assistance, extraditions, returning of stolen goods, museums, education programs, monuments, etc), and the ramifications of such (the level of knowledge among their respective peoples), it is no contest. Just look at the comments in this thread alone.  Roughly speaking, the Germans know exactly what happened, the Japanese seem to have a murky idea that they may have made a boo boo.  That's better than outright denial, but there's obviously a lot more room for growth. "

I started helping these two tibetan girls who chose me specifically. They just arrived to Australia as their parents were murdered in there country and came here to live with there grandma. The grandma didn't speak a lick of english and neither did they. They were quiet, shy and struggling to learn which is understandable due to the stress and trauma they had gone through as well as the fact they're now in a random country whose language they don't understand. I made a point to not only help with there homework but also buy them nice things here and there as I knew the grandma couldn't afford it. Just things like trendy trainers, brand items etc so they dressed like everyone. I'm a young professional female in my mid/late 20s and they were teens so I'd just get them whatever was trending at there school so other kids at school thought they were cool. It wouldn't even cost that much as they would really take care of whatever I got them so it would last for ages. A few years later they topped their class, have lots of friends and are very out going. They have now both been accepted into medical school. When they graduated high school they bought me a present and gave it to me with there grandma. The grandma hugged me and was crying saying I'm what gave those girls life and confidence and she would be eternally greatful. I didn't realise giving up just 1 hour out of my week and buying kids a few things here and there would literally change the course of their lives so dramatically.

5630,"Storage methods are the most important aspect of keeping your house clean (if things don't belong somewhere, they tend to just sit around). 

The hardest part of cleaning a house is finding where to start. Typically, I start with the bathroom used most frequently. This is most likely the worst room to do and will have the most components moved to another room (moving cups to the kitchen, trash to the bin outside, etc).  From there, I tend to loop through all the rooms and do the floors of the rooms last.  It's easiest to pick a day and time where you will most likely have free time to do (I plan for three to four hours).  The key is to do it every week or so, as skipping will make the mess accumulate.  I like to listen to audiobooks while cleaning, it helps not make it so dull. "

5633,"The underage girl texting scam. 

You hit it off with a girl on a dating site. She's hot, young (20-23 normally), and very flirty. Things move to text messages and eventually thing move to sexting. She will ask that you send her some nudes. If you refuse often times she will send some naked photos and demand you do the same. 

A day later you'll get a text or call from her ""father"" ranting about how she is underage (usually 16-17) and how he's pissed and will go to the police unless you pay up $1k-$5k for her ""therapy"".  He will often have your name and details and he will demand you send the money Western Union right now. Sometimes the call will be from ""The FBI"" but the story is the same: pay or be arrested. 

There never was a girl, there is no father, and there is no risk of police involvement. Your name and information is usually found via social media or a reverse telephone lookup service. It is all a scam and entirely too many people fall for it or are unwilling to ask around because they think they've been sexting with a minor. "

Basically a HUGE amount of leavers are basically voting to leave under the pretext we can get a better deal with the EU, that because we're so **Great**^^tm and such a 'powerhouse' they'll do anything to get us back and so we can renegotiate.

Obviously if that happens every other country is going to have the same thoughts and it'll spell the end for the Union.


That *isn't* going to happen. Not only has virtually every single leader of the other primary powers and the Union as a whole said ""No. If you vote to leave, you leave.

&gt; 

Well I looked it up.

&gt;Giacomo Matteotti (Italian pronunciation: [ˈdʒaːkomo matteˈɔtti]; 22 May 1885 – 10 June 1924) was an Italian socialist politician. On 30 May 1924, he openly spoke in the Italian Parliament alleging the Fascists committed fraud in the recently held elections, and denounced the violence they used to gain votes. Eleven days later he was kidnapped and killed by Fascists.

I nearly smacked him I was so outraged. I nearly dumped him on the spot when he refused to believe that 10% of our ENTIRE population (not just able bodied men) were enlisted in the war, with a huge proportion of them being killed or wounded at the order of HIS country.

Later, when I met his whole family I joked about how he was so dumb that he didn't even know that Australians fought in the war for the English. Nobody, not even his Elderly Grandfather who fought in WWII had any idea that huge percentages of our tiny, growing population were lost fighting for a country that used us as pawns in both wars.

It's not just Australia either. There is apparently no mention in the British curriculum of the masses of men who fought and died on the orders of the Brits from Australia, New Zealand, Burma and Papua New Guinea just to name a few from my neck of the woods. Both my Mother and Fathers families were torn apart by fighting in wwII (my Dads father was permanently disabled, my Mums father had PTSD from watching his brother die. My Grandmothers 2 brothers were prisoners of war at the behest of the Japanese from whom they eventually escaped and lived in the Burmese jungle for 4 years whilst their families assumed they were dead). We may be a small country, but we suffered at the orders of the British and they won't even have the courtesy to tell schoolkids that we fought and died for THEIR cause.

Those conversations need to be had in a separate place, when and where people feel safe expressing their opinions without worrying about repercussions: the workplace is not it.

The main reason for this is that you also have the issue of power dynamics. If a boss/supervisor/superior expresses an opinion on any of the those topics, then anyone who expresses a contrary opinion has (in some cases justifiable) reason to worry that the boss will see them in less favorable light, resulting in subconscious discrimination against them. Similarly, expressing an opinion that may be later heard by a boss/supervisor/superior may have the same results"

It will probably help a lot that Home Depot is probably one of those places that more people will go to because they *want* to be there, rather than because they *need* to be there.

My first job was working behind the electronics counter at Target. It was legitimately *wonderful*. I had other responsibilities, sure, but for the most part, I got to talk about video games all day to people. This was right around the time the original Wii came out and was making waves to the mainstream, so there were a lot of parents/families/""non-gamers"" who were coming in, curious of what video gaming was about.

It helped that, at Target, you didn't have sales goals or any form of commission, so you never felt pressured to make sales and could give honest, genuine advice. I dunno if it's still like this today, but at the time it was a massive departure from my stint at GameStop (which was still fun, but not quite as fulfilling because of the constant pushing of subs and addons and such).

I ended up making a lot of friends too—repeat customers who knew me by name and trusted my taste in games, parents who were overjoyed to finally be able to share in the activity with their kids, even older ladies and gentlemen who would reminisce with me about how far technology has come in such a short time.

I honestly felt invincible, like an ambassador to the world for video gaming, like it was my duty to be the public face about this art form I was incredibly passionate about. And I loved almost every second of my job.

Looking back, I know I was just a kid who was taking his job way too seriously. But damn it all, I just can't deny that it was one of the happiest times of my life.

Now I'm a video editor. Aside from one documentary whose subject matter I was extremely passionate about, the job is draining, the hours are long, and I'm sitting in a dark isolated room for 99% of them, committing myself to an artsy craft that not only requires absurd amounts of intuitive and technical skill, but whose entire purpose is to manipulate reality so invisibly that your entire presence goes almost completely unnoticed if done correctly.

I make more money, by far. But sometimes I wonder if I'm happier."

5791,"The real story behind my dad's life. My dad's always been a storyteller and while I wouldn't say that he's a compulsive liar, he does seem to have the need to invent stories to make himself seem more interesting to others, including his family. I have two half brothers from my dad's first marriage and the stories their mother told them about my dad don't at all match up with the stories he told me about him growing up. I was always told that he'd  fought in the vietnam war. My brothers were told that he'd never actually gone ""in country"" because of his family. But we once had one of his old army buddies over and he'd talked about some of my dad's stories without my dad ever bringing them up. 

Also, I've seen my dad do things that line up with the stories he used to tell me. He told me that he'd been what his officer called a ""sneaky pete"" which meant he'd slip into a village and capture people alive and bring them out without waking anyone. While that sounds suspect, I watched him sneak up on a freaking rattlesnake. A snake, which senses vibrations in the ground. My dad snuck up on it, snatched it up by the back of it's head, whipped it around over his head and snapped it like a whip, popping it's head off. I saw this happen. And not as a child, as a teenager. He took the snake home with us, skinned it and grilled it. We ate the snake for dinner and he made a hatband for his cowboy hat out of it's skin.

The weirdest thing is that the stories my brother's found the most unbelievable from when we recently reconnected with him are the ones I know for a fact are true. Like that he's had lunch with the President. I know it happened, I was there, saw the President and we got a Christmas card from the Whitehouse that year. The man is a bit of an enigma, to say the least.

TL:DR My dad lies to make himself seem more interesting, but still led an incredibly interesting life, making discerning truth from fiction nearly impossible."

By the time I woke her up, the man had come around the house, was banging on the door then made his way around to all the living room windows, tapping solidly. She called the police and we had to wait until they arrived to arrest him, all the while he circled around the house over and over, just tapping on the windows. 

When the cops showed up, he ran away from the house, into the woods (we literally lived in the middle of nowhere).

5906,"I had a Public Defender represent me for 2 b.s. charges that resulted from a minor traffic incident which the D.A. first reccomended 3 years probation if I pled guilty! The charges were resisting arrest of a police officer, and assault on a guy I barely bumped with my car, a bully type of a guy who got very angry and very mouthy at the scene, and lied to the 911 operator (lots of calling me an ""asshole"", (tapes got played to the judges out of my earshot), and at the scene I stood up for myself against the bully other driver and a second cop who showed up to the scene like he was Starsky or Hutch. 

  My lawyer was a nice, very smart appearing blonde woman, from a Balkan state originally, so English was not a first language for her, though she was capable in English, a red flag went up for me, my case was important to me. Still, she was a smart hard working public defender, and a new mom of a daughter, dealing with a large caseload in Central Islip NY. Usually P.D.'s make plea deals with lower penaltys. I told her no deals on my case. Every month for 10 months I went to court until the first trial, resisting arrest.

  I wasn't pleased with my P.D., overworked as she was,(she was used to pleading out her cases, though this turned out to be a big one for her in the end). At one point I told her that I'll represent myself, and she can be there for the legal paperwork, then I told her what would really help my case. She looked at me and asked, ""What?"" I told her point blank, ""If my lawyer believed me."", and I left our meeting at that.

 The next meeting I had printed out a page of my version of what actually happened at the scene which she read.  Then she understood it from my point of view, it was very important to have my lawyer believe in me.

  In my first trial, the police officer lied on the stand saying I held onto a fence (irl a flimsy vinyl picket fence) as he was trying to arrest me. I looked at my lawyer then and made a face to her that said, ""No way did that happen"". That bolstered her confidence, and she got the officer to admit that he did not witness an assault by me on the other driver, so there was no reason to arrest me (like I told the officer at the time), it being the other driver's word against mine. The legal people huddled and said something about, ""dismissed in two weeks"".

  My second trial on ""allegedly"" assaulting the driver, after he testified, I plainly stated what happened. The D.A. knew it was a shaky case and assigned it to a beginner who asked me why I didn't run away from the driver I bumped when he walked quickly up on me from 15 feet away while we were waiting for the police. I evenly replied, ""I could have tripped backwards over the curb."", (which was true), but irl there was no way I was going to run from such an (obvious to me) bully. When the 'not guilty' verdict came I couldn't resist a small 'fisted arm shake' when the judge said I won. That's when I told the judge, an even handed but stern man, how after the first case was disposed of, that the running joke ""Ms. P.D."" and I had was, ""She's my Matlock"", which the 2 judges laughed aloud at (which was pretty cool for me to see, considering that at the start I was facing 3 years probation!). 

My P.D. and I were both on our different kind of 'highs' in the elevator ride down to the lobby. Me happy for it all being done with, her because for the first time ever she had successfully fought and won 2 cases from the D.A. that normally she'd have had to plea out from, s.o.s. (I gotta say that when I saw her struggling to position the 4 foot high dais from which to question the police officer from showed me that she really gave a damn about my case!)

 She was on cloud nine when I left her with the words, ""Thank you for believing me, Counselor.""

5919,"K, well he was a 2nd LT in second of command of a self propelled amphib artillery unit. Before that he was actually an artillery instructor on Parris Island until 1944, then he transfered into the fighting forces and started fighting during the cleanup of Guadalcanal. This was just artillery stuff, he never saw an enemy. 

When his unit was landing on Pelelieu, (this next part it patched together from historical records and his story) his unit's self propelled guns got bogged down in some coral or some other water/beach obstruction so they couldnt move forward. 

But because they were goddamn Marines, they just took up rifles and formed an infantry unit and pressed forward while swimming or on foot. 

The Japanese were evil and clever, because even though this tiny island had been bombarded by a fucking battleship and two aircraft carriers for six days, the Japanese were simply playing dead and were actually hiding in the intricate cave system.  They still had 90 percent combat readines IIRC even after the massive amount of firepower rained down upon them, while US leaders thought they were all dying in holes. 

So the leading elements of Marines march towards the center of the island under heavier resistance than expected, and all of a sudden my GG'a unit is pinned down by all sides in an ambush in this kind of canyon hollow thing. 

My GG was one of the two men who retained freedom of movement, him and a sergeant.  Because it was an officer and an NCO of an artillery hnit, they hadnt set out with full combat kit for people who werent grunts, so they had, between the two of them, two handguns and two bags full of grenades. 

The two of them clear out 20-50 caves (GG didnt remember, and nobody knows) with just a handgun and grenades, and at the end of it GG gets shot through the lung.  The sergeant died as far as we know, and we still don't know who he was. But the unit wasnt pinned down any more, and it advanced. 

So GG is laying on the cave system in a pool of blood for about a day (nobody knows) and he wakes up to find a Japanese soldier trying to bayonet him to death.  He lost his pistol at this point, so he reaches into his boot and pulls out his father's WWI pistol that had been captured from a German officer and shoots the guy dead. 

He did not remember anything past that point.  All we know is he showed up on the beach four days later with multiple life threatening injuries, a WWI handgun with no ammo, a Japanese rifle with no ammo, and knife wounds and bayonet wounds. 

Triage put him in the ""he is going to die and we don't have enough medical supplies to waste on him"" bunks, where he layed for another couple of days until they went back and checked and he was still alive. 

Then he lived to age 92 with one working lung. 

The Battle of Pelelieu is IMO the bloodiest battle that the US has ever fought. One company started off with 187 men, and ended up with 18 alive at the end of the battle, and all of them were non combat level injured.  *They still completed their objective and were considered the victors of the battle they fought.* Also,  during the fighting in the caves, both sides ran out of ammunition and were literally knife, sword, and bayonet fighting in caves for about a week.

I think the reason Daphne's character changes so much in the last few seasons is because, prior to that, she wasn't really part of the main core of characters. I viewed her as a supporting cast member - like Bulldog. She had a separate life, separate boyfriends, separate previous roommates, etc. Once her and Niles got together we got to see more of who Daphne Moon was in a relationship. We never got to see that side of her as much before, even with Donny."

He sends his assistant out to find a Radio Shack, but the reception is going to begin in minutes and the house isn't allowing this to run late as they have another engagement booked later on. Ultimately, the planner and a groomsman got a mike from the house and connected it to the room's PA speaker, and then held the mike up next to a boom box as they played the music for the bridal party's intro and the couple's first dance.

I've dated straight men and women, bi-men and bi-women, gay men, transwomen, and unsuccessfully dated a lesbian once (not just a cheap joke, but an embarrassing story). They were all super-different people, some had similarities, others didn't. 

Being possessive, who pays for dates, and generally worrying about the differences between genders is a result of culture, not biology. Biology is undiscerning. Everyone has a puberty story about fucking a food product or a futon with a hole in it, or whatever. How does that fit into god's plan? Adam and Steve? Adam and microwaved cantaloupe with a hole in it?

Most people's personalities have nothing to do with gender. Just saying. The microwaved cantaloupe is not a woman and doesn't feel like a vagina, but it still makes people cum. 

I was raised Catholic and fought my attraction to all genders for a very long time. If you are straight, I would suggest that you jerk it to some gay porn. What's the harm in finding out? If you like it, keep going. Shake off any taboo, see if it's something that you're genuinely into."

And I thought ""Well, we don't have to worry about that, because we live on the 32nd floor!""

But NOPE. Super terrible for many more reasons. Its literally equivalent of amputating a person's fingers to the first joint. And worse than doing that for a human, because we don't suffer the same kind of constant emotional stress from missing the tips of our fingers as cats do from missing their main mechanism of protect and attack. It causes so many problems, and you'll generally just get a really nasty, bitey cat.

And I've heard so many people try to argue why they *needed* to declaw their cat, and they are all(with one possible exception) bullshit. Don't want your furniture clawed up? Don't get a fucking cat. Have a disease that make healing difficult or something else where you really can't be scratched? Don't get a cat. You have a small baby that you don't want to be scratched. Don't get a cat. The caveat for the last two being that if you already own the cat when you develop the disease or get pregnant, then I get that finding a better solution is a struggle and could be not possible(though I'd also say that a declawed cat isn't necessarily a great solution to the problem anyway, because the biting still puts people at risk...)

So my buddy and I decided we'd simply snatch like 10 of those booklets and essentially get all three ($240 total) games for like $5. We do it, ringing each other up and overriding the coupon warning code. Everything is peachy. Somehow noone notices.

But wait, there's more! I had a massive guilt trip about it, and I semi-enjoyed my job, so I decided to return them, thinking I knew the logic of the system so it would just give me my $5 back because that's what it usually did. No. I got $240 cash back. I was blown away. I just remember the lady at the counter being so confused when I tried not to take the money.

Later, I told my immediate manager thinking if I get ahead of it I won't get fired. He advised me to hold onto the money in case it came up, and be prepared to return it. I kept $240 in an envelope in my car for 2 years after that. Never heard a thing."

He had me talk to someone on the phone. I don't think he followed protocol exactly right, I'm sure he wasn't *supposed* to tell me it was covered under warranty, but he spoke to someone on the phone, who also spoke to me, then he said ""So yeah this is covered, they'll send you a replacement box thing for you to mail it in.""

If he had said anything like ""I can't guarantee this is covered,"" or more importantly if Verizon had told me it wasn't covered before charging me and just sent it back, I would have never done it. As I said, if I'm paying $300 I'd rather just buy a new phone, or better yet just deal with the no bluetooth until my upgrade.

But here's the best part-- when I first called to complain, they initially said over the phone ""Oh, you talked to a verizon rep who confirmed it? Yeah that's our bad"" and reversed the fee. Then, without telling us, a higher-up un-reversed the fee which is actually how our service got shut off due to non-payment-- it had retroactively been reinstated and rang in as unpaid and overdue. And when we called to ask about *that* they gave us several different excuses until they finally settled on it being out of warranty because of scratches on the screen."

6139,"I believe that the EU does a lot for us, more than we really think about, and it's mostly stuff we don't think about. I made a long comment elsewhere in this thread which details the personal reasons for why I want to stay in the EU which I shall once again copy and past here: 

'The EU does a ridiculous amount of stuff that we take for granted on a day to day basis without really realising.

For example, when I travel within the EU I don't need to show my passport at every border, I don't need to get my passport stamped at an airport. I can go through immigration in less than a few minutes.

When I'm abroad I don't have to pay ridiculous roaming fees on top of foreign network fees (in fact prices are more in line with standard mobile phone charges in the UK).

Whenever I buy or sell anything in the EU I don't have to pay custom fees, nor do my customers have to pay import fees either. I can easily see prices going up. Brexit people keep harping on about how countries such as Germany sell a large number of cars to the UK, so why would Germany increase all the tariffs on cars sold to the UK. That may be true, but how many people buy a new car all the time? How many people actually own German cars? We keep getting told 'facts' and 'figures' for things which don't really matter. We never get told how our day to day purchases will be affected, and that's what's important, and one has to ask why we aren't told that information.

I am also moving to France next year and as a member of the EU I am to be treated exactly the same as any other citizen of France when it comes to jobs, healthcare, housing etc

I'm deliberately listing personal things which affect me on a day to day basis. Thing is, most people don't really realise how much the EU does for them. All we hear about in the media is immigration and the economy. I live in London and my borough has the highest levels of immigration in the country, so if anyone should be complaining about immigration it should be me, and yeah it does suck and there is a lot of crappy things, but overall, I'd rather that than leave.

On a more general level, the Brexit people keep saying how we will be better off outside of the EU. Whatever way you cut it, you can't argue that. We have NO real idea what would happen once we leave. Politicians and the media keep arguing that loads of countries will give us what we want in terms of economic treaties, well I say that just our arrogance talking, as no country has said anything. Another one of the big reasons for leaving the EU is immigration, we have waves of people coming from Eastern Europe and with the terrorism threat we are also experiencing a massive influx of refugees and other economic migrants. Yeah it is a massive issue, but leaving the EU won't stop all the illegal immigrants arriving.

I remember listening to a debate and someone asked what country we would mimic in terms of doing deals with the EU, they asked if we would be like Norway, Canada and some other countries I can't remember, the reply was 'We'll be like Great Britain', which of course got a massive round of cheers and applause from the predominately bexit audience, but what does that really mean? No one really knows, not even the brexiters.

The UK actually imports most of its goods, our economy is mostly based on financial services. That in itself speaks volumes, we need the EU and the rest of the world to sustain ourselves with our day to day lives. London, the heart of the financial sectors will suffer.'


These are all little things that affect me, and I'm sure there are many different things that affect others. I'm sure if we were to leave, all these little things we take for granted and don't really think about would come to the fore if we left. 

My boyfriend works for a small boutique invesments company that mainly deals with European countries (His boss is in at least three different European countries each week doing deals), and he is able to enjoy the benefits of the ease of working with other European companies due to less beauocracy. Sure if we left the EU, most of these deals would still take place, but there would be a lot more form filling. It's the little things that make our days easier..."

They  would not push a dangerous drug onto the market if they are aware of significant side effects. 

Unfortunately, antidepressants  aren't very effective except for a subpopulation of those who take them. I've always believed some of the suicides attributed to the drugs are by those who fail to experience any relief and abandoned all remaining hope, or the drugs begin to work and they get the motivation to act on their suicidal impulses.

You can think of it kind of like a theory of revolutions which explores the factors that go into significant economic changes in history, e.g. The transition from Feudalism to Capitalism. 

From that, it also makes the prediction that Capitalism has its own set of internal inconsistencies which will produce conditions for a transition to another economic system, which Marx predicts to be Socialism, where industry is organised democratically.

In Das Kapital, Marx explores the systematic issues in Capitalism and how they lead to conditions that are seen as exploitative to workers.

Karl Marx is considered one of the three founding fathers of Sociology, along with Émile Durkheim and Max Weber. Whether or not you agree with Socialism, Marxism and especially historical materialism are especially useful tools for analysis of economic and historical events and systems."

Trust isn't automatic, especially when you've been hurt in the past. It's a choice. You will feel scared, and jealous, and have powerful urges to do/say controlling things, but you ride those feelings out and don't act on them.

The more you suppress your irrational response and let her live normally, the more she proves herself worthy of your trust, and the less strongly you get those feelings next time. Over time, it gets easier and easier.

Yes, there's a risk of being hurt. But that's actually part of any healthy relationship. You care, so you've given her the power to hurt you, and you have to choose to trust her when she says she won't."

Australia has not at any point and likely will not 'get rid of guns'. We banned semi automatic weapons and made people who wanted guns prove they had a legitimate reason and obtain a license with strict conditions. We have more guns now then before they were 'banned' plus our police and some security personnel carry hand guns, unlike the UK and NZ.  

Edit: Refer [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_Australia#Firearms_categories) for further info, I was attempting to explain from memory that Australia had no ban on all guns and never attempted to 'get rid of them'. The wiki link gives info to different guns and their restrictions. "

*Almost* perfect! 


The driver side door hinge sagged, squeaked and I eventually took it in to get replaced. That's fine, just a fluke! Worth the cost of the door hinge for all this strange I'm getting, driving my **1999 Ford Mustang**!


Right after that, the power windows refused to work for some *un-American* reason. The mechanic told me it was due to the door being sagged for so long, but **FUCK HIM!** What do mechanics know? They definitely broke it when they replaced the hinge on my **1999 Ford Mustang**! It probably broke due to all that weight on the driver side. Due to all that testicular mass on the driver and all. *If^you^know^what^I^mean!* The driver did drive a **1999 Ford Mustang** after all....


The AC didn't condition air all that great. Well it didn't really do anything but blow hot air in my confident, happy face, but it was OK. It was OK, because I drove a **1999 Ford Mustang** and I just rolled down the windows and bared the heat stroke like a man that owned a **1999 Ford Mustang!**. 

**Correction:** A man with big balls that owned a **1999 Ford Mustang!**

Eventually the master cylinder cracked, so I drove my **1999 Ford Mustang** a measly few miles home on just the emergency brake! Like driving a wild horse through the plains of Detroit, I felt like a badass cowboy that rode his **1999 Ford Mustang!** through the right lane with blinkers on all the way to non life threatening danger! 

WITH BIG BALLS!

Another day I was driving to work and my electronics began to crumble under the manliness of my **1999 Ford Mustang!** The chump on the side of the road who gave me a jump told me it was my alternator, but I knew it was

&gt;TOO MUCH BALLS ON MY **1999 FORD MUSTANG!!!**

Then the radiator hose popped off, but I was only a couple of miles from home in the dead of winter, so it was quiet alright. I was quiet alright in my **1999 FORD MUSTANG!!**

And then the transmission blew out and I said, **FUCK IT!** Sold it off to a junk yard and bought a Toyota. I bought a Toyota Avalon to replace my **1999 Ford Mustang!!**

It did have really comfortable seats and sounded great. It also taught me how to handle myself in emergency situations and what to look out for when buying a used car. It also taught me how to love a woman. As long as that woman was an oil needy, money dependent, 3000+ pound metal bitch."

6229,"A couple of breakdowns did the trick for me.

I did exceedingly well in school, and reasonably well in university too. I always think there are several routes to doing well in school. You can be genuinely interested and engaged with the work, and want to do well just for the sake of learning. You can be naturally smart and pick things up easily. Or you can be like me: a monkey of moderate intelligence with parents who let you know that even a hint of failure, or anything short of perfection will be akin to spitting in their faces and mortally wounding any chance I have at future happiness.

It was quite a lot of pressure, but I seemed to live up to their expectations academically. Unfortunately though, if you get beaten with the same stick enough times, one day you will realise that you are now doing the beating yourself. You don't need pushy parents around telling you how anything short of perfection is failure. You will tell yourself that every single day.

The upshot of this is that success counts for nothing, because it is the bare minimum you demand from yourself, whilst even a minor failure is cause for infinite despair and self-loathing. You will judge yourself in a way which would be unseemly and brutal if you applied it to anyone else.

I made it around eight years into my career before I had my first meltdown, followed by another more serious one a couple of years later, because I hadn't actually learned any lessons from my first one. Thankfully I now have a career which suits my capabilities, and a boos and a wife who both give me regular positive feedback.

I will always feel like a traitor to my earlier efforts, because I have not reached that elusive, unknowable undefined ""ultimate success"" and I never will.

edit: was going to change 'boos' to 'boss' but I like it like that.

6323,"In one relationship I was in.. well.. the sex started out.. terribly, if I'm completely honest. He was lasting less than a minute, regardless of it being a quick-y, him getting off beforehand, etc.

I really liked the guy, and never said anything to make him feel bad about it, even though he'd get upset over it. (We were both 20). I knew he was just embarrassed. 

Anyway after about a month-2 months of quite unfulfilling sex, I whispered to him, when he was about to come, well, not to, basically. I said if he felt like he was going to, he should pull out, and we'd kiss instead. And then we'd go back at it.. and then he'd stop, etc. 

Pretty much over night he got the 'hang' of things, and together we figured out what worked for us. (Before me he has only slept it one girl once, so he wasn't very experienced. I told him if there was ever anything he wanted to experiment with, I'd be up for it, and we'd try it out - which we did).

He went from being the worst person I've ever slept with, to the best person I've ever been with. 

So I guessed he changed my sexual outlook in that just because you might not first have great sexual chemistry, it is very possible to work around it with time, and turn it into something awesome. I think we all expect everyone to just know what we like, what buttons work for us, etc, and sometimes you just need to step back, and do something yourself to improve the situation.

You gotta link those songs or else we'll never get Nier the recognition it deserves. 

[Song of the Ancients \(Devola\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1CjxQXXA7o)  
[Song of the Ancients \(Fate\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5xZbJDZZo4)  

If you're wondering what language the songs are sung in, the answer is none. They are sung in a made up language. 

&gt; Evans wrote songs in versions of Scottish Gaelic, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, English and Japanese, and wrote ""Song of the Ancients"" in an entirely fictional language. She wrote that song by listening to songs in as many languages as possible and jumbling them up together. For the other languages, she tried to imagine what they would sound like after 1000 years of drifting.

And to show how much respect was given to the soundtrack:

&gt;The music for the game was generally composed entirely separate from the development of the game. Often, elements of the game were modified to match the music, rather than the other way around.

If you're insistent on an English translation, [here's a cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htv6B-K_jOc):

don't think about what you're doing. pretend you're on a brand new planet and you have no idea what's on it and you'd really love to know. go slowly, with intention. don't be afraid of applying a good amount of pressure, though it doesn't always need to be pressured too much.

6385,"My grandmother. She is such an asshole. She adopted my mother from an orphanage when my mom was 5 and never let her forget it. When my mom turned 18, my grandmother made my mother get her own health insurance because now that she was 18, she should no longer be sponging off her family...like she has been for the past 13 years.

My mom lived with her parents until she married my dad. The day after their wedding my grandparents called my mom at 8 am and demanded that she come and move her stuff out of their house immediately and return their house key.

We used to live in Chicago and my grandparents moved 8 hours north into Wisconsin (into their summer home) right after I was born. When I was 13 my parents wanted to move out of the city and we looked at homes in Wisconsin and Michigan, eventually settling upon Michigan. My grandfather died a few years later and my grandma told everyone that my mom killed him...She said that if we moved close to them we'd be around to help out and then he wouldn't have died. Which translates into my mom killing him.

They demanded that my mom learn how to type because then she could be a secretary and meet a good man. She ended up being a VP at a tech company in the 90s and travelling for work a lot. My grandmother told people that she was cheating on my dad because she was going on business trips a lot and that if secretaries go on business trips, that means they're having affairs with their bosses. My grandma still thinks my mom was a secretary.

My mom is Native American and my grandparent's whole family is Polish. After my mom was adopted, but when she was still a little kid, they would have big family get togethers and all of the kids would tell my mom that she looked weird and and all of the adults would laugh. My mom would sneak off and cry and then get screamed at for being a brat.

My mom got breast cancer a few years ago and my grandmother told my mom it was her fault and that she must have done something to deserve it.

Again, 1mil total may not seem like all that much to live off of, but if your spending prior was only 25k/year, then you are only withdrawing about 2.5% of your nest egg every year - most conservative assumptions assume that you can draw off of a 3% withdraw rate pretty much indefinitely.

My coworker, who we will call E, was driving an Toyota Hilux, with the mine's logos on the truck, from a nearby town to the mine. She accidentally made a wrong turn and ended up at a dead end. At the dead end, two elderly farmers were sitting in chairs, holding shotguns. As she approached, they both stood up from their chairs and pumped their shotguns.

She threw the truck in reverse to get the hell out of there, but between her panic and having just recently learned to drive stick shift, she killed the truck. E said her life flashed before her eyes, and that once she killed the truck, she was certain she was dead.

6509,"Same for me, I was going to post what's below, then realized you're basically the same story. I just don't think grades are an indicator of success or people's ability to self motivate/learn/adapt.

""To counter that, barely applied myself in high school, failed a grade (laziness and boredom, made it up later after school at local CC, and graduated on time) and would consider myself very successful at what I do, at least compared to what people expected of me and what some of my students who people had high expectations for are doing now (Facebook sadly is a great place to compare yourself to the success of others). I remember frustrating teachers because I would do well or okay on tests, despite sleeping during class or studying, but they'd still barely pass me because homework assignments weren't completed, etc. I usually absorbed just enough information to get by, the only thing that truly stumped me was foreign languages, which there really isn't any other way to learn other than repetition.

Basically, when I learned on my own in something I took interest, I did well, and found something I enjoyed that I kind of excel at that makes money. I also kind of figured out in school that most of what is taught isn't practical or well, sitting at a desk for hours just absorbing and repeating information doesn't actually teach you how to do anything."""

Which women have to do a lot of anyway.

It's great if two people can be honest enough to say ""I'm just looking for sex"" or ""I want a committed relationship, but people aren't honest and it takes time to figure out who is and isn't being truthful.

Also what some people call ""games"" can also be as simple as she likes you but really is busy, so you can't really write off people entirely just because a relationship doesn't go the way you want it to. Adapt or move on. Both are okay."

She has been pursuing a music career for over 2 years. Has a part-time desk job to appease her family but spends all the she earns on herself (She earns around $200 a week). I paid for 85% of the relationships shared expenses.


Her expectations of me financially looking after her had been hidden until I ran into money trouble. Status quo suffered and I couldn't spend much on her. Things quickly deteriorated after this. I tried to reason with her saying if she came to my side more we can still afford to go out like we do but she wasn't having any of it. She equated my financial struggle to a lack of love or affection for her. Saying things like ""If you really loved me you would want to do these things for me and would find a way to get the money.""

6548,"If we were to instate the draft, the war would likely be to the point that we are losing, big time.

If our standing military requires more, there are the Ready Reserves. That's what people think of when they consider the ""two weekends a month and two weeks per year"" group.

If that's not enough, there are the national guards and state guards.

Then there are the IRR, or the Inactive Ready Reserve. These are all the veterans who have served and are still on the recall books for a specified amount of time following the end of their contacts. Usually around 8 years of IRR time for each person, served concurrently with their active time. Serve 4 years active, you gave 4 years of IRR. Serve 9 years active, you've fulfilled your IRR obligations. Fun fact-a member can actually retire from the IRR.

By the time we burn through all these levels of reserves, we'll have gone through a population that is easily four times the size of our standing military. If we have to fall back on untrained civilian draftees, then the hypothetical war is already lost at that point.

A draft is pulled by lots, not by demographic. When a draftee's lot number is pulled, they'd be assigned their duties based on ability and given deferment based on need or qualifications. Not gender.

Edit: forgot to add that draftees were historically assigned noncombat roles, if I remember correctly, which freed up more seasoned veterans to serve on the lines.

Women may now serve on the lines. The argument that they would not be in as much danger is not true, provided the women in question can pass the qualifications required for infantry assignments."

6578,"I worked in a bakery for a while. We didn't offer deliveries, so any orders were on the customer to get safely to their destination. We had a wedding order for 22 dozen cupcakes that came to pick up in a Prius that was already loaded up with other wedding stuff. We loaded in the cupcakes as well as we could, told the driver to wish the happy couple good luck, and sent them on their way.

About an hour later, we get a SCREAMING phone call from the bride's mother, telling us that all of her daughter's precious cupcakes were defective and squished and TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE to serve. Her daughter apparently worked for a local news channel, and she threatened that her daughter would do a special report on our bakery and how we are a sham. Because we were a ""customer is always right"" store (which is another story), our manager apologizes profusely, and offers to fix things for her. We pulled another 22 dozen cupcakes from our daily walk-in sales inventory, and then she drove them out to the wedding site herself and set them up properly. She didn't see the mother, but met the bride briefly, who she said seemed strangely calm for someone who was allegedly devastated by the chaos that we had supposedly created.

Little did the bride's mother know that our owner's brother (and the VP of operations for the company) was a former employee fairly high up at the same news channel the daughter worked for. After hearing the story, he called the station to complain about the daughter's abuse of power. Turns out, she was just an intern, and so the idea of her even being able to do a major story was laughable. 

Several days later, the bride and her new groom (after returning from their honeymoon) show up at our store to apologize profusely for her mother's behavior. Turns out the bride didn't even know about the cupcake snafu until she was pulled into her boss' office to ""discuss her behavior"". Apparently, we had just pulled the pin on her tightly-wound mom's grenade on that day, and she had decided to go rogue. They were super kind and complimentary of our bakery, and bought a bunch of stuff from us to compensate for her mom's behavior.

When I left that job, the couple were still some of our best regulars. We even did the cake for their first anniversary. We never heard from the mother again."

Childfree's version of this vice mainly involves stories of people (moms and dads) behaving reprehensibly (or letting their kids do just that, and doing nothing to stop it or even apologizing for it) and then maybe adding a nauseating display of self-entitlement, as if the world revolves around them, cannot possibly be wronged by them, and in fact owes them a favor just because they gave in to societal/familial pressure and reproduced. 

That's mainly the reason I go there, though; it's not all there is to it. It's a great resource for people who don't want kids and face that same pressure - where they can go to vent, get advice, consolation, commiseration - and be with like minded people. "

I used to babysit for a German couple who would go running.  I'd babysit 2-4 times a week for an hour or so in the evenings, and generally they'd go for a date once and go running the other times.


One time afterwards, while the wife was getting dressed and the husband was sitting on the sofa taking off his socks etc., I said that I was quite jealous of how much he enjoyed running because I'd tried before and just never gotten into it.


He said 'I hate running.  But my wife loves it, and I love spending time with my wife.'"

We were up high on the side of this small wooded mountain overlooking a valley, we didn't see anyone else up there, but on the second day we heard of group of dogs barking down below us, a couple hundred yards away at least, and they wouldn't stop. We thought they were hunting dogs, but we never heard any people, and the dogs never seemed to move. It was the same 3-4 dogs barking in the same place for hours. 

At first we just thought it was strange, but whatever....As night drew the barking got closer, and more rabid, like the dogs were getting angry. We were armed (my cousin is a gun lover), but it started to get slightly unnerving. We were sitting around the campfire when my oldest cousin stood up and says, ""I think we should leave, I don't have a good feeling about staying here another night."" We all agreed and packed up camp pretty quickly and put out our fire before hoping in the truck and leaving. I remember putting the last few things in the back of the truck and hearing those dogs getting closer and closer.

Wear sunscreen.
If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it.
The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience... 
I will dispense this advice now.

Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth; oh nevermind; you will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded.
But trust me, in 20 years you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked... 
You're not as fat as you Imagine.

Don't worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum.
The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind.
The kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle Tuesday.

Do one thing everyday that scares you.

Sing.

Don't be reckless with other people's hearts, don't put up with people who are reckless with yours.

Floss.

Don't waste your time on jealousy; 
Sometimes you're ahead, 
Sometimes You're behind.
The race is long, and in the end, it's only with yourself.

Remember the compliments you receive, forget the insults; 
If you Succeed in doing this, tell me how.

Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements.

Stretch.

Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your
Life.
The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives, some of the most interesting 40 year olds I know still don't.

Get plenty of calcium.

Be kind to your knees, you'll miss them when they're gone.

Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't, maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't, maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary.
Whatever you do, don't Congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself either.
Your choices are half chance, so are everybody else's.
Enjoy your body, Use it every way you can... Don't be afraid of it, or what other people Think of it, 
It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own... 

Dance... even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room.

Read the directions, even if you don't follow them.

Do NOT read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly.

Brother and sister together we'll make it through
Someday your spirit will take you and guide you there
I know you've been hurting, but I've been waiting to be there
For you.
And I'll be there, just tell me now, whenever I can.
Everybody's free.

Get to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good.

Be nice to your siblings; 
They are the best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.

Understand that friends come and go, but for the precious few you should hold on.
Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle because the older you get, the more you need the people you knew when you were young.

Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard; 
Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft.

Travel.

Accept certain inalienable truths, prices will rise, politicians will Philander, you too will get old, and when you do you'll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.

Respect your elders.

Don't expect anyone else to support you.
Maybe you have a trust fund, Maybe you have a wealthy spouse; but you never know when either one might run out.

Don't mess too much with your hair, or by the time you're 40, it will look 85.

Be careful whose advice you buy, but, be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth.

But trust me on the sunscreen...

If you're both beyond miserable then yes, breaking up is probably the best option. But if you're just daydreaming about single life or pining for an old flame or something, it sounds like the problem is more with you internally.. And most of the time that feeling isn't going to change whether or not you leave. Seen it happen over and over, unhappy friends project their unhappiness on their partner and leave only to realize they were wrong.

6784,"&gt; Your WHOLE future is fucked up because you left a political union?

It's much more than that. With all of a sudden, the UK will not be able to participate in the EU market anymore without an additional handycap. Up until now, a UK-based company could access the EU market freely and without restrictions. This freely accessible market has been greatly reduced to the UK only which means that company will have a lot less potential customers, meaning a lot less revenue and eventually likely run out of business.

And, no, the EU will most certainly not just let the UK take part in the free market at no cost. You have already gotten a light taste of what's coming towards you with the Pound dropping over 10% over night and it will continue with the Scots holding their own referendum to leave the UK and with potentially Northern Ireland follow suit.

It's not just leaving a political union, it's the UK throwing fourty years of economic and political development over board. All because of some dumb resentiments against workers from Eastern Europe.

So to just point to one and say ""that's it"" will usually only serve to make them hyper sensitive about something that may or may not be the only thing that killed it for you. In general, if it's just one thing, people will make exceptions. It's when it becomes a multitude that you have to stop and say ""you know this isn't it"". Another person may come along and see the exact same thing, but the ""other factors"" that bothered you don't bother him. And in his case that exact same girl with the exact same weight will pass the multitude test and be just fine."

We had a guy recycle into our Basic Training company about three weeks from the end. He was all sorts of bitter at the time, because he had actually finished BCT his first time through. During their final graduation formation run, he tripped over something in the road, landed wrong, and broke his elbow. They did a surgery to put pins in, and sent him home for 30 days, for convalescent leave. He comes back, and they put him in the rehab company for a while, before recycling him. 


He just could not handle it. By this point, he had (with a 30 day break) been at Fort Leonard Wood for probably close to six months. In 2000/2001, we didn't get calls home, no phones, no off time, just constantly getting messed with. He decided to go AWOL. The barracks had a foot-wide ledge under the windows, so around midnight, he slipped out the second story window, planning to hang from the ledge and drop to the ground. He fell straight onto the drill pad, and knocked himself unconscious. The Drill Sergeants found him there at 4am when they came in to work. 


The shitty part was, he was a 35P. If he had just gutted it through, he would have been heading to beautiful Monterey, CA for up to a year and a half. He never made it; that's where I went.


Then there was the girl who went AWOL in the first week. She got away clean, they never caught her. She came waltzing back about a month later, just walked up in civvies and banged on the door at midnight. When asked where the hell she had been, she casually said, ""Oh, I had to go check on my kids."" "

6825,"He probably felt guilty because he was profiting from the girls, and his attempt at making money caused damage to his neighbor's property. But his neighbors were right to go after the girls for the money and not him."
6826,"I was one of the few combat MOS recruits (trust me, it is relevant) in my Basic company at Ft. Knox (where the tankers and other armor units used to train before they all moved to Benning) and we had one kid who made it in somehow with a 28 on the ASVAB. This being 2008, when there was a HUGE push for more bodies, he was allowed  in and was a light wheel mechanic. Well, things being what they were, the Drills decided to put all the combat MOS guys in the same squad. Most, if not all of us, were 13-F and were all headed to Ft. Sill after Basic Graduation and we were all super fucking hooah.  Because we were 18 and stupid. Most of us were even in pretty good shape for new recruits, so the Drills left us alone for the most part, outside of the usual reindeer games and other assorted bullshit. 

Then the drills, in their wisdom, assigned this fuck to our squad. This guy was maybe 5'9'', 170 very round pounds. Couldn't run, couldn't push, couldn't ruck, couldn't stand at attention, couldn't break down his weapon properly to clean...the list went on and on. So the drills would smoke us instead of him to hopefully encourage him to get better. Fuckers. To the surprise of no one, he continued to suck at anything resembling military skills. And we continued getting smoked. Talk of a blanket party (ala Full Metal Jacket) was soon brought up, but was quashed by one of the older guys in the squad. So things continued into from red phase to blue phase and we went to qualify with our old ass  M-16s. (Cav scouts got the newer M-4s at the time)

Guy literally couldn't qualify. Not even at a basic level. I think he went up to line time and time again, the Drills magically finding extra magazines to slip him. Still, nothing. Scores in the low teens over and over again. So, at this point, the guy is sobbing. He wasn't bright to begin with and this had overwhelmed him utterly. So, shit you not, the DS took his M-16 and qualified for him, hitting the bare minimum of targets just to get him off the range. When we arrived back at the barracks, we were smoked more, for his failures. We were pushing in full battle rattle as he practiced trigger squeeze for hours. 

We tried, oh how we tried. I have never worked harder to help another human being before or since. I was tired of getting smoked. I was tired of watching this little fucker screw up everything, but there was nothing we could do. Each day became more like the last, the drills smoking us for an hour, attempting to try and get the guy into some sense of military bearing. 

Finally, after 8 weeks of smoke sessions, we prepared for the final FTX. The guy hadn't shaped up at all and the drills were tired of fucking with him and us. He was left in our squad, but we finally had peace (of a sort). Much like the Drills, we began to ignore the little bastard as well and I think this was what might have broken him. The guy snapped, a weird sort of way. He stopped caring. He stopped trying. He went up to the Doc and said he was having mental issues. The Doc promptly took his weapon and his boot strings. The Drills once again noticed him and, being fucked up human beings, began tormenting him again. Now, this wasn't right, obviously, but I believe they were of the thought that he was faking. Turns out, the fucker was faking crazy. 

Everyone knows the little elbow shaped flashlights the military issues. They are really cool little things, that come with a variety of issues. This was to be his new ""weapon"". When we left on our final FTX, he was forced to carry it as an M-16. Not only that, but on the ruck out to the site, he was placed squarely in the middle of the road with a Drill right next to him. We left in the dark, to avoid the heat of a Kentucky day, all of our flashlights equipped with the red lenses. His, on the other hand, had a blue lens that made it easy to differentiate him from us, no matter where he was in the formation. 

At one point during that miserable ruck, he began treating it like it was a light saber, complete with noises. The drills basically ignored him until he decided to make a break for it. He took off for the tree line (slowly) and was screaming bloody murder the whole time. Our small hispanic drill simply said ""Oh no you don't hero"" and booked it right after him. It was too dark for us to really see what happened, but that Drill had a split lip afterwards and the idiot had a very bloody nose, no doubt caused by being tackle in the trees. 

After that, they bundled him into a Humvee and drove him on the the bivouac point. But his fun times weren't over yet. Showing resourcefulness that no one had ever seen before from him, he slipped out and stole an M-16 from another company that was sharing the site with us. Of course, no one noticed till the morning, when all hell was raised. He had stolen the M-16 and completely stripped everything he could out of it, throwing the parts all over the camp. They might still be there for all I know. We knew it was him. The drills knew it was him, simply because he still had the lower receiver to the weapon stashed in his ruck. Which they found. One of the junior drills literally forced the guy to worm his way through the gravel with his nose millimeters from the ground, searching for the many small parts of the weapon. This went on for 2 days. Again, I shit you not. Finally, someone from HQ came and took him away, to chapter him out of the army for a failure to adapt. That son of a bitch looked me up on Facebook in the months following graduation. He admitted to faking all of it, so desperate he was to get out. 

I have never been so pissed in my life. But I guess it was good that he got out before he got stuck in the 'Stan and didn't manage to hurt anyone on our own side.

What I am getting at is this: Take things at your pace. If you start having an episode due to contact, communicate this to the person you are with.

It is of the utmost importance that you communicate with them about this in a calm way. Bringing up the reason might be problematic in that situation, but if he knows about the whole thing, a brief mental nudge in the right direction should suffice.

And I know that that is hard, but since that person you are ""seeing"" seems to be very understanding, their reaction will show you that they mean no harm.

They provide a huge incentive for innovation and development by helping those who don't have the resources to monetize their worthwhile inventions do so.

They encourage especially large companies to respect other's IP and prevent them from using their superior financial and legal resources to infringe without fear of reprisal.

In both cases, a ""Non-Practicing Entity"" as they more formally are known essentially collects licensing fees on behalf of individual inventors whose work is already being infringed by a large company with vast resources.

Bonus: The other point in defense of trolls is that it isn't really the trolls that are bad, its actually the USPTO and examination system that allows for vague and over-broad patents to issue that later choke out further innovation.

6913,"I used to wait tables at a breakfast &amp; brunch place and there was this group of older guys who were cyclist buddies, spandex getups and all. So they've been regulars at the restaurant for quite some time and every time we saw them walk in, NO ONE wanted to take the table because they tipped terribly and one of them in particular was a pretty colossal asshole.

One day they come in and, like clockwork, everyone tries to avoid having them sat in their sections. Then the girl who ended up getting landed with them begs me to take them and offers me that table in her section for the rest of the shift. Alright, deal.

Now I'm taking their order and write down everything they want, which was a pretty large list with lots of different beverages and each one ordered a smattering of ala carte items. Couple scrambled egg whites here, few orders of sausage, few orders of bacon, bowl of granola, bowl of oatmeal, and Mr. Asshole asks for a stack of strawberry pancakes with fresh strawberries instead of the sugary compote. Order complete and I get all this down correctly because I'm a fucking pro.

So the meal comes out and, fucking shocker, Mr. Asshole tries to say that I forgot that he asked for extra whipped cream on his pancakes. Yeah...no. He most certainly did not. But it doesn't really matter. Whatever, I'll get you a fucking mountain of whipped cream. I come back with his newly crowned pancakes and now apparently I also forgot his fruit plate. Again, not a chance. Doesn't matter; whatever. So I go and ring it up and snag one that was already in the window waiting for an order and bring it out maybe a minute later. But was this all I had forgotten? Clearly fucking not. Next, apparently I had forgotten his order of sausage that he never asked for. 

This fucking guy. I've got my entire section full as well as this table on the other side of the floor and I'm running around like a chinchilla that just did a mountain of methamphetamine. But, like I said, I'm a fucking pro. I've got this. He's living up to his name and giving me the business and complaining and saying how he shouldn't have to pay for his meal because he's been just SO inconvenienced by it, maybe I've given him PTSD or some shit from my outrageous negligence. Who knows.

At this point, I'd already been laying it on thicker than honey boo-boo's moms 6th chin with the apologetic nice guy schtick, but now I kick the nice level to over 9 fucking thousand. I tell him how sorry I am that his meal has been so far below his expectations. I'm still going to have to charge him for the fruit and sausage, but how's this, I'll hook you up with a free glass of OJ since I'm such a nice guy and you've been so put out by my forgetfulness.

He looks like his head is going to fucking explode like Schwarzenegger on the surface of Mars without a suit. He kinda stammers some shit and then just shuts up and starts digging in on his food. Through all of this, his buddies have been egging him on and laughing under their breath harder and harder each time I've come back and upped the nice level to beyond sarcastic levels.

So I make my way back to my section, catch up everything in one round, then head back to the computers to enter two brand new orders and one of his buddies staggers over towards me and I'm thinking that he's about to jump on the asshole wagon with Mr. Asshole himself, but I notice he's all smiles and is staggering because he can barely breathe because he's laughing so hard that there are literally tears rolling down his geezer cyclist cheeks. He tells me that he's never seen Mr. Asshole so mad in his entire life and practically begs me to keep it up. Of course, I oblige, as I do aim to please. I continue to dote on this table for what seemed like the next hour, keeping 500 tons of Nutrasweet so sweet I'm giving cancer to three quarters of the planet from here act in high gear.

Here comes time for the check. I remind him that while I did have to charge for the fruit and sausage, the OJ was indeed on the house and, you know what, I'll even grab you one to go if it'll make your day better after the awful service that you got today. You have you a great day and I can't wait to see you guys next week!

I'm expecting the normal roughly 8% they that always leave and I'm not even worried about it, because they're now gone. Thank Sweet Fucking Mother Theresa on the hood of Mercedes Benz, they are gone. Well, apparently Mr. Asshole's buddies got such a kick out of the whole dining experience that they end up tipping upwards of 30%. 

From that day on, I always made it my mission to take the tables no one wanted and make bank on just about every one of them.

6919,"**Nepalese** here.

Since we are a predominantly Hindu Country, belief on ghosts and spirit is a given. Many of the older generation (non millennial) believe in some form of ghosts, spirits and witchcraft. This belief is stronger in people from rural areas, people with less or no formal education and so on. 

One of the most disgusting aspect about people's belief in witchcraft is when people are victimized and assaulted for *being* a witch. This is rare and generally happens in the poor, less educated area of the country, and is generally perpetrated by the rich on the poor. Here are a few examples -

1. [CNN - Women burned alive](http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/18/world/asia/nepal-witchcraft-burning/)
2. [BBC - women assaulted for being a witch](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-22056198)



And then there are *faith healers* and* ghost whisperers*  who swindle money and favors out of the ignorant and vulnerable by claiming to cure people from deadly spirit. The more benign form of this practice is prevalent among almost all Nepalese Family. I remember a neighbor who used to ""treat"" all village kids (including me) when we had something minor like a fever. Thankfully, my mom used this as a ""covering all bases"" rather than ""the one and only treatment"".

6927,"When I was about 10 years old I was sleeping over my cousins house. After a long night of video games and movies in his room it was really late and we decide to head to his kitchen to get something to drink. It was very dark in his house as his parents had long fallen asleep and  his bedroom was at the end of a long hallway that you can see straight across the house into his kitchen. As we leave his room and take a few steps towards the kitchen, the house only being illuminated by moonlight, we stop dead in our tracks as we notice two people standing and staring at us from his kitchen. It was us only it wasn't us, we were totally transparent. There we stood for a good 10 seconds staring at ghost versions of ourselves, their eyes piercing deep into my soul, the feeling of which I cannot even describe. Then suddenly the intense stare off was broken by when these two dopplegangers start slowly walking towards us. I make a break back into his bedroom and my cousin darts into his parents room. I hid as best i could under his bed for what seemed like an eternity, trying to control my heavy breathing down to a silence, when i see two sets of feet walk into his room, stop at the bed for a few seconds, and then walk back out. I was so scared that i fell asleep after a few hours still under his bed. After waking up in the morning, still under the bed, I look around for my cousin whom I found sleeping in his parents bed. We talked about it in the morning and both our stories matched up with what I saw. His parents never believed us but years later I brought it up to him at a family gathering and he still remembers it exactly the same. I never really tell anyone this story in person cause it still terrifies me to this day."

When we got back she was freaking right now, her mom, but all she did was cut ties and they never pressed charges. She just threw it under the rug 'cause her mom was like that. But when my mum found out she was crazy, and practically forbade me from hanging around her family for a while."

Jinn are another species living completely parallel to us and are similar in many ways;
1) they have free will like humans and make their own decisions etc 
2) they can be Muslim, Christian, Jew, Hindu, Satanist (shaitan in Arabic), atheist, whatever.
3) they will be raised up and sent to heaven and hell on judgement day
4) they have families and livelihoods like we do.

The ways that they are different to humans is that:
1) while humans are made of clay, jinn are made from a smokeless fire
2) they are unseen to us (the very word jinn means unseen in arabic. It gives root to other arabic words regarding things which we cannot see (e.g. jannah is heaven and jahannum is hell)) but they can see us 
3) they are able to posses people for a few different reasons e.g. magic, evil eye, love, revenge. The ONLY cure for this is called ruqyah.
4) they have been around for much longer than humans, and can live for thousands of years. However humans are the dominant species, hence why every prophet in Islam was human.

There are other characteristics about the jinn that I will add if I remember.

Just look at the relationship between Frodo and Sam, or Cap America and Bucky and see how quickly society assigns homosexuality to these characters.

I think a lot of straight men have no issue with acting feminine, it's the stigmatisation of feminine behaviour within men which has put off a lot of heterosexual men from acting that way. Hetero men don't hate homo or bi men but they DON'T want to be incorrectly labelled as one because of the way they act.

The groom's child-hating dog (basically a dire wolf with German shepherd coloring) tried to eat the bride's little brother while we were decorating the getaway car. And through it all the couple kept their composure and let all the problems work themselves out.

Then after the 1st hour of sitting through the ceremony, not understanding the language, I was like fuck it and went to check out where all the Indian guests were walking to. That's when I discovered the free breakfast for the wedding. Basically, it's expected for the guests to socialize. This isn't a Western wedding with a 20-30 minute church ceremony.

When they went to the florist, my mother ignored my wifes request for flowers that matched the rest of the wedding, and insisted on the most garish smelly flowers. She insisted these flowers be next to my wife the whole wedding and in her bouqet. My wife is highly allergic to these flowers, and being around them for even a minute made her heavily react. I fought with her for days but she insisted.

Luckily the florist was amazing, and totally changed the flowers, adding hundreds of dollars of flowers out of his own pocket to make a beautiful wedding and hide the fact that he completely switched the flowers.

One year later, while looking at the pictures, my mother kind of noticed that the flowers were different, but she guessed she was wrong (about the flowers being different), because who really notices which flowers you use, and she couldn't remember the ones she ordered."

Although, in our last year, when we were around 15 – 16 years old, he told his girlfriend that he had cheated on her and the girl he had slept with was now pregnant with his child. He said that she wouldn’t look after the child, and that he would have to raise it alone. The girlfriend dealt with this and said that she would stay with him and raise the kid as theirs.

Right before she began to make preparations for her whole life as a parent just after leaving school, it turned out he had made the whole thing up, never cheated, no other girl, no pregnancy. Never saw him again after leaving school and still to this day don’t understand why anyone would lie about that.

The first Humble Bundle I bought was the Humble Indie Bundle 9. I heard about from a bunch of friends who all said it was legit.

After I told them what it was they thought it was a total scam, well cause getting $200 worth of games for $10 bucks from a website is definitely something to raise an eyebrow at. 

Luckily though I did manage to convince them and I got the Humble Bundle. To this day one of the best $10 purchases I've made. "

Any large scale car dealership will take that deal in a heartbeat just to get the unit moved. The salesman is gonna try to fight you on it because your are cutting out his chance to make more money, but he'll get his ""mini"" (minimum commission) and go about his day having sold a car. Any sale manager worth his salt will know that if they don't take the deal you will leave. Also if at all possible come with a blank check.

7153,"This happened not too long ago, and oh, it's a doozy.

My friend plays in a cover band, and met a girl at a show. He's in his early 20s, and was sort of nervous as she was 18, but they hit it off and started dating. 

She was really weird about certain things, said her parents were really abusive and stuff, and wouldn't make any effort to get a job or anything.

10 months go by. She finally goes to get an ID (no drivers license.)  She texts him and says she ""just found out she was 17,"" and that her parents wouldn't allow her to know how old she was. Yeah, no.

Pretty much all of us (his friends) thought this girl was really sketchy and didn't act like an adult, though she was clearly smart and could hold an educated conversation, she talked like a college student, though it turns out she dropped out of HS. 

He broke up with her immediately, there's no explaining your way out of that, and one of our friends sent her a brutal message detailing all of the suspicions she turned out to be correct on. 

This girl immediately switched gears and started sending out these group messages to everyone, ""I just want to say goodbye,"" and making allusions to suicide. She stopped that real quick after the friend with the strong message texted her, ""well, i'm going to have the police do a wellness check on you, just to be safe."" That stopped the messages, but this chick had no idea how much danger she put a lot of people in.

- A few of us had bought her cigarettes, and my dude/her bf bought her a nice vape.

- He'd taken her to a friend's place to crash for a few weekends, which it turns out her parents could have called police and listed her as a runaway.

He never went out of state with her, but yeah, fucked up. After this experience, we're all like, ""anyone we ever date, check their ID.""

If they don't have one and they claim to be 18, red flag. "

And I can tell you what intelligence looks like to the less intelligent - it looks like a child-like passion. When the economy is good, people like those unwearied eyes, and see potential. When the economy is uncertain, so is the trust that that genius will guide us well in the dark, sometimes you just need a bulldog.

One thing I am certain of, is that no amount of genius is worth not living a life full of love. I used to think a lot of my own intelligence was a product of my angst. I am thinking now the opposite is true, that instead, angst, is a byproduct of intelligence. And it is the burden, task, and endgame of every intelligent being to free themselves of that angst by finding a passion, an outlet, and a love.

If your highest agenda is to find and spread love, joy, sympathy, passion, energy, health, and introspection, you will naturally generate other intelligent people around you. If you are intelligent, be a leader, take on that responsibility, stop being a coward and spreading fear, you are already influential, so do something good with it. Get out there and be a teacher.

7225,"The problem is that the show producer went on interview and explicitly said that ""Horn sweet horn"" is about gender identity on the [los angeles times](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-powerpuff-girls-20160401-story.html).

So according to the people who produced the show the episode is actually about:

&gt;a **trans man** who wanted to **have a body that matches their gender**, so the girls try to use science and professor Utonium's chemicals to grow him **a penis**. The stuff turned him into a monster, and the girls try fighting him until real **man** fixed him... Then surprise the **trans man** found out he was **physically male** all along bc **he have a micropenis**.

The writer of the episode never meant it to be about gender, and this message is not at all intended by the episode itself. But the executives saw this episode and decided to pander to the young liberal demographic by trying to inject a gender identity meaning to it, and this is what most of us find so insulting, that they think that they can bluff their way into being considered socially conscious.

7271,"/u/tytheguy24's story from the other thread you don't have to click: 

&gt;I work at a retail store for a major telecom provider.
I had a customer come in a purchase a pay-as-you-go phone and $100 top up balance one night (I don't make any commission on paygo phones and they're a pain in the ass for the most part). That day we had been experiencing some network issues which was causing a delay between me setting up the device on the network and the phone actually activating. The customer was in a bit of a rush so I made sure everything went smoothly and that I properly explained the issue we were having so any issues wouldn't freak him out. He told me he understood and that he would let us know if he had any further issues.
I get a phone call 2 hours later from the same guy yelling at me that his phone was broken. Apparently he had took it into his local store and they told him the phone was defective and whoever sold it to him was an idiot because it should of never left the store. This not being my first rodeo, I kindly reminded the customer on our conversation about the delay and suggested he pull the battery and restart the phone to solve the issue. He replied with a few choice cusswords and told me he was going to get me fired for the inconvenience then hung up.
The next day while I was filing some paperwork I was startled with a ""HEY! YEA, REMEMBER ME?"" And I looked up to see the same customer in the store stomping over to my counter with his phone and paperwork. As he started ranting and raving about how much trouble I was in I took the battery out of his phone and restarted it, fixing the problem.
Me: ""There you go, problem fixed.""
Him: ""What? How did you do that?""
Me: ""Remember when I told you to pull the battery to fix the issue? That's all I did.""
Him: ""Well I shouldn't of had to drive all the way down here to fix that!""
Me: ""You didn't, I told you on the phone what to do.""
As soon as I said that the customer completely shut down, mumbled a goodbye and wakes out. The kicker was that he lived an hour away so he drove a 2 hour round trip for me to do a simple battery pull.
As for the other store, I found out what rep had gone on about how much of an idiot I was for selling a ""defective"" phone and contacted their manager who I just so happened to be friends with. Rep got a 3rd and final written warning as was fired soon after for repeatedly shit-talking his co-workers. Good riddance."

7334,"&gt; The government has not stayed impartial and sent a leaflet out telling us to vote Remain

The government is definitely not impartial though, and they aren't *supposed* to be impartial. In nearly all referendums in the world the government is not impartial and wants you to vote a particular way. Why would you even want the government to pretend it's impartial? Your government has a responsibility to tell you what it thinks is best for the country in all matters. Whether you take their view or not is your choice (free elections) but that doesn't mean they're not supposed to tell you what they think is the best option for the country. Imagine how crazy it would be if your government thought it was imperative for the country to do X but wasn't allowed to tell its citizens what they believed the best course of action was. Then as a result the country did Y and everything went to shit and loads of citizens were harmed due to poverty or unemployment as a result. You would be pretty pissed off that the government knew Y was the wrong thing to do and would cause harm but didn't bother to tell their own citizens - the very citizens that voted for them to keep them safe and secure and avoid poverty and unemployment

What you're probably referring to is the ""purdah period"". One month before the referendum date the purdah period begins and spending on campaigns is legally restricted in certain ways. Two lead groups (one from each side of the debate) get one free mailshot to every citizen plus £600k given to them each to spend, and they are each not allowed to spend more than £7 million of their own raised funds on campaigning. Lots of other groups (registered campaign groups) also exist but because they are not the official lead group for their particular side of the debate their spending limits are much, much more restricted (no where near £7 million)

The UK government was sneaky and sent out their own leaflet before that one month purdah period started, meaning that altogether there was one leaflet sent out by the government outlining why they think the people should vote to stay, then later on there was one leaflet sent out by the official lead Leave campaign outlining why they think we should leave, and one leaflet by the official lead Remain campaign on why they think we should stay. Because the government's position is to remain, the remainers got one extra leaflet. The government was legally allowed to do this (or rather, did not break any rules by doing this) because they did it before the one-month-to-referendum deadline, and because any government is allowed at any time to tell their citizens anything they want. It was a typical sneaky Tory trick, although to be fair Labour did the same thing when we had the referendum to join."

7339,"Not exactly the answer you're looking for, but I suffer from moderate to severe depression so I'll give you the changes I notice in myself. For the record, I hide my depression pretty well, but am incredibly self aware about it.

First, there's a general change in vibe. This is usually when it's super bad, as it shows most because I run out of fucks to give as far as hiding or shielding it. I'll become much quieter, much more outwardly aggressive to people messing with me or challenging me, etc.

Second, I usually reach out when it gets bad. Usually just to close friends, but occasionally to acquaintances if it's bad. It's never ""help me, in depressed"" but more of a ""this is what's going on and I'm having a hard time with it"".  As a guy, it's basically asking another guy to just drink some brews and I'll open up about what's going on as we talk. I'm rarely overly sociable so that's a flag to some of my close friends.

Finally, pay attention to vices. Everyone has one and usually when depressed, they become a band aid. If I suddenly start drinking more and smoking a ton of pot, that's a sign to me as well as my friends that somethings is off.

At the end of the day, look for changes in behavior that are sudden or out of character."

7341,"I don't live super rurally anymore, but my parents still do. I was visiting them last summer and was just leaving when this strange noise popped up. It's farm country and heavily forested, so there are lots of noises out there. I may not know what each of them are, but most noises you'd hear out there, I was familiar with. This one was completely new. It was sort of like a cross between a siren and an animal howling. Occasionally you'd hear sirens from the highway or train horns, but the animals typically ignore those. But this one was different. Every animal within a 10 mile radius went absolutely nuts. Dogs, coyotes, birds, cows. Every goddamn type of animal around was howling, squawking, making as much noise as they could. All the animals I could see/hear moving around were *very* active. The neighbors across the street had a pen with various animals and they were, like, stampeding around the pen. There was a random selection of small animals eating the catfood my parents leave out for the barn cats (like, two possums, a raccoon, and a feral cat) heard the noise and immediately ran for the hills. I don't remember how long it lasted--maybe 3 minutes or so, but then it just ended as soon as it began. 

Creeped me the hell out. It was seriously like the hell mouth was opening up. That's how creepy it was. I have never heard that noise before or since and I have no idea why the animals reacted the way they did."
7342,"Not if it's a grease fire or electrical fire.

Cold water doesn't work either."
7343,"In the mammalian kidney, there's a structure called the loop of henle (well, lots of them - they're microstructures.) Along the loop, your kidney sets up a gradient of various chemicals. The kidney tailors this gradient as needed, so that when you are dehydrated, more water is pulled back into your system (that's why your urine is darker than usual when you're dehydrated - less water to solute.) When you aren't dehydrated, more water is allowed to leave the kidney and go to the bladder. 

When you drink salt water, your kidneys go nuts because you've upset that carefully set gradient. There's too much salt! Your kidneys can accommodate a pretty wide range of salt contents, but they can't handle salt water. In an effort to get back to that balanced gradient, your kidneys pump tons of water *into* your urine, and actually use *more* water trying to solve this problem than you just drank. 

In cats, the loop of henle is much longer. This lets them concentrate urine much more than humans can, and also permits them to drink salt water, though they generally won't unless it's the only water source. 

Cats are prone to getting kidney and bladder stones, and their super-ability to concentrate their urine may have something to do with it. ): This is why it's very important to make sure that your kitty drinks enough water, and to have an idea for how much urine is normal every time you clean the litter box.

Oh yeah, I know. Including Barack Obama, I'm sure. 

&gt;even though the Clinton's have built major relationships with black communities and advocated for their multitude of issues, a socialist white Jew from Vermont was in a civil rights protest once in the 60s and therefore they are stupid not to support him.

The thing about this line of reasoning that's especially obnoxious is it kind of assumes that Black Americans (and other minority communities Sanders doesn't poll well with) don't know what's best for themselves. It goes to show you that racism isn't always a conscious or deliberate effort, and even those with good intentions can hold deeply racist ideas because they don't actually know what prejudice looks like or can recognize it. 

It's a real problem. "

They've got it down to an art and use quite a bit of science and math as well. Even the older generations who don't know the scientific words for things like certain vegetable rots, can still tell you how to fix it. With natural remedies too. I had a garden for a few years and had a big issue with my melons getting black soft spots. Told my neighbor who has farmed every day since he was ten and he told me to put egg shells in the dirt. Never had an issue again. Turns out the melons were getting blossom rot from not enough calcium in the soil."

And I like sharing my place when we're gone.  We're insanely lucky to have it--it bring us a lot of happiness and I want to share it with people when we leave.  $700 is crazy, but with the fees, cleaning before and after, and the utilities it's pretty underpriced.  I grew up (at best) lower, lower middle class.  So the idea of having such a gift sit empty while we're away when I could share it with others... Maybe you're right and it's stupid.  I inherited a rental property a few years ago, and moved out of our first home, and rented it as a second rental property soon after.  In the last couple years I've sunk all my money into acquiring new properties.  So I'm less connected to any one place.

And even reading this thread, I find myself wanting to argue with many people's reasons, because I do think many of those reasons are flawed and I can give a defense for them. 

But now I am just not convinced, and I know I'll never be able to truly have faith like I used to. And the biggest part about it for me, is that the God of the old testament just can not be the same one as the God of the new testament. And even if he is, we are all victims of our circumbstances. And I just can't stand to think that a just God put a system in place that granted me by pure luck, the chance to be saved, but so many people who were born into other cultures and religions are most likely fucked.

Over the course of two semesters, they managed to fill a gigantic, industrial sized black trash bag with all of their trash. Pizza boxes, fast food bags, food, you name it.

Friend tried to take care of matters himself for a time, but with his schedule, he couldn't constantly be responsible for the mountain of trash, so it just kept growing. By the time graduation rolled around, it took both of us to haul the four foot tall bag of rotting, smelly, sticky waste out to the dumpster.

The wedding is usually the first time both families meet and it is used for them to get to know one another. It really is a lot of fun to socialize with the families. There are also a number of culturally significant traditions that go on too, that keeps things interesting.  


Indian weddings mixed with western traditions though are among the worst weddings I personally have ever attended.  Hours upon hours of ceremony and people sit there and try to pay attention the whole time.  Indian food (which is one of my favorite cuisines) cooked by caterers who couldn't point to India on a map.  Also, the culture clash between the western and Indian families make the event awkward at best.  At reception time, one group dances to their music, then the other dances to theirs. Never together. 

After the last one, I swore off going to any Indian/western wedding. It was boring, interminably long, and both families were so unsure of how to act toward the other that the whole thing was just as awkward as hell all the way through.   It was my wife and I, who are a mix of east coast Jew and mid-west redneck, to provide a catalyst for the two families to start having fun.  We started providing Swing dancing lessons.

7563,"One frequent complaint is that attractive girls aren't taken seriously. They don't get credit if they're good at what they do, people assume they coasted on their looks. Like someone can be beautiful or intelligent, but not both. If they are both, that brings on resentment.

Sometimes attractive girls really wish that would someone just talk to them like they're normal. They worry that people assume they're bitchy, crazy and shallow without even knowing them. Like they have to work 10x harder at being approachable. Sometimes it can be a burden to be extra nice all the time, like when you're having a bad day. 

There are attractive women who were frustrated because they felt like they had the worst of both worlds. What hurts is that no one will feel sorry for them (like how no one feels sorry for rich people).

They'd get approached a lot by arrogant guys flaunting their looks, money, status, etc.  Treat her more like a trophy than a person.  Big house + sports car + model-quality girlfriend.  She was just another shiny object for his collection of status symbols. 

They would not get approached by normal guys.  ""She's out of my league,"" ""She gets creeps approaching her every day, I'd just be another one,"" etc. and talk themselves out of talking to her.  Or if these guys do approach, they end up being overly fawning, awkward and make her uncomfortable.

So girls like that attract both extremes.  Treated like property or like a goddess. Neither of which they wanted. They want someone who will react to their real selves, not their external looks.

After a while some of them give up and develop a hard shell and just shut down *all* who approach, as a defense mechanism. Sometimes acting nice gets misinterpreted as attraction, so they play it safe by not being encouraging. And get labeled as bitchy. 

Adding to that, they would see their less attractive, but still cute friends get into good relationships with caring boyfriends.  ""Why can't I have that, what's wrong with me?"" they ask themselves. 

In a warped way, some of them started to believe *they themselves* were ugly. ""If I was pretty, I'd have guys talking to me or be in a relationship."" 

This is especially true if they weren't attractive when they were younger and never accepted their newfound beauty. They don't realize they've changed and blossomed. 

They didn't get attention when they were younger because they weren't attractive enough; but now it's the opposite and they don't get approached because they're too attractive. Intimidating.

So in their mind, they might still believe they're plain-looking and not worthy of attention. They might not notice the covert attention they're getting from guys.

Ironically, in my experience it was the cute (not stunning) yet ""attainable""-looking girls that were most likely to already have a boyfriend, or a ton of potential suitors. The ones who knew how to flirt, listen, laugh and flatter guys. Who knew how to charm. 

Guys would be captivated by them yet believe they had a chance with girls like that, and would chase them. I've seen hotter women be baffled and jealous at how these cute girls would just run circles around them at attracting attention from guys. Charm is the girl version of game for guys. Sometimes the beautiful girls would ""recruit"" the cute girls to approach guys for them.

Most guys talked themselves out of approaching at all.  Some of those girls seem cheered up that I would say hello and talk to them like a normal person. 

On a side note, a lot of them seemed to yearn to make more friends (unless they were already social butterflies). Some girls were just as shy and nervous and socially awkward as everybody else, but they were expected to be extroverted and outgoing because of their looks. They're held to a higher standard of social skills due to something outside of their control.

Sometimes they had a hard time making friends with girls, because other girls were jealous of their beauty and hated them.  Girls didn't want their boyfriends/husbands to meet them either. While guys only wanted to hook up with them.  I was surprised at how lonely some of them were. 

Even taking the initiative to approach guys and proactively giving their phone numbers to guys didn't always work. Some beautiful girls would struggle to get guys to call back.  Mostly because guys thought they were *too good to be true.*

""There's no way she's interested in me. I'm just imagining it.""

""I bet it's not even her real number.  She probably gives out fake numbers all the time just to get guys to go away.""

""Maybe she's crazy.  Girls that hot only go for celebrities/rock stars/pro athletes/[insert alpha male].

Everybody's got their struggles."

""I was testing a P-51 fighter in Minneapolis when I spotted this object. [...] It looked like a saucer, a disk. About the same time, I realized that it was suddenly going away from me - and there I was, running at about 300 miles per hour. I tracked it for a little way, and then all of a sudden the damn thing just took off. It pulled about a 45 degree climbing turn and accelerated and just flat disappeared.""

— Captain Donald Slayton, Mercury Astronaut

""Statistically it's a certainty there are hugely advanced civilizations, intelligence, life forms out there. I believe they're so advanced they're even doing interstellar travel. I believe it's possible they even came here.""

There is compelling evidence that UFOs are physical phenomena, not imaginary or hallucinatory. They are captured on radar that only detects physical objects, and perform feats not explainable by known physics. 90-95% of sightings can be explained by known phenomena, but 5-10% cannot.

""The government wouldn't cover it up."" - The US government didn't acknowledge the existence of Area 51 until last year.

Evidence of UFOs is compelling to the extent that to deny their existence is tantamount to science denial.

7586,"Coming from a liberal guy who went through an ""uber liberal"" phase as a teenager, I've settled on the reasonable opinion that Muslims tend to be more fundamentalist and conservative than those of other religions, and being in the spotlight as ""the bad guys"" for so long has been really divisive and only further entrenched the hardliners. So yes, Muslim people can be nastier/hold old-fashioned asshole opinions on average.

That being said, even if the majority of Muslims are this way, there no doubt are also plenty who are progressive, reasonable people and I'd say they make up a large portion of the western Muslim community. With this in mind, there's just no reason to dislike every Muslim you meet by default. Doesn't change them, doesn't make interacting with the bad ones any easier.

I've also made an observation as a ""stealth gay"" (I don't fit the stereotype really), that Muslim people (and other more conservative groups of people) can hold certain opinions about certain things without really thinking about them. For example plenty of Muslim people I've met have expressed feelings of not liking gay people, some more so than others. However I've found that many have never really interacted with any gay people, and in their minds gay people encompasses people that walk around in pink speedos grabbing each other's dicks. I've been surprised by several Muslim people being very interested when finding out that I'm gay in a casual setting (I.e I mention my bf off hand at work), asking me all sorts of questions about what the community is like, and then subtly changing their tune from ""I think being gay is disgusting and wrong"" to, ""It's not the worst thing, I just don't want to have to watch really openly gay stuff."". And that's just in a single conversation.

I've found this carries over to a lot of people with ultra-conservative backgrounds; when asked questions about their beliefs in a survey/interview style way, they'll casually express something really hateful, but are easily swayed to a much more moderate viewpoint when exposed to the reality in a tolerating, non-forced manner.

Of course there are people who firmly and truly hold hateful beliefs, and I'm not saying they are a minority in the Muslim community. I've just found that surveys of these groups can make it seem like more are hardcore fundamentalists when in reality many are just parroting what they think is expected of them.

TL;DR Patience and tolerance (within reason) is what is required to sway ultra-conservatives to moderation. Deciding the whole group is a lost cause only confirms and entrenches the idea that it's ""them vs us"" (the secular world), while doing absolutely nothing to actually fix the cultural problem."

7607,"I'm late but I have a story. I was the first to discover my boss at Ruby Tuesdays was stealing. 


I was a bus boy. The way it worked was busboys got 2% of all sales in tips. The waiters of course collected the tips from the customers. At the end of the night the manager would calculate what 2% of sales was and then he collected that much from the waiters and then distributed it to the bus boys. I know it's a weird system. 


Anyway, whenever this manager worked, our tips he gave us at the end of the night SUCKED. Like the restaurant would be slammed all night and I would get like $7 in tips total which meant I made way under minimum wage that nigh, even though I had busted my ass working.  

I noticed this trend and I asked (discreetly I thought) a few other bus boys if they had noticed it. Well word got back the manager and he called me in his office and told me with a huge grin that I was fired. I kept asking why and he said ""It just isn't working out."" I knew that was bullshit because the waiters loved me and I was always asked to work the busiest shift. I got angry at the injustice and I told everyone as I walked out, ""You guys know this is bullshit. That guy is a fucking THIEF. Stealing from a 16 year old kid. I'm going to school and busting my ass 30 hours a week to save up for a car. You must feel real proud of yourself, Dave. ""

Anyway about three weeks later Dave was supposed to make the deposit for the entire weekend (Friday through Monday) which was like $40,000. The bank was in the same shopping center as the restaurant, literally visible from the window. 

The deposit never got there. Dave was arrested and convicted some crazy story about asking a friend to drop it off or whatever. 

I don't know if his problem was gambling or drugs or whatever, but the guy was obviously a thief and a desperate one at that.  He went to jail for a while but I was later shocked to find out Ruby Tuesdays let him came back to work with an agreement to pay off the money. This is a guy who had stolen from both the company and from the employees under him. 

So yeah, fuck Ruby Tuesday's.

7627,"Pretty late to the game but hopefully apprecitated. 

I was working at a summer camp as night custodial and security. Hours are 10:00pm to 6:00am. Because of this I get really used to being alone for long hours of time and nighttime weirdness. Everything is... Heightened... At night. Noises spook you even if you know what they are, shadows are much spookier, silence is much more ominous. After three months on the job I'm pretty well inundated to all that though. So when I begin to experience some actual paranormal stuff I'm a little unnerved.

Saw a humanoid shadow cross the road a large distance away in broad daylight during my day off. Chalked it up to poor vision but it with flash like speed and soundlessly.

A group of friends set up a thermal cam in the chapel and got hits of cold spots around three A.M 

Would here noises with no decernable sources from certain areas of my office building. Kitchen would always have doors opening and closing.

The hands down creepiest moment though was toward the end of summer. 5:00am twilight and I'm starting my end shift routine of patrolling on a golf cart. I drive up to the crossroads of one of the gym buildings and begin to go up and unlock the doors so campers can get in during the day. Before I can do that, however, I see a figure. It's not twenty feet away from me and it's looking at me. How do I describe it? Imagine shadow Link with no eyes and a vague formlessness. Now make it child sized with long hair. I assume it's a camper out of bed before morning wake up call. As I begin driving the cart too it the figure moves like nothing I've ever seen. Faster then I can really track and with no noise at all it runs into the gym. I mean into the wall of the gym building. Again, thinking perhaps I'm seeing things and assuming it's a camper, I drive to the other side of the building to intercept it (perhaps it ran behind the gym). Of course I arrive to see nothing at all. I then start getting a uncomfortable feeling. Like when you stand in a room with someone who kinda scares you. I say fuck my routine, finish up quick and go to bed. Didn't even punch my card just figured it out the next day.

I have also seen the huge amount of humility and welcoming that a lot of people offer. 

The willingness to open up their own basement, food, drink and blankets to our family because we didn't have it during a storm. 

I have seen people with lots amount of Southern Pride never question me about the color of my skin or my upbringing while serving me food.

About half a year ago, two hipster looking dudes booked the unit below me for two weeks and paid the deposit. The next day, I see them carrying several guitars into the unit and they told me they love music and assure me they will only play during the day. Then one day when I was at work, about a few days into their airbnb stay, one of the student tenants living in the main house in the front texted me saying my tenant downstairs are making a bunch of noise and seems to be throwing a party. I returned from work about 2 hours early to check out the commotion. There I found about 40-50 punk rocker-ish gothy people hanging out smoking, drinking and partying. I went into my unit and I found several amps and a freaking drum set sitting in the living room. Ended up kicking them out and kept their deposit. Surprisingly the places wasn't destroyed or stained. Just a shitloads of Moosehead and Corona beers and cigarette buds I had to clean. Oh and I also found my dog with a pair of butterfly dog costume wings strapped on.

7673,"Was working cashier in concessions at a movie theater. Had to deal with this huge party that didn't bring enough parents to deal with the kids. Main mom was rude to me when buying food. She comes back after the movie asking me to change out her $50 for smaller bills (She did not state what kind, but i knew she wanted $1 and $5 as thats all the coin machines in out arcade take and thats where the kids are.) I inform her i cant because i can not just open my register, i need to be making a sale to do so. She takes candy and holds it up but when i say the price she screams ""Rip OFF!"" and throws the box in my direction before storming off. I see her go where i told her to go, customer service, she waits 2 minuets then storms back over and says ""They are taking too long, so just ring up the fucking candy."" so i do so. I then gave her all $20 with like one $5 and two $1's not even nearly enough to cover those kids games. She started apologizing as i counted out the money and acting like i gave a shit why she was acting like an asshole. She complained to my manager when she figured out what i did, and she watched as they came to talk to me, but she got more mad when i explained she never said what kind of bills, and she threw a box at me. It was a good day, im glad her kid is shitty, because its obvious where the kid gets it from.  "
7674,"One of my first jobs was in a clothing store, and no one really liked our manager, as she tended to not give clear instructions and expected someone who had been there for a month (part time too) to work as fast as someone who's been there 6 years. One day she starts loudly berating me in front of customers. I find it completely acceptable to receive valid criticism, I just wish that the manager gave me the courtesy of doing it in private. I quit the job soon after for unrelated reasons (moving to another continent), but I left an anonymous ""customer"" complaint of how I found it uncomfortable as a ""customer"" hearing a manager yelling at an employee and that I felt bad for the poor girl."

When I was 20, I met a woman online while I was on house arrest for being a stupid teenager 4 years earlier. I made sure to tell her about the house arrested before our second phone conversation and I knew she was a guard at a local jail, but we kept it a secret and kept sleeping together. My probation officer came by once when she was there and never asked her questions so it wasn't an issue. 

Half way through dating, I received what was called at the time a ""technical violation of probation"" for skipping my monthly payment for 2 months due to some financial hardships. So there I sat in jail, and guess who was my guard? My fucking girlfriend!!! 

We didn't fool around in jail, but when I got out 2 weeks later and she came over, we had the most amazing sex!!! 

Few years later I was talking with an old Probation officer friend of mine and told her about the relationship and she freaked out, said it was wrong and that my girlfriend was raping me since she was a guard at the jail. I didn't agree with her since we met when I was not in jail. 

I never looked at it then or now as rape, it was 100% consensual and I initiated it all, so that's that. 

Looking back on it, she was very cold hearted and told me it came from having to be so hard on the inmates. She would often tell me how much she wanted to hurt an inmate, and not that long ago she was arrested for attacking an inmate and fired from her job as a guard. Guess she really did want to hurt an inmate. "
7700,"his social laws were one of the most important steps for welfare states all over the world. he did some bad things with internal politics, like stoping democratic movements but this laws were ahead of his time. 

His foreign politics were pretty good. In germany we call it ""Spiel mit den 5 Kugeln"" ( Game with 5 Bullets ) for all countries equal to germany. He tried to isolate france and improve germanys standings in europe because germany was the only power in europe back then who did not care about the ""Balkan"". The problems in eastern europe were one of the reasons for world war 1 and Bismarck warned about this.

Bismarck all in all is a double edged sword. He did use war for political gain and stopped democratic movements in germany but united germany for the first time in 1871.

Where my friend lived, on the west side, nobody was home when he started the fire. He killed their cats and started fires in multiple spots and then stole the fire extinguisher in between the 2 wear side apartment doors. 

The 2 tenants in the other west side apartment were lucky enough to be woken up by their dogs so they called 911 but had to be rescued by the FD. I hate to think what would have happened if they wouldn't have been woken up. They could've died. The video evidence would have been destroyed. This was the only fire they could prove he did because they had lack of evidence for the other 6 fires. Total losses. Abandoned buildings and factories.

I started thinking of all the stories I had (my first time being catcalled, I was 10, and holding my dad's hand while crossing the street), and then realized there were stories I was too embarrassed to tell on a public forum with my name attached. Then I realized how fucked up it is that I remember and still feel ashamed by those moments some twenty years later, and I bet not a single one of the men who made an inappropriate comment remembers what that said, or even that I exist. *That's* the part that's really messed up to me."

Then again, this assumes that it's best to be self-sacrificing, which is how to be nice. However, if we remove that, then it becomes more difficult to answer. Someone has to suffer, but is it harder or more traumatizing for you to fuck your mother's body, or for your mother to experience sex with you? If both are equal, then I think it doesn't matter..

EDIT: Actually, I think your mother would most likely suffer more than you would. You'd only be fucking her body, while your mother has to fuck your body and your mind. So I think that even if we remove the desire to be self-sacrificing, it would be less net suffering for you to fuck your mom's body."

I've done quite a bit of research on this. For several months, I've been watching as many debates as I can and it's just made me realise that we're fucked either way. Both campaigns have been disgusting - it comes down to fear (remain) vs hate (leave). Honestly, we're only having a referendum because Cameron promised one to keep his position as PM. The only result this referendum will have is that we'll remain in the EU, only we'll be more angry about it.

If we remain, the nationalist uprising will continue, and hatred towards immigrants will intensify. Immigration will add strain to the NHS and house prices will continue to soar. If we leave, the EU will most likely punish us and rescission ensues, people lose their jobs and the pound plummets.

I have a Cypriot friend (commonwealth members in the UK can vote on this), and he said he hadn't really been following the debate, but was shocked by the BBC debate on Tuesday. The leave side are saying ""bloody immigrants, ruining our NHS and taking up housing and school places"", and the remain side are saying ""we need immigrants, because of the money they generate, and they do the shit jobs we don't want"". He said regardless of whether we leave/remain, after watching the BBC debate, he feels like he wants to leave the UK, and go somewhere that will appreciate him - this makes me so fucking ashamed to be British."

It is all about risk management.  If you have no real debt and no people who are dependent upon you then it probably isn't a good deal.  If you have a family who really need your income then it might be worth the risk of wasting some each month because people die in accidents more than people want to admit to themselves."

In fact, turn off all the HUD elements.

It's amazing. Because it *can be done*. So many other games are simply impossible without a minimap or waypoints.

Better yet, buy a print out map and fill it in yourself. Get a nice leather journal and keep quest notes. It makes the game about twice as long, but it's *so much better*. I found myself in a small town and vaguely remembered some previous mention of it. So I leafed through my journal and found a previously abandoned quest in said location and had enough information to pick it back up, and I *cam in my pants*.

I mean, you can sort of do the same thing with skyrim, but you'll get some fucking quest from a journal telling you to ""Go to that one cave"", no more information, and you have to open the map to figure out ""Which fucking cave"" and that ruins it for me. So if you do want to switch to Skyrim, you have to make your own story. Still fun though, with the right mods.

It seems like they miss the era when there were only about 6 relevant artists at a given time who were played on the radio over and over, and whichever artists you liked said less about your identity as an individual, and more about which category you can conveniently be slotted into.  

Now that our technology lets any artist produce and disseminate music to a wide audience, I think our generation is more about curating a collection of music that suits our individuality, and this seems to drive older generations nuts, surprisingly even when these new artists are exploring retro sounds.  It's like they want us to throw away all of this new music and just listen to Stevie Wonder and Led Zeppelin until our ears bleed from the repetition, just because they feel alienated when they haven't heard of Frank Ocean or Wolfmother, which are artists that are actually carrying on the same traditions."

7968,"I was in an abusive relationship for close to a year. 
I moved country to be with this girl, stupid decision I know now, but the opportunities that came with it were amazing. 
She thought I was cheating on her all the time, she even created a fictional individual called Candi who I had apparently met in a club and slept with. This character she would use against me at every given opportunity, to really fuck things up for me she even had a friend of hers masquerade as this non existent individual on World of Warcraft, which we played together, claiming that she had definitely slept with me. 

I'm pretty quiet about my school life, because of horrific bullying, and I just don't talk about it. However to her this was lying to her because I wouldn't tell her, she and I would fight on a nightly basis about what other things I was hiding from her, when there was nothing being hidden. She tore me to pieces emotionally, as there is nothing wonderful about being reduced to a snivelling wreck having to recount the ordeals I went through at school just to sate her curiosity and so 'I could be honest'. 

At my work place I was harassed by her if I spoke to a female customer, as they all just wanted to jump my bones... Even talking with co-workers who were female ended badly for me. She started calling the store and trying to talk to me for hours. I ended up getting my hours cut because of her, fortunately my boss knew it wasn't my fault and tried to help me get out of there. 

Eventually I was able to return to my home country, with her... She made my life hell here as well. I was always designated driver for my friends, and she would tear into me about me wanting to sleep with my 3 best friends at the time, 2 women and 1 guy. She claimed that they all wanted to sleep with me and I totally would have if I had even 30 seconds away from her. 
I was lucky, I got a spine after realising that she had been abusing me for the last year I threw her out and packed her off back to her home country by plane. Didn't stop her trying to communicate though, she'd hacked my e-mails, facebook, myspace everything. I couldn't come up with more secure passwords and hell I don't know how she kept managing to fuck with them. She would delete any women on my Facebook/Myspace even relatives. She even stole one of my phones when she left and used it's saved numbers to prank call my female friends after she left. Even now I still get the odd message from her via Facebook, she'll create a new account every now and then to message me and she acts as if nothing has happened, or anything she did to me hurt me so badly. She was a terrible human being and I'm glad that it has been close to 6 years ago that I managed to escape."

Don't get me wrong 18 year old me was a little shit, but he didn't cry when he dropped his ice cream, the gap between 18 year old me is simply refinement, where's the gap between 18 year old me and 5 year old me was development. "

Cue me landing on academic probation after my second semester, and dropping out by the middle of my fourth year. I ended up with 15k in debt and have nothing to show for it.

I like the concept of the EU, but I'll be the first to admit it has lots of problems. It shouldn't be legislating over countries, and should be far more transparent, and consist entirely of elected representatives.

*The Unwinding* by George Packer: If you want to try to figure out how the hell we got to where we are today in the world of politics, this is a good place to start.

*The Looming Towers* by Lawrence Wright: One of the best books written about 9/11.

*Evicted* by Matthew Desmond: this one came out this year, a great read.

*Fast Food Nation* by Eric Schlosser: A book I still try to reread every couple of years.

*Days of Rage: America's Radical Underground, the FBI, and the Forgotten Age of Revolutionary Violence* by Bryan Burrough. One of my favorite books from my time period on my favorite subject.

I yelled at the bear and it wandered off, only to cross the steam about 30yds down from me. I couldn't see it. I set my camp amongst a thicket of rhododendron and briars. I put all of the woods I had on the fire and made more noise.

The bear came plowing through the brush towards me and stopped at the edge of the brush, about 10ft away. That's when he started giving me the business. He growled and made other very loud bear sounds.

I was yelling at the bear the whole time and had drew my pistol just in case. When he stood up and went back down he took a stance like he might charge. So I fired a shot into the air. That sent him running.

Not 20 minutes later, he was back. He was keeping distance, 20 yards or so, but talking to me angrily in bear language. I popped off a few more shots in the air and that was the last I heard of him. Every twig snap that night put me on edge.

I've been around many black bears through years of hiking, fishing, camping etc. I've never seen a bear act like this. I think I ran into a predatory bear. I haven't been back to that valley since."

8090,"You say that, but I remember the thread about a week ago asking British redditors how we planned to vote. The responses were mainly in favour of leaving, there was little enthusiasm for remaining. Now that people have seen the markets' reactions and we all have the benefit of hindsight, those who voted leave are keeping quiet and the internet is filled with the despairing cries of remain voters."
8091,"It bothers me because it demonstrates a complete lack of respect for women - they don't care that it might offend the woman or scare her, or make her uncomfortable. Catcallers see women as not a real person but just a pair of tits and a vagina they can leer at if they find her attractive, or shout abuse at if they don't. Talk to the women in your life and ask for their experiences, it's pretty difficult for anyone to understand an issue they don't come into contact with."
8092,"I'm a woman, and that happened to me my 8th grade year and partly in high school. I had a friend who I was really close to but just didn't like romantically. He was very persistent. Eventually, he slit his wrists and took a bunch of pills then sent our friend group goodbye texts. I was the only middle schooler smart enough to call the cops and help him. Friends blame me for his suicide attempt saying if I had just gone out with him this wouldn't have happened. I was really upset. He got help apparently and then a year later he was back around our town just at a different school. I talked to him because I genuinely thought he was my friend, just had some demons. Then, he starts sending unsolicited nudes I had to delete as well as getting very angry when I make it clear I'm not interested. We lose contact after he tells me that me helping him makes him want to ""dominate and shame"" me. We meet again in senior year. He still acts perverted but tones it down now that I'm in a serious relationship. Upsets my now husband eventually, and then he stops talking to me much but still watches all my snapchat stories and gets notifications when I post on facebook. Shit was hell! There's a good side to him, and then there's a dickhead. Dudes like this suck because they literally just make nice people feel like shit all the time. "

A black swan event is the exact opposite of the butterfly effect. The butterfly effect is something small, that ends up having a big effect. A Black Swan is a big, rare event, that people didn't see coming, but use hindsight to justify. A black swan event would be something like September 11th. It was a huge unprecedented event, but looking back there were signs hinting towards it. [Here's an NY Times article expanding on 9/11 as a black swan](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/08/opinion/learning-to-expect-the-unexpected.html?_r=0)

The name comes from the bird, at one time swans were thought to only be white, black swans were thought to be impossible. Then they were discovered, and looking back, people thought,""well, why couldn't they have existed, it makes sense a bird could be a different color.""

Sometimes we can be too accommodating and I value my own culture and I don't want to lose it, and if the people who come here can't respect that, then why should I respect theirs (I do, because of PC, and I'm a nice person, but still). 

Of course we should help people, but exporting a whole country's worth of refugees and mainly good people isn't going to make the situation in that country better. Wouldn't it be better to let them stay and instead help them fix their own country (I know it's easier said than done).

I won't be so self-sacrificing that I will bend over backwards and give up my own country to ""help"" strangers. Sometimes it's okay and justified to be a little selfish.

8129,"Story time.  
Back in the 90s I had a friend in school. He was nice, greek, good looking, bisexual.  

There was one girl in school who just wouldn't leave him alone. She stalked him quite a bit, and it was getting creepy, so we brainstormed what could be done, because nothing had worked so far to put her off.  

So I played his boyfriend in school. We'd walk around holding hands and exchange passionate kisses when we knew she'd see it. I talked to some girls who I knew where friends with the stalkers friends how happy I was to be with him, and that I just hoped that stalker girl would stop bothering us because as a gay dude he felt bad having this girl following him hoping for a chance she'd never have...  

You can rely on the teenage girl communication system. It took a week to click and she stopped bothering him altogether, although we secretly ""broke up"" after a week. Our friends knew that it was a con to get rid of that girl and thought it was hilarious. I have no idea if my mate was ever sexually attracted to me, nor would it have mattered. He was bi, I was straight. We played our roles, and remained friends like we used to be afterwards. It's a story we tell sometimes about ""this one time in school"" when we're drunk.  

TL;DR: Had a boyfriend for a week. No homo."

My brother got married to his husband 3 years ago. They are quakers and during the ceremony they hold an hour of silence to reflect on the wedding or just anything in general. During this hour of silence people can stand up and show their support for the married couple. They can recite poetry, sing a song, wish them well, give a speech....so on and so forth. 

Well this really old guy that was a part of the faith got up and gave a speech about how at his wedding to his wife someone gave a speech that he wanted to pass along to my brother and his husband. The speech he wanted to give was about how couples are a team and need to work together to have their marriage be successful.... And then he started giving his speech about how marriage is like baseball. The two people that are getting married are like the pitcher and catcher. They have to be able to communicate well to be successful, even if it means using non verbal cues. He then went on and told my brother and his new husband that they would need to decide who the pitcher and who the catcher would be in this marriage. 

To be clear, this old guy was not trying to make a bad joke, he didn't really understand that what he was saying had a double meaning, just a sweet old guy trying to give some good advice. What was funny was everyone else was taking it the wrong way and started laughing. Even my brother and his husband couldn't help but laugh.

Positions are much more rigidly defined, with special rules governing what some players can/can't do as well as what can be done to them. 

Possession of the ball is much less fluid as well, with each team getting four attempts to move the ball 10 yards down field in order to get a new set of four attempts (called downs). 

The ball can only change possession if the defending team catches it in the air before it touches the ground (interception) or an offensive player drops the ball before being tackled (fumble). 

The ball can be thrown forward if it has not yet passed a line drawn perpendicular to the sidelines running through the spot where the down started. Otherwise the ball can only be thrown backwards as in rugby. 

This is a pretty basic summary of the general rules, sorry it's not more specific. On mobile and toilet.

I also read very recent letters from the British government showing complete disregard to the loss of innocent Catholic lives by the hands of British soldiers during the Troubles. One mother wrote to the British government in regard to her son that was killed and got a very insulting letter back.

Also, during the 1916 commemorations, there was a documentary on BBC, 'The Enemy Files' in which an English historian compared the 1916 rebels to ISIS.

He doesn't know about how the guy beat me in addition to the sexual abuse. He doesn't know how absolutely terrified I was of this guy and his power.

I've shared with him more details than most, but when I did open up he asked me all sorts of questions about whether or not I resisted, what I said to my abuser, and he questioned my decisions. So I decided right then and there it was one thing he and I couldn't talk about ever again. I love him dearly, but he simply can't understand how viciously I was abused and at that point I'd rather just not talk about it."

The implication is that Sherlock WAS beaten, but that the consequences of his defeat would resonate not with him but with the only actual friend he has in the world. They made it pretty clear that as long as Magnussen was alive, he could do as he pleased. That's the problem with blackmail. There's never enough favor or power or money in the world to silence it.

Most other shows would have done something absurd, like have Magnussen reach for a gun or suddenly decide to do something terrible to Mary so that the heroes would have a morally justified excuse to kill him. Sherlock didn't. It presented the audience with a problem where the only remaining option was cold blooded execution, and then reminded you that the central character was perfectly okay with that."

8272,"This thread as so many amazing stories... I feel so bad for you guys!
The most recent story I have.... 

I'm a dog groomer (it's not all ""playing with puppies"", it's mostly dealing with jerk customers, and very mean dogs) and I see a lot of extremely, heavily matted dogs. I mean, when I have to shave them basically bald, their hair comes off in a sheet and cannot be separated.... Don't worry, the story is short-ish. 

I get this matted mess of a 12 year old shih tzu-poodle mix, everything is matted together, poor thing, SWEETEST DOG though, omg, idk how she was such a sweetheart considering her condition. The only thing I could do was shave her all the way down, I did manage to save some hair on her head and ears though. This girl looked so cute, my coworker's were impressed with what I was able to accomplish, no razor burn, no irritation, NO signs of stress, again 12 year old dog. 
Owners finally show up to pick her up, dad's a huge dick to me because his dogs ""completely naked"", which is usually how people are when they refuse to properly care for their dog. Well the woman with him starts throwing a huge fit. ""Where the fuck is my dogs tail?"".... Well here's the thing, the dog has no tail, no sign of a tail, nothing. I politely say ""oh, Abby doesn't have a tail. I think it gives her character!"" Dad decides to completely lose his shit at this point, tells me I shaved off his dogs tail INTENTIONALLY because I only got into grooming to be an animal abuser...... Ok. Best part was, I had three customers waiting in the lobby waiting to pick up their dogs, all three are laughing hysterically. The two women are mocking the couple, though making matters for me worse. Dad's still screaming, swearing, accusing me of just plain stupid things. The third customer, the man of the dog I was working on at the time (Wanka), gets in the man's face, says to him ""it is literally impossible for her, or anyone for that matter to ""shave off"" a dogs tail, obviously you neglected your dog for so long you didn't notice that she didn't have a tail"". Dad felt like such a fool afterwards that he apologized to me and sulked out of my salon. 

Luckily for me, the man who owns Wanka is a regular and a request client of mine, who respects me and my trade. He also tipped me $20 that day ""for having to deal with idiots such as that man"". It was wonderful. I still can't believed it happened. "

8290,"Yeah, this is what I was thinking too. You aren't actually pregnant until the embryo implants somewhere and then it doesn't ""un-implant and fall into the uterus to re-implant."""
8291,"In this particular case, the woman started crying. She didn't stab someone and we aren't talking about a person who *did* stab somebody and calling that adorable. So let's get on the same page here: when a pregnant woman does something she didn't mean to do (because hormones) and what she did was **fundamentally harmless** (crying and wanting comfort), we write it off, 'cause it's not a big deal.

As for your second point, of course you get a pass! Think of any time you and your buddies got drunk and did something they usually wouldn't do that was **fundamentally harmless**. One buddy of mine took a dump on a sidewalk in the middle of the night. We were like, ""Hahahaha - dude, that's hilarious, you're drunk as hell!"" Now it's a funny story, like this pregnant lady crying over nothing but a silly worry. But then there was a homeless guy on a different night doing the same thing and we thought, ""Wow. It's called a bathroom."" We don't know that homeless guy. We don't know that at any other time, he would never poop on a sidewalk and it just happened to be an emergency. Because we assumed that he intentionally did that, he becomes the gross guy who poops in public, where *our* friend is just, ""Hahahaha, guys, listen to what happened last night, it's so funny!""

Take an even lighter example: say you're at a bar and some guy comes over, crazy drunk, and throws his arm on your shoulder and says, ""DUDE I LOVE YOU AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU!"" That happens tons of times. He didn't spill your drink, he left or chatted for a bit, nothing mean was said = fundamentally harmless. Now you'd be right to *not* give him a pass because he hurt you while putting his arm around you, or he spilled your drink, or he called you a fuckface - even though he didn't mean to act like that and wouldn't IRL, what he did was still fundamentally harmful at the time. Maybe you subjectively think it's no big deal, and if it is, awesome! You chalk it up to being drunk and give the guy a pass like you do with this pregnant lady. But if he *did* hurt you, you're allowed to think of him as a dick who should've known better than to drink so much and hurt people and blah blah blah. Like if a woman gets pregnant and gets a real craving for meth; those chicks are *crucified* by society. It's fundamentally harmful. They do *not* get a pass because they're pregnant.

Heck, get away from a guy having to be drunk. Say your buddy punches you on the arm after a joke. It's your buddy! No big deal! So you write it off. But say he does it at work. To his boss. In public. Hard. See how the context changes? And that's all it is: when a woman is pregnant, she gives her actions a context. The big rule is always ""Excuses aren't justifications,"" so again, if your pregnant wife calls you a bitchy worthless asshole who won't support you and slaps you in the face, I don't give a *fuck* how pregnant she is because that context does not provide a suitable mitigation for her actions. There's too much harm in what she's done. But if she starts crying that she thought you left her and the baby whe you went to go make her a sandwich, you're like, ""Awww, muffin, your hormones have made you act funny! No harm done, and also I know you wouldn't have done it otherwise.""

So really, it's not a pass, no more than a person being drunk is a pass or a person's personality. If you get drunk and kill a guy, you're going to jail. If you get pregnant and kill a guy, you're going to jail. If you get too giggly and give your friend a joking push and he hits his head and dies, you're going to jail. The only 'pass' you get is the tiny mitigation that brings it from first degree murder to manslaughter. But if you're drunk/pregnant and you fart real loud, it's not a big deal, and we also know you weren't trying to cause harm with it, so we're not offended. If some shitty little kid comes up to me and angrily punches me, it won't hurt, but fuck you kid, I'm telling.

As for your last question: dude, hormones. If your drunk ass wants to eat some tuna and chocolate sandwiches, go nuts, but it's not usually what a sober or non-hormone pumped person does. It's a biological effect, and a pretty well known one. :)"

And my perception of the Rousey thing was that she lost grace not by losing her match, but by her attitude up until and after the loss.  She seemed pretty arrogant to me, but that's just what i've seen of her.  It's fairly safe to say Rousey wasn't the most graceful winner *or* loser.


So, whatever other Redditors' beef with Lawrence or Rousey, i can't say.  This is what i perceived to be the hive's reaction during these moments, but that doesn't rule out other motivations from each individual Redditor."

I wish there was a way of quantifying the type of people like you and I who desperately want a ""None of the Above"" option in November to voice displeasure. For me, I'm considering voting Stein. I have reservations about her and completely acknowledge how it helps Trump as much as it helps Stein. But I can't stomach the thought of voting for Clinton. 

(I'm sure there's just as many people in that boat as there are people considering Johnson, with reservations, while knowing full well it helps Clinton as much as it helps Johnson. But they just can't bring themselves to vote Trump.)

In the end, I believe half the ""#NeverClinton"" Democrats will hold their nose and vote Clinton for the sake of the party (and out of desperation), and the other half will either write-in Bernie or vote Stein. And on the other side, half of the ""#NeverTrump"" Republicans will hold their nose and vote Trump for the sake of the party (and out of desperation), and the other half will either go Johnson, or write in their favorite fallen GOP candidate -- Kasich, Rubio, Cruz, etc..

But, for this fleeting moment, there's an unorganized-but-considerable amount of people who see the two main finalists are, and are having a realization of just how broken our system is. Is that a majority of Americans? Maybe, maybe not. But I bet it's a larger % of Americans than ever before in history.

I just worry that by November we'll have become numb/complacent to this reality, and our fervor for reform will be for nothing. And, much like my dad and myself, our ideological differences will ultimately be what keeps us from forming a coalition long enough to fix our election system.

On date x people were at front A, at date y they were at front B), we learned roughly how the fronts were moving (in monthly to yearly steps) and what happens at the end of the war. End of the war took a few lessons I think. Then we talk about the aftermath of WWII and the next year starts roughly at the end of the '40s or early '50s.

Nationalism makes us better, without it, we'd be lost.


This is dumb, we live in the age of internet, our culture doesn't have to be defined by geographical location. Where you were born doesn't have to define who you are and certainly doesn't mean you must love ""your people"".

Next thing I know, I'm coming out of a blackout to being on the side of a road, with 3 cop cars around mine. I look to my passenger seat and see two pizzas. I look at the road and see I vcut down a side street the wrong way. In that part of the city, they alternate which directions they go, and i hade guessed wrong.
Female officer walks up to my window, and I can hear them say ""See if you smell alcohol"" At this point, I figured I was fucked. Definitely wasnt leaving that situation not in handcuffs. But I of course give it the college try, deny everything, and make the point of ""Why would I drive to the delivery pizza place if I had been drinking?""
Female officer knows something is up, and says that to me several times. I stick to my story of ""just getting pizza and going home."" This of course finally leads to them asking me out of the car, and them performing the standard roadside sobriety tests, no breathalyzer, no backwards abcs. I know i can hold my own, and have been told its pretty hard to gauge how inebriated I am, but after 3/4 of a bottle of whiskey I had to have been showing it.
Anyway, for whatever reason, the cops on scene decided it wasnt worth their trouble to arrest me. My friends house was down the road, maybe a 4 minute drive away, so that probably had to do with it. They told me to be careful, and sent me on my way. The pizzas tasted like freedom. They tasted how sex feels.
Not long after that a very good friend burnt to death in a car do to their drinking and driving habit. Losing her probably saved my life, or the life of somebody I could have hit."

You mentioned you were only 42 when you quit, so even if you maxed out your 401k for 21 years, you'd only have $378k (plus any compounded interest) which is nowhere near 'millions'.

When women (in this case, nearly a half-dozen women) are telling you that they've been recipients of mistreatment, your first instinct is to disbelieve them and then to frame the situation so that they're to blame. Surely they should have known that the men were going to be verbally abusive. They must have been in the wrong place or with a bad crowd.

I just go to ChildFree to vent because I feel that quite a few parents can be rather inconsiderate to others in regards to their children's behavior in public. 

There are two types of discussions in that sub. The first is normal people who want to discuss examples of what they feel is bad parenting, normally either anecdotes from daily life or news articles.

I let my bridesmaids pick out their dresses (two different colors because I seriously don't care). My groom is wearing his favorite color. The flower girls are wearing their favorite color. I could give a shit less.

All I have to do is show up. It's really awesome. The groom picked the honey moon spot, a place he's always wanted to go. I let him do that because I could have fun anywhere. 

I didn't even pick out my jewelry or my dress really- mom picked it out. Because I'd rather not hear bitching. The decor looks amazing, I look great in my dress. My parents are paying for it all. So who cares? 

I got to pick the photographer and that was the most important for me. Everything else will work out. I did the seating chart and I got to plan a few things. But weddings should be fun, not stressful.

I deal with a lot of rude people as a bank teller. I get blamed a lot due to the fact that people cannot keep up with their finances. I had a kid (about 14) come in with his mom a little while ago to put some money into his account. He is supposedly supposed to be ""saving"" this money that his mom is giving him, and while I was filling out the paperwork I heard the mom guessing how much money she thought would be in there once the balance was printed.

So I do the deposit, and automatically I know the balance is way off. I double checked the account number, it was correct, so I completed the deposit and pushed the receipt through the window. The kid snatches it with his grubby hands before his mom can, and automatically starts telling me I've made a mistake because he should have more than this. He starts raising his voice repeatedly telling me I'm wrong and I need to put the balance back to what it was. The mom takes a look at the balance and sort of shrugs it off, gets a few more bills from her purse and asks me to put some more into this kids account. Sure. I do the transaction and print out another receipt with a much healthier balance, much to the kids delight.

Little did this shit know that while I was doing the transaction, I was printing out his transaction history to give to them when they leave. I passed it through the window right after I gave the kid his receipt, saying, ""I thought I would print out the recent transactions on the account so you'll be able to see in detail what processed through, and be able to see if there's any discrepancies."" The kids face dropped as he realized the $300 he spent in the PlayStation marketplace was now visible to his mom, who gave him an earful as they exited the bank. I win, you snot."

I think women are discouraged from showing anger, because it's almost always a can of ~~worms~~ *chaos demons*.

Maybe not at first, but I've (personal experience here) never seen a woman express anger that didn't escalate considerably before cooling off (even after they already got what they wanted or fixed whatever made them upset in the first place). Anyone whose ever worked retail or customer service probably has some stories to corroborate this. 

I just hate when (again, personal experience) women will actively destroy something (maybe physically, like a desk or lamp) or betray me (breaching my trust) out of anger, and then expect me to forgive them all willy-nilly as soon as they calm down. 

I mean, at some level I can understand being helpless to it, and I don't blame women for the way their emotions work. After all, I can't control how many no-reason-boners I get in a day or how my sexual instincts cloud my judgement once in a while. We're all fleshy beasts playing at civility. "

How far does this go?

If you lie about how successful you are or what have you is that also rape?

I personally don't believe that lying about birth control should be considered rape, considering that rape is forced intercourse, and no one is forcing any intercourse.

It's definitely terrible, but I think we should have a different term for it."

8699,"During 1945, the First Canadian Army was responsible for liberating the Netherlands, which they did through battles such as the Battle of the Scheldt and the Liberation of Arnhem. The liberation of the Randstad, one of the most densely populated areas in the world, is especially notable because the civilian population there was still suffering from the horrific effects of the Hongerwinter ('Hungerwinter'). It was cut off from food that was available in the rest of the Netherlands. German forces in the Netherlands would finally surrender in Wageningen, on 5 May 1945, but not before some 18,000 Dutch civilians died as a result of starvation and malnutrition (desperate coordinated air drops of food had already been staged by the Royal Canadian Air Force over German-occupied Dutch territory in Operation Manna. Civilians wrote ""Thank You Canadians!"" on their rooftops in response). Immediately following the surrender, Canadian units were able to move into the Randstad and rapidly distribute desperately needed food supplies, causing many to see the Canadians not only as liberators but as saviours.

In appreciation, the Dutch people sent tens of thousands of tulips (the Dutch national flower) to Ottawa. In the following year, the royal family contributed thousands as well, and a further ten thousand yearly since. The donations became an annual tradition, culminating in the Canadian Tulip Festival."
8700,The video of that terrible fire in a club some years ago. I think it's called The Station or something like that. Honestly one of the worst things I have ever watched. I don't like gore and death but I (stupidly) clicked on the link to the video on some stupid Askreddit threat. Big fucking mistake. Not gory but awful. Just plainly awful. The worst part is in the beginning there's SO MUCH screaming. Then as people are running around outside you realize it's actually pretty quiet. Not because people calmed down but because you were actually listening to the people burning to death inside. They stop when they die. Terrible. Gut wrenching. Just the thought gives me the chills.

8702,"People will think I'm crazy, but when I was about 3-6 years old, I was living in an 80 year old house with my family. My brother and my sister had their rooms in the second floor, right under the attic. My father told me only a few years ago that, the price was not the reason that we eventually moved. He said he always felt like somebody or something was watching. He told me some stories and so many scary things I didn't unterstand as a child came back. I know something was wrong with that house. 

One time, I was maybe 4 or 5, I remember going to the second floor to play with the cat my brother had at that time. My brother and sister were in school and it wasnt unusual for me to be alone up there, my mother could always hear me from the first floor. I would go up there, bothering nobody, play with kitty, having adventures, kids shit.

So I was going up the stairs and looked down the hallway, it was maybe 15ft long, with the door to the attic straight in front of me. I still have no idea what happened, but I remember it looking like something was passing through the door, full on ghost style. I ran, I fucking ran for my life, all while my mom is only a stairset away, not having any idea whats going on. I didn't look back, I made it to the stairs and it was in that moment that it felt somebody pushing me. Really hard, I couldn't keep myself up and feel down the whole stairset. Weirdly, it did not hurt at all. I was lying there, to scared to look up the stairs until my mom came sprinting. I told her and she reacted weird. After the stories my father told me, I know why.

TLDR: Pushed by a ghost?"

But she just fawned all over me. I indulged her to a certain extent. I didn't want to be on her bad side, but I also didn't really trust her. Something was off. After I left her 'contract' was up. But she ended up skipping town with one of the company gas credit cards. They traced her to Florida on it. As far as I know she was never caught.

There are some old people who still don't see why ""nigger"" is an inappropriate word either, doesn't mean they are right. 

""Jap"" to me is slang like ""Hadji"" is for a browned skinned Muslim. It's inherent meaning is derogatory whether you accept that or not. 

When I was growing up, calling people ""retards"" didn't really mean anything to me and was pretty much used all over our society as kind of a joke, now I understand it for the derogatory meaning and connotations it carries and not too many people use it in day to day language anymore.

Refusing to acknowledge the evolution of language and blindly hanging onto the past is ok to do, but people are going to call you out on it. It's just the nature of social mores in a society. "

They've told me multiple stories, but in each story the spirit was friendly.  They even named it Harry, and it would respond to them.  My favorite story came from my dad.

He had just returned from riding his dirt bike right after a big storm, so his clothes were covered in mud.  He came home to an empty house - a normal occurrence - and decided to take the muddy clothes off outside so he won't have to clean the mess they would make.  After doing so, he walks to the kitchen in just underwear and socks, and gets a drink.  When he closes the fridge, he sees in his peripheral vision what looks like a person wearing the muddy clothes.  Without turning his head, my dad said ""Harry, if you track mud all the way into the kitchen, you know my mom won't let you hear the end of it.""  Right as he finished the sentence, the clothes dropped to the floor.  He then picked up the pile of clothes and tossed them in the sink, cleaned up the trail and went on with his day."

These aren't all people who are living in a backwards rural area, these are people in cities, living in large metropolitan areas. And what your'e saying about Christianity itself is wrong. Lots of Christians have done horrible things, even horrible things in the name of Jesus.

8749,"I was really young and have no memory of this at all, but my dad likes to tell this story of one time he took me camping and we didn't actually go camping.

I have Osteogenesis Imperfecta (brittle bones) and had recently had surgery on one of my tibias so I was in a cast. I grew up in Washington and after my parents split up, he used to take me fishing and camping a lot on the peninsula in the Hoh rainforest. Anyway, one time, we drove all the way out there (4 or 5 hour drive) and he set up the tent, built a roaring fire, and by the time all that was done it was getting pretty dark out. So he picked me up and put me in the tent to get some sleep before we were to go fishing in the morning. Afterward, he cracked open a beer and sat on a log by the fire to wind down from setting up camp.

About halfway through his beer, he got a sudden overwhelming feeling of dread and like he was being watched. He became convinced something or someone outside camp was stalking the camp site. The fear overcame him and he immediately poured out the beer, took me out of the tent and put me back in the car, disassembled camp, put out the fire, and drove the 4 or 5 hours back to his house.

Now I'm not really a believer in sasquatch and neither is he, but to this day he swears up and down that it couldn't have been a big cat or a bear because he saw no signs of either. He saw nothing in the darkness, didn't smell the classic bear musk, and there were no big cat tracks around the site. He did however, hear the classic sasquatch wood knocking sounds, and often says that if sasquatch is real, that that was an encounter with one. Or some asshole in the woods trying to scare some dude that took his disabled son on a camping trip."

I was tasked with fundraising and collecting band fees from the families. For many, in these times, the fees were a burden. I would tell the parents: ""If you think it's expensive, it's a whole lot cheaper than bail or rehab."" Fundraising wasn't so hard then.

My boyfriend did not want to accept the fact his cat was getting old and always got angry with his parents when they said that he should give some extra special attention to the cat since he might not see him again.  
Eventually I got a text from his mum saying they had to put the cat down. They were too sad to call my boyfriend and say it to him over the phone but they didn't want him to drive his car up their driveway and notice that his cat wasn't there waiting for him. They wanted me to tell him.  
It was honestly the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I do not like seeing my boyfriend upset and I felt so guilty since the reason the cat didn't come with us was because of me and my allergies.

8893,"Piggybacking off of your story. I was raised in a private Christian school that told me when I broke my hymen (mucous lining that makes you a ""virgin"" but not really), it would be *extremely* painful and there would be a lot of blood. The fear of putting something in my vagina caused me to develop [vaginismus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginismus) where the muscles around the vaginal opening will contract involuntarily during any kind of penetration (fingers, tampons, anything). 

I wasn't able to masturbate internally until I was 18, as I couldn't get my fingers inside my own body. I had to do a lot of exploring like you, looking in mirrors, reading on the internet about anatomy, what breaking the hymen would *actually* feel like (NOT painful, thanks Christian education!). It took so much mental effort... but it paid off.

I first penetrated myself with a pencil (eraser end) wrapped in saran wrap. It just *barely* went in because my muscles were so severely contracting. After that, I moved up to a candlestick, then to a penis-sized spatula handle, all wrapped in saran wrap. This whole thing took like a week while my parents were out of town. Spent the whole week actually getting to know my vagina and how not scary it was. Amazing what a little bit of fear can do to fuck up someone's mind and body. "

We also got the UN which, while often mocked by detractors, has played a large role in providing a non-violent venue for international confrontations to take place.

And then there's the birth of the nuclear option and MUD theory which cannot be overstated as being a huge deterrent to large scale conflicts. The next country to detonate a nuclear weapon in aggression may very well be ending the world.

To start off, they were going to have some of the people play idiot, and my dad was going to act as an interpreter, one or two of the people approached the polititian with they eyeball and started offering it to him in their native tongue (Inuktitut), my dad was all like ""oh, they're offering you an eyeball, its a long standing custom to offer the eyeball to visitors, its the best part of the seal!"" (It was actually a custom, but no-one followed it 'cause they new seal eyeballs were revolting to visitors) so now, this polititian ihas to eat a seal eyeball so as not to offend the locals, to make a long story short, he obliged, and ended up eating it."

It's well documented that from Switzerland spread the hatred of Jews all throughout Europe, as they legitimized the rumor that Jews were performing ritual infanticide, or baby murder, in the capital of Bern, when the put them to trial in 1294, and it's clear that the German holocaust was modeled after the Swiss Genocide of Jews in 1349, when they built homes of Jews upon an island, relocated their entire population, burned all the Jews alive, the entire island (including the newly constructed homes), slaughtered any survivors, and drowned the children (or Baptist, as they like to put it).

That was done in Basel, Switzerland, on January 9th, to mark the Roman God of New Beginnings, and the rise of the Swiss banking sector (seized from the Jews). Do the Germans study any of that?

8942,"I am not really sure how they prepare their gyros in the US. I guess it's like in Greece but since the competition is not that great and the people do not have a general sense of what gyros should look and taste like, I suspect that it will be subpar compared to the gyros that you can find in Greece. I can only vouch for Karas Restaurant in Detroit which I have tasted and it is good.

In Greece and especially in Athens, gyros is consumed a lot. Only at least ""fair-quality"" gyros shops survive. And yes, there is a wide variety of gyro types. The 2 main types are pork and chicken, but there are also various quality grades (which mainly depends on the percentage of fat in it; less fat means better quality but also more expensive for the gyros shop and smaller margin of profit). A gyros in pita usually costs between €1.80 to €2.60 and the mainstream contents are: tomato, french fries, onion, (lettuce), (ketchup), (mustard) and tzatziki for pork - regular mayonnaise sauce for chicken. Another way to figure out how good is a gyros is the amount of meat in each pita compared to the other ingredients (the more the better obviously), how oily/crunchy/fresh the pita is, how fresh the tomatoes are, whether the french fries are something like McCain and whether the tzatziki/sauce are homemade or not.

The final and most taste-altering criterion is whether the gyros meat itself is homemade. To understand that you need to know that 99% of gyros in Greece is made by companies that basically do this: make gyros, (freeze it) and distribute it. I only know one place that makes homemade gyros and it's not even in Athens: it's in my hometown and funnily enough the place is named: ""Dallas"". The place looks like a den but it's a family business and this guy with his wife are making their gyros every morning out of fresh, local and excellent meat.

I haven't done extensive research in Athens but I bet there are some places where you can find homemade gyros. I recently tried gyros from a place that is considered to be extremely good. And it was. Really really good. But also was on the upper price range (€2.60 per pita and I ate 3 pitas when from my regular gyros place I pay €2.10 and I can only eat one and half before being completely full)."

2. Tactful honestly. Be straightforward with her about things, but in as polite of way as possible. Secrets kill relationships but I've seen people try ""brutal honesty"" and then wonder why their SO hates them. 

3. Show affection. Even though you want to give her space, you don't want to come off as cold and unloving either. In a serious relationship your SO is going to need to feel like she's emotionally connected with you, and you'll need to feel the same for her. Showing affection is how that tends to be done.

4. Lastly and most importantly (though this more comes into play down the road when the honeymoon stage is over), communication. All the time. Communication can help with any of the three things I listed above. Talk about everything, even things that aren't pertaining to your relationship, because they might have an affect down the road anyways. Things you like, things you don't like, things that bothered you at work, things you're scared of, things someone said that pissed you off, things you want to do, things that turn you on.

&gt; Whether you like Bud Light (or any of the other light beers) or not, you do have to give them credit. They sell over 600 million gallons of beer a year and it all tastes exactly the same. Even if it isn't that great a taste.

&gt; ""Craft beer is an art, macro beer is engineering"" is how the vendor rep at the bar i used to work for described it

&gt; I like to chug one after working out in the heat. It's really cold, carbonated, bland, cheap and still gives you head change (it's still 4.2% abv). Even as a beer snob, not every beer you drink has to be Pliny the Elder.

&gt; I have tried hundreds of other beers, porters, stouts, you name it. Some I do like. For maybe a beer or two.
It got to the point, I just want a beer. Nothing fancy, nothing fruity, nothing spicy, just a beer.
Bud light fits that bill for me. It is smooth, light and easy to drink. Plus is that it is not expensive.
Maybe it is because I have been exposed to beers for so long, but I understand the reason AB sells so much Bud and Bud Light is because they taste the same the world round and most people like them.

9037,"There's a show in the UK called Secret Eaters that really proves this point well. They basically track the eating habits of people who ""don't understand how they aren't losing weight because they're doing all the right things"" in secret, and then present the evidence to them after a week. They do really good visualization techniques as well, one I remember was that they tracked all the alcohol one woman they consumed and showed her the caloric equivalent to that in sausage rolls.

There are people who are definitely off by a significant amount in how many calories they consume vs. how many they think they can consume, and I think a bit of that has to do with tunnel vision, maybe they simply don't want to know?

A lot of people forget to factor in things like sugary drinks, alcohol, etc. as calorie sources, if you have a large White Chocolate Mocha from Starbucks on your way to work, a couple pieces of candy at your desk, and maybe an apple juice in the afternoon then you're already looking at close to 1000 calories outside of just meals.

And with all the misinformation and confirmation bias out there on blogs, it's easy to get bogged down in that, or in something that blames something external. It does take a lot of discipline to think of eating as something biomechanical, thinking of it as achieving your daily macros and smartly using your ""calorie budget"" as I like to think of it. It's just sad to see because there's a huge lack of education about proper nutrition. It should happen in schools and in the workplace IMO, and although I do agree that people do have a right to be gluttonous if they so choose, I think that people learning more about diet and nutrition could only be beneficial"

1. I must've been around 8 or 9, maybe younger. I was in the kitchen getting some water. It was only my mom and I in the house. She was sitting in the living room and from where I was standing, I can see my mom sitting down on the couch and one of the bedrooms. I got my water and was walking out the kitchen and I saw an old lady standing at the door frame, inside the bedroom. For some reason I didn't freak out and I just walked away. Probably because I was really young. 

2. The most recent one was about three years ago and at a different home. I was sleeping in my bedroom and woke up in the middle of the night. It was probably around 3 or 4 am. I glanced over to my right from where I could see my window, where a bit of light was coming. I focused my eyes and I noticed something standing over me. It looked like a man. I thought I was imagining things until this figure started coming towards me and leaning down. I did what any 22 year old would do. I screamed for my mom and pulled the blanket over my head. My mom ran in and turned on the lights and there was nothing there. No one believed me. I have since moved out of that place and my brother has taken over my room. A few months back, my brother saw a man in the same room as well. I knew I wasn't crazy. "

My mum was infertile, and knew from a young age that she was. She never needed to go to the chemist for condoms or anything like that because of her infertility. She would bleed sometimes, but it was always very light and not monthly, so it was likely not even menstruation. Her siblings could have children just fine, but not her. Her parents always felt bad for her that she wouldn't be able to give birth since she was the one most passionate about having a family (and she and my dad *did* eventually adopt). 

Anyway, she and my dad are very religious. When my mum was almost 40, her father began to get very sick, and she would often go to the hospital to visit him. Finally, he died when they were unable to resuscitate him. She saw nothing redemptive in any of it; no sign of peace, or of God's mercy. She just saw him suffer, choke, seize, and die. She went to the church and began to beg God for a sign that there really was a heaven, and that her father really was in a better place free of suffering. 

After a while without any kind of sign, she became a bit sick with nausea, and her breasts were tender and hurt a bit. She went to surgery to get checked for any kind of flu, and it was there that the doctor found out that she was pregnant. They were able to eventually calculate a due date (not sure how with irregular periods, but I suppose it can be done) and determined what the date would be. She was absolutely bewildered because the due date was the same date as her father's birthday. 

Aaaaand then I was born happy and healthy, but I apparently went through a strange phase as a wee child when I would tell my mum stories about grandad and the things he always wanted to do. Perhaps I'm him reincarnated? Haha"

However Nigel Farage was NOT part of this campaign and ran his own separate campaign that AFAIK never said this in any interviews. I voted to remain in the EU, yet I seem to be defending the 'out' movement a lot today...
"
9075,"Heads up: I'm in the remain camp, I'll try and be pretty impartial but I feel like my first sentence below reveals some innate bias.  
  
There is no objective benefit. There are some subjective benefits, such as more control to Parliament rather than in Brussels. (Subjective because I like that EU laws restrict our government from being too extreme sometimes)  
  
On the economy, every major economic player predicted that our economy would suffer. Leave dismissed this by saying ""people in this country have had enough of experts"". The anti-intellectualism theme was strong with the leave campaign.  
  
On losing money to the EU: There was a [*very widely believed lie*](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nearly-half-of-britons-believe-vote-leaves-false-350-million-a-week-to-the-eu-claim-a7085016.html) by the leave campaign that we lose £350 million to the EU. [Which is indeed a lie.](https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/news/uk-statistics-authority-statement-on-the-use-of-official-statistics-on-contributions-to-the-european-union/)  
Of course, the followers of the leave campaign had already swallowed the notion that the experts are not to be trusted, they'd take the word of the Vote Leave campaign instead. What makes this even better is that *this morning*, Nigel Farage of the Leave campaign retracted this statement. One of the campaign's biggest statements was retracted after the vote. 
  
  
On trade (note: this is my least knowledgeable area): We would lose trade deals and lose our access to the EU single market, Leave argued that we could negotiate access to the EU market. *Could.*  

On immigration: To remain in the EU single market, Germany made a statement that we, like Norway, must allow free movement. If we want decent trade, we must allow open borders. Thus we leave the EU but still have the immigration.  
Immigration, however, was one of the most legitimate concerns that leaving the EU tried to address. Our Working Class is suffering quite a bit in the UK as a result of 6 years of Conservative Austerity measures (cutting public service funding, cutting welfare as well as selling off state services to private companies to reduce the deficit). Unfortunately, Austerity hits the working class the hardest. Vote Leave managed to misdirect the deserved anger of the working class towards immigrants.

By getting a bit of life experience through that job, I finally worked out that I wanted to do something with my life before I get stuck doing retail work my whole life (something I really don't ever want). I got the idea to study a Bachelor of Education/Arts (double degree) at university in hopes of becoming a teacher in the future. So I moved to a new town and started completely fresh and it's the best decision I've ever made.

•Came outside the first morning with shaving cream all over his face. He said it was because he didn't know how to use a razor because he had only ever used a knife to shave, and never used shaving cream. 
•He ate nothing but kiwis for lunch and dinner one day, something like 20 kiwis, because he'd never had one before and thought they were amazing. Wound up with a severe electrolyte imbalance or something and collapsed during drill practice. Was on chit for a few days after that. 
•A short time after the kiwi incident he developed some sort of skin condition that caused lesions all over his body. Wearing clothing aggravated the open sores, so the doctors confined him to his room and told him to not wear any clothes. He was on naked chit for most of the rest of the summer, around 2 weeks or so. 
•While he was on naked chit I stopped by his room during personal time to talk to his roommates. He was sitting in bed eating a Boston cream pie out of the pie dish. I guess he had his roommates bring it up from meal for him. 
•Also while he was on naked chit a female detailer (instructor) stopped by to check on him. She knocked cracked the door, and asked if he was decent (clothed). He said yes, so she went inside. He wasn't. I don't think he did it on purpose, I think he just didn't know what decent meant, or misunderstood. I don't know.

9171,"Astronomy student here.  Part of a massive star, whose core is more than about 3 solar masses, will be blown off in a Supernovae, and the rest will turn into a black hole.  What determines how a star dies?

When a star starts running out of the hydrogen that it fuses in its core, it starts burning other elements if there is enough pressure (from mass of star) to do so.  Small stars might only get to Helium, while larger stars like our sun can fuse Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Carbon.  Eventually, when the star gets truly low on this fuel, it blows off its outer layers. (Please note that this explanation is very simplified, for time's sake).

Now, you are left with a small core of the star.  What happens to that? If the remnant is below about 1.5 solar masses, then it compresses until the pressure in the medium-weight (Carbon-ish) atoms provided by electrons stops it from compressing farther.  This is called a white dwarf.

If the remnant has between about 1.5 and 3 masses, the electron pressure is not strong enough to resist gravity; the intense pressure causes the electrons to get smushed into the nucleus, where they fuse with Neutrons (Edit Correction; they fuse with Protons) to form a type of matter called ""Neutronium"", which is entirely neutrons.  The remnant is very very small at this point, but light can still escape it; escape velocity at its surface might be 2/3rds the speed of light.  The neutron star is supported by the Neutron Pressure, just like white dwarves are supported by electron pressure.

If the core is above 3 solar masses, then the neutron pressure is not strong enough to support it.  (There might be a small keyhole where QUARK pressure or STRANGELET pressure can support a star, but we have not found any of those).  At this point, the remnant collapses even farther down. Nothing special.  Whatever is left is probably not infinite density, but rather held apart by the very definition of quantized space itself... But that's a different story.

While the remnant is collapsing, something special happens.  At a point, enough mass is contained in a surface such that the escape velocity at some distance outside the surface is greater than the speed of light; nothing inside that radius can escape to outside the radius. This is the event horizon, or ""Swartzchild Radius"" for spherical, neutral black holes.  That's all the black hole is; it's a ""Swartzchild Radius"" that is bigger than the mass that creates it.

There are different sorts of black holes too.  Some might be spinning, or have magnetic fields.  In the end, though, the quantities that are conserved by matter are always conserved by black holes.  So, mass, angular momentum, charge, spin, and color are all conserved.  But you are right, black holes are very mysterious.

9265,UKIP are a political party and to be short are a bunch of racist twats. We all were going crazy about them because a lot of us are racist twats too and were going to vote for them in the general election. Luckily the votes were spread out so they had ~12% of the population voting for them but only got a single seat (of 650) in the house of commons. David Cameron (aka pig fucker) promised the UK population that we'd have a referendum on leaving the EU to get enough votes to win a majority government so really the racist twats did win because now there's a bunch more racist twats and they all want to leave the EU

It is quite common to experience a feeling of great unity, connectedness, understanding and acceptance.  If we are very lucky, time will in essence slow down for us and we may live on in an inception outside of time, and/or our conscousness may condense into a singularity that traverses spacetime and other orders of dimensions, but somehow still like roots receding through the soil we remain intrinsically connected to the great machinery of the universe by a unifying force not yet concretely described, tested or perceived by current concepts and models of physics and beyond our limited but ever expanding human understanding.

But the overweight men are still goofy as heck.  Big dumb oafs eating cartoonishly large sandwiches and farting and falling down and ripping their pants and stuff like that.  I'd love to see an overweight male character actually treated like a legitimate human being instead of a clown.

I'd love to see someone do for overweight characters what Peter Dinklage has done for little people in cinema.  

His characters are just people who happen to be dwarfs.  They aren't two-dimensional visual gags whose *only* purpose is to sit there and be fodder for infinite dwarf jokes.  They're real people... who just happen to have dwarfism.  Dinklage's characters can be smart, charming, interesting, deep, sympathetic.  Goodman's characters are very similar in that way.  They're real people who just happen to be fat, they aren't zany caricatures of every hackneyed fat joke we've ever heard.  They have more to them than that."

9376,"Oh shit, finally my chance to shine.

Okay, so I didn't catch her in the act exactly.  It's more like, I logged online, turned on AIM (sh-shut up, this was back in the early aughts!) and a friend messaged me with a link saying that I needed to see this.  So I spent forever downloading it.  No streaming back then, you had to download videos to watch them.

What do I see?  Her and my martial arts instructor going at it.

Now, I personally like to believe that downloading a video of your fiancee cheating on you is kinda worse than just walking in on them.  I mean, it's one thing to catch them in the act, another thing to find out from a free amerture porn video.  She wasn't home when I watched it, either.  She was ""visiting family"" and would be home the next day.

I entered this weird cycle of watching in disbelief, staring off into the distance trying to process it, and pacing around the apartment trying to convince myself that I hadn't seen what I'd just seen.  Then I'd have to repeat the cycle.  I mean, by a zit on her shoulder, I could tell that it was only a couple weeks old.

The next day, before she gets home, I call the guy who linked me.  He just told me to talk to my gaming group, which really did not help me any.  Especially since, as it turned out, everyone seemed to know or at least suspect.  One of them started listing people that he personally knew she'd slept with, and he'd fended off two passes.

And yet, she always told me she hated him.  Even still, I didn't want to accept it.

I tried talking to her about it, but halfway through I got insanely upset.  I didn't want to hurt her, but there was something between desperation and anger.  I took a walk.  It... actually really hurt when I came home and found a bunch of her stuff gone.  No note, nothing.

I fell into a deep depression after that.  I loved her so much; she was my everything.  Most of my friends tried to help in ways that involved alcohol.  My best friend, a dude that I legit decided one day that he was going to become my best friend, took a different tactic.  Instead of trying to get me to drink or fight my pain away, he tried to get me to start making jokes.  Not about her or the video, just in general.  He was right, I needed to see the humor in the world again.  It really helped.

Surprisingly, one guy earned a bit of respect out of that.  He walked right up to me, looked me straight in the eye, and admitted he'd slept with her on multiple occasions.  He then told me that if I wanted to beat the shit out of him, he deserved it.  For some reason, that was incredibly heartwarming.  Maybe because it was because he was willing to own up and accept the consequences, whereas everyone else (with a rapidly growing list) hadn't.

I'm the godfather of his kid now.  He's atheist, which kinda weirds me out a bit.  Especially since I consider anyone under the age of 12 to be emergency rations.

I'm... mostly at peace with it now.  I actually miss her sometimes.  But the thing is...  We had a daughter that we gave up for adoption.  It was a mutual decision -- neither one of us were ready to be parents.  Again, something else that I'd come to peace with, until I began to wonder.  Am I actually her father?  I wonder now, because I always insisted that we use protection.  If my daughter decides to seek me out, can I know?  Can I look her in the eye?  Or will I be too preoccupied with that possibility?

And no, that isn't something that anybody can give me any advice on.  I don't want advice on it.  I've heard more than enough advice.  I gotta figure this out on my own, come to grips with it on my own, and decide what I'm going to do on my own.  The day might not ever come, but I've got to be ready if it does."

9378,"Not me but my brother. He always got calls for mike wendall. We think that mike was deliberately giving out this number to people he didn't want to talk to.

Things we learned about mike wendall over the years:

- Mike was in horrific debt. We always told the creditors that we would pay them in souls and then hang up.

- Mike owned a pita pit on Albert street. One time the delivery company called and we ordered 1600lbs of lettuce for him.

- Mike cheated on his girlfriend and the side chick once called us and we had a lengthy discussion about our relationship.

- Mike once needed his car repaired and didn't come pick it up because they called us instead of him to know it was ready. He ended up breaking in later that night and stole his car back. They wanted their money back.

- If we ever got a call for mike while at a party we would loudly proclaim ""WHO WANTS TO BE MIKE WENDALL?"" and inevitably someone would come answer the phone and pretend to be Mike. The recipients were never amused.

- One time a new employee called mike to tell him that he quit. Turns out mike wasn't an exceptionally personable guy either.

- Mike didn't make a single payment to his debt in 2 years. Then he finally made a payment of $100 on a $19,000 car loan.

- The police were looking for Mike but most of his information was all falsel so it was a difficult search for the police. He had had his pita pit repossessed at this point. The police we DID tell that we weren't Mike. But the message never got passed along for some reason :/

- After about 5 years of this the police finally caught up with him I guess. But they called us to let us know when his court date was.

Could any of this be fraud? Probably. But we were in elementary/high school and didn't care. We just made Mike's life harder than it needed to be because he kept giving out my brother's number instead of his own"
9379,"It's not only that it's frequent that makes it unpleasant, but that it's sometimes accompanied by scary behaviour. I've been followed by groups of men making lewd comments about me three times (the first time being when I was 14), and I can't count the number of times a guy has yelled something angry after me when I ignore his come on. And unfortunately these experiences are pretty typical for women. So for us, when someone yells ""hey baby, looking good!"" it's not just a compliment but carries a lot of unpleasant baggage, and if there's no one else around it can be downright frightening - is this guy just running his mouth like most of them, or is this going to be one of the times that it escalates? And if so, what do I do?

Most guys just don't have a frame of reference for the mild but frequent, casual acts of sexual aggression that women experience throughout their lives, and I think that's where the biggest divide in understanding comes from when things like cat calling come up."
9380,"I'm not a catcaller and I don't know anybody who is, so I can only speculate. I'd like to think that deep down, most people believe they're acting in a justifiable manner. Maybe they don't think it's a big deal, or hurtful? They likely don't care that it isn't appreciated. I'd say its the same mentality that drives guys to send dick pics to girls out of the blue, although I really doubt it works very well. Then, there are probably a lot of guys who get a kick out of scaring girls. I'm not saying all sexism has innocent motivations by any means."

I know my 30s aren't exactly my Golden Years, but it's hard to forgive yourself for letting that much of your life go to waste.

Somebody willing to betray the confidence of a significant other - someone whom they are supposed to be closer with than any other person - is not a trustworthy person. Somebody willing to betray someones trust, to that extent, would have no problem doing it to you if the right opportunity arose. They would throw you under the bus without a moment's notice. Just because that hasn't happened, yet, doesn't mean it never could. "

Seriously, ground coffee goes stale VERY quickly, some people say 15mins, others say a couple days.  Even roasted beans taste bad after a week or two, before grinding.  It's the oxidation that gets to it.

9401,"Freedom of movement is a cornerstone of the EU, it means that migration levels from EU countries are totally outside of our control. If we continually bring in low skilled workers it undercuts our own working classes. It also means that our immigrants are only as filtered as the EU country with the laxest migration policies because an EU passport is grounds enough to live in the UK.

Leaving the EU gives control on migration. It doesn't guarantee more or less immigration but it lets us choose, right now we don't have that freedom."

9405,"My SO has a thing for socks (and feet). I meet her halfway by letting her pick my socks out. 

Occasionally I blow her out of the water with awesome socks - a guilty pleasure of mine since I was young. 

Also another thing that isn't expensive but makes you feel / look like a million bucks is Brooks Brothers ties. 

Now hear me out on this. You say Brooks Brothers is expensive? Of course it is - it's a luxury brand! Pure silk ties and they're damn nice with anything. 

So what's the secret? Go to Salvation Army or your local thrift shop. Many times I have been shopping with my SO and her sister and they ""lost me."" They lost me in the men's accessories right by the changing rooms. 

I look at EVERY tie - determine if it's worth the few dollars and throw it in my basket. One time she and her sister hounded me for buying $30 worth of ties at Salvo. 

Showed them the receipt at dinner afterwards and they laughed at me for spending so much on ""so little."" 

So, not to be made fun of, I went out to the car and tallied up how much I saved. Turns out, stupid me, bought $30 bucks worth of ties (about 8 ties if memory serves me correctly) all with the store tags on them showing their value. They were all current store tags. 

So I go back in and say ""so I just got about $600 in ties for $30 bucks - whose the sucker now?"" 

They didn't believe. The thing about Brooks Brothers ties is that they're about $59.99 to $79.99 a tie. No cheap date buying 8 of them. Except I was for buying 8 for $30. 

Soon as I told my SO and her sister this they insisted we drive 45 minutes to the nearest store and exchange them for store credit so they could each get a pair of $300 shoes. 

I shut that down as fast as I could while entertaining the possibility of doing so. I exchanged 3 ties for their awesome deal of 2 for $129.99 dress shirts. They had the sulkiest look on their faces the entire time. 

tl;dr: buy expensive ties at Salvo for pennies on the dollar, exchange for nice dress shirts - look like you spent hundreds on your outfit but only spent about $10. Also added benefit of getting your SO and her sister's hopes up for new shoes in the process. "

She was not pregnant, she just naturally had a poochy little belly, even though she weighed no more than 120 pounds.

She asks me how to deepthroat without gagging as she strokes my Jon Hamm. So I tell her this sexual secret of balling your thumb up and squeezing to prevent gagging.

So she balls her fist up and squeezes as hard as she can alright. Except she fucking squeezes her hand that was around my dick. 

I made a noise that can be best described as a cross between Hank Hill's ""Baaaughh!!"" And a rooster being choked (get it? Choking my chicken? Ha....ha...sorry)

Had to go take GPS readings for some mission preparation. Was about to go to the last location whennnn the heavens opened and it poured for a few hours straight.

So we only managed to leave the sheltered area when it was all dark and creepy out.

My driver drove us up to the hill on this super steep incline. With the heavy rain causing the vehicle to be bogged down on the mud. Halfway up the hill, there was a flash of lightning and at that instant, the vehicle died. 

So here we were, just sitting in pitch darkness with static from our radios. My guys at the back were just dead silent. I know my guys, we have worked together for about a year, and there was no situation where they were be dead silent. Usually they were be fucking around at the back, making a ton of jokes or comments.

My commander turns to me and goes ""MHAWKS, navigate to the top and take the reading while we fix this fucking vehicle"".

I got out of the vehicle and I see that we had stalled exactly at the turn. It was so damn dark my driver couldn't see the road. If the vehicle did not stall we would have gone over the edge.

I rushed to the top of the hill to take the reading. Pitch black save for my torchlight. Fuck light discipline. Took the reading. Scurried back to the vehicle. Went off.

A few days later, I found myself with my guys again. I told them what happened, and asked them why they were so quiet.

They told me that when the lightning flashed, a lady in white appeared in the distance and was just standing and staring at them. 

The part that got to me though was them saying ""Well, when you left the vehicle to go take the reading, she followed behind you"".

While it's theoretically possible that Russia could have stood alone against Germany without direct military intervention from the West (though incredibly unlikely), allied supplies of oil, food, medical supplies, vehicles and aircraft, etc, were vital to the war effort.

It's still amazing to me how many people view WW2 as solely an American/German war, with other countries if mentioned at all, playing a supporting role.

EDIT: To clarify, I meant this as a North American perspective. European nations seem far more aware of the global contributions to the war effort. I'm a Canadian, and it's shocking to me even how few of our own citizens are aware of their contributions to the war, let alone the rest of the world."

I figured ""well, this is kind of a drag, but at least I know he'd never leave me or cheat on me"". It sounds incredibly douchey, but that's how I felt. After a while he decided to actually get a life and, bam, insecurity, paranoia and insane amounts of jealousy started emerging from my side.

I've never been to India, but I've seen this stereotype bandied about in lots of other places. A group of Israeli tourists who were on their way to the US point-blank asked me if American girls were really as easy as they heard they were. A Chinese friend told me that he wouldn't marry an American girl because American girls are sluts (gee, thanks, dude). I get that Western media is pretty open about sex, but it still unnerves me that as a young American woman, I'm pretty much automatically assumed by a good portion of the world to be a slut who jumps into bed with anyone she sees. "
9622,"Seriously. They spend half the movie with Chris Pratt sexually harassing the redhead (who is apparently not Jessica Chastain...) in ways that would send his ass to HR in most companies. The redhead makes it clear she thinks he's a repulsive pig. Chris Pratt makes it clear he finds her physically attractive, but otherwise undesirable. But halfway through the movie suddenly she's all over him like a French kissing octopus when a grateful hug or even a stern but thankful handshake would have felt more appropriate.  

Also, she appears to be *sprinting* through a jungle full of rough terrain and brush thick enough to tear her clothes in HEELS. At one point I reason she must have ditched the heels in favor of being barefoot. Then I realized her feet would be so torn up and bloody by the end of that chase they'd be useless. THEN I see that she is miraculously still in possession of her heels later on in the movie. IT MAKES NO SENSE. "

9626,"&gt; Insight in an academic way sure.

I don't agree with you completely. Children need to know the financial situation of their family. I'm not saying parents should dump their financial stress/burden on their kids over dinner, but in general, children should know approximately how much their parents make, how much things cost, and what types of things can or can't be afforded. 

I grew up knowing how much my parents made, where we stood on the socioeconomic ladder, what we can or can't buy, and how to save/invest. They told me exactly how much college/law school tuition they can help me with, and how much loans I need to take out ahead of time, etc. 

On the other hand, I have friends who knew nothing about their family's financial situation until they applied for college. Some thought their parents were well-off because they lived a certain lifestyle, only to find out their parents were in debt, and that going forward, they were completely on their own. "

9659,"When I was a kid I went to a bible camp called Whispering Pines in Alberta, Canada. My parents would send me for a week and we'd do a bunch of jesus shit, but also learn about nature and do hikes and activities and stuff. I never like going at first, but after the first day I always had a great time afterwards. 

One of the activities was sleeping under the stars. Each person was in a cabin with 2 counsellors and about 7-8 kids. 2 cabins at a time would go to this one spot with a bunch of tents and we'd make fires, roast marshmallows, sing to jesus and then watch the stars before falling asleep. 

One morning we all woke up to a bloodcurdling scream. I'll never forget it. It wasn't multiple screams and then the scream fading away.  It was a single loud scream at the top of your lungs for about 5 seconds, and then silence.  We all woke up, come outside our tents and discovered one of the kids was missing.  We looked around for a bit, but couldn't find him. Eventually we packed up and left, while one counsellor stayed behind in case the kid came back.

At lunch the management staff announced to the entire group that someone was missing and we were going to go search for him.  I remember being organised into search parties and looking around the whole camp  for him. I remember looking in the outhouses, in all the activity areas, in the woods.  But no one ever found him.

The weird thing was that after, that was all that happened. The police never showed up (as far as I can recall). No announcement was ever made about what was to come next. It seemed like life just went on. No update was ever given.  

Every couple months I'll google the camp ground and try to find any article that I can on this missing kid.  Not a damn thing is out there. Probably doesn't help that I don't remember his name, but for some reason the name Daniel rings a bell. My parents don't even remember this happening, but surely a parent would remember something like this if you sent your kid to a camp and an event like this happened. This was probably around summer of 1992 or 1993. Don't remember the exact age I was. But I remember it all like it was yesterday."

Things started to progress to where there were serious feelings beginning and I was prepared to throw away the usual ""I'm not looking for anything right now"" in favor of trying out an actual relationship. The day I planned to drop that bomb he told me he met a girl he liked. Welp. That sorta killed that whole idea. I let him go. Looking back now I wonder if I should have fought for a chance at a relationship but to be honest, I don't know if the people we were then would have lasted if we had tried. We stayed friends over the years. They moved in together, I became friends with her too. I moved on with my life and had other relationships. About 3 years ago, I was single and we all started hanging out more often. I fell ass-backward into a poly relationship with the two of them, moved in with them, and for awhile it was great. I never expected to do anything like that, but I truly did end up with feelings for both of them for a long time. She and I fell apart due to her difficulty communicating. The triad became a V which worked for awhile with him as the pivot point, but it got harder and harder to know where boundaries lie, especially since I still had feelings for her. Then, she ended up trying to pull ye olde ultimatum on him instead of talking it out like an adult. I probably would have just moved on alone if she had come to us honestly and told us she wasn't okay with it anymore. She sabotaged herself, though. She was vindictive and childish through the entire process. I'm sure she blames me for everything, and that's okay. If it makes it easier for her to sort out and grow up in the end, she can vilify me. He and I learned a hell of a lot about ourselves personally and as a couple that came from a trouple, as it were. It was a top-down experience that people don't usually get. He had to make a very tough decision, between a girl he had been with for 6 years but saw no forward movement with, and taking a risk on me who he had more faith and future outlook with but had only been around again for about a year. We took the leap. Fast forward 2 years and we have bought a house, are getting married and are planning a family.

What made that worse was how some of them met up with me to apologise for that but A) I knew their parents made then do it and B) they tried explaining why they did it like they were justifying it.

My buddy went from extremely shy and sad looking to lively and happy to be alive. The best part? Every single person he knew including his family accepted him without one negative word said. I always wanted to tell him before he came out that I know he's gay and I know that's why he's depressed but for some reason I didn't want to talk to him about it and figured it would be best if he came out on his own.

9761,"When I was raised I was more devout than almost all other kids I knew.

Two things that began to drive me away. The first was realizing how impractical it is to apply the Bible to everyday life. And also that anything that *could* be of use did not require being religious.

For example- Do unto other as they would have you do unto them. Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Thou shalt not lie.

Well, I won't argue about those being good ideas. But are they good ideas because *God said* or, are they good ideas *on their own merit*. (not to mention that sometimes it's not immoral to exhibit opposite qualities, like sometimes lying is not immoral). I contemplated this for years until I found out that the ancient Greeks beat me to it. It's called the [Euthyphro Dilemma](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro_dilemma)

Whereas - Thou shalt not worship other gods. Paul's teachings about staying away from non-believers, and general theology just simply had no connection to living my life today. I was taught it's important to know the Bible but what did it do for me?

This was all years. And it's a much longer story. Ultimately, I no longer believe he exists.

I'm not saying that this *proves that God does not exist.* But if he does, he knows my whole story and situation far more in depth than *I* do. And he does nothing to show me He exists. And if he sends me to hell for it, than that's a god I want nothing to do with. It appears that the moral thing would've been to have not created me at all.

I heard a really good preacher that my dad had listened to on local radio. He did a *really* good way of expressing Christian beliefs that were very different than what I had heard growing up. I mean, he actually explained things, instead of just saying ""Trust me. Trust the church"". It was more like ""You *can* trust me, but I'm just one guy. You really ought to read and study this stuff too. We'll answer any questions you have"".

That was refreshing.

Then I started going to a Bible study with my dad out of curiosity. It was led by the same preacher, and again, he did a *really* good job of explaining scripture. It started me down the path toward belief.

That was 20 years ago. Since then, I kept studying, started praying, and started believing. I eventually became a teacher myself, and last year I became an ordained minister."

She had 3 younger siblings and I have no idea what they were told or how they handled it but I feel awful for them and for her parents. It's a cliche in these sort of things but I got no indication at all that she wasn't normal. I went to a Christmas party with her family and they were all very friendly and normal/nice idk what to say about that. 


I guess the weirdest part for me was you know that speechless feeling because you just ran into someone from a story you actually heard about? That's the exact feeling I got all the time except I was in the middle of it. Like there was this national news story popping up all over the place and it was referring to something essentially from my personal life. I'm not saying I was involved in any way (I had absolutely no idea) but what I'm saying is that without even looking for news I would log onto yahoo to see my mail or something and right there on the front page is a mug shot of my (ex) girlfriend. Like imagine if you went onto the New York Times or cnn and saw a mug shot of your girlfriend (I did both of those things). It was absolutely surreal none of it felt like real life at all. I still am not sure I've processed it, it's almost strange how much life has just gone on since then as if I wasn't right next to this giant news story. The FBI interviewed me but it hasn't affected my life since then at all other than, you know, the emotional damage.


ninja edit: also I kept seeing quotes from the courtroom that made her sound like an absolute psychopath and it's hard to connect that person to the person that I knew. It was also hard at first to read the descriptions of her walking in in chains crying. Like one day she was the person I spent the most time with and the next she was a psycho criminal. Like I guess people would think you just all the sudden don't like the person anymore but it took longer for that for my feelings to catch up to reality. Like I said it doesn't seem real but just try to imagine the FBI showing up at your door to pick up your girlfriend on a murder charge and it's all completely true. It's impossible to process.

It seems, well in my experience, that girls just want a somewhat confidant, relaxed, laid back, ambitious to some degree, man, who can take care of himself, is mostly patient, and as far as looks go, the bar is set pretty low already. So if you can meet that above criteria then you should be solid.

Men also need to learn a few signs, she may not be attracted to you, it doesn't mean you're unattractive to everyone. 

Also gentleman... Never ever!!! Ever! Go way out of your way for a girl you just met. Buy her a few drinks, take her to a movie. Do not smother her when you don't even know if you guys will be a thing or not. 

She said yes to a first date, she is not your girlfriend, any girl who thinks they are entitled to free food and drinks and overall being smothered,  is probably not worth your time to begin with.

&gt; To keep their bones strong, historical accounts say, they downed vile brews of charred wood or bone ash, both of which are rich in calcium. Whatever the exact formula, the stuff worked. Grossschmidt says that the calcium levels in the gladiator bones were ""exorbitant"" compared to the general population. ""Many athletes today have to take calcium supplements,"" he says.

9989,"The nephew of an MP was a real slacker and had a cocaine problem. The guy wanted to finance his addiction and get rich by dealing with cocaine. He lent drugs worth ~15'000 USD from his dealer. Instead of doing business he used it for himself and his friends and had a 3-days orgy. 

The dealer asked him where the fucking money was, so he decided to disappear for a while. That didn't work so well because he's a real idiot. So, the dealer and some of his friends drove to the place of the idiot's girlfriend and threw him in the boot of the car, driving to some random garage.

They tied him up to a chair and while the idiot wailed they explained him calmly that he can chose from those things in the garage which he would like to have stuffed up his arse. He chose a plastic bag. 

Meanwhile and without the idiot's knowledge, one of the guys called his uncle the MP to sort things out financially for the financial loss. It wasn't the first time the guy called him because his nephew had a real gift for turning gold into turd.

So, the guy cried and cried while the others had a hard time keeping a serious face. After a while the idiot's uncle came with the money and they let him go. 

Later news about the idiot was that he had inherited a huge ranch in Brasil from his late father with dozens of horses etc, worth a seven digit number. He tried to keep it running but got raided a couple of times by some small-time thugs. So he traded it against an apartment in Rio, which was not even worth 250'000 USD. 

Now, he's back in Switzerland, working again as a pennyless construction worker. "

It's not as if there's conscious or subconscious mandate keeping, lets say, all black peopke in areas where income is low and education is poor, and these disadvantaged areas aren't restricted to minorites. It's most likely residual poverty from the segregation era and a reluctance to enact change because the situation seems so shitty.

10013,"I get you're point, and I agree it should be that way, but I don't think that's the reality of it.

If I said ""Muslims are evil because they bomb people"" most people would say ""not all Muslims do that"" which is completely true and definitely should be said, as blaming an entire group of people on the actions of a few is wrong.

Same with ""black people are criminals"", this is a very prejudiced and incorrect statement, one that someone should be called out on for saying.

So what do people say? "" some muslims..."" which is what should be said. However as soon as it's ""men.."" followed by a broad and sweeping statement about a personal negative experience, it's so obviously not *all* men, how dare they get defensive about having just been told you're a shirty person; and it is that, as saying something about ""men"" definitely means every single man. If a man publicly said a defamatory statement about ""women"" he'd get hugely criticised for it; but why are feminists getting defensive, it didn't mean *all* women.

This whole comment may read as argumentative, it's not supposed to be. It's so massively obvious that it's not about all men, but the double standard is there and it shouldn't be. Maybe ""this man did X"" or ""some men are like this"" is it really that hard to say some? It would definitely save a lot of all those patronising people talking to you about how they don't like to be personally told they're not a nice person."

I was out for several minutes.  The paramedics said that I died and was revived by my mom.

During that time I was (in my mind) laying on the precipice of a waterfall. Water was rushing over me, not in a bad or good way, but it was loud and I couldn't hear anything.  White washed over me.  The current pulled me closer to the cliff but something held me back.  Eventually I heard a paramedic asking me to squeeze his hand if I heard him, which then became the hand holding me in my death dream.

10059,"**Slape**.    
&amp;nbsp;

*Slape is defined as the act of a female deceiving a male into supporting a pregnancy or child that is not biologically his.  Support is defined as both tangible and intangible resources such as money, wealth, time, attention, and emotional devotion on the male's part.  The deception begins 24 hours after the moment the woman learns she is pregnant, knows it is possible that it is not her presumed partner's, and fails to tell him.  This act is separate from cheating or sex outside the relationship.*    
&amp;nbsp;

*(Note: A woman who takes tangible measures to obtain an abortion within the 24 hour period of discovering a pregnancy that is possibly not her presumed partners, and follows through with the abortion, would be exempt from this definition.)*    
&amp;nbsp;

Depending on the length of the deception **slape** needs to be turned into a Class D, C, and B felony.  This is one of the most heinous acts a woman can commit against a man.  Imagine being a man and finding out your three kids are not yours at age 65.  You no longer get to have biological kids of your own.    
&amp;nbsp;

We have estimates that between 2 - 10% of all fathers are a victim of this (still legal) crime.*  I know more attention is being given to female on male rape, but I honestly feel **slape** is a much more serious issue given its preponderance.    
&amp;nbsp;

Some refer to this act as ""paternity fraud"", but the term **slape** is much more accurate.  ""Paternity fraud"" is a grossly and disgustingly understated term for what this act really is.  That's like referring to rape as ""intercourse theft"".

Like, Germany's recent big-guilt is the Holocaust (71 years ago)

Canada's is the Residential Schools (...20 years ago)

But literally every society has had slavery, and they're not typically so bent out of shape about it.  The British/Portugese/Dutch/Spanish were huge players in the North American/African slave trade.  Do they beat themselves up about it?  I honestly don't know.

I know for damn sure the middle east isn't bent out of shape about the Barbary slave trade that was raiding Europe/Iceland in the 1600's.

C-14 has a half life of 5600ish years.

What scientists will do, is they will take a sample of C-14 out of the fossils, and compare it to the expected amount for a living thing (this is pretty consistent across all life). if the C-14 is exactly half of what would be expected, we know it was 5600 years ago.

This runs under the equation:

p = e^(-0.0000537553*t)

where p is the fraction of C-14 that is left over (1/3,3/10,etc.)

If you rearange this, you get

ln(p)/(-0.0000537553) = t

When I was about 20 and a horny toad, one evening I had a but too much of a rigorous wank - lets just translate that as a furious masturbation session. An unhappy toss. Call it what you will. At the time it was vigorous and not really satisfying but after some time and a lot of muscle ache in my arm my objective was reached and I got my rocks off.

The next day I was commuting to work on the train and felt a desperate need to pee. Not just a desire but a full-on fucking code red gotta pee or piss myself scenario. I was lucky - I was on a commuter train and there were toilets. I checked myself in to the cubicle and tried to piss. I managed a thimbleful.

However the urge to piss was horrendous on the train, I returned many times to the bathroom but nothing would come out. No relief - just this dire need to strain the lizard.

When I got to the station the desire alleviated and I was able to walk to work. All seemed ok and at work I was fine. But that night on the train exactly the same thing. As soon as it reached any speed my teeth started floating and my old chap was aching to urinate - it was fucking horrible.

This went on for a week. I would get on at Liverpool Street Station and have to get off at Stratford 10 minutes down the line for the most non-productive, unsatisfying piss of my life to wait 30 minutes for the next train to travel for 40 more minutes of sweating, genuine pain and full on prostate self-compaction. It was fucking hell.

It was not just trains. Buses - just any form of vibrating transport and I had the worst desire to piss. It was horrible. My dad giving me a lift to the station could not understand why I was squirming in the seat. It was horrendous.

I couldn't talk to anyone - especially not a doctor. It was too embarrassing. A week had gone by and I was really up the creek. But one night I was also horny and decided I needed to self sort myself as it were. I was already up shit creek so what would one more do? So I choked the chicken furiously that night and painted the curtains. Yeah it was wrong with all that was malfunctioning down there but by then I didn't care.

The next day I caught the train almost in tears at what was coming. Another ride locked in the toilet straining to piss when nothing was there. But for some reason not this ride - all was fine. So was the ride home. And so has every ride since. 2 wrongs it seems make a right in this case. 

TL: DR - I think I must have dislodged my prostate through masturbation and then wanked it back into place again a few days later."

10157,"I was poor in college so I rarely bought alcohol or weed. My roommates were super cool and always shared but it did hurt my pride just a little. A friend from high school going to a different college randomly gave me two handles of cheap gin one night when I visited him. I kept them under my bed and finished one over a couple of weeks. Gin is aweful. Well, we had a party one night and I broke out the other handle. I had a handle of gin and a 2L of coke. I was not a big liquor drinker and too cool to call it quits. I remember very little after the coke was gone except that I kept drinking straight warm gin out of a solo cup like it was nothing. This was also my first time blacking out and when my roommates said I needed to settle down, I remember, like the young college philosopher I was, saying something along the lines of ""I haven't blacked out because I remember this."" They later said I was saying this during parts of the night I don't remember. I then remember getting out of bed and stepping on something. My roommate is like ""dude, you just stepped on your laptop!"" Me? ""I'll deal with it in the morning"" as I head to the bathroom. Don't remember reaching the bathroom. Next morning, get up to go to the bathroom, still very wasted, and my roommate is cleaning my shit off the walls and it is everywhere. He says cooly, ""go back to bed."" I tuck my tail behind my legs and do just what he said. And this guy, still one of the coolest guys I've ever met, never tells a soul or mentions it again. I thanked him later but still owe him all the gratitude in the world. Love you, Omar. Oh and I cracked my touchscreen laptop's screen, not the worst punishment."

10217,"Actually, trans refers to someone whose gender identity is 'other' than the one assigned at birth. It doesn't refer to the process of transitioning. So non binary genders are a subsection of trans identities. It comes from Latin- trans = across/ on the other side of, whereas cis (from which the term cisgender comes) means on the same side of. It's also used in chemistry- trans or cis isomers.

And non binary people get a lot of hate even where some people have stopped hating on binary trans people (though that happens *all the time*): [even in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4psbt0/what_part_of_reddit_culture_annoys_you/d4njxjw).

However in reality you are going to be a lot happier, and have a far more enjoyable life if you learn to conform to some social norms. 

It's all about boundaries, and recognising that not everyone is interested in the same things you are, or finds the same things funny. It's impossible to get to know everyone you meet in depth, so you will be judged on first impressions. I will negatively judge the teenager running around and pretending to be a ninja - and so will the rest of society.

One night, at about 10pm, and this shiny, brand new Holden Statesmen (fancy Australian V8 sedan) with two people in it pulled up. I went to the window and the driver was young. Like, easily 16. He asked for a 6 pack of beer and a bottle of rum. I asked to see his ID and he said he didn’t have it and then pulled out the “I’m obviously 18 because I’m driving this nice car” line. The barely pubescent monkey sitting in the passenger seat nodded nervously in agreement and stammered “yeah, he’s 18….” I explained to them that I needed to see valid ID in order to complete the transaction. They tried all the other lines including the “I left me fucken wallet at home” excuse and the classic “Carn, mate. No one will know” line.

After about 5 minutes of arguing they decided to try another venue. They drove down the end of the driveway and the passenger leaned out the window and screamed “YOU’RE A FUCKEN WANKER, MATE. FLOOR IT DANNY!” 

Danny did indeed floor it. He slammed down the accelerator and screamed out of the driveway with the rear wheels howling and smoking. Danny may have been good at flooring it but Danny didn’t understand basic physics and the car fish-tailed into the telephone pole 20m from the Drive Through exit. After I stopped laughing I went and checked if they were injured. They were perfectly fine but the kid called Danny was hysterical because his Dad was going to kill him for stealing and then wrecking his brand new Holden. Easily the second funniest thing I witnessed while working there.

Edit: Funniest thing - Same situation but another guy served them. Girl in front seat didn't have ID and wanted a can of Jim Beam and cola. My coworker refused her so her boyfriend bought it which wasn't exactly kosher either. An argument ensued but my coworker relented. He went and got a can but took ages. He gave it to the girl and they drove off. As they got to the end of the driveway she yelled out that he was a cunt and was going to die alone etc. Then she opened the can. It exploded inside the car, coating the read window in cheap redneck bourbon and cola. My coworker had spent a good couple of minutes shaking the shit out of the can."

10302,"Now normally, I don't swear at all, and try to be very polite. I was 40 weeks and 4 days pregnant with my second child.  I had been in labor for over 24 hours, and went to the hospital to have the baby, but they sent me home since I wasn't dilated.  So I was upset, and decided to go get my nails done one last time before baby to pass the time.  Hubby came with.  The lady doing my nails was making small talk, but I was having contractions every 3-5 minutes or so (she was unaware of this).  The lady obviously saw that I was pregnant and asked me when my due date was.  I replied with a heartfelt ""fuuuuuuuuuuck you!"".  My husband looked at my like he was appalled at what had just come out of my mouth, but I think he was too afraid of me in that moment to say anything.  the nail lady didn't say another word.  Baby was born about 3 hours later."
10303,"We just moved to this house about 6 months ago, and my wife became pregnant 3 months ago, so we're still early on. She's already having slight mood swings, but she also wants to do a lot before the baby arrives in December, like paint the house. 

Of course, being the nice guy I am, I decide to do this for her to get it started at least, so I'm painting the trim until I ran out of paint for the day. I wanted to surprise her to kind of let her know I started the groundbreaking phase of the painting. It was a surprise planned by me and my mother in law.

She came home, and gave me an unbelievably evil look.

""WHY DOES IT SMELL LIKE PAINT IN HERE?!""

Me: 'I have a surprise for you.'

And she went in the entry way, critiqued everything, basically said it was a shitty job without saying it, and went to bed. 

Her mother texted me and asked how the surprise went, and I simply said 'I feel like I got stabbed with the wooden end of the paint brush.'

This was yesterday.

10318,"I was a manager at a large pet store chain for a few years. The blue one, not the red one. Anyways, we were right next to a very rich area. Entitled customers were normal, as was loading cat trees in brand new BMW and Mercedes. People not speaking our cashiers because they ""don't talk to the help"" happened more than once. 

One day a woman who had to be in her sixties came in with her husband in tow. She wanted to return a pricey shock collar. As the manager I had to authorize returns. As soon as I reach the register I see the look on the cashiers face and know this is going to suck. The customer was border line yelling and wagging her finger at me and dressing us down for selling a bad product. The collar cost almost $200 so ofcourse i dont want to just take it back. I test the collar and the light goes off showing it works. She snatches it out of my hand, presses the prong to her hand and hits the button. Somehow she doesn't feel anything and asks if I'm retarded. I calmly take it back and turn the setting from 2 to 1, and test it on my hand. It shocked me. This lady just doesn't have full feeling in her hand. She calls me a liar when I say I felt it and she snatches it back again and cranks it up to the max level. She felt it that time. She let out a scream and jumped and spun around in place. She then just stormed off, leaving with the collar. Her husband looks at us and I thought he would burst trying not to laugh. He just thanked us for our time, gave the cashier a $5 tip, and left."

10325,"Teen Titans Go, there was an episode that was hyped continually on cartoon network called ""The Return of Slade. Now, with many fans of the old Teen Titans hating Go because of how they writers treated the characters and concept  when they heard that Slade was back many of the actually decided to to give this episode a try and see if it could be decent. When the episode started the Titans constantly bring up Slade returning to hammer in the fact that: yes Slade, the big bad guy from the old show is back and ready to fight. So with the Titans ready to go and fight Slade and stop what ever evil plan he has, they head out of the tower to face him... and comeback almost immediately talking about how ""action packed"" the fight was, and ""how many deep and interesting plotlines began and ended"" because of the confrontation. So because of the apparent defeat of slade the Cyborg and Beastboy decode the best way to celebrate is to get a clown that they remember so fondly from the childhood. Now its at this point the writers are using Cyborg and BB as pseudo-strawmen (strawcyborg?) for the old fans of the show who hate on Go because of what they did to the old characters they loved as kids.While in contrast they use Raven and Robin (maybe Starfire too I don't remember off the top of my head) as their voice to the old fans on how they [The viewers,CB and BB] are way too old for this thing the remember they loved so much and how it for kids and they need to grow up. When they clown comes to the tower Beastboy and Cyborg are initially super excited because this clown ""brings back such great memories"" from their childhoods and how the music the clown plays  ""means something great is going to happen"". The music being an analogy for the the old shows opening music which always played right before an episode. As the clowns act goes on CB and BB become more and more displeased with the act saying how ""this isn't how [they] remember his act this way"" and Robing responds with how this is ""a classic clown act"". CB and BB follow up to Robins and Ravens remarks that ""clowns are for little kids""  with that when they were kids ""clowns were cool and had depth and meaning"" causing Robin to say ""clowns were never cool and they are letting nostalgia cloud their memory"". So to try and fix the clown they loved from their childhoods, CB and BB make him cooler by making him a violent sociopath which begins to attack Robin with Raven saying how they "" took something that was meant for kids and turned it inappropriate, just so they could enjoy something they've outgrown"". Now with this new crazy clown loose in the town the Titans have to stop it before it ruins all child entertainment with it inappropriateness. CB and BB, now being scolded by Robin and Raven say they ""lost sight of what made clowns cool in the first place, being age appropriate entertainment"" and ""how they can't hold on to their childhoods forever"". So the Titans head out to a toy-store the clown is in, turning all the kids friendly toys in to violent and mean versions of themselves and end the clowns crime spree by making him remember what he used to be like before he changed which ends up failing and causing Cyborg to say "" childrens entertainment is doomed"" but Starfire ends up just punching the clown in the face and saving the day. 
So of you were to replace every instance that the writers put ""clown"" with "" cartoons"", Beastboy and Cyborg with the old fans, and Robing and Raven with the writers, what you get is a bunch of writers saying that, ""no this show doesn't suck you guys are just way too old for cartoon and are just hating this new thing because it isn't what you grew up with"" and that they need to ""grow up and stop watching kids shows"". Now I loved the old show as a kid, I still watch it from time to time just to relive it (personal favorites being Mad Mod and Car Trouble). With this episode not only being a ratings trap with Slade and the constant berating of the old fans by the writes just puts a sour taste in my mouth and just makes me thing how shallow these writers seem to be and makes me hope even more that this show either gets a hell of a lot better or just stops.

Just life in general in korea is pretty fucked up.

Highest suicide rate in the world, and office life is the definition of a rat race. Going to a good university is quite difficult, with many people releasing stress with alcohol, games and cigarettes.

Students are stressed into overstudying, often coming home at 1am from cram schools and are just in general overworked. Suicide while not common, is much higher than in other parts of the world for students. Social hierarchy and bullying is much worse than other parts of the world, and are very underadressed issues.

10383,"Clearly, the functional difference is the presumption that children are young and uneducated. 

It's saying ""We need to teach children not to do drugs because drugs are a prevalent issue in our society that they aren't aware of and should have positive role models impact them such that they can handle drugs responsibly.""

The goal is to educate children about drugs before they can have negative influences lead to them.

Furthermore, you're using an odd context (as said before, children are young and impressionable). It's the same way I feel like it'd be sexist to say 

""We need to teach women to drive properly"" or  
""We need to teach women to learn how to handle money better"" 

However, most poignantly, it's an encompassing portion without objectively discriminating on a lot of things. 

In the same way you could say ""We need to teach children not to do drugs"", you could say ""We need to teach black people not to do drugs"", but that's just stupid. You could say ""we need to teach adults how to be more fiscally responsible"", but you couldn't say ""we need to teach all arabs to be more fiscally responsible"".

10385,"Sure, there are a lot of rape stories that start with the victim being cohersed into sex. Sometimes the perpetrator doesn't even realize they're doing it (emotional distress, threatening suicide, etc). Hell, sometimes the victim doesn't even realize what's happening is rape because technically they consented. We don't talk about this kind of assault and many people would consider it a moral gray area. Personally, I don't think there's anything gray about it. 

Imagine a scenario in which a woman is breaking up with her boyfriend. Broken by the news, he can't handle the stress and begins threatening suicide if she doesn't stay with him. To ""prove"" that she's with him, he demands she continue sleeping with him, whenever she tries to distance herself, he tells her he'll kill himself if she does...that's rape, but nobody treats it that way. It's easy for people on the Internet to say ""well yeah, definitely"" but if she tried to seek support, most people would probably say something insensitive like how she should have just let him kill himself or how it's not rape because she let it happen. A jury is unlikely to convict him because he was under immense stress and can claim that he didn't realize he was forcing her to be with him. And the worst part is that he might very well be telling the truth, because we don't teach this kind of scenario, sure we teach ""no means no"" but we need a broader discussion in order to bring focus to the less obvious ways that assault rears it's head.

I think my example is actually pretty common with the genders reversed. I've even seen here on Reddit a man tell this story with his girlfriend as the perpetrator and roughly half the comments were ""Yeah sure, she *raped* you by asking you to sleep with her""...

Related, this same dialog would help with abuse victims, as emotional abuse like this affects both genders and is difficult to both identify and get support for. "

10391,"Just a word of advice, that is really hard to accept/believe before you learn it yourself: 

You should be gabbing about breeding for natures and IVs. You're gonna strike out more, but the people you get a chance with are infinitely more likely to be capable of having a healthy, fulfilling relationship with you. (*I'd like to add this doesn't have to mean they care about exactly the same things. As long as they appreciate your interests, you're good to go)

The only time you should tone down is if you just want to casually date to get experience. But if you're *really* looking for a girlfriend or boyfriend, you'll be far more successful in the long run if you are truly your entire weird self.

His grandma has a beach house. We decided to get ready there. I invited my mom, who got a hotel down the beach, to come get ready with me... You know, come have a mother daughter moment with me. She bitched and complained about how I wasn't going out of my way to spend time with her and she didn't have time to come to me, I should come to her hotel room. 

After the wedding, we went to dinner where she complained about every single thing that could possibly be complained about. ""This salad has no flavor."" (To my brother) ""Where is the money you owe me?""

&gt;Set in a fantastic city pulsing with the lives of decadent nobles and daring thieves, here is a story of adventure, loyalty, and survival that is one part ""Robin Hood"", one part Ocean's Eleven, and entirely enthralling... 

&gt;A con artist of extraordinary talent, Chains passes his skills on to his carefully selected ""family"" of orphans — a group known as the Gentlemen Bastards. Under his tutelage, Locke grows to lead the Bastards, delightedly pulling off one outrageous confidence game after another. Soon he is infamous as the Thorn of Camorr, and no wealthy noble is safe from his sting.

&gt;Passing themselves off as petty thieves, the brilliant Locke and his tightly knit band of light-fingered brothers have fooled even the criminal underworld's most feared ruler, Capa Barsavi. But there is someone in the shadows more powerful — and more ambitious — than Locke has yet imagined. 

&gt;Known as the Gray King, he is slowly killing Capa Barsavi's most trusted men — and using Locke as a pawn in his plot to take control of Camorr's underworld. With a bloody coup under way threatening to destroy everyone and everything that holds meaning in his mercenary life, Locke vows to beat the Gray King at his own brutal game — or die trying...

10581,"&gt; he said he could smell her perfume that she always wore.

I'm going to be the rational one here. We had a cat. She had left her home and decided to live with us, for some unfathomable reason. So we fed her, took her to the vet, etc. She already was at least 7 when she moved in with us, and died a bit over 9 years later, so we were quite fond of her and accustomed to her. After she had gone, we would sometimes think that she was somewhere in a corner, behind a curtain, just outside the door, etc.

It's our brain playing tricks. We were expecting her to be there. Any light kind of noise or movement just outside the area of direct attention doesn't carry enough information for 100% identification, and whatever is associated with that stimulus has a chance of priming your thoughts. That makes that we got a feeling of getting a glimpse of our deceased cat. It faded over time, as memories fade. That perfume could well be a similar association. It probably faded over time as well.

You can call it cold, or you can see it as your memory slowly saying goodbye."

The one British resident I've ever talked to about it said that was his main concern. Are there any stats on what aspects of the situation people prioritize (travel, trade, immigration, politics, etc.).

If I'm reading that correctly then it would seem that the pro EU group is more educated, more qualified, has higher income and social standing, is younger and has more of an international background than the anti EU group.

10628,"It was like that at various points in the past but that style of soft nationalism became very unpopular after world war 2. A lot of this I feel has to do with the Migrant Crisis. 

It's very easy for the rich and upper middle classes to say ""we need to help all these poor refugees"" but we don't have to deal with them in any real way beyond perhaps slightly higher taxes. It's the working classes and poor, the people who are already victims of the growing socio-economic divide in the western world who see hordes of poor migrants that directly compete with them for jobs and welfare and housing and healthcare and they start to say why can our government help these people, many of who are not grateful, are disruptive to the already struggling areas they're settled into, have no allegiance or heritage in this country beyond looking for a better life (there is nothing wrong with these things and they've been said about every wave of migrants for the past century). Why are these people being helped but not us, Why is the government letting its own people suffer while spending all this money to appease the humanitarian whims of the rich and the EU.

I think we probably could have rode the post-WW2 wave of unity and anti-nationalism for another 50 years had either the migrant crisis never happened, or if european government's had practiced a little more ""charity begins at home"", so that the working class didn't see their government helping others as a betrayal or abandonment of their own people."

This is a very reddit comment.

Think about it. You get up in the morning, brush your teeth, shower, check/do your hair, and get dressed.

**Every**

**Morning**

Let's say that takes you 20-30 minutes. Let's say 25. That's almost three hours a week. Perhaps you even spend a few hours a week in the gym or sports?

Now can every guy reading this say they spend that much time ""on their brain"" a week? training it? No.

Reading fantasy novels and playing video games doesn't count.

10750,"**Concealed Carry Permit**. Most classes are relatively cheap, and provide several hours of instruction on laws, shooting skills, and proper firearm maintenance and safety. It's not the end though- keep practicing and improving beyond the class- just like you would after a drivers ed class. 

There are many resources to find out about your state's laws and procedures for receiving your permit. [HandgunLaw.us](http://www.handgunlaw.us/) is a good resource for beginning your journey, but I'd encourage you to seek our a firearm instructor/class and/or look up the laws yourself. Laws change all the time, and *HandgunLaw.us* may not always have the most up to date information.

I especially recommend Concealed Carry Permits if you are a member of traditionally targeted people- women, LGBTQ, racial minorities, etc. LGBTQ and women may be interested in looking up a [local chapter of the Pink Pistols](http://www.pinkpistols.org), a group dedicated to helping introduce and train LGBTQ/Women about firearm safety and operation for self defense.

I'd also encourage everyone to (safely) carry everywhere you can legally and as often as you can. [The police are under no obligation to protect you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_v._District_of_Columbia), and often can't be there quick enough when seconds count. It is your right (and I think your duty) to ensure your own defense if the worst should happen.

I'm happy to answer any questions about concealed carry and firearm rights.

10822,"Do you mean about how terrible the UK was in the 50's, 60's and 70's ?  
I'm no historian, I'm just old.   

After WW2 in the '50s the UK was flat broke from the war effort, most cities had been bombed and there was little cash to rebuild. Plus we owed USA a giant [loan repayment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-American_loan) for everything they lent us for the war. We bankrupted ourselves and struggled to get out of the hole. Burdened by old ""class"" attitudes and expectations we struggled to find a path.  Rationing was still in place through the '50s. Taxation was high. Pollution was a major problem.  Housing was in short supply and quick concrete high-rise ""council housing"" was thrown up in place of the old bomb damaged victorian slums. 
Major centres of industry struggled to modernise without capital 

By the 1970s labour disputes often ground the country to a halt. Electricity strikes, ""[the three day week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-Day_Week)""
At the end of it Thatcher came in and started forcibly moving the country away from an industrial economy and into a service economy, financial services and call centres. This coupled with financial deregulation triggered a boom and the economy started to grow for the first time in many years but socially it had a major detrimental  impact outside London as Coal Mining towns and Industrial centres were closed and unemployment was allowed to soar. This was part of the strategy of rebuilding the financial base of the country.

As a kid in the north of England in the mid 1980s I was STILL was surrounded by bombsites from WW2 that had not yet been cleared.  Manchester and Liverpool were equally fucked.

Adults need to realize kids try, but are just lacking the experience and epiphanies that they've had years or decades to develop. It's like yelling at a carpenter for not doing his job when you haven't given him his tools. Kids with the right tools are astounding.

Younger folks need to realize adults remember what it was like being a teenager but have traveled a long way since and gained perspective. As a teenager you're standing in the streets under the Eiffel Tower trying to appreciate it, as an adult you've traveled the streets to your balcony with a view over the city.

Everyone has a valuable perspective regardless of age, and some people are miserable cunts regardless of age.. so it's not all good news."

10909,I went through naval boot camp the summer of 2001. While there I met many people from all walks of life. Growing up a large black guy in the ghetto who listens to death metal you learn to be tolerable of peoples differences. I met a kid that was heavily bullied by his fellow recruits. We were not from the same class but often would speak in passing. I noticed he was looking more down than usual one day so I decided to chat him up. He told me he was having a hard time adjusting to this type of stress with guys constantly screwing with him. He noticed that I was always generally nice to him and in good spirits. He asked me what he could do to relive stress. I told him he had to just beat off when ever he could. About a week later someone from his division tells me they found him passed out in his rack with a sock over his dick. They woke him up and he freaked out so bad he blew blood vessels in his eyes. I found him and talked to him about it. He had given up on things getting better. I reassured him that his struggle would pay off just stick with it. He gave me a hardy handshake and said thank you. In the back of my mind I knew he may not make it. About a week later he found out his girlfriend had been raped. He swallowed all his vicodin that evening. They found him ALIVE still and got him out of there. I hope hes ok now.

I've always wondered if this reaction is actually just a discussion on semantics that gets misconstrued shortly after the first hurdle.

As a broad example, take ""teach men not to rape"". *I* know that entire thing isn't explicitly stating that all men are born rapists and are then taught out of their animalistic nature, and I'm sure most others do too. However, the phrase itself does seem to heavily imply exactly that - at least at face value. Unfortunately ""ensure that men understand the long term repercussions of both the victim and the predator in an effort to avoid sexual assault in all of its forms moving forward"" isn't exactly memorable.

11043,"DO:
*Spend lots of time thinking about what you will get, how big you what it, where you want it, and what colors you will want in it. Spend six to twelve months thinking about it after finalizing a general idea of design and layout.

*Look for a good artist. Tattooing is one of the things where you really do get what you pay for. Spend as much as you can. In my opinion, you should try to find an artist you really like personally and their work artistically. In my mind at least, doing so ensures you two will be on the same page from end to end and not be afraid of communication. As a side note, look for shops that give things like free life time touch ups (there's only one in my area, and even though they cost a pretty penny, their work is worth it, and is going to look good for the rest of your life). Be upfront with the fact that you're a first timer

*Buy lots of regular, unscented lotion beforehand. Depending on where you get them and how your skin naturally is, tattoos have a tendency to scab over for a few days or maybe even a week or so afterwords. Apply enough it doesn't itch but not a crazy amount. The tattoo shops I've all been to say not to use vasoline, but yours may say differently depending on various factors. Tattoo and area care is something you need to ask your artist about. Wash with soap and water regularly.

*Understand and prepare for pain. It's not going to feel like you got shot or something, but getting a tattoo means you have a needle sticking you hundreds to thousands of times a minute for up to a few hours. Quality work takes time, and your tattooer should be more than willing to give you a break when you need it.

DONT

*Get a name. Unless it's your god, your kid or someone who's dead, DO NOT get their name on your body. Even if they do fit into one of the three categories, think carefully as Armageddon may happen, your kid may become an asshole or the zombie of the dead person may come back to literally bite you.

*Spend too much time with your new tattoo in the sun. Exposing a new tattoo to sun, especially if you get a sun burn, will cause it to be faded. Vibrant colors will become muted, blacks will turn to more of a really dark grey, and you'll just have to get it touched up again in 6 months.

*Get pick a sensitive spot like the inside of the bicep or an area obviously exposed like your neck. The pain associated with more tender areas is probably too much for most first timers, but after you get your first few, go for it. Unless you're older than most first timers and already have a steady career, try to steer away from areas like the neck and hands. Even though tattoos are becoming more accepted, tattoos in these areas are still seen as unprofessional in many careers, and will probably affect your search in the field you want to work in. 

*Be an asshole. Your artist has the right to kick you out of the shop or not tattoo you. If you're an asshole the chances of one of these go up."

I got up and went to their bedroom to find my mom and dad both asleep. At this point I'm really starting to freak out. I woke my dad up and told him what I heard. He got a gun and went outside to check everything out. He was out there for about 15 minutes, came back in and of course nothing was out there. He said it must have been your imagination and I tried to shrug it off. He goes back to bed and I go back to my room and start reading my book again, trying to just forget about it. About 5 minutes into the book I hear 2 more taps on my window. I've never been so terrified and felt like I was being watched. I never looked out the window."

The Axis lost close to -ten times- the amount on the eastern front than they did on the western.
Not only that, the whole impact on the actual population was way heavier in the East than in was in the West. The East, and the fronts in Italy/North Africa, were already close to being won before USA fell in on D-Day.

I'm not saying USA didn't have a lot of influence, because supply wise they were huge for EU. And in the Pacific they were the main Ally force. But in EU, the majority, by far, was the UK and Russia.

Korea peacefully surrendered because **Japanese soldiers surrounded the Korean imperial palace** with threats and promised of placing Korea as a protectorate under Japan. The vast majority of Koreans collaborated with their royal emperor because that is what Koreans do.

Then a decade later, the Japanese took their warships, with knowledge learned from the British navy (which was the largest in the most advanced at the time) and entered the Korean peninsula, forcing Korea into giving up their country fully.

They assassinated our royal princess to make sure a pro-Japanese ruler came in.

And you think that Koreans were at fault? Because we surrendered peacefully to a superior military force?"

11146,"I should clarify. The thing that people don't understand that causes too many people to inevitably become failures is anxiety and depression, not the people with anxiety and depression.

Another thing. I never claimed, nor do I personally think that I'm special or unique, or deserve special treatment for having anxiety and depression. I'm not and I don't. The fact that so many people have them is proof of that. I wish I was special or unique. I wish I was the only person in existence who ever suffered from either issue. Then I could drive a knife in my neck and die happily knowing that no one would ever suffer either issue again.

Back on point, anxiety and depression are widely misunderstood. Any expert could spend their lives learning everything about anxiety and depression and never truly understand them unless they suffered from them at some point in time.

They're real problems that real people have to live with, and too much of the population doesn't see it that way. You're a perfect example of that.

There's one thing you're ever so loosely right about, though, and that's that people with these problems have to help themselves. But, it's not like they can just decide to not suffer from the problems they have anymore.

Anxiety and depression are programmed into the brain by external events. Likewise, they can only be programmed out of the brain by external events. They need external help. While it's true that the first line of every step on the path out of anxiety and depression reads ""help yourself,"" the following lines, more often than not, instruct you to seek help from others. Anything from asking a friend if they want a night out to booking an appointment with a psychologist. Unfortunately, many who suffer either issue don't have the resources to complete many of the most crucial steps, and that causes them to lose hope and not care about helping themselves anymore, even when they finally do finally get the chance to complete those steps.

It's easy to say ""I won't be irrationally scared/sad anymore."" But, the subconscious doesn't listen to your conscious beliefs or desires. If it did, no one would have anxiety or depression. Even if they will never truly understand either issue, more people should at least understand why they're an issue in the first place."

Read the comment, downvote if you want, and move on. At least that way, your opinion is lost and never acknowledged and people with the problems don't tear their hair out remembering that people like you exist, which, to be quite frank, likely makes their problems worse. Not always a lot, but any amount is too much."

11162,"Not me directly but....   Hilarious story time.

Early last year we were having some work done on the house and as responsible home owners we were getting multiple quotes.  One of the guys we had over was super friendly and after he ""left"" he sat in his car out front for a while.  It was a beautiful day and my bed room window which faces the street was open.  


While doing some cleaning I could hear a lady talking but I didn't think anything of it as it's pretty common for voices to carry from the side walk.  After a few minuets I could still hear the voice which was odd for some one walking by and I happened to be right next to the window and heard ""It's everywhere.""  This caught my attention.  I look out and there is the contractor in his car and no one else around.  I hear the voice again, clear as if I was in the car with him.  ""She said there's piss in the bed and shit all over the comforters, sheets and wall.  Like the beds are dripping onto the wood floors under them.""  Silence, his hands waving about like he's trying to land a plane on my street.  ""She said there's no way she's cleaning that up, I'm on my way now to see what happened""  More silent hand ballet.  ""I honestly don't know what he did for sure, I just know it's every where.""  


At this point  I'm baffled about what his kid did and went to find my wife to consult on what I should do to inform this guy with minimum embarrassment.  After a short discussion I head out to his car and hear him saying his good byes.  He sees me coming and puts down the window.


Him: ""Did I forget something??""

Me: ""So this is going to sound strange but if I was in your situation I'd really wanna know.""

Him: Puzzled look as if I'd just farted and is smelled like cotton candy.

Me: ""When you use your car's speaker phone, anyone outside the car can hear who your talking to.  I could hear you from my bed room up stairs as if I was in the car with you.  Couldn't hear you, but I could hear her""

Him: Facial gymnastics of embarrassment, shame and humor that I'll probably never get to see again.  ""So I own a rental cabin up in the mountains and this guy just checked out...""

You get the rest.  Poor bastard....

TLDR: Human waste every were.  Also, don't use you car as a speaker phone if you want a private conversation.  "

So when a young bright eyed 16 year old kid exposes an obvious blindspot to the manager, either because the manager thought s/he was clever in their scheme to rip off the owner or because the manager lacked the perspective to see the issue, a crushing blow to the managers' sense of pride."

11185,"Bob Ross is a very talented painter, who makes several references to his time as a traditional painter.

Apparently he just developed his fast Wet on Wet Alla Prima style so he could paint on his breaks while in the Army.

What he was so popular for was his soothing voice and being many people's gateway to painting. If you start off learning traditional grisaille and glaze, and imprimatura and impasto it can be ages before your paintings look any good. Most people's first Bob Ross style painting looks good. It gets people hooked on painting."

It appeared to be her and another young lady at the Great Wall of China. She said, ""No. That's not me. That's my cousin. We were born at the same hospital on the same day."" So I bring the science and tell her, ""There is really no way for cousins to look that much alike. Theresa, that girl is your identical twin sister."" A few days later I asked her if she had asked her parents about it. ""Yeah. They said they didn't want to talk about it."" I should mention this is a family from China during the one child era, so that points to how and why this may have happened."

The funding available to the devolved administrations is set in part based on funding levels in England. So, under a system where non-English MPs cannot vote on English issues we have a situation where English MPs dictate the levels of funding available to the devolved administrations, without representatives from these regions having any control over or input into the process.

I want to point out that I'm all for devolution in England, too, but until it happens MPs from the other home nations are going to be able to vote on English only issues because there are actually basically no English-only issues when you take into account the issue of funding.

We need a pan-UK constitutional commission to look at the future of devolution and constitutional structure in the UK."

11214,"I've had weird ass visions in dreams before, two of them come right to mind 

Growing up my dads parents were like the grandparents who put everything together, Christmases, Easters, Father's Day, thanksgiving, you name it we were always at their house, my grandmother had died and everything changed then my grandfather died a few years after her. Well after my grandfather died I had this dream I was in this house and my grandparents were there, what really happened in the dream isn't too important but as soon as I woke up I told my mom about the dream and apparently the house I was in was the one my dad grew up in, I was able to describe the house to a T from the exact layout of the kitchen, to the stairs, the way there was a mirror right above the couch.. It was all really surreal to be honest. I had never been in that house before, my grandparents sold that house in the late 80's and I was born in 1995 in a completely different town.

Second dream that's pretty weird was kind of this apocalyptic dream where I met this woman who took me in while the world was ending. Once again she took me to her house, along with a bunch of other kids and when we asked her her name she said ""my name is Anne, but you can call me Red"" she had this beautiful auburn red hair. Well when I woke up I told my mom about it and her mouth dropped. Apparently growing up there was this women growing up that used to let all the kids who lived in the neighborhood come over and give them cookies and shit and believe it or not her name was Anne but her husband used to call her Red.  Once again I described the house and the woman to a T and my mom was just beside herself. 

I don't know why but in my dreams I find myself where my parents grew up experiencing things they have been through and I'm able to describe it as if i was there. I guess there's this story about the women on my moms side of the family and their ancestry but it's really strange and I'm not sure if anyone would even believe it. Not even sure if I do. "

2. Matter-of-fact way in which ""magical"" reality is accepted. Playing with time and reality had never really been done in that way before.

3. Epic scope while still staying very personal and intimate. The characters feel so real, like you know someone that has characteristics of each of the family members. It feels like a myth that takes place in modern times.

The nurse was going through my hair with pencils (do they still do that?) and eventually pulled something that looked like this |___| out of my hair and said, ""well, here's your lice!""

I continued with my life for the next 5 years thinking that lice looked exactly like a staple.. until I was in 6th grade.  On the first day of Life Science, we were given our science book.  I cracked it open and it fell right to the page that showed pictures of lice.  At first I was confused.. this isn't what I thought lice looked like.  I didn't really remember how or why I thought lice looked like a staple... but I was sure they did.  A few moments later, all these memories came rushing back and, now that I understood sarcasm a little better, I finally realized the error of my ways.... "

I told her friend that I read the message and I weren't sure what to do, spoke to my girlfriend when she woke up, explained that if she pulls another fucking stunt like that again, I will not even give her the chance to explain. Five months later, we split up days before valentines and not even 24 hours later she was in a relationship with the guy she cheated on me with, my trust was shattered and this was 4 years ago and I've still been unable to trust another person to be in a relationship with."

11447,"This is not uncommon, I recently read the Yelp page for a restaurant where we're vacationing. 

Turns out the guests supposedly had a food allergy that could kill them but didn't bother telling their server until the salad arrived and was already served to them. They did request something different after the fact and then went and all their friends and family wrote the place 1-star reviews. 

The owner responded. They said that they didn't have any issues when they asked if everything was ok at the end of the meal. They also basically told them that next time they need to alert their server to any food allergies (is this not common sense) but also reminded them that they ordered an alcoholic drink containing whatever they were allergic to and she didn't seem to have a reaction to that...? And basically told them that they're not welcome back as customers. 

The owner copied and pasted verbatim the same response to all the friends and family that reviewed on Yelp based on the situation. 

It was kind of a shit show to read but it was clear that the 1 person in the party felt slighted but couldn't be bothered to address the problem as they came up like a reasonable human and instead just shit all over their Yelp page. "

11449,That's really stupid. Just because your dress size is 18 it doesn't mean you're suddenly 100 pounds heavier than you were when you were buying jeans from Target the previous week.

She'd show us her phone which would have their names and she'd tell us how cool they were etc. Think she would laugh that we didn't have anyone who liked us the same way or used it to boast about how more mature she was. 

When she fucked up the lie: One day she shows us a picture of her fella to show how hot he was, and I recognized the picture. She knew none of us read any gossip magazines, but the day before my cousin came round and we flicked through one by chance. The guy she claimed to be her hunky bf was a picture from the magazines 'soup tv stars when they were younger' section. I pointed this out and she hid her phone instantly.

Anna and I met in third grade. It became immediately clear to little 8 year old me that my new friend was a pathological liar on our first sleepover.  Anna brought along a doll that she said held a heart monitor in it, because she ""had SIDS when she was a baby and this doll would sound an alarm if her heart stopped"". 

I remember talking to my mom about it in the other room and just being totally baffled that my friend was claiming to have had ""sudden infant death syndrome."" 

It was the beginning of a wild and beautiful friendship filled with all sorts of harrowing and tragic tales. I've always been impressed with her creativity and theatrics. We've lost touch over the years. :( "

The EU makes a mockery of democracy, I would not want anyone to live in a society where laws are created by those who are unelected, which is exactly what happens in the EU. I agree with EU policies most of the time, however if I did not there would be no recourse. It smacks of a system that is just waiting to be abused.

Because of the way I lean on this issue I did not mail-in vote, I think it would be pretty rich for someone who is against people outside of a country telling it how to be run, to then vote in an election in a country I do not live it.

After Year of the Dragon, Insomniac ended their partnership with Universal so they could have complete control over the games and characters they made.  Doing that meant leaving their old properties like Spyro behind.  Universal was not interested in selling that license until after they gave it to other developers to churn out bland games and run the promising IP into the ground.

11517,"Just my two cents, but I was in the exact same situation as you. Used to love reading, used to love video games, but then I stopped doing either for a couple years and instead just wasted my time on social media and Reddit, or even just laying around staring at the ceiling for hours on end just waiting for something interesting to happen. I found that really changed when I started getting more active, and severely cut down on the time I spent browsing Reddit or social media or anything similar. Those things are great time wasters, and I still use them a little bit, but I'm so much happier without spending hours a day on them, and I've started to get back into reading (not video games so much, but I'm willing to give those up). I find the key to satisfaction really is self discipline, knowing when you've spent too much time lazing around and having something active that you can do whenever you want."

Excuse the comparison, again not meant offensively, but if I had an STD, I wouldn't feel the need to ever announce it to someone unless I thought that sexual contact may occur. Now, I do think the time to say that would be more that 3 seconds before clothes come off, but not at first introduction. Same with other sexual things, like, I dunno, non-functional equipment or equipment with reduced function, inability to have children, or what have you.

So yeah, I still feel there is a time and a place to announce....any particular surprises in that area, but not to everybody all the time.

It's weird. A friend asked me once what I would do if I was really into a girl and (in this scenario I had known her for awhile), and she announced she was trans, pre op, what would I do?

It actually stopped me short, because I honestly, for me, have *no idea* what I would do. Like, I don't have a natural instinct to flip about it, or say it's a deal breaker, or anything.

That said, I can see, from your perspective, how that would be a hell of a risk to take by not saying something."

11574,"Well, I had my dream job working as an engineer for the Long Island Railroad. I was so happy with my career. Every day I woke up happy and enthusiastic about my job. This was short lived as I got into a bit of a tussel with my boss, and ended up being (unjustly) fired.


I needed to support my wife and I so I took the first job available to me, a custodian in a hotel. Quite a step down from what I once had, both in prestige *and* pay.


My duties included cleaning all public areas, including the restrooms in the lobby. It was the job of the front desk staff to make sure that only guests used the bathroom, but undesirables always managed to get by. It's not their fault, they are busy answering phones and checking people in all day.


One day upon entering the men's room, I happened upon a specimen that was almost alien in nature. The smell penetrated my nostrils with the force of a Chinese-funded biological grade weapon of mass destruction. It was smack dab in the middle of the damn floor.


I got to work, I cleaned in minute long intervals, taking breaks running out the door and gasping for air. It was during this shit-cleansing process that I really started to think about what my life has become.


After cleaning that monstrous mound of feces, I vowed to turn my life around. I promised myself that as soon as I went home that night, that I would sit down and develop a step-by-step plan in reobtaining my respectable, dream job as an engineer in the railroad business.


I clocked out and after a 30 minute commute, finally arrived at my home. I eagerly opened the door and encountered my wife on the sofa getting violently and passionately fucked from behind by my next door neighbor. My hopes were shattered and I immediately fainted at the sight of this.


I still work as a custodian to this day."

**Sunday May 15th:** 30 minutes before kickoff a device is found in the mens toilets at Old Trafford (Manchester United's Stadium) by a member of staff. With Nearly 90,000 people on site, the stadium was evacuated and bomb disposal teams were brought in to locate the device and 'make it safe'. Game is postponed.

**Monday May 16th:** News stories are rife about the bomb. It emerges that Security Search Management &amp; Solutions Ltd (SSMS) were hired by a company called Deacons Canines to test its Sniffer Dog handlers. The device had been apparently left in a toilet after the training exercise, and had remained there for 4 days until matchday. 

[Chris Reid, managing director of Security Search Management &amp; Solutions Ltd, took full responsibility for the Incident](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/old-trafford-bomb-scare-manchester-united-match-abandoned-security-companies-security-search-a7031911.html).

Case Closed. [Calls were made for an Urgent Inquiry](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36297390). Not another peep was heard about it.

Now. The Conspiracy question. Ask your self why?

1 week before one of the biggest sporting events in the football calendar (Champions League), a Month before the Euros and 3 months before the Biggest sporting spectacle on the planet (Olympics), plus Multi Millon Poun investments in English Football TV and sponsorship. They dont want people to panic. They dont want people to think that someone can just walk into one of the biggest stadiums in the country with an explosive device.  They need full stadiums to push merchandise and advertising, to justify the spectacle and to inflate all of the income and line the pockets of everyone who makes off like a bandit from these international events.

Here are just a few of the inconsistencies.

1. None of the match day staff knew anything about the training drills conducted 4 days earlier. 

2. Wednesday to Sunday Man United apparently have no cleaners/staff on site? seems a little unreasonable

3. A Security desgined to conduct bomb threat events walks away from Old Trafford Stadium on Wednesday without an inventory check and knows nothing about the missing device until Sunday? hmmm unlikely. Think about it.  A company set up to train people in the event of bomb threat, in heightened security times, just leaves that shit behind. Nah.

4. The device allegedly did not contain any explosives, yet was being used to train sniffer dog teams in an exercise of locating bombs. Wot?

5. The Media JUMPED on this. Within hours this was being declared an accident. Some bloke for some small time firm puts his hands up and takes the fall. Nothing more is said. 

It's in everones interests that this just goes away, and it did. However, we do not need to look far to realise that this could well have been a very real threat, one that perhaps did not go off according to plan. Easier for Government and all interetsed parties to sweep this under the carpet and pretend there is nothing going on.

We said ""sure"" she walked us down a few blocks with the other extras to meet the production crew who happened to all be Eastern European and now the cute girls were GONE.

They walked all of us up the the 3rd floor where they were filming and it was an empty room. Before we entered I told my friend to follow my lead and we asked to use the rest room. They escorted us to the restroom, and had a guy stand at the door while we pretended to pee. I whispered to my friend this was really weird and to make a break for it. As soon as we finished we said we had to go, and one of the guys actually tried grabbing my shoulder to prevent me from leaving but we got out of there.

11687,"Did this after my boss made a bunch of loud jokes about a trans woman who had come into the store to get some ink for her printer.  I'd met her before when I had worked in a clothes store in the nearby mall and she was always sweet and pleasant. 

She didn't pass well but obviously she was happy regardless.  Just struck my heart how cruel my boss was being calling  her a ""shemale"" and how he was disgusted that he even had to ""help *it*"" and that it goes against nature and he went on and on.  

Would have quit if he hadn't started that fight with a customer who simply wanted to come through the exit to drop off some old ink cartridges and leave.  Instead my boss locked the exit  door (glass auto door that was closer to the ink return than the entrance door)  and told the guy to walk his fat ass to the entrance and he could really use it. The two got into a huge verbal altercation and I guess that was corporates last straw with this guy. 

Didn't quit until they brought in a manager from the other end of the country and realised that while he seemed like a nice guy he was a huge control freak. After getting verbals about not listening and finding out I was being paid less than my trainees,  I quit.  As far as the verbals went he pulled me into his office because I had finished a job he wanted done before he even asked and moved on to another task. It irked him that I didn't need managing because I'm a fairly independent person and i don't sit around waiting to be managed. 

Also he was super sexist and treated me like I was stupid due to the fact I was a woman. I never took a tone but would explain that I'd already done the task. he'd get worked up and accuse me of lying or that I'd done it wrong until I showed him my work and he'd get flustered and pissed and pull me aside about being insubordinate. Never once did he do it to any of my make coworkers.

11719,"One night when I was a little kid, our power went out just as it was getting dark. There was still just enough light seeping in through the blinds to where we could barely see each other. My mom, sister, and I started telling each other ghost stories and freaking each other out while waiting on my dad to come home.  I distinctly remember that we were all about to pee our pants, but we were all too scared to move. 

We heard a noise at the back of the house--it sounded like the back door opening and a few footsteps. We assumed it was my dad, but it was too early for him to be home, and our dogs were sitting in the room with us. So we waited, half-expecting him to come into the living room and announce that he got off early. But he didn't. After that, we were terrified. None of us moved out of the living room until my dad came home a little bit later through the front door.

After we told him what we heard, he grabbed a flashlight and walked around the house. We trailed behind him, clinging onto the back of his shirt for protection. He went all through the house back to my parents' bedroom, which was near the very back of the house... and suddenly my dad jumped and let out a loud, ""Ahhh, Jesus!"" One of our neighbors was sleeping in my parents' bed.

Apparently he had ""episodes."" My dad woke him up and he was extremely confused. My mom called his wife, and she was embarrassed and apologetic and said from time to time he would wander off and get confused. The thing is, he was a relatively young man... late 40s, maybe. Turns out he was just going to ask us if our power was out too, but he decided to take a nap instead. "

Said this in the other thread, but given the massive demographic divide in the vote, it's a touch cruel that the people who overwhelmingly voted to stay (young people) are the ones who will be most affected by the political and economy uncertainty sure to follow. 

Regardless of one's opinion of the Brexit -- and I think there's a lot of room for reasonable people to disagree -- I think the Leave camp should have thought about that a bit harder than they did. For a group that campaigned on the premise of not being subject to decisions from Brussels that they didn't vote for and didn't want, it seems a bit questionable to hand the Brexit to a generation that didn't vote for it and didn't want it."

This was before cell phones were a thing, and I remember calling their house and getting no answer so I figured they were just late or something.

11777,"I'm not sure I'd give it 5 years, let alone 50. The thing that made the UK and that held it together, that gave it a sense of purpose and identity, was the empire. The empire has gone and it is not coming back. For a generation or two we coasted on past grandeur, but now the existential cracks are opening pretty wide. 

We are also paying the price now for the lack of a proper constitution. Unlike most countries, we didn't have to go through the process of figuring out who we were, what we stood for, or how we would govern ourselves. We did not have a revolutionary moment of reinvention where we united nationhood to democracy. Instead these things just developed piecemeal, in a very closed and elitist way, under the leadership of an aristocratic political class. None of the unspoken assumptions on which those unwritten rules were based still hold. Tradition and muddling through can only carry us so far, before a more fundamental reassessment is needed.

I see the Brexit referendum as a strange symptom if this. There is a sense, amongst the leave camp, that if we can just get out of the EU we will travel back in time and the empire will be waiting for us, with all its old pride and certainties restored. But that ship has sailed, and sunk. I'm not sure that the UK, being at root a dynastic-imperial state, can ever be a normal European democracy. Scotland could.

But the wildcard here is England. If England can develop a non-imperial, democratic, civic, inclusive, Euro-friendly national identity, then there is hope that we can reinvent ourselves. If England insists on living in the past and on the nostalgia of Victorian-era imperialism, then the future looks grim - we will descend into a sorry parody of our former selves, an angry, backwards looking, bewildered and impoverished people.

The food was a subset of the restaurant's normal menu, but you had to choose your meal ahead of time so they could prep everything. They had a great sweets table for dessert and an open bar (with all the brewery's craft beers, it was pretty good). They had the ceremony there, and then while they went to take photos outside (30 mins tops) we ate snacks and played one of those ""how well do you know the bride and groom"" games. Then they came back and there were some short speeches and food, they didn't want to dance so there was no dancing, and everyone had a good time cause the food &amp; beer was good. :)

The decor? They put little succulents on the table with table numbers, and paper printed placemats with nametags. That was pretty much it. No one cares about that stuff after the fact. :)"

I think anything Brandon Sanderson would be amazing, as well. 

But in summary, here's the challenges each series would face :

**Witcher** - Nothing. From what I can understand, this is the most feasible contender. 

**Harry Potter** - Current Universe still being developed to be rebooted. Possible fans backlash

**Malazan** - Needs HUGE budget right out the gate.

**Wheel of Time** - 14 Books is a lot of plots to be cut for TV

**Mistborn** - Like Witcher, this is very possible too. "

11801,"Well, I'm late to the party, but when I was 12 I fell off a trampoline. Doesn't seem to dramatic, but there was a stake in the ground which went right through me, I lost a lot of blood and was dead for about 3 minutes before I was revived. 

it was fucking comfy. I'm not sure if it was just my conscience beginning to reenter my body from the void, or if I slipped into some deeper part of my mind, but it truly did feel like I was becoming one with the universe; like some great force was drawing me too it basked in warmth and light. There's no pain when you're dead. Not even the small stuff. Little things like itches on your hands or small bruises on your legs or scrapes on your knees or the weight of the world, they're meaningless. You don't realize how painful life is to live until you haven't. 

Anyways, It made me a lot less afraid of death as a whole, and a lot less anxious in my day to day life. I'm happy knowing that either after I'm dead or at least my last moments will be like that :)"

11804,"Why do people always assume that ""sex = gender"" and similar ideas are ""science""?

Transgenderism is supported by the [APA](http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx) (note that they make sure to specify that being transgender is *not* a mental disorder) and the [DSM-5](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/04/gender-dysphoria-dsm-5_n_3385287.html)

In twin studies, it's been found that [gender identity disorder is 62% heritable](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1019724712983), evidencing a prenatal or genetic influence.

Surprisingly, after 50 years of research, the most effective treatment for gender dysphoria has been found to be letting people transition to their desired sex. Imagine that. (It should go without saying that part of that transition is having your gender be recognized by others)

She really hasn't, though a lot of her detractors like to say she has. Hillary Clinton has been consistently to the left-of-center on those issues. When the center was ""no homosexuals in the military at all,"" for example, she was in favor of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. Yes, it would have been nice if she had been for all the right things from the beginning, but part of being a progressive is working on actual progress - I might prefer great leaps forward, but I would rather take a small step forward than to remain where I am.

I think, though, that good parenting absolutely involves discussing money issues with children, starting from a very young age, and doing so in a way that is intentionally age appropriate.

Most parents (at least American parents) treat money as a subject even more taboo than sex, and this secrecy around finances has exactly the same effect as it does with the topic of sex: it gives teens and young adults the idea that it is dirty and shameful, and that they shouldn't ask questions about it or understand it.

That sets kids up for becoming adults who make illogical, uninformed, poor financial decisions, because they don't understand how money works, and they got the impression from their parents that it wasn't OK to ask/talk about it."

I have had cats all my life and in that time I have known 3 that were cool with it.  One was my dad's cat Algernon; the other two are River and Echo, who are litter mates that I have now. 


Honestly, River and Echo are both pretty weird.  They're unusually bright, both play fetch like dogs (not unheard of with cats but not super common) and they are (especially Echo) *way* too good at opening doors and drawers.  


We started walking River a few months ago because she started charging the front door every chance she got. She was raised totally indoors. We gave in. If she gets 5-10 minutes of outside time in the morning she's perfectly content the rest of the day.  Then Echo wanted to do it also.

On the way back from the lake, my mom's friend was driving and somehow veered off the interstate, no one is sure how.  Car flips two or three times and lands on the roof.

That isn't to say that other countries aren't great at entertainment, but it's pretty hard to deny that in the last 120 years or so, America has produced masterpieces in music, film, and other arts. And not just a few forms of entertainment, but a ton. Your thing is super dramatic crime dramas? We got you covered. You like cheesy insect horror movies? You literally have thousands to choose from. In modern times you can sit down and have thousands of movies, TV shows, and video games at your fingertips in seconds. America had a lot to do with that at every level.

I believe we'll stay and can completely accept that. What a win for democracy.

I couldn't quite put my finger on it, like they were slightly inbred, or aliens pretending to be human."
11988,"Interesting. By what mechanism?

I first thought you might be saying it would cause planetary gravitational collapse, so I started looking into this. Neutron stars have a density of 10^17 kg/m3, which which I'm assuming is a Fermi estimate since it's a round power of 10. A cubic foot would thus be between 10^15 and 10^16 kg. (If the former figure isn't a Fermi estimate, a cubic foot is close to 3x10^15 kg, since a ft^3 is about 3% of a m^3.)

Earth's mass, conversely, is about  6x10^24 kg -- enough to dwarf the cubic foot of neutron-star-matter by a factor of around a billion. The neutron star matter wouldn't do much to the overall gravitational presence of Earth.

It might do something weird if you put it on the *surface*, though. The immense mass relative to its 'footprint' would cause it to immediately fall straight through the floor and into the mantle, pushing or destroying everything in its path, regardless of where in the crust you dropped it from. After passing through the core, it would reascend through the mantle to a point near the other side of the crust, then fall through again and again and again, many times. Not quite infinite. It would lose momentum due to resistance from the interposing matter, but I'm not sure how to calculate how much.

As long as we're not close to the drop site (or perhaps the antipode), I think we'll mostly be okay, at least for a while. Is there something I'm neglecting?

Edit: I suppose there could also be some effect due to the neutron-star-material expanding/losing cohesion due to no longer being subjected to the gravity of an actual full-size neutron star, and that could do a lot of damage, possibly very explosively. I'm not sure whether that would happen, or how to calculate the strength of the explosion if it did -- or how far into the mantle it would fall as it was happening.

The problem is you first have to have the magick to actually exist.  
I'd like to believe in telekinesis too, it's a cool concept, but I'm not just accepting it as real despite **the complete lack of credible evidence and nothing in our current understanding of the world pointing at it's existence**.  
  
With a doctorate in mechanical engineering that man should have damn well understood that if he claims the existance of telekinesis he also has to point to the empirical data that supports his statement. Believing in it despite the lack of evidence is close minded.  
  
  
And to preemptiveley clarify for everyone else:

12023,"So, two points:

1. Pregnancy hormones are much more sever than menstrual hormones. I had never experienced that level of hormonal influence before I got pregnant, it made my menstrual mood swings look tiny.

2. That said, even during pregnancy it was still things that I would have been upset about normally. I hate how my husband never washes a dish. At my baseline this is mildly annoying. During PMS this is more annoying, but I can still button my lip about it. During pregnancy I would cry over it, to a degree that I locked myself in my room because I realized logically how silly I was being. Hormones are intensifiers, they amplify your emotions. But if someone is angry over something, it's something that bothers them normally.

The times I've been accused of being on my period were almost unilaterally times that I was not. There were no hormones in play, I was just angry at someone being shitty to me, but it was this ""out"" the other person could declare to win the argument."

Then he watches some live holograms, and sighs at the fact that plutonium stocks have fallen again. Maybe he logs onto alien's version of facebook and promptly deletes a ""friend"" when his ""friend"" says some embarrasing shit like ""stop believing the lies, Ma'ar is flat, you are all being deceived, they're putting two dimensional holograms in front of our windows, wake up!""

12154,"That's sort of the entire point of social justice movements though.  Change will never happen if people are comfortable.  Disenfranchised minorities have to be assertive in order to get any traction.  Think about the civil rights movement--the people who participated in those protests were extremely disruptive.  People didn't like them, but they paid attention to them because of it.  The starting strategy of peaceful protest is literally to be so disruptive and assertive that you cannot be ignored.  And I'm sure there were people then who said things like ""It's not so much that they want equality that we don't like, it's the getting in our faces and trying to make us feel bad that they don't have equality"".  They tried other ways.  This is the one that works.  

Transgender people are still faced every day with people who doubt their existence and basic humanity.  If their lashing out against that makes you uncomfortable then take a second and imagine how they feel.  There are people who aren't chill because these issues are not ones of personal opinion for them.  They are for you or me, so it's easy to see their actions and say that they're overreactions, or that they just need to calm down and chill out.  This isn't the same as a person saying ""nobody should eat meat because XYZ"".  This is more like a sentient cow saying ""Hey, please stop eating beef because with my sentience it's apparent that we are deserving of rights and it makes me sad when my family is killed for preventable reasons"".  For minority groups, these issues affect their lives in very fundamental ways--their ability to not be fired on the spot at work, their ability to get a passport, their ability to use the goddamn restroom.  If they're not as blatant, they're still fundamental-- things like the ability to walk away from a police encounter unscathed, the ability to advance in one's workplace, or the ability to rent or own an affordable home.  So just try to understand that many of the ones who ""aren't chill"" would be a lot more ""chill"" if the society around them would stand up for them and fix some of the problems they encounter on a regular basis instead of them having to be on the defensive 24/7 just to convince people those problems exist."

12205,"When I was in 10th grade, a guy ""A"" was featured on TV on some show and soon after became quite popular in school. A also became arrogant and annoyed the living fuck out of kids at school, so a bunch of kids ganged up and made a Facebook page where they ridiculed him anonymously.

Fast forward 3 months, the page had thousands of posts, photos and comments ridiculing A, which eventually drove A to attempt suicide one night. Turns out he consumed rat poison but it didn't work and he woke up the next morning almost fine. This enraged his dad who stormed the school principal's office next day and demanded a thorough investigation. Somehow I had skipped school that day and the usual suspects were called and all of them blamed ... ME, because apparently I was the most tech savvy kid in school ( coming to think of it, every fucking kid knows how to make a Facebook page and post shit ). That very evening the police got to my home, raided my desktop computer, forced me to give up my Facebook credentials and interrogated me for an hour. I was scolded and defamed the next day at school by almost all teachers and the principal. That tipped me over the fucking edge. That turned me into [this](http://wp.xin.at/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/kungfury_04.jpg).

I created a fake profile of a hot girl, through which I texted the kids who had blamed me. I sent them a link to a RAT, under the disguise of a new game. Within 5 days, I had gathered and organised undeniable evidence of their involvement from the very beginning.

I jumped out of the bed and looked for a weapon. I couldn't find one and the noises kept getting louder so we ended up darting for the front door and driving to the police station which was about two minutes away from her house.  When we came back with a police officer her front door was wide open.  There was a trail of blood leading back to the attic door, which was also wide open. Three of the attic stairs were shattered.

I kept getting calls from him for 2-3 nights in a row, and then my roommates would answer and they lied for me--they said I got kicked out of the program and was going home. Then he starts harassing one my roommates because he thought she sounded hot on the phone. He came knocking on our apartment door, and none of us would answer... he started pounding and cussing and calling us bitches for not opening the door. We called the housing security on him and they removed him.

Later that week, he STABBED a random woman outside of the theme park where I worked. (She survived.) There were wanted posters all over our apartment complex and break room at work with a police sketch that looked exactly like him. I was 99% sure it was him, but still doubted it until he was caught within a couple of days. Sure enough, it was our psycho stalker.

But pretty misplaced reaction seeing as i don't remember progressive social policies or immigration causing the recession etc. Don't really see much reaction against what actually made people's lives harder the last few years. And now in the UK with the best case scenario putting the economy tanking for a few years, what about all the kids set to leave high school or uni in a couple of months?

12260,"Incorrect on many counts. Support for leaving the UK was already much higher than it was last year *before* the Brexit vote. Right now, Nicola Sturgeon, head of the Scottish National Party said that [""Scotland sees its future as part of the EU"".](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-scotland-referendum-eu-referendum-result-nicola-sturgeon-latest-what-it-means-a7099286.html) after 62% of Scots and every single constituency backed Remain. Certainly another referendum is required now, because the situation has dramatically changed since last year. Earlier leaving the UK meant leaving the EU and potentially not being allowed back. Today leaving the UK means *staying* in the EU.

It makes no sense to stay in the UK either. The economy is set to face a long period of uncertainty because trade will be lower than before. The question is will the Scots be welcomed back into the EU? I think its likely. Germany, France, Italy and the rest want to make certain that anyone who leaves the club doesn't enjoy economic success. For that, they'll offer a shit deal to the UK while also saying ""hey any part of the UK that was formerly a part of the EU is welcome to rejoin if they want to, provided they say so *right now*."" Doing so will send a strong message - *it is not possible for a member who leaves the EU to succeed. We'll make sure of that*

For example - look at all the posts that, if the place name changed to US instead of the country that they are now, would be called ""anti US bashing articles hurr durr"". Notice how no other country, when articles like this are posted about them, contain the same level of persecution, crying, complaining, use of the word ""circlejerk"" and thin skinned offended posters who think they're being personally attacked. Everyone else seems to take it, only Americans cry and think they're being unfairly treated when one out of maybe 20 articles says something ""bad about you"". Boohoo?

Then, look at how many ""bash America"" vs how many ""bash"" somewhere else. You only notice the US ones because why the fuck would you care about another country? There are EVEN MORE about other countries and they don't complain, yet you guys do and act like you've got it sooooo fucking hard.

12484,"Well there are a lot of different kinds of irony. The definition google gave is 'situational irony'.

It's not that its surprising, but that its is the OPPOSITE of what was expected. 

There's also verbal and dramatic, verbal can mean something like saying something with 2 meanings, just saying something and meaning something else. Dramatic is just for plays and literature and the like, basically, but its when only the audience knows whats going to happen. Brutus and the conspirators murdering Caesar was dramatic irony. We knew the whole time (going off of the shakespeare play) but Caesar didn't. I think there was verbal irony as well (dumb jokes and stuff when they spoke to caesar, and hinted at murder).

I told him if he wanted it to be like the pictures he would have to go with a custom, considering his build. 

Of course he wasn't happy and said I called him fat. I explained that given his shoulders they wouldn't fit any slim jacket unless it was custom tailored to him.  He proceeded to call my customer service line and say I called him fat.

In the end the customer line called me and asked what was up. I explained the story to them and the CS line said the exact same thing to him. He was so angry, but had no choice. "

12504,"This is going to be a frustrating story about a guy who was in high school with me, who we'll call Tim. The first few days of freshman year, we were asked to introduce ourselves, name, favourite this, favourite that, and where we're from. Well Tim mentions that he's from the Virgin Islands. Like cool, that's a pretty remote, unknown area. Tim is normal, makes some friends, making it along in high school like a well adjusted kid. But after a month or so, things start to go downhill.  
A group of us, including Tim, stayed after school waiting for their parents, texting, chatting, blah blah blah, when somebody hears Tim suddenly speaking something totally not English. And when we finally turn towards him, there he is speaking something totally exotic to someone on the phone. And we're all thinking ""oh my gosh this is so cool, I wish I spoke a foreign language"". And after his call, which like all future calls involves him speaking a lot with little time given to the other speaker to respond, we ask him what is with the sudden bilingualism. ""Oh that's Nepali, I'm from there."" Which of course is super fascinating to everyone, except for the small handful that remember both that Tim is white as printer paper and said a month before he said he's from the Virgin Islands. But I give him the benefit of the doubt because maybe I'm not understanding what ""from there"" means. Maybe he spent some time there with his parents because of their work or something, I don't know.  
 But the little lie just builds and builds into something ridiculous. Over the course of years Tim creates this persona of some Nepalese kid, with a Nepali mom and a Russian dad who worked in the KGB, both who are rich, with many successful and rich siblings, is Hindu and is very religious despite making a lot of mistakes about it, complains about racism against him, claims he has a two meter tall arranged married wife, and just a buttload of other crap he spewed any chance he got. Every substitute teacher had to know about his story, he brought it up as often as possible, and more than once we caught him talking to nobody on the phone in some minority language of Nepal, since we showed him Nepalese and claimed suddenly he couldn't read it. Some people would tolerate it but overall he was very attention seeking with it all and would not give up on it for all four years, although he didn't provide a shred of evidence for any of it. Our room teacher actually called him out on it once when she asked why his demographic form said he was born in Illinois or Indiana or something, because apparently the Virgin Islands was a lie too. Others knew his sister in a another local high school, who definitely did not  back up his story.  
Sometime senior year some of us, not including Tim, stayed after with mentioned teacher, and he came up as a topic, more specifically his pathological need to lie. We came to a thousand conclusions, from him trying to hide he's gay (arranged wife), bad household so he lives in a fantasy, something traumatic, but we decided on the easy case of him being an attention seeking kid. It wasn't destructive, just annoying. Other than the fact that he got accepted into our high school's limited-spaced summer trip to Grenada and dropped out when asked for a passport. Guess who didn't get in because of him. Like I said, frustrating story. "

I remember being in the yard and seeing the neighbors and just giving them the dirtiest fucking glare of all time because I know they've been running their mouth about me.

A specific one was an elderly lady who lived behind us and grew tomatoes in her garden. Like sweet old ladies do, she would always bring my mother tomatoes and cucumbers out of her garden when she had to many. This infuriated me because she was coming over to talk shit on me AND bring vegetables into my house which meant I had to eat cucumbers for dinner.

My mother never understood why I got so upset when she talked to the neighbors."

You're not seeing the months of seemingly innocent statements that gradually wear down your self-esteem until there's nothing left. Abuse is subtle. It's slow. They work their way into your heart and soul and mind until you truly believe that literally everything that goes wrong is your fault.

Yes, the things mentioned were obviously red flags. You and I can look at them and say, ""Wow. That's fucked up. She should leave, like right this second."" But leaving is impossible when you truly, 100% believe that you are the scum of the earth and are lucky that he will bring himself low enough to love you. 

The abuse process takes months, and by the time others notice the problems (the red flags) it is often too late for the victim to see things clearly. She's not a moron, or somehow to blame for not leaving. Being the victim of systematic abuse is like having your brain slowly replaced until no single thought is your own. It's like having an alternate reality creep in and replace your own, and questioning it ends with people thinking you're insane. It's rough, trust me.

Don was an extended rental because he had taken a job in my town and needed some time to move his family down from the big city. 

Seems ideal, right? Single guy, very busy executive, only there Monday - Thursday, and an extended rental means a nice break from washing the sheets every day. Awesome. Only it wasn't. Donathan was a musician on the side. Liked to talk about how he wrote the songs and had a colored gay boy sing them to make it ""interesting."" He also liked to engage in opinionated political discussions  before I had coffee most mornings. He liked Trump. He would play his guitar and/or mandolin quite a bit, often in the open dining room around 9 or 10pm while we were trying to wind down before bed. Possibly the worst part was that every morning he would microwave ""liquid egg product"" in a paper bowl (And I was super pregnant and that smell was... new and so, so nauseating). We have chickens that lay fresh eggs daily. He insisted on the liquid egg product.

But, bachelors gonna bachelor (even if it's short-loved) and overall we labeled him as an eccentric and generally decent fellow. One of our cats, Harold, was *obsessed* with getting into his room when Donathan was in. I mean... meowing at his door each night for hours. We felt kinda bad about that, but cats gonna cat. 


Towards the end of his stay, however, we got a notice from our internet service provider that someone had downloaded a terabyte of porn (infringing on a few copyright issues)  and we were about to be in a pickle. It took a lot of emails and explanation, but they eventually accepted that we were clear of any wrongdoing and to keep a check on guests using our internet for...  all the porn. I had a pretty awkward conversation with him the next morning using words like ""probably a previous guest but we still need to be careful"" and none of the words like ""Shemale Angels"" (the cease and desist email had come with a list of copyrighted works in question). Donathan was our last Airbnb guest. "

Even the most minute atomic interaction will necessarily deform the object in *some* way. 


In fact, based on OP's post, the object is actually *defined by* the fact that it doesnt exist in this universe. 


EDIT: of course, this all assumes that we know enough about the laws of our universe to say this. If we were to find an object such as this but somehow it *does* actually exist, it would require a radical rethinking of some of our basic understandings of the workings of the universe. The most impactful thing to do would be to study it. In fact, it would probably be the single most important object to exist in the history of mankind"

No one found out about the NSA abuse of the patriot act until a couple of years ago, and it's still working its way through the courts (it's been ruled illegal like every time but the government keeps appealing). The NDAA crap hasn't actually been tried yet, but I can guaranfuckingtee you that if they did, there would be another lawsuit. Which the government would lose, but again, these things do not happen overnight.

American courts can't rule on anything, no matter how vile, unless a case is presented to them. And you can't get a case presented to them unless you have actually been harmed by the law (this is called having standing to sue). 

So, for example, the 2012 NDAA purports to give the government the right to indefinitely detain American citizens without trial. This is, quite frankly, a hilariously flagrant violation of the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution and also Article One, Section 9, clause 2 of the same. Really, I don't know why they even bothered putting it there. There is not a single judge in this country who would support this. It literally strikes at the very foundation of the concept of the rule of law.

 But again, you can't just sue against a law unless you have actually been harmed by it. This is why the lawsuit that was filed against it failed in 2014 - the government hasn't actually tried imprisoning American citizens without trial under this act (probably because they know that shit ain't gonna fly, and they don't want to suffer from a most humiliating defeat. And having to read the combined fury of every judge from district court up to the SCOTUS. )"

Like, the Avengers and S.H.I.E.L.D. have missions all over the world on a regular basis. In DC Comics the Justice League handles a variety of worldwide and cosmic threats.

Individual heroes meanwhile do tend to just focus on a specific area or region, because realistically they can only be one place at a time. And, yeah, most of those home bases of the heroes are in the US, but not all of them. There are non-American superheroes, but they tend to not be major characters. Fun fact: in the comics, Blade is British, and there is also a Captain Britain. Black Panther and Namor have been prominently featured in Marvel comics for a long time, and they're both kings of their nations, and primarily focused on stopping threats to their people.

I'd say the most egregious example of a character/series focusing specifically on a single country for no discernible reason is Doctor Who, where inexplicably 95% of all alien invasions throughout the history of mankind seem to be focused on Great Britain."

The rationale that alternative medicine isn't hurting anyone, that it helps by giving people peace of mind, is widely used, but there are [too many stories](http://whatstheharm.net/alternativemedicine.html) of people who refuse to seek real medicine for themselves and their children because they believe in alternative medicine. And [too many people profiteering](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Mercola) from those beliefs.

Eleven hundred men went into the water. Vessel went down in 12 minutes. Didn't see the first shark for about a half an hour. Tiger. Thirteen footer. You know... you know that when you're in the water, chief? You tell by lookin' from the dorsal to the tail. Well, we didn't know... 'cause our bomb mission had been so secret, no distress signal had been sent, huh. They didn't even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, chief. The sharks come cruisin'. So we formed ourselves into tight groups. You know it's... kinda like 'ol squares in battle like uh, you see on a calendar, like the Battle of Waterloo. And the idea was, the shark goes to the nearest man and then he'd start poundin' and hollerin' and screamin' and sometimes the shark would go away. Sometimes he wouldn't go away. Sometimes that shark, he looks right into you. Right into your eyes. You know the thing about a shark, he's got... lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eye. When he comes at ya, doesn't seem to be livin'. Until he bites ya and those black eyes roll over white. And then, ah... then you hear that terrible high pitch screamin' and the ocean turns red and spite of all the poundin' and the hollerin' they all come in and rip you to pieces. Y'know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men! I don't know how many sharks there were... maybe a thousand! I don't know how many men, they averaged six an hour. On Thursday mornin' chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player, Bosun's Mate. I thought he was asleep, reached over to wake him up. He bobbed up and down in the water, just like a kinda top. Up ended him into a raft. Well... he'd been bitten in half below the waist. At noon on the fifth day, Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura saw us, he swung in low and he saw us. He was a young pilot, a lot younger than Mr. Hooper... anyway he saw us and come in low. And three hours later a big fat PBY comes down and start to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened. Waitin' for my turn. I'll never put on a lifejacket again. So, eleven hundred men went in the water, three hundred and sixteen men come out, the sharks took the rest, June the 29th 1945. Anyway, we delivered the bomb."

While traveling on a plane to some conference, the pilot came on the intercom asking if there was a Dr. on the flight and that they must come to the front of the plane immediately. Apparently someone was having severe chest pain and it did end up being a heart attack...don't worry, the patient did ended being okay, but not without some care on the flight and on the ground.


Anyways, My aunt reported to the front of the plane as well as another physician who specialized in primary care. Cardiac issues aren't exactly what my aunt sees everyday and the primary care doc hardly ever has to deal with any sort of immediate emergency within a clinic. Needless to say, the situation wasn't either of their strong suit and out of their comfort zone. Lucky for both of them, a cardiac nurse was also on the flight and my aunt said she basically did the entire assessment and plan for immediate care. My aunt said the nurse was an absolute rock star and things would not have gone so smoothly if she hadn't be there to help. 


My aunt will be one of the firsts to say that nurses don't get the credit they deserve for their knowledge and skill-set.

12881,"I was working graveyard shift at a hotel (Night Audit), 11pm-7am. 

People had quit and one of our employees was sick, so my GM (one of the nicest guys I've ever met, R.I.P.) had been working doubles every day (7am-11pm). He was exhausted and had only 8 hours to sleep.

Naturally, during those 8 hours is when a pipe began to leak in the lobby. As the GM, ordinarily he'd be the one who made any sort of call or decision about emergency situations in the hotel but I sure as shit didn't want to bother him in the middle of the only 8 hours he had to sleep. And really, what's he going to do in the middle of the night? All I needed to do is for it to last through the night until my boss could come in and then call the plumber's office when they opened.

So I had to think creatively. I went into the women's bathroom with some pocket change and bought a couple of maxipads. Then, I went into the maintenance office and got some duct tape.

I duct taped the pads over the leak, using lots of duct tape. That slowed the leak down considerably. It was dripping but only a very little.

Now I could have just stuck a bucket there to catch what's left but I didn't want our guests thinking that it was some crappy hotel. So I rearranged some of the furniture so that the leak was directly over a planter.

What little was leaking past the duct tape/maxipad went directly into the planter. 

Crisis averted and our guests were none the wiser! It lasted through the night and the leak was handled that day."

He ended up getting kicked out because he was being REALLY creepy towards my sister and it didn't end well for him. Anyways, I was house sitting and theres a knock at the back door. It's a sliding glass door, I pull the curtains back and there are two VERY scantly clad women. 

I'm too smart to get tricked, their boyfriends are obviously out there waiting for me to unlock the door so they can rush in and rob the place. I ask them what they want and they said that they were there for &gt;my first name&lt;.

how the hell did they know my name? Okay, so they caught my interest slightly. I tell them that's me and what do they want. Who sent them. They basically tell me I ""ordered them"" and it's already been paid, so if I don't open up theyre leaving and keeping the money. 

I'm ridiculously skeptical and end up telling them to go away or I was going to call the cops. I watched them walk away and out of sight. 

I called my sister and her boyfriend and told them the story. They tell me to call the police anyways and I do. Nothing comes from it.

It doesn't help that all the crap from the Term Breech Trials is still lingering in the health system, making obs both scared of breech births and inexperienced with them, so they'd much rather just cut it out.

12960,"I'll answer seriously bc whatever. I just posted this on another thread of the same title FYI.

I don't know if I qualify, because I was raised super religiously, then became decidedly agnostic which slipped into atheism for a few years.

But I'll tell my story anyway.

I was born into the Mormon church. I know reddit loves to hate on Mormonism, but I hope people that read this will appreciate that I came to the decision of my own mind and desires and undeniable feelings in my heart and my brain.

I was not raised by a very devout family at first. We didn't go often, my mom hated a big portion of the structure of the church. My sister did not like to go, I liked to go to see my friends. My parents were also both born in the church, although they stopped going around the time they started dating. My sister was conceived and they got a civil marriage.

Then, one day when I was like ten, my dad went psycho crazy super into the church... Like probably one of those people that give Mormons the cult name and image. He became super strict, never let me do anything, always used religion as a guilt inducer, claimed authority over my mom because he was the man, etc. I hated the way he was and grew to really doubt the church, especially some of the more controversial doctrine. That eventually led to me hating God.

When I graduated, I met a guy that was very apathetic about religion in general and we started dating. After a while, all my anger disappeared and I just started to care less and less. Then, I would hear stuff about church and be like THEY ARE ALL BRAINWASHED! I eventually stopped believing altogether. And I legit loved this newfound freedom. I hid it from my parents, but I was so used to lying to them anyway by that point that it didn't even phase me.

Then, I went through a very tough time, including being cheated on by my next boyfriend, losing my job for circumstances outside my control, almost becoming homeless, and losing so much weight because I could only afford to eat one item off the dollar menu a day. I was at rock bottom and I felt empty. So I did what I thought was crazy and knelt to pray. I just felt so crazy, kneeling to speak to something I legitimately thought was a joke.

I ended up ccurled on the floor bawling my eyes out. Then, I stopped all of the sudden and remembered something that happened to me when I was young. It was like someone had held a memory in front of my face that I had completely forgotten and said 'do you remember this?' It was when I was really sick when I was young and I prayed that I would feel better, and then I did. Like instantaneously. It didn't fade, it just instantly disappeared. I found myself nodding as if being asked 'remember this?' even though I didn't hear any voices or anything. After that, I just felt my whole heart tingle in this warmth that just enveloped my body from the inside and said to myself 'God loves me.' And from that moment on, I knew/know God is real. I didn't believe in Jesus or Mormonism, but I believed in God.

People can try to explain that away all they want, but I know what I felt, and it did not feel like it came from me. If felt like it came from something outside me, truly and honestly. I wrote it down the very next day. I have many times gone over that memory to see if maybe I made it up or it came from my own head, or was a placebo by my brain to cope with the hard time I was having, but I know what I felt and if I can't trust myself then what's the point of having a brain? I am and always have been smart, I do not make emotional decisions lightly. I don't believe blindly, either. I researched religions after that and I gained back my faith through effort, not blind acceptance and a shrug of the shoulders.

I have found answers through hard work. One of those answers is that while an idea may be perfect, it is often practiced imperfectly. My dad is an example of that. I have since come to my own conclusions about faith and have pretty much cut him out of my life. Meeting my husband after all this, who is a saint incarnate, also helped right my negative opinion of religious males.

So anyway, that's it. That's why I'm religious."

- Telling me all these crazy stories about his two sisters and their hijinks (I found out later he was an only child.)  
- Making up stories about how he had been in a cult as a child, and then lived in Ireland for several years (none of that was true either.)

It may simply be a cultural thing but where I'm from (Ireland)  this is not frowned upon.

I hate the weather.

In summer it's bright as fuck all day and night. After getting used to the cold winter, the heat of summer feels like torture even if it isn't *that* hot here. And if it's not hot, it's rainy and chilly. Also mosquitoes everywhere, tons of them. Hate it.

Fall is rainy and chilly. Then later it gets dark, rainy and chilly. Hate it.

In recent years, winter has been *just* cold enough to be super annoying. After getting used to the summer, the cold hits like a bitch. Then we get snow. Then it gets warmer and the snow melts. Then it gets just cold enough to freeze everything and *voila* the ground is rock hard, slippery as hell, uneven and even sharp in places. One slip and you're in a world of pain. When it's not murder frozen, it's wet and grey and brown and sloshy snow everywhere and cold and wet and grey and dark. Sun stays up from 10am to 2pm. Most days are cloudy as shit and everything's gray. When it's bright, you better bring sunglasses or be blinded by everything forever. Hate it.

Then spring rolls in and the snow melts and it gets rainy and the rain is cold and there's sloshy snow everywhere and all the sand and gravel that was used to make the streets less slippery is mixed into this nice brown shitty slushy mix that sticks to your shoes and pants and leaves sand everywhere when it dries up and somehow that sand gets everywhere like grainy god damn glitter that eats away at your soul when you lie in bed and contemplate suicide.

13124,"I've posted this in r/creepy before.  This is 100% true.

I was exploring a part of Georgia I'd never been before looking for a new place to find fossils. On Google maps I found short road that dead ended into what looked like a quarry pond and decided to check it out.  When I turned off the main road there was a perfectly normal house on the corner with an older black gentleman in a lawn chair in his yard.  So I gave him a friendly wave and turned onto the dead end road.  

This road was eerie itself because it was covered in leaves to a degree that it was clear no one had been down it in a long time.  I had just turned the vehicle around to leave when I noticed an abandoned trailer with a spectacular wasps nest built on the light fixture on the front door.  I stopped the car to take some pictures and that's when I noticed under a no trespassing sign a hand written sign that said ""TOO LATE TO SMILE.""  Needless to say every hair on my body stood on end while all the blood drained from my face.  I was sure someone had a shotgun trained on me from inside the house so I noped the fuck outta there.   

When I reached the sunshine and corner again I parked and walked over to the gentleman in the lawn chair to ask him what the story was on the trailer.  For some reason he either couldn't understand or hear me because all he said was ""pardon?"" Or ""what now?"" after every single question I asked.  That just put the creepy cherry on the fucked up sundae.   So into my vehicle I went, never to return.

Gotta pluck/bleach because if I have chin hair, it's different than if you have some stubble. If I don't wear makeup, people are gonna keep asking me if I'm feeling alright. If I don't take a moment to make sure everything I need is in the handbag that matches my outfit, I don't have everything I need. 

Don't get me started on having long hair either. I know guys have long hair too, but probably spend less time curling or straightening it.  

TLDR; If you want your lady to look nice, don't complain or joke about how long it takes to get ready."

13232,"Honestly though, I think the Unidan fiasco was part of what's wrong with this place. So the guy dropped a lot of interesting knowledge in his free time, helped some people, even probably got some of them interested in biology, sciences and so on. Yet, he dared to cheat the precious karma system, so people resorted to basically making a joke out of him, death threats, even calling his workplace and claiming that he had lost his scientific integrity (?!) and should be sacked for the sake of honesty, truth and so on. Like Reddit was some bastion of scientific knowledge and Unidan cheated the scientific world itself... Sometimes people here take this website too seriously.

Sure, maybe he gamed the system. But did it ultimately matter? Did it hurt anyone? Even if he used his 5 alts to downvote some posts, why does it matter that much? Why do the people think that it's ok to harass someone because of some Internet points? 

Honestly, I miss getting into a random thread and seeing ""Biologist here!"", followed by a lengthy and interesting post. 

And seriously, I'd rather have 1 Unidan with his interesting facts than all those ""mom's spaghetti/broken arms/tree fiddy/colby/..."" people. Even with his 5 alts."

13288,"I was dry-bit by a baby rattle snake or some other sort of viper when I was 6. I caught it at my grandparents' farm and stuck it in a mason jar. I could tell it wasn't a garter snake like I was used to catching, it was much more aggressive and tried to bite me. I took it out of the mason jar to show my dad and it bit at me. It had the two big front fangs of a viper and they couldn't get through my finger nail that it was trying to bite. After that it bit at me again and this time got flesh. It hurt real bad and I shook him away. At this point my dad said I should go let it go outside. It must have been a dry bite because I still have my hand. 

Years later I learned it would have been a poisonous snake, and brought it up to my dad and he claimed I made the whole story up. I know I didn't, and know what happened, but because of that I am hesitant to tell the story of how I got bit by a poisonous snake as a kid."

- If there is less intimacy 
- If the communication is bad
- If she/he doesn't feel the same about you and its been always the case

Relationships are complicated...but first try and see if you can talk to your partner calmly and see if you've been doing something wrong and see if you can make things better. Now one of the things I learnt about my previous relationship was that, you actually need to know about each other's personalities. So for example if one of you is an extrovert and the other is an introvert your needs are quite different. In that case to communicate effectively you need to be aware what the other person needs from you.

You may bring your carry-on baggage to the private screening area and may request a chair to sit if needed. *You will not be asked to remove or lift any article of clothing* to reveal sensitive body areas.

I just couldn’t stand that the show became so Tommy-focused and everything White Ranger.

Meanwhile, once the humans are gone, we only see the vampires attack and kill a deer. They seem crazy and rabid, but that's because the only time we really see them be crazy and rabid is when they're in crowds of blood-filled humans, or when they're trying to kill the monster that has been terrorizing their clan. They have a leader, they train dogs, they communicate in some way and are able to plan a strategic attack on the cave of the monster, Smith's house. Why wouldn't they try to kill him in his car? They know he only comes during the day, when the sun burns them, so they stay silent and indoors at that time. But at night they can move freely, and could possibly overwhelm the monster who at this point was only killing vampires at range. Earlier, they were able to reverse-engineer one of Smith's traps in an attempt to stop his rampage. They are not hunting him, they're just trying to not be hunted. Why would that street not be completely full of ravenous, murderous vampires the moment the dogs were able to be there? Why wouldn't they swarm him, ensuring that they could kill him there and then? Because the leader didn't want to do that, that would mean he wouldn't get his wife back. For all they know, he's invincible during the night as well. He wanted to try to hurt and scare Smith off, to show the others that the monster can be scared and isn't all-powerful, and that they might have a chance at getting his wife back.

They're thinking, planning, logical beings. They learn, they have a social order. Yeah, they're a little crazy and maybe they move a little too fast and sometimes act like animals. But we've never seen what they do when they aren't around humans. Who's to say there aren't vampire children, who sit near vampire elders, listening to the vampire tales of the big scary daytime boogeyman? "

Vegans actually make some pretty delicious meat substitutes (I know nothing compares to steak, but stay with me). Trying something like meatless Monday can be a great way to try more, delicious foods without really having to give anything up. It's even generally eco-friendly.

13553,"The quality of writing during the first book was bad. There were some parts where it looked like he was trying out a new technique that he learnt in class that day. The main plot was a bit predictable, but it was still interesting enough and the world lore was great. As you go through the other books, the writing quality gets better and actually gets to a standard that's acceptable for an adult writer. However, by this point he had already backed himself into a corner, by making the antagonist too powerful. He'd had the main characters consider all the realistic/interesting ways of defeating him, and then explain why that wouldn't work. This led to a very unsatisfying climax, which is why people don't like the last book. 

The reason people are so annoyed about the movie is that the main problem with the first book was the juvenile prose. This is something that could have been fixed by the script writers, giving the possibility for a great movie. But they somehow made the writing worse, and on top of that they also butchered all the good things about the book. They also generalised an already pretty standard plot, removing things that foreshadow future events and ruining the possibility for sequels (not that I mind at this point). "

13600,"When I was 15, I was all fucked up. I had run away from my dad's place a year beforehand because he was pretty addicted to crack and heroin and things got all crazy there for a while. After I ran away, I dropped out of high school and started doing a lot of different types of drugs, myself. 

  After a year of barely ever being sober, picking cigarette butts out of ashtrays, having had a gun pointed at me, witnessing a guy get stabbed and many other fucked up adventures, I kind of shook myself out of it and decided that I needed to get a job.

  While applying for work in the library, I picked up a book. It made me rediscover my love for reading and decide that I wanted to work at a book store. This was sort of a turning point in my life. I stopped doing drugs, developed a good work ethic and got an apartment. If I hadn't loved my job, I might not have been so happy and serious about it. Eventually I moved on my own to Ireland and England and then back to Canada again, got accepted as a mature student into university, and got the more technical job I have now.

Now, at this time, the MP Corps had just transitioned to Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri so my class was the first one to go through. This meant all the Drill Sergeants that would've normally been training recruits were free for the Shark attack. It was terrible. I don't remember half of it, but I kept my eye out for big bad. 

He was six foot four, shock red hair, and looked like he'd led his boy scout troop against a grizzly bear to earn their skinning patches. He had the physique of a linebacker and was joking the entire ride to the barracks. 

Then the screaming began. I'm not sure what happened and I'm pretty sure at one point I accidentally knocked a Drill Sergeants hat off of his head. I look over and see big red curled up in the fetal position crying for his mommy and at that point, I was thinking, ""Dear God, I'm not going to make it a day"". Big red ended up getting discharged, but I surprisingly made it through.

13772,"I put my apartment in Philadelphia up during the Pope visit because there was tons of hype about how ridiculously profitable it would be. I'd specifically put out feelers for any gay Catholics (yes, they exist) who wanted to come to town, if for no other reason than not wanting to find and hide any queer related ephemera in my place.

I spent over a week going back and forth with this one guy who was very interested. I should point out I was NOT planning to be present, offering up the whole space rather than just a room. I made it clear in the beginning that I wasn't looking for anything more than a renter, and this guy stressed that he felt the same way.

So color me shocked when he showed up to meet me for the keys, excused himself almost immediately to the restroom, and then came downstairs stark ass naked with his dick in his hand.

Look, the dude was a fox, and to quote Meshell Ndegeocello: ""He knocked on MY door, so what should I say no for?""

So we banged, and I was just laughing it of internally, but after a shower he had a total meltdown of guilt. Long story short, he took off and stayed at a hotel (in Delaware because by then it was WAY too late to get lodging in Philly.) I profited two grand and didn't even have to relinquish my place, and I got laid in the process."

You can also notice when he first gets to Rose's flat,  what's one of the very first things he does?  He looks in a mirror, and comments on his new appearance. He hasn't even seen what he looks like since regenerating from the war doctor.

For underneath her borders, the devil draws no lines

If you drag her muddy river, nameless bodies you will find

Whoa the fat trees of the forest have hid a thousand crimes

The calender is lyin' when it reads the present time


Whoa, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of

Mississippi, find yourself another country to be part of


Here's to the people of Mississippi

Who say the folks up north, they just don't understand

And they tremble in their shadows at the thunder of the Klan

The sweating of their souls can't wash the blood from off their hands

They smile and shrug their shoulders at the murder of a man



Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of

Mississippi, find yourself another country to be part of


Here's to the schools of Mississippi

Where they're teaching all the children that they don't have to care

All of rudiments of hatred are present everywhere

And every single classroom is a factory of despair

There's nobody learning such a foreign word as fair


Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of

Mississippi, find yourself another country to be part of



Here's to the cops of Mississippi

They're chewing their tobacco as they lock the prison door

Their bellies bounce inside them as they knock you to the floor

No they don't like taking prisoners in their private little war

Behind their broken badges there are murderers and more



Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of

Mississippi, find yourself another country to be part of


And, here's to the judges of Mississippi

Who wear the robe of honor as they crawl into the court

They're guarding all the bastions with their phony legal fort

Oh, justice is a stranger when the prisoners report

When the black man stands accused the trial is always short



Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of

Mississippi, find yourself another country to be part of



And here's to the government of Mississippi

In the swamp of their bureaucracy they're always bogging down

And criminals are posing as the mayors of the towns

They're hoping that no one sees the sights and hears the sounds

And the speeches of the governor are the ravings of a clown



Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of

Mississippi, find yourself another country to be part of


And here's to the laws of Mississippi

Congressmen will gather in a circus of delay

While the Constitution is drowning in an ocean of decay

Unwed mothers should be sterilized, I've even heard them say

Yes, corruption can be classic in the Mississippi way



Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of

Mississippi, find yourself another country to be part of



And here's to the churches of Mississippi

Where the cross, once made of silver, now is caked with rust

And the Sunday morning sermons pander to their lust

The fallen face of Jesus is choking in the dust

Heaven only knows in which God they can trust



Oh, here's to the land you've torn out the heart of

Mississippi, find yourself another country to be part of

13845,"If you like click-happy RPGs like Diablo, have a look at Din's Curse. Largely developed by one guy, the AI is more impressive here because monsters can move about the different floors of the dungeon just as much as you can, amassing armies and taking out rivals until they attack the town, sometimes while you're still a level or two below the town. Better reinforce the town's defended by recruiting mages, helping to build magic totems or traps, and equipping the townsfolk with enough food, water, money, and weapons to survive.

Good game. Also highly modable, though there isn't much of a community for it. I've replaced sounds mostly, so that the game has a darker atmosphere.

13901,"1. From how drastically we've seen the polls change over time. We've seen this in previous elections and even the primaries. [NPR] (http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/08/06/427488198/what-you-need-to-know-about-early-polls-and-how-to-read-them) agrees that early polls aren't predictive.

2. 1 isn't false. Even if it were, the statement about a double digit lead is factually incorrect, as a vast majority of polls seen have a single digit lead. Even with the skewed Bloomberg and Reuters polls, [the average is in the single digits] (http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/). Though, since my point in 1 is true, these polls aren't actually predictive. 

3. From Politico earlier this month (for 2016): Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. 

I would say that's enough electoral votes to make a big freaking difference.

4.I would say that the Trump campaign is pretty indicative of these things. He's reaching out to the angry and disenfranchised. We've seen him reach out to the broad spectrum middle class, appeal to those fed up with current politics, and reach out to the gay community after Orlando. Rather than target specific groups, he's going broad spectrum. 

I would say that's a decent strategy, as it plays off of the frustration many have with the government."

Voting IN loses nothing, and it's incredibly easy to leave in future if we have a second referendum.

13919,"Warning, very long post ahead. You guys inspired me, haven't thought about this house in years.

When I was about five my family moved to a different home due to my father changing work, it was built in the 1960s I believe and was a fairly long house. My bed room at my previous house was at the end of a decent size hall, and so my only request at that age was that our new house had this same setup and I would be happy, well, it did.

This hallway was much longer, and I could run at fast as I wanted from my room, straight into the living room, turn left into the kitchen and then turn right into the den, which was a garage that had been converted to a huge room, I remember being very excited.

First sighting happened one evening while I was sitting on a couch in the living room, something made me want to look over and down the hall instead of watching tv, so I did, there was a woman stepping out of my parents room, complete shadow, but I could see how her hair curled up near her shoulders like like they did in the 50s from her silhouette, she was wearing a sundress but she was very tall too, she just stood there for the longest, and then walked into MY ROOM! My parents seemed weirded out when I told them but kinda brushed it off. I saw this exact event happen a second time almost a year later. Both times I don't remember being scared, just really confused. Then the night terrors started, which is a story in itself, the things I would see and hear were absolutely terrifying during them.

As I got older we (being my younger brother I shared the room with) would hear knocking outside the wall of my bedroom around 3am, as if on cue sometimes. The basement was as long as the whole house, and the stairs would bring you down in about the middle, we always felt like we were being watched down there, and worse yet, the light under the den portion didn't work properly so there was a dark  half and a lit half. Large black metal support beams lined the middle of it, and many nights, we could hear what sounded like someone tapping a wrench against them, over and over.. my parents had even heard it and my dad multiple times would go down only to tell us nothing looked out of place.

Shit hit the fan though when my mother was home alone one day, dogsitting for our neighbors, she said something suddenly started trying to open the basement door, the dog she was watching starts flipping its shit and barking at the door, usually we kept the light on in the stairwell and you could see a shadow from under the door as people walked up, she swore up and down there was no shadow and it grew so violent she tore out into the front yard and waited on my dad to get home, at which point he goes and checks it out with his pistol in hand, and found all the doors to be locked up, no way someone got in. 

It wasn't until years later our neighbor on the other side of us started getting to know my parents better and coming over, she mentioned that an older woman originally lived there alone, and the basement would often flood. She saw them wheeling a body out of the back of the house, and when she asked the paramedics what had happened, they said it was like she fell down the stairs and had drowned at the bottom... this put my whole family in a state of dread, and even the neighbor seemed a bit unnerved when we told her about the things that had been going on.

I literally got used to always feeling like I was being watched, the day we finally moved and I started sleeping in my new house, I couldn't believe how at ease I felt night after night.

Sorry the story kinda jumps around a lot, we lived there for 12 years.

EDIT: Forgot to mention we had an old tube tv in our bedroom, many, many times in the middle of the night it would turn on, be on channel 90 which was just static and the volume would be full blast, this used to scare the shit out of me and my brother and still does thinking about it.

13953,"I'm working class and I am not surprised that my government doesnt help me. It doesnt want me. I'm just as much of a drain, with my illness and my minimum wage, I'm still poor, I barely can pay for everything. 
To me, personally, I want those people to have a better life than what they've left. I mean my life might be the Ritz, but its damn well better than what theyve left. (not everyone, obviously) 

I dont see 'hordes' of migrants. I see a lot of people displaced, desperate for a home. I see those people that need help and not people who refuse to integrate. I havent experienced being beaten to a job by someone who has migrated here. Ever. In fact, most of my jobs in the last 8 years, there has been literally *one* person who wasnt a british citizen. My friend is ridiculously hard working and completely deserved her position, she paid her taxes, never claimed benefits. 

I see so much thats been said in my lifetime about various groups of people and their migration to the UK. Its all the same rhetoric, just changing the country/ethnicity. The government is allowing me to suffer because it doesnt give a shit about me. But I'll be damned if that makes me kick out at people in a worse position than I am. 

The press should feel responsible for this too. They preyed on people who statistically have poor education, and low income (the working class) in order to divide everyone all over again. They know theres a lot of us. If we were together and fighting, they would be so fucked. But instead they chose to poison people against others and made  them think that the EU and migration was the reason they didnt succeed. 

I know theyve abandoned me. I just dont want anyone else to deal with that bullshit too. I might be the minority in my thinking, I dont know. I just feel really devastated. "
13954,"This is creepy, but not in a paranormal way, so I'm not sure if it fits this question or not.

My parents and sister were out of state, visiting my sick grandfather over the weekend. I'd gone up the previous week, so I was alone in the house and it was unbearably hot. I opened up the front windows and the back door to get some air circulating, then turned off most of the lights and lay sweating on the couch watching late-night TV and wishing it would cool off enough that I could go to bed.

I was halfway asleep when, through a gap in the curtains, I noticed someone walking to the front door. I sat up, grabbed our cordless phone and dialed 9-1-, while keeping my finger hovering over the last 1. Suddenly, this very faint knocking comes from the front door. I rush to the (thankfully deadbolted) door and turn on all of the outside lights, then run to the back and close and lock the door. I go to the front windows and see this unkempt guy hustling down the sidewalk, away from the house.

I call the police non-emergency line and tell them I think there's a guy who is hoping to burglarize a house in our neighborhood, and give them a good description of what he looked like and where he was heading. I see cars patrolling through the neighborhood a few times before I finally climb into bed (with every door and window securely locked, natch). 

My parents get home two nights later and I'm watching the news with them when a picture of the guy at the door flashes on the screen as part of the station's ""Most Wanted Criminals"" segment. Apparently, there was a warrant out for his arrest, he had prior convictions for armed robbery, burglary, assault, and a few other violent and non-violent felonies. The TV segment warned, ""Consider this man armed and extremely dangerous, and call for help immediately if you see him.""

I blurted out, ""He came to the house the other night!"" which of course caused my parents to panic. I thought my mom was going to insist on sleeping in my room that night, she was so freaked out. Thankfully, they caught him a few days later and he never came back to our house."
13955,Around Christmas my husband and I drove up from North Carolina to his parents' house in Maryland. We needed to get gas as we got into Richmond and the exit we got off at was straight up in the ghetto. We pulled into one gas station only to have a few large men start slowly sauntering toward us before we noped out and found another one (only slightly less sketchy). We still had people coming up to us and asking for money at this one but it wasn't quite as threatening as the first.

Struggles happen, but as are with all married couples (which we became, 6 weeks after meeting). The most important thing we've agreed on? No kids. Ever. Our excitement for each other is a private party. No additional people invited. Even one we create ourselves from our amazing relationship. Call me cheesy or downvote me to hell, I hear ya.

14001,"My introduction to Buffy was similar except season 1 disappointed me so much. I was a kid when it premiered and, fresh from an abridged version of Dracula that was by far 8-year-old me's favorite book, thought vampires *had* to be cool and serious. I saw a couple episodes of the first season while it was airing and hated it so much... Then right after season 2 came out on DVD for the first time a friend introduced me to the show by showing me Passion. I bought the first two seasons on DVD a few days later and binge watched it all before school started again after winter break.

It's been 13 years since then and I still introduce everyone new to Buffy with season 2, usually Passion then we'll start over again with the first episode of the season and go from there. When I binge watch the entire series with someone, I'll take a break before Chosen to show them Welcome to the Hellmouth but that's all of season 1 I have them watch. My boyfriend is a *huge* fan now but I don't think he's seen most of the first season ever.

14061,"After my uncle died about 8 years back, my mother and I traveled to where he had been living, with my Aunt, about 2 hours away.

We arrived fairly late, just in time for a pretty morose and tearful dinner, and I ended up getting situated for the night in the room just neighboring his.  That night I had a dream where I got up and went into this room and poked around. 

My uncle was a hunter and general outdoorsman.  In the dream, I clearly remember a bearskin rug on his bed, and fishing poles standing up in a rack nearby, along with other various trophies, rifles, etc.  I was drawn to the side table, where there was a silver ring with turquoise inlay.  I had the compulsion to pick it up and put it on, and it fit like it was made for me.  At that point the dream ended and I woke up.

The next morning we all had breakfast, then my Aunt asked if we wanted to see his room.  The door had been padlocked (old old house) and I had never seen or stepped foot in there until that point.  

As soon as my Aunt unlocked it and we stepped in, my blood ran cold.  It was *exactly* like my dream.  I was silently freaking the fuck out, and trying not to make it seem so, but lo and behold, there was that same silver ring.  I picked it up and it fit just like I remember.  No one noticed that I took it, and I never actually told anyone in my family about the dream for fear of sounding crazy."

She was publicly diagnosed as terminal a few short months after all the big stuff happened.  Husband and Wife were devastated...

My wife kept asking me if we could donate...I kept telling her no, I don't have a great feeling about this, something isn't right with it.

Well lo and behold a few months later, it comes out the wife/mother had lied about the whole thing to everyone in the community and even her own husband...""How?""  You ask?  She took her daughter to all the appts herself, while she told the husband to stay in the car.  She stuck a feeding tube up her nose and down into her stomach and fed her cannabis oil.  ""Why wouldn't anyone ask for proof?""

Well, the cannabis oil made her extremely lethargic, the mother cut the girls hair off and her skin turned a pale-ish greyish(not a lot, but the ""tired"" look).

So it all literally looked legit..until she enrolled her kid in school and they school needed doctors notes and hospital records, and upon looking for said records found nothing...

This mother had done this before as well quite a few years ago in another town a few hours away, still in the same state though.  Not with her kids, I think with her dog.  She scammed people out of literally thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.  She went to jail for like...6 months?  Has a no contact order with her children until they're 18 I think.

14114,"I was on my first real date with my now husband. Backpacking up by Mt St Helens. We stayed over at this little shelter called Bolt Camp, which is about 5-6 miles off the beaten path. You can Google it. You'll see some pics of it with a downed tree that took out part of the shelter- that is the way it was when we stayed there.

It's a beautiful hike in.  The sun was setting as we were nearing the camp.  Most of it is dirt path but there are a number of places where there are little wooden bridges.  Every time we'd cross one we'd say ""Watch out for trolls""!  Many of the trees had hollows at their bases, and as the sun went down it would shine through them, creating the illusion that they were little hobbit or fairy houses with tiny fires burning at tiny hearths.  As it got dark, we started seeing phosphorescent mushrooms, glowing an eerie green. 

It's a really neat little shelter. Dirt floor, but probably big enough for 6 people to sleep in (sans the downed tree, I think it has been rebuilt since.) The last people left a half bottle of Scotch behind, which we partook of. When we left, we left some weed and a few bottles of water behind. Kind of a take-something-leave-something little place.

Anyway, we went to sleep in the shelter. He was towards the entrance and I was towards the back. I woke up at some point, it was pitch black of course. I was facing towards the back of the shelter when I saw it- it's hard to describe. It looked like a spiderweb floating through the back of the shelter. Sort of geometric shaped, floating around, changing shapes and sort of flipping over and swapping end to end. I wasn't afraid of it, in fact I really enjoyed watching it. I'm an atheist and don't believe in ghosts, but I laid there thinking that it must have been some kind of spirit. I wanted to wake him up so he could see it too, but I didn't know him that well and figured he'd think I was crazy or wouldn't be able to see it. Anyway, I watched it for a few minutes then drifted back to sleep.

A couple of months later we were talking about our trip and I finally told him about it. His mouth dropped open. Apparently, the very next night after we returned, he was outside of his house having a smoke when he saw a thing that matched that description exactly, floating and drifting along. It finally sort of poofed out of existence in front of a bush. In its place were glowing red eyes. It DID freak him out, so he noped back into the house. We've never seen it again.

TL/DR- we brought home a ghost from the woods near Mt St Helens. We named it the Bolt Camp spirit."

It's not as if a single referendum has sent the country automatically hurtling down the gurgler and headed for inevitable disaster.

14146,"My favorite is guys who are SOOOOO macho that they're actually offended by feminine things. I was in a public hot tub drinking a Mike's hard strawberry lemonade the other day and some frat boy starts dissing me because my drink is PINK. That's all, he was offended that it was the color pink. Then he starts in on my eyebrows... Direct quote ""Your eyebrows are pretty on point, it actually makes me kind of mad. Why did you spend so much time on those JUST to come to a hot tub?"" 

The best part: I'm a fucking girl. He was mad at me, a girl, for doing traditionally feminine things like drinking fruity pink alcohol and wearing makeup to the pool. Wtf. This guys is the reason gendered products exist. "

14149,"The current neighbors are assholes because they don't actually live there.  
I live in a tenement, and while many sketchy people have passed through on a 6 month to 1 year basis, recently it turned out that the entire building was filled with pretty chill folks, and that's just perfect for me.   
However, the quietest of the residents lives right next door, barely ever saw or heard from him, until just 2 months ago when some lady started showing up in the middle of the night to bang on his door and scream to be let it for easily a half hour before it went quiet, presumably because she got inside. Most of us just prefer to mind our own business,  so not much was ever looked into about it, until one day the cops show up and arrest the man who lived there.  
It turns out, the lady claimed he had assaulted her, and he was taken away promptly, giving her time to file a restraining order against him, AND also to claim residency at that apartment, cause even though at that time she had only been around for a week or so, and I am sure of that being right next door, she had a singular piece of mail delivered to her, kept some clothes there, and that with the tenant admitting (probably while high) that she lived there for a while.  
The current status is tenant not allowed to go home due to restraining order, landlord drug their heels in filing eviction due to the messed up situation, and all the while the squatter has been inviting a new batch of strangers over nearly every day, the front door to the house as well as their apt has been kicked in and/or had the handle broken, needles found in the yard, and just general unrest and turmoil.  
They have until the 1st to get out.   
Fuck them

14168,"My former roommate recorded a concert he went to on his phone and played it back for me. It sounded like shit. I have no doubt it sounded great live, but the act of the sound going through a tiny audio input thing and then back out through shitty speakers made it sound garbled and horrible. 

Stop people, it doesn't sound good through your phone."
14169,"Agreed, It got so bad at one point, I stopped saying I was bi, despite it being the truth, and I've fallen into the habit of saying without missing a beat ""I'm gay."" which is only half true. It's far simpler to just say ""I like dick"" than to say ""I like both"" people will understand gay more than bi. Even to some of my best friends they know me as gay, because it's simply too exhausting to explain it to everyone I meet. Now don't get me wrong, the person most important to me knows the fact, but you ask some of the people around me and they'd look at you funny.

And it's even worse when gay guys have the elitist-hipster attitude of ""Gays were here first."" I've had gay men say that I could not be part of a LBGT club, despite the B being right in the name, because ""Gays were here first."" It causes so much stupid contention that isn't even warranted."

14173,"And? 

I might be biased because I work in advertising, but I don't think it's a bad thing. If my ad causes you to but product A over product B, I just consider it a pat on my back. In all reality they both probably do the same thing. They cost the same within cents of each other. One isn't worse than the other, usually. So who cares if you were ""manipulated"" into buying one over the other? You're still getting whatever it is you wanted. And if you're the kind of person who buys things because they see ads without really needing it...that's not really the advertisement's fault. "

14205,"Lowest prices are reserved for existing customers who most threaten to leave. Call up and tell them you want to cancel your service. The regular service rep will try to retain you. Grouse about the price, talk about competitors BY NAME SPECIFICALLY and tell them you really think you want to switch. The regular rep will xfrer you to ""Customer Retention"" (who have authority to give better deals). Customer retention will offer you their medium best price to stay. Tell them it is still too much (complain that you are an existing customer and that even NEW customers can get a better deal from them or one of their competitors). Then they will either speak to their supervisor and give you the BEST possible price, or they will say that's the best they can do and then YOU very firmly ask to speak to the supervisor.

Only the Customer Retention Supervisor can give the very best possible price to existing customers. Whatever they tell you they can offer is generally the best you will ever be able to get."

And she just kept quiet and continued talking and to me that is as much as she is able to confirm that yes she was wrong, at least she didn't blur out ''I wasn't sick!!'', she just shut up and let me have it because she knows it's true.

I'm just telling you this because for you or anyone else that has pent up feelings about bad parents, try that and don't stay angry they don't talk back, it's as good of a recognition you are going to get, because I'm sure they are ashamed of themselves."

The problems started on the 2nd month of him living there when I found out that when we were discussing how much he would pay for rent I was talking ""per month"" and he was talking ""for however long I stay there"". Stupid ass thought he could pay me a couple hundred at the beginning and then that was all he would ever have to pay. Luckily I got a job in a different town shortly after this so I put my house up for sale and never had a roommate again."

They literally have disciplinary hearings where it's just you and a dozen higher ups that just rip you apart while you stand there with a straight face. My husband was told to his face that he was a complete fuck up of a sailor and totally worthless as a person, and those were some of the more mild things they would say to him. They supposedly have 4 or 5 days to take disciplinary action if you do something wrong, yet they held small mistakes over his head for over a year, which didn't come to a head until he tried to take leave for the first time in a long time - which they allowed him to but let him know he'd be in trouble when he got back. It was all just so unbelievably fucked up, and I could go on and on about the many other ways that they wronged him. Worse yet, there's no one to complain to because they're all in on it! I'll spare you the long stories, but as much as I respect our service members for what they do and I support the military, we both have a lot of resentment toward the Navy for what they did to him."

14248,"My entire family lives in London, England, and when we went to visit them earlier this year I noticed that two of  my cousins were never around, even though we were there for nearly 3 weeks. 

Every time I asked my aunts where my two cousins were or how they were doing I got different answers. So I finally decided to ask my cousin (who is the sister to the two cousins that are missing)  what was going on, and why everyone is acting so sketchy. 

At first she said they were away on vacation, but I called bs on that (because why would they go on vacation when they knew we were coming 🤔) and she went silent. She said she needed to go outside for a smoke, so I figured something must be up, and I decided to go with her. 

She told me to search their names on google because she didn't want to say it out loud. I found out one of my cousins is a hitman and has been in prison for the past 3 years for murder and 2 counts of attempted murder (he's never getting out) and that the other one is also in prison for hiding him from the police but he'll be out soon. 

The worst part is the day before my mom had asked her sister where her nephews were. My aunt told her that (the one in prison for life) was a chef in the country, and the other was working out in Africa. She would even look at her phone and claim that she was texting them and that they wanted to say hello to us and sorry they couldn't be there. 

I haven't told my mom yet, but really all it would take is a simple google search. I wonder how long my family is going to keep this lie up..."
