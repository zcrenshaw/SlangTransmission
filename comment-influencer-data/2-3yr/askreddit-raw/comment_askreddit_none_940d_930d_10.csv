2,"It's wrong. Not normal. Your 2nd husband no matter what he tells you probably feels like he's just settling with you. 

Where's he supposed to be buried? Alone? "
3,Huh? Really? But they're so hot... are you sure? Have you ever seen one?

5,"It's just poor taste.

Would you want to build a white supremacist building next to the area where MLK JR was shot?"
6,"Because the basic one, the one you drink in uni at every party, the one that makes your beer-education is beer flavored water. Ours isn't great either but I think it's still better. If you really want it you can find quality stuff everywhere, America included"
7,except that time you killed someone. that was pretty bad.
8,Just seems like a lot of work just to minimize an awful event. 
9,"Broken? They were the most powerful type if I'm not wrong. Very strong stats, and their only weakness (bugs and ghost) weren't really a weakness since there was no decent bug move in Gen 1 and the Ghost Pokemon were all poison type too, thus weak against Psychic moves."
10,"I didn't click on this thread solely to downvote funhaters, but I'm not here for the donuts."
11,"It's a point of pride with me that we're not Europe.  Have you actually *seen* the modern European?

It's just embarrassing."
12,What's the worst thing he's smelled at the zoo?
13,"Yes, that it true. But there is still a limit.

6-years is a limit, after which they must be voted back in.

2-years is a limit, after which they must be voted back in.

I'm not really into politics, so correct me if I am wrong, but the only government office without a specific limit is the supreme court."
14,"Gram for gram, a gun. The world doesn't actually work like that though. 

Pieces of paper are written on every day in ways that actually influence your life. How often do you actually see guns being used? (apart from hunting or at a range) 

Anyway you didn't actually answer the question:

&gt;How does owning guns make you more free than any other western nation?   

"
15,Yes becasue I asked for it...or something. It amazes me that people feel the need to lie online for whatever bullshit reasons.
16,"Point proven, thanks. :-)"
17,"I don't know, I'm surprised transgenderism is as accepted as it is. At least the way some ""special snowflakes"" embrace it, it's not that much bigger a stretch than identifying as a helicopter."

19,"So you're saying guns are bad? You think every person doesn't deserve the right to be able to defend themselves?

Guns don't kill people. People kill people."
20,"Ditto. I have a good job making $70k/yr (rural south, my mortgage is $550 a month with taxes and homeowners insurance built in, for a 1400 sq ft brick house - none of that house hunters ""out budget is $750k for a 3 bedroom house"" bullshit) and even my bills (before food and gas) will run 50% of my take home pay. "

22,"She's probably dead. And if he has a motorcycle, statistically he's dead too."
23,Totes stealing this line.
24,"""Brilliant"" as always.  I particularly appreciate your trademark shoehorning of ""It seems"" into the third line to make it fit the meter.  Your poems are noteworthy because it's really like seeing what Shel Silverstein would produce if he didn't have tact and skill.  Keep it up, there are plenty of other sad stories from vulnerable users for you to prey upon here, and three poems from you in one thread is just not enough."
25,I'm sure the family picked them up
26,"That's hilarious.  By the way, you're very well-written.

And you're right at the exact moment of orgasm, it's hard to control, so I can totally get how we'd need to tell you we're going to cum.  

Would you ever open wide, tongue out to like try and catch some there too?"
27,"No, I'm just curious as I've never met a girl that loved it as much as you do!"
28,"In all the time you took to write that, ya could have been doing X trying to meet someone of the opposite gender. assuming you're single. oh hey ... asl lol"
29,"I feel like someone getting up and moving around gets me out of the movie more than someone looking at their phone... Admit it, your just an authoritarian and hate people not following the ""rules""."
30,"You're trading your body for cash. I'm not a prude by any means, hooking up is great, but prostitution isn't moral in my eyes."
31,The actual intended function of the downvote button. But we choose to ignore that bit
32,I think the fact they said you have 5k a month implies this is after taxes.
33,"Mispronouncing. 

"
34,"You need to separate sexism from an individual beef you have with a women. Call her out next time she makes comments on your body. That's not ok. That doesn't mean it's sexist.

A fat women is going to be shamed much more for their body than a fat man and that fat man is going to be shamed more than you for being thin. It's frustrating and no one should deal with comments about their body, but that doesn't mean men or thin people are being discriminated against."
35,The problem is that that dirty fucking oil is the backbone of alberta's economy. And one of his campaign promises was to accelerate the process and create more job in the oil industry for albertans. And this causes a lot of headache because engineres and people that work in the oil industry are getting laid off and forced into poverty. PLUS. he just added a carbon tax which is a way of kicking them while they're down. 
36,That show ran from 2005 - 2008.  It's only the definition of nostalgia if your balls didn't drop until the start of this decade.

39,"It's like when a sub reddit whines about not getting on r/all, then when they hit front page whines about getting""brigaded"" by the very users they wanted to see their posts"
40,"Tickle the inside of your high?

Edit: What the fuck? I didn't know what she meant. Jesus."
41,He still does it though... 
42,"Trick question. 

Actually, it could make people realise they should think harder about who they vote for. 

Nope, Trump voters don't think at all. "
43,There is a word for being a vegetarian who still eats fish and similiar meats. It's called a vegetarian.
44,The Midwest in genera is kinda....yucky
45,Thinking they have more value than the reality in which they will be assessed
46,"""Most part ....."""

48,"Why?

I don't date black women.  They're ugly."
49,"I'm wondering the same thing...

I'm also thinking, ""Never stick your dick in crazy."""
50,"I mean it's down to just personal opinion, but, I went to New York for like two days once and I can honestly say I never want to go back. Nothing against the architecture or culture, just everyone was an asshole. 

Although to be fair, I've never really understood how people can think some architecture is ""beautiful"" either. Just me though."

52,i dont either but for the sake of the thread... was pointing it out. 
53,It's better now. Before it got cancelled they tried too hard to be the Simpsons.
