A 40yo will know how his sinuses are going to react better than a 28yo doctor.  
You are also not factoring in how extraordinarily low-quality the medical profession operates at. I cannot come back in two weeks because you have no openings sooner than six. I need the prescription for antibiotics *now* and if I don't need them I won't fill it.  
I'm not an abject moron and I'm rather resentful I have to get approval from a puppy to gain access to basic medicine."
1,Way to keep this civil man. Please leave 
2,You just need to lower your standards so you have a better chance. 
3,"That seems pretty unreasonable to be upset about. I mean, think about it? She wants to announce a life event at a gathering with all her friends physically in attendance. Is she supposed to create a separate event just for her pregnancy announcement?

You have a birthday every year. This person has a first child once in her life. You should be happy at good things that happen to people in you're life.

And finally, the act of a happy event taking attention away from you - and that being traumatic to you is a concern. It seems not very mature. "
4,Jesus is it such a big deal? Get over it 
5,"I know, it is just the fact that when I was younger than 18 I thought of women as innocent."
6,WHAT!?!?!? a woman serving time? blaspheme! /s
7,"Obviously these issues are far more nuanced than a conspiracy of tons of people...I'm not trying to say that you are wrong for holding your opinion, I just think that everyone can gain from atleast trying to understand *why* other people think the way that they do.

Have you been to the South (assuming you live in US)? In NC, which isn't even the deep south, I have heard men call grown middle aged black men ""boy"". Many people in this society are still deeply racist. A lot of people hear black people speak in their ""dialect"" (is what I'll call it) and think that they are stupid because they do not speak like white people. I'm not saying everyone does. But there are many who do these things.

Also, I used the wrong word when I said ""assumptions"". Our society does not provide the type of class mobility or ""American Dream"" that it once did. This is obvious -- the middle class has seen their wages *decrease* over the last 20 years, and that's people of all races.  50% of new wealth goes to the tippy top of the socioeconomic pyramid.  So right now, the poor and marginalized people of our society (largely inner-city, people of color) simply do not have the same advantages of people who did not grow up poor.  This is an economic issue at its core -- but the economically disadvantaged are disproportionately *people of color*.  That's why it intrinsically is also a race issue.

You can admit that there are disadvantages to being non-white and that there are some advantages of being white without abandoning your argument. These are highly complex issues, and the media likes to make them seem black and white.  Us vs. them. Democrat vs Republican. This type of simplistic worldview is how we elect shit leaders regardless of party affiliation. Try to be a little more open-minded.

If you're a troll, I hope you enjoyed the fodder ;) "
8,"Remember, it's not *him* that's scary, it's that around 40% (I dunno, really?) of the population intend to vote for him. That's 100 million+ people who are racist pieces of ignorant shit. "

13,Are you telling me guns are as essential to have as cars and knifes? I sincerely hope not.
14,Gods and religious beliefs in general
15,Are you a cop? No? Do tell me more about how you think entire nations of law enforcement are being stupid and dangerous.

18,"Cool, regardless, most of those guys know exactly what they're getting into. They're marrying for benefits, period. And men in the military cheat with incredible frequency too. "
19,"The obvious difference is that Republicans always insist that they're going to outlaw abortion. It's a major part of their platform.

Dems have never claimed that they're going to take anyone's guns. It's just something retarded people yell about every 4 years.

20,You can't talk logic to these people
21,"going 20 miles per hour over the speed limit is also not safe. but also, while it should be used for a passing lane, where I live, it isn't. "
22,"Yes. Virgins are virgins because they don't know anything about attraction or flirting. They aren't just ""normal"" people walking around that decided not to have sex. They have no clue how to interact socially and how to read social situations. Most probably have a high degree of social anxiety and are likely super weird. 

Good luck on your search OP"

24,"I mean, it's a bit of an exaggeration I've been more than twice, but everything is super expensive in Atlanta. The aquarium in Chattanooga is much better and much cheaper, the world of coke is expensive, dragon Con and other conventions cost an arm and a leg to go, and parking alone is expensive.

Meanwhile metro Atlanta has so many nice attractions to go to at reasonable prices.

EDIT: Also downtown is super dirty and has litter everywhere."

31,"Well, when I was in the UK, it was:
Adverts - adverts - adverts - intro - adverts - adverts - adverts - adverts - 2 mins of show - adverts - adverts...

See how easy it is to make things up. I don't know where in the states you were watching TV, but your claim has never been my experience, and I've lived here my whole life. "
32,Bullshit.

37,*I'll get that later but like fuck if I'm going to thank you for that*
38,This is a stupid question.
39,Just because there is a reason doesn't make that reason stupid. Imagine if a vampire attacked you in real life. And all of a sudden stopped because you walked inside your house because you didnt invite it in. After the initial shock of HOLY SHIT VAMPIRE. You'd think that was pretty fucking stupid wouldnt you?
